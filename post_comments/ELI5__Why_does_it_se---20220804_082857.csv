"He’s a political comedian. His job is to tell the truth, into as many microphones as possible. See also him doing this for 9/11 first responder healthcare.   BTW, it’s utterly ridiculous that a country spending 4 trillion dollars per year on healthcare didn’t already cover both groups automatically. The untold waste of man hours and additional budget dollars needed to make this happen is cringe worthy.",ElectronGuru,2022-08-04T10:40:05,48

"He's the only person not directly in politics with a huge platform, putting this much work into bring awareness to veterans issues.   What he really does is platform people fighting for veterans and 9/11 victims rights and the issues they are fighting for on his shows and tv appearances.   He can also draw enough media attention and has the charisma and public trust to really put pressure on veteran hating politicians like the ones who voted against the PACT act last week.   There are alot of other veterans, veterans groups, politicians, and others fighting for things like the PACT act, Stewart just has a unique ability to get the message across.   He has a record of fighting for 9/11 victims for no other reason than it was the right thing to do and that garners him alot of public trust unlike say politicians who can be dismissed as partisan by media like fox when they try to fight for veterans rights.",[deleted],2022-08-04T12:08:21,17
"The first part of your question has been answered, so I’ll respond to the second part—is this popular among the general public—most people I’ve spoken to consider it a no-brainer and are unclear why these people were not already covered. This issue didn’t seem to gain national attention until President Biden spoke about his own son being exposed to burn pits and possibly dying from cancer as a result. It seems like this needed to be funded for many years, which to me is simply appalling. This country routinely underfunds care for people, including veterans.",fr0_like,2022-08-04T12:07:05,10

I remember watching the documentary about him advocating for 9/11 first responders. I think he knows how difficult it is to get spending bills like these to pass because of Republicans who vote against it. He had an *enormously* difficult time getting Republicans to agree to a bill for 9/11 responders because they thought it was wasteful spending. I think this is an extension of him helping out people who have been harmed.

"John Stewart has over the last few years become a big time political activist for veteran and 9/11 first responders health care. A few years ago he was literally the only reason that a bill providing health care for  9/11 first responders was passed. Much like what's happening now, he fiercely and emotionally argued for it before Congress in a very public fashion, and ultimately the Republicans that were unwilling to commit the spending changed their mind as Stewart's pleas resonated with the public.  What's happening now is I guess just a second part of that. Stewart is at this point the public face of health care for our national servicemen and so he gets a lot of the direct addresses in this conversation.",mormagils,2022-08-05T08:45:22,3

"There’s history to this issue. The Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or PACT Act, would provide $280 billion over 10 years to treat veterans suffering from exposure to toxic elements. Up until now, roughly 70% of disability claims related to toxin exposure have been denied by the VA due to a lack of evidence, data, and information from the US Department of Defense. This bill would expand VA healthcare, enabling veterans of the Vietnam War to get help from Agent Orange exposure and the veterans of modern wars to receive care for exposure to toxic burn pits. It would also provide funding for the VA to establish 31 more clinics and research centers in 19 states, and hire more employees to handle the influx of new healthcare recipients.  The bill passed with a majority vote back in March at the US House of Representatives, a 256-174 vote. In June, the US Senate passed the bill overwhelmingly at 84-14. As a formality, the Senate went to vote on it again, and a single Republican Senator managed to get 40 other Senators to vote no on the bill, forcing it to a halt by falsely claiming that the Democrat party had secretly inserted $400 billion in unrelated government spending into the bill, even though the bill had not changed at all since June.  The bill went to vote again recently, this time giving Republicans the chance to propose the following amendments to the bill: the ability to annually cap the money put into the fund, and to change the fund into discretionary spending after a decade. Both amendments failed after the vote, and the bill passed again, now in an 86-11 vote, and it is now going to President Biden’s desk. The bill still remains, effectively, unchanged since it was first introduced, so the GOP flipped their votes again because they received bad press for the previous attempt to block the bill.  Jon Stewart is a comedian, but he has also been a longtime activist for US first responders and servicemen. There have been major speeches he has given before Congress to get the survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center attack access to healthcare for the toxins they were exposed to whilst intervening. He has traveled to active combat zones and now advocates on behalf of US veterans who served in many of the more controversial wars in American history, namely Vietnam and the wars in the Middle East. His argument is that politicians should be helping these people who gave everything for their country, not to send them off to war and have them come back with no assistance whatsoever.  When the bill went to vote in March, the US House Speaker came out and said that Republicans have given tax cuts to the richest Americans back in 2017, but now refuse to help veterans dying of cancer. President Biden spoke about how passage of the bill was a top priority during his State of the Union address, which was inappropriately interrupted by a Republican Representative. Jon Stewart called it an act of hypocrisy and cruelty by the Republicans, and others said that it was ironic that this was the point at which the Republican Party was attempting to claim that they are being financially responsible.",17woodstuffa,2022-08-07T09:05:50,2

"It's because throughout all of history, every social advance we've had has come via progressive policies. Republicans talk big, but they only care about unborn kids.

"So, basically there was a political argument over budgetary issues inside of a bill. The Senate passed the bill under the agreement that the House had a solution planned out, would amend the bill as such, then pass it back. The House did not amend the bill in any way that satisfied the Senate GOP, so they voted the bill down so that the budgetary arguments could be addressed. This would have all been political procedure and delayed the bill a month or so, nothing out of the ordinary.   Then, the Democrats, being the Democrats and have all these know-nothing celebrities on their side, had one of their pet activists come out and be the attack dog instead pf dealing with the objections to the legislation.

"Exactly! You and I could say the same thing, but without the platform that he has, we're not making any headway. I would also point out that he has his detractors, but they don't have near the platform he has.   Add to that, he's very erudite.

"This is one reason I avoid politics of other countries: I don't have the background or knowledge of their systems or players. Worse yet, the most vocal all have their own agenda.   American politics is funny, because it is rife with propaganda. since the turn of the century, I've spent a lot of time refuting it, annotating my argument with reliable sources, and yet, the fools continue to spread the lies of their ""chosen ones.""   Many fall for the BS: Not only fall for it but pass it on. Too much of it comes from anonymous sources. My theory is that the Russian troll farms have been active for a lot more years than we realized. I used the word ignorant previously, but in truth, the proper term should have been feeble minded. Those are the people that are too easily fooled. They have no idea what is truth and what is not.  I have a friend in Australia that is very conservative. He has several ""trusted"" friends here in the US and they send him every right wing propaganda piece they receive, and he falls for it every time. Little things like how he was against our social safety nets, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and other things. I asked him how he'd feel if Australia repealed their socialist programs like Universal Health Care, their government pension, and so forth. Totally against it. He doesn't understand: If Australia did the same thing as what conservatives are trying to do here, his quality of life would plummet. Progressives, which includes some liberals in this country. He got a little angry when I pointed out what he'd lose if Australia followed the same gospel he was preaching.  In the case of Jon Stewart, we see a man that is pushing the government to honor the promises made to our servicemen and women. Cliché as it sounds, our elected officials can always find funds to go to war, but never enough to help those men and women that went to war. Why? It' all about money. Don't believe me? I'll point you to a book that was written \~90 years ago: [**War Is A Racket**](http://kether.com/words/butler-smedley--war-is-a-racket-1.pdf) by [Smedley Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler). He was a retired general in the US Marine Corps. (USMC) He was a conservative That attempted to run for office on the GOP ticket back in 1932. Interesting read about him on my link, but the short book he wrote was even more interesting. His solutions weren't the best, being impractical, but at least they were an attempt. If nothing else, they were a good start at solving problems.  The key is, Stewart is familiar with our history and how the government has treated vets and our own citizens over the last century. A good read would include [the Bonus Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army), [The Memorial Day Masscre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Memorial_Day_massacre), and [the Ludlow Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre). Hell, in my lifetime, I saw [The Chicago Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Chicago_riots), [the Kent State Shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings), and, more recently, [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings). He understands the nuances that only a lifetime in America could understand.   It's not easy to understand the politics of another nation: at best, you can have a brief snapshot.",Swiggy1957,2022-08-27T12:48:34,2
>Bernie at least crossed over and joined the Democratic party before he ran in the primaries.   Got a source for that claim?  https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/02/how-can-bernie-sanders-run-democratic-primary-when/,hajdean,2022-08-04T19:17:32,2
"Oh my. You sure showed me. Forgive me, but I grew up back when the Democratic party stood for progressive movements.  Maybe it's because from the day he went to Washington, he caucused with the Democratic party. Maybe it's because he ran as a Democrat during the primaries to GIVE the DNC a chance to win in 2016 (we see how well that worked) The DNC has chosen to stay ""centrist"" which, back when I first noticed politics (Just after JFK's assassination) would have placed them as Republicans. Hell, Hillary was the president of her Young Republicans group when she was in College. The only thing she didn't agree with was the racism that had been boiling since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If you recall, the Dixiecrats of the 60s were so pissed about it's passage they got off their Democratic asses and jumped over to the GOP Elephant.   Bernie, OTOH, has always been progressive. Mostly why he's been elected to offices as an independent.  Nope, Bernie is more of a Democrat in action than any democrat that's run for president in the last 50 years.   Ronald Reagan said he became never left the Democratic party: the Democratic Party left him. I could say the same thing. I'm on the left as a progressive, but the Democratic Party has chosen to emulate the GOP of the 1950s.",Swiggy1957,2022-08-05T00:35:42,1
">Oh my. You sure showed me. Forgive me  No sweat brother/sister. Glad to see you acknowledge that the DNC didn't ""rig"" anything against Bernie.   Not sure what relevance the rest of your post had to the discussion, but glad to see you've found yourself a role model in sanders. You could certainly do worse.",hajdean,2022-08-05T18:36:07,3
"Depends on what you consider rigging.  The DNC makes use of superdelegates, who are free to pick any primary candidate they want regardless of primary election results.  They make up 15% of total delegates.  These superdelegates pledged for Clinton very early on, giving her a lead over Sanders which made him appear to be behind during the campaigns.  Trailing during a campaign does make it harder to come back.  On February 12, 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, was asked by CNN's Jake Tapper, ""What do you tell voters who are new to the process who say this makes them feel like it's all rigged?"" Schultz's response was, ""Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don't have to be in a position where they are running against grass-roots activists . . . And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn't competition between them.""  So maybe you think that's fine, that the system is working as intended, but a lot of people feel differently.  Antagonizing potential general election voters will go a long way to winning the election \*shrugs\*",socialgambler,2022-08-21T11:55:17,0
