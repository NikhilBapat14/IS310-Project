"May I point the history buffs among you in the direction of King Henry VIII? When he didn’t get what he wanted from the Catholic Church, he simply started his own little club, the Church of England…  Didn’t Trump say he wanted to bring back religion? So why not unify all the US Megachurches and Televangelists under one Banner: „The Holy Church of the United States of America(tm)“ under the divine guidance of his golden Holiness, Supreme Pope Donald the First? All other pure (read: Christian) religious groupings are free to join… in subordinate roles… or face extermination.  A new Holy Scripture shall be written (doesn’t need to be complicated): „1st Commandment: Trump is always right in everything“ „2nd Commandment: Praise Trump“  It shall be carved in a large Golden Block: the Golden Gospel! Golden painted lead replica to be sold to the faithful as mandatory demonstration of devotion (makes a great holiday gift for all family members)!  It WOULD be predominantly white, yes, but totally NOT racist! And even IF… what would be so bad about that eh?  Finally, Crusades could become fashionable again!!! What‘s not to love about shining White Knights in gold(ish) armor trampling poor, foreign, non-white-shaded unbelievers and/or persons of misdefined genders?  Spreading the ‚Golden Gospel‘, building Missionary Monastery-Fortresses in the liberated dominions.  All in the shape of giant golden Trump-Towers with complimentary members-only Golf Courses (for spiritual cleansing).  These new dominions shall send grateful tithes of resources to the ‚Holy Land of the Brave‘ and buy plenty American products, lest they fall to the mortal Sin of developing a Trade Surplus!   For the sake of spiritual purity the Holy Inquisition would have the be reinstated.  Church dogma, as laid down by Golden Holiness Donald the First would be interpreted by his faithful inquisitors and justice dispensed accordingly.  The righteousness of the faithful shall be determined by their wealth (as a sign of the grace of God) and their gratefulness towards the Holy American Church. Gratefulness shall be demonstrated by buying Holy-Crypto-Coins.  Heretics (nasty people who speak out against the ,Golden Gospel‘ …and Democrats in general) would regrettably have to burned at the stake.  Those to poor to buy Holy-Crypto shall be offered a chance for redemption by joyously toiling in the fields or assembling ‚tPhones‘ (like iPhones, but wholly made by American peasants and Trump-branded, available in many colors, all Gold).  And thus, praise Trump, beginneth New and Everlasting Golden Age!  /s",archiopteryx14,2025-05-03T02:48:43,75

"When a narcissist gains unchecked power and is surrounded by fear and sycophancy, the combination of unregulated power and psychological fragility often leads to escalating instability, erratic behavior, and destructive outcomes. This is not just theoretical—it's a recurring pattern in political and corporate history, extensively supported by both qualitative and clinical literature.   This is referred to as the decompensation phase of narcissism.    From here, they begin to purge everyone around them as they become more paranoid.  That is the isolation phase.  This is also the phase where they inflict considerable harm on anything they are ruling over.  Countries and systems that are run by such a person rarely come away unscathed.    Finally the whole thing collapses.    We have the structures in place to limit the amount of damage that can happen.  Unfortunately we have an opposition party led by people who are amore worried about keeping their geriatric selves in power than to cede control to the next generation who has more energy, insight and strength to save the country from utter destruction.    I really hope a third party stands up to represent the rest of us who don’t want everything to go down in flames.",Spin_Quarkette,2025-05-03T06:11:27,2

"BREAKING: President Trump Declares He Won the Papal Election, Declares War on Catholic Church Over “Rigged Results”  VATICAN CITY— In a surprise press conference held from a hastily erected golden podium outside St. Peter’s Basilica, U.S. President Donald J. Trump announced that he had, in fact, won the papal election “by a landslide” and accused the Catholic Church of orchestrating “the most fraudulent conclave in church history.”  “The smoke was supposed to be gold, not white,” Trump said, holding up a diagram that looked suspiciously like a pizza menu. “Everyone knows it. Everyone’s saying it. I got more votes than any pope in history. Even more than Saint Peter. It’s not even close.”  The College of Cardinals, reportedly still confused by Trump’s unexpected candidacy, confirmed that Trump was not, in fact, eligible to vote, be voted for, or attend the conclave. Nonetheless, Trump claimed that “thousands, maybe millions” of ballots naming him Supreme Pontiff had mysteriously gone missing, possibly eaten by “radical leftist nuns.”  The newly elected Pope, Cardinal Francesco “Nice-a-Guy” Bellissimo, appeared visibly stunned. “I have no idea how he got in the Sistine Chapel,” he told reporters. “One moment we were praying, the next he was handing out red MAGA mitres.”  Trump has since declared the formation of a new breakaway religious order, the “Church of Greatness,” and appointed Rudy Giuliani as its first cardinal, although Giuliani immediately demanded diplomatic immunity and a large bottle of sacramental wine.  Meanwhile, Trump supporters have reportedly begun chanting “Stop the Steal (of the Eucharist)” and have erected golden altars shaped like golf carts outside the Vatican walls.  No word yet on whether Melania has agreed to become First Lady of the Papacy. “She’s thinking about it. Probably the classiest pope’s wife you’ve ever seen,” Trump added.  Stay tuned for more developments, including rumors that Trump plans to build a wall around Heaven — and make the angels pay for it.",Comfortable-Web9455,2025-05-03T03:06:37,1

"Are you kidding? I'm a life long atheist and I have never held a particularly high opinion of christians, especially in regards to their double standards. I've never been surprised by their ability to pretend like christianity is inherently moral and then simultaneously hold up and defend leaders who happily do the most immoral things imaginable...  ...but even I thought that were *some* limits to that; and that surely even the most oblivious of christians would recognize that Trump is *everything* their religion (and basic human decency) is supposed to be against, that he very clearly doesn't give a shit about them and their beliefs whatsoever except in so far as he can use them to enrich himself, and that they would've recognized this before he even became president the first time...  ...and that's not even taking into consideration *everything he's done and said since.*  If they haven't turned away from him by now, they fucking never will.",nybbleth,2025-05-03T04:46:54,8

"I'm not religious so I don't have the same perspective as you on this. I think the antichrist is a sort of parable and there have been many of them throughout time. Trump is just one of many. The point is not that he heralds some end of the world, but that he is like many who wish to be worshiped as a god.

I know I’ve seen many many many examples of folks tripping down the wrong path with that prophesy, and it would be silly to take it up seriously after the QAnon movement took it as a banner into self destruction. But… maybe it’s okay to look at it this way.  We’re about to go through something as a country. Whether this is fulfillment of some prophesy or just another trial of many we need to pass through as a species, look inward at what’s important. Helping the poor. Standing together. Safety and community and solidarity. Those are important enough to fight for. Even if there is no promise of rescue, I want to stand for those things. But prophesy does offer some hope that there’s another side to it all. Maybe it will help us through this.",Entropy_Pyre,2025-05-03T19:56:14,2

"I think we are on a similar page. I am close to being an atheist or at least an agnostic, but I still get comfort thinking of some of the saints and what they did. I was recently in a church for a funeral (first time I had been in a church in a long time) and the stained glass and statues brought me peace. The priest gave out communion but said even if you weren’t Catholic you could come up and cross your arms over your chest and he would just give a blessing. I thought that was beautiful. Catholicism and I are on separate paths, but when I saw that image of Trump as pope I was surprised at how angry and offended I got. How dare he. He doesn’t understand one bit about the devotion and lifetime of service that papal candidates have given to be considered for the honor.

"The Roman Catholic church in Germany, Austria & Switzerland has been close to splitting from the Vatican over social issues, finding it far too conservative. They'd bring most European Catholics with them.   Numbers of practicing adherents in Europe may be relatively low, but just as the Vatican won't want to lose power & influence in Europe any more than it wants to lose power & influence in the US.

"The reason I mentioned ""orange man bad"" was because that's where people start these journeys into the interpretation of prophesy -- we don't like some leader for whatever reason and we start to see them in the biblical story. That's where subs like that come from, they don't like Trump and start looking at his life through the lens of a microscope. It becomes an unhealthy obsession. Hitler was a better match, and many thought he was the antichrist, but he apparently wasn't. The point that I was making was that we can't allow our personal views to be inserted into this discernment. I don't like Trump, but I can't place what he's doing to America into the equation. Just because someone is a poor leader, poor economist, and a racist doesn't make him the antichrist, but matching Scripture *might*.  I am a Christian. I'm also a commissioned and ordained minister, and I read this Christian religious text as such. It's not a parable. Either it is accepted as a whole or rejected as a whole. There is no room for anything else -- either it is what it says it is or it's false and offers no value.   You can't believe there will be an antichrist without first believing that there is Christ, whether it's openly acknowledged or not. That being said, explore that.",twirlingmypubes,2025-05-03T11:03:19,1
