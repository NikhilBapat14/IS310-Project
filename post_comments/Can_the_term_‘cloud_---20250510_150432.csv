"”Last month, a few weeks into the random detentions and [denied entries](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained) at the US border, I was supposed to go to Princeton University as a guest lecturer to discuss global fascism. I asked the professors who invited me whether they thought it was safe to come. When I was in Turkey, European journalist friends once similarly asked me whether they’d be detained. And just as I did then, the American professors hesitated with half sentences: “Well, you know … ” It was decided that a law firm should be involved. After some back and forth, the final assessment remained unsettlingly ambiguous: “A detention is unlikely, but we cannot be sure.” Eventually, to be on the safe side, we choose the online option.”",North-Outside-5815,2025-05-10T15:05:59,1
"I’m not really sure what the term means even after reading the article, so no, this probably ain’t it. It’s just fascism and authoritarianism. Voters will either understand that or they won’t, I’m not sure there’s any kind of extra rhetoric that can be added that will suddenly wake them up.",StormOk7544,2025-05-10T15:54:06,1
It's sounds like a word that would describe the attempts to deprive people; including protected groups at the time of these actions which has been an on-going action; of their rights that's been publicly uploaded to the cloud!   But who uploaded all of these plans and actions and laid them out before they moved on their agenda and what major events will they spontaneously manifest to enable them to do-so?,postsshortcomments,2025-05-10T15:48:29,1

It will take more than terms.  Also some voted for Trump simply because he wasn’t Kamala Harris who was a weak and unlikable candidate.  Trumps presidency isn’t just a far right revival.  It’s the utter failure of the Democratic Party to provide electable candidates.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-10T15:11:52,1
"Everybody chooses safety and comfort, it's natural!   That's how fascism wins.    Putting down a bully can be a dangerous, but it's a really positive thing for society.    If we work together it's less dangerous and more achievable. That's why fascists want us isolated.    Solidarity! ",NickelBackwash,2025-05-10T16:16:29,1
blame the fascist for fascism. Your attempt at dividing the opposition is tiresome and gross.   Trump s a horrible candidate that speaks to the hate in the hearts of our fellow citizens.   Harris spoke to light and hope.  Darkness won for whatever reason.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-10T15:15:56,1
I honestly thing “weak and unlikable” is code for woman,benecere,2025-05-10T16:11:32,1
I like Harris and don’t blame her for losing the election. But like her main problem was being bidens vp. That’s what sank her. People did not like Biden. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-10T15:29:35,1
"When contrasting her with the most unlikable man in history, yeah.   When contrasting her with a pathetic weakling it seems odd.    Keep in mind that he talks tough. A lot of people are very dumb and can't see below the surface. ",NickelBackwash,2025-05-10T16:18:56,1
"I disagree. As ,any people said, they could not vote for a woman. They admit their misogyny and I believe them./",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-10T15:34:04,1
