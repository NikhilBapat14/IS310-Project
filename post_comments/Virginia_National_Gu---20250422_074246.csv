"Is she the so-called ""DEI hire"" that was mentioned when all of this happened?   If so, I hope she absolutely destroys them in court",Dennma,2025-04-22T08:05:37,54
So this moron picked a completely random person to blame this on? How the hell would he know unless he was actually diving in the river and checking the wreckage?,Bruce-7891,2025-04-22T08:26:27,36
"It's just incredibly sad to see how quickly misinformation spreads, especially when it causes so much distress, and the fact that the Army withheld Capt. Rebecca Lobach's name, that shows just how fragile things can be when there's this kind of scrutiny.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-22T08:12:15,12

"At this point of history I'm sure with every crash they will try to find someone who could even possibly be declared ""DEI"" from the pilots to the control towers, to the janitors and baggage claim guys themselves just to shift blame.",TheRabidGoose,2025-04-22T21:23:30,1
"She’s a transgender woman, this wasn’t 100% random, they just needed a scapegoat to ramp up more trans hate.",BeforeTheEmpty,2025-04-22T11:22:48,37
"The other thing that is wild to me, is that she needed protection after what he had tweeted. You would think that the fact that she is alive, would have been enough to convince right wingers that she didn't cause the crash, but I guess not.",batmanscodpiece,2025-04-22T11:51:16,6
"But even if that is what you are trying to do, it's so insanely stupid to pick a living verifiable person and think people will believe it's a pilot already reported to be dead. What she crashed then crawled out of the wreckage? Was she on the plane on 9/11 too?",Bruce-7891,2025-04-22T11:29:18,5
Sounds like the story of that daycare in North Carolina . Supposedly kids were being sacrificed to the devil but no kids were missing ? Those people went to jail for 9 years I think until they were freed . Point is conservatives always have been and always will be idiots !,Corn3076,2025-04-22T12:23:29,5
It was for the people who believe only straight white men are competent and deserve all the jobs. Any time anything goes wrong it's because of [insert not white dude here]. Like when they blamed that black mayor when that cargo ship had an engine failure and hit the bridge.  Just straight up bigots the lot of them.,Apokolypse09,2025-04-22T11:32:46,10
"The unfortunate thing is hate overrides common sense. None of the people mad actually give a shit if it’s true if it justifies their reason for hating a group of people. It’s always been this way for every minority group.  Every boogeyman scare tactic the right has used about trans people has been refuted by legitimate facts, studies and data but it’ll never make any difference to them.",BeforeTheEmpty,2025-04-22T11:32:35,5
"They weren’t mad at her for flying the helicopter, they were mad at her for existing, and flying uncrashed helicopters. ",clickmagnet,2025-04-22T13:23:16,2
"Plenty of people believed it. I saw dozens of people share it on FB, and not a single one acknowledged at any point that it was false after the fact. They'd already moved onto the next thing.",Outside-Swan-1936,2025-04-22T14:51:10,1
