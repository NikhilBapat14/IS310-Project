"I don't know much about him, but I imagine he's been given a good sum of money to avoid having to interact with much of the real world folk out there.  What little I've read, he isn't that impressive though, and while I hate judging people by their looks, he just strikes me as one of those pompous twats who really has very low self-esteem and people end up not taking them seriously.  What he's doing now should be taken seriously, but he himself likely has a heightened sense of self-importance, which isn't going to translate well in the real world, because nothing he is doing is going to get him jobs in fields adjacent to what he's doing now. Again, stereotyping on my part, it just how it feels when I see pictures of him.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-05-03T15:45:27,16
