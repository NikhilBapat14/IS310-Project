"Of course we'd be diplomatically happy about another Obama type.  But this second Trump term *has* changed Canada's relationship with the US.  First, I think most of us were willing to dismiss the first Trump term as a temporary fit of madness on the part of the American electorate. Electing Trump was insane, but it wasn't yet a *pattern.*   Besides, despite the insanity, it really did feel like there were adults in the room with Trump, pushing back against his worst impulses. Obviously nowhere near the level of accountability required, but no sense that the guardrails had completely failed.  Then Trump was elected *again*? Like, after his disastrous first term *and* trying to violently overturn the election after he lost? That isn't something you can dismiss as a one-off. It is no mere temporary fit of madness; it is evidence of something deeply wrong with America, and with a *huge* number of Americans.  And Trump's second term has already been so much crazier than his first. To describe Trump's first term, the words I would use would be things like ""bumbling,"" ""incompetent,"" and ""embarrassing."" To describe Trump's second term, I need words like ""fascism,"" and ""ruinous."" From outside looking in, Trump is tearing down America and trying to take the global economy with it. His inner circle is nothing but true believers and mindless sycophants; his supporters see nothing wrong with what he is doing; pop culture, mass media, and corporate royalty seem to have decided to accept it; and the opposition is almost comically useless. The rot has spread.  And here's the thing (from a Canadian perspective, though I suspect other US allies feel similar): America was a great ally because America was stable and predictable. America set the rules for the global order, and if you played by the rules, you prospered together. Even the worst US Presidents (Bush Jr) more or less understood how this worked. Trump is actively hostile to the idea.  Because the US was so stable, and such a large market, so much of Canada's economy depended upon stable trade with the US. That has been a productive economic relationship for both sides, for all of living memory. Trump ripping up his own trade agreement and threatening tariffs like a cheap gangster running a protection racket is a *disaster* for the Canadian economy. Even if things go back to normal in a few years, if *anything* like this pointless trade war remains remotely possible in the medium term, we can't afford to bet on sanity continuing to prevail. We have no choice but to move away from reliance upon trade with the US.  Add to that Trump's threats of annexing Canada. That shit is just so far beyond the pale. Genuinely insulting. Our grandfathers fought and died in the same wars, on the same side. Peace has benefited both countries greatly. The very idea of conflict between us was absurd. And now your President says we've been ripping you off? That we're a threat? That we only work as a state? Fuck right off. That sort of betrayal isn't something you forget quickly.  So no, going back to normal isn't on the table, not in the short-term. The damage has been done.",TheRC135,2025-04-29T11:00:38,7
We Canadians can’t just cross our fingers and let Trump tank our economy and kidnap our citizens at the border and threaten to annex and not do any pivoting. We are being threatened with annexation it’s not a small matter!! What’s a strong Canadian leader supposed to do and say?  If a sane US leader comes around in 2028 to right the ship of course there will be opportunities for new negotiations but Trump is so chaotic and fucked up that it’s not going to go back to normal overnight and we are going to be reticent to trust the pendulum won’t go back to crazy town,___wiz___,2025-04-29T10:01:43,6

I know that everything is worse and even more embarrassing now, but from a practical standpoint I still think memories are pretty short. Ideally international pressure can be applied to remove Trump, and I totally agree that America as a whole is cruising for a macroeconomic bruising. But there’s this ever-present certainty on this sub that “America will never come back from this,” which to me assumes a sense of moral responsibility on the global rich and powerful, the utter lack of which is what got us into this mess in the first place. As long as America is profitable to deal with, people will deal with America. They’ll just feel worse and worse about it until either Trump is deposed or the global economic system changes utterly, and I think people *strongly* underestimate how much the powers that be would generally prefer sweeping this under the rug and going back to business as usual.

And to me it’s like the issues are 1.) let’s stop this guy with the sledgehammer, first of all, but also 2.) these cards are awfully resilient and can probably be cobbled back together if that’s easier than tearing everything down and rebuilding. Like yeah I know those cards are going to be bent to shit going forward, but when has anyone in the past used an embarrassing American president to reshape the global world order? Sure that may be literally what’s happening right now, but only if we allow it, and being like “it’s already done” seems to be one way to allow it.",JimboAltAlt,2025-04-29T10:11:56,0

I’m sick to my stomach that it’s even a question and honestly I wish someone *would* stop us but I really can’t get past why all of a sudden *now* this guy is not only unacceptable, but so unacceptable that *now* (and only now) it’s time to start looking into alternatives. The idea that even if he’s eliminated, the damage is done feels very pernicious to me, because it suggests that the damage will be the same no matter what level of damage of power he has. And if it’s all inevitable, what are we even talking about? I’m way more invested in this than the average American, and to me the whole thing still largely feels esoteric from an economic perspective. Like obviously Canadians are right to feel deeply insulted and angry, but now what? Stop dealing with us until we get rid of him? Great! Stop dealing with us after we get rid of him? Fair enough, I guess, we can’t be trusted long term. But then what? We’ve still got hundreds of millions of people here. At what point do we become a humanitarian concern that’s even more expensive? You Canadians know how rough we have it already re: healthcare etc.; it’s not like the money from our nation’s top-heavy graft is going to us. I’m not saying this to farm sympathy; fuck that, and we collectively deserve the macroeconomic fate coming to us. But I’m not sure if “we’re going to make our rich and powerful neighbor with its insanely long and still almost-entirely peaceful border pay for the last guy disrespecting us, even incidentally due to legitimate issues of ‘trust’” is a concept that is going to have legs beyond Trump’s eventual disgrace and deposing.",JimboAltAlt,2025-04-29T10:05:54,2

If the shoe was on the other foot I personally wouldn’t advocate never trusting Canada again. More to stuff I can actually speak to, I’m not like personally mad at Montanans for voting for Trump even more often than we Pennsylvanians did.

But I don’t see the utility in reveling in the idea that things are forever completely unfixable due to the whims of a person who people only listen to because the worst people in the world have worked for decades to make it happen for their own selfish interests. Like this whole situation is both deeply tragic and theoretically a lot more fixable than people seem to think… if we start getting some positive momentum and get rid of Trump I just honestly feel that some of this “we’ll never trust America ever again ever” stuff will be somewhat short-lived, for good or ill.   Maybe it is a genuinely different perception in Australia, but from my perspective in America people have been pissed at us for as long as I’ve been alive, and generally for good reason. Maybe that’s the elephant in the room for why this “but now you’ve gone too far and there can be no forgiveness or trust” thing feels so slightly off to me. All I can do is keep stressing that Trump’s alleged plans for Canada certainly do not match those of any American I’ve ever spoken to, so the idea that his words carry so much weight both enrages me and also strikes me as geopolitically unsustainable.",JimboAltAlt,2025-04-29T20:49:05,2
"I think what I’m trying to stress is that it’s no longer seen as the whims of one person. Trump getting elected a second time after all the election overturning stuff etc. shows that it’s a more deep rooted issue in America. A large amount of Americans want a leader like trump, even if he’s breaking laws and showing authoritarian signs. That’s not going away.   I hear you about people being pissed at America for a long time, I’ve heard it plenty in Australia. But it was for different reasons. Even though people thought Americans were arrogant or whatever, they always thought they were trustworthy and stable, and that’s what really matters in alliances. That’s what’s changed now.",ZigazagyDude,2025-04-29T21:12:29,2
