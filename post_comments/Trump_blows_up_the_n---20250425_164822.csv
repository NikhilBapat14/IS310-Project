">Asked if he wanted to grow the American empire, as part of his talk about Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, Trump replied, ""If we had the right opportunity. Yeah.""   >Asked again if he wanted to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory, he replied, ""Wouldn't mind.""  And this comes at the same time he's trying to pressure Ukraine into letting russia keep some of Ukraine's territory.  Territorial conquest. It's what dictators do.",sachiprecious,2025-04-25T16:54:26,20

Maybe not a fleeting fancy but still just a fancy. It seems he refuses to make the logical journey to the idea that he is proposing an invasion. So we are stuck in an awkward place where he keeps musing about making North America into a hellish warzone but he may not even understand that.,PikachuStatue,2025-04-25T21:46:45,0

"Canada isn't worried, Canada is *angry*.  Canadians tend to be slow to anger, but once we get there, we stay there.  No one holds a grudge like we do.  We are still pissy about the Avro Arrow project, and that was in the 60's!     Damage has already been done.  The North remembers, and all that.  America voted for this, and didn't tear him out of office by his stringy dyed hair when he threatened *war* with Canada.    Because that's what it is.  We don't want to join you, and have no legal framework to do so even if we did.  We'd have to stop existing as a nation to become part of yours.  And since we are unwilling, the only avenue to get there is war.    The tariffs make us grumpy.  Threatening to destroy our nation?  Angry.  Once in a generation levels of angry.    Damage done.

That singular move, ends North America.  Remind me again, what happened in Vietnam?  Iraq?  Afghanistan?  We have 10x the population and one of the highest educated in the world.  We look like you.
