"And he won’t make any either. He is under the delusion that he has the same leverage over foreign countries that he did over the small contractors he used to swindle in New York or the spineless representatives in the Republican party in both the house and senate.  He thinks he can bully the countries into ridiculous deals or better yet, come back to the US pleading for deals.  But he lost any opportunity for real deals to occur. Every other country jumped at ensuring their country’s imports and exports continue to function. They made trade deals with other countries to make up for any losses they may have with broken promises from the US.  For example, China made a deal with Canada for Canada to supply 90% of the oil they were getting from the US. The US can’t get that trade deals back now.   Canada also made deals with European countries to supply the natural gas that the US was supplying, and the US won’t get those deals back, and why should we? We backed out of good deals that were working.  The list goes on and on, but there’s not enough time to list them.  The last cargo ships are in the ports offloading the last containers from China, and the price increases are already showing up at the cash registers.   All the other countries has worked very quickly to try to ensure as little upheaval as possible except for the United States. Our government seems to think we can wait out these countries, but they don’t need what little exports we provide. And the US will be the country that folds in the next few months.   And since all those deals have been made around the US, we have no leverage to create any deals.

"He has no leverage. Other countries actually have professionals coming up with their plans, and they all understand that Trump's supporters are due for a rude awakening when they finally realize that authoritarian dominance is a profoundly less effective strategy on the global stage than cooperation. Trump thought he could throw around America's weight and bully nations willy nilly. He thought other Presidents were just too soft to do it. Idiot.   The central premise that other nations are taking advantage of America is stupid AF. That's not how America works internationally. We're not the good guys and we're not altruistic. Every benefit we've provided (which have been many!) always came with expectations of certain returns - political deference, intelligence sharing, favoring American suppliers, and plenty more besides.   Trump trashed 100 years of investment just to get slapped in the face with the reality that America's power and prosperity didn't exist in spite of these relationships, but because of them. American exceptionalism is propaganda, these relationships were always the real source.

He's right and knows exactly what he's doing while you morons talk about shit you don't have a clue how works. Thats why he's president and you're talking dumb shit and making dumb posts on reddit. He didn't accidentally say anything. He let's all the press in at all the meeting and talks to them all day and will be the first to tell you wtf is up before your little fake journalist do after they got their orders on how to do it. That article couldn't even get a simple fact right and thought they had him on there are only 195 countries in the world bullshit. Well morons the UN recognizes 241 countries and territories when dependent territories are included. Guess they are telling us those don't trade or they simply don't know what the fuck they are talking about. Most don't when it comes to tarriffs since our federal government gave up on making all their money on mass tarrifs over 100 years ago to instead decide to get it by placing an income tax on the people they are supposed to be representing and our country has been down hill ever since. Especially since after world War 2 and the whole new globalist system our leaders set up and sold this country and all our manufacturing out so we have become a country of consumers instead of procmdcers and reliant on the hands of everybody else who also made great trade deals for their countries with the bunch of moron leaders we had making the deals or the shady ass ones getting rich selling us out. Trumps changing all that back and all you idiots want to do is work against it when if it fails it fails for this country and you are fucked too. It's happening no matter how much whining you do. Don't get me wrong politicians on both sides of the isle have put this country in a downfall. Who had power most of the time since we have been in a freefall after world War 2 ? Democrats.

Vietnam capitulated almost immediately and tried to do whatever Trump wanted but Trump never told them what he wanted and still tariffed them!  Both Canada and Japan have publicly stated that they've tried to send delegates to Washington in order to negotiate something, but there is nobody on the American side to negotiate with!    The problem is that trade is complex!  We're seeing American Automotive companies being harmed by the tariffs instead of helped, because so much of their raw materials come from overseas.  They also send parts off to Mexico and Canada to be added or manufactured, resulting in American automotive potentially being tariffed multiple times compared to an overseas manufacturer that would only be tariffed once!    Hypothetically, if you wanted to help domestic automotive and hurt forteing ones, you'd lower tariffs on the raw materials as well, and on the various pieces that are sent out and received from various locations in North America.  But that's complicated work that requires someone well-versed in how Automobiles are created and their various parts, something that Trump doesn't know, and he's not interested in letting someone with that knowledge hammer out the details.    As a result, despite nations trying to make deals with him, Trump lacks the knowledge to be able to actually make them!",kia75,2025-05-06T13:23:50,128

I read that everyone was fearful to vote for the conservative candidate that was talking similar to Trump. They were putting odds for the Liberal party to loose over double digits for weeks.,aerost0rm,2025-05-06T19:21:36,6
">So he thinks charging other countries a tariff, is the same as adding a sur-charge on top of something you sell in retail.  See, I agree with most of your comment, but not this part. He absolutely knows that we're the ones who pay the tariffs and not the other countries. He's just trying to gaslight everyone, and the sad thing it's working. Most of his base are completely convinced that other countries pay the tariffs and no amount of convincing otherwise or appeals to reason works with that crowd, even though it can be disputed with a 10 second google search. When everything on the shelves is 2-3x as expensive in a few months because there are no ships coming into port any more and backstocks start dwindling, the magats will just find a way to blame it on Biden somehow.",SanityRecalled,2025-05-07T12:12:23,1
He only thinks if it as a balance sheet. Knows the value of nothing. We’re getting stuff for that money. He’s literally that dumb and that’s why he’s also a terrible businessman. ,UnfitToPrint,2025-05-06T23:19:41,2

"One of my buddies was a HS history teacher and they were doing a unit on industrialization where he talked about the repetition and monotony of factory jobs in the late 1800s- early 1900s. If he got any pushback, he'd tell kids they didn't have to do any assignments, but he'd sit them in the back of the room, face to the wall and give them some monotonous task related to screwing on a nut to a bolt or folding paper in a certain way, sort of like Henry Ford's first assembly line.  There would be performance metrics, no talking, no discussion - just the tasks.   Very few kids made it more than a couple of days before they were ready to do the reading and do written assignments, anything to get away from the routine work.  It's just boring. People like to use their brains and also socialize at least a little.  I was",sowhat4,2025-05-06T19:17:00,4
