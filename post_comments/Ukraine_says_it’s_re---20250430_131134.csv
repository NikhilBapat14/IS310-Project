"this DEEL gets you off the shit list, the next DEEL is the one where we start considering helping with the war, and by the time the DEELs are over trump's pals are going to own all of ukraine and probably kursk oblast.  and then you get maga.",hurdurBoop,2025-04-30T13:16:01,6

Surprised Russia doesn't demand ownership of the rare earth minerals. Another country falling for Trumps extortion.,twovles31,2025-04-30T13:42:06,3
Zelenskyy should not sign any deal. It's a stupid thing to do with a POS like Trump. If there aren't any security guarantees...it's worthless.,SAJ-13,2025-04-30T13:19:04,4
"YSK: Rare earths aren't rare. They're everywhere. But, in some places more concentrated which makes it more economical to mine. So when Don repeats 'that's why they're called rare,' it's because no one else around him knows it either.",jbarchuk,2025-04-30T13:25:45,1
"Why not? What has Ukraine got to lose? If Russia wins, the US will never see an ounce that stuff - especially since most of the rare earths are in already Russian-occupied areas.",d_c_d_,2025-04-30T13:40:22,1
Zeleskyy should take the military hardware now and renege on the deal later.,biscuitarse,2025-04-30T13:35:09,3
"Maybe it is increased military support, that could be worth it. And the Us can't act on it while Russia is in control, so it could be an ok deal.  Still don't orange jesus, but it's Ukraine's call.",ianrl337,2025-04-30T13:23:30,2
