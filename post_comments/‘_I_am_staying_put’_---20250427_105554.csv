Why pass the torch when the donor money keeps rolling in, the consultant class keeps winning, and the base is told over and over again that the stakes are too high to ask for better?  Schumer’s a perfect example of how deep that rot goes. He didn’t invent performative resistance, but he’s one of its most reliable players—loud when it’s safe, silent when it matters, always ready with a press release while real change gets sidelined. He isn’t going anywhere because people like him never plan to.

I don’t think they really understand how damaging this is to the Democratic Party and brand. The whole point of being the progressive party and forward looking is to…actually be progressive and forward looking.  The entire reason that Trump gained traction in the first place was “drain the swamp” as he pointed out the hypocrisy of multi millionaire congresspeople like Nanci Pelosi making bank off their long political careers at the expense of tax payers.  Everyone will say Trump is *more corrupt*. But the point is the Democratic Party is intentionally designed to be a change agent and this behavior is so politically unpalatable it makes the entire message fall flat. Democrats are held to a different standard because *it’s their standard*,P4ULUS,2025-04-27T14:44:07,1
