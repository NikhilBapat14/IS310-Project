"Okay, but this is truly amazing. I didn't realize Sesame Street has been going after Trump since the 1980s as the trash-hoarding Donald Grump ü§£  https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sesame-street-donald-grump/",Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T22:03:50,82
">He only wants to defund NPR and PBS because Sesame Street had a character named ‚ÄúDonald Grump‚Äù  I mean, the premise of the jab is cute, but that Executive Order should dispel any belief this is petty spite.  I suppose if the joke gets attention and backlash on the EO, I won't complain. But yeah, it's far darker than this.  They linked to their article about the EO, so, I'll take it.",nerphurp,2025-05-02T22:08:04,26
"Donald Grump and he lords over Grump Tower which is built from trash cans is hilarious.  I don't think this is what is making him go after PBS, but I do appreciate Sesame Street's creativity and having a con man on their radar so early.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-02T23:34:34,26

"Oh you will be surprised to find out that there a plethora of fictional characters (most of which are villains) that were inspired by Trump. He's been hated for decades and people just don't like him, except for his cult.",randomnighmare,2025-05-03T09:06:52,14
"That's exactly what the article says. You are misinterpreting the headline and didn't read the actual article. That Muppet is not actually explaining why he's pulling funding, that Muppet is the explanation for why he's pulling funding (not necessarily the real explanation, but that's what the title is implying).   It's saying he wants to pull funding because they have made fun of him in the past. Not that they are currently explaining with a Muppet why he wants to pull funding.

"I was born in a conservative area to Gen X parents, and dad spanked us once. People at large weren't against it until around 2010, just before consent became popular morality.   It wasn't child abuse even to my younger-than-parents middle school teachers. Not was corporal punishment.   The South still has it, a Republican recently argued it as being abused to withhold from using corporal punishment on disabled children.",Gatonom,2025-05-03T06:15:24,2

"Spanking started to lose its popularity back on the 1990s. It wasn't just a thing that appeared back in the 2010s but it goes back further. It's just it became widespread in the late 1999s/ early 2000s.

"For context Redwall was set in a church as well, so godly mice being shown as compassionate and right to not spank means something. I imagine even today it would cause uproar.   My experience was certainly different than yours. What we now consider rape wasn't a thing until 2013, spanking and corporal punishment, and humiliation punishment, were acceptable into the 10s here.",Gatonom,2025-05-03T06:33:03,1
"Yeah. The conversation began in early 90s, but like seatbelts it was ""People saying it's bad"" for a long time.   Similar with non-free range parenting, ""gentle parenting"". The late 2000s was where ""No it's *wrong* not a decision to make'",Gatonom,2025-05-03T09:13:49,1
