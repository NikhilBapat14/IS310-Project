"I think old WhiskeyLeaks may be drunk again because [he had the balls to say this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=1m42s):   >”We take the classification of information very important.”   (Let’s put aside that this was somewhat garbled and not grammatically correct).    He also said:   >”When we have had leaks, which we have had here, we did a serious leak investigation. And, through that leak investigation, unfortunately, we found some folks that we believe were not holding to the protocols that we hold dear here at the Defense Department.”   But, he wasn’t talking about himself discussing classified war plans over Signal. He was talking about coworkers who may have leaked information to the media that revealed that he (Hegseth) was using Signal to communicate sensitive information to top officials as well as his wife and brother.   How dare his coworkers reveal this information?! Don’t they know that the Republican motto is “Rules for thee, not for me.”",MobileWisdom,2025-04-25T07:29:47,147

That assessment is overly kind to Hegseth. Striker had nothing but good intentions. Not only is Hegseth not doing very well, he's a totally dishonest asshat. When a totally dishonest asshat is trying to lead and is given a lot of unchecked power, and believes he must actually create disruption and chaos to achieve goals, nothing good can come from it.
