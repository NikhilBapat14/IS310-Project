"Little to nothing. The Courts are not meant to represent public sentiment. They decide the law. To quote Chief Justice Roberts, they call balls and strikes, they don't pitch or bat. That is why (in the federal courts, at least) they hold their seats for life, to insulate themselves from public sentiment and know they will not lose their jobs for being correct. If SCOTUS Justices had to get reelected every few years, stuff like Loving v. Virginia, a unanimous decision holding that interracial marriage was legal, might have ended a bit differently given that less than 20% of Americans approved of interracial marriage at the time.   Public input is the absolute *last* thing the Courts need. The public doesn't know what's good for them. The average person has never even *read* a Supreme Court decision, let alone understands the legal reasoning and language used. Most people just read a headline on Salon or something and leave it at that.",WavesAndSaves,2025-05-01T19:20:44,8
"Public input is provided via the Senate.  Humans are not infallible so don't expect better outcomes with ""more"" public input.",JKlerk,2025-05-01T12:54:53,5
"There are mechanisms in place for everything you are talking about, from the lowest to the highest courts, if I am reading your post correctly.  There are multiple procedural rules regarding disclosure of parties, specifically so that judges who have even distant connections to the parties are disqualified from hearing the case.  What you are describing (I think) in your second post is essentially covered by filing an amicus brief.   Most of the law is public record. We can all access legislation, past common law decisions, and procedural rules. It's all pretty much out there in all its exhaustively detailed glory.  Statutory law > legislation > elected representatives > we the people. Common law comes from years of working through the legal questions that individual members of the general public decide are worth suing over, and those decisions create precedents that judges adhere to instead of freeballing it or reinventing the wheel every single day. Juries represent the larger public’s values.  Does it all work perfectly? Of course not. But if you're talking about judges having to take public opinion into account when deciding cases? In essence running scared and having to be people pleasers? The whole point of the rule of law and the legal system is to NOT do that. Allowing public sentiment to run the show is what gets you vigilantism, lynching, witch burnings, and the guillotine.",scotiviator,2025-05-05T23:12:18,1
">The public doesn't know what's good for them. The average person has never even read a Supreme Court decision, let alone understands the legal reasoning and language used.  All I know is that the under the 14th Amendment you could do separate but equal, until one day separate became inherently unequal.  Guess it's just balls and strikes.  These judges are people, just like us.  The sooner the public and the judges themselves realize it, the better.",TheTrueMilo,2025-05-02T11:59:19,1
"Public input is perfectly capable of discussing the law itself and valid ways to deal with it. Briefs can point out plenty of implications of particular decisions. And in this context, it would be most usual to have associations of XYZ who hire attorneys to spell out the argument who is qualified to discuss the issue. The people in question would often be members of those associations, and the association may solicit people to be witnesses in some cases if they are parties to litigation, maybe the association takes on their case, possibly pro bono, if they meet a criteria such as being affected by a discriminatory law (especially important when standing is important. Finding the right client was essential for Rosa Park's case). And people can donate to those causes.   I am not sure what you have in mind thinking that I want supreme court judges to be elected that often. A place of that nature in a location like France has non renewable 9 year terms, so as to avoid problems, even if they are politically chosen for their post.   Public involvement in cases can allow for the millions of black people in the Civil Rights Era to help have a way to gain their rights via groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And in many of the districts with the most repression against black people, they were the majorities or nearly so, and if they could vote for sheriffs, judges, district attorneys, and could serve on juries they would have had the numbers to prevent the repression of them.",Awesomeuser90,2025-05-01T19:36:51,0
"I don't know why you are using the Senate in this context. But the judges too are falible.   Input into judicial decisions has a wide range of mechanisms, and the legal briefs being submitted are one of the best examples I can think of in this context, as well as how in some places in the world, judicial hearings are broadcast.",Awesomeuser90,2025-05-01T13:56:39,2
"Public sentiment is not merely the riotous things you bring up. It can be used for tremendous good too. The Civil Rights Era used the courts in powerful ways to get a form of justice they never should have had to fight for. Public input in this sector tends to be more of an organized process with something on the lines of an advocacy association having members or affiliates who can supply them with money and legal services, sometimes pro bono services, and can find the cases that are most likely to make an impact on the issue at hand and support them through all it might take.   As well, different court systems are more or less transparent, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for ill. Floridian judicial records are far more accessible than many in the world.   Juries could be drawn from more inclusive pools. You could eliminate the ability to strike without cause. You could pay jurors, or require their employers to pay them, so as to make it something far more people can do without disruption, in addition to protecting employee rights to not be dismissed without a lot of good reasons that you would see in a place like Germany or the Netherlands. Same with grand juries too I might add, they could be drawn from better pools of people. It might be worth considering whether the constitution should allow for say a jury of 15 but need only 12 or 13 for a conviction, given some paradoxes we see in jury decisionmaking, something closer to British juries, to also avoid inducing hung juries on purpose as a trial tactic rather than trying to find truth. British courts also have lay magistrates for lower level decisions, as do many other countries with civil law systems.   You could even incorporate reforms to the system of post secondary education financing and student support to allow a much broader subset of the population to go to law school with less bias in wealth or class than it might be today.",Awesomeuser90,2025-05-05T23:29:41,1
"The public is absolutely not in the position to discuss the law. We still have people who believe the earth is flat, or that vaccines cause autism. The public at large is stupid. It doesn’t matter how well you present legal information and arguments to them, public input will be entirely disconnected from reality.",Mend1cant,2025-05-01T19:59:32,5
"The Senate represents ""the people"".  More public input just muddies the waters where the grumblings against every choice will just become louder and wider ranging.   There's no such thing as a perfect judge.",JKlerk,2025-05-01T14:43:54,1
