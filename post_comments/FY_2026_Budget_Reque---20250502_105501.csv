Looks like many agencies and research programs will be cut. I work with the USFS on a research station and they want to cut all of our funding. They don’t want science in the way as we provide evidence and data against their policies. Please call your senators and representatives and stop these cuts!,Ready-Ad6113,2025-05-02T11:09:39,5
No. Just no. No to the whole thing.   I stopped reading at “increase money to charter schools”. If I were a representative I’d go on record as wiping my ass with this  They’re also attempting to eliminate any and all science and minority focused programs across the federal government. Take NASA for example. Increase in space exploration but then a line down nearly all funding for the science of space exploration eliminated.   Fuck this,annaleigh13,2025-05-02T15:01:40,2

"Congress has the final authority in budget allocation, but with both chambers being controlled by MAGA republicans they might pass it or something similar to it. Good time to contact your congressmen about it.",Ready-Ad6113,2025-05-02T15:42:43,1

"That’s part of the problem: my representatives don’t represent us. Thomas Massie, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell don’t give a rats ass about us, and yet keep getting elected because of how gerrymandered and uneducated the state is.",annaleigh13,2025-05-02T15:47:22,2
