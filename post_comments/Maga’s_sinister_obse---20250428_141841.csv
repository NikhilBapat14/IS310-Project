IQ tests have never meant much. Intelligence is a multidimensional thing. You can’t accurately measure it by a factor analysis and smashing of the dimensions. It’s like trying to tell me two boxes are the same size because they have the same volume.  One could be 100x1x1 and the other could be 10x10x10. Those would be vastly different but still measure the same.  Intelligence isn’t something that simple and can be broken down into linear chunks to combine to get one greatly representative number. IQ has always been a bad metric,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T14:49:50,14

IQ was never a hard science;  psychology is a soft science. There is no such thing as quantifiable intelligence. You can only really measure extreme mental deficiencies.  You’re 100% correct ,lalabera,2025-04-28T14:59:10,6
"IQ is actually one of the best tests out of psych, and while it’s true you can be good at one thing and bad at another generally speaking if you’re good at one academic field you’re good at others too (limited exceptions for savants and literal disabilities)   E.g. If you’re good at math you’re probably good at English too. Even if you consider yourself not good at English, you’re still probably better than average if you’re better than average at math.

"IQ tests are a fundamental misuse of a principal component analysis to reduce a phenomenon which shows all of the hallmarks and traits of emergence and complexity to a single dimension.  Intelligence isn’t well defined. It’s clearly a multidimensional concept. Trying to reduce it with a PCA to a single measure (the g number) is an abuse of statistics.  > People discredit ‘g’ and IQ with feels before reals but it’s got a ton of predictive validity: school grades, patents, income, life expectancy, lack of jail time, etc  People discredit g because it has been shown to be subject to creating confirmation bias in those outcomes, tests have been biased, and it isn’t a good predictor all of the time. It’s also a basic data model instead of an actual advanced algorithmic model. People tend to believe g based on feels and not actual math and science.  Intelligence is a complex phenomenon. It requires the use of methods we have that examine other complex things (e.g. consumer choices and advertising markets to target ads), or decision trees and neural networks. Using an outdated and reductive statistical method to measure something as complex as human intelligence is just bad science, and bad math.  This study:  https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00584-3  Explains it well.  Behavior factor analysis (aka principal component analysis) is a flawed method to use to analyze an emergent and complex phenomenon like intelligence.  This is why we don’t use simplistic methods like that in data science which actually has predictive power that is not constrained to confirmation bias.",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T19:22:12,5

"Interesting, but for all intents and purposes not super useful for lay persons to make that distinction.  ‘G’ is still predictive and general results still align with one another, all that study seems to show is there are distinct functional groups if you try very hard to find them that just happen to overlap significantly on any practical application.  It also doesn’t really, on my skim, discount the possibility of some sort of emergent cross domain intelligence.   But even if there is no emergent cross domain intelligence we know that intelligence is broadly correlated except fringe cases. So in the worst case scenario the ‘g’ factor is just something like a GPA, which is still a useful sort of summary… especially given the difficulty in untangling tasks from one type to the other.",Autodidact420,2025-04-29T01:50:24,1
Some perfectly cromulent words in this thread. I feel embiggened.,harsh2k5,2025-04-28T16:18:35,4
"IQ is not super useful to the layperson. It has spurious correlations and contradictory evidence against it. The use of it by laypeople is also not useful, especially since they don’t understand what it is and isn’t. It decidedly is not a measure of intelligence.  Also, a specific metric and how it’s defined isn’t a conversation to be had by lay people. It’s one that’s had by scientists.  You don’t seem to understand the implications of that study. If IQ cannot be dimensionally reduced to 1 dimension, the g number cannot be accurate as a description of intelligence.  Your dismissal of that mathematical fact is not something that can just be hand waved away.  We do not use reductive statistical methods like a PCA for phenomena as complex as intelligence because it is bad science and bad math.  > But even if there is no emergent cross domain intelligence we know that intelligence is broadly correlated except fringe cases.   Intelligence isn’t even well defined. Yet you’re using the model forcing method of statistical analysis to mold it to the data instead of a modern algorithmic method to use the data to make the model. It’s an ass backwards abuse of statistics that has been outdated for decades.  That study I posted disproves the fundamental nature of IQ as a metric to measure intelligence. You can’t just reduce complex and emergent systems to 1 dimension",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-29T01:58:59,1
