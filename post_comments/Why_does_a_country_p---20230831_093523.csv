"Countries often do keep key meetings secrets, so the premise of the question is simply incorrect.  As to why any particular meeting was not kept secret, that's a bit more complicated, and I don't know in that case.  If negotiations are done in person, it's much harder to keep secret, as the location of key diplomatic personnel and especially heads of state tend to be either public or at least well known (ie heads of state often have so much security and apparatus with them that it's hard to keep it secret if they're in another country).  NK really doesn't have the kind of supplies or industrial capacity that would make much of a difference to the Ukraine war.  So most likely publicization is to raise morale or talk up an ally.",zlefin_actual,2023-09-02T20:19:58,2
