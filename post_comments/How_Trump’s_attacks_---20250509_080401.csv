"Trump keeps calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell a “fool” and wants lower interest rates, even though the Fed is supposed to stay free from politics. Experts say if a president bends the Fed to short-term goals, it can lead to higher inflation and boom-and-bust cycles that hurt everyone.",ACSportsbooks,2025-05-09T08:04:20,9

"Well, Trump is a Russian controlled asset, and hurting every American is his appointed goal.   So anything he can do to hurt the economy, take food out of children's mouths, shred the constitution , and make money grifting while doing it, he is going to accomplish.   Plus, Trump made money using loans to buy commercial property, so the only thing he knows is ""keep interest low, equals more money for me"". He doesn't know about, or care about, the long term consequences of destabilizing the fed.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-09T08:10:22,9
