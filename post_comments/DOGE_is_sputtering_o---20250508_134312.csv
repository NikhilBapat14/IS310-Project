Conspiracy theory here but I suspect Musk hasn’t “failed”; I think his real aim was to vacuum up personal data and that he likely succeeded.,bluebird-1515,2025-05-08T13:54:58,43

Tesla is sputtering. As long as our country is under attack by DOGE... Tesla must be shut down. That is the only way Elon will feel anything.,williamgman,2025-05-08T14:11:42,7

"***From Business Insider's Bryan Metzger***:  Everywhere you look in Washington, [DOGE](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-department-of-government-efficiency) is beginning to slow down.  It's not just that [Elon Musk](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk) is preparing to [scale back his ](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-stepping-back-doge-tesla-2025-4)[involvement](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-stepping-back-doge-tesla-2025-4) in the project and devote more time to [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla). Nor is it merely that Musk's estimated $2 trillion in cuts to the federal budget have [shrunk to less than $200 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-lowers-doges-estimated-savings-again-2025-4). DOGE-related initiatives on Capitol Hill — where decisions about government spending are ultimately made — are also losing steam.  ""That's one of my big frustrations right now,"" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told BI. ""The president's DOGE agenda is all through executive orders, and not through anything else.""  A [House caucus](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-caucus) established to provide cost-cutting ideas to DOGE has had little interaction with the Trump administration. On Wednesday, a House panel created to support government efficiency efforts held a hearing on transgender athletes in fencing. And plans to vote on [making DOGE cuts permanent](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-rescissions-congress-republicans-complicated-2025-3) have stalled as well.  Despite the shock and awe of Musk's first several weeks in government, time has shown that DOGE is still subject to the laws of political gravity. Musk has [become unpopular](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-future-wisconsin-supreme-court-tesla-deliveries-numbers-2025-4), DOGE has faced [massive blowback](https://www.businessinsider.com/chuck-edwards-town-hall-asheville-north-carolina-doge-2025-3) from the public, and Tesla — the source of most of Musk's wealth — has become the [target of protests](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-showroom-design-architecture-marketing-perfect-targets-elon-musk-protests-2025-4).  The substance of Musk's project is also at risk. Though Congress has largely [taken a backseat](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-caucus-subcommittee-congress-too-fast-ideas-2025-2) to the executive branch in the initial months of [President Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump) term, the legislative branch will have to act to ensure that any changes made by DOGE aren't reversible by the next administration.

Got a source for that outrageous claim?     You can start by explaining how firing and then rehiring the same people counts as efficiency.   Then you can explain why firing park rangers is a success.  What problem did it solve?  Were we awash with too many park rangers? (Hint : no)  But sure.  Show us the math.,mjc4y,2025-05-08T16:20:41,2
">Stop...acting like everything happening has to be permanent  A ""wealth gap"" == ""Everything""?  Bit of hyperbole on your part, wouldn't you say?    Why did you mention taxation?  I didn't.  Is this YOUR remedy?  (Maybe try to use some discipline in responding to posts AS THEY ARE WRITTEN, not as you imagine them.)  If you think taxation will correct the US wealth gap, then you haven't been paying attention to actual evidence.  ""Rich and corporations"" LEAVE high-tax environments.

"You're assuming that efficiency and waste cutting was the real goal. They got unprecedented access to all sorts of sensitive data, and a number of the affected agencies were involved in actions against Leon's business interests and got hobbled. The cuts and firings were air cover in the service of political retribution and outrage generation. In that aspect, it was absolutely successful.",RobAtSGH,2025-05-08T17:11:58,2
