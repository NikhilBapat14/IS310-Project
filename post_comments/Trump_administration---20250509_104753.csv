"At this rate, I’m bracing for the next executive order: renaming Earth to “Planet Trump.” He’ll probably claim he discovered it himself, “No one knew Earth existed before me. Tremendous planet, really.”",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T10:52:12,11
Non-idiots will still call it the Persian Gulf. Same with the Gulf of Mexico.,MatrimCauthon95,2025-05-09T10:52:55,6

"This is not new. I worked in Saudi and it's always been the Arabian Gulf on that side. Persian Gulf on the other side.  This is not the same as the Gulf of America rebranding, where there is no historical precedent",perrysol,2025-05-09T11:21:43,0

Gulf of Mexico rename is stupid but at least it makes sense for him to try and rename something that we border (not that I wouldn't call it Gulf of Mexico regardless)       Persian Gulf rename is extra stupid because its all the way across the world,blues111,2025-05-09T11:17:32,3

You all realize its been called the Persian Gulf for 2500 years since the Persian Empire (500BC - 300BC).   This is all because Trump is being paid by the Saudis.  Sunni/Shia level BS.,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T11:43:12,3
"“…on that side”  They’re perfectly allowed to call it Frank if they wish to.  No need for us to rebrand everything shown on a Mercator projection, though.",Throwaway1303033042,2025-05-09T11:27:53,1
"Of course I know the history. But more recent history (I have a map published 1970s, bought in Saudi) has Arabian Gulf. If I was doing business in Saudi, Kuwait, Qatar or the UAE, I would call it that out of respect to my hosts. Nothing to do with Trump",perrysol,2025-05-09T12:39:22,1

Oh really?   You mean the United States all of a sudden supports the Saudi name?   This has nothing to do with the fact that Trump does business with the Saudis?  Well I'll be,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T12:54:59,2
"Oh, the language doesn’t offend me, simply agreeing with you that it’s ridiculous.  Whether there’s precedent on “the other side” to do so doesn’t matter.  Donny’s gonna do what Donny’s gonna do whether it makes any rational sense or not.",Throwaway1303033042,2025-05-09T11:35:37,1
The top management positions in Aramco (the largest company in Saudi) have been American since the company was founded (40s). They all called it that. It's not new.,perrysol,2025-05-09T13:39:05,1
You mean like because they depended on the Saudis.  Meanwhile being the Persian Gulf was named 2500 years ago before SA existed I’m sticking with the real answer,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T13:53:41,1
"Sure. As stated, it depends on which side of the Gulf you're on. And if you're disinterested, you go with history",perrysol,2025-05-09T14:26:51,1
