"> “We didn’t have access to lawyers or – it was just wrote up. We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too, but it was written from the heart,” Trump said afterward, describing a process driven more by impulse than mapped-out strategy.  Holy shit. That statement alone should scare the hell out of everyone on Earth. He’s like a mad king issuing proclamations without any consideration of the consequences.",dmetzcher,2025-04-10T08:57:07,1

"Treasuries were collapsing. Some hedge funds had to dump due to the carry trade volatility. Bond prices work inversely to their yields. If someone is selling a bunch of something at once, it drives down the price. Yields shot up.  Bessent has stated repeatedly that they want yields to come down. They can't pass their fat tax cuts with high yields because it makes it more expensive to borrow for deficit spending. It also makes it harder to combat a slowing economy.",pigglesthepup,2025-04-09T22:03:09,16
