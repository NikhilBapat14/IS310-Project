Not a single comment so far about the president of El Salvador dressing so casually like that? Was there even a thank you said? Why wasn't JD on this? He's out there letting trump look weak in front of other world leaders lol,Vorpalthefox,2025-04-15T23:21:27,161

"Trump is a nepo baby who grabbed several hundred million dollars from daddy Fred who was a big real estate developer who had made wiser business decisions than his crybaby narcissistic son. Donald had to declare bankruptcy [SIX times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-18/trump-business-partners-outline-his-failed-deals). In the midst of all this, Donald was able to finagle loans from big banks based more on bullshit than the banks thinking that he had merited the financial risk.   Donald's only real skill is as a con artist. The only reason gullible people think he's a business genius is that he portrayed one on a TV show.   He had been rescued by TV producer Mark Burnett who needed a relatively big name to star in The Apprentice. Donald's office in Trump Tower was so worn and ragged at that time that Burnett had to construct a new one which actually looked like a successful businessman's office.   Anybody who thinks that Trump is a stable genius probably has an economics degree from ""Trump University"".",clamorous_owle,2025-04-16T02:37:29,26

He is so weak so inconsistent in his words and deeds that the only ones who like him are the terminally gullible. I don't even hate the guy, he is a tool, used by others.
