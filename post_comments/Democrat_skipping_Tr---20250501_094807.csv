"Democrat was at a conference in South Korea and could not attend, the Republicans knew this and chose to hold the vote in his absence.   The final tally was 49-49 with a tiebreaker by VP JD Vance.   I wanted to make sure that when you're buying groceries on credit, you all know who to thank for your predicament.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-01T09:58:33,135
They almost certainly brought this to vote knowing he was going to be not in the country. Just seems like something the GOP would do.,Routine-Reaction-592,2025-05-01T10:20:18,41
"Such a non-issue.  First of all:  > Even if it did pass the Senate, the House wasn't expected to take up the resolution after Republicans passed a rule that specifically blocks this type of resolution until the end of September. Trump would also likely have vetoed the resolution if it reached his desk.  So the whole resolution was just performative.  Secondly:  > The resolution was tied after three Republicans—Senators Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski—joined Democrats in supporting the rebuke of Trump's tariffs.  So the ""controlled opposition"" on the GOP side got their go-ahead to express their concern because the leadership knew that the vote was in the bag. If Sen. Whitehouse had been there, one of those three would've joined the other Republicans, as is tradition.",Rannasha,2025-05-01T09:58:12,32
"Just ONCE I wish the media would focus on the correct angle of this story. Isn't the bigger issue here that by not doing SOMETHING to stop the irreparable damage these tariffs are causing, the Republicans are knowingly  voting against the will of their constituents and against their goddamned best interests?  Maybe they figure by the time they're up for reelection, the only constituents left to vote will be the ones with plenty of money.",JacquoRock,2025-05-01T10:27:31,18
Republicans planned the vote for when he was overseas. Vance broke the tie. They own it.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-01T10:38:23,8

"Even if this passed the Senate, the House would have immediately killed it the moment it got to their desk, because the House is loyal to Trump and Trump wants his tariffs.",Narianos,2025-05-01T13:37:38,0

What groceries? Shelves will be empty next week. Winning!,RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-01T10:17:36,11
It’s a joke anyway. It wouldn’t pass the house and Trump already said he would veto it in which case I think they need 2/3 to beat the veto.,typkrft,2025-05-01T20:11:39,0
but also why the fuck is a senator leaving the country when the rules work like this.,civil_politician,2025-05-01T14:10:48,12
"TBF, this is a political move I could see Democrats doing too. There's plenty to be upset about with modern Republicans, let's save the anger for the differences that really matter.  EDIT: LOL at all the downvoters, don't y'all have bigger issues with the Republicans, like them trying to install a king?",cliff99,2025-05-01T10:43:52,-16

And in the next sentence Newsweek called it a bipartisan measure. Do 3 senators really make it bipartisan?,epochellipse,2025-05-01T16:43:50,2
”How DARE the Democrats not stop the Republicans from punching us all in the face?!”,Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-05-01T11:27:10,9
Don’t blame the Dem. If McConnell abstained instead of voting no it’s because he knew he could given the absence of a key yes vote. It’s the Susan Collins maneuver — only vote against the party line when your vote isn’t needed.,survivor2bmaybe,2025-05-01T11:57:18,30
