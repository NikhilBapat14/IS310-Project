"One just ended one with me too. Sent me something to the tune of ‚Äúretarded dems/left will keep buying teslas anyway!

Then I went on a rant about how the republicans are ALWAYS using POCs, migrants, the left, pelosi, Biden etc to claim there‚Äôs a problem. He then called me a shitty friend and a fool and said goodbye forever. Then proceeded to bash me personally, illuminating even more reasons these people are out of their minds.",Intelligent_Burro,2025-05-02T21:15:24,156
