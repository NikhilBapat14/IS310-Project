I went the wrong way driving through that juicy underwater tunnel from Detroit to Windsor. I saw no signage telling me which direction to go and got told to park the car and go inside and answer some questions.,Wh0snwhatsit,2025-04-25T23:41:37,1

"The USA is also DEPORTING LEGAL residents of the USA.    >Ricardo Prada Vásquez, a 32-year-old Venezuelan immigrant **legally** residing in the U.S., was working as a delivery driver in January in Detroit and had picked up an order at McDonald’s when he made the wrong turn, according to the New York Times, which first published the report.

It's a clickbait title  The real reason is not because she took a wrong u turn,tedecristal,2025-04-25T11:20:18,-7
Understood. But that is not what the quotes or headline of this article are saying.,Bagofdouche1,2025-04-25T14:54:35,-1
It's not because the USA is also deporting LEGAL residents of the USA.    They are also arresting judges now.    The USA is a fascist nation.,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-25T12:11:38,8
Okay but this story is about someone who is undocumented.  Not necessarily agreeing but the title is kindve clickbait,Ryster09,2025-04-25T13:53:26,-3
"This woman is one of hundreds of people who have been arrested and deported for the crime of turning on the wrong road.  (btw the USA is also separating families, taking kids away from their parents as well)  **Legal residents** are being deported for no reason.  This is happening in the USA RIGHT NOW.

This is fascism.",ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-25T13:56:38,5
No she got arrested for trying to cross a border without papers.  I live literally right by the ambassador bridge there’s a bunch of signs saying you CANT TURN AROUND once you pass a certain point.  Do I agree with the punishment? No.,Ryster09,2025-04-25T14:02:37,-3
">No she got arrested for trying to cross a border without papers.  FALSE, she made a wrong turn, as many Americans have done before.  She was not attempting to cross a border at all.   **This is in the headline**, so you have no excuse for making this mistake.  And as you live nearby you should be aware that accidental turns onto the bridge from Americans is not uncommon.  In fact, it is so common there is a whole procedure for turning people around.  >In a statement to the Detroit Free Press Custom and Border Protection Public Affairs Chief Kristoffer Grogan says,  >*Once it is clear that outbound travel was not intended, and the vehicle is determined to be clear of contraband, motorists are escorted from the area and free to resume travel to their intended destination*  [What Happens If You Leave Michigan and Enter Canada By Mistake?](https://wkfr.com/wrong-exit-michigan-canada-accident/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral)  TO be crystal clear.

"An illegal immigrant would be “contraband” as they are, ILLEGAL.   The woman in question is not getting deported to El Salvador and is to appear in immigration court in June. Very unfortunate situation, yes. But under any administration this would happen.   Now reading it and how she was held for a week is just depressing and the treatment just isn’t right. However the deportation makes complete sense.",Ryster09,2025-04-25T14:30:19,-4
They are also deporting LEGAL residents....  Maybe read this 10 times before commenting.,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-25T15:02:38,2
"Crossing the border without documentation is a civil infraction, not a crime.  They also illegally held her daughters, who are US citizens, and tried to coerce her into signing an agreement to deport them as well.  None of what ICE and the current administration are doing helps actually resolve undocumented immigration. It is just cruelty for the sake of cruelty.  The people spreading the falsehood that undocumented immigration is a crime are doing so because they want to construct a false justification for their violence and cruelty.  Situations like this are not an 'unfortunate situation,' it is being done repeatedly, regularly, under the direction of the Trump administration. It is intentional. Multiple legal residents and US citizens have been treated the exact same way, held for weeks without due process. A Canadian woman who went to the immigration office to fix some documentation disappeared for nearly two months until it was discovered she was arrested for the very issue she came to the office to correct, and was being held in a detention facility and was never allowed to contact her lawyer, which she is *constitutionally required* to be allowed to do.  And, as you noted, people *are* being illegally sent to concentration camps in El Salvador, a literal dictatorship that has suspended effectively all civil rights and due process indefinitely. Not this woman, thankfully, but others *are*.  Just *today*, the Trump administration released a memo directing ICE agents that they can enter any home without a warrant. These are not individual agents going rogue, these abuses are the result of direction being given from the Trump administration.  We cannot be a party to this cruelty and destruction of due process.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T15:53:50,1
