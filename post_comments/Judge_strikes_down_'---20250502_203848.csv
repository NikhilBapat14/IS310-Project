"Conclusion from the Memorandum Opinion:  >The U.S. Constitution affords critical protections against Executive action like that ordered in EO 14230. Government officials, including the President, may not “subject individuals to ‘retaliatory actions’ after the fact for having engaged in protected speech.” Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 595 U.S. at 474 (quoting Nieves, 587 U.S. at 398).   >They may neither “use the power of the State  to punish or suppress disfavored expression,” Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188, nor engage in the use of “purely personal and arbitrary power,” Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 370.   >In this case, these and other foundational protections were violated by EO 14230. On that basis, this Court has found that EO 14230 violates the Constitution and is thus null and void.   >For the reasons explained, plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment and declaratory and permanent injunctive relief on Counts II through IX of the Amended Complaint. The government’s motion to dismiss is denied.",jackytheblade,2025-05-02T20:59:28,26
"Those other big law firms that sucked up (or just sucked) the president and offered millions of pro bono work to avoid having to stand up for freedom must really feel suck worthy now.  Already losing clients, losing employees, having job fairs cancelled.  Now they would have received protection from a judge.  What losers.",Cheetotiki,2025-05-02T21:47:09,16
"To be fair, a lot of what that man is attempting to do—and in many cases doing unchecked—violates the Constitution.   I’m just waiting for the rest of these fools to step up and remember this is actually *supposed* to be a democracy.",Floating_Misfit76,2025-05-02T20:57:20,23
"Trump just likes bottom of the barrel people doesn’t he? He hires all those people that really just scrapped by in their schooling, bottom of the class material.",invincibleparm,2025-05-02T22:14:24,7
Agreed.   It’s sad that my bare minimum of people for “hero status” is to simply do their job and follow their Constitutional oath.,Autoganz,2025-05-02T21:54:45,19

Following your oath to protect the constitution when it’s not under attack  and everyone else who took that oath is keeping it isn’t difficult.   It is sad that it is under attack and so many have abandoned even the concept of an oath.,specqq,2025-05-03T05:22:36,3
