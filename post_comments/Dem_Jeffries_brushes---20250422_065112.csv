"I understand that argument that now is not the time for Democrats to be fighting each other when there's a much more important force to be fighting.   But on the other hand, so many Democrats appear to be doing absolutely nothing and people are sick of it. Maybe a Tea Party-style shakeup a la the GOP \~2008 is what the DNC needs.",yourlittlebirdie,2025-04-22T06:56:15,47
"So Hakeem does have a tiny bit of fire, but only when punching down and to the left. He’s useless at defending the constitution. But give him a slightly left of center Democrat? He suddenly knows how to make a stand. ",appleandorangutan,2025-04-22T10:08:00,12

"One of the lowest approval ratings of the Democratic party ever. Not many people like you right now, Hakeem. But you're right, don't change anything, don't push back against fascism, and constantly preach centrism & bipartisanship. What's the worst that can happen?",Griffdog17,2025-04-22T07:01:45,25
"Democrats have a MASSIVE age problem that we desperately NEED to address. Aside from the obvious, that a gerontocracy is definitionally not representative of the population, we are placing ourselves at huge risk of not being able to pass what we need to pass and not being able to block what we need to block.  The 2-year mortality risk for **men and women** at ages **70, 75, 80, and 85**, based on the **Social Security Administration's (SSA) actuarial life tables** ranges from \~3% to \~22%.  There are currently 62 democratic incumbents that will be 70 years or older at the start of the January 2027 term and 5 of them will be 85 years or older at the start of the 2027 term (one, James Clyburn, in a Republican controlled state). Over 20 of the 62 live in Republican controlled states, which effects how quickly they would be replaced in the event of their death.  Thus far into the current term, two democratic representatives have already died (Sylvester Turner, aged 70 years, and Raul Grijalva, aged 77 years) and Republicans in Texas are trying their best to delay a special election to replace former Rep Turner.  These people need to step down or they need to be primaried. It doesn’t matter if it hurts their feelings or their ego, because the balance of power is a matter of life and death. We’ve already lost two Reps in the midst of the Trump presidency when we need them the most and we will almost certainly lose more in the coming months and years.  Young, smart, charismatic progressives, please stand up. Now is the time. This is your moment.",PharmPhrenzy,2025-04-22T10:26:37,3

Jeffries hasn’t appeared at all within the media for a single fight against Trump despite his significant position within the Democratic Party.   Kinda tells you all you need to know on how effective he is when it comes Democratic leadership.  David Hogg is going to save the Democratic Party and all of you better get onboard because we quite literally don’t have all that much time to save a Democracy.,Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-04-22T08:30:10,2

"This is exactly the time for infighting. The Dems have no political power at the moment, so outside of direct individual action, like what van Hollen and AOC have been doing, or sandbagging the legislative process with procedural hurdles, anything the Dems do as a party between now and the midterms is symbolic at best.   The infighting needs to happen now, so that they can coalesce around whoever comes out on top when the election cycle starts. The worst thing to do would be to show solidarity now, when it accomplishes nothing, and then start fighting amongst themselves in the lead up to the election.",_probablyryan,2025-04-22T07:32:43,13

There has to be a massive realignment in the Democratic Party to match the one that happened in the GOP.,_e75,2025-04-22T07:07:14,11
That’s because some of the incumbents have donors who actually want the tax cuts..   So most of them (excluding Bernie types) are not going to magically become useful until tax cuts get passed.,Deicide1031,2025-04-22T06:59:24,7

">I understand that argument that now is not the time for Democrats to be fighting each other  Well you shouldn't, because that's a stupid fucking argument.  The Democrat establishment is so unpopular that it has consistently been unable to beat Trump (1 for 3 with the 1 being a historically anomalous election that is (hopefully) unlikely to ever be repeated due to covid), and even the support that it did have in the 3 national elections against him was 90% ""I'll hold my nose and vote blue no matter who"" people.  Then the one time they did beat him they demonstrated that they're so captured by interest groups that they're utterly incapable of governing by doing things like watering down the CHIPS Act and the Rural Broadband Program with so much bureaucratic bullshit that they're effectively worthless.  Going further back you have Obama's signature piece of legislation being a glorified handout to the insurance companies that has sent healthcare costs skyrocketing, or Cash For Clunkers utterly decimating the used car market in the US, and establishment Democrats literally have nothing they can point to THIS CENTURY that hasn't been a total clusterfuck.  Trump shouldn't distract from the fact that these guys absolutely suck. We should do our best to throw them all out and elect candidates that better represent the American Electorate.  But instead you get 100k upvotes for Corey Booker filibustering nothing, or Nancy Pelosi ripping up a piece of paper and sarcastically clapping.  That said, David Hogg also sucks, for different reasons than the Boomer Dem establishment sucks.  Hogg is just a borderline grifter who has leveraged his status as a school shooting survivor into an unearned Harvard education and minor internet fame.  He's the left's Kyle Rittenhouse.  Dems need to be way less David Hogg and way more Ezra Klein.  This sub wants to write off Trump supporters as evil racist morons instead of realizing that they are mostly just people who, whether they know it or not, have been failed by neoliberalism/neoconservatism and are just utterly done with it.  These are the same voters who gave GOP anointed one Jeb Bush 1% in the 2015 primaries.  There are TONS of these folks who would happily jump ship if Democrats could present platforms and candidates that better reflect the economic desires of their voters.",BrannEvasion,2025-04-22T21:05:33,2

"It’s why he was picked by Pelosi in the first place, for his work against leftists.  In one of the election analysis books it describes how Biden and the Clintons have basically been putting a backdoor network of operatives into place at the federal and state level to undermine progressives but was used to undermine Obama’s push for a mini primary after the debate sent things to shit.  > > **Biden, the Clintons, and the “colored girls”—Brazile, Moore, Yolanda Caraway, and Leah Daughtry—had been working to rebuild the party infrastructure ever since Obama left office.** In particular, this reconstructed party had been fashioned with the intent of protecting Biden and, if he had not sought reelection, Harris. **In large part, it was designed to stop the party’s left wing from taking control. By helping install party loyalists at the national and state committees over the course of years, these establishment Democrats kept progressive outsiders at bay. “You know who did that?” said one Black Biden ally familiar with the maneuvering. “Bill and Hillary motherfucking Clinton.”**  > This party organ was now getting an unexpected stress test. Biden and Harris both stood to benefit if it proved resilient. But Obama was the single most influential voice among Democratic voters and donors. If Biden stepped aside, the Biden-Harris-Clinton faction would have to beat him. On tiptoes, Harris’s team had already started the race.",Kelor,2025-04-22T12:54:02,5

"Well the question is whether those candidates are actually the strongest candidates. Clearly these centrist Democrats are making *someone* happy because they did, in fact, get elected in their districts/states. Is it worth possibly losing those seats to Republicans?
