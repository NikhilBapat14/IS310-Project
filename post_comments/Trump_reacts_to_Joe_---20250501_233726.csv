That conversation is crazy.  Trump keeps backing himself further into the corner and when there’s truly nowhere to go he trots out the Biden card.,yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-02T00:27:58,169
"> Terry Moran   This conversation will be several chapters in ""The Rise and Fall of the Third America.""  He said things not just that no American President has said, but that even the worst of them would not hint at, all well being a child about the asking of questions.

">we're getting them out legally  I'm not so sure about this. Yes, he's cloaking the deportations and lack of due process under the Alien Enemies Act, but it's really not clear that this is a legal invocation of the Act. It can be invoked in times of war or when a foreign nation threatens or undertakes an invasion of America. Neither of these things have happened. Trump's framing of South American immigration as an ""invasion"" [failed to pass judicial scrutiny today](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-appointed-federal-district-judge-rejects-use-alien-enemies-act-v-rcna204150) (May 1) in a Texas federal court, of all jurisdictions.

If he's perfect, and he matters more than everyone else, everything he decides is too, so he's never the monster in his mind  Rogan is going to eat this shit up tho and use this to justify his support of Trump.

"I don't know if that's really true. It's a lot easier if you rail against the current administration, then you can rant about everything going wrong and you have zero responsibility. So the best for Rogan would be saying he supports Trump, but if Kamala actually won, then he could keep doing the exact same thing.  However as soon as the opposition guy wins, the guy you supposedly supported, now you're on the hook for everything the new administration does, so you're an apologist now for anything that goes wrong, reacting to each story as it appears rather than setting the agenda.  It's just far easier to be against stuff in some vague way, when you're not required to provide any answers, or defend what's happening.",cipheron,2025-05-02T00:04:35,25

This. So much of MAGA fervor is kind of baked into this oppositional rage. Which is why so many of them resort to Biden or even Obama critiques when you try to have an actual conversation about what’s happening.

I think Joe has changed a ton since those days though for various reasons. He falls for shit like your parents would on Facebook   COVID also completely changed him and there are some legitimate reasons for it. Like I can kind of understand him being fed up with CNN acting like he was legit taking horse dewormer and not the human grade equivalent. I definitely disagree with him on a ton of COVID related stuff but the media really did their best to misrepresent him   Not saying he was ever some sort of super genius or anything but he at least seemed to make some sort of attempt to understand stuff and now it feels like he just takes the word of people he knows without remotely trying to see if it's true. If Jamie was actually allowed to fact check him live these days it would be so many times during each episode,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-02T10:55:28,1
