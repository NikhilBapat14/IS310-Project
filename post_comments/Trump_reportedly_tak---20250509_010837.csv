"I asked because the fact that Americans seem to think there are duties for the president‚Äôs spouse to perform. It is bizarre, and somewhat misogynistic. Would you assume a president‚Äôs husband would be in charge of decorations?",Betterthanbeer,2025-05-09T06:21:33,3

"I didn‚Äôt say why you asked. Rather, I said I didn‚Äôt know why you would think  the spouse‚Äôs duties would be in the Constitution.
