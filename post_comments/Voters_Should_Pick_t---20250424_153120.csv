We need nationwide ranked choice voting.. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-24T15:35:01,25
"Yeah, because clearly, voters are SO smart.",brak771,2025-04-24T16:06:00,7
"Unfortunately that's how the GOP got Trump.   Party primary elections suck. Low turnout, mostly the most extreme voters are most motivated to come. Jungle primaries where the top two candidates of any party are selected might be marginally better but it hasn't really played out that way. Ranked choice voting would be better than either.",AccomplishedDust3,2025-04-24T15:42:00,27
Then voters need to actually *fucking participate*.,LordSiravant,2025-04-24T16:46:49,6
It’s called a primary.  And people need to vote for it to work well.  Many do not vote because they feel that their vote does not count because of the electoral college system.  Let’s go after that system first.,barfbutler,2025-04-24T17:36:31,3
"It's funny watching the same exact people who've been falsely accusing the DNC of picking candidates now defend Hogg for literally wanting to pick candidates.  Ken Martin (who actually earned his position, unlike Hogg) is right here, letting party bosses do this will slowly turn us into Tammany Hall.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-04-24T16:22:54,3
"You can be more involved if you’re registered to a party. At least in NY.   I go to my party’s caucus’ every year where those who want to be candidates, and have enough signatures from other party members, gives a little talk to the assembled group and afterwards we vote on who gets the nomination.",FindtheFunBrother,2025-04-24T15:52:14,2
Wow. The Dems are in worse shape than imagined.   This dude is nothing but status quo.   He’s just a mouthpiece for the party elders.   David Hogg is getting kneecapped by his own boss,shakergeek,2025-04-24T20:00:49,2
"After the GOP was hijacked twice by Trump, I actually think that party bosses should pick their candidates.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-24T15:54:03,4
From DNC Chair Ken Martin,NorthHaverbrookNate,2025-04-24T15:32:05,2
The parties are private organizations and need to stay that way. They’re already too firmly entwined with our electoral system.,Logical_Hare,2025-04-24T17:11:18,1
"They do.  The problem is voters don't often turn out.  While 60% might be a near record for a Presidential election it's still disgustingly low.  Primaries are even worse.  I live in OR one of the highest voter turn out states in the country (because we're all mail in ballots) and primary turnout is anywhere between about 35-50% and I'd wager upwards of 2/3-3/4 of that are people over 40.  You won't get representation you want unless you vote, every election, every year, and some times it takes a LOT of elections to win.",atreeismissing,2025-04-25T00:01:41,1
I like the people that propose the top 4 or top 5 version of IRV that Alaska uses.  That does limit ballot size.,Uhhh_what555476384,2025-04-24T18:48:28,2
"Honestly, a more simple solution could be a law school degree and at least 4 years of elected office as a requirement for Presidency.  We could also throw in a “constitutional test” in there.  Or ranked voting and keep voting for TV stars…",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-24T16:26:59,0
Jungle primaries have largely blocked the crazies from taking over WA 4th CD.,Uhhh_what555476384,2025-04-24T18:47:19,6
"“Unfortunately that’s how the GOP got a well-liked, winning candidate”. Democrats will do literally anything but change.",Throwaway98796895975,2025-04-24T23:17:07,-2
People wanted Biden. He wasn't even on the NH Primary and he still won it. When he stepped out of the race we got his Designated Successor. I still don't understand what people's problem with that was.,JakeConhale,2025-04-24T21:44:19,3
"Allowing healthy primary challenges isn't ""picking"", and a safe blue House primary is certainly different than a Presidential one.   Competent leaders have nothing to worry about. The party has an image problem and this will help fix it.",wdymxoxo69420,2025-04-24T17:34:37,2
"It's not funny. It's hypocritical. Just have to explain it to people.  >The Democratic National Committee is cracking down on gun control advocate and DNC vice chair David Hogg’s plans to spend millions primarying incumbents in safe seats that he deems “ineffective.”  >Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin will call for DNC officials’ neutrality to be codified in the party’s official rules and bylaws, two Democratic sources tell CNN. Martin has already been telling DNC members of his plans and will explain more in a call with members Thursday afternoon.",tech57,2025-04-24T17:13:34,1
"This is the way it works in Parliamentary systems, and is honestly why I am open to that system. Low-information voters are very vulnerable to populism, and Trump is a perfect example of that.",iusedtobekewl,2025-04-24T16:58:15,3
"This is also why the founders came up with the Electoral College.   That also hasn't turned out so well, but it's clear they saw a danger from a Trump-like candidate except the country has made several moves since then to make it more likely until it did in fact happen.",AccomplishedDust3,2025-04-24T15:59:16,2
It's gonna be really funny watching everyone bashing democrats in the response to this that don't even bother to check who wrote it.,obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-24T15:42:43,2
"No, the DNC were definitely controlling the outcome in many US states. Not to mention the introduction of super delegates and everything else.",Chronotaru,2025-04-25T05:42:07,1
First part is dumb. Second is better,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-24T17:41:51,10
So a wealthy lawyer is the only person who has any shot of holding the highest office. I’m sure that’ll be great for the working class,iplaybassok89,2025-04-24T17:15:09,8
"Cool, not a story I know I'll have to read up.",AccomplishedDust3,2025-04-24T19:36:13,1
It's how the GOP got a populist candidate that entirely dismantled their party and now holds their elected officials hostage for fear of a primary challenge.,AccomplishedDust3,2025-04-25T07:40:44,1
So wasting millions of dollars that could be used to fight the gop? Great idea…,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-04-24T22:06:56,1
"The electors were originally supposed to be able to reject people they didn't think would be fit for the presidency, even if they won an election and pick someone else. That whole system was dismantled by the political parties by pushing state laws that prevented electors from exercising their duty to protect the republic from mad or incapable presidents.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-24T16:11:39,3
"It's also funny to me to see people here say that the party's leaders should be the ones who decide who the candidate is. This is after I've seen comments about Sanders being treated unfairly in comparison to Hilary back in 2016. Additionally, one of the biggest complaints about Kamala was the whole ""the voters did not get to choose"" schtick.",crimsonfang1729,2025-04-24T16:15:12,3

"Yeah why would the DNC want a popular left wing candidate who wins elections and keeps the party in line. What a truly terrible evil terrible outcome. No, the best path to the future is to continue to nominate center right, wealthy neoliberals with no positions beyond “keep everything the exact same as it’s always been”",Throwaway98796895975,2025-04-25T07:41:43,1
"The original electors were just to purely pick the President on their own, there wasn't any public vote for President at all. No one was supposed to ""run for president"", you vote for someone locally who you think will pick a good president, then they all get together and decide.",AccomplishedDust3,2025-04-24T16:17:43,2
"Those were both just excuses for them not to vote for a woman. Trump ran for president three times, he he won twice against women, lost once against a man. Progressives found every excuse they could not to elect the first female president of the United States.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-24T17:12:15,3
I feel like a test on the constitution doesn’t actually correlate with someone’s willingness to not break it? Like this maybe functions as a “can you pass a basic exam after preparing for it” cognitive test but I think you can imagine someone like trump turning this into a “do you think I have the constitutional right to be a dictator” test.,Jakemcclure123,2025-04-25T10:34:12,2
"FDR: passed the bar at Columbia but dropped out of law school  Truman: sold insurance, farmer   LBJ: Taught school    Probably the three best modern presidents for the working class.

"I see it like an adoption fee for animals. There’s plenty of animals that need homes, but the money is meant to make sure you’re capable of taking care of them.
