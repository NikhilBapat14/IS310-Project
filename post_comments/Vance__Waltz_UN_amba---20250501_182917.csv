"It sure is. He went from having a job with actual responsibilities to a position that's essentially a figurehead. Ambassadors basically just host parties while their staff does the real diplomatic work. That's why you see complete nobodies with no diplomatic experience being granted ambassadorships, and this happens under both GOP and Dem presidents. It's a cushy position to reward friends/family/donors.  Although, hilariously, Trump and the MAGA crew have talked extensively about leaving the UN, and organization they have zero respect for. So it makes sense that they'd appoint a complete fuckup to the position, hoping that he fucks it up more.",mediocre_remnants,2025-05-01T18:37:28,3
They lie about little things. They lie about big things. They lie and they lie and they lie and they lie some more. The only constant is the lying.  Their contempt for the public is breathtaking.,bin10pac,2025-05-01T18:54:24,2
