I blame Jill Biden for everything. He needs to disappear and enjoy his retirement instead of embarrassing public appearances.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-17T16:35:25,22
"""Ice cream has been shown to have a calming effect on patients with dementia. One reason why does ice cream help with dementia is that it serves as a positive distraction. Many people have positive emotions associated with ice cream, as it’s often seen as a treat or reward. When a patient with dementia is feeling frustrated or upset, offering them ice cream can help to shift their focus to the positive experience of eating the treat.  Another reason why does ice cream help with dementia may help with dementia is that it stimulates the production of “feel-good” chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin and dopamine. These chemicals can help to improve mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.""    https://luxseniorcare.com/why-does-ice-cream-help-with-dementia/",Ironman650,2025-04-17T14:47:37,34
"Man, Biden continues to deliver the lulz - Dropped icecream AND conflating Ukraine with Iraq. Sharp as a tack my ass.  And pray tell, why are those pro-Palestinian dipshits protesting against him at this point? They do understand he's out of office, right? Or is that too much to expect from these cretins?",WPWeasel,2025-04-17T14:56:03,20

He probably needs to be spoon fed at this point.,sweet_greggo,2025-04-17T15:46:48,2
joey no-scoops.  it's pretty wild that this guy was president less than 100 days ago.,reaper527,2025-04-17T17:32:45,2
I give up.  Do you guys really think the deep state won't go in hiding and play along just long enough to bs court and the Dem cult of vote for all or none to ever fix the country.  It was doomed years ago.  All manipulation.  Nothing matters anymore. So glad my chick is from the Philippines.  She can own land.  Gonna be peace out boy scout in the next election of AOC 😂,scram007-3,2025-04-17T18:22:33,1
