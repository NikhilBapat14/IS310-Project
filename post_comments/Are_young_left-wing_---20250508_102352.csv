I'm lefty myself & would be over the moon for candidates I could feel good voting for, but the absolute last thing I'd ever want to do IRL is get in a whole room of lefties & tell them they were wrong about **anything** or should do anything different.  Culturally it's our biggest & deepest problem, we aren't open to uncomfortable or challenging ideas, much less uncomfortable & challenging truths. That means we can't really debate any issue in good faith, course correct or end up with good evidence based policy.  When lefties hear something they don't like they attack the person speaking. They question their character & question if they even have a right to an opinion because of identity politics. In practice this means you can only preach to the choir & never bring in new people or new ideas.  I really cannot blame young people for giving up on the party, I just wish they were leaving it for something better. MAGA gets a lot of support & votes not with good policy or good solutions, but just by being able to point out & distance themselves obvious dysfunction & craziness.",mule_roany_mare,2025-05-08T22:49:39,48

The American left is largely losing the young. Yes it still has some support and they are largely the stereotypes you expect but most of the leftist protest look more like the elderly waiting for a bus.

"Every question you have asked I ask myself and I’m early 30’s in the American Midwest. I consider myself very progressive and a leftist and I have no idea... I have attended monthly or bi monthly protests since February and I am seeing punks at protests (1980’s Reagan era punk music folks) but they are older than me now, I’m seeing plenty of grey hairs in scooters, and plenty of peers but not youngins.   I genuinely worry giving a shit is “cringe” now because I may not have inherited my father’s nationalism, but I did inherit his love of country for good or ill. Youngins know the context thanks to (current) public education (which isn’t perfect obviously and my only education),and from what I can tell they have two options socially. They can either lean into the nihilism and self aggrandizement of social media, or double down on more selfless human interaction in a society where that quality and skill is on the decline.   Ugh sorry I ranted on my stuff, I hope someone can take the mantle politically speaking. The corruption is so out in the open now, most level headed good hearted people avoid it even if they mean well.

"No they are not active in real life. They espouse the affluent liberal opinions online because there's an aesthetic to having the correct opinion but that's where the political interests end.  I'm in a red state. In my life-time I've heard dozens of right wingers speak up in public or in mixed company - like at work - about politics and I've never heard a liberal speak up once. Not one time.  Right wingers feel very comfortable speaking about politics publicly whereas liberals avoid it. Libs know the onus will fall on them to have answers and to explain everything happening to the nth degree whereas conservatives never expect pushback and are never accountable to the details of what they claim.  Dems can counter this by tapping more argumentative and combative type people - people less concerns with a pristine image, who're more interested in being right than being friendly.",hotpajamas,2025-05-08T21:03:52,14

"I’m not a democrat but from what I’ve seen, not much. I come from a predominantly liberal university. The majority of them posted on the internet and thought that was enough. Our school got rid of DEI. There was supposed to be a protest. Almost no one showed up. Mind you, they make their politics their whole personality, cut people out of their lives for not being with them 100% on every issue, put their causes in their instagram bios, but they won’t do anything beyond that.  My personal theory is that there’s a few reasons for this: the candidates they really want aren’t winning the elections (Bernie Sanders) so there’s discouragement among them, some are protesting from a place of comfort and thus won’t actually make sacrifices aside from ten-year friendships and family ties (however that’s blamed on the other person), and the fact that many of them believe in excommunication rather than communication. If you believe anyone with the wrong beliefs will never change and needs to be cut off from society, why try to teach others or rally support? The loudest activists for the Democrats pretty much believe that they don’t need to increase their support, the need to get rid (not decrease) the other sides support.

"That's the thing.  If people want to change the Democratic party, they need to get involved in primaries.  Primaries for congress, governor, state and local offices are all very low turnout affairs.  A relatively small number of young people could absolutely upset a geriatric incumbent.  This has happened!  This is how AOC came to office.  There are people out there who don't just talk the talk but walk the walk, and I have an enormous amount of respect for AOC and others like her.  The ideal way to create change is to push for better nominees in primaries, and then support the democrat in the general election, even if you don't like the nominee, because the alternative is fascism.  The people who ignore primary elections and then complain, sit out, or vote third party when they don't like the nominees or their policies are doing both themselves and their country a disservice.",icefire9,2025-05-08T21:00:52,4
"Don't confuse apathy and/or shitposting/memes by younger Americans with their complete lack of free time or mobility. Everyone is working, often two jobs, to afford a bedroom in their parent's basement.   This is a big reason why we saw so many college protests and successful boycotts vs street marches and general strikes; the former we can afford to do, the latter we cannot.   Until we lose enough that making a car payment, health care premiums, and rent are no longer worth doing, that won't change.

"I’m a young person in America and first I’d to say that we’ve been so totally fucked over by student loan debt that many can hardly afford to take a day off to protest for the Democrats just to have them concede in the name of bipartisanship. This country hates its youth and is a deeply conservative, anti-intellectual, individualistic, and backwards nation.  Part of the reason is because Americans do not have third places, adults have work and home, plus whatever small businesses or shop/commercial enterprises they prefer. Young people have no options to socialize outside of school that doesn’t cost money or isn’t immediately hostile to youth (for good reason). This means the only place for discourse in the Internet, which is controlled by media corporations and tech companies who intentionally keep people in an echo chamber or constantly outraged because that drives engagement.   Then you add in the failure of Democrats to create a unified left wing, because they’re constantly sabotaging young progressives. It should be no mystery young people are more apathetic (which is not the case, if anything we’re becoming more radical).  I live in a red state, I’m 25, communist, and I’ve tried correcting coworkers on the facts of republican policy, Covid, you name it. And each and every time they devolve to yelling and denigrating either me or my reasoning. So what’s the point? My state’s a one-party show, a laboratory for the worst republican policy and federal dems seem content to allow that as long they keep their seats.

"American youth have been protesting Israel on college campuses for a year and a half now.

Kamala Harris didn't even win her own party's primary and she still got more than 40% of the vote in the general.  Elected Democrats, incapable of being dislodged by primaries, are also unwilling and incapable of doing their jobs. When they're in power, they have the unelected Senate parliamentarian kill a minimum wage bill.

"You're confused because based on your own posting history your own viewpoints are a bit unique even to where you live.  The world isn't a simple struggle between ""left"" vs ""right"" or any other absolutist construct you might want to use, it's more of a balancing act between many different competing and even contradictory concerns.    As for young Americans, while they still favored Harris in the 2024 election cycle as a whole they also as a demographic represented the largest shift towards Trump.  Some will argue that's because the 2024 turnout was lower than 2020 and that is true, but the 2020 cycle was not a regular election cycle as far as turnout.  Not all, but many of the people running around declaring democracy is dead or declining in the United States are older (think over 55).

Most younger people still want democracy but they don't want whatever the democratic party has been selling since the Clinton era. Democrats have to an extent relied heavily on being the lesser of two evils and taking younger people for granted.  I do think there are incentives stacked in favor of superficial engagement in politics over more concrete participation as well, and that many young people choose the former over the latter, but it just doesn't explain why the democratic party is the way it is in my view.",Havenkeld,2025-05-09T10:05:18,1
"All these people saying ""no"" are dead wrong. Young left-wing Americans, especially college students and graduate students, are extremely politically active. They're just not active around the same issues older liberals are.  There's a deep divide between older liberals and young leftists. Older liberals have been particularly galvanized by opposition to Trump specifically and by right-wing attacks on women's rights. Young leftists have been most active around Palestine, labor, and climate issues. Liberals tend to be hostile to leftists' pro-Palestine activism, and leftists tend to be scornful of liberals' narrow focus on Trump (seeing him instead as a symptom of late capitalism, institutional rot, a corrupt two-party system, etc.). There's also a lot of bitterness between Clinton/Harris supporters who believe leftists undermined their candidates and Sanders supporters who believe liberals conspired against theirs.  The new regime's brazen violations of civil rights, especially directed at pro-Palestine activists, has created something of a bridge between the two groups. But Palestine is still a major wedge.",no_one_canoe,2025-05-09T11:59:54,1
"County level Democratic Party chairs tend to be retirees that do everything possible to find younger versions of themselves to do all the organizing work, but who won’t disrupt the party machine. National level party leaders raise money from donors, then put pressure on the state and county level leaders to find organizers to promote the DNC’s donor approved platform. It’s important to make sure younger people don’t want to contribute anything new on their own. It’s the polar opposite of grassroots activism. It’s entirely top down and authoritarian.   If someone tries to start their own independent activist group, the party chairs do everything possible to get someone to add them to the group chat. They offer helpful suggestions, get the word out about events, etc. But they also try to subtly steer the agenda. And if needed, they’ll overtly steer the agenda, set up competing events, form new chat groups with everyone besides the “troublemakers,” etc.  The events they schedule are more focused on people holding up Democratic Party printed signs to communicate with strangers about how much they hate Trump. But the organizers try to limit how much protesters are able to speak with each other to keep them from getting too many ideas. Then when the original activists lose steam, they chalk that up as a win. Motivating the right people is just as important to them as demotivating the wrong people.  After 15 years of Citizens United, the Democratic Party is completely hollow. It’s a marketing apparatus for special interest groups, not a place for regular people to organize. Nobody wants to do anything anymore. Ironically that includes the party chairs. They know what they’re doing is wrong, but it’s impossible to stand up to the party machine. Actual activism is fun and motivating. You’re standing up for something you actually believe in. Promoting the DNC’s marketing message is more exhausting and less honorable than spinning a sign advertising a pizza place.   If a political party is willing to accept bribes to fund the genocide of countless small children, it’s pretty obvious they’re taking bribes to look the other way on lesser white collar crimes like fraud and tax evasion as well. As such, the American public has turned its back on them. Democratic Party officials are as hated as the former heads of the National Rifle Association, Black Lives Matter, the United Auto Workers, etc. The leaders of these once prominent groups were caught stealing from their own members. Whenever people called them out, they tried to say it was from a political critic. All of them were fined and/or imprisoned.

"Younger people are definitely underrepresented, but to say there isn’t a single young person is just incorrect. I live in a smaller city (30k people) in Indiana and while yes, the majority of active people are older, that’s not completely the case. Our county democratic committee has 3/4 of its leadership under 50. At meetings, there are fewer younger people showing up, but that’s because it’s at 7 on a Thursday. Younger people have little kids that are more demanding and have bedtime, older kids with activities, or are young and work irregular shifts or maybe want to hang out with their friends.   Now, yes, the Democratic Party absolutely has an issue with embracing youth… but we also have to recognize why young people aren’t able to show up. I think one thing people don’t recognize is what kind of younger person embraces Republican vs democratic values. Younger republicans tend to have more family ties, more access to wealth, and more race/gender privilege. On the flip side, a lot of people who lean left (I’m talking about your average Joe, not politicians) either have had more struggles themselves or are connected to people who have. They are more often neurodivergent or tied to the LGBTQ+ community. And because of that, don’t have the money/flexibility to show up.

"Well, less than half the population voted to begin with (about 43% of the total, about 65% of eligible voters). Lots of people are disenfranchised—children under 18, of course, but also millions of people who've lost their voting rights because of criminal convictions and more than 10 million undocumented people—and then about a quarter of the eligible population isn't registered. The number of people who actually should have been able to vote but didn't is ""only"" about 19 million. It's a lot (way more than enough to be decisive in such a close election), and it's unfortunate, but bear in mind that there are a lot of policies of *de facto* disenfranchisement that obstructed those people's voting rights, as well as policies that contribute to 25% of the eligible population not being registered.  Millions of people (disproportionately Black and Latino) were unjustly purged from voter rolls. Polling places were shuttered. Mail-in ballots were rejected (again in ways that disproportionately affected nonwhite voters). Young people are more likely than older ones to be caught by these voter-suppression efforts, both because young Americans are less likely to be white than older ones and because, let's be honest, young people tend to be less organized. If your state passes a law that says you have to register at least 12 months in advance, or that if you're working all day on Election Day you can opt for early voting but you have to request it five months in advance, who's more likely to miss those deadlines, a 60-something retiree or a 19-year-old? *Registered* young voters actually turn out at a very high rate. Young people are just less likely than others to be registered.  All that said, yeah, only about 25% of Americans under 30 voted for Harris (47% turnout, 54% for Harris). It wasn't an across-the-board phenomenon, though. The two decisive shifts toward Trump came from 1) young men and 2) Latinos, especially men, and especially…yep, young men. It's hard to know how much of that is just baseline misogyny and how much is the influence of social media brainrot (Joe Rogan, Andrew Tate, Jordan Peterson, and other predators and dimwits of their ilk), but it's a huge problem.  It tracks with my general observations about left-wing activism here, too. Universities are the major focal points of youth activism, and men have less and less of a presence on campuses. Fewer than 40% of American undergrads last year were male. Barely a third of American grad students were male.

"I think so. And in more recent years, when young people were encouraged (re the Obama campaign), they poured out in groves. I know I’m about to conflate two issues - young voters vs young people in politics but track with me for a bit.   Young people have always struggled to be involved in politics because let’s be real, politics is complicated and power is siphoned and hoarded away by mid-career snd older statesmen and women. Younger leaders are special birds, once-in-a-generation talents (Kennedy, Obama, etc) that are granted unique opportunities to lead and that’s what young people see as who and how they have to be to be worthy to succeed in their industry.   There are no limits to how old you can be in politics but there are limits and an overt snide disdain for younger politicians who are told they don’t have enough life experience to deserve a seat at the table — mind you many of the older people at the table have done _nothing_ else in their life but politics.   The last 3 election cycles really hurt the morale of the youth. It was already low to begin with, but older statesmen have made it clear that power belongs to them and younger voters and officials don’t even get the opportunities. AOC is the quintessential rising star in her own party and they attempt to snuff out her influence every chance they get — younger voters see that, young people in politics see that. It’s demoralizing and what’s worse is now there’s this trend that dinosaurs in politics no longer need to resign with dignity but are granted permission to die of old age in office.

"But it's worth thinking about this as a balancing act. Sure, you're right. Increasing turnout of a voting demographic that skews in your favor will help you. It will also help your opponent--no party is perfect, they will always turn out voters that oppose them when trying to turn out their own.   The question then becomes, can you turn those people out for a large enough gain that it isn't canceled out by increased turnout of opponents in the same group. The math becomes harder if you lose voters (to an opponent or demobilization) in other groups because of what you do to mobilize the group you're focusing on.   Dems can do more to win over younger voters. Sure, that is true. At the same time, they cannot change the fact that when it comes to voter reliability and issue priorities, the most reliable blocks of voters prioritize issues differently than young voters. That's a problem running deeper than any particular issue, because it means Dems get locked into positions that either alienate some people by hewing too closely to one group or alienate voters in multiple groups by standing on ground somewhere between them that everyone dislikes.",Emergency_Streets,2025-05-09T07:46:46,6
I think the vast majority of young people are normies who just want more money for themselves (including the ones who think saying so is beneath them). They largely don’t have serious moral convictions. Winning those voters is the same as winning the median voter.,friedgoldfishsticks,2025-05-09T05:45:21,2

Confusing technocratic means tested programs like Harris ""loan for up to a certain amount for first generation home buyers who paid a certain amount of rent on time for 2 years"" just are not resonating with the average young person.

"I mean, it's simply vastly more complex than that.  Imagine if the entire EU had a 'left party' and a 'right party' and those parties had centralized leadership that was meant to represent all 450 million of you. Tell me, what policies does the 'average' person left of center in the EU support? They support a progressive tax system? How progressive? How is it implemented? How do you go about finding that out?  Oh, you say-- well that's what the primaries are for. Fair enough. So who gets financial support to make a viable primary run? Remember, your candidate is running ads from Spain to Norway. There's a lot of travel involved, too-- a lot of people to meet, a lot of polling and focus groups to run across a diverse voting constituency. You have to have a huge staff if you have any hope of  engaging hundreds of millions of people. It's not cheap.  Luckily, we have that two-party system, so many of the political resources are being directed back into a centralized place to be distributed to the most viable candidates.  But wait, how do you know who is the most viable candidate? I guess the party leadership will have to pick a handful of people that they think are the most viable. How do they know who is most viable? Unfortunately no one has a magic ball to help them understand precisely what candidate will appeal to the most voters. I guess they have to use their judgement based on the evidence they have. Luckily, humans are entirely rational beings, so this system works fine and doesn't disenfranchise anyone or lead to any infighting.",allhailthehale,2025-05-09T09:24:56,4
"I agree with you there. You can be frustrated with young people, any group of voters for that matter, but you can not ignore them. That's not how politics in the U.S. work.    At the same time, I wonder whether some of this will be solved by the rise of a new goal or shared priority. When Obama was around, he was the shared goal for most Dems. Trump is that for Republicans now. Biden wasn't ideal, but the shared goal in 2020 was stopping Trump, but that didn't seem as important in 2024 since he was out of office.   Maybe we'll see something like that emerge, maybe we won't.

"Pretty sure the Democrats do a lot of research to find out who are viable candidates. They desperately want to win the election, don’t they? They consider the voter base carefully. The voter base is mainly the older generation. So they don’t take any risks. The republicans took a huge risk going with Trump. They transformed their own party without much concern for the moderate conservatives. Did that shift come from above or below? Democracy isn’t a spectator sport, nor is it a good way of getting exactly what you want. It’s simply the best alternative. And didn’t Kamala raise five times as much money as Trump?

"Exactly. The problem is the voter base. If you get more young people into the voter base, that voter base will change. Do you understand that?
