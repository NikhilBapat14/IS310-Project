"Currently, sodomy is the name of a sex crime in some jurisdictions. This is distinct from the sex acts at issue in Lawrence because the act currently criminalized are non-consensual.",Blear,2022-08-19T08:05:19,21
"The laws you’re referring to prohibited *consensual* sodomy (oral and anal sex). It’s uncommon to refer to those forms of sex, when consensual as “sodomy” in English due to the negative connotations of the word. Every state, however, has laws against non-consensual oral and anal sex and in some states (such as Oregon) those laws specifically use the word “Sodomy.”",Anything-Complex,2022-08-19T10:49:45,6
"Crime names vary by jurisdiction, but there are several factors at play.   1.	 Plenty of states have sodomy laws still on the books. Repealing a law takes political capital, so legislators don’t want to waste capital on repealing a law that’s been overturned.  2.	 Prosecutors sometimes use sodomy laws as another charge to throw at defendants in sexual assault cases.  3.	 In some states, rape is still a man penetrating a woman without consent. So aggravated sodomy (which has the same penalties) is the name of one of the other crimes used to prosecute what we colloquially refer to as rape.  I assume point 3 is why the term is in your materials.",gsfgf,2022-08-19T09:09:59,6
"I can tell you that in Texas we still have Sodomy laws on the books, even if they are completely unenforced. I suspect it comes down to 'political capital' for the politicians in the State. Everybody on both sides of the aisle understands it's not enforceable, so why would they waste the time and energy getting it removed from the code (D)/ attempt to use it and struck down by the courts if you tried to enforce it(R) when those same politicians can focus on something that has real impact?",FranklySinatra,2022-08-19T08:33:35,2
"I'm sure there are plenty of laws in plenty of states that still use the term ""sodomy"" and say that it is illegal.  Lawrence v. Texas just made the enforcement of those laws unconstitutional, but that doesn't automatically repeal them from the state statutes.  It would be unconstitutional to ENFORCE them because of Lawrence, but unless a state legislature takes action to repeal the sodomy law, it remains on the books.  Just like lots of abortion laws remained on the books after Roe v. Wade was decided.",phreeeman,2022-08-19T12:21:27,2
"I know the UCMJ distinguishes between them. The reason is a technical difference in definition, rape being PIV only and sodomy constituting penetration of any orifice other than PIV. Afaik after Don't Ask Don't Tell, sodomy is only defined as criminal if it's ""forced"" or otherwise nonconsensual, as someone else mentioned.  Also afaik those two terms are meant to be separate charges from a generalized ""sexual assault"" so as to create tiers of severity with commensurate punishments.  Apologies if any of this is out of date, it's been a while since the military.",theRuathan,2022-08-19T16:15:06,1
"Sodom still has the same definition, it's just legal now.",JohnOliverismysexgod,2022-08-19T17:08:06,0

Not sure why you’re downvoted. It is a recent change and took far longer than Lawrence to put into regulations. It used to include things like willing fraternal civilian and enemy interactions too but now is strictly without consent.,[deleted],2022-08-20T15:03:20,2
"In the context that it's being used in this training, it is clear that it is considered non-consensual and illegal. I just found it odd that a word like that still exists in the legal parlance of a state like California",loselyconscious,2022-08-19T20:27:33,1
