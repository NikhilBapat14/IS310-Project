"Its not really playing both sides, but rather competing priorities overlapping and attempting to accomplish all of them at the same time.  The US and Israel are [major non-NATO ally](https://www.state.gov/major-non-nato-ally-status/) (as is Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan, and Kuwait in the same region).  As others have probably said regarding Ukraine as well, [giving the arms and weapons to these countries allows us to replace them with newer tech](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62002218) and many times the financial aid given for [weapons is immediately spent back in the US for weapons](https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/04/how-will-ukraine-spend-its-new-us-aid/396012/).  Given Israel's response to the Hamas attack, its a natural implication that the US would be giving weapons and funds that would be used to attack Hamas.  But another priority of the US is that we like to give charity and help others in the world.  The current foreign aid in Biden's [proposed budget](https://www.usaid.gov/cj) (which will never be passed but that's another entire discussion) is [over $50 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Allocation) and through 24 agencies listed at that link.  This does not include NGO and charities here that also attempt to use their resources to fix the ""problems"" they see across the nation and world.  (I use the term ""problem"" like that because different political viewpoints might disagree whether it really is one or so).  Helping the people impacted by Hamas and Israel (whatever term you want to use or not use) is high up in the priorities for a lot of people and our governmental agencies.  So while it might seem confusing, its really just multiple groups trying to do what they think is best.",AuditorTux,2024-05-25T14:20:11,3
"This link will provide essential and need to know context that almost always gets overlooked.   https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/strait-hormuz-worlds-most-important-oil-artery-2023-10-20/  It is also important to be aware that the United States has been planning to help with a coup attempt in Iran for over two decades. The progressive secular population of Iran does not like their Islamic religious oppressors who rule over them. This other link will also provide essential need to know information related to that. Israel always needs to be fully stocked because a full blown war with Iran is always right around the corner.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict  Essentially there is a cold war occurring and the United States is on the side of Saudi Arabia, vying for control over the entire middle east. If you listen to state department press briefings, Biden is saying that the creation of a Palestinian state is being negotiated as being part of a Saudi and American bilateral agreement. One of the main reasons for October 7th was to prevent normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia which have been put on hold.   The United States can't abandon Israel over something as insignificant as Palestinian or humanitarian reasons, control over that strait, impending war with Iran, our intelligence alliances, Israel's defense agreements, all matter so much more.   When it comes to international relations, you have to understand that every government is trying to advance the interests of its people by controlling resources, shipping lanes, global financial/lending institutions, and ngos as much as they can. The prices of our goods like our gas is dependent on global supply chains that are only as free as they are because of American security guarantees.   Since the United States can't abandon Israel and is working on a Palestinian state, the United States needs to make sure there is no famine and that our buddies are not stepping out of line because that will harm our diplomatic and national security goals. Creating that pier works to address the famine concerns. Biden is making good faith efforts to create a Palestinian state out of all this. Google, ""Saudi Arabia Biden State Department Palestinian state"". The American government doesn't have an issue with Palestinian civilians, we have issues with the Iranian backed Hamas, Houthis, and Hezbollah that are all attacking Israel.   I hope this gives you a good spring board for understanding the complexities of America's maneuvering. If you have any questions feel free to ask.",InquiringAmerican,2024-05-30T01:20:14,2
"The short answer is that Israel is our only ally in the region, so being able to have military bases in the area is easier than being locked out. We send aid to Palestine mostly for optics. The country wants aid to Palestine, so we provide it. It buys votes.",Volkrisse,2024-05-29T10:08:38,1
We know the money and weapons are getting to Israel. We also know that almost none of US aid is getting Gaza. And the real kicker is because Israel won’t let it through! US politics are absolutely BS and I have never wanted to leave this country more than in 2024. Our politicians are disgraceful and it should be criminal to allow donations to candidates by lobbyist groups (AIPAC AND NRA in particular),Rivhockey,2024-08-17T15:32:22,1
"There's one simple answer: both arms and aid are provided by corporations that make immense money by doing so,  courtesy of the public's tax dollars.    This is a result of bribery being legal in the USA. we call it lobbying.   So if corporations value money over human life,  so will the US government.  Everything evil that can be conducted that will result in profits WILL be done.  10k+ children victims?  Well, they are ""brown"" so the American public won't make too much fuss about it, and the profits for the few can continue.",Chimichanga007,2024-09-25T13:23:43,1
Ok money I get it.   But they portray Biden as a nice guy.   How can he look at himself in the mirror when he has the blood of over 40k on his hands?   Or am I being too harsh?   A genocide seems obviously bad. Am I missing something?   How does this money outweigh 40k lives.   Isn't Biden supposed to be Catholic and a man of God. ,En1ite,2024-10-05T07:24:12,1

"Netanyahu is doing too much for sure. And Biden is trying not to lose our only connection in the Middle East because we obviously can’t let an incident like 9/11 happen again. We need the intelligence. Hamas and Hezbollah are ultimately at fault for making this whole situation so much worse right now, and the innocent people of Gaza are paying for their extremism. Israel wants to deal with the terrorists once and for all, but it’s honestly overkill.  A ceasefire must happen soon. The entire situation is very dark and just complicated, but we all agree that Netanyahu needs to enter peace talks for a longer term solution here.",cstennis,2024-10-14T21:39:27,1

"I already know Netanyahu is bad.    But I can't reconcile how bad Biden and his people are.   What US benefit outweighs 40k lives?   All that good stuff they say about Genocide Joe seems moot, well, compared to the genocide he is funding.   9-11 on repeat is small potatoes compared to 40k lives and counting.    I can't reconcile the U.S part in all of this.    I can't see the math on this one. ",En1ite,2024-10-17T07:56:22,1
Biden can still get intelligence if he stops funding Israel.     I don't know. Maybe Biden doesn't want N to turn to China or Russia for funding instead.    I still think Biden can have his cake and eat it too even if he withholds funding for a while.    But then Kamala might lose the election. So there's that chess too. ,En1ite,2024-10-17T08:01:14,1
