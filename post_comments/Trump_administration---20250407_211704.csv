So they fired a decorated NATO commander for supporting diversity. Are they replacing her with someone who thinks strength comes from uniformity and vibes?  Or just someone who won’t say the word diversity out loud?,erg99,2025-04-07T21:33:08,1

"*The letter said Chatfield posted supportive comments on LinkedIn about a diversity summit and gave a speech in 2015 at Women’s Equality Day. The group quoted her as saying that investing in empowering women can unlock human potential.*  *And they also said she was quoted as saying, “our diversity is our strength” — a phrase that Hegseth has repeatedly condemned.*   She was fired for years old comments that didn't draw any ire if you are a rational adult.",Ok-Lets-Talk-It-Out,2025-04-07T21:41:10,1

I’m pretty sure they fired her for being a woman and are replacing her with a white man. Because something something “diversity hire.” Because the alcoholic Fox News host who got put in charge of the military wants to make it a “meritocracy”.,Violet-Journey,2025-04-07T21:39:16,1
