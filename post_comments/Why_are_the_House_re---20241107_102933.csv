"Mail in ballots. Overseas ballots. Active duty military ballots. If a state has president candidate A up by 100,000 votes and there are only 100,000 mail in ballots to open and count, you can call it for candidate A. If a local congressional candidate is up by 5000 votes but there are 100,000 mail ins to open and count, you have to open and count them first.",Outrageous-Intern278,2024-11-08T22:07:11,1
"Because California takes forever due to the deadlines for overseas ballots and mail-ins. This is just standard procedure. Alaska is also very late normally. And for that reason we cannot yet say how many votes the presidential candidates got--or even who won the popular vote for sure. At this point (11:30pm, 11/9), Trump has 74million and Harris has 70million.   Also, House races take a while because of things like automatic recounts triggered by very close results, and the same for races with ranked-choice voting that have to go to multiple ballot counts.",DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-09T22:25:53,1
