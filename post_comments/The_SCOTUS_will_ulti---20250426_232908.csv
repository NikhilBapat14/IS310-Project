"Mr. LaPerriere is the only financial expert I have heard analyzing Trump's self-decreed import taxes at Square 1; namely, that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs (that is Congress' purview according to the Constitution), because the ""emergency"" Trump is using as the basis for his out-of-control 8-year-old-driving-an-18-wheeler tariff insanity is not an actual emergency. Well said!  **THE FATE OF TRUMP's TARIFFS -- Piper Sandler's Andy LaPierriere Says:**  * Believe Trump is violating the law by invoking the Intl. Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his tariffs * It is likely that Trump will eventually lose in court on tariffs * Trump's use of this statute is a stretch on the merits",Nerd-19958,2025-04-26T23:36:53,43

We would need a congress willing to stand up to Trump for it to matter. He has no checks and balances preventing him from doing whatever he wants.,RealGianath,2025-04-26T23:38:34,14

"""The SCOTUS will ultimately overturn Trump's tariffs, says Piper Sandler's Andy Laperriere"" Clearly, Andy hasn't been paying attention.",keninsd,2025-04-26T23:49:46,7
I agree with this analysis.  The question is how long it takes to eventually reach SCOTUS and if Trump just tries some other BS justification and we go make to square one.,AaminMarritza,2025-04-27T00:11:46,4

"Yes but by then a whole lot of businesses will go under, and more significantly, the world is busy figuring out how to avoid doing business with the USA, and they're not going to just lightly flip right back when they're done.   This situation is like the guy who punches his wife in the face and then thinks everything is fine because he stops punching her and tells her he loves her.   The USA is punching the world in the face and thinking she's just going to forget about it. Hell, right now the USA is terrorizing the rest of the world with vague threats just like a domestic abuser ""If you leave me I'll just drag you back"" ""don't think you can just walk out on me"".  Frankly the USA has had an abusive relationship with the rest of the world for a while. Oh there were good times sometimes, GREAT times even, but everyone knew how the USA could get and there's been a lot of trying to make it work.      But in classic abuser fashion, that's just made the USA more likely to fly off the handle at the littlest thing.  When the USA wakes up from this severe bender and starts to try to act normal it's going to realize that everyone else is gone, that the bank accounts have been cleared out, that we can keep the house, and that our number is blocked on everyone's phones.   The USA is already done. We just haven't woken up to the empty house yet.   But we're going to.",maeryclarity,2025-04-27T05:43:27,5
"The cases Laperreirre uses as proof that SCOTUS is willing to say ""the law is the law"" don't support his point. Cases like West Virginia vs. EPA or Loper-Bright took power away from agencies in the executive branch (federal agencies), but *not* the president.  I would have pointed to NLRB v. Canning if anything",AWall925,2025-04-27T00:24:11,3
"I doubt the Supreme Court will actually do that, what I’m guessing will actually happen is that they will give a 5-4 ruling with Roberts joining the liberals in dissenting that goes something like “whether or not an emergency declaration is valid or not is necessarily a political question and therefore not reviewable by the courts” with the dissent going something like “this is dangerous and means as long as the president controls congress they can rule via emergency powers with zero judicial review and could end in all sorts of abuses”  This is nonsense legal theory and goes against legal precedent and is wildly dangerous but that hasn’t stopped the current Supreme Court from, for example, giving him blanket immunity for criminal prosecution from his acts in office.",jonermon,2025-04-27T04:28:48,3

It's not happening because what's he's doing is legal due to Congress forfeiting that power willingly. It'd be up to the Congress to overturn it.,iuthnj34,2025-04-27T01:14:19,1

SCOTUS won't rule that way because there are 100+ other emergency powers being used by the executive branch that are not emergencies but handle the mundane functioning of the government. It would cripple the federal government until 2050.,Borne2Run,2025-04-27T07:45:10,2
Kavanaugh and Barrett have already shown their willingness to side with the liberal judges and don't seem like they owe Trump anything. Barrett specifically. That viral video of her wincing at Trump after his address to Congress last month was hilarious.,PhatYeeter,2025-04-27T02:22:46,11
"Per the video, all SCOTUS has to do is uphold the law and the Constitution -- which is in line with their conservative philosophy.  The Constitution gives Congress the right to determine the budget and income (e.g. taxes, including import sales taxes). Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to seize authority to set / revoke tariffs willy-nilly is clearly unjustified  by any reasonable standard, because there simply is no economic emergency.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-27T00:17:39,19

Of course they'll do it. The alternative is a completely wrecked economy. Trump has already destroyed decades of institutional establishment within the economy. He's about to get put on a tight leash as far as the economy is concerned.,TheCommonGround1,2025-04-27T04:41:49,2

"Your reasoning is like a bully claiming that his victims attacked his fists with their faces.   In other words, bullshit.

"It won't take long.  California and other states have filed suit in federal district court.  Chances are high that the court will rule for California.  That will move it to the 9th Circuit appeals court, which is usually liberal.   If the Supremes don't grant cert, then the appeals court decision will stand.   If the Supreme Court does hear it, then I would bet on a 7-2 ruling against the executive branch.  Even some of the court conservatives appear to be getting tired of this overreach.",I405CA,2025-04-27T02:06:18,23
