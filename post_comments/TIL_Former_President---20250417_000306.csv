"To be fair, if you are ""a leader in an organization actively engaged in armed conflict against the United States"" and operating on foreign soil, I have no problem if the President takes you out - citizen or not.  It's by definition ""extrajudicial,"" just like the El Salvadorian dude who is now in El Salvador.",yanman,2025-04-17T12:56:48,45
"The Obama administration today argued before a federal court that it should have unreviewable authority to kill Americans the executive branch has unilaterally determined to pose a threat. Government lawyers made that claim in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) charging that the administration‚Äôs asserted targeted killing authority violates the Constitution and international law. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard arguments from both sides today.  November 8th, 2010!!!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T01:10:13,338
It will always shocks me how few democrats know about this.   In a different media landscape I think this type of scandal would have seen Obama impeached.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-17T00:50:33,468

The reason you don't hear much about it is because conservatives are ok with bombing a terrorist on foreign soil and Democrats are ok with anything their Lord and Savior Obama does. So no one is going to fight him on this.,Hectoriu,2025-04-17T08:33:05,35

This can't be true! Obama's biggest scandal was that he wore a tan suit!,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-17T07:47:05,6
"Obama set us on the current path of a corrupt media establishment.  In addition to doubling down on all the things he said he didn‚Äôt like (Patriot Act, Guantanamo, this disposition matrix), he had a concentrated campaign to consolidate media power. His entire nat sec council were the family members of network executives, he handed out ambassadorships and board chairs like candy to friendly media, while imprisoning and sending the IRS after unfriendly media.",LemartesIX,2025-04-17T08:51:16,5

"Yup, I've known for years.  But it would basically illegal to call out Obama on anything or risk getting called a racist.  People on the left, and even some on the right remember the Obama years fondly, but IMO Obama was one of the top three worst presidents in history.  He did incredible damage to our country, culture, and the world.  If he had actually been the person he ran as in 2008, his admin wouldn't have been half bad...but holy hell did you go off the deep end.  Btw, sounds like BO is getting a divorce soon.",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-17T10:41:42,-3
So are you saying Trump knows about this and has done literally nothing to go back in time and stop an obvious innocent mistake by Obama?  Edit: wow either this sub is being brigaded or no one can see clear sarcasm.,Sgthouse,2025-04-17T04:47:07,-33

"There were plenty of Dems that know about it, it was all over the news back in the day.  I surmise that the OP wanted to illustrate an instance where a previous president made an apparent denial of due process.

Almost as disturbing as how few democrats know about this is how many neocons defend this as one of the few things they think Obama did right.  The old GOP needs to be viewed with just as much disdain as the democrat party.,Shadeylark,2025-04-17T18:11:01,1

"They did after the first 9/11  There are/were tons of people who thought GTMO was some evil place and that all of these terrorists should either be tried in their own countries or brought to the US and tried in civilian courts and stay in civilian prisons.   I mean, there‚Äôs even full blown documentaries abd books about these ‚Äúproud‚Äù lawyers who defended the terrorists because, as they spin in, in doing so they‚Äôre defending the law.   It‚Äôs just so frustrating.   These are the same people who pretend they would fight Russia in Ukraine and defeat the Nazis in WWII that care more about this BS when it comes to enemies of the state.

"They actually aren't. 4 of the people accused of being 911 hijackers are still alive and live in Canada.
