I tip my hat to the Boise city council and mayor.  Not only is adopting the pride flag a staunch defense of liberty and free speech but it is also trolling the shitstains trying to take it away.,Fanticide,2025-05-06T23:10:58,846

"For those interested in how this move complies with the new law, here is the text of the bill that recently passed (going into effect immediately):  > 67-2303A. FLAGS -- PROPER PROTOCOL.   > (1) As used in this section, ""governmental entity"" means the state of Idaho or any county, municipality, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the state other than a school, college, or university.  > (2) A governmental entity shall not display a flag on its property other than the following:   > (a) The United States flag;   > **(b) The official flag of a governmental entity as defined in this section;**   > (c) Official flags of any state in the United States;   > (d) Official flags of any of the military branches and units of the United States;   > (e) The POW/MIA flag as provided for in section 67-2303, Idaho Code;   > (f) Official flags of Indian tribes;   > (g) Official flags of countries other than the United States to commemorate special occasions; and   > (h) Official flags of Idaho colleges, universities, and public schools.  So, by officially adopting said flags as official, they comply with the law (which currently has no enforcement mechanism); any subsequent attempt to define or limit ""official flags"" could raise First Amendment issues of viewpoint discrimination.",JuDGe3690,2025-05-07T12:15:06,8
