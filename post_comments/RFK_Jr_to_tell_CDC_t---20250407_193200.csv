"America is too stupid to survive this century. We‚Äôve embraced the dumbest of the fucking lot for too long, and normalized empowering them.  The smartest people in the room either manipulate the morons for power and influence, or treat the lunatics as equals.  We‚Äôre so unimaginably fucked",acceptance1085,2025-04-07T19:51:26,1

"From the article:  Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he‚Äôs assembling a taskforce to focus on the issue.  Also on Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was reviewing ‚Äúnew scientific information‚Äù on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA has primary authority to set the maximum level of fluoridation in public water systems.",kootles10,2025-04-07T19:32:14,1
">Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.  >The Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by 7 May.  >Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as ‚Äúthe leader in making America healthy again‚Äù. He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state‚Äôs fluoride law.  >‚ÄúI‚Äôm very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,‚Äù he said.",fungobat,2025-04-07T19:42:02,1
"Years ago I used to work for a new dentist. He did his schooling in a large metropolitan centre with fluoride in the city water. His first practice was in a small rural town with no fluoride added to the water. He mentioned how amazed he was with the difference in the teeth of the children. The city kids had far, far fewer cavities than did the rural kids, like noticeably so.",foodbytes,2025-04-07T19:59:43,1
