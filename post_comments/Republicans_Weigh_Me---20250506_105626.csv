"As someone who works in healthcare, Medicaid is a crucial lifeline to someone who's been laid off. I mean, the primary qualifier to receive Medicaid is to be low income. Someone who's unemployed is exactly the kind of person who needs Medicaid, and just having basic access to health services isn't going to stop someone from looking for new employment.",Golden_Taint,2025-05-06T11:11:43,44

The problem is so many people on Medicaid are already working. It's just sad they are so low paid in their jobs. If Republicans really cared about fixing healthcare they'd get rid of private insurance and just apply the same rate as a tax. Boom fixed.,Faucet860,2025-05-06T11:06:45,34

"*More from Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson:*  House Republicans are considering establishing work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients starting at age 18 and through age 64, New York Representative Nicole Malliotakis said Tuesday.  New requirements for the program, which insures 72 million low-income and disabled people, would be a cost-saving move that would free up money for President Donald Trump’s expansive tax package.  Medicaid has emerged as a key sticking in Republicans’ ongoing negotiations, with moderates and Trump saying they oppose any cuts to the program’s benefits.

"""But there's an exemption if you're disabled.""  No, there isn't.  As a quick-and-dirty estimate:  There are about 204,000,000 working age adults. During major wars, conscript forces would usually exempt about 20% of the population for obvious disabilities. So you would have well over 40,000,000 disabled working-age adults. As of 2020, 9,700,000 of them have ssdi; as of 2019, 4,646,559 of them have ssi. At least 25,000,000 Americans are disabled working-age adults, are not receiving disability benefits, and would be subject to work requirements for healthcare.  But sure, adding work requirements to Medicaid is a common-sense policy. It’s one that makes poor people’s survival depend, more and more, on being useful to the rich oligarchs who run this country.",Ananiujitha,2025-05-06T13:03:32,8

"Let me add just a little truth in advertising to this statement.  Anecdotal, but it's real world.  This will be a little long, but let me tell my story.  In 2017 I had kidney failure from a bad reaction to a medication.  I drew the short straw.  That proverbial bus came out of nowhere and hit me.  My life, career, dreams all stopped.  I had to go on disability and dialysis.  This made me eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.  I'll skip over the nearly four years of headache and heartache that was dealing with it all. But, in 2021 I was very lucky and received a transplant.  The rules currently say that after a transplant you are allowed to keep Medicare for up to 36 months.  The only exception is if the kidney is rejected and you must go back on dialysis.  Then, it can continue.  I have done well post transplant, but not perfect.  I struggle with stamina / energy, pain and numbess, polycythemia, have issues with medications that leads to days I can barely even get out of bed, experience immune suppression issues meaning I have to be very careful around people, and require regular very expensive treatments (infusions / phlebotomies, etc.) to stay stable and alive.  In February of 2024 I hit my three years post transplant.  Even though I am not physically able to return to work full time according to my care team the SSA deemed me able to return to work because I was not back on dialysis.  My care team appealed, but to no avail.  I could have hired an attorney, but chose not to.  I was tired of fighting and optimistic about the future.  As such I lost Medicare, Disability, SNAP, and all assistance except Medicaid.     I am eligible for Medicaid because I am in an expansion state and am way below the income limit.  When I lost disability I started a very small lapidary business that earns me a little money.  I had no choice, you have to have some income.  It's home based and allows me to do what I can, when I can.  Barely enough to get by.  Less than I received from Disability each month.  A lot less.  If it wasn't for Medicaid I would not be able to afford the medications I need to live and the treatments that keep me alive.  I could not pay a monthly premium, plus any out of pocket.  My medications alone are nearly $2000 a month.  One treatment, which I need every three months or so, is $4000.  This all adds up fast.  Thanks to Trump's tariffs my small business is about to go under.  The 145% tariff on China coupled with the de minimus elimination has crippled my business.  Even my primary wholesaler is no longer shipping to the United States.  Once my current stock is gone I'm done unless something changes.  Then, what?  Will I now lose my healthcare, too?  That's a sob story I know, but it's also real life.  A version of it is playing out all over the country right now.  People unable to work for one reason or another, but not able to qualify for disability, or still fighting through the multi-year process to be approved for disability, are scared they will lose the healthcare that keeps them alive.  Personally, if I lose Medicaid, I lose my life.  There's no inbetween.  No meds, no kidney... no life.  It's just that simple.    So, let me make this a little personal.  Hello, my name is Cliff.  I beg of you, please tell your Reps to not vote to take away healthcare from and maybe even end up killing people like me.  We didn't do anything to you.  We just want to live and be as healthy as we can.  We want to be with our families and friends.  We want to try to contribute to society in some way.  We matter to someone and they matter to us.  Please don't forget that there are people, real people, behind these policy discussions.  We're more than just statistics.  We are people, too.",Hypothesising_Null,2025-05-06T16:30:54,11
"I don't have the heart to tell this to my mother in law, who is certain that they won't do this to people who already depend on Medicaid, but this - exactly. ""If you think they will stop there, won't come for your benefits next, just watch."" She says things like ""they can't do that"" and all I want to say is, that's our money!   We're still working, we pay those taxes, and if they can do it to us, it can happen to you too. But I don't want to be overly cruel. Some people need to hear it though.",yebyen,2025-05-06T12:07:44,3

"As a semi-able bodied person, the biggest barrier is having a consistent primary care doctor. You have to submit paperwork annually indicating why you can’t work full time or whatever their work requirement hours are. It’s not difficult in terms of getting or staying on benefits, but it is complicated if you don’t have an ongoing relationship with a good enough doctor.  Also, most people on Medicaid and nearly all people on Medicaid Expansion are already working.   Alabama or Georgia already tried work requirements and it was so bad they stopped it. It’s nearly impossible for the Medicaid office to stay up with current paperwork requirements. Adding monthly work verification paperwork resulted in tons of qualified people not getting benefits. Which I know is the point. But it is fucking stupid. Not being insured costs far more than just giving qualified people Medicaid.",MyPartsareLoud,2025-05-06T11:22:07,15

"Thanks for reading it.  I don't particular like making myself the center of attention, but if my screwed up situation can put a human face (well, username) to all this then it is worth it.  With all the rhetoric about how ""able bodied"" adults on Medicaid are all ""moochers"" and ""lazy bums"" I think it is important for people to know that in reality it's usually just regular people who for one reason or another just need some help.  It's people with bad luck, like me.  Caregivers who work thanklessly to support another.  People who are scared, hurt, and often sick.  People stuck fighting a bureaucracy they may not even understand to get the care they otherwise deserve.    Sure there are always people who will try to take advantage.  But, they are the minority.  Is it really worth the pain to everyone else just to punish the very few?",Hypothesising_Null,2025-05-06T20:53:50,1
