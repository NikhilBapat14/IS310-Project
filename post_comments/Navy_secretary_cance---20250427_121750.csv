This shows how the decision-making is more about emotion and political points than data-driven decision that support the long term security and strategic interests of the country. Even before Trump's first term in office the DOD called out the risk of Climate Change and the need to adopt green technologies that would provide a tactical advantage over traditional ICE equipment:  [https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/612710/dod-releases-report-on-security-implications-of-climate-change/](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/612710/dod-releases-report-on-security-implications-of-climate-change/)  [https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/11/09/electric-military-vehicles-are-part-of-biden-climate-agenda-pentagon-says.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/11/09/electric-military-vehicles-are-part-of-biden-climate-agenda-pentagon-says.html),thepryz,2025-04-27T12:39:22,6

"Biden should have given massive tax breaks to millionaires and committed to stripping public programs before he left. Then this group of chuckle f*cks would have done the exact opposite just to say they “defeated” Biden.   Honestly can anyone explain how everything they manage to do is the exact opposite of what should be done? Does it even make anyone money? I feel like it’s not a grift sometimes, it’s just pure spite and no one wins.",NoCoffee6754,2025-04-27T13:09:58,1
