"> Then on Thursday, May 22, Trump is slated to attend a dinner for the top 220 investors in his memecoin, $Trump. Around 80 percent of the memecoin’s supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and its affiliates.   A little math:  So 764,000 investers have lost money in $Trump's crypto while only 86 investors have profited.  Trump is selling 220 tickets at $1.5 million each to his top investors. So 134 of his top investors, have lost money and are still going to pony up a million and a half on top of their losses.  Am I missing something here? Is the orange shitgibbons cult of personality that powerful these fucking dolts are willing to piss away there fortunes?  Absolutely bananas",biscuitarse,2025-05-07T18:16:35,2

"This is corruption at its heart. It’s perfectly legal so far. It’s nothing more than another way for wealthy, corporate interests to buy government favoritism.   Is this any different than paying off a local mob boss for protection? I’m guessing it goes a little further than corporate lobbyists paying for favors. I’m suggesting that people who don’t pay don’t get to play and could see penalties by various government agencies if they don’t pay for their protection meme coins and million dollar dinners.",Flat-Emergency4891,2025-05-07T21:42:15,1

"It’s not ethics concerns. It is violations of the Emoluments clause of the constitution. This isn’t breaking the law, or going against whitehouse tradition or norms. This is a violation of the constitution. Enforcement of the constitution is not optional, failure to enforce one part of it dissolves the legitimacy of the document as a whole. This is why laws and court rulings are judged against the constitution.",Cobs85,2025-05-07T18:47:06,24

Yeah ik he has been more blatant. I just remember last time they put on that little show with all the blank pages in the folders stacked up. Didnt even bother doing that this time. Press would have helped him just like last time on it.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-07T18:47:53,3
