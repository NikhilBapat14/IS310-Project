At least Republicans will be relieved they don't have to wear a mask and since there's no vaccine for stupidity they don't have to worry about that either.,biscuitarse,2025-05-01T07:35:58,260
"And just like Covid, businesses not affected by tariffs will use the opportunity to increase prices ",Significant-Ad-8684,2025-05-01T07:35:44,114
Prices are already higher and it’s noticeable. I just wonder if we’re going to see empty shelves for random items. And it’s entirely due to one person: Donald Trump.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-01T07:39:13,68

"The rich got richer due to Covid. It's not just the billionaires. Roughly about the upper half got wealthier. It's no surprise they voted for this. Also why there's no effective push back.    At least with the great recession, high earning professionals we're out of their jobs. Their careers evaporated overnight. They lost their homes. So they eventually joined the protests. They voted for their own interests which aligned with the lower classes. This time if you're below let's say about median income then you're all on your own to organize amongst yourselves.

I'm surprised Trump and RFK Jr haven't collaborated to ban masks or put a 1000% tariff/tax on them.  I don't think they stop miasmas or whatever it is he thinks makes people sick.,SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-05-01T12:08:53,1

No. It's due to literally the entire Republican party. Trump is lightning rod. Don't let them wash their hands of this mess.  They could stop this. They could hold him accountable. They could pass legislation.  They won't. They're either complicit or they're cowards. But they're responsible.,severedbrain,2025-05-01T09:09:32,9
Incorrect- the entire Republican Party is responsible as well as all the people who voted for him and all the people who stayed home. There are a LOT of folks to blame here.
