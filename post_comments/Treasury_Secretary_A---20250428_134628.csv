Probably going to announce a new Treasury Secretary tomorrow.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-28T13:58:33,101
It’s the 1st on Thursday. Time to engineer the monthly market manipulation for the billionaire class.,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T14:17:24,24
Because everything in the past has been scripted for him. He still thinks he's doing a reality show and that the producers will bring him a completed script showing he's resolved everything and that everyone loves him. That Putin came up with tears in his eyes and begged for forgiveness. That Xi and China agrees to all his terms on trade and also came with tears in his eyes.,TwistedMemories,2025-04-28T14:09:18,18
"And yet Wall Street isn’t in free fall.  What is keeping the markets afloat? I’m honestly curious. I don’t want them to tank, but what is keeping them held up at this point? Is it Trumps charm? What is it?  It’s an open secret that companies are simply saying the right things to keep Trump happy. Any steps taken to meet his demands are to appease him until the market crashes and then they’re just going to scrap all plans for investment. Why delay it? What’s the current long term play that isn’t more widely known?",hmr0987,2025-04-28T14:17:42,23
"China has the big stick in that spat.  Sure, I am sure they are feeling it.  But not as much as the US market is feeling it or going to feel it in the coming weeks\\months as stuff runs out.  I am part of a kickstarter campaign that is starting to ship soon.  They originally were to ship all North American orders to the US and distribute from there.  Now, they are securing a warehouse in Canada to receive the entire order and the current plan is to have the US orders stored there until things calm down and it is viable for them to ship without getting dinged massive tariffs.  There are hundreds if not thousands of small businesses that are putting everything on hold because of these tariffs.",nutano,2025-04-28T15:19:30,7
The stock market should be dropping daily due to the tariffs. Why isn't it? Is the market still being manipulated ,Other-Net-3262,2025-04-28T14:01:44,7
200 trade deals = maybe they'll call me one day?,NeoConTroll,2025-04-28T14:44:31,4
"China should call collect out of spite, when they feel like it. No fan of China, but they hold the winning hand in the sense that Trump decided to go all in with a two of spades and a four of diamonds at the flop, playing on a mirrored betting table.",steve_ample,2025-04-28T13:54:26,8
No trade deals will be made this Trump term. He got rid of all the folks who can move anything forward. These next 3+ years are gonna be a loss.,DarthSnoopyFish,2025-04-28T18:56:45,3

"Thing is, whatever he is, he’s been able to suck tens of millions of people in to his messed up version of reality, including people who should know better. Every single thing that would have destroyed any other politician bounces off him. There is no accountability.   He got re-elected following 35 felony counts, two impeachments, the scandal with the classified papers at Mar-a-lago, rape scandals, connections to Epstein, pro-Russia, ideas every single intelligent economist said would crash the economy and so much more. Let all that sink in for a moment. It is really, really unbelievably fucking weird.",Saidhain,2025-04-28T18:10:27,9
"My best guess is that a lot of investors are still basically hoping this all blows over and in a couple weeks Trump announces the greatest trade deal ever with China (i.e., worse than we started, but only by an amount we can live with).   (My own view is that a perfect beautiful trade deal with China probably will happen soon, but Trump will immediately cause chaos in some other way, so there's no winning this.)",pervocracy,2025-04-28T15:20:56,10
Just look at Tesla stock. Should be like burning money atm due to sales dropping and their reputation being in the shitter but noooo. Wonder if some people/countries are buying more favors from Trump/Musk,StrikingAnxiety5527,2025-04-28T14:28:31,20
Probably some smart investors who know this isn’t sustainable and trump will fold,pat_abh,2025-04-28T15:07:46,7
I read an article earlier today that said the hedge funds and major investors have been selling. It's mostly individual traders who have been buying lately.   So it's possible that's why the market doesn't seem to be operating rationally. If that's true it also means a lot of people are likely about to lose a lot of money.,blueclawsoftware,2025-04-28T15:15:16,5
Q2 results will show that the economy is in recession and once layoffs start it will spook the market.   Investors are shunning the bond market and the USD is likely to continue its slide. At the moment investors have nowhere else to go other than back into gold.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T16:28:58,4
"Investors have mentally ""blue screened"" with the current environment where inside info into Trump's social media posts is more valuable than any supercomputer or algorithm.  They are paralyzed and unable to make any real decisions until their hands are forced by reality and jobs numbers/earnings/GDP/etc get really bad.  They may dip capital in and out of the market but they are keeping one foot in the pool, ready to dive back in at any second.  That's lingering optimism at play.  Warren Buffet was well ahead of this, as usual.  He's running a custom OS in that head of his.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-28T16:31:44,2
"People think the impacts of tariffs are done. It’s the frog boiling water analogy. They watched them turn the flame on, and they don’t see any changes. We did see a pretty rapid drop with the reciprocal tariffs.   Maybe everything is not going to make a difference. I mean all the weekly jobless claims are lower than they were most of 2024. Prices haven’t done much of anything yet.",trogdor1234,2025-04-29T03:15:52,1

"Give it three weeks. Once the shelves on the west coast start going bare and panic buying sets in, Wall Street will sink like a rock in water. I think it's currently being held up on the hope that Trump caves on his Chinese tariffs, which Trump and Bissent signaled last week. But it can only hold for so long until people start to figure out that Trump is too narcissistic to cave. I'm betting on it being too late anyway. Chinese ships stopped leaving China on April 10th and the west coast ports are going silent.",Myrtle_Nut,2025-04-28T14:40:17,9
"The chance for the stock market, and more likely treasuries to force the issue has come and gone I'm afraid, and it effectively was scuttled by Trump and co. through April 9th and statements last week.   It's now more likely that other stuff pops up as shocking, like shortages, but it'll still be a minute.",95Daphne,2025-04-28T14:39:18,5

"So where do you move your money when everythings on fire?  Gold is popular, but not for the big players.    Also its very jumpy...but its STILL managed to lose 10% since Trump was elected.  Which is a massive amount of loss.  Why isnt it more?  Because people seem to think Trump is going to blink.  What they dont get is that he is too invested now to change course, so he just lies to everyone.",greywar777,2025-04-28T16:39:43,2

"Right but that assumes any deal with China is achieved before it matters.  The reality I don’t get is business leaders largely only care about one thing, money. Trump is certainly costing them a lot. If a deal is made with China I think you’re right, it will put us worse off than where we were on January 19th. So then how does he STILL have any support? It’s unbelievable.",hmr0987,2025-04-28T15:25:08,2

It’s very confusing cause to the somewhat ignorant (me, I’m not a finance person) it sure seems like the market sell off should be much more intense.  Which is sad cause I feel like a lot of companies prior to Trump taking office were finally ready to invest their cash they’ve been hoarding since COVID. Is that why things are holding for now?
