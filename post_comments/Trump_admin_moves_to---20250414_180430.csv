"I don‚Äôt really know how to feel, sure they both have become more partisan (NPR especially so) but PBS in particular was very important in children‚Äôs programming along with just being a great source of entertainment",just_one_random_guy,2025-04-14T22:31:52,505

"I used to feel less strongly about shutting down their funding but the political slant has gone too far and it sends downstream messages.

I‚Äôm all for defunding NPR. It‚Äôs been a long time since I watched PBS but when I did it seemed to be non-partisan. The kids shows decades ago were good.,jeon2595,2025-04-14T18:57:01,1

"I actually became republican when I realized that everything I heard on NPR was being delivered through a very leftist lens. They don't tell outright lies, but they absolutely omit, embellish, and frame everything that gets aired. That and when Last Week Tonight did their hit piece on the NRA years and years ago.

"Back in the day I listened to a classical radio station during my commute because it didn't have the annoying chuckleheads.  At the top of the hour they had BBC World news headlines.  It wasn't bad. Mostly a quick summary of the news item, but you could sometimes notice the Labour slant in some of the reporting.  Then they switched to NPR.  I quickly noticed a pattern to NPR's reporting.  If the Republicans were doing a thing, they would interview a Democrat (or Democrat ally) and tell us why it as a bad thing.  If a Democrat was doing a thing, they would release a sound-bite from the thing and then editorialize on why that was a good thing.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-15T07:21:46,-1
