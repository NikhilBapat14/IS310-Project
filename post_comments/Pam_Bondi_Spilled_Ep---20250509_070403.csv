O'Keefe and Bondi are both evil. I don't believe a word either says.,def_indiff,2025-05-09T07:15:25,2703
"As per [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pam-bondi-spilled-jeffrey-epstein-secrets-to-bogus-nanny-at-brunch/) üì∞:  - Days before she announced ‚Äúthousands of videos‚Äù of evidence in the Jeffrey Epstein case, Attorney General Pam Bondi was secretly recorded sharing the information with a woman at a restaurant pretending to be a nanny.  The woman turned out to be wearing a hidden camera for O‚ÄôKeefe Media Group, the latest venture of MAGA provocateur James O‚ÄôKeefe.  [O‚ÄôKeefe shared a 15-second clip of the video](https://x.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1920625663012127191) Thursday showing Bondi eating brunch in a restaurant. A woman who had just approached her asks, ‚ÄúDo you know when the Epstein files are going to get released?‚Äù  ‚ÄúUm, we hope soon,‚Äù Bondi answers. ‚ÄúThe FBI has been on them.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOK, any dates?‚Äù the woman presses as Bondi tries to ignore her and keep eating.  ‚ÄúNo, you know what it is, though? There are tens and thousands of videos and it‚Äôs all with little kids. So, they have to go through every one [of them],‚Äù Bondi says.  The video doesn‚Äôt show what happened before or after those few lines of conversation.  O‚ÄôKeefe, the founder of Project Veritas, has been accused for years of publishing videos that are deceptively edited to misrepresent their subjects. In 2023 he was forced out of the company he founded and sued for allegedly bullying staff and misusing funds. Around the same time, he was also the subject of a criminal investigation.  The Daily Beast has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.  During his segment, O‚ÄôKeefe said the woman wearing the hidden camera had identified herself as a nanny, though he didn‚Äôt say how or why that came up in conversation. Bondi doesn‚Äôt have any children.  But on Wednesday, nine days after O‚ÄôKeefe says the recording was made, Bondi told reporters about the videos for the first time.  ‚ÄúThere are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn,‚Äù she said at a press conference. ‚ÄúThere are hundreds of victims, and no one victim will ever get released. It‚Äôs just the volume, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre going through right now.‚Äù  O‚ÄôKeefe claims Bondi made the announcement after his team reached out to her on May 1 revealing the hidden camera recording and asking why the American people had never been made aware of the videos.  ‚ÄúWe would love the opportunity to sit down with the Attorney General to get further clarification‚Äù on her comments, O‚ÄôKeefe Media Group wrote in an email.  In an article on his website, O‚ÄôKeefe wrote that ‚Äúno formal response was provided,‚Äù without elaborating. Days later, Bondi later used almost the exact same wording during Wednesday‚Äôs press conference, the article said.  ‚ÄúDoes this show that a government apparatus is still working behind the scenes to protect powerful people involved in the scandal?‚Äù O‚ÄôKeefe said during his segment revealing the secret recording.  For months Bondi has vowed to release new bombshell evidence in the case of Epstein, the American financier and sex offender who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.  She faced a MAGA mutiny in March after releasing binders full of ‚Äúnew‚Äù information that turned out to be mostly documents that were already publicly available. At the time, she blamed the FBI for not providing anything revelatory.",T_Shurt,2025-05-09T07:07:45,626
