If tons of people are suddenly in violation of federal law, this means the state has the opportunity to arrest and charge anyone they do not like - as the selective enforcement of a universally broken law is a de facto authoritarian state.

"The problem with the medical/""legal"" weed industries is that for our lifetimes it's always been illegal at the federal level. The feds just decided not to enforce those laws, which means once an administration comes along that wants to enforce them the people openly selling/using/etc weed in defiance of those federal laws are fucked.  In other words, there is no ""legal weed"" in the US and there hasn't been for a very, very long time. The marijuana legalization movement ignored the federal government and the federal government may be coming to collect on that.  People just trusted that the federal government didn't *want* to fuck those people over, but now we have people in charge that are intentionally trying to use the power of the federal government to fuck certain groups and states over, and they can do so pretty easily from their perspective by once again enforcing the laws already on the books about marijuana, especially if they only do so in states and to the people that they don't like.",LangyMD,2025-05-03T20:14:39,20

"California could only ever dominate the US market if the state allowed it. High taxes and costs of operation for legit growers means that while California has the largest legal market by dollar amount, they also still have one of, if not the largest, black markets in the country. Michigan has actually surpassed California's legal market by volume of products sold and that's only possible because of reasonable costs of entry into the market that allow for a competitive environment, relatively low taxes (effectively 16.6% on recreational) at the register and a competitive market which happens to be boosted by high prices, illegality and/or poor access in surrounding states.",Tasty-Traffic-680,2025-05-04T01:51:50,2

" “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

"It’s not even just across state lines. Anybody who possesses or grows marijuana (medical or otherwise) is in violation of federal law, regardless of where they take it.  The federal government’s ability to regulate intrastate conduct (under an expansive interpretation of its power to regulate “[commerce…among the several states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause)”) has been largely settled since [*Wickard v. Filburn*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/317us111), which upheld a punishment against a farmer who harvested more wheat than he was legally allowed to harvest (even though he claimed the extra harvested wheat was only used to feed his own animals). This doctrine forms the fundamental constitutional basis for the entire administrative state, as well as for [most modern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Atlanta_Motel,_Inc._v._United_States) [civil rights legislation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenbach_v._McClung).  This has been applied to medical marijuana itself — in [*Gonzales v. Raich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich), the Supreme Court held that Congress could prohibit a person from growing their own medical marijuana for their own personal use, even if they did so pursuant to a doctor’s recommendation, and even if medical marijuana was legal under state law.",NoobSalad41,2025-05-04T04:58:37,2
"Yeah. That’s what I thought. I’ve been waiting to see if Trump uses that hammer just to hurt people and businesses in states. It’s another tool to control and stomp state autonomy.  Federal authority has been used to encourage (and sometimes forcefully coerce) states to comply with preferred policy in the past and by the left. But the policy from the left leans toward enhancing rights, protecting health and preserving resources.  The Trump/right’s version of federal authority is more about coercion or downright extortion. This administration’s preferred policy is to remove rights, control narratives, eliminate protections for health/environment and just plain hurt people.",kck93,2025-05-04T10:32:10,1

This goes especially for minorities and marginalized groups.  Edit: oh yeah, and the dog thing really gets me. They’ve done a really good job brainwashing the public to think dogs are nearly infallible. Yeah, dogs have a great nose, but they’re only as good as their training. And dogs aren’t stupid. They know when something is up. When they know they’re supposed to find something to make master happy I think some poorly trained dogs just lie. Besides that, you wouldn’t let a dog sign a warrant, why do we let them generate probable cause?
