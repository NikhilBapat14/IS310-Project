He had to shop around to find a district to win a House seat after failing at a run for Senate.  Dude has no chance of being elected governor.,-Poliwrath-,2025-04-07T17:30:05,1

Considering how the Michigan Democratic Party has been acting lately they’ll probably skip over gilchrist or Benson to run a 90 year old Reaganite neocon and then act shocked when they lose.,Single_Criticism9042,2025-04-07T17:24:01,1

"The Shelby Township Republican announced his entrance into the race Monday, April 7, saying Michiganders have been held back by a lack of strong and competent leadership.  James said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s time in office has been marked by “radical, out-of-touch policies that have hurt our families, our communities and our economy.” Whitmer, a Democrat, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in 2026.",mlivesocial,2025-04-07T17:18:11,1

"Let me fix that quote for him   ""Michiganders have been brought forward by strong and competent leadership. Whitmer's time in office has been marked by sensible, middle of the line policies, that have not hurt the poor or middle class enough. It is time for a candidate that can bring real change to the people who deserve it. The Rich. By aligning ourselves with the Trump agenda, we can bring back the Michigan of the 80s and line the pockets of Michigan's millionaires.""",Troub313,2025-04-07T17:23:55,1
"The same issue with a lot of other state parties right now, they’re struggling to adapt to the new political reality. Midwestern states are in a populist mood right now but a lot of state parties are controlled by long time staffers who have been there since the 90s and who struggle to adapt to the new mood. ",Single_Criticism9042,2025-04-07T17:30:44,1
"Whitmer had a +24 approval rating in a reputable state pollster just a week ago lmao     https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/04/02/president-trump-approval-ratings-michigan/82753609007/   ""Whitmer has 57% approval on her job performance, while 33% disapprove""   And thats after our state went Trump +1.3    There's quite a few people who voted Trump supporting her too...i have no idea who the best alternative would be...its looking like Benson solely due to name recognition but Detroits mayor might end up spoiling whoever ends up the candidate with how he is polling currently",blues111,2025-04-07T17:36:19,1

The amount of effort put into elevating slotkin in the pre-primary period is the biggest thing that comes to mind. There's a reason that she basically had no serious opposition in the primary and its because they made sure the field was cleared for her. Considering that she herself is essentially a 2000s republican it doesn't inspire confidence in the kind of candidates they pick. I think basically the only thing that saved her was that Rogers was also a really bad candidate and even then she only barely eeked out a victory. Against candidates like James who have wider popular appeal I don't think Slotkin-like candidates stand much of a chance.,Single_Criticism9042,2025-04-07T17:58:24,1
