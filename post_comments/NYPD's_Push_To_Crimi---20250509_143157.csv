Gotta love the NYPD they continue to innovate ways to make regular peoples life suck while stopping no crime.,JoeMorgan76,2025-05-09T14:39:43,16
"Two weeks ago, NYPD quietly began a policy shift, saying that it would begin hitting cyclists with criminal summonses instead of the typical traffic tickets. This means if you’re on a bike and you get caught breaking a traffic rule — like running a red light, riding on the sidewalk, or not yielding to a pedestrian — you will be ordered to appear in criminal court or risk an arrest warrant.   Streetsblog NYC's Sophia Lebowitz spoke to immigrant delivery workers, local politicians, and immigration lawyers about the chilling effect this has had on the city's workforce:  >“People think, okay this is America, there's due process for everything. But lately, the track record shows that sometimes there is not \[due process\] and there's nothing that people can do about it. \[Delivery workers\] are afraid of being that exception. They are afraid of being that person that the thing happens to.”  Read more: [https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/09/nypds-push-to-criminalize-cycling-spells-trouble-for-immigrant-workers](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/09/nypds-push-to-criminalize-cycling-spells-trouble-for-immigrant-workers)",streetsblognyc,2025-05-09T14:34:35,5

"From our [previous reporting](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/as-nypds-criminal-crackdown-on-cyclists-expands-it-grows-more-absurd-victims), NYPD's controversial [new strategy of criminalizing](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/02/policy-change-nypd-will-write-criminal-summonses-not-traffic-tickets-for-cyclists) low-level traffic offenses by cyclists and e-bike riders with court summonses has unleashed the worst instincts of individual cops, according to people who've received tickets — including one person who claims a cop clearly entrapped him.  One cyclist said that a cop deliberately stepped into the bike path, locked eyes with the him, then charged him with disorderly conduct and failing to yield to a pedestrian — the pedestrian being the cop himself.  Another rider got a criminal court summons on Sunday while riding along Broadway in Brooklyn, despite stopping for the red light, but the cop accused him of crossing the painted stop line.  Criminal summonses are not just being given for going through a red light -- they're being ginned up on the spot.
