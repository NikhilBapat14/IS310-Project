That was one of the goals. Wasn't it?,unserious-dude,2025-04-27T08:10:30,25
"Mission accomplished. To complete the trifecta they need to  destabilize education from daycare through college because education helped Blacks get to the middle class and end or destabilize the civil rights act, voting rights, justice & equality measures, and affirmative action (already gone).   They’re on track to kill it all by 2028 if not sooner.",xultar,2025-04-27T09:28:58,9
It’s not just the blacks. The middle class as a whole is utterly *fucked*. That was the point. It will be the 1% and the poors.,SuccessfulVisit1873,2025-04-27T11:36:32,8
The effect on the black middle class explains a lot about these firings.,FIlm2024,2025-04-27T12:28:24,3
"The black Community considered Federal Civil Service good jobs with good wages, health benefits and a retirement the private sector didn't provide.  That's why many went with Civil Service fair hiring and employee compensation practices.  The rest of America saw Civil Service as the opposite because government didn't pay as well as private sector.",OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-27T16:40:46,3
Black and Hispanic men had insane shifts to the right this past election. I guess you get what you voted for.,TDeath21,2025-04-27T08:27:58,1
"Obvious intention. I’d say he’s too stupid to figure it out like that, but he’s been consistent.",NEOK53,2025-04-27T19:25:51,1
Well white blue collar/working class workers hate when anyone does better than them especially when black people do better.,Antique-Echidna-1600,2025-04-27T08:28:04,8
"The 1 and the deeply divided, ""other"" hating poors who will happily police their own ""purity"" by hurting each other in sheer ignorance while the evil Directorate looks fondly from above. Apokalips with it's own fat, bulbous orange shitty Darkseid.",SolarDynasty,2025-04-28T05:35:26,1
They're still majority democratic populations and this civil service purge primarily affects women. It's not a helpful sentiment.,XXX_KimJongUn_XXX,2025-04-27T08:30:05,10
"And whites (men and women, young and old) are the largest demographic behind the fascist right movement",Infamous_Pay_7141,2025-04-27T09:01:30,7
"77% is greater than 50%, 44% (Latino men  and White women) and 38% (White men). I guess it makes sense that the majority of the country would elect a president that is just as innumerate as they are.",quaglady,2025-04-27T09:24:21,3
Tribalism at its finest.,SuccessfulVisit1873,2025-04-28T09:05:47,1
Sure are!,TDeath21,2025-04-27T12:25:46,1
Yeah. It’s also fair to point out when what has been a strong Democratic voting bloc for decades has a massive shift to the right it was likely the deciding factor.,TDeath21,2025-04-27T12:28:28,-2
"I'm going to need White Americans to admit their ""sucker"" problem is really bad. Concepts of a plan, a promise to crash the economy, the utter lawlessness shown in 1/6/2021 still carried the voting bloc which also also makes up 70% of the electorate. Any election with Trump as a candidate shouldn't have been close. White voters are why it was close. Getting upset voters of color didn't shield White voters from their own poor decision making (especially when few efforts were made to stop the erosion of voting rights that Black voters have been soundi g rhe alarm on since *Shelby County v Holder) is deliberately missing the point.",quaglady,2025-04-27T13:27:29,5
Great points.,LostTrisolarin,2025-04-27T19:26:33,3
Well yes white people are the largest voting bloc. All I’m saying is if Harris held the Biden numbers among minorities she’d have won. There wasn’t a cratering of support among white people. But there was among two specific groups. Hispanic males and black males. And that was the difference.,TDeath21,2025-04-27T17:55:55,-2
"Clinton had those numbers, she had a 3 million vote lead on Trump in 2016 and she did not win. Stop trying to grade White voters on a curve. Why is it acceptable for White voters to dig ditches and expect everyone else to fill them in? Why does it seem like there a deliberate effort to avoid understanding why a promise to crash the economy still won White voters?",quaglady,2025-04-27T18:14:01,3
"Well she did win but our out dated way we elect the President kept her from taking office. It’s not acceptable. There’s no excuse for voting for the convicted felon. The only point I’m making is that AFTER all he did post election loss in 2020, there were only two major groups he made huge gains with. It’s wild. He should have cratered support everywhere. Instead he held support among all other demographics and increased support among the two previously mentioned.",TDeath21,2025-04-27T18:58:49,-1
"President's aren't elected based on a ""delta"" they're elected based on the votes for that election. You're trying to grade White voters on a curve  even though reducing Trump support among White voters would have also led to a Harris vicotry. Why is everyone just supposed to accept that White voters seem to want to hold this country back, and why exactly are voters of color expected to always cover this up?",quaglady,2025-04-27T19:11:25,3
You’re trying soooo hard to make this a race thing and it’s super lame. It’s also super lame you immediately down vote me every single post I make. I’m not grading anyone on a curve. No excuse for anyone voting for him. The only point I’m making is his numbers went UP significantly with only two demographics post 2020 shenanigans and being a convicted felon. The white voters who have been with him the entire time are clearly deep in the cult and are not changing no matter what. But something DID change with the black male demographic and the Hispanic male demographic. Despite everything he did November 2020-November 2024. Why?,TDeath21,2025-04-27T19:29:10,0
"You want to know why it's a race thing for me? Because White voters sense of resignation is currently ruining them. Why are you so comfortable leaving White people who are admittedly in a cult in that cult? Its a race thing because my Black ass cannot BEGIN to comprehend this we've done nothing and we're just gonna give up attitude. I truly think Black Americans would be better off hunkering down through these four years is this is the ""help""  and ""partnership"" we can expect to get from our White countrymen. And if you want to know what the shift is, it's probably disillusionment (the same disillusionment felt by young White men but a whole 40 percentage points lower). Why believe in this country if these are your countrymen?",quaglady,2025-04-27T19:47:27,2
"Again, super lame to down vote every comment I make.  I’ve tried to get multiple people to leave the cult. I’ve been successful at some but it takes A LOT of work. And it’s unsustainable on a massive level. Only able to be done by someone they truly care about and on an individual level. The other thing that can work is when something directly affects them. People are selfish. They won’t care for instance until this administration deports someone they care about. Or cuts their job. Etc.   The other thing to remember is how ignorant politically most people are. Usually around 50% of eligible voters turn out for Presidential Elections. Less than 10% (estimate) of that 50% actually follow politics close enough to genuinely make an informed decision. People remember his first Presidency as things being pretty good until the pandemic. Because it was. He inherited an amazing economy from Obama and had literally no major tests till March of 2020, which he failed miserably. But people chalk that up to a once in a century pandemic. But then those same ignorant people blame the insane inflation following said pandemic on Democrats. We know, because we follow it close, how well it was handled, the best of any developed nation. They don’t. They’re ignorant. What % of voters do you think even know about the evidence in all the trials, of which, I’m sure you read them like I did, it’s some truly awful and terrible shit.  Yes unfortunately young white men have been brain washed by podcasts and the alternative media space. Numerous podcasts that aren’t strictly political have right wing undertones that push them to the right. It’s unfortunate the younger generation could have saved us from this administration but instead the young men have pushed hard right to negate the normal trend of young voters.",TDeath21,2025-04-27T20:58:24,0
