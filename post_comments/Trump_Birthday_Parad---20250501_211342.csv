"What’s the standard “loaded cost” for a US service member? Say it’s $250 total cost for each service member hour and say this parade uses up 10 hours of each members time in total, with planning, wardrobe, unplanned service changes/charges and the actual pre/post event.   So $2500 x $6000 = $15 million just in troops. So this will easily be a $25 million birthday celebration. Yay!😁",niktaeb9,2025-05-01T21:46:15,3

"Trump exited the DC hotel in 2022.  It was losing money.  The group that acquired it rebranded it as a Waldorf-Astoria.  It went into foreclosure in 2024.    The winner has been the US government, which still owns it.  It charges millions of dollars per year in lease payments, which is such a large nut to cover that it makes it impossible for anyone to make money on it.  Yet another example of Trump putting together a money loser.  This art of the deal stuff is complete BS.",I405CA,2025-05-01T21:46:00,13
