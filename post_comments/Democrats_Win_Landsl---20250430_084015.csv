However, 2008 I voted Obama and if I had voted in 2010 midterms, I may have voted Republican however, I watched Republicans in my state fuck me over personally and likely did not vote at all in 2010 midterms. Every election since I've been straight Blue.  So while it wasn't a complete non-vote for Dems when I stopped voting Republican, the switch took only a single election cycle.  There is an opportunity in Iowa. They didn't turn out because they're pissed at Trump and Republican policies, they're more likely to listen now and become future Dem voters.

My biggest fear is that Trump wrecks things initially but then there's either a plateau or a slow improvement. In that case, most conservative voters in 2026 aren't going to head to the ballot box comparing how things played out over the last 2 years compared to where they were trending, they're going to simply say ""it's not bad and a Democrat would be worse"" and vote Republican yet again.

Did the 2024 election share a ballot with the presidential election? Because if so that's a wildly unfair comparison. Presidential elections always have a massive boost in voter turnout.,NoBizlikeChloeBiz,2025-04-30T11:25:41,112
"Special elections generally have low turnout. The lower saliency of the election and the irregular timing don't help, and neither does the fact that a good portion happen in very safe districts (due to appointments/election to another office). And it's not just an American phenomenon. Look at by-election turnout in the UK or any country with election districts and you'll see drop-off.   The question has always been the alternative. Gubernatorial appointment doesn't guarantee someone who represents the district, and often isn't even required to be of the same party as the departing representative. Long-term vacancy is a terrible option as well.   Some would also argue that lower turnout isn't a bad thing in and of itself, particularly if it means fewer people voting who don't know anything about the candidates or positions. There's a long-standing reality that low propensity voters who vote in Presidential but not midterm or special elections are more likely to vote straight ticket or based on factors like gender and race than the high propensity voters who turnout in special elections, who pay more attention to policy positions. You certainly get odd outcomes in Specials you don't normally get in regular elections - think Scott Brown in Massachusetts or the Dem in the Iowa state house who flipped that Trump seat earlier this year. Because of low turnout, protest voting actually makes a difference.",TyranAmiros,2025-04-30T12:38:10,30
"> But maybe that is normal for special elections?  This right here.  Even midterms have lower turnout, and those are as high profile as you can get without an active presidential race.

If my husband wants to keep his relationship with her, it’s his choice but she’s no longer allowed in our home or to see our child.   And a lot of the aggression started over Trump.

"100% this.  I think a major pull of MAGA is a feeling of disconnection and wanting to feel like they belong somewhere. When the price of admission for that is basically ""be unhappy with the state of things and just desperately want to go back to a time when you're happy with your life"" and there's an easy target for who might be responsible, that's a pretty heavy pull.  I've said it for ages that, as hard as it might be, finding common ground with people who aren't dyed-in-the-wool racists and making an effort to connect on literally some level, is the way to help turn people back from the edge of the cliff. Saying ""f all the way off"" feels great in the moment, but it's ultimately pissing the bed. Feels great and warm doing it, but then you have to lie in it as it goes cold.

Ok so we have that much in common. What else might we have in common?"" is a super easy starting point.  And when things start falling apart, you can introduce the idea of ""y'know how things were objectively better before Mr Orange started making huge changes? Now we have that in common too. Doesn't mean you have to radically change your worldview or vote Dem or whatever, but let's accept things as they are and work hard to change things for the better.""

I talk to a lot of people who aren’t apathetic, they’re overwhelmed by the machine.  They feel like the system’s broken, like their vote doesn’t change much, especially locally where coverage is thin and candidates feel disconnected. That political exhaustion feeds into a broader question I’m hearing more often: “Do our political ideologies actually reflect our moral values anymore?”  So yeah, maybe turnout was always going to be low.

"Yeah information about if or when elections are happening can vary a lot state to state and area.   Like I am in NY. The beginning of April I got a small post card in the mail telling me the date of the primaries in June and the general elections in November.  There is no information on what will be on either ballot. There is just a small note that there might not be a primary for your party. They have also started post your party affiliation on that card completely visible postcard, which depending on area and housing situation can have its own concerns.  So right off the bat you need to make note of both dates and check what is on the ballots - which can be another hassle sometimes if you check ""too early"" for a sample ballot to be posted online.  I am in a purple ish area and local news swings right wing so most likely they will only mention the primary after it has happened and one small article when general early voting starts for the general. But this will never be a promoted or top story article.   Then any local only election is never on these cards and again the news will make one small post on election day that the election happened and then one post about results.   Like there has been no mention that there is an election May 20th for school district budgeting. Which includes the public library funding propositions. Luckily our school district does what every election should be doing is sending out a booklet that tells everything you will be voting on in detail and a breakdown of the budget you will be voting for.  But it is a weird special election that only runs from noon to 9pm with no early voting. Unlike normal elections that have either 10 or 14 days of early voting and day of polls 6 am to 10 pm. This election again most likely will only be mentioned by the news - day before best case, worst case day of and then again when results are in.  End of a giant rant.

"I honestly can't agree with you on this simply because these people will never admit it was a mistake. They'll never reconsider anything. And I'm not saying that hyperbolically or unfairly, I'm saying it based off of what I've experienced from many Trump voters throughout their lives.  My former best friend voted for Trump (at least in 2016 which is about when I cut all contact with him). Prior to that he went to college, took out $100k in loans his first semester, and blew it all by the start of the 2nd semester. He dropped out. Then he bought a car, got underwater on it, but his parents bailed him out before it was repossessed. Then he bought a house. That was too much for his parents to bail him out, so that ultimately was foreclosed on. Now any sane person here would look at that and say he's not financially responsible, but not him. None of that was his fault in his mind. It was the banks that screwed him.  Another former friend that voted for Trump went down the Q rabbit hole. Bought into all the health bullshit. He's 37 and was just in a 3 day coma after being found unconscious by a relative. Now he's buying into all the alternative health shit even harder!  I'm from a very conservative area and could write about dozens of people that all exhibit the exact same behavior, time and again failing to learn from their mistakes or even admit their fault. People with 4+ DUIs, never once their fault for driving while over the limit but always on the bartender for making their drinks too strong or the cops for setting them up.  I'm over being tolerant of them and their mistakes. Not because we shouldn't afford people grace to improve and learn, but because these people have a history of behavior that already shows they don't. A first time voter that voted for Trump because they believed the campaign promises? Sure, give them grace. But a three time Trump voter that is now playing the victim because they lost their job and their government support? Nope, they're not going to learn shit. They're going to continue claiming everyone else is stealing *their* welfare and blaming illegals and anyone else that gets offered up as a scapegoat for their problems.",porscheblack,2025-04-30T11:09:31,23

"Grace is a thing in such short supply, but your average Republican and average Democrat have a whole helluva lot more in common with each other than they do with their representatives, whoever those representatives might be. They're paying the same utilities, shopping at the same stores, waiting to pick up their kids from school in the same lines, dealing with the same natural disasters, side-by-side, while their representatives grandstand.  I can totally empathize with anyone on any side of the aisle that feels their voices are lost and their time and efforts are wasted in trying to affect any meaningful change on the direction of their lives through lobbying the people in power who are too rich to give a fuck.  Which is why I will shout it from the rooftops - now is the time to embrace your neighbors; help them, help your community. Give your time (and if you can, give your money) to charities, to food banks, to the people in your community that care about you and care about each other.   Human beings have a lot of detestable qualities, but we still have some good ones. And being decent and kind to each other in the face of collective adversity, banding together, that's one of them. There are far more good people in this world than bad. If there weren't, we wouldn't have made it this far.

">Yes, thank you, I do not understand how so many people here (on Reddit I mean) just cannot muster one ounce understanding for Trump voters. I'm not saying empathy or forgiveness.

It was in Ads. It was talked about endlessly.  And not just the economy either. Everything going on right now.  I'm sorry, but I'm not quite so sure we should give them such an easy out. Because of their (If you believe them) uninformed voting, we now have our allies around the world turning their backs to us, our economy is tanking, we're on the brink of having the military in our streets acting as police, judges are under attack, the first amendment is constantly violated, and citizens and legal residents are being deported to brutal foreign prisons.

"Yes, Trump proved that the rank-and-file republican base wants pro-worker and economic populist policies. There is a profound sense of alienation with the establishment, and they want someone who is willing to fight it. They ate up these policies and projected them on Trump, whether he agrees with them or not. The big difference is that Trump has an R next to his name. They think voting republican is a moral imperative, just like how they would vote to make the ten commandments law despite them being the most likely to break them. They see it as a virtuous ideal. The democratic brand is tainted to these folks. Voting democrat is a betrayal on par with Judas' betrayal. This is why ranked choice or vocally anti-establishment democrats or, ideally, independents could capture a lot of this demographic that would never vote democrat, but want a democratic republican. If you read a lot of disillusioned Trump voters, they generally say they wish they didn't vote at all.

"Apathy may be achievable. Convincing them to vote for a Democrat after literally half or more of their lifetimes they've been told they are the devil, it's just not happening. And I'm willing to quietly let them be apathetic for now, but I will straight up never forgive or forget the way they acted.   If someone voted for Trump in 2016, they're an idiot, but I get it, they were dissatisfied with Federal politics and wanted an outsider, they were just very stupid about the one they chose.   If they voted for Trump in 2020, they can be forgiven if they're truly torn up about it, but their level of stupidity cannot be forgotten and must always be accounted for. Even if Trump eventually dies off and this person attempting to re-enter the fold, it's important to always be wary because they've demonstrated such a monumental lack of critical thinking skills that they simply can't be trusted to use actual logic to reach conclusions that aren't wildly dangerous to themselves and others.   If they voted for Trump in 2024, they can go and fuck themselves. I will never forgive or forget their actions, they knew exactly what horrors they were voting for, and I don't give the slightest shit what lies they cloak that in about egg prices or COVID conspiracies or American prestige; our citizens and residents are being abused by a malignant narcissist enabled by these people, and our country will literally never recover because of their deep lack of morals, ethics, or critical thinking. I consider them either a fascist or fascist enabler, and while I'm fine with them apathetically choosing not to vote after realizing what a complete idiot they are, I don't ever want to associate with them in any context ever again. I don't wish for them to die, but the country and the people therein would literally be better off if they had never existed.  I see what you're saying about catching more flies with honey, but Conservatives and Reactionaries have been given so many passes for almost two centuries at this point that it has to end somewhere. Over and over and over they have dragged this country into the shit and then suffered far too few consequences- Civil War traitors rebelling because they wanted to own people got blanket clemency, KKK lynching people and getting covered for by the cops and the community, homegrown nazis marching en masse to attempt to get the US to join WWII on the Axis side, the list of malfeasants goes on and on and on the list of repercussions grows distressingly short.",Ferelar,2025-04-30T12:04:40,13
