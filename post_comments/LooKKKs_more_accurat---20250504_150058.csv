"I still find it funny that he only has one finger up instead of 3 (as even his thumb is folded in).

"Please stop obsessing about his memes. You are giving him exactly what he wants.  You realize trump laughs at you because of this, right? He's doing a fascist take over of the country and you sit here and enable him by reposting his bullshit to distract everyone from those facts.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-04T16:40:17,12

"I find it hilarious that both sides use AI for memes, but if you post a comment on the republican subreddit saying ""People should be worried about people believing AI"" they ban you. They call democrats snowflakes when they melt faster than a mozzarella ball in hell. And to think poor Melania is literally running a platform trying to ban the use of AI generated revenge porn. 😅 Make it make sense.",Pizza_Witch_,2025-05-04T16:43:44,4

">Instead of showing the ""3"" for the Holy Trinity, he shows ""1"" for himself, the holy shit.  Fun fact, the Russian Orthodox Church had a schism related to (among other things) whether the sign of the cross should be made with two or three fingers. It was really more about whether to unify Russian and Greek orthodox practices or not, but at the time, people were burned alive for using the 'wrong' number of fingers.  (On second thought, that fact isn't very fun at all).",AssiduousLayabout,2025-05-04T19:47:33,5
