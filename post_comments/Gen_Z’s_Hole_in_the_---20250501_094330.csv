Have they tried shifting even more rightward? I’m sure that will work out swimmingly for them.,alien88,2025-05-01T09:49:48,24

"I think many of them could have very well voted for their own 2008 financial crisis to start adulthood with.  It's probably one of the biggest reasons millennials are so liberal, and could definitely impact Gen z going forward.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T09:55:06,20
Gen z was made far right by tik tok and YouTube influencers like Andrew Tate and other idiots. ,SuperRayGun666,2025-05-01T10:10:21,15
"I agree, we’ll see if they learn.",alien88,2025-05-01T10:06:17,1
What does that have to do with them changing their positions because reality hits them on the face. Andrew Tate can't pay their bills or fix the job market if Trump completely destroys the economy which looks likely.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T10:15:17,4
Because gen z is broken.  They don’t have the attention span required for actual critical thought.  They learned politics off tik tok and YouTube shorts.  These were led by influencers who are most likely paid by Trump and Russia and other bad actors or farming on outrage.   So we have and had all these young minds molded by literal fascists and they don’t know any better.    I still remember the budget cuts conservatives made to education and special programs when I was a kid.    I remember when conservatives cut the funding for my science based job out of college.  I remember the housing crisis that started under conservatives. I remember the mishandling of the pandemic by conservatives.   They have done everything they could to screw millennials.  ,SuperRayGun666,2025-05-01T10:20:01,7
"You still didn't address how becoming adults during an economic crisis will reshape them. Look, I enjoy shitting on Gen z as much as the next person. As evidenced by your comment, it's pretty much America's pastime to shit on those younger than us.  I would just remind you that people said very similar things about millennials.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T10:23:20,-5
Unlike all the millennials who got their politics from Jon Stewart’s comedy show?,AgnusNonDeus,2025-05-01T13:14:33,-1
"More expensive Xboxes doesn’t make an economic crisis.  Gen Z has been utterly failed. Their education is awful. Discipline in schools has effectively been outlawed. There has been nothing to counter the diseased crap they consume all day long on social media. Most teachers have given up on even getting them to read a single book. The pandemic and post-2008 normalized living at home while giving them less supervision from parents who were forced to work longer hours at lower pay. And they are the most entitled generation yet.  Look at some of their answers- “don’t have time” and “don’t know where to look” are common answers to why they don’t have jobs. They HAVE time. They’re fucking unemployed! They can figure this shit out with goddamned Google. Many just don’t WANT to work in an economy that has had very low unemployment.  They have been failed at every turn by Boomers and Gen X. But now they have to stand the fuck up on their own, no matter how diseased their culture and upbringing is. They are not facing their own economic crisis, and all signs suggest it wouldn’t change much if they did.",Hello2reddit,2025-05-01T10:41:09,2
"I’m not American. I don’t identify as American. I do not enjoy shitting on gen z.  For a good moment they would have been the chosen ones with the greatest access to information and could have led generational change with two generations mainly leaning liberal, democrat.  ",SuperRayGun666,2025-05-01T10:35:26,0
As a college grad millennial I can tell you I took civic classes and get my political information from news  from multiple sources as to not create a bias. ,SuperRayGun666,2025-05-01T17:25:05,1
"You don't enjoy shitting on them? Come on dude just look at your comments. It's like you think their views are set forever, they are very young. You won't even entertain the idea that they are still in their formative years. Also calling them the chosen ones is pretty weird.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T10:37:31,1
I thought with all the technology and information they would be liberal democrat leaning.   However they seemed to become the new generation of boomers.   They helped elected Donald Trump.     Like anakin helping palpatine ,SuperRayGun666,2025-05-01T10:44:38,0
