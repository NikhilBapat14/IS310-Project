"Quote: Along with its constitutional arguments, law firm Perkins Coie wielded another powerful weapon in its legal battle with President Donald Trump: his own commentary spanning eight years.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-07T02:26:25,9
"I'm the SMARTEST person I know. Even the lawyers were saying SIR you are so SMART you should have been the CHIEF SUPREME on the Supreme Court. Can you believe that? But I told him I'M TOO BUSY MAKING DEALS. I made 90 deals in 90 days, and then I made 25 deals in 25 days. Even today, I had the president of Canada Marc Carrey in the White House BEGGING ME to BUY CANADA, and I told him NO DEAL.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-07T02:52:36,11
"Trump has a habit of just talking too much and saying things that end up being used against him. If you look at a lot of his legal issues, his own statements or tweets get brought up in court. Lawyers love that because it makes their job easier. With Perkins Coie, I think it was the same deal stuff he said basically made their case for them. It’s kind of wild how often that happens with him.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-07T05:40:08,3
Hopefully retaliation against free speech is picked up as a line of precedent in plenty of other cases. Perfect against a man driven by retribution and can't stop talking about it.,steve_ample,2025-05-07T04:38:42,2
Other firms bending to Trump in *any* way *is* capitulation. To say otherwise is gaslighting and philosophically untrue to maintain one’s ethics and then kowtow to Trump’s demands to curtail said ethics.,truePHYSX,2025-05-07T11:06:29,2

"Bigly. Remember when Marc Carrey was on Saturday Night Live? So funny with that Fire Marshal Paul bit. Live from New York, I love New York. I love Newark. Why was there never an ""I love Newark"" ad campaign. Great airport.",jonsca,2025-05-07T03:36:17,3
