Weâ€™ve been in a constitutional crisis since day one of his presidency,MrAlek360,2025-03-31T21:29:20,36
"No shit, what the hell does this phrase even mean? Sure seems like an insurrection by a sitting president who then is subsequently allowed to re-take office may be a constitutional crisis. Or maybe that was a constitionial hubub.",Fartron69,2025-03-31T21:40:40,12

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html   They are at least claiming this was done under traditional deportation procedures and the majority were actually Salvadorans. The actual process used is unclear but at least they are trying to not appear to violate the court order.,handsoapdispenser,2025-03-31T22:10:07,3

PBS: oh this is just how those naughty boys in DC get on.  It is normal. Everything is fine. Here's a fluff piece on a guy who carves statues with a machete.  Trump Administration: We will but public broadcasting funding.  PBS: Oh no! It's a constitutional crisis!!!,One_Abalone1135,2025-04-01T09:17:38,-2
"As usual, the PBS headline buries the lede. It should say outright that the Trump administration is defying court orders and flouting the fucking Constitution. Every legacy media outlet is treating this with kid gloves, while they couldnâ€™t stop talking about Bidenâ€™s age every fucking hour of the day.  Canâ€™t anyone just blatantly call this what it is?",Excellent_Pirate8224,2025-04-01T07:03:46,7

"A constitutional crisis is when one branch of government ignores another branch of government. We have 3 branches.  Executive, legislative, judicial.  Executive is ignoring judicial and, by the way, threatening judges whose rulings they donâ€™t like. This is my understanding of a constitutional crisis.",morenci-girl,2025-04-01T09:51:57,2
"When on branch of government, in this case executive, ignores another branch of government, in this case judicial, that is a constitutional crisis. This is exactly whatâ€™s happening now. Donâ€™t kid yourself.  Our democracy can very easily be lost in favor of authoritarianism, a dictatorship.",morenci-girl,2025-04-01T09:48:21,5
Good question.  I think the media is afraid to call it out in a headline.,morenci-girl,2025-04-01T09:50:03,2
