"Apparently some actor who is into him met with him (John Voight https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/trump-tariff-hollywood-movies.html), and following that meeting Trump made that announcement. Understanding Trump’s random acts often requires looking at who was last in his ear.    If someone can argue a position well, and appeals to Trump’s ego, they will get what they want. Trump is not going to assign the matter to staff for research,  get the pro’s and cons, he’s going to make a knee jerk decision, probably to demonstrate how he alone can fix things. Of course most of his stuff ends up blowing up in his face because he doesn’t make informed decisions.  We have so many talented people in this country, yet we seem to put the people least qualified into power.  We need to take a hard look at what our problem is!",[deleted],2025-05-07T05:04:22,42

Trump has withdrawn from NATO and has antagonized the US' closest allies, like Canada, Mexico, and the EU.

He is attacking universities for allowing dissent. He is attacking the courts and Congress to stifle their resistance. He wants to delegitimize the US election system. This is in line with his goal of being a dictator.

"I think it's pretty obvious to anyone that isn't just blinded by Trump rage. All the tariffs are part of a general raising of the stakes for countries that want to do business with the US. By raising the stakes now, you provide more leverage for negotiation later.   Foreign films might not be a huge piece of the puzzle but it is another stone on the pile. If you're India or the UK where your film industry considers the US to be a significant market then you will be hoping to resolve this issue. And when the US is discussing a rebalanced trade arrangement with you, your film industry's access to the US market will be one of the factors.",mskmagic,2025-05-07T04:04:48,-12

"Genuinely I think people are responding negatively to this purely because it's coming from Trump. The workers who work below the line crew jobs on film/TV productions in California and Georgia are struggling, and they have been struggling for awhile. More and more productions are moving to Canada, the UK, and elsewhere because of tax incentives given out by those governments to bring American productions there, and these American, largely blue-collar and working-class, people are becoming unemployed because of it. These are people with families who have been out of work for years and are having really difficult times.  These decisions by studio heads to move overseas have been entirely cost-cutting moves to keep their personal profits and revenue high, and the decisions are made at the expense of the working-class people who are vital to every production. Labor unions who represent these workers are already responding positively to these suggestions because they see this as the first potential sign to their conditions somewhat improving, it is a good thing. So just remember that when you come out defending studios sending everything overseas, what you're doing is defending corporations and studio executives lining their pockets at the expense of the working-class.  There is a lot of the discussion that is going on that is pretty nonsensical. No, there is no point to tariffing movies that are made by foreign countries because these jobs were never going to be American to begin with. And no, American productions that are filmed overseas for the specific purpose of using that location, those should not be tariffed either. But when American studios send their productions overseas just to shoot on sound stages because the production costs are cheaper, there absolutely should be more done to keep them here. This is an issue that has been plaguing the American film and TV industry for many years and it is only getting worse. Power in Hollywood has always been held by the celebrities and the executives, but this is an issue that is only hurting the working-class laborers who hold the absolute least power, they need someone to stand up for them.",lionhearted318,2025-05-07T22:55:14,-1

"John Voight was not the first actor to express concerns. I heard a similar conversation on the Rob Lowe podcast with Adam Scott (Severance star) about the cost of filming in the US. Many production companies are filming abroad in other countries such as Ireland because it is more cost effective and due to the tax incentives. They indicated that is we cheaper to take the cast and crew to another country to film than it was to do the same thing in America. Maybe tariffs aren’t the right answer. But, it should get the conversation started on how to produce more films in the US.",Ok-Cardiologist2109,2025-05-08T13:32:04,2

"It is my understanding that a lot of shows are filmed in Canada for multiple reasons. The first, and most obvious, is the Canadian governments tax structures for film crews are much friendlier than the United States. Canada also has significantly lower population density for most of the country, this gives film crews a lot more control over their environment and film schedule. And for some shows, it's just the atmosphere.

"But why ""fight"" that? The movies are still being made by American companies. The people they hire are largely temporary or ""gig"" workers, so it's not a massive jobs incentive. Although movies are expensive to make, a lot of municipalities lure them to film locally with tax breaks, so it's not about government revenue.

Even US based filming is more likely to happen in FL.   The CoL in Cali and the huge markets of actors, support staff, and talent has created such competition for the studios that they can really charge whatever they want to filming space. Even a single day of renting studio space at WB is ungodly.  I can fly my staff and actors to a studio anywhere that isn’t California for cheaper, even Universal. Makeup, support, and studios are prohibitively expensive. Compounded with lower box office sales and streaming companies eating into profits, America is over charging itself.  The only real solution is to lower CoL through regulation. But doubtful it will happen; companies  asked to make something cheaper doesn’t usually happen.

"This demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of how business operates.   For example, If Unilever only makes $62 billion in profit next year instead of the $65 billion they made in 2024, then heads will roll. Share values will plummet. Markets will react.

I never said India is desperate to break into the US film market. I was pointing out that *any* drop in revenue is a major problem for big businesses, for whole industries, and for the governments that host those industries.  So yes, it's leverage.

And you would have a point except the US is the biggest market for all of those companies, and Trump is obstinate.  Once again, India has a population of 1.4 billion people.  The US has a population of 340 million.  One of the *first* things a US based production company will do before they start spending money on production is find international distributors willing to join them on distribution, referred to as ""foreign presales"".  All those big budget hollywood blockbusters?  Presales.  They're lined up with international distribution before filming *ever* begins, because international markets are *that* important.  The world has eight billion people.  The US has 340 million.  If you want to *cripple* Hollywood's revenue, you target their ability to reach international markets.",zaoldyeck,2025-05-07T13:30:47,2

"I never said that he was. I don't think he cares about them at all. But we don't need to oppose policy that *would help them* simply because of the person proposing it. A broken clock is right twice a day. I presume he more so probably wants to punish studio heads, which he thinks are opposed to him, while also demonstrating American dominance over foreign nations, but his personal rationale is not relevant if the overall outcome is going to be good. These working-class people need help and this may actually help them.  But many blue-collar laborers do tend to be Trump sympathetic so I also wouldn't be shocked if this is somewhat in exchange for the support he's suddenly getting from labor unions. He appointed a pro-labor Secretary of Labor which was a pretty shocking turnaround compared to previous Republican presidents' approach to the Department of Labor. Not saying he's a pro-labor god or anything like that, of course not, but laborers make up a decent chunk of his base so it's also not outside of the realm of possibility that he wants to continue to appeal to them a bit.",lionhearted318,2025-05-08T10:57:07,1
"I know how many people India has. I'm Indian. India is probably a bad example for Hollywood films because very few people watch them in the cinema - Bollywood dominates there obviously. But I take your point about Hollywood movies abroad in general and of course there will be pain felt by US companies exporting to foreign countries that apply a reciprocal tariff. But the US is the major consumer market for foreign goods. India will feel a tariff on their exports to the US more than the other way round and Trump is playing a game of who will blink first.   Take China as another example. China exports a lot to the US and could be doing much much more. So US tariffs on their goods have a huge effect. China buys very little from the US so their tariffs on US imports affect relatively few businesses.  In most cases the other country will blink first and Trump will be able to negotiate a favourable trade deal. But that is only because he first raised the stakes. Trying to negotiate a better deal when the other side already has one is never likely to work. That's the whole point of the tariffs, and if extra revenue is collected in the meantime then all the better.",mskmagic,2025-05-07T16:52:26,0
"I mean he literally released a book describing the negotiating tactics he's currently deploying.   But I think you're highlighting the problem with these forums. No reasonable conversation can be had because liberals are blinded by Trump's personality. The view of democrats is 'Trump is stupid so everything he does is wrong'. This low quality view is the reason that Dems end up in ridiculous positions like supporting illegal immigration, or not wanting reduction of government waste - simply being against Trump is apparently more important. Evidently more people in the country trust Trump to run things than anything the DNC can offer.  Here's an idea - why don't you try to steel-man Trump's policy?  It might give you an insight into the aims of the government with regard to tariffs. Because trying to convince people that Trump is just stupid and everything he does is just random, makes *you guys* the ones who are trying to manipulate people with low IQ.",mskmagic,2025-05-07T11:46:08,0

">A book he didn't write and likely has not read.  Irrelevant. It describes his negotiating tactics. He hasn't changed how he operates, and is open about it, so I'm not sure why liberals keep getting confused about what he's doing?  >You're making broad generalizations about at least 1/3 of the political spectrum, and you're pretending they all think exactly alike? But you're not the one being irrationally emotional?  You're being disingenuous. As an individual you might not personally agree that men can become women, or that DoGE is doing something wrong, or that illegal immigrants shouldn't necessarily be deported. But those ideas characterise the views of Democrat supporters and the liberal movement. Generally people who think those ideas are batshit crazy voted for Trump. In fact most people were given no choice but to vote Trump exactly *because* the liberals support such crazy ideas.  >Nobody is supporting illegal immigration  Not wanting illegal immigrants to be deported encourages people to.come to the country illegally.   >What DOGE is doing is not efficient, not saving money and has nothing to do with budgets.   So Biden did exactly zero to stop wasting taxpayer funds (actually he gave hundreds of billions away to support foreign wars) but now that Trump is tackling that issue and HAS cut hundreds of billions in waste - your side is complaining. It makes the left seem petty and misguided.   >I said I have seen no evidence that Donald Trump is capable of the kind of strategic thinking you are giving him credit for.

"The book you brought up is irrelevant? You know what ""negotiating tactics"" Trump is using because... he says so? Every other country in the world is denying having any talks with him, but he says so, and you accept ""trust me bro"" as a demonstration of fact? For some reason I don't share your reliance on Trump's veracity.  Nobody objects to illegal immigrants being deported, or Obama and Biden would have been wildly unpopular Presidents.

There is zero evidence that *""Trump is tackling that issue and HAS cut hundreds of billions of waste...""* That's just idiot spin. Elon Musk promised 1 trillion in savings. Then he lowered it to 500 billion. Now he's claiming that he has cut 150 billion, but the accounting keeps showing errors, exaggerations and lies. On top of that, thousands of improperly fired Federal employees are involved in class actions lawsuits that will likely cost the government billions more. You're only taking Trump and Elon Musks word that anything productive has been done, while tens of thousands have been put out of work and essential support programs like Meals on Wheels, the VA, the National Parks and necessary medical research have all been eliminated... for what?

But it's your repeated insistence in this thread that people who don't agree with you are not worthy of your respect, or to be taken seriously, that really intrigues me.

">You know what ""negotiating tactics"" Trump is using because... he says so? Every other country in the world is denying having any talks with him, but he says so, and you accept ""trust me bro"" as a demonstration of fact? For some reason I don't share your reliance on Trump's veracity.  The UK announced their trade deal with the US today. Earlier in the week he was talking to Carney at the Whitehouse about trade. What are you talking about?  >Nobody objects to illegal immigrants being deported, or Obama and Biden would have been wildly unpopular Presidents. It's almost like you don't understand the actual issues at hand, and can only parrot FOX News talking points? Or you do, and you're being openly dishonest?  Biden let in 11 million and then tried to pretend the numbers were down by letting them apply for asylum through an app. There's a reason illegal immigration is out of control in the US and it's because democrats have made it an attractive prospect. The issue at hand is only a legal technicality. Trump says that illegal immigrants who commit further crime whilst in the US, or are deemed members of a criminal gang should be deported under the alien enemies act - that means they don't get due process. The fact that Dems are so hung up on keeping gang members on US streets is far more worrying than the idea that Trump wants to deport people who aren't supposed to be here without a court stifling his progress.  >There is zero evidence that *""Trump is tackling that issue and HAS cut hundreds of billions of waste...""* That's just idiot spin.  The problem is that you refuse to believe anything the government says so you then pretend nothing has been done. DoGE regularly updated on the programs that were stopping and the waste they identified. But you call them liars. The President has detailed billions in savings but you call him a liar. When it was Biden you believed every word of bullshit, but now you think it's ok to say everything is untrue simply because you don't like who is saying it. Bad faith all the way. Add to that that the Dems launch legal challenges to stifle the efficiency changes at every step and it's clear which party prefers to rag on Trump rather than improve the country.   >You're only taking Trump and Elon Musks word that anything productive has been done,  Yeah that's the President and the guy who was in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency. Literally the highest authority sources possible.  >while tens of thousands have been put out of work  That's not saving taxpayer funds? I think you're contradicting yourself.   >essential support programs like Meals on Wheels, the VA, the National Parks and necessary medical research have all been eliminated...  Lies about the VA and meals on wheels. National parks and research funding was only paused for assessment. No point in finding out money is being wasted if you let it all get wasted first. Jesus, even democrat methodology is inefficient.  >for what? Tax breaks for the wealthy? You really imagine there's going to be a ""DOGE Dividend""?  More liberal bullshit designed to mislead. Proposed tax breaks are for everyone. If you earn more then of course you gain more from a tax break - that's how taxes work. A more honest way to put it would be that the money saved in tax cuts for the poorest affects them more. But you only like to use the other side of the coin - tax increases on everyone hit the poorest hardest. See the hypocrisy? As for a dividend we'll see - it's pretty sour how you don't want good things to happen because Trump suggested them.  >Ironic. The same people who spent the last 5-6 years insisting Biden was too old and addled with dementia to be President, despite him beating Trump and getting elected President, are now insisting that Trump being elected President is proof that he's smart and a strategic thinker? And you don't see the obvious contradiction in these beliefs?  No contradiction and no irony. Biden spent more than 30 years ruthlessly serving corporate elites to climb the power ladder - that takes strategy. He got the top job - that takes strategy. He got dementia - that's a shame. He hid it and so did everyone around him and then gaslit people that he was fine whilst he spoke gibberish and wandered around aimlessly - that is corruption of the office and disrespect to everyone in the country.",mskmagic,2025-05-08T13:24:13,-1
