Isnâ€™t that unconstitutional?,Ask4MD,2025-05-06T11:01:00,26
"The way they worded their letter makes clear they're all aware of their collective perils under the Logan Act if they materially try to interfere with federal tariff policy.  The comments Newsome made a few weeks back are actually more egregious than these.  That said, I'm pretty sure these governors don't want to become a test case for this SCOTUS to get a case law level argument like this...especially after the last administration's DOJ released a memo right before Trump's 2nd inauguration saying the DOJ considers the Logan Act constitutional until declared otherwise.  This is showboating for their constituents and nothing more.  By contrast, did anyone catch [this speech last night by the premier of Alberta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjgWM2dAOx0)?  I watched the entire thing and damned if it doesn't look like Canada's version of a states' rights argument on their hands.  Pretty strong stuff and it'll be awfully interesting to see how their new PM responds.  The TL/DR version is that she warns her federal counterparts that they better dismantle the legislation aimed at holding Alberta down or she'll allow her citizens to collect enough signatures to put a separation measure (their version of secession) on a referendum ballot that she will allow to go through.  They had years of Quebec threatening to split but this feels entirely different.  Quebec couldn't survive without the rest of the country.  Alberta, on the other hand, might actually be better off.",Euroranger,2025-05-06T12:42:15,4
