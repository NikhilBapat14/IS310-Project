The term “invasion” is necessary for suspending Habeus Corpus per the constitution. So this is setting the stage.,Birdman330,2025-05-10T10:31:25,132
"Historical note:  President Trump’s ""Project Homecoming"" leans heavily on the language of invasion and crisis—terms designed to stoke fear and justify extraordinary executive action. This perceived emergency, however, is one that Trump himself worked to inflame by discouraging Congressional Republicans from engaging in comprehensive immigration reform during the Biden administration. In doing so, he laid the groundwork for his own sweeping proclamation, cementing his narrative of chaos and instability at the border while setting the stage for consolidation of power under the guise of national security. The deputization of 20,000 ICE agents and the use of asset seizure to coerce voluntary deportation signal a shift toward federal overreach, echoing authoritarian tactics seen throughout history.   https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-project-homecoming/   Lead Lines:  Over the last 4 years, the United States has endured a full-scale invasion of aliens entering and remaining in the country illegally, causing a relentless onslaught of crime, vagrancy, violence, and death in countless American communities.  This lawless invasion has also limited the capacity of American schools and hospitals to provide for American citizens and has diverted billions of dollars in Federal, State, and local social services from Americans in need.  The continued presence of illegal aliens in our Nation forces American taxpayers to bear a tremendous fiscal burden to support them, including through costs related to healthcare, food stamps, public housing, emergency medical services, education, and shelter, as well as the costs of crimes committed by illegal aliens.  In Fiscal Year 2023 alone, these costs were estimated to exceed $150 billion in taxpayer dollars.  Removal flights of illegal aliens are a necessary aspect of immigration enforcement and upholding the rule of law, but they require substantial resources and manpower.  Therefore, the provision of financial incentives to encourage and assist aliens illegally in the country to elect to depart from the United States has the potential to save tremendous taxpayer resources, while restoring the sovereignty of our country.",D-R-AZ,2025-05-10T10:11:09,43

"""In Fiscal Year 2023 alone, these costs were estimated to exceed $150 billion in taxpayer dollars.""   Sooo $150 billion is a lot to spend on services but ~$100 billion is fine for a parade? When people start talking about large numbers their brains shut off... Compared to GDP what's the percent? 0.576923076923%... oh and services are paid by taxes which immigrants themselves pay into generally speaking  At the end of the day being bad at math has been the long-term failing of our country",Advanced_Feeling6105,2025-05-10T13:44:29,7

Trump is mad that Zelensky doesn’t have elections because he’s in a war with Russia.  Countries don’t have elections when they’re at war. He doesn’t seem to understand how elections work so now he wants to fabricate a crisis in America. He’s gonna claim a war so he can stay in power with no elections.,bapeach-,2025-05-10T14:52:12,1
"One of the things I hate about Trump is how he causes a fuss about imaginary problems. Even with increased immigration, there has never been an ""immigration crisis"". No one's livelihood is so severely impacted by immigration that it has led them to financial or psychological sufffering. There is no illegal immigrant crime epidemic either; crime overall is on a massive downturn and the majority of crimes committed in America are by American citizens.   Trump has successfully convinced his base that America's major issues are caused by illegal immigration, and this constitutes an ""invasion"".  As the resistance and rebellion against Trump ramps up, and intensifies, eventually Trump will regard this an ""insurrection"" and call for the immediate activation of the military onto public areas, essentially instating martial law.   Folks be prepared. This summer is gonna be ugly.",SapToFiction,2025-05-10T12:52:13,32

"Even if we were there's no constitutional provisions for suspending elections. Further, states hold elections, states elect representatives, and states send the delegation to the house. People forget that the constitution is a contract. Outright refusing to honor mid term election results from blue states is a guaranteed catalyst for civil war.  We had elections during ww2.

"There are no constitutional provisions either for sending people involuntarily to countries with which they have no association at the expense of taxpayers.   There are plenty of states who fall over to do whatever he wants. If he asked them not to do elections, are you really confident those states’ leadership and his maggot base wouldn’t willingly comply? There is already majority support for him doing a third term among maggots, are you truly that confident his base at that point would oppose just not having elections at all?   A civil war is literally what an alarming portion of his base wants, so your suggestion that not doing elections may cause one isn’t much of a deterrent.",KindlyComfortable744,2025-05-10T14:04:54,2

"You’re still giving room for doubt that the maggot states wouldn’t readily comply, and I don’t understand your basis for thinking they wouldn’t at this point.   You mentioned a civil war initially as if it that would serve as some sort of deterrent to them not having elections then agreed with me that they’d readily allow a civil war.   I don’t think highlighting how the constitution is just a contract between states and the federal government helps clarify the situation when several parties of the contract are blatantly not abiding by it (and the other sides claim the same) and the entities in place to enforce compliance with the contract have been shown unable to do so  Sorry but I think you’re assuming too much logic, decency, and respect for the country on their part.",KindlyComfortable744,2025-05-10T17:12:14,1
