He should make a power move and raise interest rates.   Trump only understands power now.   Send a message to that diapered dope!,KingBooRadley,2025-05-08T10:03:27,11

"Nah, they would be suppressed until the only resistance flees abroad. The Democrat leaders would suppress any uprising as well, because to them the most effective way to combat fascism is to write a sharp-worded letter",GatorNator83,2025-05-08T10:22:52,1
