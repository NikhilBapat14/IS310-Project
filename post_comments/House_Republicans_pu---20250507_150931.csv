"So, tax cuts for the rich who will then buy the land. They can literally leave the taxes as they are and just give the land to the oligarchs for free. It's effectively the same.  Your goverment is handing out public land to the billionaires for free.",QuantumWire,2025-05-07T15:30:26,31

"A notice to corporations who buy it:  When we get power back I will fully support the government using all legal force and authority to retake those lands. To retake them, charge you for the damages, and seize your own personal and company property to pay for it as needed.

Documentary - The Grab… they showed A relative of Betsy DeVos sees water as the next limited resource.  Buying land all over the world with water rights (sometimes stealing land)…   Capitalism… wonder how much water will cost as the climate change (that is not happening /s) gets worse and food won’t grow for corporate farms.  Of course - republicans want the land… who needs parks when there is money to be made?,Ugh-screen-name,2025-05-07T15:18:02,13

"I'm okay with this under one condition:  Those lands are sold with the express knowledge and agreement that the NEXT administration (or any future one) can force buy the property back at 10% of the sale price.

Nothing to see here. Just more theft from us lowly commoners to the people at the top. Literally none of us will be in the running to purchase these large swathes of land.

"Nevada has 4 representatives and 2 senators. Both senators are Democrats, and 3 out of 4 representatives are Democrats.  The single Republican Congress member, Mark Amodei, representing Northern Nevada (Reno, Sparks, Carson City), amended Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" to sell off 10,000 acres of land in Clark County (represented by the 3 Democratic senators, not by Mark Amodei).  When questioned in committee, he lied that the other 3 representatives knew about this. Later, when asked if they supported it, he said no.  The worst part about this is that the funding bill *circumvents federal law* that requires the money to go to Nevada. Instead, the money from selling 10,000 acres of land goes to the United States Treasury, where it will pay for the billionaire tax cuts included in this bill.  The part of Nevada being completely fucked by this bill isn't even represented by Republicans, nor does it vote for Republicans.",TryNotToShootYoself,2025-05-07T17:38:01,20

"Yes, our money. They're going to sell that land, take that one time cash influx, and give it to themselves in tax breaks along with their wealthiest benefactors, all while they deprive the citizens of this country access to the nature above and the natural resources below, both of which would provide a far greater long term benefit for the country.",monkeywithgun,2025-05-07T17:57:23,30
