"According to Van Hollen, Abrego Garcia told him that “despite the better conditions, he still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world.”  Abrego Garcia was removed from the US with 260 other suspected gang members on March 15. He and his family have insisted that he is not a member of the notorious MS-13 gang, and have seized on an initial Justice Department statement that his deportation was due to an “administrative error.”  The Trump administration has since disavowed that statement, saying that Abrego Garcia had no right to be in the US and was confirmed to have been a member of MS-13 by rock-solid law enforcement sources.  Kilmar is not coming back to the USA! 🇺🇸",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T21:28:11,53
