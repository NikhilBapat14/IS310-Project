"1. As to ""Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows,"" they're definitely *not*. In fact, scores have stayed within a narrow range for the past half century, even when accounting for the COVID dip.   [Take a long look at these NAEP trends going back to 1971.](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/?age=9/)   It's important to understand that it is not weird or worrisome that mean test scores are mostly consistent. That's exactly what's *expected* to happen when everything is working right and the major risks are addressed (*e.g*., poverty is alleviated, students with disabilities receive support, and teachers are allowed to teach.)   2. As to ""The Federal education bureaucracy is not working,"" the federal government doesn't operate most schools. Instead, states and school districts run these schools. The federal government sends money to these states and school districts, oversees civil rights, guarantees student loans, recognizes accreditation agencies, and collects and analyzes data.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T00:14:21,422
"The department of education only collects the data on schools and provides funding, they don't set the curriculum or control any schools. The state's have always been in charge of the education portion.   When this admin says they want to give back decision making to states, this is reference to the how/where the federal money is spent. The ED requires a lot of reporting and accountability for the federal funds spent. The republicans want to use federal money for voucher programs that would allow tax payers money to subsidize private schools.   Its all about the money, nothing to do with education quality.   The pandemic did have a negative affect on kids scores, but the main factor for the decline –IMHO– would be a combination of underpaid and disrespected teachers, over paid administrators, and underfunding at the state level, often times republican controlled states.   Also too much emphasis on sports.",dIO__OIb,2025-03-21T06:22:28,42
"It starts and ends with parents. Some kids don’t have parents who are present—or any real parental support at all.  Others have parents who push them through the system, regardless of whether they’re learning. Take Tennessee, for example: after COVID, some districts offered summer school for students who failed proficiency tests, so they wouldn’t have to repeat a grade.  Parents lost it. “My little Timmy isn’t repeating fourth grade! And how are we supposed to do summer school when we’ve got travel baseball?”  Too many parents refuse to admit their child needs help—or worse, they don’t believe the material matters in the first place. “Who needs biology, anyway",BotElMago,2025-03-21T06:51:09,61
"In my opinion if we were to look at what is causing rising illiteracy in the us en masse. It’s the rise of technology. Kids have constant access to their phones and dopamine hits on a 24 hour basis. The only thing we have done in the past 15 years is breed a generation of addicts. Couple in the fact that the parents are no longer really being held accountable to make sure their kid is disconnected (probably because they are struggling to live and provide).   Not to sound like a “back in my day snob”. But truthfully when I was a kid I was held accountable by my parents to do well in school, if I didn’t I wouldn’t get to play video games see friends etc, that just isn’t happening anymore because unless you are taking away your kids access to the internet you can’t really do much to punish them. And with how many devices a kid has, plus the rage of a teenager/kid going through withdrawal after a long day of work I don’t necessarily blame the parents too much.  In my thirties I have problems with being plugged in too much and I see the effects on myself of poor concentration from time to time.

"I think so many schools having kids with massive discipline problems is to blame.   If the teacher is just hoping that only 1 fight breaks out that week (my neighbor is a teacher at such a school)  then quality education goes right out the window.      I don't know what the answer is,  but I know for sure it is not ""more of the same please""      I heard on the radio (could be totally wrong) that some how getting rid of the national DoE would make it easier to allow parents to take the money spent per student, and use that money to enroll their kids into a private school.     Which for a lot of kids would be vastly superior.      The real solution though is pulling the violent kids out of schools that are mostly good kids,  and putting them into something like a boarding school with teachers and drill sergeants .   The kids aren't getting discipline at home.   They need to be in an environment that's making up for a lack of consequences in their life.",discourse_friendly,2025-03-21T15:38:11,3

"It’s liberal education philosophy. The DOE is a contributing factor but not the only issue.  We spend **80 times as much on special education as gifted education**.  Let that sink in a moment.  All our energy is being put into raising the floor and dragging the worst students up to a barely passable level.   Back in the day they used to fail out / repeat grades or be expelled for behavior poor behavior.  Now we pass them from grade to grade with no accountability. Liberal education favors *immersion* and mixed ability classes, rather than separation into ability based classes.  The idea being that good students can pull up bad ones - but the opposite is also true, where bad students drag down good ones.  This basically leaves your best students bored, unchallenged, and unmotivated.  Parents with means see his, and they put their kids into private school - which means even less pull up effect in public school from good students.  Meanwhile, developing nations trying to build up their economies can’t afford to engage in this kind of feel good equity.   They put all their energy into their high performers, cause the low performers will work in the shops so whatever.  So they’re producing tons of high potential students, and they’re jumping into student visas / STEM in the west.  The DOE is a contributing factor here because basically all of their funding goes into title 1 and special Ed. The funding is based on pass rates and performance improvements, which creates this kind of perverse incentive to always pass kids and grade inflate.",Kman17,2025-03-21T10:10:21,13

"I am a relatively new parent, i have a 3 and 5 year old.  The 5 year can read and the 3 year old is well on her way.  We depend on libraries to keep them engaged.  We read to them frequently.  And my favorite response to them being too excited or crazy is to tell them to sit down with a book.  From my limited experience with children their age, barring a learning disability, reading ability is all about home life.  And too many kids go home, sit on a tablet or watch TV because it is easier on the parent(s).  I get it.  My kids watch TV too, and i even give them the tablets we rent from the library sometimes.  But if it is the norm for a child to checkout and get absorbed into Paw Patrol, or Super kitties or someother worthless program then lack of reading, writing and math is the result.  The Departmen of Education cannot solve that.  Schools cannot entirely solve that, but they can help, if they can get the child engaged with without behavioral issues which is another problem.  Parents are the ones we need to support.  Its when they fail that the children suffer.  Libraries, childrens museams and other functions that support parent/child developement have been clutch for us.

There is also a lack of societal respect for teachers, where in some other countries they are as respected as a doctor or engineer.

The problem is parents.   I'm friends with a couple who homeschool their children and their kids consistently score in the top few percent of standard tests for reading and math (and also other subjects).   Ironically the mother in that couple is a public school teacher. The father is a stay-at-home dad.     But basically it's very simple. They don't allow their kids on social media. They don't let them watch TV. They make sure that they do their lessons and because they're homeschooling them they're always checking their kids' progress and focusing on areas that need help.   The household is very disciplined in a variety of other ways.   The children are all happy normal children who laugh and joke around - they're not all neurotic control freaks or anything like that. But the parents are deeply involved in everything that the kids do and they do a lot of things together as a family.   ,Independent-Roof-774,2025-03-23T20:07:41,2
"In a word:  Republicans.  One of the biggest changes was the No Child Left Behind which set attendance and test scores as the priorities for public education.  This resulted in a noticeable shift away from critical thinking because it was more vital for schools and teachers to ""teach to the test"".  It also pushed schools to become more prison-like in their culture because attendance was so important.  Open campuses became closed campuses to cut down on skipping, and other strict rules were put in place to ensure kids ""stayed in school"".  The prison culture of modern schools is not conducive to learning, in my opinion.  So I believe that has also contributed to issues with our public school system.  The other big problem is school choice vouchers.  This takes taxpayer money out of the public school and gives it to private schools.  It's also touted as ""choice"" but generally only privileged kids tend private schools even with vouchers because they have parents who know about them and are willing to send their kids there for a better education, but also private schools still cost a lot of money even with vouchers, so it's something that poorer families still can't afford even if they wanted to (because of costs like travel to to the rich part of town where the private school is, textbooks, extracurriculars, uniforms, etc.)  So the outcome ends up being taxpayers subsidizing rich kids who were going to go to private school anyway, but now they get a voucher.  The other issue that isn't talked about enough is that it takes the parents out of the system, which might be even more important than the funds.  Not every kid is fortunate enough to have engaged parents with the means and desire to participate in their education, but in a school setting, these parents that are engaged end up benefiting more than just their own kids.  Their participation in school activities, such as volunteering to chaperone field trips, doing bake sales, booster clubs, etc. doesn't solely help their own child even if that might be their primary motivator in doing these things.  The other kids that go to the school benefit from that parental engagement.  What happens with private schools, vouchers or not, is that you're taking the most willingly engaged parents out of the system.  You're left with a public school that has very low parental engagement across the board, and all the kids left behind suffer as a result.  Republican policies also contribute to other relevant problems, such as school violence, religious indoctrination and anti-intellectualism.  Long story short, if we want better schools, we have to stop voting for Republicans.",-Clayburn,2025-03-24T20:45:45,2

Schools do need, and should continue to receive IDEA funds and Title I funds to serve eligible student populations, and I hope that happens.

We are so bogged down with absurd requirements and held to performance standards beyond our control.

"Complex topic here with some relation to other declines, such as the fall in the number of working age people  working.  Lots of evidence for that decline.  We  see less societal pressure on people who opt-out of having a job.    America has departed from the straight-laced country of the 1950s and before: Children were pressured in larger numbers to do good in school and adults, especially men, were expected to work.  There were more norms on civility and public responsibility, and respect for law enforcement was greater.    Today there is more tolerance for non-conformance, people ""doing their own thing,"" including being idle, sometimes with chronic drug use.  This laxity morphs over to the educational system.    One element of this: our attitudes towards adversity.  Norms pre 1960 accepted that life is often difficult and people, especially men, were pressured to accept adversity (in the factory, on the farm, in the military, in life) as a normal thing.

"I have met Peggy Carr and I admire her. It's a disgrace that she was forced to go on involuntary leave last month.  I agree with her. We have work to do. (I say ""we"" in the sense that I am a parent, I am a taxpayer, and I am an educator). The work before every teacher is to take the child or teen placed in front of us at whatever level of ability they have reached and raise it.   Educators *invented* testing. Originally the point of it was to check  our own teaching, and this is still by far its most important use. We teach a unit, then test the kids to see how well we taught it. If more kids didn't get it than did, then we usually go back and reteach it in a different way, then retest.  When large-scale accountability testing became a trend, testing was given a secondary and far less important role. In this view, accountability testing is used to see if schools are ""good enough"" or if ""we are keeping up"" or (in the parlance of corporate privatizers) if ""we are getting a return on our investment.""  The larger the sample, the lower the variance. A teacher testing their class has an extremely precise assessment of a extremely small group, and they can immediately respond to the results.  In contrast, NAEP results don't measure a single classroom or even a single school since they're never conducted universally. Instead NAEP results show us the farthest-away view of how most students are doing in most schools. Because the sample is so huge, the normal distribution inevitably shows up, and that's what we expect despite some politicians being worried that half the students are below average. (Grin.)  What we really care more about is underlying patterns such as whether non-English speaking students or poor students or minority students or students with disabilities are trending the same way as the general population students.   We do care about the mean, but we expect it to bobble up and down from year to year, from state to state, from subgroup to subgroup. We know that if we keep doing our best, then that mean will remain flat in the long run. That COVID dip means kids are in need, so it means we have to respond.   When Dr. Carr says ""We are not seeing the progress we need"" she is fulfilling her role as an advocate for public schools, reminding legislators that schools must be adequately funded, that provisions must be made for the contexts of schooling (such as COVID), and that we must keep supporting teachers and families. She is not saying ""this is proof that schools are trash and we should fire everyone.""",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T13:40:12,7
"I'm not sure why the south is singled out here specifically, because there are few school districts in any part of the the U.S. that don't have high school athletic programs. Those programs are heavily subsidized by local businesses and parent booster organizations in ways that arts education is usually not. It is almost always the case that varsity football (and in some areas varsity basketball) use their gate receipts to subsidize all other extracurricular programs at the school.  To account for the relative lack of community support and gate receipts, many school districts in all regions of the U.S. use magnet and attractor programs for arts. All schools in the U.S. have some basic arts program, but generally it is the specialized arts-forward schools that have better facilities (multiple dance studios, rehearsal halls, black box theaters, animation studios, *etc*.) and a more specialized faculty.   Should every school have all of these things? Yes, I think so, but it is commonplace for homeowners to think they pay enough in property taxes already. Even so, education programming is directly and solely the responsibility of state and local government. The federal government provides assistance (notably in providing magnet school grants to create these arts schools) but has no direct authority over local school board levies or budgets.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T08:25:42,17

"1. Schools are subject to the same financial effects as every other entity, including inflation. This is especially the case in terms of labor costs, financing costs, insurance, construction, transportation and fuel, energy costs, and food service.    There has been a centuries-long trend of relying on personal motivation and community prestige rather than salary to keep the supply of teachers adequate. In the old days, when the majority schoolteachers were women, it was seen as acceptable to underpay them.   During the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, the Cold War push for science superiority, and the societal changes which integrated schools and began serving students with disabilities, this required a much higher level of academic preparation and it became necessary for most teachers to have postgraduate degrees. In this era, the traditionally low teachers salaries became an even sharper problem with teacher recruitment and retention.    It is now a persistent and crushing problem of finding and keeping qualified teachers at any level, and acutely so in secondary STEM fields. Students are doing well enough on the tests in reading and mathematics, but the constant shortage of qualified career teachers means they are missing out on all the other kinds of skills and knowledge that make for a successful life.    Moreover, standardized test scores aren't a good measure of the societal and individual benefit they provide. Schools help students become thriving adults in many different ways with many different kinds of knowledge, skills, and experiences with only a tiny part of all of this ever getting measured on a standardized test. Parents might want, say, an AP Calculus teacher or a clinic nurse or more bus routes for their school. All of these things would immediately provide benefit to the child and subsequently to the community. They would increase costs but have no noticeable effect on statewide test scores.   We justify increased spending because we want the best life for our children and the most skilled workforce for our community, not because we want a score to go up.   2. The fraction of services paid for with federal funds is not duplicative of state and local efforts. In fact, it's a federal law that grants can only supplement the local effort rather than supplant it, and every proposal from a state and district must provide evidence that this is the case.    The federal role is typically one of filling in the gaps, as is the case when states and districts either can't afford adequate services for poor children or for children with disabilities.   The ""strings attached"" to federal education funding are complex, but they are entirely reasonable and worthwhile. Yes, there is a lot of recordkeeping and auditing needed any time that public funds are expended, but those grants covers these added costs.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-22T10:59:33,2
"We spend the money to educate children and youth. We're doing that quite well. We do not spend money to raise test scores, despite the giddy promises of every education vendor.   That's because the standardized test scores are always 100% arbitrary, and are typically designed so that the mean score is near the middle of the scale. This is the best practice to allow for a robust assessment that can move significantly up or down.  So when we say ""This book is at an eighth-grade reading level,"" we're saying that an experienced educator determined that a good chunk of kids in the eight grade seemed to be able to finish the book. They're *not* saying that there is anything inherent and scientifically-measurable about being in the eighth grade that means that your brain development should be able to parse out complex compound sentences and verbal irony — but just that a lot of kids that age seem to be able to do that. Standardized test are supposed to be in the middle, always, and are from time to time recalibrated to make sure that keeps happening.   Also: We don't test the same kids each time. Imagine we were teaching a kid the alphabet. So we run through it with them a few times, and them ask them to repeat it. This is a test which they will always fail. We then run through the alphabet again a few more times, and then we test them again, and they always fail. We repeat this a few hundred times, and eventually, the kid passes with 100% accuracy. That's an example of what it would mean to teach to perfection. This is what teachers do when they use regular unit tests in the classroom.   Schools can't do that with an entire grade level worth of content, nor can they do with with multiple years of grade levels which is what standardized tests actually measure. Instead we test each kid just once and then never test that kid on that test ever again. The next time we administer the third grade test, it's a whole new class of third-graders. There's no reason to expect that they should learn faster than their predecessors did, so there's no reason to expect that test scores will go up every year.   This was the famous failure of *No Child Left Behind*. In order to get a bipartisan deal, Congress decided to adopt something they knew for certain was not possible. It was, for a while there, actually a federal law that every single school child in America would achieve 100% proficiency in reading and mathematics by the year 2011. This was *fantastic* PR and both parties celebrated adopting such high standards.   However, no one in Congress ever believed that was possible because it's emphatically *not* possible. Unlike a unit test for a classroom, a standardized test that 100% of students pass is, by definition, not at all useful and a very bad test indeed.   This part of the law was just for pretend, and everyone knowingly went along with it for a while. This was quietly removed when the *No Child Left Behind* act was replaced by the *Every Student Succeeds* act.   When the NAGP established the NAEP scale way back when, they deliberately tilted the ""proficient"" levels higher than most statisticians would have done. In other words, the test is harder than it should be *on purpose*. That was not necessarily a bad thing, really, but it was kind of simplistic: The idea in those days of two-fisted management and tough love was to somehow encourage growth by stress. However, that little flourish turned out not to be something that is particularly effective on actual students, especially since students, parents, teachers, principals, or school boards never get to see their individual results.    So now we just see the NAEP scores as the NAEP scores. They're just as arbitrary as any other test score, and only useful to compare year to year, subgroup to subgroup. The actual number doesn't matter, just the differences and trends.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T17:05:06,3

I may be biased, I graduated and probably only had a handful of B grades from K-12, took AP/Honors Chem/Physics/Calc (I hated English class...so boring, I have yet to ever have to explain a past participle).  She described it as a sound wave, it's got peaks and valleys that change. But ""no child left behind"" has negated ""gifted"" kids as they called it back in the day. They can't give them special attention because it's discriminating against the lower succeeding kids so your knocked the top of the wave down. And pushing kids through that aren't prepared or meeting requirements just to pad graduation numbers and appease parents is raising the bottom of the wave, but it's just numbers, they aren't actually doing better. Neither are good. So now our best and brightest don't match up to the world, and the lower end are left poorly educated which will hold them back their whole life.  Sad part is a few years ago she literally was in tears at thanksgiving because she had recently had some students transferred into her class. Well she doesn't know a lick of spanish, and the school knew this. The students don't speak a lick of ENGLISH. She had to depend on other teachers helps or friggin Google Translate. No translator. I think she said they offered her one of those at home language course programs...but that was AFTER they got in her class and she knew nothing ahead of time. Knew of the students... but not of the language barrier. How is that fair to those students and her? But if they get pushed through to keep rates high and ""not leave anyone behind"" they are falling farther and farther behind.",JesusSquid,2025-03-21T09:55:20,5

"> *You're thinking of Common Core, and that is different than Core Curriculum. Common Core rightly was a set of common goals students should achieve at each grade level for each subject.* >  > *Common Curriculum on the other hand was a for profit set of learning materials that was sold to systems as ""meeting Common Core goals"". It was full of nonsense ""new math"" and ""whole language"" reading programs.*  I'm an expert in all of these things, so I sincerely apologize if I have not been clear. I do not believe I am confusing them.  Here's my view:  I followed closely the development of the Common Core Curriculum Standards (CCCS) throughout their history beginning with the policy context created by national education summit under President G.H. Bush in 1989, the National Education Goals Panel and the resulting *Goals 2000* legislation signed by President Clinton, the second national summit in 1996, and the *No Child Left Behind Act* signed by President G.W. Bush in 2002.  This last action drastically altered the federal role by requiring states to adopt elaborate plans including state curriculum standards, create an accountability testing regimen, and guarantee that teachers were certified in the subject areas they were assigned to teach. At about the same time, programs such as the American Diploma Project and Achieve,, Inc. along with notable individuals such as Bill Gates were urging states to adopt coordinated standards that would apply across all states.   This is about when the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers hired David Coleman and Student Achievement Partners to create the standards, but only in reading and mathematics. These subjects were judged to be the most critical and then seemed to be the easiest to assess using machine-graded methods.   The NGA and CCSSO members then returned to their states and used their leadership positions to encourage their legislatures to adopt the standards, and then incorporate them into their federal accountability plans required under NCLB.   This was the environment when all the for-profit education vendors went on a long bender, clamoring to create all the learning materials you mention.   The way I see it is that the CCSS were created and copyrighted by two quasi-private organizations made up entirely of public officials, subsequently adopted by state governments, and then more or less force-fed by an army of corporate education vendors eager to get the federal funding from NCLB.   I don't think much of most the curriculum products from that era either, but they were definitely the work of the private sector trying to meet a public sector demand. When you refer to ""new math"" (which is from the 1960s) and ""whole language"" (which is a model from the 1980s) it seems like you might be compressing different tried-and-discarded programs from different eras. However, I *totally* get you and I largely agree with you.   In recent years — long after *No Child Left Behind* was rescinded and replaced by the *Every Student Succeeds Act* — vendors have tried to align the products they create for states that adopted CCSS and those that didn't. In practice, there isn't all that much difference in their state-differentiated products, and there certainly isn't any *more* difference than is mandated by each state's legislation.   These products are...okay, I guess. They do have some truly innovative features and, when used well, can help teachers identify kids in trouble much quicker and much more precisely than in the old days. They are, unfortunately, hideously expensive and overloaded with all kinds of dull, repetitive teacher training that is an added cost and which of course uses up even more funding. Districts do what states command now, and most states make clear to districts which products are favored.   The net effect is that even in states which adopted then abandoned CCSS then re-adopted a quite similar set of standards (I'm thinking specifically of my own state of Florida), teachers are using methods and materials and students are sitting for assessments which have a lot of overlap.   Unfortunately, there's not nearly enough overlap to compare results, so we're left right back where all this started: The only measure the U.S. has of comparing state by state student achievement is the NAEP assessments, which are now undergoing destaffing.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T16:02:13,8
">The drop off in recent years? It was the reading wars and not teaching a generation of kids phonics.  Yes, the ""reading wars"" happened and they did become politicized at the end. After *No Child Left Behind* and *Reading First* in 2002, it was clear that phonics had won and whole language had lost.  The slight dip in reading scores for 13-year-olds seemed to begin in 2012 and then continue in 2020 and 2023. These students would have started school around 2006 or so, well after ""the reading wars"" had all but come to an end.   Therefore, one has to wonder how much effect the reading wars could realistically have contributed. These students weren't part of the whole language heyday of the 1980s and 1990s, a time when the NAEP scores were stable.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-22T01:06:11,2
"> *You do understand that's not a good thing right? Particularly when other countries are increasingly doing better than us.*  Well, point taken. What I meant was there when we consider the last fifty year or so, we see:  1. Huge changes in context (vastly more women in the workforce and in university, changes in household makeup, workforce demographics, immigration, language proficiency, social media and technology, homelessness, even marriage and employment) during the last fifty years, along with   2. An enormous amount of incessant policy and program changes (desegregation and resegreation, the rapid growth of charter and voucher schools, technologization of teaching, high stakes testing, *No Child Left Behind*, *etc*.) and   3. Dramatic changes in who goes to school (few students with disabilities attended U.S. school in ther 1970s, many poor kids dropped early, interstate migration, and so on).  Despite all of this astounding change during that time, schools are still doing what they do, still graduating class after class of citizens who grew up to create massive and sustained increases in GDP.   I look at the longterm NAEP assessments more than the short term ones, but I look at them both the same way. The deep-level trends are powerful indicators of where we need to focus attention next, while the top-level trends assure us that we're doing pretty well considering.  As to comparing us to other countries, yikes. That's even harder. The best thing we have is the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), an international testing program that began around the turn of the century.   PISA also shows we're competing well, as I will explain below. The problem is that some people (in the U.S. especially but not solely) sometimes try to communicate PISA results in rank order. Even though there are exceedingly small differences in the scores of developed countries, putting them in rank can make a casual reader think something has gone badly wrong. You may have heard people say, ""PISA shows the U.S. is ranked behind (insert some other country name)"" as if this means we are losing some kind of race, but what almost always is more accurate is that the actual scale score differences are not quite so dramatic.   Here's what I shared about PISA in another comment:   [Here's a top-level summary of results for 15-year olds from the 2022 report showing the performance of U.S. students as compared to the OECD mean.](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i-and-ii-country-notes_ed6fbcc5-en/united-states_a78ba65a-en.html)  Some takeaways are:  * Mean results are down for the other OECD countries including U.S. suggesting that whatever factors are contributing to this are affecting all or most of the 23 member countries. * U.S. students scored about the same as the OECD average in mathematics. * U.S. students scored higher than the OECD average in reading. * U.S. scored higher than the OECD average in science.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-21T16:32:39,5

"Sorry for the wall of text, too much caffeine and a slow day I think.  Part of me agrees and there is a part that wants to say to leave it up to the school but that inherently will cause problems like you said. Standardized testing needs to not be this 100lb weight every teacher carries around and in my opinion...and i never had an issue in school... if a kid isn't passing their regular classes they either need to be held back til they can/do, or need special education. Schools, including colleges, have got to stop pushing kids through grades just to keep their numbers looking artificially good. I saw it constantly in college (mostly revolving around sports though, including covering up criminal acts because the team was in the playoffs in one instance). Chasing metrics doesn't show anyone the truth, admin aren't removed or changed, policies aren't changed, funding goes to schools that are NOT serving the kids and teachers right.  And part of it is just being human, those people don't want to lose their jobs especially if their efforts haven't changed anything, but they are trying. Artificially keeping numbers up paints over actually identifying problems. Problem might not be the people, might be the school, books, whatever. But all of that is painted over by ""good"" results but it's all a fasade.  I work in statistics and you can manipulate numbers to fit any type of narrative. You have to disclose your methodology to explain how you got the numbers in my field. But the schools are just ""Hey our scores are getting better and our graduation rates are high"" but the kids don't know how to friggin read or write enough to hold a job.  I think ""more"" control needs to be at the local level but not getting rid of the DOE. Yeah ok maybe look into their spending but don't shut everything down then look at what stuff you want to bring back or keep. Cut off the branches of the bloat and other BS, don't cut down the tree and watch a new one hopefully regrow better. At the VERY least keep the DOE there to focus on school providing those services, ESL, disabilities, poverty. Stuff like that, again at the least the civil rights dept and stuff needs to make sure students are given an equal chance. But if a student doesn't do as well as another that is a fact of life.   Full disclosure, I'm taking the experiences of my family member on word alone. I don't know the nitty-gritty on it. But the spanish students that don't know english and her knowing zero spanish besides a dozen or so words (""at least I knew bathroom in spanish"" was their comment) with no translation support caught me off guard. I say that all because they complain....a lot...about everything. So...take that how you want.  I also think schools need to promote college, trade schools, and entrepreneurship (tough lift for a kid though) equally. I know so many people with absolutely worthless degrees, working in industries that have no correlation to their degree, saddled with debt. (Liberal arts bachelor with $250k in loans that is a receptionist at a doctors office making $40k maybe?) And I know people who went into trades and were a ton of money in a rural area, saved their cash, started out on their own and they are basically ""retired"" before they were 40. Now they run the business and work on sites when they need or want to. Helped tutor a friend in HS who was dumb as a box of rocks imo but he was a hard worker and knew enough to graduate on his own. Dude makes like 3x what I do running an underground robot for drilling or boring or something and married a doctor. Still a goofy ass but he had no interest in college, went for a bit, dropped out and joined a trade union.

"Oakland Public Schools stopped teaching phonics in 2015. A lot of schools stopped teaching phonics around that time. It was a weird thing that happened. I think it's probably a consequence of deeply ingrained ideas in the minds of the adult educators that they learned in college that phonics is actually bad - leftover reading wars propaganda being drudged up.  There's also the elephant that's always in the room.. parents, their phones, and the internet. Involved and engaged parents have always been essential to teaching kids to red.  Mass migration probably has an impact as well. Kids who speak English as a second language, who grew up in a house where English wasn't the primary language, and kids who don't speak English at all are going to most likely score less well on standardized tests in public schools where the instruction is primarily in english. There's been significant demographic changes in the past 20-24 years and it's especially present in terms of school age children. It's going to skew test scores.",OppositeChemistry205,2025-03-22T01:26:45,2

I'm sorry but we never covered Von Mises in my econ education. His only value is to moronic political cranks. Also pretending like Keynes is ignored in economic curriculums is crazy. He's one of the most important contributors to the modern field alongside Friedman. You can't talk about economics without him. Also Marx doesn't get talked about in econ classes because he didn't contribute very much to the field. His contributions are much more relevant to things like history and sociology than they are economics.,akelly96,2025-03-23T01:59:53,0

"> *“Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows.  This year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math.  The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.”*  Yes, that's what OP quoted from the [White House statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/). This statement is regrettable because it was written in a way that is misleading or inaccurate.   Remember that by design, the labels of ""below basic, ""basic,"" ""proficient,"" and ""below proficient"" on NAEP **[do not represent grade level proficiency](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/guides/scores_achv.aspx#achievement)**. Instead, these are arbitrary labels that are deliberately set too high and phrased in an effort to suggest urgency, and remain in trial status.   If we follow the lead of the statement quoted above and look at the proficiency levels instead of means and percentile means, we see that student performance is holding steady:  **NAEP MEAN PROFICIENCY LEVELS FOR 8TH GRADE**  | |[Mathematics](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8/national-trends/?grade=8)|[Reading](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/national-trends/?grade=8)| |:-|:-|:-| |2024|Basic|Basic| |2022|Basic|Basic| |2019|Basic|Basic| |2017|Basic|Basic| |2015|Basic|Basic| |2013|Basic|Basic| |2011|Basic|Basic| |2009|Basic|Basic| |2007|Basic|Basic| |2005|Basic|Basic| |2003|Basic|Basic| |2003| |Basic| |2002|Basic| | |2000| |Basic| |1998|Basic| | |1996| |Basic| |1994|Basic| | |1992|Basic|Basic| |1990| |Basic|  As you can see, these proficiency levels are not particularly revealing or important.  If instead we look at the more educationally important trends state by state and subgroup by subgroup, to wit:  * The [2024 8th grade mean for reading](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/?grade=8) was 258, which is ten points below the historic high in 2013 and 2 points below the historic low in 1990.   The 8th grade mean in reading *is* low, [a pattern that has been seen in numerous other countries](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i-and-ii-country-notes_ed6fbcc5-en/united-states_a78ba65a-en.html). The statement that ""Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows"" is therefore correct in regards to reading — but only for the 8th grade. The [4th grade mean scores for reading are actually near historical highs](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8/national-trends/?grade=4), but this was not revealed in the quoted statement.  * The [2024 8th grade mean for mathematics](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8/?grade=8) was 274, which is 8 points below the historic high in 2019 and 11 points above the historic low in 1990.   The 8th grade reading score is therefore closer to its historic high than its historic low. The statement that ""Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows"" is therefore incorrect in regards to reading.  Morover, these results are measures of state activity, not of of federal activity. The ""federal education bureaucracy"" is responsible for the NAEP testing program but does not govern nor is responsible for how each state runs its schools. If a state's NAEP scores deviate substantially up or down and persistently, then there is probably something going on in that state that is affecting students.",Glade_Runner,2025-03-24T11:08:37,2
