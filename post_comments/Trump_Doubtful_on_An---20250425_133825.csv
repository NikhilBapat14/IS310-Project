"From Bloomberg News reporters [Hadriana Lowenkron](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AVRjv0JLC2Q/hadriana-lowenkron) and [Skylar Woodhouse](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUy6Fmtwevw/skylar-woodhouse):  President Donald Trump suggested another delay to his higher so-called “reciprocal” tariffs was unlikely, raising pressure on nations to negotiate trade deals with his administration.  Asked about the possibility of granting another 90-day pause, Trump cast that scenario as “unlikely,” while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. Trump also said that he would not drop tariffs on China, the world’s second largest economy, unless Beijing offers “something substantial” in return.  Trump said he believed financial markets were adjusting to his tariff policy, downplaying the volatility that has hit equity and bond markets this month after he announced plans to hit about 60 US trading partners with higher duties.  “When you look at what’s happening, I think so, yeah. I said there’d be a transition,” Trump said about the market reaction. “People haven’t understood it, now they are starting to understand it.”",bloomberg,2025-04-25T13:38:50,3
