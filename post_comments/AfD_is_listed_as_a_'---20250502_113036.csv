Surely getting the AfD banned isn't going to spectacularly backfire.,MikoMiky,2025-05-02T13:48:03,106
"Keep in mind folks, there was once a fire-wall against the Swedish democrats....but it crumbled in the face of electoral success. Sooner or later, the German establishment will cave to the will of the German people. The AfD's time is coming.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-02T12:02:09,125
"Absolutely no one saw this coming. /s  Seriously though, this is what happens when freedom of speech and freedom of association are restricted in your constitution. Anybody who opposes the establishment is labeled an extremist and canceled.",Pugnatum_Forte,2025-05-02T14:50:11,42
So you’re telling me some Political parties deemed a rival political party extremist?   Totally sounds like a fair democracy,Sheriff_Hopper,2025-05-02T16:44:50,18
AfD polled as being the most popular party in Germany this month. What's coming is inevitable now that America has thrown off the shackles of communism and can serve as a world leader again.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-02T12:56:23,39

"A country's intelligence apparatus used to undermine domestic candidates and influence elections? Sounds like they've been taking lessons from the US. Didn't work here probably won't work there, but they'll try anyway.",ngoni,2025-05-02T15:43:24,8
"It's not far right nor extremist. Their ""extremism"" is wanting to deport illegal immigrants as well as leave the EU because of the centralization of power, control, censorship, warmongering, etc. Instead they want to establish a new purely economic union. Of course leaving the EU would fuck over the elites and that's why there's the massive propaganda campaign of branding it extremist.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-05-03T00:38:09,3

The extremists are clearly those who are weaponizing state intelligence agents to undermine democracy. The leftwing Democrats in the US did this in the US during the 2020 election and it appears the leftwing establishment in Germany is using the same playbook.,Redditmodslie,2025-05-02T12:44:55,5
"I freely admit to not knowing much about the AfD However, I do know that as European conservative that being called ""extremist"" is par for the course for any slightly right of centre party not kowtowing to the leftist discourse.",Manach_Irish,2025-05-02T17:51:21,7
Can we see the reasons?  > No.  Oh... okay.,Dionysus24779,2025-05-02T21:34:00,5
All the Western powers are circling the wagons. They absolutely will not let go of their global governance agenda.,sowellpatrol,2025-05-04T03:54:08,1
"""Why did we list them as 'right-wing extremists? Because we don't like what they have to say, it threatens our grip on power, and they're too popular for us to get away with calling 'nazis'.""",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-02T17:38:48,2
Labelled extremist for not being extremist like the left,newcolours,2025-05-02T18:21:48,1
"I hope it gets banned, because it would light a fire under the posterior of the legitimately aggrieved.  It would absolutely be the most hilarious misstep they could possibly make.",[deleted],2025-05-02T13:00:16,-5
Who's ready for the trilogy?,Daniel_Day_Hubris,2025-05-02T15:37:45,1
"There are vast swaths of Eastern Germany where literally half the population voted for the AfD. In practical rather than legal terms, the party has become so big that it will be nearly impossible to actually ban it.   Also, we've already seen that the AfD voters will just flock to the next best thing if the AfD is not available:  In 2023, there were state elections in the tiny German city-state of Bremen in which the incompetent AfD state party fucked up their registration and thus failed to make the ballot. So what happened? Well, a pre-existing right-wing populist minor party called ""Citizens in Rage"" tripled its previous record result and took pretty much exactly the vote share the AfD would have gotten.",Black_XistenZ,2025-05-03T06:05:49,21

"Most young men see the label of ""right-wing extremist"" as a badge of honor now. It's such a huge boon for the world that the Trump administration has persuaded our social media companies to move towards free speech. Even though Germany's media has tried to bury the truth, it can still be broadcast freely from here.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-02T13:00:27,33
"A couple of years ago, an MP from Merkel's CDU gave an impassioned speech defending her asylum policies in parliament one day, then was appointed to Germany's Supreme Court the next day and immediately got to preside over one of its two chambers. Two years later, he was appointed the Chief Justice.  At the same time, the German government kept lecturing Poland about their lack of an independent judiciary, lmao!",Black_XistenZ,2025-05-03T06:14:34,10

"It's their use of language. You will never see the term ""Far left"" thrown around as much as far right. Its very telling that everytime any party that is against massive immigration, they eventually are labeled far right. It doesn't matter how sensible it is to not inundate your country with people that have no intention of assimilating.",OliverMonster1,2025-05-02T21:34:19,10

"That's okay. Give it another 5 years of uncontrolled mass migration and globalism. They thought they voted against Trump, what they actually voted for is subservience to China.   Let's see how it works out for them.",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-02T20:03:47,15
