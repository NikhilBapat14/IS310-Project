"The grant description continues, ""By attaining a deeper understanding of PTOCS mathematics learning experiences, we advance racial equity by exposing racist teaching practices that disadvantage historically marginalized students and identifying changes in teacher education that will identify and address practices that obstruct racial equity in STEM.""

"I am a manager at a company involved in manufacturing. The HQ might as well be located in wokesville, USA. For decades we have administered a basic GD&T and math test. It‚Äôs not a pass/fail test, it just makes it easier to place applicants should they apply for a higher skill position but belong at entry-level. All of the questions are directly related to the field they are applying for so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre asking them about quantum physics so we can under pay.   Legal hit us with a memo this year that we aren‚Äôt to give the test out anymore because it is discriminatory against those with less access to learning materials.. whatever.   We get a memo last month, again from legal, that aren‚Äôt to ask any questions related to their prior work history and take them all as fact.   We aren‚Äôt allowed to interview candidates anymore, just walk them through and hire the ones recruiting sends us.   I turned my resignation in last week.",Sad-Amoeba3186,2025-04-28T09:56:51,15
"I‚Äôve now got two folks who have sent me DM‚Äôs trying to explain why math is racist at a systemic level. Although they have been polite, provided sources, and seem to want to have an intelligent conversation, it‚Äôs off putting that they don‚Äôt want to have it in the public forum. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened to me either. What is it about public discussion of topics like this that proponents of these beliefs have such an issue with?",VCoupe376ci,2025-04-28T11:17:39,14
"> struggling to find any connection at all between math and racism  There's difference in math scores between some demographic groups, in particular asians do a lot better on scores than other groups on average.  According to approaches popularized by those operating within the orbit of terms such as critical race theory, any time you find differences between some demographic groups it is not due to cultural issues (like valuing different things) but is either due to lower scorers being oppressed either by explicit overt racism or hidden systematic racism. When you look everywhere and find no evidence for racism then by default it is presumed to be systematic racism.  It doesn't matter if any of this is true or provable according to proponents of this thinking, so no amount of reason or facts will change their minds. The conclusion is the premise and to work and get published in these journals you have to accept the premise of the work.",mikemaca,2025-04-28T07:44:37,18
