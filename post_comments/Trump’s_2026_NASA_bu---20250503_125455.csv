Can anyone tell me one positive thing that Trump has done?  I can only think of Uniting Canada in their dislike of him.  I guess I brushed up on civics.  So a couple of positives.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-03T13:06:08,23

Of course Trump's 2026 NASA Budget will be slashed. Give it all to used car salesman Elon Musk. Is Trump giving all Communications Money to Elon as well? Pullung it from Verizon and others that deserve and have earned their rightful place as USA'S Communications Providers? ,Pixburghman,2025-05-03T13:12:12,1

"There are riches in space, if you care about that. There is great and strange beauty in space, if you care about that. There is knowledge in space, if you care about that. There is research to be done with earthbound applications, which I admit is an ass-backwards way of getting it done but at least it's fuckin' getting done in the middle of Trump's rampage.  But those are all trifles. The real reason I'm for space exploration is that, despite its infuriating start-stop-start crawl, it's the way to buy humanity more time to see beauty and do all that saccharine live laugh love crap. If we don't make it to space now, I'm not sure future civilizations will have a shot after this one collapses. We've worked our way through accessible metals, fossil fuels, etcetera. Moreover, in an even longer and more idealistic scale, it's the way to spread life from the one place it grows. Beyond our garden whose time, despite all its beauty and despite the unimaginable time scale, is limited.",Rellestys,2025-05-03T15:33:10,1

"But why the penny? Why not start with dimes and $10 bills? Ya know, they things that are literally redundant….  I know cost to produce and such, but doesn’t it cost to produce other currency?

"Your right, overall as a whole this doesnt look good on a world stage level in general. Hopefully voters and the people will notice how razor thin the US and China could  be regarding space exploration because of events like this.",xpertdeltalol,2025-05-03T13:27:25,1
"The dime is fine; it costs less to produce than it is worth.  Pennies and nickels are a problem though, because the cost to produce them is more than the coins are worth. The nickel is actually the most egregious here, with the US government losing 8.78 cents for every nickel produced. The penny also isn’t great, with the government losing 2.69 cents for every penny produced.  However, abolishing the nickel is problematic because it would make change very awkward given the popularity of quarters here. Essentially, we would need to overhaul US coins for this to work. Alternatively, and IMO this is the more likely eventual outcome, we could choose a cheaper blend of materials with which to produce nickels.  Pennies, however, could be abolished easily. Other countries have already done this without issue, and let’s face it, the only purpose pennies serve at all these days is making exact change. Rounding cash transactions to the nearest 5 cents makes them completely unnecessary.",someperson42,2025-05-03T23:39:11,1

"There’s a race to settle the moon. China and the USA are on pace to land people on the lunar surface by the early 2030s. Then build infrastructure that will aid in a human space flight to Mars. And eventually , people on the surface of the red planet.  We are definitely in a space race , just not the same type of race as the original moon missions.",trogdorsbeefyarm,2025-05-03T15:39:23,0

"I'm gonna hold your hand when I tell you this:   The US won the race to the moon on July 20, 1969.   There was this guy named Neil Armstrong who was the first to walk on in it. His crewmate, Buzz Aldrin joined him on the surface just 20 later. It's the first and only time that nearly the entire population of the world focused on one singular event at the exact same time. 5 missions followed over the next 3 years and an additional 10 humans walked on the moon.",Slide_It_Earl,2025-05-04T03:39:47,-1
