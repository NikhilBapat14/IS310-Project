Uhm how is that a thing?,Pat__8,2025-05-06T19:20:02,13
Have any New Yorkers ever liked this guy? We always hear the same shitty names recycled over and over again.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T19:23:56,7
"Ah yes, let's reelect Mr. I Let Old People Die During Covid because why not, right?",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T19:24:06,9
"oh right, the same andrew cuomo that sent covid patients to elderly care facilities and caused a bunch of deaths  and then lied about it  and then left office because he had a pattern of harassing women while in office  what a fucking ghoul",make_datbooty_flocc,2025-05-06T21:32:47,3
Where's the 'Rent-is-too-Damn-High' guy?,disasterbot,2025-05-06T19:59:55,2
now he just needs to be part republician too,saiyanscaris,2025-05-06T19:45:12,1
soo were basicly either gonna have andrew cuomo or eric adams,saiyanscaris,2025-05-06T19:52:55,1
He's also running as a sex criminal!,oofig,2025-05-06T23:24:37,1
"Democrats are trying to bring back child-sexter Anthony Wiener, too.",box-cable,2025-05-07T17:41:56,0
None of the allegations panned out. I'll take Cuomo over Adams any day.,minus2cats,2025-05-06T21:12:48,-1
"New York lets candidates be nominated by multiple parties.  It’s one of the only states that does.  In theory it’s supposed to let third parties get a foothold by nominating the same person as a major party, so that people can vote for the third party to show their support while still backing a candidate who has a chance to win.",AirJinx3,2025-05-06T19:24:44,13
Fusion voting. It's pretty cool - I always vote for the Democrat on the Working Families Party line.,gradientz,2025-05-06T19:26:07,8
Fingers and toes crossed that he gets buried.,Kevin-W,2025-05-06T20:31:51,3
"Independent party is also a scam. It basically it just people that think they are signing up as an Independent not realizing there is a Actually party in NY versus signing up as Uncommited. The actual officers of the ""Independent Party"" sell the nomination to whomever is willing to pay for it.",Talbaz,2025-05-06T19:35:46,0
No fuck Cuomo.,TacticalFailure1,2025-05-06T19:25:53,10
"He's way ahead in the Dem primary polls with 7 weeks to go, so sadly seems like it.",IvantheGreat66,2025-05-06T19:26:22,4
"They seem to. God knows why.  He's my only ever undervote.  I left the governor line blank in his second run, knowing he'd win regardless.  I guess he's better than Adams, but that's a really low bar.",BlueCyann,2025-05-07T00:18:20,1
apparently people want him according to the polls. if you didnt want an election then your stuck with eric adams,saiyanscaris,2025-05-06T19:52:33,1
I'm confused by this too. I can't think of anyone I know who actually likes the guy,RatsForNYMayor,2025-05-06T21:01:15,1
I hope he goes broke... but I know he'll probably end up with another book deal. That guy and his brother are sketchy af.,thisoneismineallmine,2025-05-06T19:27:33,6
Seriously. All Cuomo is riding on is name recognition.,jayfeather31,2025-05-06T19:31:34,3
apparently hes leading the polls so its basicly gonna be him vs adams,saiyanscaris,2025-05-06T19:53:34,1
"Not just sexually harassing them in the office, when they spoke out, he actively worked to RUIN their lives.  This man is beyond garbage.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T22:28:22,3
Jimmy McMillan is apparently retired after repeatedly running for different offices these last few years,RatsForNYMayor,2025-05-06T21:11:05,1
There are literally millions of people in the city. How can there not be a better choice?,pgm_01,2025-05-06T20:42:01,3
The shitty NY mayor tradition goes back way farther than Adams though.,PinchesTheCrab,2025-05-06T20:57:32,3
Those guys got banned. Cuomo is basically running on an actual independent line with a new name-while also contesting the Democratic nomination.,IvantheGreat66,2025-05-06T19:47:12,3
8.5 million people to choose from. Sorry you might be stuck with him.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T19:37:00,2
And his sister has been behind the “Women for Cuomo” that has been harassing and attempting to marginalise his victims ever since they came forward.,Kelor,2025-05-06T20:48:40,5
"Also, people say “well the cases got dismissed”  Its because of a lack of evidence. It doesn't mean he didn't do it.   Also the Cuomos are powerful and corrupt enough to sweep something like that under the rug.",AllDogsGoToDevin,2025-05-07T08:43:16,1
Yeah but you guys finally got rank choice a few years back and have been really not putting it to good use,RatsForNYMayor,2025-05-06T21:03:25,1
"awww this was in 2022, good",Talbaz,2025-05-06T20:37:33,2
"Oh, no, I don't live in NYC. Still sucks he'll likely be their mayor.",IvantheGreat66,2025-05-06T19:42:08,2
would you rather have adams,saiyanscaris,2025-05-06T19:52:06,1
Curtis Sliwa honestly seems better than both of those two scumbags. I hope New York does the right thing and elects Zohran Mamdani though.,palebluekot,2025-05-06T21:12:28,2
"Silwa is a fucking joke. Not only will he not get elected because he runs on the Republican ticket, he won’t get elected because he’s a stupid racist asshole and New York City doesn’t jive with that shit.",Exotic_Investment704,2025-05-07T10:27:16,1
> New York City doesn’t jive with that shit.  We'll see how true this is if they elect Adams or Cuomo...,palebluekot,2025-05-07T11:50:50,1
