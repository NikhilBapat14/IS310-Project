"I had a good boss tell me that sometimes the most important thing a leader can do is to just get out of the way and let people do their thing.     Thanks, Dick, for showing your party what real leadership looks like.   It's gonna be a great primary.",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-23T11:29:02,3

"From Tina Sfondeles and Dave McKinney:   The gloves are off in one of the most competitive Senate primary races Illinois has seen in decades.  Expect Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi and Rep. Lauren Underwood to launch bids within hours and days of Sen.

In an Illinois exclusive interview with WBEZ on Tuesday, Durbin said more than a dozen people have expressed interest in his seat.  “There are at least a dozen names that I think are serious,” Durbin said. “...There is a larger number that has approached me and said they might be interested in it so I don’t want to rule anyone in or out at this point.”  U.S. Rep.
