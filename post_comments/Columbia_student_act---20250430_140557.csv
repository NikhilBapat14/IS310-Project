There are ideals, and then there is action.  Student protesters are not Trump supporters, but they can have expectations from the people who claim to be good guys, and are not outright fascists.

"If you want to say one side’s violence is justified while the other side’s isn’t, cool.

It means not committing violence in the act of assembling and speaking. By the standard you’re setting, a different administration could just as easily say that protesters in support of Israel’s war effort are not being peaceful, and deporting people involved.

"In the same sense that the Kims are ""god"" in Korea, I'd say yeah. For many, TV is a conduit to the world. What is depicted there must reflect some truth about reality. Police, legal, and medical procedurals are glimpses into the actual lives of cops, lawyers, and doctors; those kids working on yachts in Below Decks are actual yachters; the outrage and fear coming from the anchor or pundit must be genuine and well-founded; even expectations set by sitcoms and fantasy dramas worm their way into people's conceptual frameworks.  Don't even get me started on social media. Same bullshit, different medium.  The only cure is to become an epistemic masochist. Just know, you're wrong. I'm wrong. They're wrong. Everyone is wrong to some degree or another. No one has all the answers, and people selling you something are mostly bullshitting you (and all TV is selling you shit).

It's sad that corporations like big pharma have been funneling funds to them but big pharma isn't locking people in ICE detention facilities. Big pharma ain't disregarding due process. Aipac is working with trump to jail democrats, so this big conspiracy you try to tie to the Democrats is actually being used by trump actively now.    I'll again bring up the countries around the globe, especially in Africa that are now subject to their own genocide because of USAID being cut out along with other international aid efforts.   https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/africa/sudan-usaid-famine.html  You keep trying to shift the goalposts of how bad Kamala is in regards to trump, but do you ever criticize what trump is doing as it's thousands of times worse than what Biden and Kamala ran on. The world is on fire and you still want to make purity arguments of Harris, a woman. Instead of understanding how bad trump is and move on to defeat him.   For some reason, your priority is to still criticize the campaign while trump has taken an axe to the world economy and has utterly destroyed relationships with Canada, the EU, and China.

Hey can you quote where I said Kamala is worse than Trump or compared her to Trump?   My point is that democrats did not inspire *their voter base*. Not enough people will go out and vote for the best possible option if the best is only better than the alternative, voters turn out is high when people have something to vote for, not just ""other guy bad"". You can write a book on how bad Trump is, but he is not gunning for the same voters. So Trump being worse than Kamala is not a good enough argument, just like Trump being worse than Hillary was not a good enough reason in 2016. You guys can keep climbing that tree and see if voters finally accept it in 2028 - that democrats offer incremental change, if any. Or you can accept that just being better than Trump doesn't work, and go for real left policies.
