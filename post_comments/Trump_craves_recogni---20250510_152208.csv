He isn't winning diplomatically at Ukraine.  He was simply begging without any bargaining power.,thieh,2025-05-10T15:24:44,1
Diplomatic win??? Pakistan just broke the cease fire again that trump took credit for 3 hours ago,messyJanitor,2025-05-10T15:26:37,1

He's the shitmaker.,Diligent-Wave-4150,2025-05-10T15:25:36,1
"He so badly wants a Nobel Peace Prize just like Obama. Unfortunately for Trump, they typically aren’t given to fascists.",Azmtbkr,2025-05-10T15:38:16,1
Dude alienated all of our allies then destroyed the economy. How much more mediocre does he have to be until yall see him for the garbage that he is.,JoeMorgan76,2025-05-10T15:39:20,1
"“That low IQ individual Obama got a Noble Pieces Prize AND I WANT ONE TOO!”   Donald Trump, probably.",OpusDeiPenguin,2025-05-10T15:40:14,1
He's at war with his own citizens and is threatening military action on at leat 6 or 7 fronts. How does that possibly make him a peacemaker president?,invalidpassword,2025-05-10T15:40:04,1
"The orange gasbag has clearly communicated to other countries that the US is now isolationist, refusing to use diplomatic soft power to resolve conflicts, and using Kegseth to muck up the hard power of the Pentagon and our armed services, rendering them inert. He's doing on outstanding job on those fronts.",FakeJakeFapper85,2025-05-10T15:41:09,1
Hard to call yourself a peacemaker when you consistently perceive a lot of people as “enemies”,VladtheInhaler999,2025-05-10T15:47:29,1
"Has 0 for 3 so far. No peace in Ukraine, Gaza or Kashmir.",VoteQuimby24,2025-05-10T15:51:33,1
"He wants to be the peacemaker while banging the drums of war against Canada, Mexico and Greenland? Or should we talk about mr peacemaker starting a global trade war because he lashed out at everyone besides a few dictatorships like north Korea and Russia?  Trump craves attention. He is probably starting to panic in his old age about what people will think of him when he is gone. Maybe his ego is becoming even more fragile as the dementia ramps up.   Doesn't really matter. He is a piece of shit and will be remembered as a piece of shit.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-10T16:36:39,1
"He's a man child craving attention from literally everyone.  Demented Don thinks he will go down in the history books as some golden god hero.  The reality is the only people that will remember him are not really significant.  So, he will just be remembered as an ugly stain on our nation that he is and should be remembered as.  ",arilupe,2025-05-10T15:41:17,1

Wins? What wins? I've seen no wins. And I read a whole mess of news.,HonoredPeople,2025-05-10T17:28:44,1
He gave Ukraine to Putin in return for nothing.   Where's the win? ,NickelBackwash,2025-05-10T15:41:27,1

"And Putin still wouldn’t stop. Israel hasn’t even stopped mowing down Gaza. The Houthis are confused because they want to keep shooting at ships, and India and Pakistan didn’t even last past a night before they started shooting each other again.",ithinkyouresus,2025-05-10T16:50:47,1
