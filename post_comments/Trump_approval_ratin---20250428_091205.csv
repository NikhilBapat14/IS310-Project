"Wow, that’s about 41% higher than it should be.",salteedog007,2025-04-28T09:18:08,157
And those 41% of people polled that still approve are a complete embarrassment and disgrace to the human race. Too bad it’s everyone else that’s embarrassed and they’re too dumb to realize they shit the bed. We need stronger words than “sad” and “pathetic” for these morons.,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-28T09:38:07,64

"That’s not good. It means 41% of people surveyed still think this is acceptable.  Stop with this angle. It’s not doing anything in shifting public opinion on policies and governance.   News outlet need to wise up that trump don’t need them. But news needs trump. Stop covering him this way.  Call out his lies. Don’t add opinions, don’t engage. Call out and forget.  That’s how you get people back into news and not their social media feeds",Bleakwind,2025-04-28T10:54:02,6

"Not defending them, but that 41% never receive unfiltered facts or any criticism of what is going on.  Most of them have Fox or OAN on the TV all morning and the right-wing newsources on their computer screens.  The entire MAGA newsworld reinterprets everything for them, so that they are made to believe everything is great no matter how stark the reality may be.  They literally see a different world than you do.",sane_sober61,2025-04-28T09:43:34,27
I really don’t understand how so many people can be this stupid and still function as human beings   This level of stupidity on such a mass scale is truly difficult to comprehend,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-28T13:48:56,7

Obama was at 41% at some points in 2014. His party got destroyed in the elections that year. Just like Republicans will next year.,N0S0UP_4U,2025-04-29T07:36:32,1
Conservatives own the entire information space. They own all legacy media. They own all social media. The global far right own all the bot farms  What do democrats do? They hold up signs.  Make some damn bot farms already,Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-28T18:32:52,5

Make some damn bot farms already   Edit: A republican will turn on cable news and see that pronouns are killing people. They'll check social media, and see ben shapiro telling everyone that pronouns hate america. Then their friends post rage bait about how pronouns are turning their kids gay. Then they go onto twitter and see musk rewtweeting some rage bait example of a time when a pronoun pedo'd some kid (but it turns out the person didn't exist)",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-28T18:37:54,2

"How does a party make a bot farm? I agree we need similar messaging systems (robust brainwashing, but in a good way; education-washing if you will… heck, maybe even “sane-washing”) that conservatives have.",Front-Lime4460,2025-04-29T08:18:55,1
Funny enough Obama was my first vote post college. My parents were like “what happened to you?” I was confused because I was literally just voting for the person who made the most sense. Fucking weirdos  PS. Glad you broke free!!!,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-28T10:54:32,5
