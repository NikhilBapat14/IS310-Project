Trump thinks what he's doing is driving a hard bargain.    He is trying to make China blink.  They won't.  But because he's a psychopath it doesn't concern him at all that he's costing other people money and jobs.    He's playing chicken with the economy.,Searchlights,2025-04-29T13:15:47,44

"Some Sun Tzu quotes that appear to apply aptly to Trump.:  *Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.*  *Convince Your Enemies that he will gain very little by attacking you; this will diminish his enthusiasm.*  *The Supreme Art of War is to subdue the enemy without fighting.*  *The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.*  *Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.*  *Disorder came from order, fear came from courage, weakness came from strength*  *Those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength.*  *Many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat.*  *There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:*   *Recklessness, which leads to destruction;*   *Cowardice, which leads to capture;*   *A hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;*   *A delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;*   *Over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.*  *The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.*  *The wise warrior avoids the battle.*  TL;DR: Use his weak will, lack of understanding, and fragile ego against him.",krozarEQ,2025-04-29T15:30:20,5
Maybe their shittier than shit tariff calculations assumed the flow of goods would remain constant? Loss of 39% with an increase over 100% puts you at a net zero to negative gain.,katiescasey,2025-04-29T15:23:03,2
