"no, it's illegal. Members of congress simply aren't investigated for it and can simply pay some fines. Under any actual investigation they would all be charged   The laws regarding profiteering from politics were made meaningless ages ago",shanatard,2025-05-05T15:34:35,1
"The STOCK Act is weaker than a lot of insider trading laws and provides fewer prosecutorial tools. Even when members of Congress are investigated under it there are not likely to be prosecutions (see: 2020).¬†   This is a legislative problem, which could be fixed by Congress.¬†   By contrast, the corruption of the Trump White House doesn't have a legislative fix because the DOJ won't enforce the law and SCOTUS has legalized bribery in all but the most extreme circumstances. Congress can't do much other than impeachment (which they won't do of course).¬†",spleeble,2025-05-05T15:44:51,1
"This isn't a legislative problem at all. unless there is a law explicitly stating congress can insider trade (there's not), the same laws that apply to regular citizens also applies to congress  the stock act was an attempt to highlight the problem that they were blatantly ignoring the regular citizen laws. you don't need the STOCK act to prosecute insider trading.  i am super jaded at all this wanking over profiteering in politics until its convenient. it's always been like this. part of me thinks the president doing it is a good thing, so we finally rip off the band aid. we can stop playing pretend so they feel pressure to actually enact strong laws",shanatard,2025-05-05T16:17:36,1
"It's a question of how the law defines material non public information and when someone acting on that information is considered an insider.¬†   The insider trading laws that apply to the officers of public companies don't apply to members of Congress any more that they apply to members of the public. Meaning members of Congress aren't considered ""insiders"" under the normal insider trading laws until they receive information from an insider.¬†   The STOCK Act was supposed to broaden these definitions to include information that members of Congress are privy to as legislators. The 2020 investigations related to congressional COVID briefings, for example.¬†   However these definitions did not go far enough, and members of Congress have too much latitude under existing law.   This means that even if DOJ did try to bring charges they would be unlikely to get a conviction. Whereas DOJ probably could get a conviction on a lot of the WH corruption if they were inclined to pursue it.¬†",spleeble,2025-05-05T18:48:55,1
