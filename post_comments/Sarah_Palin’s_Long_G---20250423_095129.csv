I hold her directly responsible for a lot of where we are today.  She normalized a lot of fringe element shit that never should have been normalized.,wasted-degrees,2025-04-23T10:03:42,46
"She stands out to me as the prototype for the modern Republican grifter. She won a single election and served a scandal-ridden half term, but managed to parlay that into a 20 year career of ghostwritten books, speaking tours, and failed attempts to reenter politics.  She proved you don't actually have to win elections or even work in politics at all to make money in the right wing griftosphere, just be willing to debase yourself and act trashy on television.",TurboSalsa,2025-04-23T10:31:07,12

"I wonder if she's bowing out due to Trump is beyond the McCain Palin levels of toughness.I didn't read much about McCain and Palin.Trump's revenge tour,I check and see how much damage they're doing to humanity's future.I don't think McCain and Palin could put humanity in this much danger if they tried.",LycheePrevious7777,2025-04-23T15:20:40,3

"She made a fool of herself when she was asked what magazines she read ... lol ... the national enquirer doesn't count ... and on Russia, well dang it all, she can see Russia from her house so all would be warned hahaha ... she was a train wreak from start to finish and proves ya can't put lipstick on a .....?",mizmaggie54,2025-04-23T12:06:43,1
Tikis would have never hit the streets if it weren’t for Sarah’s flame,johnnyrenoir,2025-04-23T13:01:11,1
"She is the role model for the RWNJ women like Mace, Bobert and Greene. They learned that if you stay in the media eye, you gain power. Her problem is that she became the punchline to a running joke, and so she hasn't been able to stay in the klieg lights.   The article describes her slow fall from THE Republican It Girl to irrelevance today. She has gone from being a paid contributor on Fox to an infrequent, unpaid guest. She had a PAC which she was part of, but that is gone now.  The author proposes that she is now trying to be an influencer, and that she said that she had offered her services to the Trump administration, but there have been no offers.",francois_du_nord,2025-04-23T16:33:06,1
"I’ve not been following this and the article fades behind a paywall before I can get too far …is this case about coverage of her from the 2008 general? Because, if so, god damn",stuck_in_the_desert,2025-04-23T17:14:55,1

"That would be John McCain's fault. He listened to the ""advisors"" who suggested he needed to pick a fringe conservative because he was too ""moderate.""",Bhockzer,2025-04-23T10:05:51,25
I believe she was one of the first to attack “mainstream media”. I was pretty on board with McCain until he got talked into making her his running mate.,TheVoiceofReason6,2025-04-23T10:22:10,6

they are getting easier to spot now because they all look like Howdy Doody.,JaVelin-X-,2025-04-23T10:04:45,6
Yeah the opportunity in that particular situation also made *her* into what she became. She was nowhere near the worst governor of Alaska - much better than both her successor and the current guy. Willing to be pragmatic. But once McCain lost she was done with reasonable politics and she went full onto an unhinged bender.,Mountain-Link-1296,2025-04-23T10:36:40,8
