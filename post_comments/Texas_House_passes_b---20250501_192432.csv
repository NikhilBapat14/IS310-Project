"As another poster said, this is lip service. It's unenforceable. Even a weak VPN or open proxy will get you around it in a heartbeat. Hell, you can get around it with TOR. It was the same thing with the porn ID laws. These fossils in the Texas government may not understand technology, but kids have grown up with it, from the millennials on up  Edit for flavor: Do you think Abbott or Paxton's head would explode if they found out that TOR's creation was funded and developed by none other than the US government? We're talking the NRL, ONR, and none other than DARPA. The Devil on my shoulder thinks someone should tell them and we should find out lmao  Edit #2: Hell, you could probably tweak your browser'a geo location and beat it. I'd have to test to be sure, but I used to do it to watch local TV stations in a place I used to live, so at one time it was effective",StormFireX001,2025-05-01T19:47:10,7

Blocking Facebook and Twitter in Texas doesn’t sound like the worst thing in the world,Sagemel,2025-05-01T19:54:59,26
The state didn't block pornhub. Pornhub blocked itself so they don't have to jump through the hoops. Many porn sites are still accessible in TX by either 1) complying with all age verification laws or 2) ignoring the law completely and somehow have not been procesecuted.,arequipapi,2025-05-01T20:04:34,5
"Pornhub blocked Texas, and now those same kids are just going to even shadier sites instead.  Same will happen here.  Instead of snap, all the kids will go to Signal where they’ll be constantly dodging random classified war information.",Drakkarim411,2025-05-01T23:30:01,3
"If I was one of the major platforms, I'd say let them do it and we'll just cut off service to Texas. The porn sites did, and somehow Pornhub hasn't gone out of business yet - and they cut off service to what, Texas, Florida, and Utah? If the Porn industry can take the hit and not blink than somehow I think the social media industry can with even less concern. At that point you don't even have to worry about enforcement  Edit for addition: I mean really, think about it. If you are on a YouTube video, which is definitely social media owned by Google, what ads do you see? If you're not like me where I have pretty much everything blocked, you're seeing local ads. So who is that going to hurt? Texas businesses. Texas is a large state, but think about Google and YouTube's overall reach. When you are considering it on that scope, 38 million people is pretty small potatoes. Yes there's some fairly well-known YouTubers down here. Nexpo, Oompaville, and Coffeezilla to name a few. You want to tell me that they won't still be able to upload content? Their business doesn't require it to be uploaded from Texas, even if it's created here. In the digital world those borders aren't exactly restrictive. In addition to that, as I originally mentioned, it isn't exactly difficult to skirt any block that YouTube, facebook, reddit, or any other service puts on access to their sites. After all it only has to be a cursory block, they don't have to put any real effort into it. Just block anything geolocated to Texas and call it a fucking day. Their users will find their way back to them by whatever method. Only Texas loses.",StormFireX001,2025-05-01T23:40:59,2
"I imagine sites pulling Texans’ access, like PronHub (intentionally misspelled), or maybe companies will figure access to the user base is worth the extra cost. Very scary stuff.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-01T20:02:17,2
Oh I’m curious how they plan to enforce it considering people can just use VPN’s as well.,Jamira360,2025-05-01T22:37:05,1

"Yes. The small sketchy sites aren’t well known enough to get sued by Texas. All the big sites had to choose between A: invest in a costly identity verification system that opens the company up to legal liability if and when someone underage sneaks through. Or B: say fuck Texas, and block the state.  Which do you think money-hungry corporations are going to choose? 🤔",FearlessSea4270,2025-05-01T20:06:38,4
No it’ll go just like the porn sites. They’ll block our entire state because it’s not financially viable to establish a costly new system that opens them up to legal liability when some youth inevitably sneaks through the system.,FearlessSea4270,2025-05-01T20:04:45,3

"I don't disagree with you. But your response to, ""how will they enforce it?"" was ""the same way they blocked pornhub.""   Again, the state of Texas is not responsible for of-age people being unable to access pornhub. Pornhub made a business decision to block every TX IP address.

"Dude, the statement was intentionally obtuse because it was in direct response to someone saying “but how will the state ever enforce this?”.
