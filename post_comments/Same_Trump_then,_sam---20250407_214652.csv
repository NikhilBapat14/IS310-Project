"He was always a racist piece of shit, but what I wouldn't give to go back to a time when he was just a racist piece of shit running running a tv show and failed businesses rather than a fucking fascist dictator.",Torracattos,2025-04-08T01:30:58,15

I am a 90s baby so I didn't know about this until his first run at presidency. I was appalled then and still can't believe he isn't in jail. I am disgusted that people voted for him and still support him.,1001labmutt02,2025-04-08T06:24:56,9

We need people turning on Trump.  I'm not about to give people shit when they do.  Only when they don't.,AddemF,2025-04-08T11:24:33,2
"How did we get Trump?   Military service draft dodging in Germany. Trump's grandfather left in search of gold and money. After making nearly 600k through gold, liquor and his brothels, he tried to return to Germany, but they said Nein. Lucky us, his grandfather came back to the US and started buying property.

"He thinks he is the most intelligent person on earth and everything he does is right. He will never admit fault or error. He would just be a gross, racist, misogynist, rapist, fraud, thing skinned, rambling, obese, smelly, dumb joke if he had not convinced his trait sharing cultists to elect him twice.",lemons714,2025-04-08T17:16:26,8
I’m also a 90s baby and I knew this guy was a clown by the time The Apprentice came around. My (now Trump supporting) dad considered Trump a complete loser back then.,DinkandDrunk,2025-04-08T07:21:08,13

Middle school me and adult me still have that same value.",1001labmutt02,2025-04-08T07:36:43,8
