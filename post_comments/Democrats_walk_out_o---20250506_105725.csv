"This is the story they should be telling, the walkout is not the meat of the matter.  >As the president and his family have increasingly expanded their crypto portfolio, Democratic lawmakers and outside observers have voiced concerns about potential conflicts of interest.    >Most recently, the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, announced that its new stablecoin would be used by Emirati firm MGX to conduct a $2 billion transaction with crypto exchange Binance.   >Lynch, who had an opportunity to finish his remarks once the roundtable began, highlighted concerns about the newly unveiled deal.   >“I understand crypto. I understand the other issues here,” he said. “But this is a mechanism by which other people outside, foreign interests can actually influence our president. Not just this one, but in the future as well.”   So the Republicans are assisting Trump in creating a mechanism for him to take BRIBES!

Crypto is just a scam for scammers to see who can scam each other first. There is no party they support other than the one that lets them operate with zero transparency and zero accountability,beadzy,2025-05-06T12:56:44,19

"It didn’t used to be. I used to work at a company producing blockchain software. Most people employed were software developers or similar roles and had degrees, were intelligent people.  They’re not scammers. It wasn’t a scam. Nobody was scammed.  However, being constantly called a scammer got tiring. And so across the whole industry almost anyone reasonable was chased out to save their reputation, and so a lot of it has been slowly taken over by more malevolent actors as a result.  In some cases I think it was even hostile takeover style tactics to force down prices by calling everything scam but then quietly but it, acquire, and then pump it later.  So in a way, the hysteria of calling everyone and everything a scam has lead to many things actually becoming worse.  There’s a whole category of scam, recovery scams, and I think this industry got carried away and started to just accuse everyone of being scammer, to the point where it actually then becomes a scam in an of itself.  If regulation was passed years ago none of this would even have been an issue, but people didn’t want to “normalise it” and so didn’t, and so now you have this.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-06T14:47:10,0
"So you don't care that the President can now take legal bribes from literally any crime syndicate in any country that he wants to. I mean, the guy was convicted and guilty of 34 felonies for falsified records related to hush money payments, and now he can just do that legally without consequence.   Not that being made president instead of going to prison with the rest of the grifters is really a consequence.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-06T11:30:18,20
"What a nice world it would be if social media isn't the brain cesspool it is. All should be encouraged to refrain from making non-value add main-character-syndrome style comments.  Wouldn't you agree that no one cares that you don't care what happened?   Rather than waste time and resources, contribute comments where constructive engagement can occur.  Why don't you care? Surely that is very interesting.   And it would be even more interesting and engaging if you were able to articulate your reasons with using a first person pronoun. What a place social media would be if only that would happen.",srandrews,2025-05-06T11:52:57,12

"People hate to take a nuanced and thoughtful reconsideration of their priors when it comes to crypto. It sucks. I get it, it’s because people got hella rich speculating on it and others are jealous they missed out.   I was that way with bitcoin. I definitely learned about it in 2008 on some music forums and dismissed it as silly. Then learned about mixers in 2015 and still figured it wasn’t worth getting into.   But anyway, we could have tried to work this out with crypto before and at least been ready for these regulatory capture scenarios. Now we’re going to be miss the opportunity to protect ourselves from the AI boom as well because good faith actors get chased out by reactionaries with good intentions (protecting the vulnerable) but poor execution.",CanWeTalkEth,2025-05-06T16:56:19,1
"I somewhat agree myself, I think some are fine but some are nonsense, and it’s not even an issue I cared to argue about.  For some people it is a triggering and ideological topic, and some people get viscerally angry about it.  So it’s like at both ends there are people that are dangerously insane, but what I can’t figure out is why the anti people were so motivated and getting the resources from, other than they were stealing and scamming people hence the desire to label everyone scammers even when it didn’t/doesn’t make any sense.  So like people taking their frustrations with capitalism out by attacking a random store or cafe or something.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-08T08:40:28,1
"Yeah this is it. People I knew that missed out initially became totally consumed with anger, and then became anti crypto as a personality type, and then some became basically scammers themselves.  I think some them then told themselves that “this is just how it all is and so if they can do it so can we, but we’ll only target and scan the bad guys!”  And so it was like watching people radicalise themselves against anyone even remotely connected to anything blockchain related, and convince themselves they’re evil to justify what they were going to do.  So I think a lot of anti-crypto groups started to organise into basically an organised scam themselves, and basically became the thing they claimed to hate and then just disappear.  I think some made so much they stoped really even pretending to care because it was always just about money anyway, and so many don’t care that they actually helped make the situation worse as long as they’re profiting, and they’ll tell themselves that it was all just criminals anyway and so they just “beat them at their own game”. When in reality, this isn’t true at all but they need it to be true.  A lot of these people targeted random software engineers etc, and framed them as “scammers” and then ruined their lives over lies. And so a lot of the people now are doing things that people before could have technically done, but didn’t because of ethics, but as the market caps went up more and more psychopathic personality types took over and they think they’re “more intelligent” because they’re willing to use more extreme methods of manipulation and lies, hacks and spyware and threats etc.  So before it was more genuine software engineers interested in ideas that also liked economics, and lots of them have been replaced with violent groups and hacker fronts etc, so it’s now a lot of genuinely dangerous people in positions of influence who will turn to extreme methods to secure their positions, because a lot of them know they’re frauds.  If the last admin passed a crypto bill I genuinely think history would play out differently because it had so many secondary consequences.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-08T09:07:17,1
