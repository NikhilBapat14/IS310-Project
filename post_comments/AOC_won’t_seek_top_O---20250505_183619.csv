I mean I get it - she's reading the tea leaves. It's highly unlikely the old guard would have supported her candidacy for the post.,walkallover1991,2025-05-05T18:42:30,11
Honestly one of the reasons for her to take the position was to get a bigger megaphone she does not really need it anymore. The fight the oligarchy tour is raising her national popularity and getting her in front of people. I think she is going to run for president and she has a very good chance of winning a primary in a fair primary.,sedatedlife,2025-05-05T19:50:21,9
