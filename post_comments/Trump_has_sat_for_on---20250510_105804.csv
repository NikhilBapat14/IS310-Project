Why would he bother? He’s already been told by Putin and the Heritage Foundation what to do. He doesn’t need any “information”.,MotherofHedgehogs,2025-05-10T11:15:49,21
I feel so much safer knowing that Trump isn’t paying attention to world affairs that don’t bring him attention. The less he knows the better.,Huckleberry199,2025-05-10T11:15:55,12
"I mean, the jokes about Trump and *intelligence* briefings write themselves, but obviously this is actually dangerous since he's making decisions without actually listening to the information from the experts.  > “It’s sadly clear that President Trump doesn’t value the expertise of and dangerous work performed by our intelligence professionals each and every day, and unfortunately, it leaves the American people increasingly vulnerable to threats we ought to see coming,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to POLITICO  >""The point of having an $80 billion intelligence service is to inform the president to avert a strategic surprise,” said a former CIA analyst who, like others in this story, was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters.",undercurrents,2025-05-10T10:59:59,7
If he doesn't hear it on Fox news then he's oblivious to whatever else is happening.,MLJ9999,2025-05-10T11:43:13,4
"I read, and I don't have anything to prove it, that during his first term the briefings had to be tailored to him.  He would zone out, start babbling about Hillary Clinton, talking about golf.  They were instructed to include as many pictures and as few words as possible in the  briefings as possible.",tinyE1138,2025-05-10T11:50:06,3
He truly has no idea what is going on. His appointees are running the show and just shoving EOs under his nose to sign while he poses for photo ops.,SucksYouSay,2025-05-10T12:36:17,3
Can someone put intelligence in quotes instead?,Ms74k_ten_c,2025-05-10T12:06:55,1
We’re better off if he’s out of the loop.,ArchieThomas72,2025-05-10T12:14:21,1
I am intelligent enough by myself. Trust me.I know more about intelligence than anyone else in the world,Past_Page_4281,2025-05-10T13:20:43,1
"So, let me see if I get this right: He never reads his briefings because he's too lazy and uninterested, instead relying on whatever his out-of-their-depths secretaries think to tell him when he deigns to be briefed. And I personally suspect they're too lazy or distracted to read those briefings too.  What could possibly go wrong?",CleverDad,2025-05-10T13:47:47,1

"Whatever, that's just for **your** definition of *daily*.",zero_dr00l,2025-05-10T14:42:59,1
When even “brief” is too long for your attention span.   Maybe they should rename it to “intelligence flash card.”,KingBooRadley,2025-05-10T15:44:03,1
They would have to rename the meeting if he were to attend.,Sp4rt4n423,2025-05-10T15:55:40,1
He could sit for every one of them & not gain any intelligence.,kevint1964,2025-05-10T16:06:43,1
"That and the only reason he ran at all, was to stay out of prison because he knew that's where he was likely headed had he not.  He also eyed a second tern as a chance to make some money off of the oval office. You can tell by his body language, speech and facial expressions that he'd much rather be retired to his golf course. I mean he has everyone else around him practically running everything while he just scrawls his signature on whatever is put in front of him without even reading or studying up on WTF he's signing. The ""first lady"" doesn't even want to be there, as she doesn't even live in the White House.",LivingIndependence,2025-05-10T13:47:33,7
Exactly how I feel!    If he doesn’t know about important intelligence decisions then we don’t have to worry about Trump alerting Putin & Musk!    Though I am sure there are others who are doing that for him!,SAGELADY65,2025-05-10T11:41:48,3
I thought he was still pissed at them for saying the election wasn't rigged and posting accurate poles.,tinyE1138,2025-05-10T11:52:43,2

"Its why they wanted him.  He's too stupid to know what they're doing, and will end up taking all the blame when it blows up...",AmSoDoneWithThisShit,2025-05-10T14:33:01,1
I would argue the reason he ran at all is the same as it has always been with him. Self promotion and ways to grift.   Sure prison is in there as well but the man has been running scams for decades. It's all he knows how to do.  He went from almost broke when he came down that elevator to an actual billionaire with his grift since that elevator.,Vanman04,2025-05-10T17:37:39,1
Musk and Putin are probably attending on his behalf.,bow2yrsensei,2025-05-10T14:28:45,3

"I forget that we are not in Real World any more.   You are probably correct they would have all their conversations on speakerphone so Putin, Musk, X and Mrs. Hegseth can listen in and add their comments!
