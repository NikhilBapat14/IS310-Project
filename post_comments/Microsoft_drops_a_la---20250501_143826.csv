"It's a much better look to be a law firm that fights, that's for sure.  What company would want counsel from spineless bootlickers?",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-01T14:46:43,1
Makes sense to me as a pure business decision.   Personally I'd want to hire lawyers that didn't back down from an upcoming legal battle.,thefinalhex,2025-05-01T14:52:27,1
This is the way.   Vote with your wallets.,StronglyHeldOpinions,2025-05-01T15:04:46,1
For real.. If you need outside council to litigate against the government....,MsWumpkins,2025-05-01T14:44:55,1

Trump is even making me a fan of Microsoft.  Holy shit this guy is evil.,swiftekho,2025-05-01T15:36:24,1
The real question is why any major organization would want a law firm that shows they will not fight the current administration. Guess who is often bringing these orgs to court got major violations? The fed.,mowotlarx,2025-05-01T15:38:51,1
"A very clear warning to both the public and politicians: industrialists will do whatever they think is best for them.    Act accordingly, vote accordingly, and buy accordingly.",happyfundtimes,2025-05-01T15:16:16,1
This just in! Trump is getting rid of Microsoft computers and installing Mac’s in the White House.,Broken_Timothy,2025-05-01T15:27:26,1
"Why the fuck would anyone hire a LAW FIRM that immediately caves to blatantly unconstitutional demands?  Like, even if you're a Trumper.  That's who you want representing you?  lol",obligatorythr0waway,2025-05-01T15:31:40,1
I wouldn't want counsel that is not willing to defend themselves.,jonistaken,2025-05-01T15:36:10,1
Why should anyone think a law firm would fight for their clients if they won't even fight for themselves?,VoijaRisa,2025-05-01T15:37:23,1
This is how you do it,thrillafrommanilla_1,2025-05-01T15:47:10,1
Unless the company was also a spineless bootlicker,nanobot001,2025-05-01T15:21:28,1
The law firms targeted by Trump do a lot of mergers and acquisitions. Companies don't want the government to block a deal because they are using a law firm that Trump doesn't like.,OddlyFactual1512,2025-05-01T15:44:59,1
Yeah  Best decision that would be so far,AvaLavina,2025-05-01T14:54:50,1
"Oh absolutely. They know exactly what they’re doing to. Amazon leaking that they’d show tariffs on the prices of goods on Amazon was them testing the waters. Jamie Dimon being interviewed and saying that he has been reading about WW2 and stressing the importance of transatlantic alliances. They’re not going to openly oppose until the rest of society has caught up, but they’re hedging their bets now.",Disgruntled-Cacti,2025-05-01T15:29:57,1
"And don't for a second confuse these corporations as being on your side just because they momentarily do something that looks to be against Trump's favor. They're still selling you out in other ways, and I don't even trust this to be a true sign they've turned on him.",KanyesLostSmile,2025-05-01T15:17:54,1
