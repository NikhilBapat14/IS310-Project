"This is partially a vanity thing of course, but Trump knows how to manipulate the public for his greater goals…  He already has his martial law-lite exec order that will result in the military “helping” with public order across the country, and now he is seeking to increase the jingoistic feelings in the country - support for the military. Those two things aren’t isolated, and neither is Trump’s plan to use the military to annex a country or two.

I can remember only two ceremonies or parade activities that improved my morale at all.  Most of them was ranged from annoyances (retirement ceremonies where we had to stand in formation and listen to people we'd never seen talk for fifteen minutes) to major pains in the ass (anything post-boot camp that involved drill) to can-we-just-get-to-the-drinking-already (Birthday Balls and mess nights).  The only two that did make me feel good were both in boot camp.

Might have been a lose-lose situation either way, but once again, leaving a fascist oligarch with a monopoly over U.S. space travel just feels so wrong.  And I personally don't think having a functioning moon rocket in any capacity is a bad deal, no matter how expensive, because few countries can say they have one. Saturn V was also expensive as fuck but it had clear trickle down effects in science and technology — and put American astronauts on the moon. The Trump administration is making it clear that we are surrendering our technological pursuits to other countries like China by scrapping decades' worth of public sector R&D, even if the results of that labor weren't efficient or optimal.  Commercial ""could do"" is all hypothetical and hasn't been proven yet. I believe we should stick with what we have until alternatives are present and functioning. Nobody knows what the eventual cost figures for a Starship launch and recovery would look like until they actually produce a complete mission. Hopefully, cheaper commercial alternatives will revolutionize trips into deep space, but we just don't have data on it because that technology doesn't currently exist.",More-Perspective-838,2025-05-04T20:54:27,5
