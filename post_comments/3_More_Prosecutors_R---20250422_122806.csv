I wonder how quickly that place will run out of prosecutors.  Maybe that's the whole point.,thieh,2025-04-22T12:33:02,18
Nice to see some backbone. That dismissal was naked corruption. The case was solid and Adams should have been prosecuted. The directive to seek the dismissal was based on strong arming Adams to help Trump's migrant hunting goals and they wanted to continue strong arming him with a dismissal without prejudice so they could refile the charges any time Adams stepped out of line.  Good on the judge for dismissing it with prejudice so the feds couldn't continue to extort Adams. Letting him off was the lesser of two evils there.,travio,2025-04-22T12:38:18,18
"Let me get this right: Adams did crimes “allegedly”, Trump said don’t prosecute, these lawyers are quitting now?",RushPrimary2112,2025-04-22T19:45:29,3
"I don't expect so dim a bulb as Adams to understand that a pardon doesn't alter reality. He committed a crime; the president signed a legally binding piece of paper forbidding anybody from holding Adams responsible for that crime.  You still did the bad thing that everybody knows you did, dude. Nobody's incorrect for pointing that out.",ANOKNUSA,2025-04-22T12:36:28,6

Adam’s wasn’t pardoned. The DOJ dropped the charges without prejudice and a judge ruled they couldn’t have it both ways and dismissed the case,Equivalent-Excuse-80,2025-04-22T13:20:31,11
