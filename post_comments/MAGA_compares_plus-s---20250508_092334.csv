"By James Bickerton - US News Reporter:   Supporters of President Donald Trump have mocked a new 12-foot-tall bronze statue of a Black woman that is being displayed in Times Square, comparing it unfavorably to New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has launched a number of legal challenges against the president.  Newsweek reached out to Thomas J. Price, the British artist behind the statue, and James's office via online inquiry forms for comment.

"And liberals are full of hypocrites  like letita james, the same woman who committed real estate fraud but ðŸ‘‰ fingers at donald trump.

"In a very vague sense.   However, the way the comparisons are being made are not ""huh, I wonder if she inspired it"" but rather shit like photoshopping her head on the statue with comments like ""my favorite thing is that she actually says statue of limitations instead of statute"". So...pure, unadulterated racism.",Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-05-08T09:33:21,3
