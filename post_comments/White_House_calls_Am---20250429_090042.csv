"I love this for them.   Every company should put the tarrif price hike on consumer receipts so they can see how much extra they're paying, and no, it's still not a tax cut for the average American.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T09:06:19,37
"Displaying the tariff cost is probably a necessity for many products, depending on who exactly is doing the importing and fulfillment. Trump is just sore that people will see his big tax hike.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T09:04:15,22
"How dare you show people why the price of items are suddenly a lot more expensive!

"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Amazon ‚Äúhostile‚Äù based on a rumor that its site will adjust to show how tariffs affect the total cost of a product The statement comes just hours after a report from Punchbowl News suggested that the ecommerce giant will display the added fees right next to a product‚Äôs price.  ‚ÄúThis is a hostile and political act by Amazon,‚Äù Leavitt said during a press conference on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a surprise, because as Reuters recently wrote, Amazon is partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.‚Äù  Read more: [https://www.theverge.com/news/657807/trump-amazon-tariff-hostile-pricing](https://www.theverge.com/news/657807/trump-amazon-tariff-hostile-pricing)",theverge,2025-04-29T09:01:19,9

"Shouldn't they like this?  They have lied and claimed the tariffs are intended to make people buy American, to help American companies be more competitive and to bring back American manufacturing.  That collective is one of their many stated purposes that they move the goalposts on to defend the tariffs.   So, if people see that a product they are going to buy has a tariff charge isn't that a way for a person to then more easily understand that their product is produced overseas rather than domestically, and then that person can seek out an item that does not have a tariff charge which would then be an American product?  So, that would help further their alleged goal.  Yet, once again, they're too dumb to understand their own grift.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-29T09:19:00,3
Trump government hate to see that their tariff is backfiring!  I expect Trump to bully and sue all retailers showing the cost of Trump's tariffs.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-29T09:10:54,2

What‚Äôs hostile about being transparent about pricing breakdowns? They‚Äôre just pissed it‚Äôll be harder to steer the narrative when their base actually sees the consequences of their vote. Scam administration mad their scam will be visualized I guess,CJDistasio,2025-04-29T09:43:58,2
Am I missing something here?   Do the magards expect amazon to hide the tariff cost even after an item  is placed in cart and payment confirmation is prompt? Are the retailers not suppose to look at the total and not see a whopping 50% extra cost added on and are suppose to  think that's totally normal?,redditdubbin,2025-04-29T09:44:40,2

Amazon knows tariffs are terrible... They like any other business will pass that cost on to consumers. Tariffs are not a long term solution to replace taxes.¬† The wealthy won't care if they don't pay income taxes etc.¬† the middle class unfortunately shares the largest burden to make up the shortfall if incomes taxes are replaced with tariffs entirely.¬† Stupid is as stupid does.¬†¬†,Basic_Ask8109,2025-04-29T10:00:20,2

The issue is the majority of items we buy will not be from the importer but from a reseller and thus it will be very hard to indicate what that portion is as they may not know exactly. Very easy for Amazon to do this and good for them.,pzerr,2025-04-29T09:34:41,4
