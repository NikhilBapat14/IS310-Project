I know Republican voters will vote for whoever that R next to their name, regardless of platform. Many Dems do the same, but there’s also a large number who will simply abstain or vote third party.   Dems have the broadest outreach but competing ideologies that get in the way of actually doing good work. We have a moral obligation to be *effective* first and foremost.

"""Resist Trump"", like outraged criticism of Trump, is a logical and tactical error.  It continues to frame US politics as ""Trump vs. Not Trump"".  But ""Not Trump"" is everything and nothing.  It implies that all we need is a return to business as usual, the status quo ante. But business as usual and the status quo ante is what got us into this situation in the first place. Business as usual is lobbyists and favoritism and indifference to the expressed wishes of the majority of Americans. ""Resist Trump"" is like trying to cure a disease by treating outward symptoms, like putting bandaids on smallpox sores. As long as Democrats ignore the root causes (no, not things like racism or misogyny or homophobia or ""Christian"" fundamentalism; we've had all those for 250 years and it never led to Trump) they are merely engaging in performative and useless posturing.  There's an old saying that just because you're paranoid, it does not mean that no one is following you.  Just because someone is a racist or misogynist or homophobe or ""Christian"" fundamentalist does not mean that they had no legitimate major issues that drove them toward a charlatan like Trump.  Unless the Democrats commit to the things that most Americans say they really want – not things like unisex bathrooms and custom-tailored pronouns – they will dig themselves deeper into the hole they have created. Either commit to fair tax structure, sensible gun control, universal health care, good public education, living minimum wage, support for unions, and other basic programs that most voters say they want, or continue the long, painful slide into total irrelevance.  It's that simple.",nogooduse,2025-05-02T13:27:03,1

As long as the Dems persist in tinkering with image and 'messaging' and the like, they'll never win. They offer nothing more than GOP Lite. The DNC loathes anything progressive. Progressive includes decent wages, hours and working conditions, accessible and affordable medical care, meaningful police reform, meaningful gun control, good public education, fair tax structure, the right to unionize and a host of other issues, each of which affects huge segments of the population. As long as this basic fact is ignored in discussions and political calculations, the Dem party will continue to lose. So who are people supposed to vote for? Continue to support the Dems, who do nothing to help the mass of people? The federal minimum wage is still an absurd $7.50/hr. - the poverty line for a single person. The tax structure is still grossly unfair (that's how Musk got so rich). there's still no decent, affordable medical care. (Medical bills are still the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy in the US.) There's still no sensible gun control. And so on. Every so often the Dems beg for our votes because they're not MAGA. That's not enough.  Maybe the US needs this sort of disaster to force a true opposition party to emerge. The Uniparty is a very real phenomenon, and it doesn't care about the vast majority of Americans.

And the “People” did not give the Democrats enough of a majority to take proper action against a would be tyrant. In fact the opposite occurred, the People decided to kneecap them in 2022, and then in 2024 take them out of the equation completely.  Now we can talk about election interference, big money influence, and foreign propaganda seeping into our day to day media which swayed votes…all things that could have been rectified had the People given the Democrats the right amount of power to do so.

I’m sorry brother but you are just wrong. Ask a normie voter what was Kamala’s primary campaign promises and you won’t find a common theme. That’s a major problem.   You are just flat out wrong when it comes to healthcare. Also find it interesting you left out the whole forgiving student and medical debt thing but okay. Bernie has talked about universal healthcare for decades. Kamala has not been consistent about what she believes in. She was Medicare for all when it was popular but shied away when it was time to stand on her own.    She condemned corruption but had her brother in law who is in the executive branch at Uber.   Condemning Biden for sending genocidal weapons of war to Israel to carpet bomb Gaza isn’t a fucking purity test. That’s a big reason she lost Michigan. She was asked the softest of softball questions when she was asked what would she do different than Biden. The only thing she could think of was putting a Republican in her cabinet. WTF is that. Stupid political instincts. She also could have let that Palestinian lawmaker speak at the DNC. The speech was submitted for review and there wasn’t anything critical of Kamala in it but she still blocked it. That’s bad political instincts.   You say she called it a genocide… what administration sent Israel the weapons to carry out that genocide? Kamala lied and said they were working on a ceasefire but recent reporting has said that was completely false. The Biden admin didn’t reach out to Israel about a ceasefire. And Kamala refused to distance herself from Biden’s policy on that. Again TERRIBLE political instincts. It’s absolutely crazy that you can hand wave that away as a purity test. No. Her lack of standing up for what’s right played a role in letting the Biden admin continue to support a country that was slaughtering children. Images seen by gen z on TikTok and other social media. They saw how cowardly Kamala was being not separating herself from that disastrous foreign policy. Shame on her.
