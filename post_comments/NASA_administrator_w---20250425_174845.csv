The damage this administration will do to *every* area of US society will take *decades* to repair and much of it is unrecoverable as other countries/companies take our place or achieve results before us due to the GOP.,atreeismissing,2025-04-25T21:33:06,9

"Isaacman is literally the first (and to my knowledge only) person to place a Las Vegas sports book wager from orbit.   While commanding a private SpaceX orbital tourism mission.  While ""it's OK, I was young"" and ""what's a couple million in bad checks when you're a billionaire"" are considerations, gambling is always a red flag for any public official.  This Administration is like every insider threat lecture we ever got, come to life and wearing a red tie.",Aghast_Cornichon,2025-04-25T18:34:25,7
