As shitty as it looks who here who was investing prior to this circus didn’t own Apple and Tesla. Those are the two stocks on the naughty list being called out. As well as two crypto coins one being Bitcoin. If you were any thing interested in tech you owned all three of these in your portfolio somewhere.,nawtydoctor,2025-04-29T22:15:07,1
