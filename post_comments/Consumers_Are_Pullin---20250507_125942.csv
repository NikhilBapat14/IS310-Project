"This is how you end up in a recession. The logic isn’t difficult and you don’t need an MBA to understand:  - You go to spend your expendable income on a pair of headphones that were $150 last week. The price is now $300.  - You decide not to buy them because surely these tariffs are temporary and you didn’t really need them. All expendable spending ends for most households at this point.  - Prices on everything go up, on all necessities. People change their habits to buy less and spend less on all fronts to save money.  - Due to less spending, companies start massive layoffs. Expendable/luxury items go first but nearly all businesses will be impacted.  - Higher unemployment, higher prices, less money circulating. People start missing payments. Loans go into default. People lose their things.     This is literally an economic recession/depression. The volatility of a President doing this is unprecedented and it’s unknown how long the impacts will last. Even if tariffs disappear, companies aren’t going to have incentive to lower prices. I mean, you all got used to paying those “COVID-19 supply chain issue” prices that never went back down when there were no longer any supply issues. It’s just a question of how quickly jobs will come back, but prices will not be coming down after this.",brakeled,2025-05-07T21:35:37,3

"Weirdly, I started stockpiling on non-essentials last November because I had plans to quit my job and study full time for my certifications since I was done with the schooling part. I was set to do that January. Then Trump happened and I decided to stay in my job and do the best I could to get my certifications done. Sadly, I still haven't scheduled the tests because I can't get time off work. :( But hey! I've been stockpiling and my poor apartment is filled. Now I'm just focused on staying 'topped up', but I'll be backing down on that soon, more than likely.",Luzion,2025-05-07T13:19:29,3

I am guessing the 2nd week of August is when things get real. 4 months from when the 145% Chinese tariffs kicked in.  Most items in stores will have the new trump tariffs priced in.

"Hi. Be me. A toy store owner. This is EXACTLY how I feel right now. EXACTLY.  The other, other, other dumb thing about all this , on top of what you mentioned is that there are people in the rest of the world who can buy dolls made in the factories in China right now. We are NOT the entire world's consumption of dolls. Also those factories could retool to adjust dolls for various markets. There is NO scenario where these toys are going to be made in America. ESPECIALLY in a situation where now we are all supposed to have less of them!  In this whole thing, Trump forgot the rest of the world exists (like a classic narcissist) and it's not just us and China.   Many of the companies producing in China have sales reps and offices and HQ's here in the US that are good paying jobs. They are making perfectly good toys. I don't know when MAGA got so bent out of shape about ""Chinese junk"" but this isn't it.  Plus, the way things are going, people aren't gooing to be able to afford 2 dolls or 30 dolls. Shipping, trucking, warehousing, retail are all about to be on the struggle bus and the rest of the economy/jobs aren't looking so great either. Who would even buy these toys? Should I have stocked up more before tariffs hit? My sales are telling me nope.  It boggles the mind and I am so stuck and angry about it.",ToysForJoy,2025-05-07T16:03:25,35

The courier has already paid the customs charge (and added its own brokerage fees). They will insist on being paid or it will be sent to a collection agency.
