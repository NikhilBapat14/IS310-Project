"I think the relevant phrase here is ""slippery slope"". Building databases if this kind (as opposed to properly structured medical research databases) is generally problematic, as they assemble unstructured data from both medical and commercial sources into large, sparse, multidimensional structures which are not readily susceptible to robust medical or epidemiological analysis. What such data structures are excellent for, though, is providing supporting data for pre-created hypotheses: that is, they're great for ""cherry-picking"". With very little effort, it's possible to perform factor analysis (a statistical technique) that provides ""evidence"" of any particular claim that a biased analysis might require. That is, databases of this kind can be used (and have been used in the past) to derive incorrect conclusions advocated by eugenicists. To understand the statistical problem, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis#Disadvantages) for preliminary comments and discussion.  No-one is saying that the database being proposed is directly eugenic; rather, it's laying the foundation for a lot of bad research that can be used to support (unjustified) eugenic conclusions. It's part of a slippery slope. It should be resisted because it's bad science.",TelescopiumHerscheli,2025-05-05T05:54:16,52

"I firmly believe the autism rates going from 1 in 10,000 in the 1970s to what is now, 1 in 31, is largely due to increased testing and screening.   However in California about 1 in 19 boys are diagnosed with autism which I think should be a concern of ours.  Why is that particular subset is so much higher than anywhere else in the world?  And moreso, the rate of autistic people who are diagnosed with ""full-blown"" autism (meaning non-verbal, aggressive behavior, and require a lifetime of constant care) has risen sharply in the past decade.    I know I'll get downvoted, but is it wrong to see this data and wonder if there are other reasons outside of increased testing that may be causing a sharp rise in autism rates?  What if in 10 years from now 1 in 6 children have autism, would you still feel it's disgusting to look into what's causing this rise and try to implement ways to reduce the number?",ron_marinara,2025-05-06T14:33:54,1

"Yeah, the problem with that is that hunger, neglect, and poverty, especially generational poverty, can lead to lower IQ test scores, as can a lack of the cultural knowledge being referenced in the IQ tests.

When it comes to genetic diseases as well ‚Äî who gets to decide which lives are worth living? Would we all be better off if Stephen Hawking hadn‚Äôt been born? Basically, eugenics is based off of the idea that we can breed better humans, like livestock and dogs. As a theory and practice it only benefits the people who see other human beings as livestock.       Edited to add: the USA used to be all-in on eugenics. Not only did it lead to human rights abuses, including forced sterilization, it also inspired a certain European nation in the 1930s to start thinking about their own population, and how they could ‚Äúperfect‚Äù it by removing unwanted elements.

"‚ÄúEarly twin studies of adult individuals have found a heritability of IQ between 57% and 73%,[7] with some recent studies showing heritability for IQ as high as 80%.[8] IQ goes from being weakly correlated with genetics for children, to being strongly correlated with genetics for late teens and adults. The heritability of IQ increases with the child's age and reaches a plateau at 14‚Äì16[9] years old, continuing at that level well into adulthood. However, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease are known to have lifelong deleterious effects.[10][11] Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5[1] to a high of 0.8 (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated).[12] Eric Turkheimer and colleagues (2003) found that for children of low socioeconomic status heritability of IQ falls almost to zero.[13] These results have been challenged by other researchers. IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but it is unclear whether it stabilizes thereafter.[14] A 1996 statement by the American Psychological Association gave about 0.45 for children and about .75 during and after adolescence.[15] A 2004 meta-analysis of reports in Current Directions in Psychological Science gave an overall estimate of around 0.85 for 18-year-olds and older.[16] The general figure for heritability of IQ is about 0.5 across multiple studies in varying populations.[17]‚Äù",More-Dot346,2025-05-05T15:14:07,1

"‚ÄúThe predictive validity of g is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because g is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.[64] In elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50‚Äì.60, .40‚Äì.50, and .30‚Äì.40, respectively. The g loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of g. According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g, with the rest attributed to non-g factors measured by IQ and other tests.[71]‚Äù",More-Dot346,2025-05-05T10:00:31,1
"‚ÄúCritics have contended that an emphasis on g is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities. Some scientists, including Stephen J.
