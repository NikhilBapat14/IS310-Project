"A sociopath grifter asked his sociopath conman son-in-law to find him an economist that agreed with the sociopath grifter‚Äôs unfounded beliefs that bankrupted six businesses.

"They‚Äôre very ancient. Tariffs are old fashioned word, like ‚Äúgroceries.‚Äù Tariffs are many different things that come in a bag.

This meant he was buying groceries and when he bought those groceries he paid a tariff.  The word Tariff is a Middle Eastern word. It‚Äôs from ancient Mesopotamia, which was also called Egypt.  There once was a very famous actor - Omar Tariff. He starred in a movie about Russia with Barbra Streisand. She was awful. An ugly, big nosed woman - did you see her nose? Very big. Not attractive at all. Not a 10. She‚Äôs a number 2, I believe. A real dog. She clones dogs, in fact. A dog who‚Äôs a mother of dogs.  There‚Äôs a photo of her house on the internet. It‚Äôs nothing.
