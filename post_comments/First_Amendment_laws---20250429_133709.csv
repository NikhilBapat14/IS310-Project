Sounds like Trump just rescinded a policy that Biden had put in place.  That's legal. Their right to worship or go to school has not been taken away.  Not sure what their basis for suing is.  They should be contacting their congressman to get the law updated.  Policies come and go at the whim of whoever is in office.,GarlicPheonix,2025-04-29T13:52:47,-4
Constitutional rights do not become optional just because something something immigration.  What a joke. People are eager to give Trump a Get-Out-of-the-Constitution-Free card.,Logical_Hare,2025-04-29T14:04:28,3
"Yeah, this has been settled in the US for decades. People are so eager to give up their rights if they have a chance to hurt others.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-29T14:12:09,1
"What constitutional rights are being infringed?  They are free to practice their religion, assemble, and say anything they want.  Honestly not understanding your argument.  The only change is a policy Biden put in place that said churches and school were essentially safe zones is no longer policy.  Everyone still has all of their constitutional rights.",GarlicPheonix,2025-04-29T14:17:17,-1
