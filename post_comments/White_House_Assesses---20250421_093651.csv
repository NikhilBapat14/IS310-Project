"Listen. I’m just going to rip this bandaid off. The US will never be a country that women will want to bring more children into. You’re never going to get the living wage, the healthcare, the childcare, the affordable housing, the economic stability that you need and that the baby boomers had. (There’s a reason they are called baby boomers; because America was a great place to have children when they were of reproductive relevance.)  Aside from the fact that women and couples can’t afford children or can’t mortally bring themselves to have children in this American hell, a lot of folks also just don’t want kids. Even if they could afford it and America was a safe, thriving country, they still just don’t kids. It’s just not their thing.   I know we make a lot of Gilead jokes but it’s not impossible. It might not be as crazy as The Handmaid’s Tale but after our government refuses to give young people the things that they need to safely and affordably raise a child and realizes that a lot of young people just don’t want kids anyway, they’re going to get aggressive about it.

And the medical community does not give a flying fuck about the life term pain and chronic conditions that can come after a pregnancy or birth. If more money was poured into preventing or treating these complications, it would be more appealing to some.  Also, it's expensive, time consuming, no one has money. Too many adult men act like children so then you have to parent a man child and a child child. You get to work full time and do the job of a full time housewife. What a treat.

"„The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values.  One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children.  Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery.  A third calls on the government to fund programs that educate women on their menstrual cycles — in part so they can better understand when they are ovulating and able to conceive.“",Morgentau7,2025-04-21T09:37:20,9

"Getting men to help with taking care of the kids and the home such that the mother doesn't have all the burden of it would help a lot for starters. After all, Western developed countires with more equal burden between both fathers and mothers in taking care of children tend to have higher birth rates than socially traditional yet developed countries where the mother is expected to take care of the kids. For comparison, you can compare Finland's birth rate where fathers have parental leave alongside the women that's being used more relatively, and Korea where the hierarchical patriarchal society where the mother is expected to take care of a child. Both are countries with a similar gdp per capita, both are countries that industrialized more recently (in Finland's case it was heavily agrarian until urbanisation during the 1950s-1960s with large scale emigration as result of a lack of jobs when agriculture automated), both have relatively militarized societies owing to a neighbor deemed a threat with mandatory conscription, and both have ageing societies.

"Oh yeah, they also tell you parents have no right to give their children gender affirming care. So in this case, the parents and the doctors DON'T know what is best for the patient... interesting how that flips.",rote_Fuechsin,2025-04-22T18:03:24,1
"No, banning abortion in the way the US has will cause less babies. Women are being arrested for having miscarriages, which are extremely common. If abortion is illegal in a circumstance where you need one due to an ectopic or other non-completable pregnancy you cannot get one, which is extremely life threatening for the person who is pregnant.  If something goes wrong, even if the pregnancy is wanted, the government could prosecute you or let you die.   All of this causes an increased fear over becoming pregnant. Leading those who may want to have kids to not out of fear. ",[deleted],2025-04-21T11:07:06,21
