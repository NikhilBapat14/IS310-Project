Trump cut a $25,000 check to a political committee supporting Bondi from his family’s charitable foundation, in violation of legal prohibitions against charities supporting partisan political activities. After the check came in, Bondi’s office nixed suing Trump’s company for fraud, citing insufficient grounds to proceed. Both Trump and Bondi denied wrongdoing.  Two days before being sworn in as president in January 2017, Trump paid $25 million to settle three lawsuits alleging Trump University defrauded its students.

"They aren’t. People are prioritizing. They are looking at paying their power bill. Keeping the water running. Getting their kid new shoes (again). Trying to keep the car running for another year. Trying to keep their job.   The lower middle class and the poor have been struggling with these things.  And while many of them are uneducated, they aren’t any dumber than the wealthy or upper middle class.   They may have been forced to drop out of school to work, or because they didn’t see the point. If you can make $20/hr at the machine shop or on the construction site why would you bother finishing high school? Could be up to $30/hr if you make foreman.  So when they hear Obama talking about investing in education, they shut down. When they see Biden stammering or mixing up words, they lose patience. These rich city democrats they see everywhere - they don’t seem passionate about anything. They don’t care.  But Trump, even though most of them see him as a guy they don’t really believe about everything, he’s got the same flaws they do. He’s not a high class guy despite his wealth, he eats fast food and drinks Diet Coke. He talks like they do. He doesn’t tell them that they have to go to college to have a good life.  And yeah, with just a BIT of research they’d be able to see he’s full of shit. But what’s the point? They already feel like the democrats let them down. The GOP has told them the democrats care more about transwomen in sports than about them. That they want abortions for 12 year olds. That they don’t care about our troops.  The GOP PR machine is SO MUCH BETTER than the Democrat attempts. Because simplicity is the key and these issues are too complicated to be made simple if you’re being honest. We DO have immigration issues, but the solution isn’t a stupid wall. We DO have government bloat issues, but the solution isn’t firing everybody.  But the real solutions take more than 10 words to explain, and politics is about 10 word answers.  These people aren’t all stupid. They’re just tired. They’re jaded. They’re cynical. And they’re pissed. And Trump slid right into that mold perfectly.   So they can’t read as well - it’s not a skill they’ve had to develop. Reading text messages and social media posts is about the only thing they have to use it for. They don’t read books for pleasure. “Who has that kinda time, anyway?” They’d ask.   But let’s not just assume they’re all stupid. They’re not. Some of these people can do jobs you or I can’t. When tasked their problem solving skills would shock a lot of people. Some of these people have just decided that if they aren’t gonna get a fair shot at the success they were promised, then fuck it, restart the whole fucking system.
