"[Yes, he can](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C1-3-1/ALDE_00013316/).  No there is no balance.",lulfas,2024-11-15T10:55:40,26
"Can he? Yes.   However, this does not erase criminal convictions  https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions  So you are still a convicted felon after a pardon, you just don't have to serve out your sentence anymore. This will make it hard for the majority of them to lead normal lives moving forward as it will remain on their record.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-15T21:47:32,2
"They have to accept guilt in order to be pardoned. Trump could offer clemency, that still excludes them from many jobs and countries.   https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/clemency",seanosul,2024-11-15T11:44:42,2
Your source does not match your analysis.  There are some court cases and requirements to execute a pardon.,AuditorTux,2024-11-15T10:59:21,-12

"From the first answer ""  a full pardon granted by the President and accepted by its subject  prevents or removes any of the penalties and disabilities consequent upon conviction . . . . In several nineteenth-century cases, the Supreme Court suggested that a pardon broadly obviates all legal guilt of the offender, effectively erasing the crime from existence.""  So guilt is irrelevant i think.",juzwunderin,2024-11-15T14:15:16,8
"If there is a specific limitation from the source you think constrains trump wrt the specific topic - pardoning 1/6 rioters from federal charges or convictions - please cite it.  Because I've gone through it and I see nothing.  If trump wishes to follow through with his promise to pardon them, he can do so as soon as he takes office and there are no relevant court cases or requirements to prevent him from doing so.",DrunkenBriefcases,2024-11-15T15:42:47,11
"Not sure why you injected that opion -disagreement -here.. the question was can the President pardon those in involved in January 6 events.. the answer is yes if they are charged with Federal crimes, unless they are  related to impeachment.",juzwunderin,2024-11-15T14:10:10,8
Confused as to why you’re even arguing about this. Objectively speaking they were correct: on the question of “Can Trump pardon the J6 insurrectionists?” The question is Yes. We can be pedantic about procedural issues but that’s not really the point of the question…,[deleted],2024-11-17T13:00:48,1
"Agreed, the primary one being the implicit acceptance of guilt. They can accept clemency but that still leaves issues with going to other countries and many jobs   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdick_v._United_States",seanosul,2024-11-15T11:49:28,-1
"I disagree. Maybe their family and friends won't but it will make employment more difficult. Granted, it's not like most of them were going to ever make it to Goldman Sachs, Black Rock, or a Magnificent 7 (well maybe Tesla) job but still.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-16T17:35:24,1
The pardon removes the guilt but its prerequisite is the acceptance of guilt.,seanosul,2024-11-15T15:45:53,0
">pardoning 1/6 rioters from federal charges or convictions - please cite it.  There's never been a ""mass pardon"" like he's claiming and there is a statutory process to be followed in issuing pardons.  That's what I meant when he said there was no balance.  Now, he could try and do a mass pardon and fight it up through the courts, but that would take longer than doing, say, five a day.",AuditorTux,2024-11-15T15:45:41,-1
"Specifically that the President can't pardon someone being impeached.  He could still pardon the criminal offense, but the impeachment process wouldn't be affected.  Not that that's relevant here.",gsfgf,2024-11-15T17:53:20,2
"What other nations think of or how they decide to treat pardon recipients from the US isn't really relevant to the question of ""can trump pardon them?""  The answer is: yes.  Other nations determine how they treat foreign citizens.  But there is no ""different department"" in the US ""to balance out"" the President's pardon power.  And the few limitations involved here - he can only pardon federal charges/convictions, can't pardon a future crime, etc. do not constrain trump's intent in this case.",DrunkenBriefcases,2024-11-15T15:51:40,3
"Can you cite, from federal juris prudence or federal code where a presidential commute or pardon requires a plea or open pleading of guilt? I personally know a man who was in the army and received a pardon from Trump while serving a sentence at Leavenworth and has never plead guilty.  Edit-- I am not going to argue your wrong because I don't know for a fact, but I find it highly dubious so asking for supporting information.",juzwunderin,2024-11-15T17:08:05,3

Understand and completely agree .,juzwunderin,2024-11-15T18:25:13,1
"The Supreme Court has said that the acceptance of a pardon is an admission of guilt. You do not need to admit to guilt prior to receiving the pardon, and there's dispute over whether that passage is an actual holding of the court or just dicta. And quite frankly, it is utterly irrelevant and has zero real world ramifications. Once the act is pardoned, it's pardoned.",cptjeff,2024-11-15T18:49:47,4

"Ok, I can get on board with that-- as I can see how a court could come to that conclusion. And I also agree it's completely irrelevant at that point. Appreciate it, thanks.",juzwunderin,2024-11-15T18:53:18,2
There is a difference between commuting a sentence and pardoning of a sentence because the pardon removes the crime for the purpose of travel and employment.,seanosul,2024-11-15T19:32:41,1
