The way he’s literally decomposing right in front of us - I wouldn’t be surprised if he just wanders out in nothing but an open bathrobe and announces “the new-new secretary of energy is my very good friend Billy Bob Thornton - but only as Bad Santa and only from at the start of the movie when he was cool” before shitting on the floor and goosing his daughter.,karatebullfightr,2025-05-08T23:43:49,1

"I don't care. The comment was intentionally misleading.  Your past and qualifications don't disappear because you havent done it in 20 years when you were extremely successful.  You don't have to like her or believe her, but she is most certainly qualified for the requirements the role seeks.",UsefulTrouble24,2025-05-08T19:04:10,-9
"Extremely successful is a stretch. She advanced from local assistant district attorney to local district attorney over the course of seventeen years, then stopped practicing law to become a propagandist   Sure, she’s officially qualified. The qualifications are literally having a J.D. and good standing with any bar association—in other words, being a lawyer.   She’s still a lawyer, she’s just not a good one. Will it matter? Probably not, because she won’t be doing any real legal work anyway.",409yeager,2025-05-08T19:24:42,11
