"“Don’t tase me, bro!”  In 2007, a moment that would go viral long before social media had the power it does today occurred at a John Kerry speech at the University of Florida. The incident itself was captured on [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bVa6jn4rpE) and spread rapidly across the internet. Meyer, a 21-year-old communications student, was attempting to ask Kerry about the controversial 2004 presidential election and the role of the media. His microphone was cut off as he spoke, and he was soon surrounded by police officers who began to forcibly remove him from the event. As Meyer struggled, one of the officers deployed a Taser on him, causing him to scream, “Don’t tase me, bro!” The phrase was instantly popularized, becoming a symbol of overreach by authority figures, particularly in the context of law enforcement and college campus protests.",kuzism,2025-05-07T04:27:12,49

"I'm super left and very anti-Trump. I preface with that because this will probably get downvoted.  This headline is BS. Her offense (and removal) was not for asking the question. It was for yelling over his answer, which she didn't like, because it was deflective and avoided the question.  Fair enough, but she violated the rules of the event in doing so, and was intentionally disruptive and interrupting his answer with her yelling.  No, there is no first amendment issue here. This is a private event. You don't have a first amendment right to be disruptive at a private event, *even if that event is with your elected representative*.  Yes, they can trespass her/ask her to leave, for any reason or no reason at all. If she refuses, they have every right to have police physically remove her.  Don't get me wrong; if you wanted to stage a non-violent protest, this is an EXCELLENT way to do it. Ask your representatives these questions at every single opportunity and don't let them get away with evading the answer without calling that out too.  But do NOT whine about getting carted off afterwards or make up some bullshit about your first amendment rights being violated, because they weren't. You were intentionally disruptive to non-violently protest the current state of things, and were then legally removed from a private event for trespass.  Your focus at that point should be on the message and the protest, not on pretending you were victimized. If you are unable to accept the perfectly legal consequences of staging a non-violent protest in this kind of context then don't fucking do it.  Protest in good faith with a strong message and don't whine about the predictable and LEGAL consequences.  Let people see the thin skinned over-reaction of the representative for what it is without resorting to invalid complaints about your not-actually-violated first amendment rights or the basic legal process of trespassing a private venue, which only serves to undermine your message and make you look stupid and insincere.",nezroy,2025-05-07T12:26:02,-8

"I’ve been thinking about this a little while. We shouldn’t have to treat elections as a fucking emergency. Citizens have very little power even as we vote to change things, we can lose. We can protest, or could, we could write or speak directly to our own representatives, who may be outnumbered and rendered powerless: their vote for what we want is outnumbered or bypassed by the executive idiot plotting his dictatorship. Other representatives are beholden to their constituents to let this happen.   If we’re against something the government is doing to represent the people, what little can we even do to change their mind?  You can’t change trumps mind, maybe with a lot more money than he’s been given to be the Hitler wannabe he is being, you can swing him all the way left! I’m tired of blaming people for doing what they feel they need to do to send the only message they think they can. There’s only power in money and apparently the only way to get and keep enough money to buy the government, you have to be a shitty greedy person like they are and envision the world how they want the world to be, starting with fucking our democracy and dehumanizing people in it and all over the world.   Sorry to say this was going to happen even if Harris won. Or Biden.

"Are you aware of the context of my response?  The original commenter—who seems to misunderstand the structure and function of U.S. state and local governance—suggested,  'This should motivate people to swarm these town halls for disruptive purposes and set these clowns up for a pay-out at the same time.'  While individuals whose civil rights are legitimately violated may be entitled to compensation, encouraging disruption solely to provoke such outcomes is unethical and counterproductive. Moreover, any financial settlements resulting from these actions are paid by taxpayers, not the officials themselves. Draining public resources in this way ultimately harms the very communities such protests claim to support.  **TL;DR:** My point isn’t about who *should* pay—it's that, as things stand, taxpayers *are* paying, and that makes this approach a bad idea.  Also, I don’t believe taxpayers should be held financially responsible for official misconduct—if an individual is found guilty of corruption, the burden and cost majority should fall on them, not the public.",sydiko,2025-05-07T17:13:43,2

"> There’s no room for a protest vote in a district represented by a republican   You can certainly state that like it's a fact, but it doesn't mean it's actually true.  Since NY awards all electoral votes to the statewide popular vote winner, the presidential outcome of any individual district is ultimately irrelevant to who wins NY's electoral votes. Congressional elections and presidential elections are separate systems. The fact this district has a Republican representative is a distinct issue that's unrelated to how this woman chose to use her presidential vote.  It's completely fine if you fundamentally disagree with protest voting. I have no interest in changing your mind if that's how you feel. However, suggesting there's ""no room"" for her protest vote in the presidential election just because her district isn't blue isn't a compelling argument when the margin was over a million votes in Harris's favor. As I said originally, as far as protest votes go, this situation was probably one of the least dangerous ways to lodge a protest vote against the democratic establishment without supporting the opposition.  Out of curiosity, let's say we hypothetically found out that she voted for Jones and not Lawler in the congressional election, are you still upset at her protest vote? If you are, do you think someone who voted for both Harris and Lawler made a better or worse choice than this woman?  ​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‌‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‍",daedalusesq,2025-05-07T21:05:14,3
