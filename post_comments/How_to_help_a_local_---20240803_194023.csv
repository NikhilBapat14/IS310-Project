"The two things campaigns need that a person can give them are money and time. Money can buy them ads, staff, polling, printer paper, etc. Time is volunteering. Volunteering would be coordinated through their campaign office, not something you just randomly do on their own.   The easiest way would be to go to their campaign website (if they're a serious candidate they will have one, forget about them if they don't) and click 'volunteer' or 'get involved' or something like that. You could do anything from phone banking to knocking on doors, distributing signs, setting up events.   If you're familiar with them you could just reach out to them directly, but if they're busy they might just refer you to the volunteer link or just give you their volunteer director's phone number.   Talking to your friends and family and the candidate and encouraging those who will be adults during the election to register to vote would be helpful. If you figure out the process yourself you can just send them a link to make it easier for them too.",colorfulpony,2024-08-05T19:39:26,2
