"In the interview he did with Welker, where she asked him if his ""2 dolls instead of 30"" comment meant higher prices, he said no, he's actually lowering prices, including gas below $2.00 a gallon (that of course, is a pure fiction). So she asked him, ""Does that mean shelves will be empty?"" He said no, shelves will be full. Kids will have to make do with fewer dolls and pencils just because they need to learn to do with less.  The man can't talk his way out of a box, yet some people still think he's a brilliant businessman. When asked why people will have to do with less, if it's not the price or availability, he has no answer. Because he's absolutely clueless. We've known this since the '80's, but it was fun to pretend he was a genius real estate mogul, so his celebrity grew.

">“That means we lose less money, you know? When I see that, that means we lose less money,” Trump replied. He claimed that China had been making “over a trillion, 1.1 trillion, in my opinion.”  And the fact that not a single reporter in the room interrupted him to say, ""we are not interested in your opinion, show us the evidence,"" is a good demonstration of exactly why Trump is being allowed to ruin people's lives.

If a young girl knows that she's not important enough to deserve as many toys as the boys get, then when she grows up she will know that she's not important enough to have the right to say 'no' to an unwanted advance.

"I think we should rebrand schools, repaired roads, safe airports, universal healthcare, etc. as ""ROI on your tax dollars"".  Not socialism - it's a Return On Investment of your hard-earned tax dollars, working for ***you***!  Mention that farmers and oil men get a nice ROI on their tax dollars through subsidies, and Joe Average should, too.  At least it would be hard to refute.",sowhat4,2025-05-08T18:31:58,12
"That is exactly what it is. Healthcare is a big one as people don't realize insurance is more or less the same thing BUT with an expensive middleman. Universal healthcare may end up in slightly higher taxes, but that is offset by not needing to pay executives for the privilege of getting an x-ray.",Frowny575,2025-05-08T22:50:23,2
"I partially agree with this.   I think the problem is that there is a lot of non transparency into how taxes are spent, and a lot of questions over whether there is price gouging, mishandling of funds, or even strait up theft.   There are well known stories like the “600 dollar hammer” that lead people to question whether their taxes are 1) actually being used for what they’re supposed to be and 2) whether contractors are gouging the government     That gouging is theft - from us.   If there was a lot more transparency into accounting at the local, state, and federal levels people would be a lot more trusting. Hell - that’s our money, I think all of that accounting should be public.",counterweight7,2025-05-09T06:27:27,2
