the colossal stupidity of trump and his clown car continues to be utterly infinite,ElPlywood,2025-05-07T20:37:34,25
I can understand being a climate change denier to a certain extent... perhaps you're that dumb.   But... to have an absolute HATE for anything environmentally supportive is something I will never understand.,mxpower,2025-05-07T20:46:27,14
The modern GOP has managed to have the worst take on literally every aspect of society.  And they won.,E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-07T20:33:27,19
I'm sure the 'ol Texas power grid will be fine.,showme_yourdogs,2025-05-07T21:08:41,5
I ran across this cutting edge washing device. It requires no energy star rating... And it's made in the US! So no tariffs!   Your all welcome: [https://columbuswashboard.com/collections/washboards?srsltid=AfmBOoroLxV-uX1fbMGn7xJNqZ35VjKiyeWWwidGASwihJZ86UVSpZb7](https://columbuswashboard.com/collections/washboards?srsltid=AfmBOoroLxV-uX1fbMGn7xJNqZ35VjKiyeWWwidGASwihJZ86UVSpZb7)  And I'm told it's a fantastic device for washing bootstraps.,williamgman,2025-05-07T21:27:41,5
Anything that helps the average American is being undone by Trump... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-07T20:59:30,4
"Probably just going to replace it with the Power of America program, privately owned of course.",34luck,2025-05-08T03:30:40,3

Gotta create more energy demand that only oil can fulfill.,struggle2win,2025-05-07T22:24:30,2
This has saved America taxpayers hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. This is another “fuck you” to US citizens,Snapdragon_4U,2025-05-07T20:51:46,19
I can probably hit that level of hate but I'm going to have to reach for it. The best I can offer is general apathy towards the future.,Huckleberry-V,2025-05-07T21:12:13,-1
"Well they’ve built their base out of whatever the bot farms were successful at getting interactions with. Now that the most inflammatory topics get the most attention that’s their foundation.   Not entirely related to US politics, but this is a great watch to get a better understanding of what has been going on:  https://youtu.be/_972Y8iwrX8?si=F4QgZ9f_e2L0xBaG",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T20:42:16,5
That was a good read. I admire their longevity and adherence to history while also saying expanding into other areas knowing that washboards are not in high demand. I appreciate that. They're trying to keep a homegrown American company alive and I'm sure their local community does too. ,Fit-Examination-2156,2025-05-07T21:50:42,1
"If I'm not mistaken, appliance manufacturers are very much in favor of the Energy Star program and fought Trump during his last term when he tried to end the program.",walkallover1991,2025-05-07T21:12:18,9
Plus: BONUS! This hurts average taxpayers.,Snapdragon_4U,2025-05-07T23:42:09,2
Many billions. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-07T20:59:54,9
There's probably more sold as instruments than for actual washing.,confused_ape,2025-05-08T04:44:37,3
It's really just a volunteer labeling program. The manufacturers like it because it helps them advertise energy/cost savings which encourages people to buy newer models.,zulruhkin,2025-05-07T21:40:13,5
Now they can just put 6 Star on everything,Swuzzlebubble,2025-05-07T21:53:17,0
