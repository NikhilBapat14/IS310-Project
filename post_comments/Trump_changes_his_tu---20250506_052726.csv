"They haven't specified what happens after this ""transition period"" of scarce dolls and pencils. What is this sacrifice for? What's the endgame? That we'll all have assembly-line jobs at the new 1950s-style American factories making dolls and pencils? Is the payoff related to the tariff revenue? Is that going to be used in some way to improve lives?  Why would his supporters make the sacrifice without having a reason?

"It's a designation of the hardness of a graphite pencil.  Traditional (non-digital) artists use them to get a very wide range. Another comment gave a good example of the range.  The ones with a 'B' are softer & darker.  The ones with 'H' are harder & lighter.  Pencil artists end up with a lot of them since you normally wear through some quicker than others.  A basic set of these are considered a required supply in most foundational art classes and they're already very expensive.  Supply costs are often a roadblock to children really getting into traditional art.  As for the colored pencils bit... colored pencil artists (even just hobbyists) will often have hundreds (if not thousands) of pencils in every shade imaginable, and actually do need a huge range to make the art they do.    In both cases, the cheap version of these pencils often are already broken or a very poor quality to the point of just frustrating learners.  If the most reliable brands are priced out of reach, or if someone in power truly doesn't understand why that many are needed, fine arts are going to suffer even more than they already are.  Availability is already a challenge in some areas, and they don't ship particularly well as some have very fragile lead.  Even with the move to largely digital art, most of these artists still had foundational art classes or self instruction using these traditional mediums because they teach foundational & observational skills and help develop the fine motor control needed.",TeaOk2254,2025-05-06T06:35:44,5
