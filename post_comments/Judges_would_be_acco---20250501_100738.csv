"The privilege of resigning to avoid accountability is reserved only for the likes of congressmembers like Matt Gaetz, say Republican congressmembers.",CJ4ROCKET,2025-05-01T10:32:51,23
"This seems like a long overdue bill with noble intention. It should be easy to get bipartisan support for it. But I predict that the GOP congress will be too busy pushing their own version of judicial reform legislation. Punishing judges who uphold the Constitution in disagreement with the current administration or not wanting ICE to disrupt court proceedings, for instance.   Unless it gets rewritten to include protections for the Republican Party, lowly interns will get little discussion. IMO the GOP is looking for issues that interest their constituents to bring up before the midterms instead.",nativerestorations1,2025-05-01T12:06:33,7
"I wonder if this would also apply to Trump's sister? I think she resigned after the news came out about ripping off her other brother's family when they settled Fred Trump's estate, though maybe she was exposed for some other sleazy behavior.",edmerx54,2025-05-01T11:27:56,2
"They would now all be responsible if the new bill passes no?  Then we just need to make sure there is a next election to put every last one behind bars, no exception.",Individual_Space4533,2025-05-01T11:19:10,2
"Anytime these politicians at the Federal level introduce legislation I always ask; Do the same laws already apply in the State they represent?  I’m not familiar with Georgia law, but here in NY we’ve had legislation that would hold Judges accountable for ignoring Child Abuse stuck in the Senate for several years. Our Democratic Leadership runs around claiming “no one is above the law” while actively stalling to end Immunity for our Judges.",SaltyinCNY,2025-05-01T12:40:24,2

"No. Post-facto laws are inherently illegal, and should stay that way. You do not want to open the can of worms where governments can criminalize an activity that was once legal with retroactive punishment. Even if it would be sweet to see the love child of Bevis and Butthead put behind bars, the consequences of allowing post-facto laws to reign will not be worth.",MasterSpoon,2025-05-01T19:29:32,1
