What kind of sick mind games is he trying to pull?,random_anonymous_guy,2025-05-08T14:43:24,74
"He says this, expecting the bill to fail for other reasons, and now he can blame the Democrats for blocking a tax increase on the rich.",BlotchComics,2025-05-08T14:45:20,67

"> “It is unbelievable that House Republicans are seriously considering raising taxes on anyone, and at the same time refusing to eliminate the trillions of dollars in waste from Joe Biden’s Green New Scam,” Americans for Prosperity Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner said in a statement on Thursday.  I didn't think it was possible but this dude's even worse than Trump.  What's ""Joe Biden’s Green New Scam"" and where are the ""trillions of dollars in waste?""",NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-08T15:03:30,7
"If he was serious, he'd have signed an executive order to at least keep up the pretence of giving a damn. Since he's only asking, he definitely doesn't mean it.",coyylol,2025-05-08T14:55:13,5

"He knows his popularity is in the toilet so he's offering his usual inducement- money, to pander to us.

Essentially just adding one percent and retaining the rate from 2013. Wow. Would be bad bad news if those fellas also didn’t own all the assets that have 10Xd since then. Nothing will happen.,MrGlockCLE,2025-05-08T14:46:55,5

This is the same trick Clinton pulled. But even weaker. Not that many Americans even make over 2.5 million in WAGE income. Its gonna come instead in capital gains where they are taxed far far lower.    By cutting corporate taxes they will make millions or billions more in capital gains. While paying nothing in wage taxes    Maybe some very specialized employees will pay a tiny more in taxes. But it won't be much at all. And the wealthy will be far better off with their massive corporate income tax cuts   This is one of many reasons the Clinton's should have been kicked out of the dem party. Their shenanigans shouldn't have been rewarded as now Trump plans on using them too,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-08T17:18:35,1

Many House Republicans will balk at it because it raises taxes--even if only for those making over 2.5 million.,fxkatt,2025-05-08T15:04:46,1
I tend to think any tax increase on rich proposal that gets voted on - dems should vote for it- they will never be able to get a tax increase passed themselves.,Melodic_Amphibian_78,2025-05-08T17:28:34,1

It’s not lying as much as he just wants to put the phrase his word is law. That’s why he’s fine with raising taxes in theory. He isn’t for the gop platform because he agrees with it.
