"When Warren Buffett says tariffs are ""an act of war,"" maybe it’s time to stop pretending they’re a flex. The world’s richest investor just called the bluff.",Kitchen_Bicycle4339,2025-05-03T10:42:05,9
"Right, plus the only way tariffs even slightly make sense is when the product is already created in the US at a high enough volume to be provided to Americans, so tariffs on everything that isn't made here? Just hurting Americans and American businesses for no reason.",FlyingRock,2025-05-03T10:50:38,6

">The world’s richest investor just called the bluff.  He did it months ago when he sold his stocks in a Chinese car company and a Taiwanese computer chip making company.    >The first-quarter GDP was just reported to have contracted for the first time since 2022.  >Berkshire said in its first-quarter earnings report that tariffs and other geopolitical events created “considerable uncertainty” for the conglomerate. The firm said it’s not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time.  >Buffett has been in a defensive mode, selling stocks for 10 straight quarters. Berkshire dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire’s two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. As a result of the selling spree, Berkshire’s enormous pile of cash grew to yet another record, at $347 billion at the end of March.",tech57,2025-05-03T11:22:26,5
Yup. Trump and Republicans missed an important step. Right when Democrats worked around Republican sabotage to start re-shoring industry and jobs.  So maybe Trump and Republicans didn't miss that step and just don't actually care about the daily lives of Americans. Tough call. /s     >Just hurting Americans and American businesses for no reason.  Money. Money is the reason. Trump has lived his entire life in luxury and not one day in jail. Poor people don't have that luxury. Because they don't have the money.,tech57,2025-05-03T11:16:07,2

Warren Buffet  is an odd case of billionaires as he has consistently called on higher corporate taxes and more progressive tax policies while calling out the rising costs and worse conditions for average people. Also despite his massive wealth he lives like a normal person. He has one relatively average house in Omaha that he has owned since the 50s and drives a used Cadillac xts (which was used when he bought it). Even sold his vacation home in Florida like a decade ago (again a relatively normal thing doe someone of the upper middle class of the 50s 60s to have). He did have a private jet that he hated (presumably bought due to having to do a lot of flights out of Omaha) but that has been sold in favor of just using the company jets. Like the man is incredibly wealthy but does seem to understand normal people and not exploit the system like all the other billionaires. Just that he made longterm good investments and built up his massive portfolio over half a century with the rise of the market as a whole. So Warren Buffet is I would say somewhat able to speak as a rich yet relatively normal American (albeit from Omaha so regional biases),cjh42,2025-05-03T11:36:29,1
He is telling it like it is while also getting ready to clean everyone out after what he's warning everyone comes to pass.  Manufacturing isnt coming back to the US. Its not just the factories but the supply chain being non existant stateside.,littleemp,2025-05-03T11:38:18,1
I just feel like there's more money if he actually brought industry back and allowed American to be able to *afford* his grift.,FlyingRock,2025-05-03T12:07:10,1
"They way the system is set up is that the government would have to pay CEOs to re-shore. There's no way around that. It would also take longer than you think. Plus, Republicans just spent 4 years sabotaging all efforts to re-shore.  Trump wants fame and fortune now. Not 20 years from now.   Plus, AI and humanoid robots are happening. Times have changed. China has dark factories because there's no lights because there's no human workers that need lights to see. One Chinese company just built a factory that is bigger than San Francisco, will employ more people than the population of Des Moines, Iowa, and still all those workers will be replaced with robots soon.    USA is now getting around to have EVs all use the same charge plug.",tech57,2025-05-04T08:04:01,1
"It depends on the industry, for instance a new filament warehouse just opened in the US, we could encourage more of those, aerospace, Intel and many other companies were ramping up US factories before Trump, those could be bolstered.  Instead of tanking them.",FlyingRock,2025-05-04T09:12:36,1
"Which industry has zero dependency on other countries? Why would that even matter at all?   >we could encourage more of those, aerospace, Intel and many other companies were ramping up US factories before Trump, those could be bolstered  Democrats tried.  >Plus, Republicans just spent 4 years sabotaging all efforts to re-shore.",tech57,2025-05-04T10:04:00,1
