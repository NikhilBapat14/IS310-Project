"True.  Also, Newsom arguing that the President of the United States rounding up people and throwing them in a foreign hellhole prison without due process is a distraction is objectively and significantly worse and more disqualifying than Biden's debate performance, and there's no argument to the contrary.",kneeco28,2025-04-30T09:44:05,13
Mentally compromised Biden was taking better care of the country than normal functioning Trump.,Bruce-7891,2025-04-30T09:39:58,17
But somehow didn't know that hosting Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast would kill his presidential ambitions.,Penguin_Sushi,2025-04-30T09:38:01,8
Isn't this dude busy normalizing conversations with Steve Bannon on his new podcast?,0002millertime,2025-04-30T09:37:41,7
Congrats. Everyone with a brain knew it way before then.   Gavin Newsom is such a loser,DifferenceAlarmed45,2025-04-30T09:39:25,6

Biden would have won against Trump imo.  One bad debate isn’t a deal breaker. Especially give the guy was fucking sick during the debate.  I think pulling him from the ballot was stupid and served to alienate those that had voted in the primaries for him only to be removed.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-30T09:39:45,-1

The corpse of Biden would be doing a better job,fafatzy,2025-04-30T09:41:00,11
"Yeah, but it was pretty clear he was going to lose. Agreeing to a debate he didn’t have to do when he was going to perform like that was a campaign-ending blunder.",meTspysball,2025-04-30T09:51:38,4
That's because the presidency isn't actually one person. The team they bring with them is far more important.,Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-30T10:10:52,2

Biden lost the internal DNC support. He was done.,Fenix42,2025-04-30T10:19:05,3
Dems psyched themselves out so bad. Blows my mind that they forced him out.,Moth-of-Asphodel,2025-04-30T11:50:38,1

"Yep.  I said I didn't care if Biden's brainstem was taped to a broomstick, he would still get my vote and would be a better president...",utriptmybitchswitch,2025-04-30T10:38:26,6

"I know, but I'm pointing out how bad Trump really is. Biden sitting there eating ice cream and watching Family Matters reruns is better than Trump screwing up the economy with tariffs and turning all of our allies against us.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-30T10:58:53,1
They also claimed a lot of other crazy shit that is not true at all.,Fenix42,2025-04-30T10:19:46,4
