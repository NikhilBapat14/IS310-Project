"Of course, they want to get rid of it....it makes voting fair.  Here's a video and info from [fairvote.org](http://fairvote.org) (nonpartisan):  [https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/](https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/)",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-29T19:50:13,18
"............You know what?..........Yeah, I'm actually glad that they are bringing this up now. I personally think that it needs to be launched into the national conversation sooner than later because it is such a great idea to implement it wherever possible and ASAP...at least where it can pass for now at the individual state level.  ...However.............What I am afraid of is that the discourse against it has its strongest backers for the next few years at least in the highest seats of power and wielding them more aggressively than ever before. The resources thrown behind the anti-RCV propaganda will probably overwhelm people and make them not care about learning about it and realizing what a great idea it is.  ...Godamm\*1. We just can't have nice things.",JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-29T19:55:49,10

I don't see many Dems supporting Ranked Choice.  They aren't trying to ban it but I see no real support for it.,SwampYankeeDan,2025-04-30T09:08:44,1
