"It's ridiculous and it just got worse yesterday.  It's the GOP - we didn't like the vote so we're just gonna throw a bunch of them out.    If they succeed it'll be the new playbook nationwide.  For those that don't know North Carolina still has a supreme court race that is undeclared from November 2024     (The only one in the country).  The loser Republican Griffen lost by around 700 votes.  Confirmed with several hand recounts.    So rather than concede, he's trying to toss over 60,000 votes, because their registrations didn't have information required as of 2023.  The fact is, he's not saying their votes are invalid, he's saying their registrations are invalid.  NC requires an ID to vote, so there's no concern from this group that the people don't exist.  Some of these people have been voting for 60+ years.    The courts Friday have said that if those 60,000+ people want their votes counted, they have 15 days to re-register to vote. The problem is many people don't even realize that their votes could possibly get thrown out because the GOP didn't really tell everybody that their vote was in question.  Oh yeah, and the majority of the people's vote who they are trying to throw out- wow just so happened to be registered Democrats in Democratic strongholds.    (Oh yah btw the votes wouldn't count for that one race.  The rest including president, governor, and the other republicans that one are fine.  For some reason it's just the Supreme Court race).    The North Carolina Democrats are trying.  And if anybody wants to help, they are setting up phone Banks to call those 60,000 voters on Monday, Apr 7, 2025.

Not all voters will still show up to vote if they aren’t excited about at least one option on the ballot unfortunately. I do not think the dems handled the Palestine issue very well at all either. That likely cost us dearly.   We need aggressively progressive politicians, that’s just my 2 cents.",Baked4AllDayZ,2025-04-05T22:57:05,1
"Honestly the most awesome thing at the Hands Off March I attended was going through our little downtown and seeing people walk out of restaurants and shops to join us.  There’s a movement happening and if we want anything to change we have to be visible, we have to be everywhere, and we have to make it constant.  If the news is gonna sane wash everything, we’re going to put the truth on display and call it out in public as much as we possibly can.",KillerKittenInPJs,2025-04-06T00:17:12,3

">Each county runs its own elections, and we have over 3000 nationwide,  That is 3000 possible points of failure.  Are you really certain that *every single county* is completely secure?  The attacker does not need to breach all of those counties.  Just one or a few can be enough.  If just one of those counties gets hacked, it can flip the statewide elections in that state.   If you read about the ""bullet ballots"" in the last national election, you know that there is at least some reason to think it has already happened.",Natoochtoniket,2025-04-06T14:00:56,2

"It's not getting the national attention it should. They literally want to throw out 68,000 votes (at last count) - including military, mail in and early voters (even though they showed ID to vote).   The good news is as of Monday April 7, a stay was put on the 15 day order. And the NC board of elections has confirmed they have the missing information for about 30,000 of the 68,000 votes that are being contested.  (Apparently Some of the data didn't transfer during a system upgrade).    So as of end of day April 7, it's only 38,000 votes the GOP wants to throw out so their guy can win. They are literally using NC as a testing ground to steal elections and disenfranchise voters.  If they win this will become part of the GOP playbook.

"That's reassuring.  But the facts, to me, don't support it.  The very blue states (CA, MD, MA) all showed a decrease in the percentage of victory for Harris.  I don't think those states had much cheating. Since Trump won all the toss-up states it would have to be a whale of a cheating plan.  So if you think they cheated, how would they do it?  There were Dems at all the voting places in the toss-up states.  It's not as easy as you think.  AFAIK the voting machines were not on the internet, to make cheating much harder.",oakpitt,2025-04-05T23:02:03,7

"That part pisses me off the most. The courts know when they are putting an impossibly short amount of time for mailings. There is a county by me that only requires the DA to send mail 2 days before a court date. The judge knows it's not enough time and he laughs at people who didn't make their court date. I made mine bc I called when I didn't get a communication bc at court they said ""I'll set it up with the DA later. They will send you a notice ""  the judge was asking how I got there on time. I ignored and he actually directly asked me if I got my notice. I finally told him I called. And he shook his head. It was for a traffic ticket and he had to dismiss bc he didn't even have a jury there for the trial. He also told me I'm lucky I was early bc otherwise I'd have screwed up his tee time.    They know exactly what they are doing.",Any_Coyote6662,2025-04-06T20:15:44,3
