America’s plan to stop Trump’s power grab seems to relie on the faint hope he gets bored and goes golfing.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-01T17:07:13,22
"Lots of words in this article, but whether or not it said anything, I don’t know. In short, if Trump is unpopular, it’ll be easier for people to stand up to him. No kidding, but that’s not anything people can really do. Otherwise, they basically said to not freak out and overreact to what he does, some of what he is doing is technically legal, and in not overreacting, people can have a better conversation?  If someone got something else from this article, feel free to enlighten me.",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-05-01T17:12:14,8
"> The past 100 days have wounded this country, and there is no guarantee that we will fully recover. But nobody should give up. American democracy retreated before, during the post-Reconstruction era, Jim Crow, the Red Scare, Watergate and other times. It recovered from those periods not because its survival was inevitable but because Americans — including many who disagreed with one another on other subjects — fought bravely and smartly for this country’s ideals. That is our duty today.  -----  Edit: TIL comments including URLs to the usual archive sites are _**apparently**_ removed silently.  Understandable, but silent filtering like this is ... vexing.",drtolmn69,2025-05-01T17:13:43,3

"Old enough to remember when Darth Cheney and W had the whole US Government and Country on lock down after 9/11 with the open Declaration from the White house that ""Youre either with us, or with the terrorists."" and everyone fell in line in Washington.  And that lasted for a few years, until John Stewart and the Daily Show went on the air and started openly mocking all the W administration was doing, and all its illegal wars and powergrabs for corporations like Halliburton and the Petrol Companies.   and thats what finally broke the support for W's regime and they become vulnerable to being exposed as having no clothes. Well, that and theyre own greed and overreach for power causing a near economic collapse in 2008...",mynamesyow19,2025-05-01T17:49:53,3

Trump doesn’t care about the actual work of the presidency. I think we could have avoided this is someone had just given him a fake title and a fake reporter to follow him everywhere ,Elegant_Plate6640,2025-05-01T18:28:01,6
"What is sad is that people seem to think it will go away with Trump.  He's not smart enough to do all of this on his own, he showed that the first time. The heritage fundation, behind him are clearly the issue and they will support anyone else. The only option is not to wait for Trump to die or go away but to root out every single one of them, from his administration to the enabling judges (even the scotus ones), to the senators and congress people not impeaching him and.",Shallowmoustache,2025-05-01T18:49:18,4
