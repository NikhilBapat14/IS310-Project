"Protests and rallies work!  I see a lot of grey-hairs like me there because a lot of have seen how effective the Civil-Rights and Vietnam War protests were. Elected representatives depend on the approval of large blocks of people and seeing a bunch of people saying ""I'm not OK with this"" really makes them nervous.  It only takes 1-2 hours to join a rally and help add to the crowd.  I really appreciate these rallies bing on Saturday where possible, so working people like me can attend.  Silence is surrender, it's time to make some noise.",Iowa_Dave,2025-05-03T06:00:01,16
 The new American wanna be dictator can’t send all of out of the country. Don’t comply in advance. Let’s start seriously talking about impeachment.,signerster,2025-05-03T09:51:09,7
"Isn’t this the person who was talking down to all of us saying we can’t figure out what oligarchy means? Like if you know anything about bernie and his message, and hear him say oligarchy is bad, then you can figure it out through context clues. Strategizing in the public by insulting our intelligence is not the way",Ill_Source9620,2025-05-03T10:19:47,0
"While I agree that protests can help, Trump is too aggressive, and will use powers at his fingertips to blast anyone who is even making a hint of progress against his dictatorship.     He’s about shock and awe. Look what he did to the people he sent to El Salvador. There’s people who were not supposed to be sent and they’re still there. Like WTF.",thomport,2025-05-03T06:46:39,-1
The Civil Rights and Vietnam War protests occurred in the 20th century when everyone got their news from the same three and very similar networks.    In the 21st century the media has been much more fragmented and siloed and most people don't even know these protests are happening.    I've been to seven protests so far and they were all overwhelmingly boomers. If you can show any concrete evidence that peaceful protests in the 21st century actually produce concrete results I'd like to see it.    Are Black people in the hands of the police demonstrably safer now than they were before BLM?   Is the status of women any better now after the Women's March?   Is the US doing a better job protecting the environment than we were before the Extinction Rebellion protests?   Have the 1% been taken down a peg or two since Occupy?   I intend to continue going to anti-Trump protests because they're fun and it's nice to be with other people feel the same way I do.   But I see no evidence that peacefully waving placards around has any effect on the Trump administration.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:17:56,0

Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a first-term senator who won a competitive Senate race in Michigan the same year that President Donald Trump won the presidential election there, told Politico that she thinks her party should stop using the term “oligarchy.”",PuffPuffFayeFaye,2025-05-03T14:18:46,3
I agree with the person who said Americans don't know what oligarchy means.   I don't think the average American voter understands words that have more than two syllables.  Did you see who they elected president?    You're probably one of those people who are just **amazed** that Trump is our president and he's doing all these crazy things and getting away with it.   I'm not the least bit amazed because I didn't start off with a very high opinion of the intelligence of the average American voter.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:22:27,1
That's actually good evidence to protests don't work.  If protests actually worked against Trump they wouldn't be allowed.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:23:42,1

"I have yet to see a Democratic politician at any of the seven rallies/protests I went to.   I've written to my congresswoman and to my senators, all Democrats, and received nothing but boilerplate responses.    The Democratic party is worse than useless because many things they do aid and abet the Trump administration",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:42:38,0
