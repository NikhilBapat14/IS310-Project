"The crux of this article focuses on the issue Nixon faced and fell to. The President isn't supposed to be the entire executive branch. This perception that he is, is the nature of this discussion.  Now one could argue he is correct or not but what is more important is the Supreme court is now happy to consider enabling what is illegal or to shield the evidence to determine what is, on political ideology and not the rule of law.  We are all supposed to be equal and this is supposed to have included the President of the United States..  Allowing Trump and the GOP to continue t act like the President can do anything is going to create a huge amount of suffering and death for no other reason then the powers that be can say "" Trump did it "" to excuse their own culpability",RobbyRock75,2025-05-05T14:08:34,1
