Can we stop saying deporting?  You can't be deported if you're a citizen - this is exiling Americans to an El Salvadorian prison.   I'm not a citizen of another country. If I'm kicked out of the US and not allowed back I'm stateless. That's not deportation that's against pretty much every international initiative of the last 3/4 century.

"The House was voting on an amendment that would’ve blocked ICE from using federal funds to detain or deport U.S. citizens. It came up because there’ve been multiple cases where that exact thing has happened—U.S. citizens being mistakenly detained or even deported. Most Democrats voted for it. Most Republicans voted against it, saying existing safeguards are already strong enough.  But honestly, that doesn’t really line up with the facts. Pedro Guzman, a U.S. citizen, was deported to Mexico and ended up missing for 85 days before he was found. Jose Hermosillo was detained for 10 days even though he showed ID—and he has disabilities that made it harder for him to defend himself. And Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, born in Georgia, was arrested and held under Florida’s immigration law. Even the judge admitted she couldn’t let him go right away, despite knowing he was a citizen.  ICE’s own data shows nearly 1,500 U.S. citizens were wrongfully arrested between 2012 and 2018. So it’s not just “rare” or hypothetical—it happens, and it has real consequences. Nobody’s claiming ICE is doing it intentionally, but clearly, more protections are still needed. This amendment was just trying to make sure taxpayer money isn’t used to violate the rights of actual American citizens.",c0rnnut007,2025-05-02T16:58:23,10

"‘Deporting’ is misinformation. Deportation by definition cannot be done to a citizen in their own country. A better definition would be: ‘forced displacement,’ or even ‘human trafficking,’ depending on how you look at it.   Forced displacement (from [European Commission](https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-forced-displacement/forced-displacement_en)): when movement from a home country is involuntary or coerced, though this doesn’t specify a party actively transporting said person.   Human trafficking (from [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/human-trafficking.html)): transportation of people through force, fraud, or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. This typically has a sexual connotation, and there is the question of how this can be seen as exploitation of the people being transported.

"No one deporting us citizens. When parents who in the US illegally and who have US citizen minors gets deported, they have a choice: to take kids with them or to leave kids in the US(to relatives or foster care). And if they choice to bring kids with them, kids get free ride at government expense. With that amendment parents still would have this choice, but if they decide to bring kids with them, they would have to pay for kids plane tickets themselves, because the amendment explicitly prohibits the use of government funds for this purpose. And if they haven't money to purchase plane ticket they have no choice but leave kids in the US. Family separation, when family doesn't want to, is bad right? But it getting even worse: Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) means that states must file a petition to terminate parental rights if a child has been in foster care for 15 out of the previous 22 months. And deported parents have zero chance to get back in the US in time, because illegal presence more than 6 months automatically triggers 3 year bar and illegal presence more than a year triggers 10 year bar to entry in the US.
