Rubio has an expression on his face of someone who lost his soul to Trump a long time ago.,fellowuscitizen,2025-05-03T14:33:59,14
He looks like a hostage. No doubt in my mind they have dirt on him.,Beforemath,2025-05-03T14:13:31,7
I think heâ€™s just a fall guy. He will be discarded like the one who looked the Keebler elf.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-03T14:13:12,6
He def looks like someone whoâ€™s soul is slowly leaving his body and he knows it and canâ€™t stop it,Grizkniz,2025-05-03T15:13:49,3
He should have pink eye with all that brown nosing he doesâ€¦,Namaslayy,2025-05-03T15:04:12,2
I guess he feels this will make him a presidential contender. King Mierdas has yet to touch Marco. It happens to everyone sooner or later.,janzeera,2025-05-03T14:35:03,2

Probably donâ€™t care since theyâ€™re Cuban and think theyâ€™re different (better) than the Venezuelans. Until Trump starts deporting more Cubans they wonâ€™t think itâ€™s a problem.,Shiplord13,2025-05-03T14:20:41,9
I can tell some of yall have never worked with Hispanic people lmfaoo. Try asking an El Salvadorian about Guatemalans or vice versa ðŸ˜‚,Enzhymez,2025-05-03T14:50:47,5
Cubans don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves.  Most of them got here on that bullshit preferential dry foot policy and now that their lives have improved they want to make sure the ladder is pulled up behind them.,InertiasCreep,2025-05-03T15:23:30,5
If Cuban Americans were following the news and not fully engrossed in the right wing propaganda machine they'd probably be upset.,Not_Bears,2025-05-03T14:27:27,5
