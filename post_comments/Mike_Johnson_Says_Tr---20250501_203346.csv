"If a ""traditional man"" somehow got pregnant, & decided to ""opt-out"" Almost nobody would be against him.  But when it's someone ""biologically made to receive pregnancy"", suddenly it's ok to ""force her to have to endure.""  I hope this helps even 1 person realize, just how unfair this is.",Succubus-Love,2025-05-01T20:38:08,36
Women's reproductive healthcare isn't just abortion. Just because a clinic services women's reproductive healthcare doesn't make it a bad place. I thought Trump touted about how abortion is left up to the states and that he wasn't going to push further on taking women's reproductive healthcare away from them.

"Yea, have kids in a world where nobody can find jobs and Gen Z and Gen Alpha are experiencing the worst economic situations since the 1920s. Great work. Certainly you won't curse and doom them to a life of gloom just so you can continue ""your bloodline"" and have ""the joys of parenthood"".  Grow up you selfish septic tanks. You are no more important than the kids who are getting bombed in other countries, who were killed in WW2, and other civilian deaths in war. Making a child suffer through this should be #1 reasoning for hell.",happyfundtimes,2025-05-01T21:27:16,6

"It's important at this time to remember a woman's right to choose is inseparable from life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  When we remove abortion, we don't merely remove freedom. We add real harm.  Forcing women and girls into childbirth is torture. Full. Stop.  Either we are a nation that believes individuals have the right to self-determination or we are not.
