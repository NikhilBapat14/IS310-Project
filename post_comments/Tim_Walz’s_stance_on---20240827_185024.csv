"> During his time in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019, Walz voted with Israel multiple times, including in 2017, to condemn a United Nations resolution that declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal.  > However, the congressman told Israelis on a 2009 diplomatic tour throughout the Middle East that he believed the increasing number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank was damaging prospects for brokering peace in the region, according to Business Insider.  > Following the attack carried out by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, Walz ordered state flags across Minnesota to be flown at half-mast to mourn the victims and criticized those who did not condemn the attack.  > “If you did not find moral clarity on Saturday morning, and you find yourself waiting to think about what you needed to say, you need to reevaluate where you’re at,” Walz told the packed sanctuary at the Beth El Synagogue in St. Louis Park, Minnesota on Oct. 10, just three days after the Hamas attack.  > In the weeks following the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Walz posted on social media, “The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas, and Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. We cannot let terrorists like Hamas win.”  > In early March, Walz called a permanent ""working ceasefire."" Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes, according to Gaza health authorities. His call came days after Harris also called for an “immediate” six-week ceasefire during a campaign stop in Alabama.  > In that same month, Walz sought to maintain a balanced perspective on the conflict, telling Minnesota Public Radio: “You can hold competing things: That Israel has the right to defend itself, and the atrocities of October 7 are unacceptable, but Palestinian civilians being caught in this… has got to end.”  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/07/tim-walz-views-israel-gaza/74685455007/  > Walz says the United States should provide more humanitarian aid to Palestinians and he has called for a two-state solution to the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   https://www.cfr.org/article/issue-guide-tim-walz-foreign-policy  Seems pretty close to Harris.  Supports Israel's right to exist and defend itself, but also supports Palestinian statehood, a ceasefire, and more aid for the Palestinian people; while remaining critical of Palestinian terrorism.  Pretty much bog standard position for every democratic President since Israel was formed.",houinator,2024-08-30T18:28:59,2
