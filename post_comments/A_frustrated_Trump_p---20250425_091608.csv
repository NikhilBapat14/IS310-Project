"No shit.  Only an imbecile would think that giving away a democratic country that is backed by NATO, the EU, and the majority of the Western countries to a dictator who has run his country own into the ground would be easy.",nwgdad,2025-04-25T09:24:50,5

"Imagine that. Ending a war is really hard to do. Really, imagine that.   Putin is not a friend. He wants to reunite the former USSR in its entirety and won’t stop until he does. Sure Zelenskyy would love for it to end, but he’s not about to give up any territory to do so. They’ll never meet eye to eye.   Only a simpleton would think it can be done in one phone call to both of them. Or even get them to sit at the same table to talk.",TwistedMemories,2025-04-25T11:35:27,1
