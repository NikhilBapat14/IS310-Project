"Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to know whether Amazon founder Jeff Bezos received any “promises or favors” from President Donald Trump in exchange for his “subservience” after dropping all plans to show customers the cost of tariffs. In a letter sent on Wednesday, Warren questions Bezos about the details of his conversation with Trump and raises concerns “about the potential for tariff-related corruption.”  On Tuesday, Trump called Bezos to complain after a Punchbowl News report said that Amazon planned on showing the cost of tariffs right next to a product’s total price. Amazon later issued a statement saying that displaying tariff prices “is not going to happen,” adding that the company only “considered” showing the fees on its Haul store, which ships products directly from China. Trump then told reporters that Bezos is “very nice” and “solved the problem very quickly,” as reported by The New York Times.  “If Amazon had followed through on any plans to provide transparency on tariff costs, it could have provided important information for consumers, allowing them to find out for themselves some of the true costs of President Trump’s broad and chaotic tariff policies,” Warren writes.

"Trump is waging a war of information.  He knows that a populace that is misinformed or uninformed won't act or oppose him because it won't know what is even going on.  So he opposes and denies all sources of correct information, even to the point of claiming things are happening that aren't happening (""China has come to the bargaining table.  Negotiations are happening."") and things are there that aren't there (Trump: ""The tattoos on his hand say MS13"" -- Reporter: ""No they don't.  That's Photoshop."" -- Trump: ""No, it's a tattoo.  He's a gang member.  That's why we deported him!"").  Likewise, Trump thinks that if people aren't reminded of the tariffs on Amazon they won't notice that they're there.    He realizes that if the economy gets really bad, even a lot of his steadfast supporters will abandon him.  ""It's the economy, stupid.""    The only way he can convince people that he has popular support is if at least the 30 percent of the voting population who voted for him are very vocal about it.  But if too many of them turn on him, it will be painfully clear to everyone that he has lost just about all support.",muffledvoice,2025-05-01T01:35:22,2

"It's difficult to navigate a big business in this volatile political climate.  Hard to stay under the wire where you wouldn't be receiving political backlash.  I would have liked to know how much the tariffs were going to add to the price of things, but I can see that Bezos would have risked alienating 1/3 of his customer base if he had gone through with the posting of tariff costs for his products.  I would think his company is going to take a heavy hit due to the tariffs since many of the products sold by Amazon come from China.  Just the other day, I was going to buy something online, saw the price offered by Amazon, saw where it was going to ship from (China), and I opted for buying directly through a U.S. vendor instead, as I didn't want to risk the product not getting shipped due to tariffs or supply chain issues.  I can't say that I blame Bezos for opting out of a politically charged situation.  These oligarchs should stay out of politics. Musk should have stayed out of it too.  Now he's damaged his companies and his reputation.  There is no winning for companies to take a political stance, as they risk alienating 1/3 of the population.

I'm NOT saying to go third party. That's a complete waste. The only way to fix the Democratic party is to starve the establishment DNC and support progressive candidates directly.

It's a joke that I made.  She didn't actually say it.  But if Trump say did something like this his sycophants would be jizzing their pants so save me that faux outrage.,bubbafatok,2025-04-30T17:15:26,20
We've already gone though one iteration of this. Amazon donated $1 to Trump's inauguration (whatever that means. Does anyone even know where that money goes?),chubs66,2025-04-30T16:36:04,2
This is all assuming Amazon didn't use this as a threat to get tarrif relief. My guess is they never intended to list tarrif fees separately. It's not hard to play regular 2D chess against this administration. ,TheSausagesIsRubbish,2025-04-30T22:02:40,1

That is the right way to do it. I am in a completely Red district in Texas and have no hope of progressive representation - so I contribute directly to the campaign of Dallas Representative Jasmine Crockett.,NineLivesMatter999,2025-05-01T08:46:14,2
"The real progressives, like Cortez, Sanders, and Walz, have been taking it to the streets, talking directly with the electorate, in simple language that plainly describes the criminality of the current Republican administration - whipping up popular fervor and building a base - just like Trump did.     They aren't doing a Schumer and writing Trump a 'serious letter', or sitting in his address holding stupid little signs (performative nonsense) - or doing like Biden, Pelosi, Harris and just hiding or only make appearances where they are paid to speak.      Progressives can't do anything in office because Republicans have a monopoly. But that doesn't mean they can't act - and some are. They can introduce articles of impeachment. They can filibuster bad legislation (instead of doing a Schumer and voting for it - the bastard) They can protest in public. They can hold opposition rallies. They can excoriate Trump and his co-conspirators on social media. They can make appearances on talk shows and plainly condemn the worst that the Trump administration is doing. They can campaign for next year's mid-terms.     But 90% of Democrats are flaccidly doing none of these things.",NineLivesMatter999,2025-05-01T08:39:34,1
