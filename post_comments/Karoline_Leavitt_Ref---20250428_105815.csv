"For those wondering how we got here it wasn't ""eggs are too expensive"" or even racism/misogyny (although that's a significant element) its their unaddressed mental health issues around self-victimization, fear-driven perspective, and lack of self-identity routed back to those first two categories. The personality traits of the folks cheering this on and supporting Trump are practically a psychological monolith. These people sincerely feel threatened ALL. THE. TIME. And their information sources (a la Newsmax, Fox News, etc.)continually reinforce that and give them new fears to concern themselves with and more outrage porn to fume at. There's ***always*** some problem occurring that they need to be in fear and/or angry about, some grave injustice to feel slighted by, some warped narrative to make their predominantly privileged selves to be a victim of. This started when Roger Ailes and Murdoch started Fox News and the news cycle moved to 24 hours, but now social media has perfected this with algorithms and AI-empowered engagement drivers.   These people are actively, enthusiastically cheering this on because of the above personality and perspective traits, they feel they are owed retribution for their victimhood, their fear, their anger. The curious thing about human psychology is we want to displace and project externally negative emotional spaces. Our brain literally is in pain when we experience fear/sadness/anger/rage. The brain wants to externalize this emotion/pain in a more tangible threat analysis way which is where negative attribution bias and projection come into the picture. Fox News and other capitalize on this by giving a specific cause agent target to place those emotions into. Once the target group of ""others""/cause agents are identified, they have a totem to attach these emotions and perspectives/prejudices to. They have their ""enemy"" who is deserving of retribution and revenge. This is what this all is, their ""punishment"" and our ""just desserts"" according to them, from their point-of-view, we have long deserved this punishment. We've been lambasted as ""Un-American"" that we're ""destroying this country"", that we're ""radicals/extremists"" which has all been powerfully tactical to trigger dehumanization of the ""other"" to permit state-coordinated and enacted violence on the ""other(s)"". They sincerely *cannot* see or fathom that their endorsement of this administration and these actions/threats also affect them too, they truly believe they are immune, above, outside of the effects and rule changes. They think they're part of a special class of citizens by being Republicans and ""MAGA"" (which explains the cult-like mindset and behavior) above everyone else. This group is a collection of mostly losers, fakes, and self-inflicted misery and misfortune that have no self-actualization, introspection, or mature ego to self-criticize with accountability. I know this first-hand as my own direct family, relatives, family friends for my whole life have fallen into this group, and I have spent the past almost 9 years studying them, conversing with them, getting inside their heads and perspectives. The above are the consistent hallmarks of these people and it is rooted in primal, core emotions of fear and anger.       This is existential for them, and has been slowly ramped up through media conditioning to reach this current zenith of public fervor. Racism and misogyny make this much easier to manipulate them and more prone to falling into this group, but it is not the primary driver. People become racist, they become misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic and so on. Those are prejudices developed from these core emotions and are environmentally driven. We come ""pre-installed"" with the capability of fear and anger as a means of survival, so again, this ties back to the fight-or-flight responses and existential threat outlook these people take on. It's not just that they hate gays, trans, black and immigrant peoples, they legitimately feel threatened by them and natural social progress. Humans are creatures of habit and familiarity. Our brains evolved primarily for pattern recognition for survival. It prioritizes threat analysis first and always. When you are immersed and conditioned into a state of perpetual anger and fear, it has many of the same neurological effects and structural changes associated with PTSD. If you have ever known someone with PTSD, one common thing is their strong attraction to routine and structure and a heightened emotional response and trigger to change. Humans in general are not super comfortable with change on the whole, but combined with their psychological peculiarities makes them even more averse to change to the point of it feeling like a threat to their survival. So if people are wondering how we got here, it's because we fed this beast and allowed the overfeeding to happen, these people are craven for relief and think catharsis and peace will come through brutal punishment and cruelty against those they hold to blame.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-04-28T16:16:39,2

"Well....if they do that it's going to backfire magnificently. Even the common layman would be able to start questioning the rationale here. Of course, the hardcore ""Trump is a God Emperor"" MAGA crowd will cheer on as the increasing tide of fascism unfolds here, but most Americans will be disgusted by this, to what degree that drives community and civic action is to be seen. That's a high profile arrest and one that's going to be next to impossible to gaslight into a fully legal/criminal arrest. **Sure they can do it,** ***but can they get away with it?***   I'd hazard to say this will be another major ""the Emperor has no clothes"" moment and one Americans will not swallow. The other question is, what's the upside of arresting the SCOTUS justices? They've had no issues flagrantly ignoring precedents, rulings, and even injunctions/lawsuits outcomes, so why arrest them? I understand intimidation, however; there's virtually no upside to doing so. Judges left would circle wagons and quickly find means to deputize an enforcement arm to initiate arrests of key Trump personnel. The military won't touch this with a 300 foot pole. The public will not accept such obvious dictatorial actions and would likely further galvanize the public against Trump et al. They can just continue ignoring the law (a la Constitutional Crisis) as they are doing now and so far they have been smooth sailing since. Until the Judiciary uses their teeth of deputized enforcement of their rulings against the Trump Administration, I don't foresee this becoming reality, because even as incompetent as the Trump 20 administration is, not *everyone* in that admin is *that* stupid.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-04-28T15:37:17,1

Or Steve, who worked in the warehouse, was arrested for resisting arrest, but even though the charges were dropped he was still fired.   Then add into the mix that it is super hard to get a job now and most people are spending 3-9 months on the job hunt.  That companies are posting ghost jobs just to get tax breaks, that companies are using AI to filter resumes before a human even sees them, that companies post jobs just to motivate people in those positions in their company to work harder so they are not replaced.  That companies are posting jobs they know they are going to give to intenal hires but just to maintain the illusion, they will still interview outside canidates.  Companies are turning to AI for any and every role they can use it to replace workers, saving a lot in wages.  Companies know they can offer super low wages because the job market is so tight right now. And that there are tens of thousands of former government employees looking for jobs right now too.  Then remember the hundreds of protests that happened during Trump's first time in office that did nothing to move the needle.

"> their marginalization complex  is based on the real decline in their outcomes as working class people.   One of the things we almost never discuss is that there‚Äôs a ceiling on what even privileged straight white men can achieve if they aren‚Äôt part of an elite nepotistic class, and many studies have argued that they‚Äôve experienced a decline in economic and social outcomes for themselves. The elites might also be straight white men but they don‚Äôt care about any of the working class. Everyone has a right to be angry over their lives getting worse.   We also have never tackled toxic masculinity as a social expectation so the only acceptable outlet to express themselves many find is the rage of right wing politics, which is all about dominating others to secure your owed position in a hierarchy. The elites pour billions into media and propaganda that reinforces this. Meanwhile programs like community college classes that teach men different trades have been cut since COVID and is responsible for most of the decline in male college enrollment since. We have a 60-40 female-male gap there.  If we can‚Äôt convincingly argue that social progress is not only not responsible for the decline of the working class, but a crucial part of the solutions for the working class, we‚Äôre to blame. That means not running from the right‚Äôs attacks on immigrants, trans people, or others. That also means realizing ‚Äúmen‚Äùis a group that needs to be addressed on their own terms, because working class men have unique social and economic issues and legitimate claims to oppression.

"1. The Headline is Highly Alarmist and Potentially Misleading 	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúKaroline Leavitt Refuses to Rule Out Arrest of Supreme Court Judges‚Äù 	‚Ä¢	This wording strongly suggests that the administration is actively considering arresting Supreme Court justices for political reasons, not for specific crimes. 	‚Ä¢	However, when you read the actual quotes, what Leavitt said is much more conditional and tethered to law enforcement norms: she emphasized that anyone ‚Äî including judges ‚Äî who obstructs federal law enforcement could face legal consequences. She did not threaten proactive political retaliation. 	‚Ä¢	Thus, the headline exaggerates and distorts. It creates a sensationalistic frame (almost a coup narrative) that is not fully borne out by the underlying quotes.  ‚∏ª  2. The Body of the Article Contains Real Concerns, but Blurs Distinctions 	‚Ä¢	Valid Concern: There is legitimate alarm at the idea of the executive branch becoming hostile to the judiciary, especially if arrests were selectively pursued against political opponents under vague ‚Äúobstruction‚Äù theories. 	‚Ä¢	Problem: The article fails to distinguish between a legitimate criminal charge (e.g., if a judge really obstructs law enforcement in a criminal matter) and mere political disagreement with judicial rulings. 	‚Ä¢	By not making this distinction, the piece blurs legal vs. political defiance ‚Äî which itself risks contributing to the erosion of norms the author seems to fear.  ‚∏ª  3. The Context Around Judge Dugan 	‚Ä¢	According to the article, the DOJ charged a Milwaukee judge for allegedly intentionally misdirecting federal agents. 	‚Ä¢	That is, on its face, a serious accusation involving specific behavior (obstruction of justice), not merely the judge‚Äôs rulings or ideological positions. 	‚Ä¢	However, the article implies this action is politically motivated, part of a broader assault on an independent judiciary ‚Äî a possible but not proven conclusion based solely on this one case. 	‚Ä¢	To be credible, the article would have needed to: 	‚Ä¢	Detail whether past administrations prosecuted judges for similar conduct. 	‚Ä¢	Prove selective prosecution based on political affiliation or ideology. 	‚Ä¢	Show DOJ communications or patterns confirming political targeting.  It does none of these things ‚Äî it relies on mood and pattern accusation without hard evidence.  ‚∏ª  4. Broader Concerns About Executive Overreach 	‚Ä¢	Even if the article‚Äôs specific claims are overstated, there is a very real risk (historically and philosophically) when the executive branch begins acting with open contempt toward the judiciary. 	‚Ä¢	Particularly if the executive implies that judges who oppose them could face arrest, it chills judicial independence. 	‚Ä¢	So while the specific framing here is alarmist, the underlying issue (executive vs judicial branch tension) is a legitimate one and deserves careful attention.  ‚∏ª  Summary Judgment: 	‚Ä¢	The New Republic article uses an inflammatory headline and exaggerates the immediate threat by over-interpreting Leavitt‚Äôs cautious, lawyerly answer. 	‚Ä¢	That said, the risk of genuine executive branch overreach toward the judiciary is real and deserves vigilance ‚Äî but it needs careful, non-sensational coverage to avoid feeding polarization even more. 	‚Ä¢	Better journalism would have treated this story with calm seriousness rather than panic.",TruthandMusicMatter,2025-04-28T14:44:33,0

I think Harris could have run as either a progressive or moderate if she had at least signaled some major obvious changes.   Instead she started talked about price gouging and tax credits less and less as time went on, instead changing her messaging to ‚ÄúTrump fascist and bad‚Äù. Tim Walz has even criticized this lack of focus on the cost of living since the election.    What you expect a good politician to be able to say is ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs legislative experience has stabilized the country after covid, and now I as a prosecutor will go after all the corruption in this country that‚Äôs stealing from your wallet. Price gouging, wage theft, monopolies, union busting, fraud‚Ä¶‚Äù Make a pivot that emphasizes how they both have different strengths, both better than Trump.
