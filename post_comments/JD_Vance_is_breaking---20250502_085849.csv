What is fear to a man who killed the Pope in the open?,ImmoKnight,2025-05-02T08:59:21,32
Donald's going to get angry about this after someone reminds him who JD Vance is.,30mil,2025-05-02T09:01:58,15
"Junior Dick Vance/Bowman/Hamel/whatever he changes his name to next doesn't have what it takes to handle diplomatic relationships. The indecisive buffoon can't even settle on a name lmao, who's going to take him seriously? Plus, he's far too insecure and knows he's the least intelligent person in the room every time he meets with foreign leaders.",LW_GLAZER,2025-05-02T09:11:06,7
He probably has a couch nearby he can land on.  Doubt this will affect him negatively in any way. Pope killer gonna keep on slaying.,DeltaFlyer0525,2025-05-02T09:30:36,4
"Disingenuous title. He just gave a more realistic version of events ""The war in Ukraine is not going to end any time soon"", While Trump keeps saying ""We are going to make a peace deal in the next day or two"".",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T09:39:42,4
"No worries, he'll land on a couch.",Cheetotiki,2025-05-02T09:16:56,2
I’m ok with Vance falling on his face. This is undoubtedly a bipartisan feeling.,NetStrange3395,2025-05-02T09:47:29,2
"Maybe the snake went through a calculus that the mineral deal was a major checkbox for Trump, and that a slight break from the other checkbox - IE the fellating of Putin - was going to be accepted in the end.   Or, it's a headfake.",steve_ample,2025-05-02T09:05:48,2

Man's a member of the god damned Mythic Dawn.,CrashB111,2025-05-02T09:22:23,9
"Never heard him, low level covfefe boy",hey-coffee-eyes,2025-05-02T09:43:57,3
"J.D Vance lack executive functioning skills, he'll (hopefully) never be president.  I'm not even just saying that, because, I can't stand him, I legitimately don't think he would be able to handle presidency as he would do one of two things, he would either abuse his power like the child he is or would be so overwhelmed, he wouldn't know what to do, also like the child he is and he's just as likely to go either route.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-02T15:19:44,3
I’ve heard he’s bi-sectional.,i_love_pencils,2025-05-02T10:05:23,3
