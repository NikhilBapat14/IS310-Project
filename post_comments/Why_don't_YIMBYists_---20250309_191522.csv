"Liberals agree with the vast majority of the democratic platform, and critiques on the party’s housing strategy doesn’t somehow make them more similar to the republicans. Liberals disagree with republicans on nearly every single issue, thinking that the housing policy in Texas is good doesn’t somehow make them agree with republicans on everything.",sunshine_is_hot,2025-03-09T20:08:52,51
"After living in socal for 10 years I’ve definitely become YIMBY myself. First off I would say that I encounter very little YIMBYs who are socially conservative and I’m certainly not, so I’m not sure where you get that idea from. Second as someone who previously lived in a red state for many years, I’ve experienced first hand republicans tend to absolutely hate non-housing related YIMBY agenda items such as building transit, which I think is really important. While socal has huge problems with getting much needed housing built, it is the best region of the US for public transit expansion currently.",tayste5001,2025-03-09T20:07:51,27
"I can answer this because I’m securely in the abundance agenda camp.  I believe in active government involvement, including targeted spending and regulatory carve-outs for specific industries like clean energy and housing.  But that government involvement needs to work - if we pass EV chargers as an initiative they need to be in operation two years later.  The GOP would never pass anything like that in the first place.  I think that is what you are missing in the criticism of California vs Texas.  Texas is effectively building homes, California can’t build affordable homes - much less significant infrastructure projects.  Ezra’s big take away is California has spent billions on high speed rail and delivered nothing.  So what I want is effective government that can deliver results.  Not just big government.  Progressive voices seem happy with big ineffective government - as exemplified by California and New York.  But I also don’t want to burn it all down.",siberianmi,2025-03-09T20:13:23,27
If you’re framing Ezra Klein as a crypto Republican… your perspective might be a bit biased,ttown2011,2025-03-10T05:30:12,20
"Is calling Trump a ""two-bit Mao"" really just ""minor policy wonkery"" to you?    I can't speak as much to Noah Smith, but Klein fundamentally disagrees with most of the Republican party. If you have the opinion that he's more Republican than Democrat, then I'm kinda doubting that you've read much of his work at all. I doubt that he would even say that it is the Texas State GOP that is responsible for the cheap housing there, instead talking more about the local YIMBY organizations and city leadership.

"I think you're missing Ezra's point, and while I don't always agree with, I think he does have a point.  Comparing housing in Houston and Los Angeles is fair. If a complete lack of zoning restrictions leads to cheap abundant housing, and the other extreme leads to a shortage, there's probably a middle ground that hits the best of both worlds.  Advocating that position doesn't make someone a Republican.",kinkgirlwriter,2025-03-10T20:55:13,12

"Because Progressive assholes don't own the Democratic Party and have only dominated discourse in it for like the last 10 years. There is a reason that despite 2020 being the height of progressive influence, Biden still won the primary by a lot. They are an assortment of a very loud minority in the party that party leadership got scared of in 2018 and stopped standing up to.   Most of the well-known ""Abundance Agenda"" types are former members of the Obama and Clinton administrations. It's basically full of people who actually give a shit about good government policy and not devotion to ideological dogma.   The republican party isn't interested in good government. To them, the only good government is an ineffective one. Progressives seem to only care if the government meets their ever expanding moral dogma.

"In this case, I think the best way to answer this question is to think about political viewpoints as falling along two axes: the first being left/right axis the second being authoritarian/libertarian axis. NIMBYS typically fall on the left side of the left/right spectrum yet move toward the libertarian position on the libertarian/authoritarian axis. Meanwhile many Republicans, and I’m thinking specifically here of Trump Republicans, fall on the right side of the left/right axis and have at least moved toward the authoritarian side of the authoritarian/libertarian axis.",Eyebeamjelly,2025-03-14T02:20:28,1

At least the Progressives recognize the modern GOP for being what it is rather in tandem with their complaints about Democrats.  The thing that frustrates me as well is that why are we so insistent that the Democratic Party of today is somehow uniquely evil and incompetent while treating the Democrats that lost in 1968, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 2000 as this dignified good party while acting like suddenly they're evil?",wiz28ultra,2025-03-12T22:49:51,-2

"Houston does not divide the city into specific zones for residential, commercial, or industrial use. This allows a mix of developments, such as high-rise apartments near single-family homes.

This flexibility attracts developers and fosters economic growth by enabling diverse land uses in close proximity.

"You cant rewrite history and I have no idea what right wing media is pushing out.    You want to whitewash the past and bleach your mind of anything approaching rational thats fine, others are not.  Progressives used to disenfranchise blacks in the south to advance the issue of womans suffrage.  Supporting prohibition because it helped advance their issues and candidates at the ballot box.  The movement started out advancing their causes through punishing other demographics.  You still see it today in the policy with the promoting of cost of living increases on low income residents in an attempt to force an increase in use of public transit.  Pushing the burden of revenue generation of cities onto residential property causing widespread gentrification to advance spending on homeless, affordable housing, etc.  Reducing penalties for criminal offenses which drives up property crime that again adversely affects lower income residents.  Progressives support increased and additional fees and fines as a means to correct social behavior, sharp increased fees and fines instead of low general tax increases to fund services and programs.  There is always the necessity to draw blood, to make someone hurt.  It can be something incredibly fucking mundane but Progressives generally are not for it unless it inflicts pain or penalty on someone.  Climate Change is a good example of this.  Their focus is entirely on the individual, the absolute smallest source of emission generation.  Where the most pragmatic and logical policy would follow targeting corporations the largest sources of emissions.  So instead of banning natural gas in residential housing which is only responsible for around 4% of national emissions, from 66 million households.  And would place an enormous fiscal burden on the public.  They could focus their attention on shutting down the 210 coal fired plants that contributes significantly more to national emissions and actually have a chance of reducing national emissions in someones lifetime.  there are around 1.5 billion personal vehicles globally and they only contribute 5-7% to global emissions.  EVs are not doing shit to reduce emissions.  Yet this is what Progressives focus on, they want to penalize people who drive combustion engine vehicles, make it more expensive to live so EVs can be subsidized.    If you wanted to target transportation emissions and have any kind of an impact you would target the largest source of emissions coming from the smallest group which would be medium to heavy duty trucks, thats commercial shipping.  Trucks used in construction and industrial mining, shipping vessels, trains, airplanes, etc.  But that isnt what Progressives do, they target the individual and make them suffer, they increase their cost of living.
