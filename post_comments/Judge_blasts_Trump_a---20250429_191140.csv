"If anybody doesn't know, especially those of you poking fun at the phrasing:   Those specific words ""arbitrary and capricious"" carry legal ramifications, as they are the specific legal language used to describe actions that are not allowed in this context.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-29T19:45:26,6

"A speeding ticket?    A speeding ticket?  Well, why didn't you say so? That's a very serious crime. We can't allow foreigners with speeding tickets into our country because it might corrupt our youth.   Next thing you know they'll be jaywalking. And then they'll be lying about their age on dating apps.   Now if only they were a rapist, that would be a whole different story. Then we could make them President.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T19:22:00,3

"If this ""invasion"" of millions of illegal immigrants warrants a national emergency granting the president powers to suspend constitutional rights, *why is it so damn hard for them to find illegal immigrants?*  They grab people from court houses, from Green card interviews,  and cancel student visas to make the students ""illegal"".  Aren't there millions and millions of invaders? Why are they so hard to find?",AlmaInTheWilderness,2025-04-29T23:43:45,2
