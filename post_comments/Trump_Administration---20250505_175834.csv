Just because a judge rules against Trump doesn't have any effect. So what make sure that they will die in court?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T21:10:03,2
American courts and judges are jokes with zero power over the leading elites so I canâ€™t see it changing anything. The court will rule against the government and they will simply ignore them. What is a judge going to be able to do? Say stop or Iâ€™ll say stop again. Most American law enforcement agencies that the courts rely on for enforcement are cowards that just want pay cheques and are happy to see the constitution ripped up - they definitely wonâ€™t listen to a judge.,Suitable-Ratio,2025-05-05T22:16:41,1
