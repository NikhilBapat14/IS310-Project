It smacks of chasing the limelight over doing the dirty work and playing well with the teammates. Anyone who has served on a board or committees and sub committees knows that this is an inefficient and frustrating dynamic to have to work around.  Right now a lot of green energy projects in red districts are being stopped or reassessed because of federal funding and staff cuts. Republicans control the house and the committees. This is a perfect time to reach over to reps in the districts affected and work with them to try to push back and restore the stability and funds necessary for building up our better infrastructure like she envisioned. Republican donors and companies are losing money because of Trumps chaos and anything that motivates them to help us face the climate crisis is worth tapping into.

That's not to say there aren't good California Democrats, it's just that when Republicans say ""Oh, you just want us to be California"" I can firmly say ""Absolutely fucking not"" because despite being technically aligned on a federal level, the politics and needs of where I live are very different from what California has and I see adopting their ideas wholesale to be as dumb or even dumber than trying to adopt Alabama politics under a Republican here. Neither fit, I don't want either.  That said, if I ever got my hypothetical utopia, I'd want the Democrats to split. I'd want Greens or Socialists or a renewed Wisconsin Progressive Party to contest elections. I see shades of California in my time in Dane County, where there wasn't enough competition and someone I disagreed with got in purely by winning the Democratic primary out of institutional inertia and establishment support, because nobody in the Republicans in the general was going to win in Madison of all places.  Screw national multi-party politics, I want 50 states that all have their own multi-party politics and have to somehow get them to work together on a federal level but could change based on political headwinds.

"I disagree that they do not appeal to people nationally. You do you. I have higher standards than ""just not the other guy'. It was the main platform of the party for years, which put them in a perfect spot to do or not do a thing for us, because we could have it worse, according to them.   IMO: Voters like you stop bold policy. You have let the party determine your standards instead of the other way around. Progressive policies help most people most of the time. When you start a term with concentrated bucket of ideal policies, they will never make it to the books in that state. They will always get diluted. So we get less than ideal, right?  But when you start with a bucket of already diluted policies, once those go through the process and negotiations, etc, we have hardly a thing. Where we start matters. Just as much as money in politics does. The people will never be able to compete with corporate dollars and win.  Lastly, if you're okay with the genocide our gov is assisting in, IMO you aren't anti-war. You aren't anti-occupation. You're either supporting it or not. There is no room for gray, especially for the innocent victims. They aren't just kinda being slaughtered. They aren't kinda dead. This last issue here is where the party lost the most voters, imo. Not only did the party pretend no one even cares, it flippantly brushed them off within minutes of the presidential debates starting. Like ""Yeah, yeah, Gaza Blaza, blah, blah, blah"". Basically a ""fuck you, we don't give a shit what you think"".   Here's the position I take when voting, whether the small things like referendums locally to the POTUS elections. I approach the policies or lack of policy from the perspective of the most vulnerable in our country. The poor, the disabled, the sick, children, the elderly, for example. If I only gauged policies in how they help me, a massive segment of society loses, even dies. It is my personal experience that the more financially comfortable a Democrat is, the more centrist they vote. I think this is selfish. I think this is contrary to what we say we stand for and what our mission is for the country. It goes against my personal standards. I think I have a responsibility to society to go for the best possible policies and negotiate from there. If we start in the middle, the process pushes it all to the Right even more, resulting in policies that look a lot like GOP, except with glitter and fun slogans, or hats. Branding. But what about those vulnerable people I mentioned? Do they count? Are we of the belief they shouldn't count. Should we only consider our quality of life and ignore the senseless killing of people elsewhere? Do we condone funding further violence and death? Who benefits? You? How? I do not benefit. And this is where those unhappy with the party are coming from. Money going to Israel needs to be kept at home where there is plenty of human suffering to address. This WILL help society. Our society. If I vote for policies that contradict this, we lose. All of us. I am not alone in this stance either.   As for the accusation that those crowds are running on warm fuzzies, that makes you a perfect voter in the eyes of the DNC. You keep them comfortable.  Thinking we're just a bunch of silly hippies who can't comprehend the role of classism, or as one Dem said about us this week, we don't know big words like ""oligarchy"". If the party wants unity, they can find us at the fuzzy rally but not checking the box next to a Centrist's name. These rallies started AFTER the chaos started. The party said little to nothing for weeks. Those motivations you equate with just fuzzies are real. People have started to take a step back and see things for what they are. You can't deny there has been a shift in public sentiment towards they party. Continue to pretend this is not the case and we'll be back here having the same conversation in 4 years.

Money going to Israel needs to be kept at home where there is plenty of human suffering to address. This WILL help society. Our society. If I vote for policies that contradict this, we lose.

"The nation is indeed quite right wing and it sort of peaked in the 80s when Republicans won the White House for like three elections in a row. Clinton’s Third Way was a strategy designed to defeat that by triangulating on Republican positions and siphoning away their voters.   The problem is that they doubled down on this strategy over and over well beyond when it was shown to be ineffective at getting policy through. By moving the party to the center right and keeping it there, they neutered any chance for the electorate to swing back to the left when they decided Republicans weren’t delivering for them. Political orientation in a country with two political parties is a pendulum, and this ensured it would never swing back to the left, only between a center right party and an increasingly weird far right party.   I don’t care to get into the very tired Bernie vs Clinton debate but it’s clear that we backed a loser come the general election, and the DNC has a clear habit of favoritism via seniority that lead some to question the legitimacy of the selection or the power behind the scenes that may have influenced it. Bernie is also drawing record crowds while people generally groan when Clinton gives a public statement these days.   To make a long story short, people may be sick of right wing politics, but people are *definitely* sick of center right Democrats.

Now that dems aren’t in a position to legislate she wants to take on a more explicitly oversight committee that she had less seniority working on.   This jumping from position to position without getting in deep to what a committee needs both in minority and majority roles is why the party didn’t support her over him before. It smacks of chasing the limelight over doing the dirty work and playing well with the teammates. Anyone who has served on a board or committees and sub committees knows that this is an inefficient and frustrating dynamic to have to work around.   Also there’s so many committees and subcommittees with so much work even in minority that they can’t just pick everything that interests them and serve on all the top spots. Realistically even the hardest working members with the best and most staff have a limit to how much they can honestly take on at once. Maybe he wasn’t best for the role but he was more experienced and had the backing of his peers and not just some Pelosi conspiracy.   Right now a lot of green energy projects in red districts are being stopped or reassessed because of federal funding and staff cuts. Republicans control the house and the committees. This is a perfect time to reach over to reps in the districts affected and work with them to try to push back and restore the stability and funds necessary for building up better infrastructure like she envisioned.
