If politicians just spent 10% of their time trying to make things better for people just think what they could accomplish. How do you get so craven?,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-04T10:37:17,159
"Hey remember when Kemp was in charge of elections when there were some shady data wipes in Ossoff's House election he lost?  And now he's popular enough for being a contrast to Trump that he'd get this seat in a landslide.  We have seen at least one guy like this (Chris Sununu) basically say ""fuck off I don't want any of the Senate bullshit"" and if that wasn't crossing his mind then there's no reason he isn't running already.",OrnamentJones,2025-05-04T11:25:43,44
Kemp is worried that he can’t win. A lot of job and funding cuts in GA.,Flimsy-Rooster-3467,2025-05-04T10:59:53,39
This headline is confusing. I think they are saying Republicans want Democrats to run on impeachment because it will fire up the base. Guess they don't want MTG to run because they think we won't win statewide.,ammie8,2025-05-04T12:29:25,12
I’d rather the GOP get absolutely and incomprehensibly wiped in the midterms but that’s just me.,Throb_Zomby,2025-05-04T14:36:45,12
Gonna laugh my ass of if Kemp pulls a Sununu and turns it down because he's not interested in the bullshit of being in the Senate sucking Trump's dick. Extra points if he endorses Ossoff.  e: CALLED IT,alabasterskim,2025-05-04T10:40:15,28
GOP doesn’t know how to do the right thing. Their constituents need to feel some real pain before they’ll come around.      Democrats need to be more welcoming to center right voters by shutting the fuck up about gun control and working together. Stop letting right wing media say you want to take people’s very expensive toys away.      Leave each other the fuck alone and help people. This stalemate shit is not working for Americans.,WalrusSwarm,2025-05-04T19:34:05,6
"Removing Trump won’t do anything. If anything it will enrage his base and ramp up movements under Vance who is a true believer in this fascist project.  You will have to remove the entire top 50-100 of his administration, and go after everyone from ICE, the heritage foundation to Elon, to Theal, and the proud boys and a long list of collaborators, and try them for treason.  Until the gauntlet is brought down on every single collaborator, this will not end.",SookHe,2025-05-04T12:14:34,11

“Baseless”  So Johnson just confirmed what has been abundantly obvious:  The official Republican Party policy is that disregarding the Supreme Court (and thus the Constitution) is a baseless offense.,jgilla2012,2025-05-05T02:19:45,2
GOP ain’t impeaching him. Dems proved they don’t give a shit for 4 years letting him go free. Stop with the bullshit. Should just run stories on picking out America’s swastika variant,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T18:39:08,4

if he has his eye on 2028 running for Senate in 2026 is stupid in two ways  running for a job to barely stay in it a year before starting a presidential campaign   he runs a decent risk of losing and ending his 2028 ambitions before they get started   the environment for Republicans in 2026 is going to be the worst since 2006,hyphnos13,2025-05-04T14:52:01,15
Ossoff did a town hall last week where someone asked him about impeachment and what he was doing about it. I don't remember his exact answer but it was along the lines of he supports that but dems aren't in the position where it's possible right now.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-04T13:43:19,9
Endorse Ossoff???    Thanks for the chuckle of the day.,oldguydrinkingbeer,2025-05-04T10:48:07,24
"Kemp would never endorse Ossoff   Granted there's no guarantees he runs, but republicans would have to be pretty dumb not to run Kemp for Senate",blues111,2025-05-04T10:59:36,12

"Vance isn’t charismatic enough. I honestly think less damage will be done because Vance can’t pull all the bs Donald does and get away with it. Trump is only ruler, with no pushback from most republicans elected because he is likable(somehow) by most of their followers. He united the republican cult. Vance doesn’t have that power.  I also think we need to make sure no one forgets who is letting all this happen. Trump might be pulling the trigger but those elected in congress are loading the rounds and those in his cabinet are pointing the gun.",AcidRohnin,2025-05-04T18:55:59,6

"How exactly would the dems have been able to do anything more than they did? Serious question from a foreigner. From over here, Trump stacked the courts who then said he was basically a god as long as he's sitting on the throne there and they couldn't jail him despite impeaching him more than enough times. With the judiciary all leaning right, and control of everywhere else, how could the dema have done more? (Please don't cancel me. I really want to know!)",anfornum,2025-05-04T19:12:19,1
Wouldn't being a senator give him a platform to get on the news more than an ex senator?,MouseWithBanjo,2025-05-04T15:53:46,3

They had 4 years to put his traitorous ass in prison and Garland decided he would rather fuck off and let it ride.   It’s cool though I’m practicing my goose stepping,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T19:29:46,3
