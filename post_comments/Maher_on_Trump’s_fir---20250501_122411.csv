"Wasn't Bill Maher gobbling Trump's knob just recently? Isn't he a sort of ""softener"" or ""apologist"" at this point?   Also thanks Captain Obvious. Pick a lane.",outinthecountry66,2025-05-01T12:26:44,24
That's true. Another true statement is that Bill Maher sucks ass.,Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-05-01T12:26:18,11
"They may be from different species, but Mahr and Trump are still two shits in the same bowl. He doesn't deserve attention.",kittenpantzen,2025-05-01T12:26:12,14
Please ignore this dickhead into eternal irrelevance.,vtosnaks,2025-05-01T12:38:49,6
"2 weeks ago, Maher went to dinner because he wanted to see ""if this could be something more than 2 men hurling insults at each other.""",Bob_Van_Goff,2025-05-01T12:26:58,3
He must have been disinvited to the Mar-a-Lago Memorial Day Hog Roast,heismanwinner82,2025-05-01T12:37:02,3
maher still has a platform? I am so looking forward to him and Dennis Miller flying a kite somewhere around Chernobyl or Fukushima,Vimes-NW,2025-05-01T12:50:34,3
What? The roofie finally wore off?,biscuitarse,2025-05-01T14:59:54,2
Time for HBO to let Bill go so he can take his show to NewsMax where it belongs,gorillasuitriot,2025-05-01T12:28:34,2
Kind of like all the shows Bill has hosted.,YouCactusBastard,2025-05-01T12:35:07,1
Maher went right got a fright and is trying to course correct. ,DeadlyFern,2025-05-01T12:41:30,1
The hate Bill is getting from democrats is why as a democrat I am so tired of many of you.,Be-skeptical,2025-05-01T12:44:22,-1
"While I agree he's an absolute prick, Maher basically said Trump didn't come off totally insane when he met him, which could have been simply an honest observation from one dinner and not necessarily an endorsement of him.",bravetailor,2025-05-01T13:03:27,4
"That's not happening, Trump refused to be roasted again.",Vimes-NW,2025-05-01T12:51:30,2
"I remember loathing HBO for giving shows to Dennis Miller, Garry Shandling, and this d!ckcheese. Still do, but I loathed them before as well.",Vimes-NW,2025-05-01T12:53:49,3
Clearly you have never watched Bill Maher and/or Newsmax if you believe that for even a second ,Be-skeptical,2025-05-01T12:37:25,0
"Is Maher worth defending? I’m not that out of line with him politically, but he hasn’t been funny in a long, long time(which is his primary purpose as a comedian.)",Chickabeeinthewind,2025-05-01T14:08:57,2
Same. This whole sub is getting ridiculous,PlatinumKanikas,2025-05-01T13:01:49,-1
"nah, it was way more than that. He praised him after having dinner with him, bitched about Larry David's opinion piece where he compared Trump to Hitler, and generally having a soft approach to the far right...",outinthecountry66,2025-05-01T13:12:57,4
He was being skeptical. /u/ does not check out.,Vimes-NW,2025-05-01T12:52:27,3
He’s notably getting more irritable and can be very off putting sometimes. His arrogance is off the charts. But this idea that he’s turned right or even maga is absurd.  The dems needs to quit these purity tests and no true Scotsman competitions.,Cookenbauer,2025-05-01T16:37:47,2
"Yeah, but that's still consistent with Maher's general hypocrisy for years now. He's always soft peddled the far right while simultaneously saying Trump is a terrible president.",bravetailor,2025-05-01T13:17:01,2
My thoughts as well,Be-skeptical,2025-05-02T07:14:16,1
"yeah, hence 'pick a lane'. its like he's hedging his bets at all times. like just stand up for something!",outinthecountry66,2025-05-01T17:56:13,2
