his moves have not been subtle,RepulsiveLoquat418,2025-05-08T17:22:58,17
"Honestly, Newsom seems like he would make a better media mogul than a politician. He does have good business instincts, a flare for generating attention, and good understanding of how to infowar. His personality just may be a bit too slick for politics.   If I were him, I would skip trying for President and instead use my millions to try to build a liberal media outlet.",gradientz,2025-05-08T17:34:27,6
"Now that he doesn't need my vote for guv, he really quickly pivoted to being a piece of shit.",StormbreakerHC,2025-05-08T17:30:12,3
OP go back to your conservative meme sub and complain more about them democrats.  Then keep posting your Christian outrage garage   Anyone like you that post shit like water isn’t a human right then tries to go after Gavin and California are vile trolls    Downvote this loser and his post  Edit: following someone’s account OP and downvoting all their post is such loser behavior,CheesyPotatoSack,2025-05-08T17:30:09,12
"As a California Democrat, I'd say that's clear.  Give us  Kamala Harris for governor, if not for president!",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T17:20:42,5
He is not likable enough to be elected. It doesn't matter what he does. He's not going to make it. Somebody should tell him now.,30mil,2025-05-09T04:28:49,1
I just saw a poll with 230 thousand people voting that said 71 percent of people think trumps idea to re open Alcatraz is perfectly fine.  Americans have crossed critical mass in their stupidity. A majority of voters will soon tell us that getting hit in the face with a pool cue cures acne if their news says so,PayTheTeller,2025-05-08T18:05:52,0
"As a Californian, I give Newsom points for doing what he said he would do: reduce the gap between rich and poor. Many of his policies have done just that through certain tax breaks and social programs whether people realize it or not. Mega points to him for batting away the NIMBYs preventing more housing to be built. Super mega points to him for continuing to fund free breakfast and lunch for K-12 despite a budget deficit. I do wish he would hold some folks accountable for this rail project though... I don't care what Newsom does after he terms out in 2026 as long as it involves continuing to make MAGAs lose their shit and give him free airtime in their minds.",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-05-09T03:01:38,-1
Supposedly Newsom has been toasted as the future president at his private birthday parties.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T17:27:10,4
"Also, great hair.  I'd really like to know what hair products Newsom uses and how often he blow dries his hair.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T19:40:31,1
Oh my god lol I’m actually dying.  > Downvote this loser!  *5 minutes later*  > How dare you downvote me! Only a loser does that!,NoLet6074,2025-05-09T11:04:54,2

"They can't ever have seen even a picture of Alcatraz.  But I'd pay taxes to remodel it for the right group of prisoners, starting with Trump and Musk.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T19:41:04,1

No I said only a loser goes and downvotes every single comment a person makes on their account not just one post.,CheesyPotatoSack,2025-05-09T13:55:38,0
I see you logged into your alt account again to post. Wow this is really HUGE loser behavior  Edit: also stalking Taylor swift subs and talking about the libs. Honestly get a life,CheesyPotatoSack,2025-05-09T13:58:03,0
I see your posting from your alt account. That emanates ignorance,CheesyPotatoSack,2025-05-09T13:57:09,0
Yes that's exactly what they are. Nancy Pelosi will help push him as the party nominee. I live in Ca and even if he could somehow still run for gov I likely wouldn't bother to vote for him again. If you want low turnout this is the guy to run.,crucialcolin,2025-05-08T17:39:27,6
"I don’t got an alt, but I do have a good friend who I  can get to help me make a point  Good guess though, most people just call one of us a bot",AlvaroSoler1991,2025-05-09T14:02:20,-1
I'd be more interested if Newsom hadn't started pandering to the right.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T17:52:21,8
"I dont know wtf the Dems fascination is with 'on the fence' Republicans.  Kamala running around with Liz Cheney and subequently losing should have been the death of the courting the right thing, but here we are.  Dude will pivot right and gain jack shit from it.",InertiasCreep,2025-05-08T23:34:59,4
>I dont know wtf the Dems fascination is with 'on the fence' Republicans.   Because theyre both right-wing parties. Democrats would rather lose trying to court the ultra-far-right - who is still politically more closely aligned with them - than acknowledge anything left of Manchin.,Gary_The_Strangler,2025-05-09T06:38:03,3
Liz Cheney is one of the few Republicans left with any ethics of any kind.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-09T00:04:07,1
Liz Cheney having ethics and Kamala losing partially because she tried courting GOP voters with Liz Cheney are not mutually exclusive statements.,InertiasCreep,2025-05-09T01:18:05,3
