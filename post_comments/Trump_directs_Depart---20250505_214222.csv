Tina Peters needs to rot in prison for the full length of her sentence. It's a good thing she was convicted on state charges.,No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-05T21:54:50,65
"If you haven't seen her sentencing, it's one of the most stern rebukes of the 2020 attempt to tip the election to Trump:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uXqkOM5Vbbw",nerphurp,2025-05-05T22:05:01,63
"“Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment,” he wrote.  In the post, Trump directed the U.S. Department of Justice to “take all necessary action to help secure the release of former Mesa county clerk Tina Peters,” referring to her as a hostage that was “being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons.”      We literally have her on video giving some unauthorized people access to a secure building to access voting machines. I’m so sick of this political prosecution gas lighting.",Demonking3343,2025-05-06T01:05:41,34

"Goes to show the importance (especially with this administration) of focusing on state prosecution. Otherwise no matter what you do, trump will pardon you if you end up kissing his ass.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-05T22:24:21,20

"Man, remember when Donald Trump tried to overturn a fair and legal election?",Elegant_Plate6640,2025-05-05T22:59:14,8
"1) Why is the President using a social media post to give direction to a Cabinet Department  2) Presidents are not supposed to intervene in individual cases, though this is something that Trump has consistently flouted to almost no pushback.  3) The case in question is of a person convicted  by a jury under state law in a state trial and the federal government has no jurisdiction. Normally, Republicans would be furious with this attempt to interfere with a state's rights.",econoquist,2025-05-06T01:23:05,8
Presumably this will be the case where Trump and his fascists make their attempt to overpower a state and get his stacked supreme court to help him cement doing so as a presidential power.,Prior-Tea-3468,2025-05-05T23:16:06,7

Trump’s friendship and freeing of criminals into the streets is vastly under reported and should be a more prominent narrative,MiniBanjo,2025-05-06T03:38:18,5
"Governor Polis *could* pardon her, in theory. He’s a Democrat, and gay, so Trump hates him. And vice-versa, I’m sure.",ExtonGuy,2025-05-06T05:09:52,2
"Trump claims that Tina Peters is a ""political prisoner"". Here's what Ayn Rand had to say about ""political"" crimes:   ""There can be no such thing as a political crime under the American system of law. Since an individual has the right to hold and to propagate any ideas he chooses (obviously including political ideas), the government may not infringe his right; it may neither penalize nor reward him for his ideas; it may not take any judicial cognizance whatever of his ideology.  By the same principle, the government may not give special leniency to the perpetrator of a crime, on the grounds of the nature of his ideas.""

"Honestly, I’m rock hard after watching this video. True justice porn",interleukin710,2025-05-06T00:27:42,13
"I watched the whole trial, and it was such a clear-cut case of Tina being a bad actor both during the crimes, and also during the trial. That's why Tina said she was fucked as soon as the video from Ron Watkins (yes, Q) went online that showed his data came from her office and machines. She was caught sending her friend, Sherronna Bishop, to her office in the middle of the night to pick up the equipment. They also showed that another Colorado clerk made an image of the Dominion machines, which is what Tina claims is all she did. The other clerk was never charged because he didn't do all the other things Tina did, particularly the crime stuff like stealing equipment, and sharing the images and equipment with her band of weirdos. She also told Mike Lindell's lawyer that Mike and him had full use of her office, giving them full control to run their conspiracy.  Her lawyers were trying every shady trick they could, they tried to infer that the Colorado prosecutors had given Sherronna Bishop immunity to federal prosecution by letting her testify, which was not what they did and they can't even offer. To be fair her legal team was pretty new, she fired her old lawyers a few months before the trial, because her first legal team was trying to temper her insanity. So she hired Lindell's pick of lawyers, who just encouraged her bad-faith defense.",marry_me_sarah_palin,2025-05-06T07:09:36,9

You’d think the law and order party would be furious he’s freed cop killers and pedophiles but they’re happy as clams,MiniBanjo,2025-05-06T03:39:42,3
"Only the first question matters here, and the answer is that trumps politics have always been a mix of theatre and policy. He wants her released (in the sense it’s desirable, not that he cares about her in particular), but he also wants the spectacle of demanding it. The spectacle is honestly like 3/4ths of the point. It gives something for his supporters to rally around, and something new for the media to report on as “breaking news” in the never ending media cycle.",Ja3k_Frost,2025-05-06T04:11:33,1
