I don't think there's any state which so consistently votes for progressive measures, and then elects politicians who want to do the exact opposite.   **Abortion Rights**  In 2024, Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment to protect abortion.  * When the amendment went on the ballot, Republicans tried to [scuttle it by using confusing ballot language which the courts blocked](https://www.firstalert4.com/2024/09/05/missouri-judge-rules-that-abortion-rights-amendment-language-november-ballot-is-misleading/). * Missouri Republicans are busy trying to undermine this by [putting it back on the ballot, agian with misleading language](https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-senate-vote-proposed-abortion-ban-constitutional-amendment/). * Since Missouri Republicans have gotten slapped down for using misleading ballot language in the past (see below), Republicans are [now trying to prevent courts from being able to stop them](https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-04-15/missouri-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-court-involvement-with-ballot-language).  **Minimum Wage**  Also in 2024, Missouri voters passed an increase in the minimum wage, tie-minimum wage to inflation, and mandate sick-leave and family-leave for certain workers.  * Republicans have been [busy trying to figure out how to undermine or repeal this](https://missouriindependent.com/2025/02/05/missouri-republicans-consider-delaying-voter-approved-minimum-wage-hike-paid-sick-leave/).  **CLEAN Act**  Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment that included ethics reform (limiting lobbyist gifts, lengthened the amount of time between leaving the legislature and becoming a lobbyist, expanded sunshine law to all state legislators) and would prevent gerrymandering (using a non-partisan commission to create maps that ensured partisan fairness and competitiveness, contiguousness, compactness, and followed clearly established city or county boundaries instead of chopping them up). This was approved by over 62% of the voters.  * Republicans first [tried to gut the rules](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/voters-in-missouri-approved-ethics-reform-republican-lawmakers-are-now/article_33d88e7b-08f9-5f9f-b658-5a45ba43eee6.html). This failed. * Republicans then tried to [put a bill to remove it back on the ballot under the cover of COVID-19](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article242407526.html) and using such biased language that [it was rejected by the courts](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/cole-county-judge-tosses-ballot-language-for-gop-backed-repeal-of-clean-missouri/article_0becec62-5612-583f-bd79-b00d3c371139.html).

This got rid of the non-partisan commission, and again changed the criteria used to draw maps to allow Republicans to gerrymander. To get people to vote for it, they made insignificant changes to campaign finances (lowering the contribution limit by $100) so they could say this was about ethics in ~~game journalism~~ politics. This passed with 51% of the vote.  **MEDICAID Expansion**  In 2020, Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment that expanded access to MEDICAID to allow the state to qualify for more federal funds. This passed by a bit over 53% of the voters.  * Republicans first tried to simply [not fund the changes](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/08/985033020/missouri-legislature-tries-to-back-out-of-voter-approved-medicaid-expansion) and just not let people enroll. After stalling for over a year and a half, [the state supreme court told them they had to](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article253390153.html) (duh).  **Right-to-Work**  Republicans passed a union busting ""Right-to-Work"" bill in 2017.  * In 2018, pro-labor groups gathered enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot to overturn this. [Voters were successful with \~72% of the vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/08/636568530/missouri-blocks-right-to-work-law). * Although Republicans haven't been able to overturn this, they [keep saying they want to](https://www.senate.mo.gov/21web/sen-eric-burlison-continues-right-to-work-fight/).  **Puppy Mills**  It's hard to get more cartoonishly evil than cruelty to puppies, but that's Missouri Republicans for you. In 2010, voters passed a bill to address issues with unregulated puppy mills in the state.   * In 2011, Republicans passed modifications to this bill [gutting many of its key components](https://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=4075538). * In 2014, Republicans proposed a constitutional amendment nicknamed the ""right to farm"" which was widely supported by breeders and [recognized to include language to weaken protections further](https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2014/07/24/humane-society-spends-k-beat-right-farm/13098951/). * Since then MO Republicans [continue to try to weaken regulations](https://www.ksdk.com/article/life/animals/missouri-worst-puppy-mills-get-worse-if-new-bills-pass/63-8a4093fb-f505-4aac-aa8b-22e94c9e2242) even further.     If you notice, several of the above are constitutional amendments. Missouri voters tend to have to rely on this because it's harder for Republicans to overturn. So what do they do? They're trying to [make it harder for citizens to put things on the ballot](https://themissouritimes.com/house-passes-measures-to-raise-threshold-for-initiative-petitions/), as well as [change the rules for constitutional amendments, again making it harder](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article275221416.html).

I don't think there's any state which so consistently votes for progressive measures, and then elects politicians who want to do the exact opposite.   **Abortion Rights**  In 2024, Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment to protect abortion.  * When the amendment went on the ballot, Republicans tried to [scuttle it by using confusing ballot language which the courts blocked](https://www.firstalert4.com/2024/09/05/missouri-judge-rules-that-abortion-rights-amendment-language-november-ballot-is-misleading/). * Missouri Republicans are busy trying to undermine this by [putting it back on the ballot, agian with misleading language](https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-senate-vote-proposed-abortion-ban-constitutional-amendment/). * Since Missouri Republicans have gotten slapped down for using misleading ballot language in the past (see below), Republicans are [now trying to prevent courts from being able to stop them](https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-04-15/missouri-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-court-involvement-with-ballot-language).  **Minimum Wage**  Also in 2024, Missouri voters passed an increase in the minimum wage, tie-minimum wage to inflation, and mandate sick-leave and family-leave for certain workers.  * Republicans have been [busy trying to figure out how to undermine or repeal this](https://missouriindependent.com/2025/02/05/missouri-republicans-consider-delaying-voter-approved-minimum-wage-hike-paid-sick-leave/).  **CLEAN Act**  Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment that included ethics reform (limiting lobbyist gifts, lengthened the amount of time between leaving the legislature and becoming a lobbyist, expanded sunshine law to all state legislators) and would prevent gerrymandering (using a non-partisan commission to create maps that ensured partisan fairness and competitiveness, contiguousness, compactness, and followed clearly established city or county boundaries instead of chopping them up). This was approved by over 62% of the voters.  * Republicans first [tried to gut the rules](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/voters-in-missouri-approved-ethics-reform-republican-lawmakers-are-now/article_33d88e7b-08f9-5f9f-b658-5a45ba43eee6.html).

This got rid of the non-partisan commission, and again changed the criteria used to draw maps to allow Republicans to gerrymander. To get people to vote for it, they made insignificant changes to campaign finances (lowering the contribution limit by $100) so they could say this was about ethics in ~~game journalism~~ politics. This passed with 51% of the vote.  **MEDICAID Expansion**  In 2020, Missouri voters passed a constitutional amendment that expanded access to MEDICAID to allow the state to qualify for more federal funds. This passed by a bit over 53% of the voters.  * Republicans first tried to simply [not fund the changes](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/08/985033020/missouri-legislature-tries-to-back-out-of-voter-approved-medicaid-expansion) and just not let people enroll.

[Voters were successful with \~72% of the vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/08/636568530/missouri-blocks-right-to-work-law). * Although Republicans haven't been able to overturn this, they [keep saying they want to](https://www.senate.mo.gov/21web/sen-eric-burlison-continues-right-to-work-fight/).  **Puppy Mills**  It's hard to get more cartoonishly evil than cruelty to puppies, but that's Missouri Republicans for you.

"Okay, a few problems:  First, the voter suppression. 2020 elections, all of Indianapolis got one early voting center until like the last week. That's a 2m+ metro. The suburbs practically had an early voting center in every retirement community. The guy in charge of early voting was a Republican (may he rot in hell) who kept insisting Indy didn't need any more voting locations right up until the end. Did you know our city tried to elect a black mayor back in the day and the state *expanded the city's borders forcibly* to dilute the vote? There's so, so much more and it's all awful.  Second, Dems have functionally turned ourselves into mythological creatures across much of the country. I don't think you understand what this means:  >local Dem party has been so ineffective that they've been functionally invisible for decades.  There is a near-total messaging void that Republicans are free to fill with whatever they want. Every \~4 years, some national party politician will come down our way to pump fake in front of a factory/cornfield, often while saying vaguely condescending things about the Midwest. And that's it. A lot of people don't like Trump. They just genuinely have no idea what we stand for, they never hear our platform, and they talk to a Dem maybe once every few months. That's not just a ""Fox News misinformation"" problem. We're completely absent and that lets Republicans frame us however they want.  Just for reference on how bad it is, unions (aside from a few survivors) have been functionally outlawed for so long that most inhabitants have no idea what they are. You need class privilege & a political history education to go that far back in time, which defeats the purpose of appealing to the working class. So when you hear us Dems associate labor and unions, that association doesn't work because it is flat-out missing for some of the places that need it the most. Republicans took the strategy of rigging these states and waiting for people who remembered the before-times to literally die of old age, and it's worked pretty well.",Sminahin,2025-05-05T10:28:19,13
"We will still have elections, yes. I really wish people would stop with the ""no elections"" nonsense. It's just that we will have elections in the same way Russia has ""elections"".",milt0r6,2025-05-05T09:24:53,7

Republicans don’t want to bridge the gap. If that gap’s bridged then they can’t win off of an obscure culture war issue.,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-05T09:31:20,3
Nothing suspicious about one of the most polarizing figures in American history just crushing all of the swing states he needed to barely clinch the EC. Nope.,_Burning_Star_IV_,2025-05-05T21:21:52,3
So it sounds like the state’s historically been like that… as in the people there have supported these republican policies. Republicans don’t need to rig elections because voters already hand them supermajorities in state legislature and keep it a deep red state in the federal elections.   You say a lot of people don’t like Trump yet they overwhelmingly vote for him. They had plenty of opportunity and time to listen to the democrat platform during election season and it still didn’t matter. At some point you gotta realize that this is truly how the people are and that this is exactly what they wanted.,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-05T12:20:39,2
">So it sounds like the state’s historically been like that  Nope. Complicated place--contributed the most soldiers per capita to the union, iirc, but also the center of the second-wave Klan movement. Second most idle factories after Michigan and hit heavily by the post-Reagan economy. We always leaned conservative and a lot of our Dems were Republicrats, but there was a long tradition of Dem governors and we had some of the more reasonable Republicans. Lugar wasn't perfect, but he was a sincere man of principles. Dedicated his life to nuclear safety and tried to save my life as a kid (not realizing I wasn't in danger). I can respect that.  There was a stark transition around the 90s. There's been a lot of lit on how campaigns and party infrastructure restructured around then--how things transitioned from more local political systems and organizations into fundraiser call lists. Imo that switch hit regions like mine extra badly. Because again the party is just completely absent.  >You say a lot of people don’t like Trump yet they overwhelmingly vote for him.   Yes, and it's obvious why. They think we're worse. And honestly, you need to be pretty politically engaged & educated in these regions to think we're better. Again because of that messaging void. We've had nonexistent messaging for generations, so anyone who supports Dem pretty much does so because of their own research & initiative and not because of anything the party has done to win them.  >They had plenty of opportunity and time to listen to the democrat platform during election season and it still didn’t matter  Have you been reading any of my points? Because this is the exact opposite of everything I've been saying. It's simply not true. Not only was our platform basically nonexistent the last few electoral cycles, not only have we been actively ignoring the economic issues people in these areas have been wanting us to run on since Reagan, but they also didn't have that opportunity or time to listen--not unless they're a high-engagement political type, and you wonder why we're losing along straight classism lines. Because we're not there selling anything to anyone. Which is the entire point of my post.",Sminahin,2025-05-05T12:35:07,0
"You don’t become the center of the second-wave klan movement without there being heavy local support for it. So the post Reagan economy screwed them over, and they’ve kept voting for it. This is what doesn’t make sense.   You have a state that’s always been heavily republican with no indication whatsoever of change or willingness to change their voting habits and then wonder why the national party doesn’t really focus on it. You don’t need to have a degree or be super into politics to watch the national news, or the debates, or what the candidates say, and Indiana still voted heavily for Trump.   They chose tariffs and economic collapse. If they were worried about idle factories before, forget it, they got Trump to wreck any existing factories. Even when Biden was running on bringing back normalcy and revitalizing the Midwest with infrastructure funding and manufacturing, they still went Trump by 16 points.",Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-05T13:46:41,1
