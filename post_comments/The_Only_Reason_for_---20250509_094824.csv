"His background in canon law to allow him to write more of his own messages instead of giving an idea he wanted expressed, his familiarity with Vatican workings, and executive leadership relatable to fixing the Vatican banking issues might have also been factors...",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-09T10:06:17,32
So first every country's election is controlled by Trump now the selection of the Pope? Is Trump really this powerful of an individual?,Hectoriu,2025-05-09T09:53:34,37
I’m trying to remember the last time I cared what the pope thought politically…  Oh that’s right… NEVER…,BerniWrightson,2025-05-09T15:51:59,3

"There are many ways to interpret this decision and none of us have any clue what the motivations are.   Was an American Pope selected to help tame the American government?   Was an American Pope selected as a form of endorsing what America is doing currently, or to show solidarity with America as one of the last bastions of Western Civilization?   Who knows.   Pope Leo is also a pretty young guys, so he might be at it for a decade or two. You'd think they'd be considering more than the less than four years that Trump has left.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-09T12:25:24,3
"This seems obviously true. It's been talked about for decades how there would never be an American pope unless the country was seen by church leadership as being in decline.  Francis elevated 108/135 voters, was very pro-migration, and his last action on this Earth was coincidentally meeting with our Catholic VP who this pope and Pope Francis criticized for being anti-migration.  The good thing-- the population of people who would become pro-migration because the pope said so is dwindling. Liberals are abandoning religiosity, illegal immigrants are being deported, and legal immigration is being slowed.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-09T10:21:19,-8
I had the same thought. A lot like picking a Polish Pope during the Solidarity unrest. It was definitely a message.   This Pope has been chosen to augment domestic pressure in fighting Trump's agenda. My hope is that if the new Pope becomes really intrusive that Trump will - instead of name-calling - suggest the pontiff concentrate on spiritual matters and let the President run the government.,Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T11:21:11,-7
"Yes, he goes against the globalist agenda and America typically leads the way in terms of politics and culture for the rest of the world. They will do everything in their power to hamstring him.",BattleIllustrious680,2025-05-09T09:59:14,-6
>t's been talked about for decades how there would never be an American pope unless the country was seen by church leadership as being in decline.   No it hasn't. The first time this was ever brought up was by Robert Barron last weekend lol.,Opening-Citron2733,2025-05-09T12:06:15,16
"JPII was elected pope in 1978, the solidarity union was founded in 1980. When did the Catholic Church get a time machine?  I don't think Trump being president had anything to do with the election of Leo XIV. Why would the cardinals care about Trump?",puzzical,2025-05-09T11:42:45,15
"Yes- 2016 was a total fluke. Everyone and I mean every political player in the world thought Hillary was going to win. Her campaign popped bottles on the private jet the well before polls closed on Election Day.  Soros and the world’s dark money never saw it coming. Trump ran at the exact right moment after many Americans were put off after obamas 4 years. Trump unilaterally altered the course of world politics and many Americans are loving it. This is probably the first time the “powers that be” truly lost control of the global agenda.  I fucking love it, light em up donny!",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T10:55:49,14

They use the time machine during the Conclave to help them pick. That's why they're so secretive.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-09T12:22:19,0
"\>JPII was elected pope in 1978, the solidarity union was founded in 1980.   You're right. Thanks for the reminder.  \>I don't think Trump being president had anything to do with the election of Leo XIV. Why would the cardinals care about Trump?  You're suggesting the Catholic Church is either unaware or uninterested in what is happening in the USA via the Trump revolution. I would venture to guess that the Church receives more income from the USA than any other country in the world (though I could be wrong). They likely care deeply about what's happening in the States.  Furthermore, Leo's immediate predecessor was obviously a liberal on almost every issue except abortion. There is every possibility that the political orientation of the College of Cardinals - the men who elected Francis and now Leo - is reflected in their choices for pontiff, that the majority are liberals, and that they view Trump and his agenda through that prism.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T15:05:31,1
