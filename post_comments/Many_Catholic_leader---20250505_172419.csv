I tried to post this as a separate thread but it was removed.   This is a man who thinks he could be the Pope describing his favorite Bible verse.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE),tinyE1138,2025-05-05T19:29:37,1

"I’m not so sure Catholic leaders support Trump.  Self-identified Catholic voters? Yeah, they tend to vote Trump but less so than White Evangelicals. Mainly because of abortion.

You are absolutely correct on that furthermore looks like Trump is trying to promote his own style of religion. Something that the constitution had it clear separation of church and the state,AceCombat9519,2025-05-05T17:42:24,9

Catholic voters were largely split with Democrats winning a slim share until 2016. Biden won back the Catholic vote 52 to Trump’s 47.   Harris massively lost the Catholic vote to Trump.,TonyzTone,2025-05-05T18:27:03,2
