">Slotkin, who spoke with Politico last week, urged her fellow party members to stop using the term “oligarch” — a word she herself has used to describe Russian billionaire allies of Vladimir Putin on X.

I would like a stats company to figure out exactly what percentage of Americans know what oligarchy means. I’d estimate maybe 50%. Smart people generally overestimate what the general public knows about their field.   Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/2501/,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-28T13:10:33,8
"Americans have spent the past 80 years obsessed with hating ""socialism"". Yet few are able to vaguely describe what 'socialism' is and why they oppose it.

"I know Bernie's heart is in the right place, but his problem has always been that he's an excellent communicator to the people who are already inclined to agree with him, and terrible at winning over people who aren't. This is a prime example.   Sure, if you're talking to Bernie fans, they know what oligarchy means, so go ahead and use that word. If you're trying to win over Trump voters or most non-voters, put it in simpler terms, and talk about corrupt billionaires conspiring to steal your retirement and health care, and drive up prices, so they can get even richer.

JFC Bernie what the hell is wrong with you?  OF COURSE the American public lacks intelligence. All we need for proof are the results of the 2016 and 2024 elections and the fact 74 million people voted for Trump in 2020 AFTER he was personally responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Do you realize how unbelievably ignorant people have to be to vote for someone like that THREE f'ng times?  The fact Sanders keeps wanting Democrats to cater to these lunatics makes me question \*his\* intelligence.,InALostHorizon,2025-04-28T16:42:19,2

Backing down at every opportunity like a bunch of spineless twits is not and has never been the solution to our political problems. She’s right about that.  Democrats need to not be weak and woke.  They need to be strong and woke. We don’t need to be throwing marginalized people under the bus to appease the biggest pieces of shit in the room. Fuck that bullshit. We need to confront this bullshit head on and bully the bullies into submission. If they don’t like it they can go fuck themselves and kick rocks.,makavellius,2025-04-28T13:48:12,21

Who is he not winning over though minus a few senators? Him and AOC have made record turnout in a non election year with this oligarchy tour while the base is in open revolt with Schumer et al.

People don’t vote for people who think they’re better than them, which is a large part of the reason we have trump.    I personally think most people are stupid, but I’m not in charge.

"The point, and reality - is that both candidates and parties are products and subservient to oligarchy.  Voting for president doesn't't stop oligarchy in this case.   What might is mass demonstrations, running progressives for office, getting money out of politics, grassroots organizing, labour action, etc.   Whining about non voters serves no purpose other than to play into what the oligarchy wants - Americans mad at each other instead of at them.

I wonder how many people faced just life hardships that stymied their ability to vote.

"Slotkin would agree with you, yes, but voters in the middle of the country are capable of understanding a term, especially a concept they can easily relate to. Her alternative to oligarch is “king” - which isn’t the same. Oligarch appeals because voters feel economically squeezed and the reason is because a handful of people at the top (oligarchs) have all the wealth - if middle American voters don’t know this term, they can initiatively understand it - the rich have been getting richer and the poor and middle class getting poorer for a long time now, it’s just not that hard to understand.",loud-oranges,2025-04-28T17:47:34,2
"Who is Slotkin to tell Bernie how to advocate for working class issues/better language while he's generating record turnout across middle America(outside of liberal enclaves)? It's like me giving LeBron jump shot advice from a folding chair.   What's insidious about her critique [to use ""King"" instead] is to shift focus back onto Trump from the super rich donor class that feeds both GOP and Dems alike while dictating policy.

Politics 101 is about chasing votes, and it's not the electorate's job to coddle politicians(while they accuse their base of being too dumb to understand the definition of 'oligarchy').
