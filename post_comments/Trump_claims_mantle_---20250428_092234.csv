"Both Presidents are known for shaking things up – one with the New Deal, the other with turning the White House into a reality TV set. Totally the same.",TubeframeMR2,2025-04-28T09:27:30,11

"I was wondering what FDR would say to Trump, so I asked ChatGPT:  **1. On the Role of the Presidency:**   *""The Presidency is not an office of personal aggrandizement. It is a sacred trust with the people. The measure of success is not wealth or fame, but the security, opportunity, and dignity afforded to the common man. Have you used your office to lift up the many, or only to glorify the few?""*  **2. On Democracy and Institutions:**   *""Democracy is not a machine run by privilege. It is the government of the people, by the people, for the people. When you sow distrust in free elections, in the courts, and in the press, you do not merely strike at your opponents — you strike at the foundation of American liberty.""*  **3. On National Unity:**   *""The strength of America lies in its unity — not its divisions. True leadership binds wounds, it does not tear them wider. Are your words and deeds healing the nation, or are they deepening its scars?""*  **4. On Fear and Responsibility:**   *""We faced a Great Depression and a World War. I told the nation that 'the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' A president should never exploit fear for personal advantage. Fear must be overcome with courage, not inflamed for gain.""*  **5. On Service and Sacrifice:**   *""Public service demands sacrifice — not self-enrichment. It demands vision — not vanity. History does not remember those who shouted the loudest, but those who labored most tirelessly for the public good.""*  FDR was no stranger to political battles and was a savvy, sometimes ruthless politician, but he held a profound, almost sacred view of democratic government and the presidency.   He would likely view Trump’s approach as dangerously transactional, divisive, and corrosive to the norms that protect American democracy.",ChipDriverMystery,2025-04-28T09:28:14,5

"He would view Trump just as he viewed his predecessors in Germany and Italy. A threat to the nation, and to all of the free world.",CrashB111,2025-04-28T09:50:09,5
