"Trump is physically incapable of humor.  It's well documented that he literally has no understanding of humor.  He throws around stupid shit, and when/if that stupid shit gets thrown back at him he's suddenly ""Joking"".",JadedIT_Tech,2025-05-06T12:48:52,8
"I just really sometimes can't believe how preposterously childish and naive so much of the voter base must be to even publish headlines like this.   Of course they deserve a serious response. This man staged a coup. Like five years ago. Of course he's not joking about being a forever dictator. He staged. A. Fucking. Coup.   He was very almost thrown in a small cell for the rest of his life until the American fucking people voted to make him above the law in the greatest failure of collective action the modern world has ever seen.  None of his jokes are jokes. A person in his position should not even be joking because it is egregiously irresponsible at best. But they aren't jokes, they are future intentions.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T12:58:07,5

"I hope congress and senate start doing their actual job of defending our country and our people from this criminal president.  Your job is the constitution, not kissing his orange ass.  ",arilupe,2025-05-06T12:56:47,1

He was obviously joking…or was he?   Who can tell?  It’s Tuesday. See what Wednesday brings. He might change his mind.,Chiguy2792,2025-05-06T13:46:17,1

"Yeah, because he's a malignant narcissist and physically incapable of ""just joking"".   He might frame it that way, but all his jokes have a mean-spirited half joking vibe to them, and often they are just a test run for what he *really* means and wants to do.  He just needs to see how people would respond and if he could get away with it.   I mean, are we pretending he *wouldn't* accept the role of pope, or run for a 3rd term if he could?",NihilisticPollyanna,2025-05-07T08:43:11,1

People are dying while the republicans crack jokes...  The republican party is a gang of criminals.,Actual__Wizard,2025-05-06T12:54:44,7
"Truth.  He tests the waters with his statements, and if enough blowback happens then he calls it a joke.  He has no wit and no humor.",dbuck1964,2025-05-06T12:50:44,8
"The voter base doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. Some think they know, some are sure they know. And if they know they don’t know, they pretend they do know.",Humbuhg,2025-05-06T13:14:00,3
"The upside, if I dare calling it that, is the longer he plays with the idea of a 3rd term is time the GOP can’t spend laying the groundwork for their 2028 nominee.",Virtual_Plantain_707,2025-05-06T17:02:46,1
