"""Ward is originally from Dublin and moved as a child to the US where she obtained a green card, attended the University of California, in Santa Cruz, now works for a non-profit, pays taxes and cares for a chronically ill son who is a US citizen, according to Holladay.  A criminal record for drug possession and misdemeanours from 2007 and 2008 was expunged at state level but not federal, which put her in the crosshairs of [Donald Trump’s crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) on documented as well as undocumented immigrants.  Earlier this year Ward accompanied her stepmother to [Ireland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland) to visit her father, who has dementia, and upon returning to the US was stopped at Seattle airport on 19 March and held for three days.  She was released to obtain documentation about the partially expunged convictions and presented them to Ice officials at San Francisco airport on 21 April, after which she was again detained, said Holladay.""  There is a list in the body of the article of other Western white people who are here legally and being detained.  So, again, someone follows the rules, goes in to clear up her being ""briefly"" held at the airport and gets nailed.  Low-hanging fruit is all ICE and Trump can manage.",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-08T08:23:51,180
"Conservatives have been telling us for years that this kind of technicality-driven, nitpicky approach to government is a source of great evil.  They've also been telling us to beware of our lives being ruled by government databases.  Yet here they are cheering all of it on.  The current generation of Republicans and Conservatives have forgotten who they are and are a disgrace to themselves and the country.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-08T08:28:44,147

"17 days for a legal resident? I thought they said it's a simple yes or no question which would maybe require 17 minutes.

"Always neat to see the bigots throw a bone to the old-school haters out there, who undoubtedly are part of the Trump base. I'm sure they had a wonderful time popping a few boner pills and beating off to the locking up of the Irish woman in her 50s. Makes them feel young again. Big win for conservatives.

"Legally, they could throw someone in prison for 5 years over downloading a single movie. But I think a lot of people would talk about it despite being technically legal because it would be grossly disproportional.  A lot of people will always discuss morality and proportionality of actions and not just say ""fine it's technically permitted"", so yes the sole carer for a son with special needs being thrown in a detention facility for 17 days for a misdemeanor from 17 years ago that got expunged at state level is a story worthy to tell to show how the frenzy about deportation numbers made a lot of officials forget about proportionality and humanity.",IcehandGino,2025-05-08T09:31:41,24
Except she got her green card and had it renewed and it’s entirely legal. She’s legal. Her charges were waived. She’s been paying taxes and contributing to America for two decades since.
