At what point does it become taxation without representation The federal government seems to want to stop basically all spending and put it all on states despite people paying for these federal programs that were implemented into law.,sedatedlife,2025-05-02T18:34:34,44
"At some point you have to wonder what's the point of being part of the United States if there are literally no benefits to being part of the country.   Like, they're cutting everything.

The money he saves by cutting support for poorer people will just go into his pocket and into the pockets of the super-rich to furher enrich them.   'Evil' doesn't begin to describe this vile criminal.,crazybones,2025-05-03T05:31:00,3

"Trump wants a $6T tax cut for the top 0.01%, and he's willing to take everything from the American people to get it. Sadly, that 30%-35% of Americans who are Trump supporters would gladly give Trump everything they own and happily sleep outside in a parking lot in a cardboard box for him, ""because he's the Messiah""!

My cousin gets HUD assistance. She's a mentally disabled individual who makes sub-minium wage and rents a room with a kitchenette in someone's basement.   Without a HUD subsidy she will be homeless.  The answer to housing costs isn't to restrict the number of people who are housed. It's to increase the number of homes.,NoCoolNameMatt,2025-05-02T23:10:32,11

"Sure doesn’t. But if the federal government collected the taxes in good faith for these programs, then they can give it back to the states. If not, then what would you want the federal government spending it on?",CatsEqualLife,2025-05-02T22:19:29,4

"Finally, a voice of reason.  These liberals believe they are entitled to things, as long as they don't have to pay for them.  Let the rich pay.  Wrong.

The problem is you guys don't want to do that either. You add so many regulations that building smaller more affordable homes becomes unprofitable so home builders need to resort to building larger more expensive homes to stay profitable. The fix to this problem is to get rid of the subsidies and regulations and let the market sort things out form there ,Grumblepugs2000,2025-05-02T23:14:28,-5

"I cannot hear you clearly with Trump’s Ill-fitting lifts jammed in your muzzle.   I would much rather my tax dollars go to helping the less fortunate, the folks with fewer opportunities, the folks from whom disaster has taken everything. I would rather my tax dollars go towards maintaining infrastructure, towards research and development, towards medicine and other advancements.  I do not personally want anything from them. I want them to be used by government to help our people. All of them.    Instead I am watching as my tax dollars are instead being gently poured down the 18th hole on a golf course by a melting man who has it out for the rest of the world.",Xsnulz,2025-05-02T19:37:21,6
I see nothing wrong with a barista working full time for $12/hr getting a section 8 voucher.    Somebody has to make coffee for people too ill equipped to do it themselves but willing to pay $7 a cup for someone else to.    It’s called the working poor and they do jobs that society wants done.    Trump golfed 23 days out of his first 92 days in office.   Travel to Florida cost American taxpayers in excess of $18 million.  Fucking ridiculous.,The2CommaClub,2025-05-03T09:18:58,2

"What will his cousin do while ""the market sorts it out""?   What of people with disabilities who have no family to fall back on?  HUD housing serves a very important role in protecting our most vulnerable from homelessness and death.

"Getting rid of zoning regulations would go along with ""getting rid of regulations"".
