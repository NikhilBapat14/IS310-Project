The world certainly seemed to be drifting right but Trump is such a disaster it really gave people pause.  A few months ago the Conservatives were going to utterly destroy the Liberals in Canada and now here we are with a fourth straight Liberal government in a country that loves nothing better than voting parties out of power.,-Mage-Knight-,2025-05-03T16:02:31,35
"What I find so confusing for the Canadian and Australian elections is that there’s absolutely no reason conservatives *outside the US* need to align themselves with Trump. He doesn’t actually stand for anything, and criticizing him guarantees he’ll attack you, which is a ton of free press.   On top of that, Democrats, for all intents and purposes, are usually as right leaning in practice as right wing candidates in other Western nations.",kevihaa,2025-05-03T17:23:43,27

Key thing that strikes me as an Australian is how respectful and gracious both parties are to their opponents after the election.   There isn’t the hate and toxicity that you see in the US.   From a strategy perspective the Australian conservatives moved to the right (perhaps encouraged by Trump) and abandoned the centre ground - and they’ve been annihilated as a result.,AusFrosty,2025-05-03T19:00:10,31

"The Albanese ALP government was destined to be returned for a second term and was facing very poor campaigning from a lacklustre LNP opposition.  It was however facing a reduced majority in its second term or even a minority government as has always been the case throughout Australian political history.  That the LNP opposition was bereft of costed and credible policies was bad enough. Its leader , Peter Dutton , was a terrible salesman and tried to apply Trump-Lite policies which blew up in his face.  The Trump tariffs and all of the rest of his destabilising political madness then blew up midway through a short election.  This contribution to rising anxiety can certainly be attributed as a factor in the ALP government being returned with a historic second term increased majority but quantifying this is almost impossible,  It is therefore a little rich to suggest that Trump was entirely or even majorly responsible for its victory and it is clear that this ALP government was clearly re-elected on its merits and against a very poor opposition.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T17:53:30,26

"I’m not sure the nuclear thing really played such a big role in removing Dutton from Dickson (as a resident of the area). I think Dutton’s distaste of the area (not helping in a cyclone, wanting to move to the Sydney residence if he won), Ali France’s name recognition as someone running for the third time and a credible independent reminding people that change was a possibility helped more. The nuclear thing was more ‘he’s a bit out of touch’ rather than ‘he’s a threat to Dickson’",AshamedChemistry5281,2025-05-03T19:39:47,2

"As a leftist in the U.S., if Carney and Albanese govern as neoliberal leaders in Canada, Australia, etc. then I worry that we're seeing Biden types who won't decimate right wing fascists as needed. Fascism must be destroyed. Their propaganda must be obliterated and their leaders stripped of all power and punished. Actual leftist policies must be instituted, and multi-cultural equity must be aggressively fought for and defended. If these liberals aren't willing to do that (like the Biden admin failed to do), then I hope this is not their 1 round of milquetoast centrism before fascists win. Trump seemed politically done Jan 6, 2021. But he, other billionaires and bigots, and right wing media were allowed to poison the public, institutions, and (probably steal) getting elected again. My hope is that our allies in other countries still have enough knowledge of and commitment to real leftist politics and defense structures so they do this and fight fascism by any means necessary.",RocketSocket765,2025-05-03T17:54:16,1

But it's an extremely wrong lesson to learn, because Trump *isn't* all that popular, even in the US. Sure, he won the popular vote here, but if we include the *potential* US electorate, ""nobody"" was the most popular candidate. And even among the *actual* electorate he didn't break 50% of the vote (though he came close).  But right-wing media looked at that performance and declared him the winner of a massive landslide. They would shout in their echo chambers that Harris got smoked. They would even venture in here to say it.

The majority of Democrats, particularly economically, would place very solidly in most European conservative parties.

"Most liberals in Canadian govt have better policies more similar to social dems than those in the U.S. Dem party. I'm a democratic socialist. What I mean by ""neoliberalism"" is liberal parties that, instead of requiring that human rights must be provided for, they make deals with capital that's hoarding control and access to those. Deals that lead to privatization of human rights.  For example, I'm not familiar with all Canadian housing policy, and I'm sure it's better than in the U.S., but [ it looks like there's similar problems where capital owns a bunch of the available housing instead of people. ](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housing-investors-canada-bc-1.6743083) This is growing feudalism. In the U.S., activists have suggested capping the number of homes that can be owned by investment funds (instead of people), or vacancy taxes, so capital doesn't hoard housing while the homeless stack up. I could be wrong, but it seems like the proposal Carney has is similar to U.S. Dem politicians, i.e. - promote the idea of a housing ""shortage"" (which sure - more housing would be good too, but it downplays the greed and harm of capital hoarding houses), and give tons of taxpayer money to developers to build more housing (going to the same investment companies+ developers hoarding housing, with vague assurances about ""affordability"").  I see these kinds of ""kill the poor slower + kinder than the conservatives"" schemes from many liberal parties. It's often coupled with not fighting oligarchs that peddle fascism and bigotry, because liberals tend to want power + comfortability from deals with capital more than ""too aggressive"" or revolutionary policies. So, the fascists take over, not by being correct, but by breaking things and weaponizing bigotry around fake scarcity for human needs and never being punished and destroyed. I mean this in good faith and know the U.S. is much worse. You all held the line up there against fascism and it's beautiful. I'm just worried it'll happen there too (and everywhere these bastards are trying). I am curious to look at what Germany did in labeling AfD as extremists this week. I'm hopeful since German leaders seem to be saying they will not permit the horrors of WWII again that Trump, MAGA, Musk, and right wing oligarchs world wide want. People there know it must be stomped out.",RocketSocket765,2025-05-04T13:45:40,1

All Trump has done is made people feel like it is okay to be loud and proud about being a vile human, there have been authoritarian regimes popping up well before Trump and his ilk. If your just now noticing it in the last 9 years, your about 100 years behind.  Right-Wing Authoritarian Regimes (1920s–Today)  1. Fascist Italy (1922–1943) – Mussolini’s dictatorship; nationalist, anti-communist.   2. Nazi Germany (1933–1945) – Hitler’s regime; extreme racism, militarism, genocide.   3. Francoist Spain (1939–1975) – Franco’s rule; Catholic nationalism, repression.   4. Salazar’s Portugal (1933–1974) – Conservative dictatorship; anti-democratic, colonialist.   5. Latin American Juntas (1960s–1980s)     - Brazil (1964–1985) – U.S.-backed military rule.      - Argentina (1976–1983) – ""Dirty War"" against leftists.      - Chile (1973–1990) – Pinochet’s brutal free-market dictatorship.   6. Apartheid South Africa (1948–1994) – White-minority rule enforcing racial segregation.   7. Vichy France (1940–1944) – Puppet regime collaborating with Nazis.   8. Modern Right-Wing Authoritarians      -  Hungary (2010–present) – Orbán’s ""illiberal democracy.""      - Turkey (2010s–present) – Erdoğan’s crackdown on dissent.      - India (2010s–present) – Modi’s Hindu nationalist policies.   9. Trump’s U.S. (2017–2021; 2025–?) – Erosion of democratic norms, attacks on institutions.   10. Others    - Fujimori’s Peru (1990–2000) – Corruption, autocratic rule.      - Ortega’s Nicaragua (2007–present) – Started left-wing, turned repressive.    Common Traits - Nationalism – Glorifies the nation, often with xenophobia.   - Anti-Leftism – Crushes socialism, unions, and liberals.   - Authoritarian Control – Silences media, rigs elections, jails opponents.",Faithu,2025-05-03T20:07:30,29
