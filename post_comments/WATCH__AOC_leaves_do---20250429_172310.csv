The democratic establishment won't let that happen. She's too far left. If she does run she's gonna get treated just like Bernie did. Newsome is gonna be the chosen one. Mark my words,eschwifty,2025-04-29T17:35:58,366

"I know on paper she seems like a slam dunk to beat‚Ä¶but I would caution people to just blow her off.  Don‚Äôt underestimate her, if she has a large following, she could win the Democrat primary. The Democrat base is just itching to put in a far left candidate, and I think the 2028 conditions could be perfect.  Not to mention, the media will no doubt attempt to prop her up immediately after.  Remember, when Trump came down the escalator in 2015, no one (or very few) took him seriously.",RotoDog,2025-04-29T19:11:44,94
"It is far too early to say who will get the nod from the DNC. Yes, right now Gavin Newsom looks like the most likely contender, but don't forget in 2008, everyone thought Hillary was definitely going to win the nomination only for some unknown upstart named Obama to come and win over the minds not just of the people but even the DNC.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-29T19:21:41,12

"Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo, a veteran of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, said that Ocasio-Cortez appears to be one of a small group of politicians in his party who ""are test ballooning a potential 2028 run for the presidency"" as Democrats search ""for a path out of the wilderness.""  ‚ÄúA path out of the wilderness‚Äù , why are democrats in the wilderness?

"I agree with the sentiment, but I think she is a paper tiger. Thus far, she has been treated with kid gloves. None of her public scrutiny has been in arenas that actually affect her political career. Her claim to fame are the likes of the green new deal, which is some real sophomoric nonsense.  In an arena against people like Newsome or Vance, she will look naive at best.",moashforbridgefour,2025-04-30T01:12:29,11

"I wouldnt underestimate her in debates. If Kamala could get through it and have the left actually believing she won the debate against Trump, AOC can. (Though I think Trump is terrible at 1v1 debates)  On a more positive note - What AOC cant do, and Kamala failed to do, is sit for 2-3 hours on a non-sycophant podcast (eg Rogan) without several devastating soundbytes likely being produced. Mainstream media/debates pale in comparison to the power of long form discussion in this new age of media. Case in point, Trump bombed the debates (including the Biden one tbh) but was successful with the podcasts.",avd51133333,2025-04-29T19:24:48,14

You underestimate just how much the left hates Jews. That's the reason he wasn't picked as Harris's VP last year. He was a clear front runner and got passed over for Walz because the dems know their base is rabidly antisemitic,The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-30T00:58:37,22

"I think you misunderstood me. I think Biden bowing out late was the plan. I told my friends I thought that would be the strategy back as far as 2023- wait until the last possible moment to bait and switch the candidate so that 1. The democrats would have no choice but to rally behind a single, obvious candidate without any infighting, and 2. Waste republican's campaign efforts on attacking Biden instead of Harris.  That only would have worked if Biden could have held it together enough to be an actual, viable candidate. Then he could get sick or have a family crisis and decide to honorably bow out.
