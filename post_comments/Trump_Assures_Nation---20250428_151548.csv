"ANY other President, boss, Owner, CEO,  would have fired a POS like Hegseth in a heartbeat. Then again, they wouldn't have put that moron loser POS in that position in the first place.

"Might as well have hired Diddy as head of the DOJ.  I used to think it a far fetched idea that Trump was a Russian agent, with directives to demolish the US hegemony that the world relied on. A conspiracy theory.       But he demolished the US hegemony that the world relied on, and put the absolute worst people in charge, and has actively destabilized our economy, reducing it by over 20%. All while not putting any tariffs on Russian and Belarusian goods/services.  If he was a Russian agent, what would he be doing differently? He's already legitimizing Putin's invasion of Ukraine. He's pushed Ukraine for a Molotov-Ribbentrop style splitting of Ukraine's resources between the US and Russia, and he's pushed a peace plan that includes Ukraine surrendering thousands of square miles that they currently control, just giving Putin everything he wants.   Will people finally believe it when he sells half the islands of Alaska to Russia? Or when he does nothing as Russia uses tactical nukes?      Or will it take him outright trying to have the US join the Russian Federation, Surrendering to Russia entirely in a war we didn't fight, for people to finally see that his allegiances lie elsewhere?",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-04-28T16:55:27,5
