"this sounds familiar.  People should be immediately terrified right now, and if you aren't, please go do a history lesson so you can feel sick to your stomach too.  [Hitler purged the judiciary system.](https://www.fedbar.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/legalcomm-sept13-pdf-1.pdf)  [(Turkey (Erdoğan)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purges_in_Turkey_following_the_2016_Turkish_coup_attempt)  [Putin too](https://hrf.org/latest/show-trials-and-political-persecution-judiciary-in-putins-russia/)  Poland  Hungary   The list goes on.  This tactic is very very very bad sign and regardless of if you're a conservative in some form of denial or otherwise, this will impact everyone on some level.  Damn. We might just be actually cooked.",ergonomic_logic,2025-04-25T22:27:41,1
They've already released her if I'm seeing the news correctly. Someone shit their pants and even the dim bulbs in the Bondo department realize they may have fucked up with this one.,BLU3SKU1L,2025-04-25T22:33:09,1
Arresting a federal judge for defending due process. What country is this?,Nondescriptish,2025-04-25T22:23:52,1
"Anyone can be arrested for expressing free speech, (""Free Palestine""), defending due process, being anti-christian, being brown, defending warrantless search and seizure. Defy a Supreme Court ruling, commit 34 felonies, rape women and children and you get a seat in the Oval office.",Nondescriptish,2025-04-25T22:29:47,1
"During the Nazi era, the SA (Sturmabteilung), a paramilitary organization, targeted and intimidated judges who were perceived as being critical of the Nazi regime or who were Jewish. This was part of a broader pattern of the Nazis silencing opposition and establishing control over the legal system. Judges who resisted were often forced to retire or were removed from their positions.",williamgman,2025-04-26T00:06:08,1

"Are we slow-cooking this revolution?  Like, should we be basting it or letting it marinate a bit longer?  Does it need to ferment for optimal resistance flavor?  Is this an aged-for-20-years, served-cold kind of uprising?  Because, it's feeling less like a rebellion is going to happen and more like a sad simmer of ""we prob should, maybe"".",ergonomic_logic,2025-04-25T22:38:32,1

"The very incompetent, very weak, very dumb Trump admin is just baiting the resistance. Waiting for a violent act of resistance to justify invoking the Insurrection Act and declare Martial law. Revolution is built into the constitution.",Nondescriptish,2025-04-25T22:51:16,1
