A HUNDRED million?  How about maybe 5?  That’s an insane amount of money none of us will ever even get close to,casander14,2025-04-05T08:15:46,17
"The goal posts just keep moving. The number used to be $400k per year whenever we talked about tax bumps. We’re slowly acquiescing to conservatives and bumping the number of what we consider acceptable wealth higher and higher.   I’m a fan of Mark and I know his point is greater than $100M but we need to stop this.   Trumps strategy is to make everything more expensive for most Americans such that he can funnel more wealth into the pockets of a few. The only sane response is a fiscal policy that drives prices down for most, increases the citizen user experience, and yes, extracts most of its revenue from high earners, corporations, etc.",DinkandDrunk,2025-04-05T08:00:34,8

"I've been iffy on him for a while. Don't get me wrong, I think he's got a great story, he's an excellent asset in the Senate, and I admire the guy generally speaking. But his delivery skills? Meh. I feel like in the 21st century, to be president, you have to do better than that. I hate that this is where our attention span is at nowadays, but we've gotta be real. If swing voters don't get flash, they'll pick fash.  That said, there is a non-zero probability that America may be ready for meat-and-potatoes politicians in 2028. We all know that 2017-2021 was sensory overload during *those* Trump years, and I think that this term will bring that raised to the nth degree.  We'll have to see where we're at.",KR1735,2025-04-05T19:11:12,1

He’s running for president. I’ll bet money on it right now.,Eric848448,2025-04-05T12:20:31,7
That's the point he's making. It's an outrageous number and even then we won't tax them.   Why?  Hope?,swissarmychainsaw,2025-04-05T12:13:09,5

I feel like he's keeping it simple for the MAGA cultist. You got explain it simple for less educated folks,-Tasear-,2025-04-06T10:48:07,1
I think he's just a good person. Look at his wife too. He's like a man for the people finally,-Tasear-,2025-04-06T10:45:58,1
He’s a white man who was in the military.  Add to that he’s smart and shows no fear.  He’s a little middle of the road for me but until the the other white men who are afraid of poc and women come around this is the kind of person we need to run. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-06T14:52:41,1
