The ask felt to some like a directive, according to people familiar with the matter and messages reviewed by The Washington Post. Though defense officials were aware of Jennifer Hegseth’s quiet yet omnipresent role in her husband’s bruising Senate confirmation process and her background — like his — at Fox News, she had no experience working in government and — importantly, these people said — had not been appointed to any official role in the Trump administration.  “We would always hear that she was saying what kind of videos he should be doing, and what kind of statements he should be doing, and how the press should be handled,” recalled one person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a dynamic viewed inside the Pentagon as unorthodox and sometimes problematic.

"Not a fake democracy, we just have a bunch of randoms with no government experience running it.  People go on and on about needing something new and different than career politicians without realizing that you need some people who understand how these institutions are supposed to function. You can't take any random asshole and put him in the highest position at any organization and expect good results.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-30T09:32:11,3
