Ha imagine being dumb enough to believe that.,Denotsyek,2025-04-27T20:28:37,51
A level and flavor of **STUPID** that only breitbart can provide.  Now the orange turd can cure cancer.  Literally _**lol**_ right now.,drtolmn69,2025-04-27T20:28:40,50
This is the biggest load of North Korean-level horseshit I’ve seen on here in quite some time. I am sick and fucking tired of the MAGA cult destroying everything and proclaiming that their God-king can save it.,ParadeSit,2025-04-27T20:28:53,45

"LIES-He is Un funding scientific research, destroying healthcare, and creating poverty, and making prescriptions so expensive no one will have access. He is going the absolute opposite of this - what mf bullshit-President Trump has the historic opportunity to lower drug costs and cure diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and more. He's Making America Healthy Again, by increasing prevention and screening; knocking out the insurance and hospital middlemen that drive up American drug costs; and unleashing the industry to develop new cures.",Potential_Goal6202,2025-04-27T20:30:31,7
"If this is true (it isn't) then fucking do it. If he's the only one who can, and he isn't, then he's even more of a failure than we already know he is. Then it's 100% on trump that he's failing to cure cancer and bring down drug prices. When your family is dying of cancer blame trump, when they can't afford cancer drugs, blame trump. He's the only one who can do it after all, right? And if he's not doing it it's because he doesn't give a flying fuck about you.",OptimusSublime,2025-04-27T20:39:35,7
