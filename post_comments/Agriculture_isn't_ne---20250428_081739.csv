It‚Äôs one thing to have to bail out soy farmers after 1 bad year. Where‚Äôs the money to bail out every single farmer in every sector of agriculture? Also no bailouts for the idiots who voted for this shit.,kat4prez,2025-04-28T08:33:49,10
He doesn't care about you or your farm.  You've been used for your vote.  Period.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-28T08:33:58,8
We are quickly approaching empty store shelves and price increases. This will have a massive financial impact on the middle and lower class. There is going to be a lot of outrage. Buckle up.,greatWrightshark,2025-04-28T08:25:29,7

All the farmers we know in our rural town of Oregon voted for Trump ‚Ä¶,Jomama_one,2025-04-28T08:46:32,6
"American Farmers are about to Find Out¬©Ô∏èwhat happens when you vote for an anti-globalist President whose claim to fame was ""Lock Her Up"" and ""Make America Great Again"". They were shortsighted in how they voted and rather than voting on policy that would ensure stability they voted on deporting migrants and instigating trade wars with our allies. Since they wanted to shit on every single Democratic administration which have done nothing but try and help them, well now they can enjoy kicking rocks like the rest of us. Time to start pulling those bootstraps up hard and who knows, maybe if you pull them up high enough it'll dislodge that stick that's been shoved up their asses since Obama won his first term.",Responsible-Pain-620,2025-04-28T09:32:46,6
444 counties are labelled farm-reliant in America. 433 voted for Trump.,biscuitarse,2025-04-28T09:40:13,3
"They are expecting handouts again.   This happened last Trump presidency and they got big fat welfare checks. So they voted for him again and are hoping for more of the same.   The rest of us suffer, of course. The urge to feel empathy for those who chose this is very limited. But then again, MAGA believes empathy is a sin, so I suppose I should feel not guilt for lacking it in this situation.",MadAstrid,2025-04-28T09:04:19,3

"Sorry fake news Trump clearly stated everyone else will pay and trillions and billions of dollars will come to America, so how can Americans claim that they are suffering. must be something started by Biden or Obama guided by soros !!!",nobackup42,2025-04-28T11:07:54,1

"WE REAP what they sow.  Stop with the schadenfreude, if farmers fail we all starve (and more food control concentrated in fewer hands).",National-Reception53,2025-04-28T08:52:43,5
"Enough with this unhelpful noise. Wall Street got duped, farmers and unions got duped. There was significant money behind making sure that happened. Move on.¬†   (to solutions).",Excellent-Notice2928,2025-04-28T08:41:59,-21
I fear the point is to bankrupt the independent family farms and have them bought out by large corporate farms.  It's the American Way^^TM,KungFuSnafu,2025-04-28T08:52:46,7
"Unfortunately, we're going to HAVE to bail out the idiots who voted for this shit, because they feed us.  Help them or watch our food system collapse.",National-Reception53,2025-04-28T08:53:59,4
"my freezer is ready for cheaper pork üòÖ unfortunately, it comes with shitty stupid friends",vikingdiplomat,2025-04-28T16:19:41,1
"Farmers are the ones that voted for Trump. What, you want to give them handouts so they don't learn the consequences of their actions?  The pork cancellation was a strategic target against red states.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-28T08:23:42,7
They weren‚Äôt duped. They are all in on the hatred and continue to support the hatred.,IRideMoreThanYou,2025-04-28T08:54:23,27
"You can still comment on the willful stupidity. Guzzling anti-intellectualism, doing away with critical thinking, and ignoring facts when presented with them is worthy of comment.  You don't need to stop there and *not* move on to solutions, though.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-28T08:51:36,13
"I think it is unhelpful to say people got duped. The information was out there and a certain group of people made an intentional choice to ignore it. Now they want pity for their plight - a plight they were told would be theirs if they did not make different choices.   Saying ‚ÄúI want racism and I want other people‚Äôs lives to be destroyed, but I don‚Äôt want it to impact me personally, so I will take the risk and vote for destruction and just trust that Trump will ensure I am not among those destroyed, though evidence shows that to be unlikely‚Äù is not being duped by anything but their own craven greed and hate.   As to solutions, well one cannot rebuild a building whilst an arsonist is still burning it down.",MadAstrid,2025-04-28T09:11:40,11
Duped AGAIN you mean.  Like I cant keep cutting them slack for fucking ever just because they are special.,Skraelings,2025-04-28T12:33:59,3
"Depends on the part where they got duped. For the most part, I assume the real crisis is that Trump‚Äôs actions have resulted in semi-permanent damage. This is great for the large corporations that own farms. Notice how the first part of Trump‚Äôs oligarchy is to get the farms first. No food means you can‚Äôt boycott/protest so easily",JollyToby0220,2025-04-28T11:28:11,1
"They knew exactly what was coming. Their ego was just to big to admit it will hit them, too.",soulstormfire,2025-04-28T15:05:14,1
"Plus bailouts for the corporate farmers, the true American way",tegrtyfrm,2025-04-28T09:53:32,3
"And because farms have had such a tough time, these massive factory farms will be forced to raise prices on everything, especially when they‚Äôre forced to buy all those independent farms.",Tumble85,2025-04-28T12:26:08,1
You want us all to starve just to punish Trump voters?  I don't.,National-Reception53,2025-04-28T08:55:24,-3
"Also worthy of comment is the coordinated efforts of just about every for-profit media network in running fear, disinformation of the most insidious nature.   The ability to discern that information isn't readily available to a lot of people‚Äîeither by community bias, age, lack of educational opportunities, so on so forth. Or simply because they'd felt Democrats losing touch with the working class (which they have).    We need those votes and confidences back to have any chance at winning the midterms and reversing course. We don't get them back with shame and holier-than-thou posturing.",Excellent-Notice2928,2025-04-28T08:58:13,3
"also, cut those pesky regulations and inspections...  should be fine... they can police themselves, and the market will correct them if they do bad things!",vikingdiplomat,2025-04-28T16:18:19,2
"To late. The farmers brought fascists to power and as long as they continue to support them, there are FAR worse things coming than starving.",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-04-28T09:31:00,1
"I agree with everything you just said, too.   This is a nuanced issue.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-28T09:00:47,3
"When people start starving, that's when the cannibalism starts, also. Whenever you read ""we did things to survive that we don't talk about"", it's cannibalism.¬†",kami246,2025-04-28T09:37:50,0
