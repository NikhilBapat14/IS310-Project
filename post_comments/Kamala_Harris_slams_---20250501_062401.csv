"Not a topic Democrats need to draw attention to frequently.  The damage done is enough for all to see and point the finger.  Immigration where the administration of the United States is conspiring to commit cruel and inhuman punishment against US citizens.  Lots of guilt to heap on trumpy and crew but the real damages are not yet understood by the general populous.  Explain what is not so obvious, tariffs are so obvious they are not worth the time.",Express_Adeptness_31,2025-05-06T09:32:40,1
