"Don't work with the world to mitigate the effects of climate change.   Instead, tell your base it isn't real even though you absolutely know it is. Fund and develop an ecosystem of disinformation. Then, isolate the country from the rest of the world and then suddenly start threatening the two landmasses available that might provide some final refuge against global warming before they, too, are overcome. Continue the disinformation and assume the religiously committed base will support 19th century conquest in this 21st century setting ""because God Emporer Trump said so."" If climate change isn't real and neither is the theocratic technocracy, then why on Earth would this conversation or the annexation of Canada even be happening?     Many people are saying that the worst people are in charge at the worst moment in history for them to be here. Many people.",vucubcame,2025-05-07T09:11:04,36
