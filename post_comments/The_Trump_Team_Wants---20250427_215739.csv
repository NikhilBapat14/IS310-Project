*Boost white birth rates*,ak4733,2025-04-27T22:05:50,115
"You don't want them surviving to old age fer gosh sakes.   Social Security? Medicare? Nursing Homes? No Way!!  Just to maybe mid-30s, maybe 40s,  then they all start to die off, and after that you haul in a fresh batch of uneducated 8 year olds.",ThistleroseTea,2025-04-27T22:00:23,27
It‚Äôs not really birth rates they‚Äôre after.  As usual their actual goals are far more sinister.  They want women to be glorified sex toys.  They want a culture where a woman‚Äôs highest possible calling in life is being a mother and a subservient wife who will give it to their man whenever he demands it.,Popculturemofo,2025-04-27T22:02:04,34
"They don't want to boost birth rates by making childbirth cheaper/safer, giving extra rebates/tax cuts to new parents, buffing up education services, or giving new home owners incentives...  They want to boost birth rates by **REMOVING** access to birth control/abortion, denying health care, gutting education (including sex education), thus **forcing** the birth rate to rise.",Synli,2025-04-27T22:08:07,21
And give them measles!,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-27T22:56:49,8

"Maybe don‚Äôt crash the economy if you want people to have more kids, that might be a good start.",NoAnnual3259,2025-04-27T22:43:54,5
"I really think their main focus is white babies, who keep reproducing so that when they‚Äôre in outer space then no one can tell them they can‚Äôt have an ethno-state.",rundmz8668,2025-04-27T23:08:47,3

Don't forget the fds not checking milk... listeria cause still births,bobolly,2025-04-27T22:43:08,2
"Trump is so messed up. Have children but don‚Äôt vaccinate them. Children will have no access to due process or higher education financial support, or nutritious meals in public schools or equitable medical care. The only children who will have access to higher education and health care, if survive will be rich kids.",kathryn2a,2025-04-27T22:46:28,2
"The wealthy few want more slave workers to exploit, because if there is a shortage they become too uppity and demand higher wages.",platanthera_ciliaris,2025-04-28T03:14:15,2
"Here‚Äôs a crazy idea to boost birth rates: legalize abortion (again), make health care free, increase the minimum wage to $25 an hour, forgive all current student loan debt and make all state college tuition free, and incentivize the construction of affordable housing.",DrinksandDragons,2025-04-28T06:50:22,3

In a for profit system with limited abortion access sick kids are quite profitable.,Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-04-27T23:26:06,1
That‚Äôs because they want workers that they can control. This is an ideologically eugenicist government more population + pollution = more controllable work force. How else will we afford healthcare?,thapeelllllccc,2025-04-28T00:15:18,1
So they can all get measles?,PlasticTaster,2025-04-28T04:10:08,1

seriously... if we're gonna undercut southeast asia on labor costs we need to start putting six year olds to work.,oldpre,2025-04-28T07:59:15,1
If they poison us early we won‚Äôt live to collect our Social Security and Medicare.¬†,GiftFrosty,2025-04-28T09:14:21,1

Isn‚Äôt this how Morgoth created orcs?,Palimpsest0,2025-04-28T11:54:46,1
"I think the part that's disgusting isn't only the white supremacist bend, but that it begins with aesthetic. Humans are breeding stock to them, from how we're viewed and the traits they want to breed humans for, right down to making us into functionally mistreated livestock.  That's what they regard as greatness: being broiler chickens. Just fat enough to be marketable and used for the right purpose, just pretty enough by their standards to win a ribbon or two. Just, you know, don't try to win if you're a brown-feathered chicken when the judges favour white-feathered chickens.  In the end, the person buying and frying won't care what colour your feathers were when you've been completely and utterly plucked.",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-27T22:37:12,36
"Exactly this, good on you for calling it like it is!",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-27T22:09:45,33
"The pronatalist movement.¬† It's really gross. I can diagree with but at least respect prolifers who are passionate about protecting also nonwhite babies or babies with disabilities. Babies with autism. These guys really put racism above every principle. They don't want to boost birth rates of black, Indigenous, Hispanic or Asian looking people.¬†",Deep-Ad9239,2025-04-27T23:11:33,15

They don't care about that at all. They just want exploitation: lowering the value of a human life.,kiwigate,2025-04-27T23:34:20,5

"I don‚Äôt know what paradigm fits here. Is the goal to have everyone buying stuff, but not with the gov funding- and then when people die from illness they need lots of new babies to buy stuff to replace the dead person‚Äôs spending ‚Ä¶is that the deal?",animalslover4569,2025-04-27T22:04:34,10
It‚Äôs a mix of that and they want slave labor without brown people.,fowlraul,2025-04-27T22:07:29,13

Just make sure when they get sick they die *quickly.* You want to free up that housing stock and not have them taking up any healthcare resources.,specqq,2025-04-27T22:09:37,9
"I‚Äôve heard veiled comments from Trumpers first hand that allude to that very thing. I‚Äôve heard things like the need for ‚ÄúMormon level‚Äù birth rates.  I think some also want that old plantation system back. White, patriarchal with some ‚Äúbrown‚Äù people just low enough on the ladder to be easily exploitable.",raging-peanuts,2025-04-28T04:42:32,7
