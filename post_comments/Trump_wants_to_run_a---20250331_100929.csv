"u/ChangingmynametoJT  You mentioned:  >>*This. He is going to get impeached, if not by his own republicans, then by the landslide democrat replacements that flip the house and senate in 2026. He’s losing a house seat in Florida this Tuesday.*  34x Convicted Felon, Rapist and Twice Impeached Insurrectionist President Trump and his Unelected and (Unapproved by Congress and all American Voters) Co-President Musk (born in South Africa) and their merry band of sycophants are systematically destroying our beautiful Country.   President Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives (at that time ruled by Democrats). That's their job during all information gathering and presentation of the articles of impeachment.  >*In impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives charges an official of the federal government by approving, by simple majority vote, articles of impeachment.*  The Senate hears the evidence and witnesses (they hid / refused to do so the last time).  >*After the House of Representatives sends its articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate sits as a High Court of Impeachment to consider evidence, hear witnesses, and vote to acquit or convict the impeached official. A committee of representatives, called “managers,” act as prosecutors before the Senate. In the case of presidential impeachment trials, the chief justice of the United States presides. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict, and the penalty for an impeached official upon conviction is removal from office. In some cases, the Senate has also disqualified such officials from holding public offices in the future. There is no appeal. Since 1789 about half of Senate impeachment trials have resulted in conviction and removal from office.*  When it came time for a trial?   The Senate (at that time ruled by Republicans) decided not to convict him.  Currently?   The House of Representatives and the Senate are majority ruled by Republicans.  Who will impeach him again?   We need Republicans to join with the Democrats because 2/3 vote of the Senate to convict him.  Republicans will have to join with the Democrats.  IMO?  I don't see that happening.  Previously?  We had tapes (audio and video), threats he made, name calling, bullying, telephone calls, his Twitter and other social media outburts, interviews, black mail attempts, check books, interviews (both journalists and authors) writing articles and books about him (quoting Trump), the insurrectionist behavior and support, etc.  What more is needed?  More than enough so far. He was the only POTUS impeached twice.  And?  The audio and video recordings  of him threatening Ukraine? And the witnesses to his behavior?  The Republican Party supports:  ■ bribes;  ■ fraud;  ■ fear mongering;   ■ fascism;  ■ lies / alternative facts; and  ■ money laundering.  Just because the Senate saw the evidence right in front of them and *voted like they did?*  It doesn't make it right. Or legitimate.  In fact? Right after the Senate vote?

"Thing is, FDR didnt need the war to justify it - it wasnt a rule or a law, it was a tradition based precedent. In fact, the US wasnt even involved in the war yet when FDR won his third term, the US didnt enter the war until almost a full year after his third term started.   Any previous president could have sought another term, they just didnt because they chose not to based on that tradition (or in the case of Grant and Teddy Roosevelt, bowed out to public backlash from the opposition). FDR outmanouvered the opposition to avoid backlash through some shrewd politicking at the DNC so that he was ""drafted"" to run for the third term by the party, rather than declaring that he was going to seek the third term himself.  The situation is different for Trump, as theres a Constitutional amendment directly preventing him from running again, and another which keeps him from being back-doored into it via being nominated as Vice President. Barring something insidious or complex like becoming Speaker of the House and having Pres/VP step down so he can reassume office, theres no real way for him to have a third term.

Said Progressive split was basically the beginning of the dance of Red Rover that played out over the next sixty years or so as the parties swapped constituencies group-by-group, which can be briefly summarized as FDR’s New Deal pulled the progressives into the Democrats, LBJ’s Civil Rights Act drove the reactionaries out of the Democrats, and Nixon’s Southern Strategy pulled the reactionaries into the Republicans.",ThePowerOfStories,2025-03-31T19:51:09,8
