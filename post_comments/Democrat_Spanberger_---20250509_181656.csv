"Spanberger's got to have some of the worst advisors ever when it comes to messaging.  To the average American, ""Reform"" has just been a euphemism for ""I ain't doing jack squat"" for a couple decades now.  Being a Democrat should mean backing unions, full stop. It shouldn't be that hard.",pierre_x10,2025-05-09T21:00:04,6
This is one reason Democrats suck.  They are not able to figure out how to represent working people.  They are ineffectual at it at best! They lose working folks vote to republicans who actively want to hurt working people.  Republicans are irredeemably lost.   Democrats are the “lesser evil” party but can’t seem to be for working unions and against genocide.  Fucking losers.,Bitter-Holiday1311,2025-05-09T18:28:51,10

"I lived 5 years in VA, and even in the peak Obama years the state Democrats could barely hold it together. George Allen was doing WW2-era slurs and still lost by a termite's hair.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-09T18:35:00,4
"It's Virginia what do you expect? As you complain about Democrats generally based on the words of one person, specifically, here's an article for you: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/michigan-becomes-1st-state-in-decades-to-repeal-right-to-work-law  By lumping everyone together you undermine all those who are trying to make a difference including all the reps who had to work to get the bill to the governor's pen in the first place. Unless, of course, undermining them is your goal...",Grandpa_No,2025-05-09T18:32:46,4
"Good for Michigan.  21 states to go.  As great news as that is, Democrats are so shitty they couldn’t carry MI.  So…",Bitter-Holiday1311,2025-05-09T18:40:25,2
