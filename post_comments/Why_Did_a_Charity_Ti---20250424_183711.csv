"TL;DR  Florida's largest Medicaid contractor, Centene, had overbilled taxpayers more than $67 million for medications. When they were caught, they were told to give the money back to the Florida government. At this point, Ol' Ronnie here said to divert $10 million to 2 charities (one is run by his wife). The scandal begins when neither of the 2 charities are required to report how they spend their money...and then it was found that the 2 charities donated $8.5 million donation to Ron's Super-PAC.  Looks like Ron's looking to run for POTUS again.",exophrine,2025-04-24T22:39:55,5

Hey NY Times... Welcome to the rest of the world. We all fucking knew this was going on. The money was then used to fight (and win against) the ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana use. Fucking Mafia state.,williamgman,2025-04-24T19:05:31,5

"They'll deny it. We will yell. By the time the minority party can start to spin the wheels of combatting it or resisting their illegal actions with legal, slow measures, MAGA is onto it's next red line crossed.
