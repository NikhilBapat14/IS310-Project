"trump's appointment to head the Naval Academy is a major scandal that flies under the radar due to all of the other noise. He appointed his ""bag man,"" who previously carried around his luggage and ran errands, to lead the academy. Walt Nauta also helped trump steal classified documents in that infamous case, bringing the documents to Mar a Lago. He's vastly unqualified for the role, another trump appointment that seeks to sabotage the institution instead of leading it.  For those unaware, the Naval Academy is a very prestigious institution which trains future naval officers. trump putting his bag man in charge is a massive insult to the heritage of the US Navy, and doesn't bode well for the Navy's future leaders.  Nauta has also been charged with sexual assault allegations. Another one of trump's very fine people.",charcoalist,2025-04-23T13:57:37,9

"There is a new lecture, though - ""Feigned testosterone: Theory and Practice. Finding balance between personal inadequacies, idealized machismo as performative art, and navigating through bluster in a big, scary world."" The lecture will be given by none other than Pete Hegseth, while he's still here, with an introductory pep talk by Markwayne Mullin about picking fights.   Refreshments will be served in the Dana White UFC faculty lounge - Red Bull, red meat, and cheesy puffs.",steve_ample,2025-04-23T13:57:28,4
