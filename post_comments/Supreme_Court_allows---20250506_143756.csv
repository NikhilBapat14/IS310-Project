"What a fucking joke.  ""The lead plaintiff in the case, Commander Emily Shilling, has been a naval aviator for nearly two decades, and she estimates that the Navy has spent $20 million on her training.""  So she's been an aviator for 20 years and has $20 mil and were supposed to what throw that out the window? For fuck sake, she proved she can do it. Just let people be! Fuck they have me arguing *for* the military, a machine I see as spitting out mostly nothing but radicalism and untreated PTSD. I wouldn't argue anyone should go do that if those are the likely outcomes, but by Jesus Christ LET THEM IF THEY WANT!",Familiar-Report-513,2025-05-06T15:04:28,12

Trans people should be creating and joining leftist militias not the American Empires fascist armed forces.,Rational_Defiance,2025-05-06T15:17:23,2
Misleading title   Apparently they haven't ruled on the topic as a whole and are waiting for the 9th circuit to finish its review and probably be appealed?¬†   But they did remove an order that stopped the Trump admin from kicking out and discriminating against trans military personnel while the issue is being battled in courts so it certainly doesn't seem to bode well once the appeal reaches the SC,blues111,2025-05-06T15:00:49,2
It‚Äôs a dumb rule to be applied so broadly and the Supreme Court are cowards but the military has traditionally been given broad latitude with respect to suitability for service.,yuanshaosvassal,2025-05-06T14:47:29,2

does this mean the next president can ban cis people from the military?,angy_loaf,2025-05-06T15:32:28,1
The Super Court is the political wing of the MAGA movement. MAGA president has unlimited power and authority. Democrat presidents have no power and no authority. They are a fucking disgrace and a fucking joke. Fuck them.,Huckleberry199,2025-05-06T15:54:15,1
