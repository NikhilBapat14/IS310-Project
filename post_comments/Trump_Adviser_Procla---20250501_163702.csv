"“The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility, but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war.”  - Sydney J.

"The current administration's war on education is undeniably reminiscent of how fascist regimes of the past have attempted to subvert the education system, attack the arts and intellectuals, and suppress opposing voices and viewpoints   But don't take it from me...  Jason Stanley, author of *""How Fascism Works,""* and *""Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future""* argues:  > Fascist politics attacks education to undermine democracy and pluralism. Universities and educational institutions are targeted because they promote critical inquiry when challenging the myths that fascist politics rely on   Stanley describes how anti-intellectualism is used to:  > attack the media, universities, and scientists when they contradict the strong man’s authority.  The MAGA movement embraces anti-intellectualism as a means to not only dismiss the legitimacy of the educated, experts, scientists and the media, but also to assert their superiority and the primacy of their beliefs.   The Trump administration has identified universities and public schools as places where ""radical left"" ideas and antithetical perspectives are taught. This becomes a justification for the use of draconian policies and executive orders that allow the government to take control over all academic decision making.  Robert Paxton, author of ""*Anatomy of Fascism*,"" explains the behavior of fascists:  > Fascism seeks to control education to instill its ideology in the youth, ensuring that future generations are loyal to the regime and its values.  > By reshaping educational curricula, fascist regimes aim to eliminate critical thinking and promote a narrative that supports their authoritarian rule.  Paxton also says that fascists value *""the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason""*  This is what the Trump administration is hoping to accomplish by strong-arming universities, by fracturing the education system, by restructuring the curriculum and by overhauling programs and departments that don't promote administration-approved viewpoints.  This serves to stifle critical thinking and program younger generations to accept the leader's words and the party's dogma over everything else.  Additionally, the Trump administration's efforts to defund and dismantle the public education system will disproportionately impact underserved communities, which is a feature, not a bug.  There's also Lawrence Britt, who published *""Fascism Anyone?""*, which includes a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. One characteristic is the ""*disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts:*""  > Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  MAGA is openly hostile towards public education, higher learning, academics and teachers, scientists and researchers, even towards the arts.  The federal government has been pressuring schools and universities into firing its administrators.   The current administration is targeting student protestors, is unlawfully detaining students and faculty who have been critical of the administration's policies, all while demanding that universities report on foreign students and their affairs.  We've seen violent threats issued towards educators, staff members and even school librarians.  The government is demanding that schools hand over their admissions data so that the Trump administration can dictate who qualifies for admission and who does not. They're also demanding that universities supply their employment data so the government can oversee hiring and firing and determine who meets the approved criteria.   The government is even putting certain departments under the supervision of outside security forces (literal thought police)  The Trump administration is also slashing funding for scientific research and grants. This will impact progress on cancer research and research on infectious diseases. It will also hinder the development of future generations of scientists.  Luis Britto García defines fascism in his essay *""Fascismo.""* One of the characteristics of fascism, Garcia says, is how ""fascism is anti-intellectual:""  > Noting the scientific progress achieved by progressivism, Britto Garcia writes ""Fascism does not invent, it recycles. It only believes in yesterday, an imaginary yesterday that never existed.""  This concept is instilled into the MAGA consciousness. ""Scientific progress"" becomes negatively associated with ""the left."" Trump and his supporters constantly challenge widely agreed upon consensus while denying science. They even believe that their backwards, antiquated views about science, medicine, biology, etc, are more valid than the relevant and leading scientific research.  Eden McLean, historian of fascism, notes that fascists historically put their efforts into controlling information:  > Restricting access to information and promoting conformity over critical thinking are tactics reminiscent of fascist regimes.   The Trump administration is already instituting policies that flag thousands of images, articles, online content, historical texts and even words for removal. They are suppressing free speech, attacking the press, and controlling what information is being disseminated to the public.  Ruth Ben-Ghiat, historian and author of *""Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,""* notes that:  > Mussolini and Hitler both restructured educational systems to promote their authoritarian ideologies and suppress dissent  The goal for fascist regimes is to shape the ideologies of followers and future generations, suppressing any antithetical ideas and perspectives while promoting nationalistic and nativist doctrine.  In this sense, teaching ""patriotism"" amounts to radicalizing the population and instilling a set of ""values"" and beliefs that correspond with the regime's authoritarian, ethnocentric and chauvinistic disciplines.  When forced to acknowledge these parallels, those on the far right will often try to accuse the opposition of pursuing these same tactics.  For fascists and their followers, they're the *real* victims of oppression. They're merely reacting to a system of tyranny that's suffocating *them*. Equality amounts to persecution, addressing past injustices amounts to an assault on *their* rights and freedoms.  They fail to acknowledge historic inequities and perceive things like fairness, diversity and even impartiality as threats to a long-established hierarchy.  Contrary to what they believe, their insistence that they are the victims of a new system of oppression is, ironically, a consequence of them living within an inequitable system for so long, and a system that has predisposed them to believe that they are victims.  These fascist and authoritarian movements propagandize their followers and persuade them to adopt an ""us vs. them"" mentality. Fascist leaders tend to rely on culture wars and a method of identifying dangerous ideas, scapegoats and enemies that act as common threats for their followers to unite against. These ""others,"" these ""them"" represent an existential danger to their core beliefs, their culture, their way of life, their country, their very existence, and in this case, their white, Christian hegemony.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-01T19:20:35,1

Love what exactly? We don’t help out those in any type of need. We only seem to bail out the wealthy and farmers and practically no one else when times get tough. We haven’t won a war since 1945 despite most of our tax dollars going to the military for their wildly overinflated budget. We are currently shipping us citizens to another country’s prison camps without due process. We have more mass shootings and school shootings than anywhere else in the world. We haven’t properly funded schools since the 60’s. Schools are literally falling apart and are often the worst/oldest buildings in their communities.

A  nationalist loves the country without criticism and becomes dangerous. I famous guy I think he was the 16th president of this country said that “a house divided against itself, cannot stand”. My ancestors were enslaved in this land and fought to improve this country, I refuse to throw away their sacrifice.  We need to teach people to honor the legacy of people that ended slavery, bought civil rights to everyone and reached for the moon. We need Americans to believe this country can be a force for good. Not that it is an unredeemable project that needs to be destroyed.

"I feel like “we were headed in the right direction in the main” carried a lot of 80s-90s kid patriotism. Your high school education might have dwelled on the good parts more than the bad, but it also acknowledged that there were bad things that the good things helped fix—like, your MLK unit definitely was like “Jim crow was the literal worst, and we got better. Still work to do, but we started down the path.”—and then you’d see that reflected in the news: Obama becomes president. There are cases of racism vigorously prosecuted now. You just don’t say some things to some people.  I feel like the first part is still a fair, if tilted towards the home team as good guys teaching of American history, up to and including Trump 1 and Biden. As you note, it’s a lot harder to see in Trump 2.  Still, from an anti-patriotic point of view—I think there *is* something to be said about collegiate level courses tilting too far towards America bashing—that the white man was an evil oppressor, and that is the only narrative. That is not even giving the home team the advantage it deserves—like, the segregation of troops in WWII is bad and unfair, but also, the normal ass white dude’s bravery also deserves a fair bit of coverage. That balancing act is something collegiate level studies don’t do well.  Which is still to say that propagandizing kids, and not teaching that Jim Crow, the failure of Reconstruction, and Andrew Jackson’s crimes against Native Americans exist is good. But those things can be put in context of the long arc of American history without making the sins the only focal point.",kanakaishou,2025-05-02T10:09:20,1
