It's cute that they are under the assumption that Trump's government will bail them out just like Obama did.,[deleted],2025-05-02T17:07:36,24

I don't know- I'm holding out on buying a car because a big $ purchase seems like a bad idea with all this chaos and uncertainty.  I can't be the only one.,GuyMakesDrawings,2025-05-02T17:20:24,7
Maybe we‚Äôre reading the situation wrong and they‚Äôre welcoming because if they can barely get any car parts they don‚Äôt have to do anything.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T17:04:39,3

"When you don‚Äôt pay attention to technology. If anything that has to do with manufacturing? It‚Äôs going to be automation. That‚Äôs the only way to beat the price of employment. No sick days, no benefits, and it‚Äôs a one time investment. I went on a cruise and it had an automated bartender. The thing that pissed me off was I had to tip said robot!",nopulsehere,2025-05-02T17:09:57,2

"Well, I'll be interested to see what ""Auto Workers"" have say, once those tariffs (which, incidentally, only go into effect today - 5/3) filter down into their workplace supply chains. ""No Matter What‚Äôs Happening on Wall Street"" - better buckle up for when the effects hit the ""Motor Mile.""",phosdick,2025-05-03T08:52:39,1
This is what they've always wanted: an end to globalization and forcing America to become a manufacturing hub again. This is really what the working class has wanted for decades and why Trump has been so successful winning them over. Dems need to pay attention and adjust accordingly to win back these voters in states like Michigan.,Scarlettail,2025-05-02T17:15:39,-8
"I believe Obama actually made us money on the loan he gave them, but trump is too stupid to construct such a financial transaction so he would hand out some free money if someone slides it across the resolute to sign with a diet coke",stjohns_jester,2025-05-02T17:18:32,3
Trump bailed out the farmers in his first term. These people assume Trump will rob someone to do it again because he cares about them. They won‚Äôt realize he doesn‚Äôt until they experience the hardships and no help ever comes.,Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-02T17:18:42,2

"Me too. I actually am offloading my 'expensive' car and bought a cheaper vehicle that is simple and easy to fix to get me through the next \~4 years.  I was ready to buy a new EV6 on the year end lease deals, but didn't want to have to buy a new car in 2ish years because who knows what the atmosphere will be then. I also decided not to buy a new-to-me boat this year and stick with my older one. And I was condo shopping in a HCOL area, but I'm going to keep renting because if I lose my job, at least I can just pay a penalty and walk away without a foreclosure.   These are supposed to be the most successful years of my life, but I am pulling back my spending and planning. Insane times.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-05-02T17:32:08,4

Oh please they are delusional and just as likely to get burnt like they did in 2008 when we had a businessman as a president. They are going to look foolish when Americans cannot afford the vehicles they are making .,Express_Resource_415,2025-05-02T17:34:56,3
"I'm not sure if you're aware or not, but in no world is the US going to become a hub for manufacturing again.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-05-02T17:38:51,5
"It may very well be what workers want, but it's not going to happen. At least not at wages they will be satisfied with.  We can't compete internationally with China. They have a billion people that will take jobs at extremely low wages. So they are going to beat us on prices every time. And our products aren't really that great. Go look at consumer reports and the cars with the worst reliability are American made.  If we moved all manufacturing back to the US, things like the iphone would cost $3,000.  We can't be that manufacturing hub. There is no market for our products at prices other countries will pay, at wages Americans would be happy with.",InsideAside885,2025-05-02T18:21:56,2
Farmers aren't wising up.  They lined up to vote Red even after tRump oversaw the largest loss of family owned farms in decades.  Even after all the bailouts and lost revenue they'll still vote red next election too.,Richfor3,2025-05-02T19:39:10,3
"> Farmers are already starting to wise up - in fact iirc they were the first group to turn.  They are upset that they are getting hurt. Once the Republicans give them a couple of subsidies, they will all go back to voting Republican. Just you wait and see.",xibeno9261,2025-05-02T21:34:29,3
It doesn't matter whether they're delusional. We kind of need their votes.,Scarlettail,2025-05-02T17:40:21,0
Biden did actually help boost manufacturing some under his term. Maybe the biggest hub but it's possible to bolster it quite a bit at least.,Scarlettail,2025-05-02T17:41:17,-1

"Okay, you're using terms like ""boost"" and ""bolster"", which are a far cry from becoming a ""hub"". I agree, to a certain extent, that there is definitely opportunity to onshore key industries, but the rest is an absolute pipe dream. We are a consumption economy that exports knowledge and tech, not hard goods. We are rich, we consume.   Okay, say your pipe dream of US manufacturing becomes a reality. Where are the raw materials coming from? US as well? Who is the consumer that is going to pay *that* price? You realize the manufacturing that comes back will be automated, and won't magically create this powerful middle class like after the war(that was built on liberal policies, I might add...which obviously won't exist now), right?",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-05-02T17:45:56,1
