"Excerpt:   *MANCHESTER, N.H. — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told New Hampshire Democrats to “stop apologizing” and “stop surrendering” as the party battles the Trump administration, blaming a “culture of timidity” for its losses last year.*  *“We will never join so many Republicans in the special place in hell reserved for quislings and cowards,” Pritzker said at the party’s annual McIntyre-Shaheen fundraising dinner here. “We will relegate their portraits to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors.”*  *“They spent years watching Republicans illegitimately pack the Supreme Court, take away voting rights from people of color, systematically chip away at the constitutional order,” he said. “Those same do-nothing Democrats want to blame our losses on our defense of Black people and trans kids and immigrants, instead of their own lack of guts and gumption.”*  *“We just finished a presidential election,” Pritzker told Semafor before the dinner. “Could we take a breath and talk about the congressional elections coming up in 2026?” He was in Manchester, he said, because it was an “opportunity to talk about what’s happening in the country right now and what Democrats need to be doing to stand up and fight back.”*  *“Oligarchy is a group of the most powerful people in society who are trying to impose their will on everyone else, and make them pay for what the oligarchs are unwilling to pay for,” said Pritzker. “There’s a big difference between the people that Bernie Sanders is talking about and what I believe in.” He was opposing Trump’s agenda of “the largest tax increase, with the tariffs on working-class people, and the largest tax cut for wealthy people. That is exactly the opposite of what people thought they were voting for in November.”*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-28T09:33:51,3
This is how dems should approach this. The party of Pelosi and Schumer are over.,williamgman,2025-04-28T09:38:54,3
> It’s wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law.  The fact that this needs to be said and that it's a statement that Republicans do not agree with is totally insane...,AussieJeffProbst,2025-04-28T10:00:36,2

If he is the candidate it’s gonna be curious how the anti billionaires message will work with him in charge. Maybe it works but there’s a good chance it backfires after all:  no more billionaires in politics except pritzker he’s a good guy. Like maybe it works maybe it doesn’t. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-28T09:38:21,2
"I think there’s a bit of a difference between a “no billionaires” and a “no oligarchs” message. People from Illinois have a pretty good sense that he’s trying to act in their best interests rather than his own business interests. But you’re right, that may be a tough sell to some progressives.",CroweMorningstar,2025-04-28T12:14:02,2

"What were Jeff Bezos's actions before buying the Washington Post that made anyone believe things would be fine? At the point he bought the Washington Post, it was pretty well known that he was unethical from the actions of Amazon eating small businesses in the U.S. Meanwhile, Pritzker ended cash bail, passed a $15 minimum wage, talks about empathy and compassion, defends the weak, etc.  I'm not sure these are comparable situations.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-28T10:01:07,0
