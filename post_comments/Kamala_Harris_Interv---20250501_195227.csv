"It's easy to see why Trump pissed off and accused deceptive editing.    We know he's got pre determined question from Fox News, even then he's completely coming off unprepared, even the editing didn't help him.    He knows he looks bad, even on Fox News.   So when Kamala interviews came out and it looks goods, he simply didn't believe it.   It's always a projection with this guy.   Just like loser student who cheat in the exam, instead of admitting and learning from his mistakes, he blame it on something else.",YJSubs,2025-05-02T01:38:46,19

"Thing is though, even assuming their edit *was* deceptive (it wasn't), cases need damages. What damage can his lawyers argue, that he could have double won the election had this interview been edited how *he thinks* it should have? That's worth $20,000,000,000 in damages?  As well, assuming a wacky world where they actually succeeded, they've then set the legal precedent that news stations can be sued for multiple billions for having a perceived bias - that's pretty much lights-out for every news station, especially Fox, OANN, etc.  I think it's just a legal shakedown, and I don't think they're trying to build the case up cause it doesn't have any merit to begin with.",VonSkullenheim,2025-05-02T05:44:08,1

"It's not a nod to him, though.  The interview *is* edited.  Nobody is claiming that it isn't.  Trump is claiming that it was edited in a way to promote Harris.  60 Minutes says it wasn't, and released the unedited version to prove it.  I also don't think it's a middle finger to him (unless it's the ""nominated for an Emmy"" part).  It's just that the interview was edited, and so it has to go in the ""edited interview"" category.  I don't see how it's deeper than that.",strangr_legnd_martyr,2025-05-02T14:16:26,2

You should spice up your comprehension skills. Your own quote says it's an ironic twist **recognizing** the editing as a good one. A good edit of an interview is an edit that conveys the truth not a lie.  That is the almost unanimous reading of the action taken by Emmys from almost all news reporting stations except for  Fox News.,brakeline,2025-05-02T11:14:17,1
