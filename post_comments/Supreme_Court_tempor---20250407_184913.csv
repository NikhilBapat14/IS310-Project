"Is SCOTUS now signaling further subjugation by the executive branch?  After witnessing the maga-controlled surrender of the congressional branch, are we now looking at the end of 3 co-equal branches of government and by extention the end of checks and balances in our government?  I fear this is a harbinger to the end of the rule of law in America.",BoutrosBoutrosDoggy,2025-04-07T18:56:01,1
Absolutely shameful.,shadmere,2025-04-07T18:50:56,1
Fuck this court. Funny how much due process is involved when it comes to brining him home when there is a glaring lack of due process sending him there.   There is just as much evidence that Pam Bondi is a gang member as he is. She should be deported to this same prison and not release until each and every one of those sent there has had their day in court.,ObiWanChronobi,2025-04-07T18:54:25,1

Supreme Court showing clear-as-day fealty to the executive office over something extremely suspect…truly very unique times.  On a completely unrelated note the first two seasons of Handmaid's Tale truly is must-watch TV.,limaconnect77,2025-04-07T19:21:08,1
"the governments argument that ""they should absolutely"" receive judicial review is such UTTER FUCKING HORSESHIT when they already sent multiple planeloads out of the fucking country, they've already demonstrated with the Maryland mans case that they are incapable of doing this without administrative mistakes, let alone actual process mistakes, and that they are apparently either incapable or UNWILLING to get them back when they fuck the pooch.  let the administration lock them up if you really don't wanna block the AEA yet, but goddammit, leave the ban on shipping them to a random country they aren't even from until their cases have been heard. are our prisons really so full of holes that these people would escape from them? are our wardens incapable of keeping them from killing other prisoners (because I know that's your next argument)? if so, then our entire prison system is a joke (well, it already is, but for other reasons).  FUCK THIS ADMINISTRATION. goddamn.",Red49er,2025-04-07T19:07:05,1
The gov shopping for jurisdiction now received the  greenlight. They kidnap folks move them around and deny their lawyers info then force the case to happen in far states from where the folks were picked up. This all infringed on these people due process. ,nkassis,2025-04-07T19:21:56,1

"""History is no stranger to such lawless regimes, but this Nation's system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise."" - Sotomayor's dissent (pg8)  Everyone should go and read this case. The majority ignores the government's actions to subvert the courts as well as numerous disturbing circumstances surrounding the case in their decision.

"Yes.   Today, Trump said that he wants to be able to (also) send American citizens to those prisons in other countries. This was always least up to this.   https://youtu.be/j7CpBnVM1GQ?si=Y-Ek4JXT5K6l8aHI",slammy80,2025-04-07T19:22:10,1
