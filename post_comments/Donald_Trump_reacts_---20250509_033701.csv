"It should have been me, it could have been me it would have been me, but I turned them down. They said Sir you are the best example of what it means to be a contradiction in terms. I thanked them for that and told them that I was honored they would say those words but I'm so busy with the tariffs and watching Fox news, Breitbart, Newsmax, and all the other fantastic best media outlets that I couldn't be the Pope.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T04:17:04,6
"By Andrew Stanton , Sonam Sheth and Gabe Whisnant - Weekend Staff Writer:   President Donald Trump reacted Thursday after the Vatican announced the selection of a new pope.  ""I saw the smoke, but I haven't seen the pope,"" Trump said on his way out of a White House event with military mothers.

I have noticed several stories of Trump not knowing of decisions and actions made by his underlings .Is this to shield him from blame when things go wrong.,Spare_Dig_7959,2025-05-09T05:21:19,2

"I spent most of the hour between the smoke and the appearance scanning the crowd for a MAGA hat and did not see ONE! LOL!!! Oh, that will eat at his highness, for sure!  But US news had to play that clip of the choo choo train of obese obnoxious US supporters screaming, ""USA USA!"" So utterly embarrassing.  And a bystander pointed out he is not the first ""American"" pope, because Francis came from South America.  The US is literally ""The United States of (the Americas)""  So to be accurate, the news should be reporting that he is the first Pope ""born in the United States"".   One positive thing for me, it makes renaming the Gulf a bit easier to swallow, if they would just add an ""S"" :  ""The Gulf of the Americas""",Individual-Guest-123,2025-05-09T07:28:35,1
