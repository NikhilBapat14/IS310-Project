Man! Thank god they're catching and deporting those criminal illegal-party goers. /s,the_cla,2025-04-28T04:34:36,1

"Supposedly they found plenty of guns and drugs, dea was involved and the quantity seems more than what was just on the pockets of a few party goers: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/us/colorado-springs-ice-raid-club  Not to mention active duty service men facilitating the operation.  This isn’t something dems should fight in my opinion. Not when we got actual citizens being deported with their family members. If the reporting on this is accurate this IS what ICE should be doing rather than ambushing people in court who are doing routine immigration procedures. And I know people here say “you believe the administration?” No. But none of the press is disputing this and they actually are pretty quick to do so.",TelevisionExpress616,2025-04-28T08:58:03,1

"If you notice the News article doesn’t seem to be balanced. Whereas 100 people were said to be in the country illegally, that maybe those people were unable to provide citizenship papers. I am a 74 year old native and I would be unable to provide proof of citizenship if caught in a sweep. All I normally have is a driver’s license and debit cards. Later in the article does it mention there were 214 in the club, it doesn’t mention what happened to them or the alleged crimes or criminals. It’s also curious that they say “authorities documented drug trafficking, prostitution, and the presence of alleged members from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, MS-13, and the Hells Angels.” However Pullin says they don’t know if any were present. So good publicity for Law Enforcement and DEA but yet to see if any arrests come of it and how many people are deported.",johnn48,2025-04-28T15:25:33,1
