"From the article:     Federal judges ruled Thursday that Alabama intentionally discriminated against Black residents when the state disobeyed court orders to draw a second Black-majority congressional district.   A three-judge panel said the congressional map drawn by the 2023 Alabama Legislature violated the Voting Rights Act. The judges, which ruled against the state twice before and put a new map in place for last year’s elections, have permanently blocked Alabama from using the state-drawn map.    The judges said the court does not “diminish the substantial improvements Alabama has made in its official treatment of Black Alabamians in recent decades.  “Yet we cannot reconcile the State’s intentional decision to discriminate in drawing its congressional districts with its position that Alabama has finally closed out its repugnant history of official discrimination involving voting rights,” they added.   The court will now consider whether to place Alabama under Provision 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which would require the state to get federal approval of its congressional plans.",kootles10,2025-05-09T11:56:40,11
"After being told twice to create a fair congressional map, they doubled down on the same discriminatory lines. But hey, third time's the charm, right? Maybe next they'll try drawing districts with invisible ink to keep things interesting.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T12:13:40,5

They will just try to do it again.  Guaranteed they will try to skip over voters that they view as opposition to their cause. ,arilupe,2025-05-09T12:19:48,1
