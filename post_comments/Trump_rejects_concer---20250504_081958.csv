"Trump rejects truth, always has.",Imhungorny,2025-05-04T08:23:07,17
It’s crazy how much his so called approval rating sliding has affected him so much. He’s definitely losing his mind over it and it’s causing him to say and do some absolutely unhinged things. If I was naive this would look like a death spiral of someone in a manic episode. Clearly Trump has become an expert of the tail spin and fucking thrives in it?,Desperate_Story7561,2025-05-04T08:25:42,10

"Billionaires don't care about small businesses, farmers, EMTs, teachers, or the working class and/or poor people in general so fuck them and their complaints (this is their attitude).  Billionaires just don't want people pushing them about paying their fair share of taxes.  Notice how things spiraled once that conversation was getting bigger.  Notice how suddenly they made this DEI stink bigger to distract from the real issues.  Government being bribed by Billionaires (as funding).  So many other obviously corrupt things being done becoming a front issue, they had to do something to turn people's attention elsewhere and make their corruption acceptable. ",arilupe,2025-05-04T08:31:40,8

"Prices? As a disabled senior citizen, I'm just as concerned about Social Security, Medicare and multiple other social safety nets. Homelessness on the rise and militarized police forces everywhere. This is not going to end well.",jarchack,2025-05-04T08:39:59,5

He also dismissed small businesses. Every headline leaves that out.,turb0_encapsulator,2025-05-04T12:21:19,2
"guess he doesnt care about his republician buddies, maga, or his billionaire pals and putin after all does he",saiyanscaris,2025-05-04T10:56:21,1
"trump is so ignorant about normal everyday people. I don’t know anyone who buys their kids 30 dolls for Christmas or buying them 250 pencils in a single purpose. In fact where I live, for the past few years, during the summer they have been asking for donations for backpacks and school supplies for all the kids who’s parents can’t afford to purchase them, which includes a few pencils (not 250).",No_Pressure_1289,2025-05-04T11:16:27,1

Wait till US stock of products dwindle. He's gonna to completely nutso.,FlyingRock,2025-05-04T08:29:08,10
It's probably cognitive dissonance because I'm sure he's convinced that everyone in the world thinks and believes the same way he does. He's a malignant narcissist that keeps himself surrounded by yes-men.  I would expect nothing less.,jarchack,2025-05-04T08:35:54,7
"I think you are right.  But how much pointless suffering first, is the question.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-04T12:15:07,1
He grew up rich lol.  His reality is not our reality.  I'm all for a president that didn't grow up with Trump wealth and this kind of disconnect from real Americans lives.  ,arilupe,2025-05-04T08:38:50,4
