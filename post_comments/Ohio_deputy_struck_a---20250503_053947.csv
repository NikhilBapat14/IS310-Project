The suspects jumped out and took off running.  >Within the matter of six seconds, the chief said the lives of everyone involved changed.  One officer ran after one suspect, while the other officer pursued another suspect.  One of the suspects, who is only being identified as John Doe, had a semiautomatic handgun, according to video Chief Theetge showed the media.  >The suspect pointed the gun, which had an extended magazine, at the officer, who then fired his weapon, the chief said.  Despite officers‚Äô attempts to save the suspect‚Äôs life, Chief Theetge says he died. Police have not been able to 100% identify the deceased suspect, thus, he is John Doe for now.  >Two other suspects, an [18-year-old¬†and a 19-year-old](https://www.fox19.com/2025/05/02/fatal-police-involved-shooting-2-suspects-arrested-scene-head-court-friday/), were taken into custody following a ‚Äúlengthy pursuit,‚Äù the chief explained.  They were both charged with one count each of obstructing official business and receiving stolen property, according to their criminal complaints.  >A fourth suspect remains on the run, she added.  >Police have not released a description of the fourth suspect yet.¬†  So this just-retired officer was murdered because the ""father"" of this piece of shit human being (who is probably a repeat criminal) stole a car, fled on foot and pointed a gun at a cop?  He somehow couldn't comprehend the fact that the cop was defending himself from his son?!?   Where was this so-called ""father"" when it came to raising his kid right?  Nowhere to be found, I'm sure.  But when it came time to being morally outraged that his son played FAFO one too many times and paid the price?  He's all in for that.  And what the news articles aren't stressing enough here is that the police officer this guy deliberately drove over with his SUV *wasn't the cop who killed his son!!*    He didn't even work for the same police department!  The officer who shot and killed his son works for the Cincinnati Police Department while the officer he rammed with his SUV was a just-retired Deputy who worked for the Hamilton County Sheriff Department.  He was just a random cop helping with traffic control at a college graduation commencement ceremony. This man lost his life for absolutely no other reason than he was wearing a police uniform.  If he's convicted of murder, I sincerely hope he becomes inmate #26 on Kentucky's death row.  This is fucking crazy.   We need to start coming down HARD on dangerous, violent and repeat criminals.   And now that the people in charge *aren't* the ones who feel sorrier for the criminals than their victims, maybe we can finally start locking up these people where they belong.",MildlyBemused,2025-05-03T14:04:46,53
"When I first read the headline, I thought the murdered deputy was the one who shot the teen. To learn he had nothing to do with it just left me shaking my head. Prayers to the family of the slain officer.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-03T07:21:33,73
"Very sad. The media narrative around cops has brainwashed the worst among us. Instead of taking accountability for being a failed parent, you blame the cops.  It also doesnt help that the media/left promote the destruction of traditional family values, prioritizing absolute nonsense and ignoring whats best for children",Cblan1224,2025-05-03T06:14:06,17

"Sounds like premeditated murder of a cop. Hopefully this case gets picked up by the new invigorated DOJ and the defendant will be facing the death penalty instead of some slap on the wrist.   The deputy was retired and was still working as a special deputy, doing stuff like traffic control and working big events, because he wanted to continue to help his community and this scumbag father targeted him for killing because a completely different cop killed the scumbag dad's scumbag son.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-03T10:32:22,44

The thing that is really messed up is the deputy is retired and was working special detail doing traffic for the UC commencement ceremony,Electrical_Iron_1161,2025-05-03T12:32:10,4

"Well, lawmakers are empowering the criminals and the cops. For every instance of some legitimate crime against a cop. We see one of a cops legitimate crime against a citizen(look at the lady and her dog that were shot, after calling the cops for help).   Look at states that have restrictive gun laws. Those laws, do not effect criminals, obviously. And LEOs are exempt.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-04T17:23:08,1
