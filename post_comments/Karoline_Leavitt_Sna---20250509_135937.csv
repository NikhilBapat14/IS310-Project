"So, you want to talk about Donald Trump and his family. But it was okay for Joe Biden, his brother,and his porn loving, drug addicted son, Hunter to illegally make several million selling influence and no telling what else to our enemies; China, Russia, Ukraine and Romania (all of this was recorded on Hunter Biden laptops and validated as authentic). So what if Donald Trump goes golfing. Joe Biden took more vacation days than days he spent in the office or working. He illegally took Confidential Documents when he was Senator (only Presidents have this authority) and kept them for years in his garage unsecured. Took showers with his teen daughter (she documented this in her diary). Loves kissing and rubbing little girls. Perhaps you just can’t stand the fact that DOGE is uncovering and continues to find even more of the Democrats corruption, fraud  and theft of billions of taxpayers dollars. As far as his daughters sweetheart deal, the Democrats put so much pressure to drop her  clothing line contracts forcing her to close her business. However, there are many, many American businesses that have trade deals with China, stop making it appear as though it is irregular or illegal. Donald Trump has done so much for Americans  in his first 100 days. In his 4 years, Joe Biden did not follow the rule of law or the Constitution of the United States. He illegally invited illegal aliens to our country without any criminal record or background check prior to them coming. Biden did nothing but bankrupt America and cause the economy to nearly crash while bringing millions of illegal aliens to the U.S. giving them more benefits and income than any Americans have ever seen. He did more for illegals than American citizens. So, you keep lying and trying to convince yourself that Donald Trump is a bad President. The people know the truth, that’s why they voted for him to fix the Democrats mess and it’s working. The democrats have been defrauding and stealing from the American taxpayers for years.

""Reasonable costs"" arguments for protecting the logistics of the presidency are immaterial and IRRELEVANT when the President plays at a golf course he **owns**.   Then idiots clamor forth and spread the lie that he is actually saving tax-payer money by going to his own establishments, because he can ""stay there for free"" (which he doesn't do), and ""only have his entourage pay for costs"" (which he charges at massively inflated rates).   So no, that isn't relevant here. Stop defending brazen corruption of the presidency.",that_star_wars_guy,2025-05-09T18:59:59,4

"Creating a crypto currency skirts campaign finance laws and allows people to bribe him by pouring untraceable cash into his pockets. [A Saudi family is dumping $2 billion into it.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-family-net-worth-crypto-investments/)  He's charging the secret service ridiculous fees for room/board at locations he owns every time he goes golfing. That's why he's away from the WH so much. He got the taxpayers to pay for increased security at all his locations (adding to their resale value). Estimated taxpayer cost for golfing in just the first 100 days is 26 mil, much of it directly into his pockets.  That's just two things, and there are literally dozens.",hazeleyedwolff,2025-05-09T20:21:12,4
