Everybody online/reddit seems to hate Trump. But people I meet out in the real world are much more supportive even if they don’t love every single thing about him.,GovernmentLow4989,2025-04-29T12:50:30,8
"> “These are not isolated misses. They are consistent, directional, and embedded in the structure of how modern polls are conducted,”  This is completely correct. The same pollsters claiming Trump is experiencing a “free fall” in favorability are the same ones who had Kamala Harris beating Trump in every single poll for months and look how that turned out. It’s not a mistake or even incompetence at this point; it’s intentional dishonestly.   Let’s be honest though, these polls aren’t for us or even for the majority of Americans. These “polls” are for the gullible, ignorant few who still believe these outlets still have even a shred of credibility left.",Apprehensive-Key2297,2025-04-29T14:31:27,7
You mean the same media that said Kackling Kammy was way ahead??🤣🤣🤣🤣,melie776,2025-04-29T15:57:39,6

"We are losing tons of money with this guy. Dow is down 7%, tariffs are causing many companies to go into unprofitable states. Everyone I know is pissed off. Midterms are going to be a bloodbath for the republicans as of now.  This guy was supposed to make us money, cut spending, and cut taxes. I’m not getting any of that right now.   The deal was I put up with crazy spouting populist and in return I get a better economy and woke shit goes bye bye. ",MuayThaiSwitchkick,2025-04-29T15:20:54,9

"It's like you don't even pay attention to the fact that Congress is now working on the 'Big Beautiful Bill' re: tax cuts, with a planned done-by-the-4th of July (Speaker Johnson wants it done earlier by Memorial Day).",WoodPear,2025-04-29T17:01:28,-2
It's called sacrifice. Suck it up. Any temporary pain is worth it for our children and grandchildren.,GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-29T15:45:28,-6
"Great maybe don’t make Americans pay twice a products cost without giving them the tax cut at the same time to offset that. In addition, maybe help businesses that rely on Chinese parts a relief fund or subsidization to bridge them until American automated factories are up. A shit ton of capital is about to be lost soon which means America’s market cap goes down. ",MuayThaiSwitchkick,2025-04-29T17:09:41,-1
"The pain doesn’t even make sense. Im all for tariffs to China, but not creating legislation or plans to move production back to the United States is asinine.   Trump should have introduced a bill that kickstarted American alternatives using money from the tariff pool. ",MuayThaiSwitchkick,2025-04-29T16:00:23,14
"I don't see anything costing 'twice a product's cost' atm.     You sure you're in America re: U.S., and not Canada?",WoodPear,2025-04-29T17:31:50,-1
The tariff is 147 % on China. We pay that at port of entry. What are you on about? Do you know how tariffs work?  If a product is $10 from China. That product is now $24.50,MuayThaiSwitchkick,2025-04-29T18:19:57,4
"*Then don't buy from China*  And please, no cop-out responses that you have no alternative.",squunkyumas,2025-04-30T06:33:39,3
"I’m all for it but some of the items are critical to national security. Like rare earth metals, parts for drones and even our military   America lacks tooling engineers to manufacture some of the advanced stuff. So then why isn’t the president providing help to businesses and people who want to manufacture this at home. It’s going to costs billions, and nobody knows for sure if these tariffs will stick so why invest in the infrastructure. ",MuayThaiSwitchkick,2025-04-30T09:42:53,1
