Trump just doesn’t like smart people.,NAU80,2025-05-08T23:40:16,49
As the Library of Congress is part of the Congressional branch of government I am astonished the president has any power to appoint or fire its head.,econoquist,2025-05-09T00:14:16,31
"Didn't he just fire Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of FEMA, this morning? The US has one vindictive leader.",Fritja,2025-05-08T23:37:33,18
She was the first actual librarian in like 50 years to hold that position.,hitman2218,2025-05-09T03:35:52,17
For a guy who does not read much of anything this is ridiculous.,Protection_Organic,2025-05-08T23:56:24,11
Trump probably pulled wings off of butterflies.,Nicklhames,2025-05-09T00:17:01,8
They do something like this weekly to keep the racists in their base fueled up with hate.  It keeps them blind to being robbed in every other way.,thingsorfreedom,2025-05-09T04:27:17,8

So they can change history?  Stop it from recording the damage being done?,dudee62,2025-05-09T08:37:04,3
"I think the administration wants to continue going about obliterating information. Who keeps track of information? Librarians.  they want to destroy history. Libraries are a great place to start. Ignorance, obedience, cowardice, hatred, fear. The weapons of the new administration.",kz1231,2025-05-09T08:55:09,3
"I’m not surprised, but I had a smidge of hope she would be left alone. Traditionally, the Librarian of Congress stays in the job until they retire/resign. But we know how much this administration LOVES operational tradition.  Also she is a black woman who is great at her job AND she was appointed by Obama. I’m kind of surprised she lasted this long.",Knotty-reader,2025-05-09T09:23:00,2
Which Fox News personality gets the job?,Ace_Bearbus-73,2025-05-09T06:19:51,1
I wonder if they'll hire someone who can actually read?,kz1231,2025-05-09T08:56:29,1
"Go buy the books y'all. Buy copies of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, books of International poetry and anti-racist stories and books of American history that include the achievements of women and people of color. Buy them and protect them because at this rate, the public libraries of America may not be able to provide them to Americans for much longer.",Hotspiceteahoneybee,2025-05-09T17:59:39,1
"Maybe taking this ""The Apprentice"" thing a little too far?     Librarian of Congress: ""You're Fired!""  Jeanine Pirro: ""You're hired""",Catspaw129,2025-05-09T00:59:20,1
Trump doesn’t like Black people.,humanity4u2,2025-05-09T01:22:01,11
They never do.,likelywitch,2025-05-08T23:50:55,10
And he hates librarians - the people who seek the truth and document his lies.,wkomorow,2025-05-09T06:21:01,10
"A good explanation, that.",Fritja,2025-05-08T23:50:48,4
Maybe .... is Trump holding a grudge against her?  ...or someone that supports Trump wanting this?,exophrine,2025-05-09T00:28:24,2
He'll probably replace her with Hulk Hogan or Kid Rock.  The circus continues.,Ok_Juice4449,2025-05-09T05:45:46,8
Racism will destroy the US. Racists will court self inflicted harm to hurt those they hate. Racism has an aspect of selfishness that isn’t exploited to advantage:  the true art of selfishness involves allowing the continued well being of others so you never have to worry about them coming for your stuff. Oh well the US was an unboring experiment,Robbidarobot,2025-05-09T05:24:21,3
Exactly. This is the mission. Erase history. Rewrite history. Destroy how this country became what it is. Destroy any information on how he got to where he is. God I'm getting nauseous. Big surprise.,kz1231,2025-05-09T08:57:18,1
I would make jokes here from your comment but with this guy I believe it's completely possible this could happen.,atrostophy,2025-05-09T10:02:03,4
"Oh, no!  Lol",Ok_Juice4449,2025-05-09T11:04:23,2
"Given a wrestling promoter is our Secretary of Education and a Fox News personality is our Secretary of Defense, yeah, those are completely within the realm of possibility.",undercurrents,2025-05-09T22:32:39,1
