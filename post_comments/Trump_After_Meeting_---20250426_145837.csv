The reality is that USA and Ukraine really don't have any leverage since Ukraine is either losing or has no strategic way or re-gaining territory.  There isn't some technology advantage we can just give and change course of the war.  That never existed.    The only thing only escalation that is possible is allowing deep strikes into Russia but that's already been done limitly so the only escalation is attacking civilian targets.   Which will not happen. Cause the chances of a good reaction is 2%. Being Putin comes to the table instead of going whole hog.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-26T19:22:10,-56

I might be able to give Russian progress stops or slows down.   But there's no tangible reclamation that Ukraine has made. Kurst might be something but that more on Russia no defending low conflict areas and Ukraine is almost pushed them out.   Outside of that I personally think Ukraine has no tangible goal. Getting all the territory back will not happen simple cause it didn't happen when support was stronger and Ukraine had more men. Giving them more weapons system they don't know how to use won't help. And on the Russian side nothing materially change. They still got more shells and now they have more season North Koreans.   I don't even the President cause the whole situation is garbage.

You clearly didn't think about it.   This is a proxy war with Russia. If the goal was to put boots on the ground and use the full might of USA then of course the USA would win.   But its a proxy war. We can only exert amount of force that our proxy can actually handle?  Plan and simple if the countries somehow flip Ukraine and Poland.

"What we should have done is allow Russia join NATO when Putin said he wanted to join. Instead, we shunned Putin and begin to isolate Russia. Big mistake.

Putin will not forget this. I know this because I have been reading and listening to the Russian politicians.  Now, you may be right that we should get mobilized and intervene (we have to send a lot of troops, that is the only way to intervene) due to our mistakes and cockiness, but that will not happen because Zelensky is not well liked, and the collective West is not even remotely politically ready to take on this step. The European and the American public will be overwhelmingly against such decision. This is the weakness of the West, and Russia will exploit it for as long as possible.

">What we should have done is allow Russia join NATO when Putin said he wanted to join. Instead, we shunned Putin and begin to isolate Russia. Big mistake.  I disagree completely. If somebody wants to murder you, loot your corpse, and live in your house you don't invite them inside.  >The second mistake we made is expand NATO eastward. Russia warned us, not to do it, but we got cocky. Now we are acting all ""concerned"" that in the next decade Russia will be a ""security risk.""  Who's fault is that?  I think the basic premise that NATO expanded eastward because they wanted to provoke or pressure Russia is flawed, if not outright incorrect. Those countries wanted protection from Russia far more than NATO wanted to instigate a conflict. And since having more defensive depth (and intervening military mass) is always an advantage, NATO naturally took the opportunity to put a bigger buffer between themselves and the country everyone wants protection from.  If Russia/Putin didn't want NATO to expand eastward, they shouldn't have given their neighbors a reason to join. Russia is their own worst enemy here. Step one of not having your neighbors not unite against you is to stop attacking, invading, and attempting to dominate them, Russia is a ""security risk"" because they actively and intentionally threaten the security of everyone within reach.  >As far as Russia is concerned, Ukranian people are Russians.

"What bottle neck are you referring?   If it’s the shrinking amount of men or the medium age of the Ukrainians, then I fully understand and agree it is a concern. But unless you think the war is already lost (not the case btw) then it’s more of something that needs the be addressed, not written off as something that cannot be overcome.   Every dollar we spend today to protect and arm Ukraine will pay dividends in the long run. While I don’t believe Russia is an active threat to Western Europe, the negative ramifications of winning this war will haunt us for decades. I’d rather keep them occupied and defeated rather than active on the world stage. Taking Ukraine risks further destabilization elsewhere, especially if the US is perceived as weak, uninterested, or isolationist.
