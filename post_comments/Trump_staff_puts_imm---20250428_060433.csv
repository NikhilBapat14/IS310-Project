"=== DECODING MAGA ===  The White House will eventually have a social media feed dedicated to videos of abducted nonwhite people,  LGBTQ people, and women being humuliated, harmed, or tortured.  Because this has always been the apotheosis of MAGA. This is what Trump has promised his jeering worshipers. Public performances of sadism against people who don't ""know their place and stay down in it"".  Egg prices can skyrocket. The markets can crash. Pervasive state terror can replace the rule of law. Free speech can end. State secrets can be openly sold to nations that plan to harm us. They never really cared about any of it. Or more accurately - they cared only about narrow, passing stories that the propagandists told them they were angry about.  Recall that the big orgasm at the end of the Q Anon fantasy was not a picture of a just and peaceful world in which children and adults were all safe from The Big Conspiracy. It was a never-ending orgy of vengeful sadism in which democrats, journalists, experts, and knowledgeable people in general were tortured to death 24/7 on television. This has always been the ultimate MAGA dream.  Even in his first term, Trump never solved anything. He just attacked people and groups  from his high position in the White House. A daily, zealous punching down with clenched teeth and glaring eyes. And this was all his worshipers ever wanted from him.
