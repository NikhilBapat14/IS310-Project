Well that's depressing and terrifying.,snafu607,2025-05-04T06:25:03,3
I just passed a kidney stone last night and that was less painful than seeing the news everyday.,Korndogg68,2025-05-04T09:50:08,3

"To the melody or Deutschland über alles, and images of charging Stuka bombers: ”Donald, Donald über alles we’ll take Greenland and Canada too. We’ll prosecute judges and start some camps. Put our opponents behind bars!”",exforz,2025-05-04T07:45:51,1

It's just a matter of how much Donald will double down after the tariffs have real effects on most people. ,30mil,2025-05-04T05:28:47,1
"No, not really.   The vast majority of this shit is baldly illegal, much of it unconstitutional, and the only reason they were dumb enough to try is bc they mistook cult of personality for a genuine movement.   Once Trump is dead/deposed, whomever they prop up as their new puppet won't be able to hold MAGA's attention (and thus loyalty). Without a base of crazed voters to scare the other senators in line, their plans have no teeth and no one will be interested in upholding what already done.",BabySuperfreak,2025-05-04T05:29:40,28
You’re still thinking in normal political terms. That’s a mistake.,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T07:55:30,12
Trumps replacement will have the last name Trump.,PropaneSalesTx,2025-05-04T07:07:32,11
Just look at post-Chavez Venezuela. That’s where we’re headed. Thinking you can topple a dictatorship with an election is nonsense.,justtots,2025-05-04T15:39:59,3
"What he's done to our alliances will likely never recover.  What he's done to our medical research infrastructure probably won't either.  What he's done to our civil service is less likely to recover too.      He's proven no word from the US government can be trusted beyond a couple of years.  You can't trust the funding that comes out of our research institutes not to be pulled.  He's proven that every other administration can just destroy your career in government.     Even if another administration comes through and restores everything, all the people with expertise that isn't easily replaced, will be gone and often to jobs of higher pay.  They're not going to come back for lower today and a chance to be laid-off again.",twisp42,2025-05-05T00:08:09,1
"This is what I think which is why the Trump 2028 merch isn’t necessarily wrong. The problem for them is, none of his kids have the lure of Donald.",m1j2p3,2025-05-04T07:21:25,17
"No chance. I think even MAGA can't stand the Trump kids, except maybe Ivanka.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-04T09:01:17,5
Maybe one upside of Trump’s megalomania is that he’s too narcissistic to allow his kids to be more successful than he is. None of them could pull it off.,lumberjackname,2025-05-04T08:09:28,8
