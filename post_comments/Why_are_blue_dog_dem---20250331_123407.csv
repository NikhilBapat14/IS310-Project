"Blue dog democrats tend to be from historically conservative areas like Montana, Indiana, Ohio, etc. There was a time when conservative democrats in red states/districts were viable candidates, but polarization has made it so that the people who once voted for them just vote for republicans now.",midnight_toker22,2025-03-31T16:07:07,287
"I think a huge part of it is the rise of social media and how information is spread now. Blue Dog Democrats thrived when local politics was more insulated and people weren’t being constantly bombarded with nationalized, emotionally charged messaging. But now, political discourse is driven by slogans and memes that reward the most extreme, easily digestible takes—stuff like “build the wall” or “abolish the police.” These are simple messages that spread fast and get reinforced through endless algorithmic echo chambers.  The problem for Blue Dogs is that their positions are often nuanced, rooted in compromise or incrementalism, and that just doesn’t cut through the noise anymore. Democratic ideas, especially ones around economic policy or institutional reform, often require more critical thinking and context to fully grasp. But online, nobody’s got time for that. They want a one-liner that confirms their worldview and dunks on the other side.  So in that sense, being moderate isn’t just boring—it’s practically invisible. The Overton Window online has shifted so hard that moderates get drowned out between the chaos of performative progressivism and rage-fueled conservatism. Blue Dogs don’t really fit into either narrative, and they’re paying the price for it.",gk_instakilogram,2025-03-31T16:02:19,190

"How can you stay conservative when the conservatives have gone full right wing bannanas? That's like saying you should be conservative with the roach repellent when there's been a massive infestation. Case in point in 1980 Regan and Bush squared off in Houston during the GOP primary season. They were the last two remaining. Someone asked about undocumented kids in school. Reagan and Bush both said they should get free education. Reagan said he didnt see the point of building walls. That we should pass a comprehensive immigration reform. They both said the undocumented are good hard working people. That will get you primaried today.   Reagan and Bush both supported gun control laws like the Brady Bill and Assault weapons bans. ANY gun control today is ""infringement"". I dont recall any Republicans storming the Capitol during the 10 years of the Assault Weapons Ban.The gun laws in California still on the books today were passed by Governor Reagan. Bush a Texas Republica also supported what Reagan was doing in California. Supporting any of their laws would get you primaried today.   in 1992 Ross Perot a lifelong Texas Republican self made billionaire said ""abortion is betweeen a woman and her doctor. PERIOD"" on the Larry King Live show. There was no revolt against him by Republican voters. In fact he got the most Republican votes for a independent candidate ever.  Saying you support pro-choice will get you primaried today.   in 2001 immediately afte the 9/11 attacks George Bush Jr. a lifelong Texas Republican elected two terms as President went before the full Congress and said ""Islam is a religion of peace"".  Saying that will get you primaried today.   From 1992 to 2020, every last conservative said the Supreme Court had to be originalist and strict constructionist and ""only intepret the Constitution exactly as it was written. Judicial activism that attempted to reverse decades of established precedent would be the undoing of the Supreme Court."" Fast forward to MAGA and not only did the activists right wing Republican Supreme Court judges invent out of thin air ""official acts vs unofficial acts"" that exists literally NOWHERE in the Constitution, its Amendnments, the State Constitutions, the Federalist Papers, or anything else. What happened to your originalism now conservatives? And the silence has been defeaning. Not a single conservative Republican legal expert said any point ""you can NOT indict the President for January 6th because he has immunity as President. Yeah yeah yeah... that whole Nixon thing of him resigning because of serial felonies as official acts. That was just a whoopsie. The activists Conservatives re-writing the Constitution that's totally fine"". Anyone speaking out against this absurd decision would be primaried today.  As far as all this trans athletes ad nauseum talk by the right. There are less than 10 transgender women competing in women's sports out of over 300,000 high school and college sports. That's like 0.001% or something ridiculous. Now ask ChaptGPT to count the number of times that issue is even raised in the first place on political forum, talk shows, YouTube videos and who wants to bet that overwhelming majority are coming from right wing conservatives? Kamala Harris didn't mention it once in any of her campaign speeches nor did Biden. Yet Trump ran a whole wall to wall 24/7 blitzkrieg about it. Never mind that Trump regularly used LBGTQ+ as something he supported in his speeches running for his first term. Nor do I recall a single prominent Republican saying ""we support ONLY LBG and NOT this whole LGBTQ+ thing"". Transgender wasn't raised in a single one of the bonkers GOP 2016 primaries were Trump would talk about his penis. But repeating Trump's own supportive use of the term LBTQ in 2016 will get you primaried today.",PreviousAvocado9967,2025-03-31T16:53:46,21

"Not an expert but:  Battleground districts seem to have shifted from rural to metro suburbs. The Dems have largely given up rural + non-urban working class areas they used to be competitive in, but made inroads in what were once safe (R) wealthier/better educated suburbs.  The ""Blue Dog Coalition""'s decline somewhat mirrors the party's decline with those voters, IMO.  The remaining members of the group appear to generally be members either representing ""normal"" rural populations (ex: VT is rural but no one thinks it's much like most rural areas in terms of politics) or minority populations that often have some views on certain social topics that are sharply out of line with current Dem party orthodoxy. (Abortion, LGBTQ issues, etc).  The New Democrat Coalition doesn't seem to accept as wide a range on social issues/expresses more explicit stances on things like abortion.",SkiingAway,2025-03-31T16:19:46,3
"As far as politicians go, I think they’re just a dying breed. It has been easy enough for the to hold on to their incumbencies, but as they are aging out, newer folks holding similar views are drowned out by the extremely loud fringes of both sides. In a world where nuance and compromise isn’t  valued compared to simple one line dunking and bullheadedness, it’s extremely hard to be heard. People want quick, easy tidbits and nothing more.   As for voters, it seems as if a large portion of them are leaning towards Trump. Much of my work is in large, union plants (refineries, chemical plants, etc). The sort of conservative union democrats that made up the blue dog base tend to relate more with right wing populist policy than progressive policy. They feel the Dem party has abandoned the average, working American in favor of disenfranchised minorities and that the republicans have noticed the average working American and have become less focused on rich elites.   People can disagree with that view all they want. I’m not saying it’s true or false.

Whether they'll stick with Trump 2.0 in light of the cackhanded authoritarianism and targeting of military veterans is a different matter- but the Southern Strategy has worked out well for the GOP so far.  People who want the Democrat part are either Liberals or Leftists (and yes, there is a distinction- Bernie is a Social Democrat, ie a leftist Liberal, AOC is Leftist, not a liberal). The issue of course, is the Corporate/ Wall Street Democrats, who control the fundraising and who are liberal but in no way sympathetic to anything that left Liberals or Leftists advocate, for obvious reasons.

Democratic purity tests became extreme. You used to be able to be a pro life democrat. You used to be a fossil fuel democrat from a coal town.   Look at the attacks manchin and sinema got for supporting 90% of the Biden agenda instead of 100%.

"Two related processes killed off the blue dog democrats.   First, Democratic leadership maneuvered the party to pursue middle class suburbanite votes. In an attempt to build off of the Clinton era success, the party maintained its center-right economic platform while continuing to push the social platform further left in order to capture young voters and educated suburbanites who were put off by Bush Jr’s religious conservatism. Democratic leadership (Pelosi and Schumer included) actively worked to push out congressmen who did were not on board with that strategy, which included blue dog democrats - they were vestiges of the past, and their unwillingness to fall in line on social policy undermined party unity.   The second process was the working class defection to the GOP. One of the drivers of the tea party revolution (the other being massive amounts of funding for primary challenges from the right against moderate Republicans) was working class discontent. Both parties followed the Washington Consensus, which emphasizes free trade, deregulation, and fiscal conservatism. Working class voters felt they got the wrong end of all of those policies, and that neither party would acknowledge it; Republicans told them that what was good for the wealthy was good for them, and Democrats told them that what was good for corporations was good for them. The Tea Party’s anti establishment bent appealed to them, because they felt the establishment was screwing them over from both directions. Then Trump came along and spoke to them like neither party had done, even if he had no intention of ever actually doing anything to help them. He talked about the things they had been saying for years but were not taken seriously in Washington, like protectionist policies to bring manufacturing back. Whether or not you agree with that, it was considered common sense in dying rust belt towns where you used to be able to earn a middle class living with a factory job before NAFTA.   So there isn’t really room for blue dog Democrats under current leadership. They don’t want Democrats who won’t vote with the rest of the party on social issues. And the bread and butter of the blue dog democrats - socially conservative working class voters - aren’t voting Democrat anymore (a generalization obviously, but more true than not).",MrDickford,2025-03-31T18:25:16,2

"Look at the change in their caucus size every election leading up to 2010:  2000: +1 2002: +3 2004: +0 2006: +18 2008: +8 2010: -36  At their peak they made up 22% of the dem caucus. Then in 2010 they lost _half_ of the blue dogs. (which was also half of the overall Dem losses that cycle.)  The DNC (through the DCCC) underinvested heavily in blue dogs that cycle—either ceding the races as unwinnable or waiting until near the very end in an attempt to put all their resources into the subset of seats they thought they could win.   The lack of support was a side effect of overall demographic shifts as more Americans migrated to cities (especially in rich, coastal regions—_where the jobs are_) and those folks got tired of getting blamed for having a “majority” in congress but an inability to pass legislation (making them look ineffective).   Only like 30 out of 54 blue dogs supported the ACA; they were very tepid about gay marriage, and not in staunch agreement with a woman’s right to choose; and they were really opposed to gun control.   So the Dem party abandoned them and they’ve never really recovered. I don’t think it’s the blue dogs, honestly.

"Yeah, we called them Blue Dogs in 2008, but in the 1990s when the two parties were much more the same, they were even more dominant.  Two bit items impacted them: Polarization and 2008 causing a shift towards more systemic change.  In the 80s and 90s, a lot of people were pretty happy with the economic system and a lot of the battles were far more social.  Starting in the late 90s when the cracks around neoliberalism and some of the good in theory (but poorly thought through) trade deals and deregulation started to show finally finally breaking with the 2008 recession and anger over how it was handled.  With increasing polarization, there just isn't as much room for fiscally conservative, socially liberal politicians.  Some of the light red and light blue areas where blue dogs thrived are now dark blue and dark red.  There are just much fewer ""purple"" districts.  Even where they are, they tend to be areas that lean more into economic populism and that feel left behind by either free trade or are made at the current system.  If anything, a lot tend to be more socially conservative areas.  Ironically, if progressive are both socially and economically progressive, there maybe room for a new blue donkey that is relatively socially conservative, but is more economically populist.  The tricky thing is a lot of the blue dogs were funded by Super PACs and other wealthy donors who could care less about social issues, but who were expressly buying politicians to prevent more populist economic reforms.",Sptsjunkie,2025-03-31T16:22:23,7

Her primary voters rightfully saw this as corruption though, which is why she didn’t even bother for re-election. She would have lost.   We have to be careful to avoid the simplicities of the moderate-progressive paradigm. Some Blue Dogs like MGP and Golden truly vote that way because it’s what their district wants. You’ll notice, however, they are more likely to moderate on non-economic issues. They try to actually represent their districts. Other blue dogs tho are neoliberal puppets like Kirsten Sinema who try to represent a mythical “center” that suspiciously corresponds to corporate agendas.

"The average district size in 2006 (the ""year of old"" that OP uses as a reference point where we had 50 Blue Dog Democrats in the House) was 298.4 million.  We still had 435 US House Districts then, so the average was 686,000 people/district.  That's ~75,000 fewer people/district, so about 90% the size of our current districts.  That's a very real change in district size, but also not one so large that it would lead me to conclude that only over the past 20 years did it cause negative effects to manifest.  I think the real problem with the 435 District cap is that the largest and smallest Districts are dramatically different from each other in size.  The largest District today contains 1.051 million people (Delaware's single District), yet the smallest is all but exactly half as large: 0.556 million people (RI's two Districts).  So a Rhode Islander is twice as well represented in the US House as a Delawarean is.  If the number of districts was indexed to the smallest state (by population) getting two Districts, with all other states getting districts approximating that resultant District constituency size, then the biggest gap between district sizes would shrink dramatically both in magnitude and as a percentage of each extreme District's size.  In this hypothetical, Wyoming is still the state with the smallest population and would get 2 Districts, dividing its population into 293,809 people per District.  Targeting that ratio for constituency size, the largest Districts would be found in Vermont (the 2nd smallest state by population), which would also get two Districts of 324,247 people each.  The state with the smallest Districts would be Alaska (the 3rd smallest state by population), which would get three Districts of 246,711 people each.  In this scenario, the largest, worst-Represented District is ""only"" 31% larger than the smallest (compared to 100% larger in the real world).  Put another way, the smallest, best-Represented District is ""only"" 24% smaller than the largest (compared to 50% smaller in the real world).  And compared to the target ratio of 293,809 people/District, the largest is only 10.4% larger, while the smallest is only 16.1% smaller (compared to our current situation, where the largest District is 38% larger than the average and the smallest is 27% smaller than the average).  I know that there is also the ""cube root"" rule for District reapportionment, but either one shows dramatic improvements in how evenly Districts are sized across the country.",cowboyjosh2010,2025-04-01T08:52:40,3

">We see in 2024 that going further right loses elections for Democrats.  I don't think that's really shown in the data.   Up front, there's no doubt that ""the economy"" is the elephant in the room this election - [with roughly 40% of voters in the seven battleground states identifying it as their single most important consideration](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/).   It would be easy to stop there and just chalk the loss up to unavoidable Covid inflation and move on, but I don't think that's right, either.   When we look at more detailed breakdowns, it becomes clear that there's stark divisions along the lines of education, sex, and race. Across the battleground states (and nationally), we lost people with no college degree roughly 56% to 43%. We lost men 55% to 43%. We lost white people 56% to 42%.   In other words, there's a noticeable, sharp trend where we lost blue collar white men - a statistic that dovetails with the *second place* issue articulated in the data: immigration, which was the top issue for about 20% of the electorate. Blue collar white men, who often work in low skill, manual labor roles, are most at risk in terms of economic pressure from immigration.   While immigration may be a net positive for the country as a whole, there's also no denying that a glut of immigrant labor will put downward pressure on job opportunities and wages for this exact demographic of blue collar white men. So the two largest electoral issues for voters - the economy and immigration, at a combined 60% - are actually sort of intertwined for this cohort. The more immigrants there are competing for manual labor jobs, the worse the economy feels for this electoral group who depend on those same jobs.   Personally, I think this is the true crux of what happened statistically.   I think the Democratic party thought we had a lock on blue collar men because of the historical nature of union politics. But as our party's demographics shifted more heavily towards white collar, educated professionals (the NPR crowd - of which I'm one), we didn't fully realize that the NPR crowd's pro-immigration stance was actively at odds with the economic interests of those blue collar men.   We were making a demographic *trade off* when we thought we were building a unified coalition.   A trade off that ultimately lost us the election due to those blue collar white men being the deciding vote in the seven battleground states.  Given that this demographic also tends to be suburban, socially moderate, and religious, I also think it's a safe bet (although I don't have the data to back it up) that this group finds modern social progressive ideology to be toxic.

"For real. Obama winning the nomination in 2008 despite Hillary being the party’s “chosen” was an outright rejection of the “centrist” (but really slightly right of center) way of the Clintons by the party base. Obama messed up by letting the Clintons too close in his administration. The base wanted the “change” Obama promised during his campaign, and that change was much further left of the Clintons — though I do recognize Obama took a while to be on board with same sex marriage, but you also have to remember what things were like back in 2007-2008. I was in high school back then, and it was very much still a big deal to have to come out to your family if you were gay/bi/whatever. The party as a whole messed up in 2016 by trying to push Clinton onto people, **again**, and plotting to crush their own brewing populist movement rather than seeking to ride that momentum. Many younger Democrats/lefties/whatever were pissed off by this and no amount of “well we *tried* to forgive your student loan debt” is going to bring them back under the umbrella. Many of them don’t vote anymore because they believe it doesn’t matter, or they’ve put their hopes behind third parties getting enough votes to be more viable in future general elections. The older Democrats in leadership have completely lost the plot. They’re still riding off LBJ and the CRA of 1964, thinking that minorities are just going to vote for them forever for something that happened a lifetime ago. They’ve dug in their heels and refuse to pass any meaningful leadership positions to younger people who actually understand what we are up against.

"The response is that by creating more representative districts and more of them you better incentivize toward actual coalition building and create space for smaller parties and/or factions to emerge and by extension make governance and policy more aligned with the people they represent.  It's also the core problem with the Senate. Which is simultaneously one of the most powerful legislative bodies in any western democracy that is still functioning, while being one of the least representative.  An Ideal set of reforms would be to lift the cap on house seats, give every state one senator, then apportion the other 50 senators based on population. Then implement a popular vote law for electing the president.  Ideally with non-partisan gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform, and automatic voter registration.

">The Assault Weapons Ban did not cost the Democrats control of the House as evidenced by the fact that Republicans allowed it to lapse on its own and simply chose not to renew it.  I dont follow the logic. That was a Democrat/Clinton lead initiative and it cost then many seats to get it through.   From the memoirs of the staffer that helped organize the effort.  >>Eventually, they made me come down [to the House chamber].

Everybody’s delighted [in the White House]. There’s cheering. It was a big operation. Rahm Emanuel had put together this external outreach operation working with cops and other external supporters. He did a brilliant thing with that.  >>I come back and I’m just sick to my stomach. Everybody’s cheering, pictures are being taken, we’re in the Rose Garden, high fives everywhere. I said, “Mr. President, there’s going to be trouble on this.” . . . Then it went to the Senate. Dole is now getting traction for stopping everything he can on the president’s agenda. We’re in August or July. It’s now moved over to the Senate and we’re having this leadership meeting to prepare for floor consideration. Foley comes over with the leadership. We’re in [Senate Majority Leader George] Mitchell’s office. I’ll never forget—it was a night of storms, lightning just crashing. You can just hear Foley’s mind racing, saying, “We’re still not aligned with the gods on this thing,” or some clever comment. . . . [We] made some concession [in the Senate] and, boom, we got the bill done and went to conference [and finally passed]. That was a whole other trauma, a story in itself. The rest is history. We lost 53 seats in the rural areas [in the 1994 midterms], particularly in the South.  >>When asked if this bill was a key element, Griffin said: “Absolutely. Yes. I’d say, for 40 of those seats, yes. For [Judiciary Committee] Chairman [Jack] Brooks (of Texas) to lose his seat [after 42 years]? Foley? These guys had been safe forever. And they voted against all this stuff but they were still targeted politically because their president was for the [assault weapon] ban.”  >>Even Clinton himself, looking back on the assault weapon ban in his memoir, My Life, concluded that he had likely “pushed the Congress, the country, and the administration too hard.”  https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/when-bill-clinton-passed-gun-reform/488045/  So before, during, and after Clinton and other Denocrats knew it was crossing a line.

"As a general statement, sure. Politics has become more partisan and more national in character. The question is, has this process been symmetrical across parties?    Blue-dog Democrats can win primaries in red districts, but then they struggle to get elected in the general. Liberal Republicans can win general elections in blue districts, but they can't get through Republican primaries. This suggests that the polarisation of the two parties is not symmetrical. This matches what happens when we look at politicians' stances on issues, where again we see much more diversity among Democrats, much less in the way of successfully enforced litmus tests, than we see in the Republican party. Not that there hasn't been any movement in that direction among Democrats, but it has been much weaker and targeted on fewer issues.    So while we can talk in broad terms about polarisation and nationalisation of politics, and this is definitely true for both parties, it is much more true and much more pronounced in the Republican party. So much so that it is more honest to say that the absence of successful centrist politicians is not because 'increased partisanship' in general, but because of the increasingly extreme partisan nature and narrower acceptable stances within the Republican party. The polarisation is not symmetrical, and that's important if we really want to understand what's driving it.",just_helping,2025-04-01T14:27:49,2

"It would be interesting if 10 or so Congressman, decided it would be better to caucus as independents as a way to get factions to compromise and weed out the most extreme positions. Would be absolutely perfect if three or four senators, decided to do the same thing.  That small independently oriented caucus could even be a small party – – not trying to put someone in the presidency but instead focused on fixing the legislative process  EDIT: I recognize the problem with the two party system as it sits today. Perhaps one approach would be five or six Democrats go to leadership and say “….look if I can talk one republican into working side-by-side with me, and Bubba here can talk one more into working with him, would you allow us to caucus independently with those few from the other side?",sailorpaul,2025-04-01T11:57:11,2

"Sure, and Trump won the popular vote by just shy of 2.3 million, while 13.6 million people tuned into Fox that night to watch election coverage. Average monthly viewership is in the lower single digits, but still above that victory margin, and crucially there are significant spikes in that viewership when people tune in to political news.  It's also worth noting that Trump won Wisconsin by just shy of 30k, Michigan by a little over 80k, and Pennsylvania by a little over 120k. So sure, cable news is legacy media, and most people are getting incredibly low quality political coverage from social media instead, but Fox News absolutely plays a role when you look at the relatively small number of voters who are actually deciding presidential elections, and they're part of the apparatus generating that low quality and disinformation laden content that wends its way through social media.",mosesoperandi,2025-04-01T15:47:02,4

"The idea isn't to ""function"" better or worse. Heck, a Congress of 1 *functions* better than 3 or 10 or 500, but we all know how that works out. It's that an average of 750,000+ people per rep is hardly representative at all. Your ability to properly lobby your congressman, as originally envisioned, is dramatically reduced.   The founders initially established 1 rep for every 33,000 persons for a reason. We are far *far* away from that original intent.  Now, obviously the idea of having 10,000+ odd representatives in the house is a tad ridiculous. But places like England ( 1/98,000), Canada ( 1/102,000), France ( 1/112,000), Germany ( 1/115,000) and more, have far more proper representation without things devolving into anything more dysfunctional than what the US has now.

"Not sure ""easier"" is how I'd put it. Yes you can gerrymander with smaller districts.  There are more lines to draw.  But smaller districts make the gerrymanders less sticky.  Small shifts in population can negate the gerrymander.  Gerrymandering in general is only effective the first few years after redistricting.  Best example 2018.  The Republicans gerrymadered *the shit* out of the country in 2010-12 to punish Obama & so Democrats would never win the House again.  2012 & 2014 is when you really saw it work.

It just eliminates gerrymandings effectiveness for a large swath of the population. Go look at a website like Districtr. The vast majority of populations are packed politically. Adding additional reps will create many additional districts who would otherwise could've been gerrymandered into irrelevance. To the money point, the average house candidate raises something like $2.5m - $3.5m depending on the source. More candidates spread money out, making it more difficult to sway house outcomes, but also limits how many ""tipping point"" districts you'll have.  Its easier to dump $10m in a handful of races that can tip the balance than if you had 10x or 100x the number of tightly contested races.",TerminusXL,2025-03-31T18:29:26,5

">With all due respect, I don't think you understand the role/purpose of congress as it was laid out by the founding fathers  I understand it just fine. I think they (Madison in particular) did a shit job and that we're too conservative to change the damn thing. The reason given by Madison in federalist paper 56 for the necessity of districting is so that the representatives will have local knowledge of mores and preferences. My view is that with the advent of gerrymandered districts there is no local insight to be gleaned. The districts don't represent any particular cultural/economic interests. Parties in effect pick their voters rather than the voters picking their representation by drawing the districts such that they won't expect to lose.   *Addenda to all of the above, there have been several law changes that have dramatically impacted the founders original intention of the house.

"At first glance this seems like a valid point, so let's break it down. Yes, the deficit was around $1.0T in 2019 and $1.7T in 2023. However, the federal budget is composed of two components: mandatory spending and discretionary spending. According to the CBO itself:  * [In 2019](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56324), mandatory spending was $2.7T, discretionary spending was $1.3T, and interest was $0.4T. * [In 2023](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727), mandatory spending was $3.8T, discretionary spending was $1.7T, and interest was $0.7T.  So already we see that between 2019 and 2023, mandatory spending, which is composed of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, increased by more between 2019 and 2023 than the deficit. Since mandatory spending is not attributable to the President's or Congress's policy choices, the fair comparison is between discretionary spending, $1.3T in 2019 vs. $1.7T in 2023, a difference on only $0.4T.  Now, 2019 and 2023 are also two different points in time, and as is well known, there was significant inflation between 2019 and 2023. Using a [standard inflation calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), you can see that $1 in 2023 was only worth $0.84 in 2019. So if we put numbers on the same scale, 2023 discretionary spending was $1.7T x 0.84 = $1.428, vs. $1.3T in 2019, a difference of $0.148, or a **10% increase after adjusting for inflation**. Finally, is an increase in discretionary spending a waste of money, even if it adds to the deficit? I would argue no, Biden's investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and microchips are a far better use of money then Trump's tax-breaks to high earners.",VitaAurelia,2025-04-02T09:57:39,2
