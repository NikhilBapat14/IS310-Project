They've also been talking about shutting down some embassies on the grounds that they're unnecessary. This bullshit is probably just a scheme to justify shutting down more embassies than they could get away with otherwise.,shponglespore,2025-05-07T23:45:04,4

"How so? The administration is crusading against DEI as racism against white people. Sweden is a Scandinavian country full of nothing but white people, so they don‚Äôt have the same history we do in America. Whatever policies their companies have to combat racism are small in scale, so what an off fight to pick to alienate our allies and ensure you have just picked a fight you can‚Äôt win for no measurable effect.",RonMexico15,2025-05-08T09:56:47,-1
