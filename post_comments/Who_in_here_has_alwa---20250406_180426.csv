"2018 and ""pedo guy"" is when I stopped thinking he'd be a force for good and realized he's just an idiot who failed up constantly.",1877KlownsForKids,2025-04-06T18:12:43,12
"I started disliking Elon Musk in July 2018.   That was when the guy heading up the rescue mission of those Thai kids caught in a flooded cave explained how Musk's plan to drive a submarine to where they were located was not feasible, and Musk called him a pedophile and even threw together some fabricated evidence just to make the guy look bad.   I still respected Elon the businessman then, but that was when I concluded that Elon the person was a childish douchebag.",dragnabbit,2025-04-07T01:22:57,12

"I've hated Elon Musk ever since I became aware of his existence.   What is there to like?  He's an extremely weird, awkward, fragile, egotistical nerd nepo baby illegal alien who uses his (daddy's) money to create a false narrative that he's a genius creator, inventor and founder, whose own child hates him, and who has multiple illegitimate children with multiple baby mamas.",DoTheRightThingG,2025-04-06T19:47:10,7
I wouldn’t have cared about Elon if he stuck to making EVs and launching rockets. He insinuated himself into our lives. People hate him because he is a racist piece of shit,homerjs225,2025-04-07T01:27:32,7

I was never a fan of a narcissistic nepo baby with [roots in Apartheid South Africa](https://archive.fo/Y1Uz9).   And being part of that Ayn Rand worshiping crowd in Silicon Valley only drove up his negatives for me.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-06T19:20:43,4

"Saw him at the TED talks in 2017, where he was hocking his hyperloop idea. I remember my husband and I saying it sounded so dumb, elitist, impractical, well now we know it was all just a sham anyway. He is also so uncharismatic, even back then. Negative rizz as the kids say. Never understood why people worshipped him.",snarky_spice,2025-04-07T02:51:24,3
Same! My teen kids bugged me for years to buy a Tesla. Not a chance. I’ve always hated those cars and him. I deleted my Twitter account the day he bought it.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-04-07T06:02:36,3

I hated him started with his trying to block experienced cave divers from rescuing the stranded soccer team in the Indonesian caves. Just because he didn’t stop an in-progress rescue to give Musk time to invent a submersible that can navigate a cave system in tidal waters Musk decided the guy running the rescue was “a pedophile”. That told me everything about Musk’s maturity (juvenile) and that he was willing to kill people in order to be seen as a genius.,t92k,2025-04-07T10:47:53,5
Honestly I didn't hate him. I was mildly annoyed by the twitter/x thing. But all bets were off when he signed heiled and ran a coup on the government. Now I hate him.,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-06T18:20:48,3

Yes always. He is a huge tool and I’ve felt like it’s been super obvious for as long as he’s been a public figure. He craves attention and approval.,MySTieMoxie,2025-04-06T18:51:42,2

"I have long considered him to be a jerk, but I’ll confess, there was a time when I bought into the hype that he was some sort of technological genius.

"While he’s smart, he gets way too much credit for being smarter than he is because he has promoted himself for years. He has genius-level people working behind the scenes at his companies but they aren’t allowed to receive credit because he’s an egomaniac. I’ve disliked Musk before he went full MAGA. Now, if possible, I hate him even more because he turned hardcore MAGA.",edawg7l,2025-04-06T19:11:25,2
Here.  Knew what a tool he was when he came onto Tesla and immediately did huge layoffs.  Just a cursory search back then easily revealed he is not and was not a technical genius.,Thyme71,2025-04-06T19:12:55,2
"No, not to the level of today.  He clearly had a not-so-human leadership style, but when car companies were not doing much in the electric car sector, his leadership really did put that sector on the map.  Same with SpaceX, filling the gap in leadership from NASA. But he clearly has stepped out beyond any area of expertise, Twitter and DOGE being two whoppers with horrible consequences for all of us.   I think the Elon mention on ST Discovery was telling, when he is listed as an important leader. I think the episode came out in 2017, probably written in 2016. His positives still outweighed his negatives.  Of course that has changed completely.",johnplusthreex,2025-04-06T19:21:17,2

"Elon was a Dem until Biden basically began to exclude Tesla from Fed-initiated events promoting electric vehicles, all in 2021.  After that is when he began talking shit and got onboard with the anti-Biden 'regime' shenanigans.  A year later, he bought Twitter probably because at that point it was still dominated by liberals.  Prior to this Musk thought that Trump was a moron and in general stayed out of the public's eye (and ear).  Anyways, I liked Teslas and thought that what he was doing with SpaceX was pretty cool.  I mean, for a while he seemed like the closest thing the real world had to a Tony Stark. I also liked that he \[used to\] believed that climate change was real, caused by humans, and that technology was a solution.",crucial_geek,2025-04-07T10:24:20,2
I never paid much attention to him to be honest. If anything I was just annoyed that he always got credit for being some sort of a genius.

I was late to this party but my wife and daughters knew. I was always like 'yeah he's a jackass but he's mentally ill and is doing some cool stuff.'

"I was fairly indifferent to Musk until the Ukraine invasion. When he offered Starlink to the Ukrainians, it made me extremely uneasy, and I realized that I didn't trust the guy. It's not even that he's misused the technology or engaged in chicanery with it, as far as I'm aware. I'd just much rather have that sort of thing in US government hands if it's going to be employed basically as a weapon of war.",infiniteninjas,2025-04-06T18:57:23,1
I looked into his background after a solar panel installation deal I had with Solar City went south shortly after Solar City was acquired by Tesla Energy.
