"Essentially Biden would sign an executive order instructing the Treasury Department not to stop paying America's debts, citing the 14th Amendment as the legal justification. He would probably have to do this before the debt ceiling is actually reached, which pretty much means right now. I think the language the White House has used on it amounts to considering it as an option for next time. Someone would then sue the government, and it would go to court, eventually reaching the Supreme Court, which would rule on whether or not the Debt Ceiling violates the 14th Amendment",loselyconscious,2023-05-16T04:22:15,2
"Well, of course Biden can't just *say* it. He has to declare it.   In all seriousness though, Biden would basically just order the Treasury to keep doing its thing and ignore the debt limit. Congress would then likely sue, it would get sent right to the Supreme Court, and Biden would try to argue that a debt limit violates the 14th, while Congress would argue that Biden's order violated separation of powers.",mormagils,2023-05-16T10:35:03,2
The 14th says anything that prevents the US from honoring/paying it's debts is a violation of the Constitution and that's what President Biden must do to end the GOPerMadness of shutting down the government because they can't do harm to the poor and POC by shredding the social contract under normal legislative procedures.,Olderscout77,2023-05-18T07:22:25,1
">He would probably have to do this before the debt ceiling is actually reached, which pretty much means right now.  If Biden was going to invoke the 14th amendment, he is likely to wait until literally the day or two before we hit the debt limit to issue his orders. This will ensure by the time any court reviews the case, we are past the debt limit. So any court that rules the debt limit as Constitutional will also be ruling that the US must immediately default on their debt.  This would be a ""win-win"" for Biden politically. The first is it will have the GOP suing to force the US to default. Theoretically, suing to have your own country default on its debt doesn't look good. The second is many people would be very hesitant to be the judge who rules that the US must, for the first time in history, default on its debt and crash the world economy. It's entirely likely SCOTUS will rule the debt ceiling unconstitutional because they want to keep the status quo. If SCOTUS rules against Biden and forces the US to default on its debt, Biden can point to the conservative controlled SCOTUS to garner more support for court reform and point to the GOP and conservatives for literally suing to cause the default.",ProLifePanda,2023-05-16T10:47:56,4

"  I found out today that ""invoking 14th Amendment "" in the case of blocking a criminal con man from becoming President again is done by petitioning our State Atty Generals to prevent him from being on our State ballots.  No person who participated, aided, directed, or instigated an act of aggression or insurrection against USA is barred from ever holding any public office.  Whoopee!!! Get busy emailing your State Atty Generals!!!",GrayMatters50,2023-08-20T19:00:32,2
"Well, it could refuse to take the case and leave whatever the lower court decides as the ruling, but that seems unlikely,",loselyconscious,2023-05-31T12:38:18,1
"Looks like that old saw ""*all politics is local*"" is more true than I realized. Thanks for the info",Olderscout77,2023-08-21T09:31:13,1
It was like pulling teeth to finally get the info on who enforces the 14th? The responses went from Congress to SCOTUS. Nope. Turns out to be  We the people (citizens) by petitioning our State Attorney General who gives final approval to candidates wanting a place on their state Ballot.   If Trump gets blocked from state ballots he is no longer a national candidate for President.  https://thedailyrecord.com/2023/08/17/trump-should-be-kept-off-the-ballot/,GrayMatters50,2023-08-21T10:15:44,2
