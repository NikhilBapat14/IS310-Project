"When Trump said he was going to run the government like a business, I don’t think a lot of his voters realised he was referring to his casino business.   What an absolute shitshow.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-03T13:36:13,44
"It should be obvious to anyone now, but in case it's not, DOGE does not know what it's doing.   There's no logic involved here.   There's no foresight, no accountability, no understanding of the systems they are dismantling.   It's a numbers game. X% of people need to go.   They're doing it without talking to the people in charge of these agencies. They are coming in and breaking things, then walking away leaving the broken parts for someone else to try and reassemble and do their jobs.   Because make no mistake, there are jobs that still need to be done.   I've said this before and I'll say it again. Doge is wasting far more money than it will ever save.",thepartypantser,2025-05-03T13:41:28,26
"Yeah, that’s pretty much how it goes every time. They do buyouts or early retirement to save money, then realize they can’t actually function without enough people. Then they scramble to hire new staff who don’t know the job as well and spend even more on training.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-03T13:47:41,8
"Doge efficiency model: Step 1 - break everything, Step 2 - try and fix those things you find you actually really need.",catlessinKaiuma,2025-05-03T18:34:58,4
"Don't worry, Gang. It just makes you look even *more* like you know what you're doing!",Tony2030,2025-05-03T13:35:43,2
Very nice to see these influencers finally get a real voice and some legitimacy,Alwaystired254,2025-05-03T14:59:20,0
"“What logic metric is being used to justify this?"" None!   Did you expect any? From a federal agency?",Miss_Annie_Munich,2025-05-03T13:35:35,-2
The only thing to say about it is the US got what you voted for. It is not like the voters were not warned most of them just didn't bother to show up to stop it.,Erikblod,2025-05-03T15:40:43,7
"A very good point. It is being run like a house of cards. In casinos, the house always wins.",objectivedesigning,2025-05-03T20:23:05,0
That’s assuming they are acting in good faith. They know exactly what they are doing.  In a few years whatever services are still around will be privatized and the rich are going to make a ton of money administering it while protecting their own interests from regulation.  A dysfunctional government also helps Trump consolidate power.,Bronsonkills,2025-05-03T18:08:19,9
"Except this time who would want to fill those positions, when more chaos lays ahead and the job is insecure?",loftbrd,2025-05-03T15:19:07,3
"When I worked at USDA there was a political appointee under Obama who did a version of this. She came up with a plan to reduce the agency through RIFs and buyouts. More employees left than expected and not in the areas she expected. Then they had to hire new people with no experience. It was clear to me then, that neither Democrats nor Republicans cared about the work the agency did. It was all about making the political appointee feel powerful.",FiveUpsideDown,2025-05-04T20:49:31,1
"They cut until they break something. Then they think they know the minimum. Very short term thinking. Many of the heaviest side effects won’t be felt for a while, probably after the people who caused all the problems have moved on.",User4C4C4C,2025-05-03T13:47:35,6
Not his casino. They certainly can be embezzled from and loose.,icedlemons,2025-05-04T09:44:08,1
"Yes and no. They are deliberately doing some things, and they are looking to privatize certain aspects for sure.  They are also deliberately making it difficult for federal employees, but they do not understand all of the mechanisms they are breaking, and how it is truly damaging the country.  The teenage and 20 something DOGE incels certainly don't get the implications of destroying the diplomatic and soft power mechanisms, and I doubt Musk really grasps the damage he is doing to the US standing internationally either.   He genuinely thought he would be hailed as a hero, and yet Tesla is being likely irreparably damaged, and the power vacuum he made by the destruction of USAID and other diplomatic agencies, opens the door for China and their agenda's including chinese EV's to easily fill, all while tanking the market for Telsa.  That shows a lack of foresight and understanding.",thepartypantser,2025-05-03T18:31:15,5
"That is Musk entire model. He’s done the same thing with all the other companies he bought: fire everyone to see which parts are essential and then you can just hire them back later. It’s a fucking stupid model for a business, but it’s an even worse one for a government.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-05-03T13:54:04,9
"Yeah Elon said almost exactly this. ""Don't worry if we break something, we can just put it back"" he said so casually not understanding the government isn't like a new half-baked Twitter feature. When you break the government people die; it's that simple.",mkt853,2025-05-03T13:54:11,7
Elon’s goal is to reduce Americans getting earned benefits. Either by cutting them from Social Security or letting them die by denying health benefits.,FiveUpsideDown,2025-05-04T20:51:43,1
