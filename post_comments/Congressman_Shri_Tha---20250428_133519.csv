"They need to keep doing this.  Introduce new ones every time he does something impeachable, and get all of his egregious lawless actions on record.  Even if it won't move forward, NOT introducing them when they are CLEARLY AND REPEATEDLY called for just makes the Democrats look weak and uninterested in contesting Trump.

"Honestly, it's just... wild that we're at this point again, considering the serious accusations surrounding the creation of this “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)” and, well, Elon Musk's involvement, I mean, what were the exact steps that led to him being granted oversight over something so central to government, and how did that happen at all? It's disturbing, and the fact that Rep. Thanedar represents Michigan's 13th Congressional District, including Detroit, Downriver, and the Grosse Pointes, shows the need for constituents to hold him accountable for these actions, really, I'm just trying to understand it all.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T13:38:36,2443

"Copied from a Facebook post   Senator Chris Murphy asked us to post this statement to your public walls if you can do so without risking your jobs or safety.  DO NOT PRESS SHARE. JUST COPY THE ENTIRE POST AND PASTE IT ON YOUR OWN WALL.  ******  Important read. Please repost EVERYWHERE.  Report from the Senate Floor:  Last night in the Senate, something really important happened. Republicans forced us to debate their billionaire bailout budget framework. We started voting at 6 PM because they knew doing it in the dark of night would minimize media coverage. And they do not want the American people to see how blatant their handover of our government to the billionaire class is.  So I want to explain what happened last night and what we did to fight back. The apex of Republicans’ plan to turn over our government to their wealthy cronies is a giant tax cut for billionaires and corporations. And they plan to pay for it with cuts to programs that working people rely on. Popular and necessary programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, are all being targeted. In order to pass the tax cut, Republicans have to go through a series of procedural steps. Last night, they took the first step which requires them to pass an outline of their plan, but with it, any senator can offer as many amendments as we want. So my Democratic colleagues and I did just that.  Now, we knew that Republicans would largely unanimously oppose them, but we had two objectives here. One, Republicans were forced to put their opinion on record — many for the first time — on the most corrupt parts of Trump and Musk’s agenda. Two, as I’ve been saying, I am going to make every process and procedure as slow and painful as possible for as long as my colleagues choose to ignore the constitutional crisis happening before our eyes.  So what did we propose? We proposed no tax cuts for anyone who makes a billion dollars a year. We made them vote on whether or not Elon Musk and DOGE should have limitless access to Americans’ personal data. We made them vote on whether to protect IVF and require insurers to cover it. Every single amendment Democrats proposed was shot down. On almost every single amendment, Republicans universally opposed it. Every Republican voted against our proposal to prevent more tax cuts for billionaires. The corruption and theft is happening in the open here.  The whole game for Republicans is taking your money and giving it to the wealthiest corporations and billionaires — even if it means kicking your parents out of a nursing home or turning off Medicaid for the poorest children. They know what they are doing is deeply unpopular. They are offering a tax cut to the most wealthy that is 850 times larger than what they are offering working people. Oh and by the way, any tax cuts for working people are going to be washed out by higher costs for basic necessities, like health care and food. It’s a fundamental injustice.  Thanks to your pressure and support, many of my Democratic colleagues have joined my effort to do everything we can to make sure they cannot destroy democracy and steal your money in the dark of the night. We are being loud about what is happening. I’m going to continue to grind the gears of Congress down as much as possible to make it that much harder and slower to get away with this corruption. That’s why the votes lasted until nearly 5 AM.  This is a five-alarm fire. I don’t think we have two years to plan and fight back. I think we have months. It’s still in our power to stop the destruction of our democracy with mass mobilization and effective opposition from elected officials. So we can’t miss any opportunity to take advantage of opportunities to put Republicans on the record and shine a light on what is happening.  And you have a role to play in this as well. I need you to amplify what’s happening, support the leaders who are fighting for you to make sure they can continue speaking truth to power against Musk and Trump’s billionaire cronies, and show up at rallies and town halls. Use every tool at your disposal to send a message loud and clear about how you expect my colleagues to lead and fight in this moment.  Every best wish,  US Senator Chris Murphy",Ecstatic-Koala8461,2025-04-28T15:25:40,128

No amount of disinformation or obfuscation or blaming Biden will be sufficient to overcome the fact that Republicans have left a paper trail proving that they supported him in all of it. What sweet, sweet revenge it would be to turn Trump’s “they/them” ad strategy against him by running a blitz of ads showing Republicans being for “they/them” (the techno-fascists) and “he/him” (Trump crime family).

I just wish they'd use their time differently, go cultivate your hometown districts, go cultivate borderline blue districts, look for votes, go campaign for senators who might be in close races, use your time to look for candidates that might be better than the shit we have now that might just need backing, or go fight against the DCCC and push for changes inside the party so that it's ready to actually do the things required to win.   But all the impeachment stuff, all the photo ops, the going to rallies that will never change anything, holding press conferences, going on media outlets, that stuff is all just performative governance at this point and it's not helping or changing anything in this country.

Everyone needs to keep this in mind when they go out for these national days of protest, because now that his 'administration' is gonna forgive restitution payments (& refund those already paid) by Jan. 6 defendants, those people (incl. Proud Boys, Oath Keepers etc.) now have real financial incentives to go infiltrating these protests, fomenting violent clashes. ",HansSolo69er,2025-04-29T06:22:57,1

"Great, another impeachment that won't actually result in removing trump.  But you know what it will result in? Giving trump another reason to play victim and rally his supporters behind him. *""See, they're trying to get me again! Four indictments. Three impeachments. They're so desperate to take me down! They say they're against me, but they're actually against you!""* That's what he always does. He always acts like he's innocent and people are trying to ""get him"" for unfair reasons. He'll use impeachment as a way to strengthen his support, just like he used the indictments to strengthen his support.  But with the indictments, I actually thought that there would be some kind of result, like trump getting convicted and punished. So I was glad when he was indicted. Same with the first two impeachments -- I thought there was a chance he'd get convicted. But this impeachment is different. We know it's not going to work. So what's the point, other than giving trump an opportunity to stir up his supporters?  After the midterms, once more Democrats are in Congress, then I'd say maybe an impeachment could work. Yes, some Republicans would have to go against trump. But not as many as now. Doing it now makes no sense.",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T14:24:02,1

If Democrats just introduce a bunch of articles of impeachment, the news reporting on them will become unremarkable, and no one will care.   This congressperson is jumping the gun. Dems do not have the votes to impeach Trump, so this isn’t even going to accomplish anything. If anything it will convince idiot voters that Trump is being unjustly attacked because the impeachment articles will fail to actually impeach him…  The dems need to win the midterms, and then single out one impeachment charge. And it should not be the worst thing he’s done. It needs to be something he’s done that would be the most painful and politically damaging for Republicans in congress to defend.  I think they should focus on Trump dropping the federal corruption investigation of Democrat NYC Mayor Eric Adams. There are like half a dozen MAGA feds who quit their jobs when asked to drop the investigation. Those are impeachment trial witnesses that would happily respond to a subpoena and testify under oath that Trump was protecting corrupt Democrats for political gain.

"I think I agree... Although, these days I'm not entirely sure any more.  We know what Trump's playbook response will be. Republicans will protect him from consequences, and he'll play the victim. ""The corrupt Democrats are running scared. Everything I do, they just try to impeach me over and over again, it never works. But you see what will happen if they get in charge. They will kick your elected POTUS out of office and illegally try to take control of the executive branch!"" Or something along those lines. Basically, keep the right scared, fuel their persecution complex. And if there are a large number of impeachment attempts, he'll pick whichever ones are less serious (or easier to rally his base around) to focus the narrative on.  I have no idea. Trump did not get the punishment he deserved while he was out of office, that can probably be blamed on a few key individuals, but between then and when he was in office, a metric ton of his lawlessness got put on the record. Some of it extremely serious, others a little less so. And plenty of it was extremely convincing. Piles of proof, no room for ambiguity. He should have been barred from office, but he was not. The damage done from those investigations should have ruined his chances of winning, and yet he won the popular vote and a majority in congress.  I suppose they should be attempting to impeach him often, since there is not a whole lot else they can do. But it feels like that was their tactic the first time around, and Trump barely lost then (in the middle of a completely botched pandemic response where he pissed off both sides).  Still, they can't accept him breaking the law as normal. So they do need to keep showing that they are willing to hold him accountable. They just needs something else in addition to that.

You have to pick your battle with huge care, and not start it until you’re sure you can get the outcome you want.  If Democrats hadn’t impeached Trump over Ukraine - when they knew it had no chance of going anywhere in the Senate - they might have been able to get a result after January 6. Probably not, because January 20 was like, right there, but maybe.   Same thing here. There’s a midterm coming. Democratic gains are going to be huge.

The first impeachment was about holding up Ukraine aid and pressuring Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the Biden family. The second impeachment was about Jan 6fh.

Yes it would be important that along with the articles there would need solid messaging to the press and in social media outlining exactly what actions caused the impeachment and why they are high crimes or misdemeanors and presenting a solid Democratic opposition. Then getting the microphone into Republicans congressman’s faces as often as possible and asking specific questions about why they are allowing that offense to go unchecked and asking direct follow up questions.  Don’t let them wiggle out from under it.  Hammer them.  Then those videos need to be shared widely.  Dems need a much stronger messaging arm and stronger social media strategy to break through to the general consciousness.

Talk to your local fascist/fascist sympathizer, but do so in a way that's non threatening. Treat it like you're sharing some juicy secrets.  Instead of jumping to attacking Trump, start by acknowledging the bad things prominent Democrats have done.  Yes, Nancy Pelosi is corrupt. She proudly defended insider trading and bribery on Congress.  Yes, Obama was a war criminal, he lied about closing Guantanamo, and he gave money to the very same banks that caused the 2008 collapse.  Yes, Joe Biden was not great, yes he was old and ineffective.  But continue with some easy simple truths about Trump:  Trump passed more gun control than Biden,  Trump lied about pulling out of Afghanistan, he lied about ending the Russian invasion.  ""The fact is, none of these people are working for us, corruption is rampant and we need to work together to right the ship""  YMMV, but ive had lots of success by first lowering their defenses with some easy dopamine about how bad establishment libs are, and then very casually and matter-of-fact-ly (not a ""gotchya"") point out that Republicans are doing the same shit. Don't waste time or effort defending liberals who've failed us, even if you personally like them. They were all complicit in getting us into this mess, capitalize on their failures by showing that youre not blinded by party lines.  Once you drop the partisan act, maybe they will too....

Each failed impeachment means the next impeachment is even more likely to fail.   There may be a time to resist, but I don't think it's yet. Unfortunately a lot of Americans like it when 'illegals' get 'deported'. We have to wait for 'the economy' to tank before people care about human rights again.

"I at least can calm you a bit in terms of Trump and fascism. Looking closely, I think there are some pretty crucial policies missing that fascist regimes depend on and Trump is moving in the other direction:     1. Weapon control: Every fascist regime tries to limit the rights for the possession of weapons for civilians. This is a pretty crucial step when implementing a dictatorship. The Nazis did it, China does it, Russia does it, etc. You can hardly pass unpopular, extreme laws, when an armed population simply says ""no you don't"". Trump on the other hand does not touch the second amendment and lets Dems arm themselves (because more Dems bought weapons since Trump took office)  2. Freedom of speech: The first step to fascism is to limit what people are allowed to say. X, Elons media, is more open than it was before he took over (but I'll admit that he started to use some of the previous X features to limit exposure of some comments. It is still better than it has been before though, but I do not like that trend). In general, whilst Trump always has a fight going with the media, he does not attack free speech.   3. With banning CBDCs (central banked digital currencies) he also made a huge step against mass surveillance. ""What the heck, I never heard about CBDCs"" you might say. Well, they are a central bank controlled crypto currency, basically uniting the negative sides of traditional finance and crypto. The money can still be endlessly printed, as the central bank is in control of it, but at the same time they can see all transaction from everyone that uses this type of money and potentially can set an expiration date for the money or do all other kinds of wacky monetary policies. It is something the central banks globally worked on for years and Trump killed it for now.      Also, do not misunderstand, I do think that Trump fights the current system, but the actual background is a bit more complicated. As hinted on, the fight here is ""new finance"" (Crypto billionaires) against ""traditional finance"" (The other billionaires). Trump so far has positioned himself clearly on the side of Crypto. This is not ""the good"" side, it is just not the established side. The main reason why everything is so supremely chaotic though, is that Trump is simply not very competent (surprise). However, it is an important puzzle piece to understand the situation a bit better, as it is not simply ""rise of fascism"", it is more complicated. Which also does not mean, that it could not turn into ""rise of fascism"" at some point.",RareRandomRedditor,2025-04-29T05:50:30,1

"Relevant text is found below, as well as a link back to the source.  I think it’s pretty apparent that this involves conduct within the House, not impeaching a sitting president. And given that “**the Speaker** (currently Mike Johnson, Republican) **then decides whether the resolution raises a valid question of privilege**” gives you an idea of its ineffectiveness in this case of trying to impeach the president through this procedure.  ###  **Questions of Privilege in the House**  … Clause 1 of House Rule IX recognizes two kinds of questions of privilege: *questions of the privileges of the House* and *questions of personal privilege.*  **Questions of the Privileges of the House**  Under Rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ""those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings."" For example, questions relating to the seating of Members and the organization of the House at the beginning of a Congress have been held to raise questions of the privileges of the House, as have questions relating to the health and safety of Members and staff. Other subjects giving rise to questions of the privileges of the House include the presence on the House floor of unauthorized persons, the conduct of those in the press gallery, the integrity of the Journal, the protection of House records and files, the accuracy of House documents and records, the integrity and regularity of an electronic vote, and the attempted bribery or corruption of Members.  The Speaker determines whether a question that a Member has raised does in fact qualify under the House's precedents as a question of the privileges of the House. Two of the general principles that guide the Speaker in making these determinations are stated in House Practice. First, a question of the privileges of the House ""may not be raised to effect a change in the rules of the House or their interpretation""; and second, a Member ""may not by raising a question of the privileges of the House under Rule IX thereby attach privilege to a question not otherwise in order under the rules of the House"" (in other words, make a question a matter of privileged business).  **Questions of Personal Privilege**  Clause 1 of Rule IX defines questions of personal privilege as ""those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct"" of Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner individually in their representative capacity. Under this rule, a Member may rise to a question of personal privilege on the floor to respond to criticism of integrity specifically in relation to his or her representative capacity. Again, it is the Speaker who determines whether an allegation or statement gives rise to a question of personal privilege. According to House Practice, the allegation or statement must refer to an individual Member and must reflect directly on the Member's integrity or reputation. ""Mere statements of opinion about or general criticism of his actions as a Member ... or his voting record or views ... do not constitute grounds for a question of personal privilege.""  Members have raised questions of personal privilege to respond to allegations about matters such as misuse of public funds, conflicts of interest, abuse of the franking privilege, corruption and bribery, criminal conspiracy or perjury, violation of the securities laws, and knowingly making a false statement with the intent to deceive. Members may rise to questions of personal privilege to respond to such public criticisms, whether made by other Members or, for example, in private publications. A question of personal privilege, however, ""may not be based on language uttered on the floor of the House in debate,"" according to House Practice, because House rules provide a different recourse for such a case: a timely demand that the objectionable words be taken down.  **Floor Action on Questions of Privilege**  A Member raises a question of the privileges of the House in the form of a resolution. The Member rises on the floor and states, ""Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House, and I offer a resolution which I send to the Clerk's desk."" The text of the resolution is read. If it is the majority leader or the minority leader who offers the resolution, the Speaker immediately rules as to whether it constitutes a valid question of privilege. If the question is raised by any other Member, consideration of it may be deferred until a time and place within the next two legislative days that the Speaker designates in the legislative schedule. When that time arrives, the Speaker then decides whether the resolution raises a valid question of privilege.  If the Speaker determines that the resolution does raise a valid question of privilege, the House proceeds to consider the resolution under the one-hour rule, with the time for debate equally divided between the resolution's proponent and either the majority leader or the minority leader, as the Speaker determines. The House may agree to order the previous question on the resolution; if so, the House proceeds to vote on the resolution without amendment or further debate. If the previous question is not ordered, debate may continue under the one-hour rule, and the Member controlling the time may propose an amendment to the resolution. Motions to table or refer the resolution, or to postpone its consideration, are also in order.  A Member raises a question of personal privilege simply by stating that he or she is rising on the floor for that purpose. A question of personal privilege is not raised by resolution. The Speaker then asks the Member to explain the grounds on which the question is based. If the Speaker determines that the Member has raised a valid question of privilege, that Member is recognized immediately to speak for one hour. After this hour for debate, the House takes no further action on the matter. No vote occurs, because there is no question for the House to decide.  https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/98-411",UnabashedHonesty,2025-04-28T17:23:59,1

"No, it's a matter of truth. Say what you will about the Republican party but they are relentless about pursuing their agenda, and they've never let something as insignificant as ""Not having someone in the white house"" or ""Not having majority in Congress"" or ""Not having a majority in SCOTUS"" or even all three stop them from getting their way and stonewalling the Democrats far more often than by all claims they should be able to.  Had the Democrats been as relentless about their own we wouldn't be here, Trump would be in jail, and the Republican party itself would be a distant memory. It's the fact that the Democratic party has been doing next to nothing whether they are in power or not that led to this exact situation. A Trump was inevitable because the Democrats did nothing to stop it. They had every chance to do so between 2020-2024 and did nothing, like they always do.  Every single election cycle the Democratic party's message is the same: ""The Republicans suck! The Republicans suck! The Republicans suck!"" Hardly anything about what the Democratic party has actually ACCOMPLISHED over the years, no, it's always about what the Republicans have burned down since the last election cycle. The reason for that being that there's not that much the Democratic party has actually accomplished or even tried to accomplish.  Biden dug us out of the hole Trump threw us in the first time, but one has to go digging to even find out about what he did to do so, and even when Biden had Congress he did nothing to jail Trump, get rid of the two blatantly corrupt SCOTUS judges, or anything else whatsoever. He had every opportunity stop this nonsense from even being a possibility and he NEVER did a single thing. I'm not talking about illegal stuff he could have done just like Trump is doing, I'm talking perfectly fair and legal means he had to do so. Firing Garland and replacing him with someone who would have gone on the warpath against Trump could have been done with the stroke of a pen at literally ANY point in his presidency.  That's why impeaching every chance they get is important. It would show the country that the Democratic party are actually TRYING to do something, but they never do. That's because the entire political strategy of the Democratic party has been to do next to nothing, wait for the Republicans to screw up the country when the Republicans are in power, and then use the fact that the Republicans screwed up the country to get back into power, upon which they proceed to continue to do next to nothing because actually doing something would have required effort.       It would not undermine the idea of impeachment to call for impeachment every time Trump does something to deserve it. That is what impeachment is FOR, to try to make the president face consequences every single time he performs an impeachable act. Success or failure to do so is irrelevant.      It's the fact that they're not doing so and only throwing out these one or two token attempts over the past 4 months that are undermining impeachment. The reason nobody has any respect for the process is specifically *because* it's so ridiculously arbitrary when they decide to try to do it. When everyone breaks laws and rules and it's almost never enforced, they tend to lose respect for those laws or rules.      It's either every single time Trump commits an impeachable act, or the concept of impeachment doesn't mean anything.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T20:52:10,1

"You can’t bargain fundamental rights with the people actively trying to destroy them. The people pushing for an abortion ban, Trump, the MAGA base, the Federalist Society, the GOP leadership are the same people who are enabling unchecked presidential power. They want the president (as long as it’s their guy) to have total immunity. They want a king, not a president. Bargaining with them is like trying to trade hostages with the hostage-taker who’s already decided the hostages don’t matter.  Because the reality is they’re not negotiating in good faith. They don’t care about constitutional principles except when they can be weaponized against their enemies.  If they cared about rule of law, they wouldn’t be backing a guy calling for mass camps, promising “retribution,” and openly vowing to ignore court rulings.  You can’t trade away basic human rights for promises from people who think rights are privileges for “the right kind of people.” The second you give them the abortion ban, they have no reason to negotiate anything. You’ve already handed them the prize they wanted most.  Even talking about “trading” rights like abortion access backfires politically because it frames fundamental human rights as negotiable commodities, things you can barter away depending on the situation.  You don’t negotiate fundamental rights with people who want to end fundamental rights. You don’t offer up pieces of your humanity in the hope that authoritarians will show restraint. History shows, they won’t.  You’re right to want accountability, limits on power, and to end presidential immunity but trading away abortion or other rights won’t get you there. It’ll only strengthen the people most determined to never be held accountable again.",Quirky_Fly_5452,2025-04-28T20:31:54,1

">You’re letting a carpetbagger weaponize your desire for action and justifying it by saying “what I think is a a matter of truth.”  No, it's not ""I think it's a matter of truth."" It's ""a matter of truth, period, and  incredibly obvious truth at that."" It's like me arguing ""water is wet."" It's not a position that should even require defending.  The very idea that they shouldn't try to impeach Trump every single time he does something impeachment worthy is like saying we shouldn't try to convict a drug dealer/convenience store robber/pickpocket/etc caught red handed 9/10ths of the time because we don't have an absolutely perfect case. No, we get them on trial and convicted every single time because if we didn't, then the law means jack.  We can't selectively enforce and expect impeachment to be respected. Either we try to enforce every single time a crime or Constitutional break happens whether impeachment has a chance in hell or not at the time or it means that there is no law, that there is no Constitution. If we're not going to try to impeach Trump every time he does something impeachment worthy then he might as well burn the Constitution on national television and declare himself dictator for life right this minute for all the difference it makes.  >This is how we ended up with all these milquetoast dems in the first place.  Letting the Dems get away with doing next to nothing for decades instead of making them take action is how we ended up with all these milquetoast Dems. Forcing the Democratic party to get off their asses and try to impeach Trump every single time they have grounds to do so (and there have been plenty at this point) would do the exact opposite of creating milquetoast Dems, it would both galvanize them and make voters want to support the party.  The fact that the Democratic party have been standing there letting the Republican party kick them in the balls over and over and over and over again with at most a ""would you please stop doing that?"" as a response is the entire reason why voters don't support the Democratic party anywhere near as much as they easily could. It's why they keep losing against a party that has freaking Donald J Trump as a candidate of all people, voters don't trust the Democrats to do anything when given power because they hardly do anything whether they're in power or not.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T21:38:46,0

"Your opinion that attempting to impeach repeatedly creates more support for impeachment in the future is not a matter of truth. It’s just an opinion and one that is easily countered by the existence of exposure therapy, tolerance, and anyone who has been told the same story over and over. You just keep saying “if they try then people will like them more” like it’s a 100% guaranteed fact.   I mean it’s just blue maga bullshit, you think if they do the thing you like it will magically create the outcome you want. When the reality of the situation is someone is using your desire for action to launder their reputation to prevent actual progressives from primarying them. You’re so desperate for anything, that you’re desperate for theater even though you know that the person doing it isn’t acting in good faith. I just can’t understand how that logic tracks.  This person is a grifter! They aren’t going to do it for every thing Trump does l, they’re just doing it today to bury the story about their primary challenger. Please stop focusing on optics and focus on the functional relationship and power structures, that’s what republicans did. They stacked courts and fixed the system while you were begging dems to talk right. Now you’re defending another sinema in the making because you’re desperate for a shred of good news.  It’s just an insane way to live “my opinion is truth despite any evidence to the contrary and it requires no defense or critical analysis, it is simple truth that is above reproach.” You’re just as deranged as those maga fucks",lpsweets,2025-04-28T21:46:25,2

"Totally understood, and I appreciate the honesty in your answer. But here’s the hard truth, if we’re not willing to defend rights when they’re under threat especially from authoritarianism, we’re not just choosing peace. We’re choosing slow erosion.  Rights don’t disappear all at once. They’re chipped away bit by bit until one day you wake up and realize you don’t have them anymore. If we don’t stand up and if we always choose the path of least resistance then the people pushing fascism don’t meet resistance at all. And eventually, they make the rules for everyone.  This isn’t just about abortion. It could be the right to vote. The right to marry who you love. The right to speak freely or protest or exist without fear. Every right becomes vulnerable when we decide some just aren’t “worth the fight.” Freedom is never guaranteed. And if we’re not willing to protect it, we all lose it.  “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’ We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‘justice too long delayed is justice denied.’” MLK Jr Letter from Birmingham jail  The very idea of concessions, that civil rights could be achieved by waiting, compromising, or going slower to avoid discomfort is what MLK knew would never bring about the freedom he was fighting for.  The movement didn’t succeed because people made concessions, it succeeded because people refused to.  So to answer your question, yes. I’m not fighting for the right to have an abortion. I’m fighting for you, my MAGA neighbor, my elderly co-worker. We’re all Americans. We live here together. We raise our kids here together. We fight the same battles to afford food, housing, health care, and a future. Together.  We are Americans first. Not Republicans first. Not Democrats first. Not white, Black, Latino, or Asian first.
