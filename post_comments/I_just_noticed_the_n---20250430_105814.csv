"Sometimes i wish he didnt say and do things that make him like a petty child...but again, sometimes its needed.  He knows how to trigger his haters. I do feel some of it goes too far, esp when some dont understand when hes serious or trolling.",AtomicFox84,2025-04-30T18:24:33,12
Sometimes we do a little trolling.Â ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T05:31:22,2
"I think the trolling is often hilarious.  The outrage of the left has definitely fueled a lot of Trump's success.  But, I really hope being a brazen arsehole doesn't become a super long lasting trend.  Watching the lefty loosers try to imitate Trump is exceedingly cringe.  I'm not looking forward to any mini trumps in the future.  I would like to get back to a more respectable rhetoric eventually.  It's super fun on the internet, but in real life with normal people in a working environment this behavior is completely out of place, and I can't even fault my normal friends who don't like Trump.",murderinthedark,2025-05-01T09:31:51,4
