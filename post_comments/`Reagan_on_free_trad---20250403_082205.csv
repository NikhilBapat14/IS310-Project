"Could we please stop the Reagan glazing? This man is one of the worst presidents in American history. He tore down our unions, rolled back workers rights, fought LGBTQ rights, allowed the aids epidemic to get out of control, and negotiated with terrorists for an election victory. This is a man who is beyond evil. Reagan is the idol of the fascists. We do not need his words. We will not use them.",Unaccomplishedcow,2025-04-03T08:55:52,45

"I was against what Reagan did back then. One of his trade people said something to the effect of ""I don't care if we make silicon chips or potato chips"". That was stupid then and is stupid now. We want to make both.  What Trump is doing now is just plain stupid, however. Wayyyyy too blunt and broad.   Pick and industry to two to build up. We were doing just that with the CHIPS act in terms of domestic semiconductor production. Focus on that, invest in education that supports workers in that industry.   The auto industry had things worked out where they were making the higher profit margin stuff in the USA and having Mexico, a free trade pattern, do the lower profit margin small cars. Why F\*CK that up? If you want to reduce boarder crossings, then jobs in Mexico and Central America are the way to do it.",GG1817,2025-04-03T09:05:28,1

"The good news is that if and when the Dems win the trifecta, they can roll back these tariffs and start a new economic recovery - akin to the FDR recovery - and probably push the republicans out for 30 years.",MarkGarcia2008,2025-04-03T09:37:43,1
"Unlike most on this thread, i think this is very important, to hear from one of the most conservative presidents of the post-war era.  many seem to think he was as bad as trump.  he wasn't even close.",Weakera,2025-04-03T10:58:52,1

I think that OP was just quoting the old Republican Jesus (Reagan) to show the hypocrisy of following new Republican Jesus (Trump). I don't think it is meant to whitewash Reagan's legacy.  My main gripe with the post is that showing GOP hypocrisy is shooting fish in a barrel at this point so who cares?,Whispering_Tyrant,2025-04-03T09:45:50,26
"When debating, it's perfectly fine to reference or quote sources which your opponents claim to be in tune with but, in fact, are hypocritically giving lip service to while being in total contradiction of.  And frankly, if Reagan said something that I agree with it would make me look foolish to pretend otherwise. Just because I totally agree with what he said  about the Evil Empire does not mean I endorse his flirtation with Latin American dictators.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-03T10:38:14,6
"All that and he was still 100 times better than trump.  His words are very useful to direct at Republicans.  They'll hear it better from their own side.  ""We will not use them""  You sound autocratic yourself, saying what ""we"" will or will not use.",Weakera,2025-04-03T10:56:10,4
"No one is Reagan was good, no a single sane person. However, like how a broken clock is right twice a day, he's right in this instance.",NaSMaXXL,2025-04-03T10:26:00,4
"He also slashed funding for Medicaid and Medicare, which made out of pocket healthcare costs skyrocket, and he slashed funding for the Department of Education, which led to college tuition increasing exponentially and public schools drastically losing funding.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-03T10:33:50,2
"Yes, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. He was terrible but he was also right about how destructive tariffs are to world economies. No-one is lionizing Reagan here. Just pointing out how far the Republican Party has fallen if even someone who they once revered as a saint would have been against what they are doing now.   Also, Reagan was a young man  during the depression era so he knew firsthand how bad things got for most people   Trump has been coddled his whole miserable life and has never had to really work to stay afloat. He‚Äôs never suffered with poverty or losing a job and not knowing how he would pay his bills or rent/mortgage etc. He has zero understanding of the struggles of average Americans. In the end, we‚Äôll all be hurt by his idiotic tariff wars, but he won‚Äôt because he lives in a protective bubble.   I hate Reagan, but I hate Trump a WHOLE lot more.",mmorales2270,2025-04-03T11:55:40,2

"For what it may be worth, back then LGB was barely a thing and even Dems would be hard pressed to agree on the TQ parts. The U.S. was generally a lot more conservative, liberals were closer to the center, and even in 2004 when California attempted to legalize same-sex marriage there was heavy pushback from Dems.   As for AIDS, yes, but do we have a cure yet?  Biotech was in its infancy and something like an Operation Warpspeed non-existent although a shit ton of researchers were looking for a cure. People did change their tune once it became apparent that it was, in fact, not the 'gay' disease and could infect anyone.  But, Raegan was all about free markets and opened up the U.S. to globalism.  Raegan also had a clear ideology.  We don't have to agree on them, but these are things that Trump clearly lacks.  At least Raegan cared about the U.S., no matter how twisted.    You forgot to mention that Raegan firmly believed that Russia was the scum of the earth and that nuclear war was inevitable.",crucial_geek,2025-04-03T09:07:16,-1
