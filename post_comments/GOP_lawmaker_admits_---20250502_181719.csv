The whole GOP's existence is based on lies......greed....and ignorance.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-02T18:44:33,13
">Texas state Rep. Stan Gerdes (R), who [introduced a bill last month](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/03/gop-legislator-files-bill-to-stop-furries-from-using-litter-boxes-in-schools/) to ban students dressing up as animal “furries” and using litterboxes at schools, has admitted that he has no proof of those things ever happening in a school in the state, despite claiming otherwise when he first unveiled his bill. In fact, Democrats have accused him of introducing the bill to turn Texans against public schools in favor of Republicans’ long-sought-after school voucher program that would redirect taxpayer funds to private charter schools.  >When Gerdes first introduced the “Forbidding Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Education (F.U.R.R.I.E.S) Act,” he claimed that “a furry-related incident” occurred within the Smithville Independent School District, a small district outside of Austin that serves only 1,885 students, representing 0.03% of the state’s 5.1 million public school students. He didn’t elaborate about the incident nor did he cite any news coverage of the alleged incident.  >The legislation would allow anyone witnessing the acceptance of non-human animal behavior by students to file a complaint with the state attorney general, who is currently Ken Paxton, a transphobe. The attorney general could then issue a $10,000 fine against schools for a first violation or a $25,000 fine for subsequent violations.  >Democratic Texas state Rep. James Talarico asked Gerdes if the legislation would allow someone to persecute a school for allowing a student to lick their fingers after eating Cheetos since it defines “non-human behavior” as “licking oneself or others for the purpose of grooming or maintenance.” Talarico asked whether students reading George Orwell’s 1945 political novella *Animal Farm* would be breaking the law if they made sounds like the barnyard animals portrayed in the book.  >However, under recent questioning by a state Democratic legislator on Tuesday night, Gerdes said he filed the bill after hearing “reports of the presence of a furry” in a Smithville school but “could not point to a single example of a school providing litter boxes to students,” [*The Houston Chronicle* reported](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/furries-bill-greg-abbott-20294538.php).  Perfidious, prevaricating snollygoster. That perfectly encapsulates Stan Gerdes of Texas.      He and his Christian nationalist coterie just make up lies, violating the 9th Commandment. They lie and break God's word, while claiming they're doing God's work.     They're utterly pathetic.      They just want to take and tear down schools, so they can make schools into child soldier camps, where they exterminate the trans and queer kids in a ditch. Fascists is not a strong enough word for them. They're genociders.",southpawFA,2025-05-02T18:23:02,41

"The last sentence is similar to what I notice with a lot of conspiracy theorists. It's less about the actual conspiracy that they think they've identified, and more that they believe that they have some secret knowledge that no one else could figure out that validates their worth as a person.

"I have a habit of finding Facebook posts with people claiming that kids are using litterboxes in bathrooms and speaking in meows, and ask them what their proof is. They usually claim that they or one of their friends saw it personally, sometimes even saying it's a teacher. I then ask them to provide a picture or anything similar, since if it's actually happening, you know there'd be some picture from one of those teachers or another student. It's usually at that point that they curse at me and make some demeaning comment about something on my profile, then block me.",platinumarks,2025-05-03T00:13:45,7
