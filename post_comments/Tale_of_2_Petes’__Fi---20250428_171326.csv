This entire cabinet is an embarrassment.  I still can't believe the WH Director of Communications posted a comment that a CNN guest commenting on Trump's health was a piece of shit.    Barely makes a ripple.  That would have been an immediate termination in normal times.  But the media has normalized these whackadoos.  We are so fucked.,Kantsas,2025-04-28T17:21:57,11
He's just like his boss... it's a reality show presidency. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-28T17:21:13,10
The guy who got a makeup studio installed in the Pentagon is consumed by image?  I dunno if I can buy such a fantastical story from the fake news media! /s,redpoemage,2025-04-28T17:18:39,19
Absolutely **not** spending his time actually running the bureaucracy of the Department of Defense.  Shocking since he couldn’t run small advocacy groups and never had command of more than 30 soldiers. He has no idea what he’s doing (or even supposed to be doing),Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-28T17:25:53,8
