"To any Democrat holding their fire for the midterms or taking a ""wait and see"" approach because they are afraid of being called cringe by gen Z chuds...wake the fuck up the regime is arresting judges.    At this rate there wont be midterms, or if there are there will only be one party allowed to be on the ballott.",StashedandPainless,2025-04-25T10:43:43,23

"Now kash Patel and Pam bondis real value are going to start to show. Having an FBI and DOJ completely in lock step with the President willing to do whatever he wants to attack enemies and imprison them is how we get true authoritarianism. With a corrupt FBI charges can be brought up and evidence “found” later to back up the charges, allowing trump to imprison whoever he wants.  This was all just a matter of time once these people got comfortable in their new roles. Remember we are only 3 months in.",tresben,2025-04-25T10:54:21,1
"From what I've seen, it looks like the judge did misdirect ICE on purpose.  >""The courtroom deputy then saw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like 'Wait, come with me,'"" the complaint states. ""Despite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge DUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the 'jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse.""  https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-hannah-dugan-arrested-fbi-allegedly-helping-undocumented/story?id=121161497",crazysoup23,2025-04-25T17:23:20,0
"ICE interrupted an on-going hearing, and then started a commotion. She was trying to regain control of the case at hand. That is exactly what her job is in that situation. The Gestapo can wait…",StrGze32,2025-04-26T07:42:16,3
"> ICE interrupted an on-going hearing, and then started a commotion.  That's not what happened. Are you misinformed or are you lying?  >When Judge Dugan learned ICE officers were present in court to arrest Flores-Ruiz, she became ""visibly angry"" and said the situation was ""absurd"" before leaving the bench and entering her chambers, according to the complaint, which cited witnesses who spoke to the FBI.  >Dugan and another unidentified judge then allegedly approached the arrest team in the public hallway, according to the complaint. She was ""visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor"" and asked one of the officers whether they were present for a court appearance, the complaint alleged.  https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-hannah-dugan-arrested-fbi-allegedly-helping-undocumented/story?id=121161497",crazysoup23,2025-04-26T07:44:21,0
