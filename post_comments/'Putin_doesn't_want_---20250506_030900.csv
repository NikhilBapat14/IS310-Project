Almost everyone who works under Trump comes to despise him. Pence seems to have had an awakening,LookOverall,2025-05-06T04:19:03,178
"Trump is going to say Pence is weak minded and influenced by lunatic left idealogy or he's just scared of them. I can already see it.  Anyone who opposes him is automatically labeled as an enemy of democracy but democracy is about having the freedom to have opposing ideas and working together to objectively reach decisions by respectful debate.  Not for Trump though, his definition of democracy revolves around lies and manipulation.  ",arilupe,2025-05-06T05:17:37,39
"Yeah, Putin’s goal has always been about control, not peace. He wants Ukraine under his influence, simple as that. Pence calling out Trump here isn’t surprising, but honestly neither of them have a real plan for how to deal with Russia anyway. It’s just politics at this point.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-06T05:12:38,9
Wow an American who knows what's going on in the world. No wonder that it is no longer suitable for the current government.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-06T05:32:51,12

No fucking shit. He could have peace at any time by walking away.,Smaynard6000,2025-05-06T08:21:22,3
"We need to see a few more Republican politicians whose careers were ended due to a failure to acquiesce to the Trump idiocy speak out against him. The cultists used to trust them, it might be easier than getting them to listen to Dems.",JJscribbles,2025-05-06T08:39:34,3
"He also wants Belarus, Georgia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania  and maybe Finland. Putin wants to rule more, and wars keep the rifraf busy",smitherenesar,2025-05-06T10:40:26,3
No shit. Should be absolutely blatantly obvious to everyone that Putin doesn't want peace.   It's like punching someone in the face then claiming to be a pacifist.,Dogscannotwearsocks,2025-05-06T16:09:08,3

"Let’s stop feeding the narcissistic machine. Every time we use the T-word, we boost the brand of someone who wants us to obsess over him good or bad. Instead, let’s starve the algorithm. Rename him, deflate him, mock him, or better yet: erase his cultural dominance by refusing to say his name at all. Call him  DRUMPF, the Not-So-Great Pumpkin, Donnie Two-Scoops, Agent Orange, the Fauxphet, Cheeto Caesar, the Bronze Calf, Baron of Bankruptcy, or just The Former Guy. The less we use his real name, the less power he holds let mockery do the talking, and history do the forgetting.",ANONYMOU5COWARD,2025-05-07T03:56:48,1

But yet they still voted for him. Fuck them all.,R2-D2Vandelay,2025-05-06T08:30:22,32
i kind of get the feeling that Pence is trying to position himself as the GOP candidate in the next election. it sort of seems that by then trump will have completely worn out his welcome and Pence could brand himself as the reason trumps second term was so much worse than his first term.,LanceThunder,2025-05-06T11:22:56,14
Pence just realized trump has pulled him as far as he can get him. now Trump can only pull him down.,Spoztoast,2025-05-06T11:39:40,4
Something about having one’s life threatened might change a person’s perspective.,migrainingms,2025-05-06T12:11:44,5
Pence only turned against Trump when it was clear that he was never going to have a career again.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-06T12:42:20,3
Probably had an awakening when Trump supporters were chanting 'Hang Mike Pence'. Probably the biggest wake up call you could get.,Dogscannotwearsocks,2025-05-06T16:10:38,2

"If New England was carved out of the US and declared a separate nation, would it be unnatural for the US to still want it under its influence?",warmike_1,2025-05-06T12:54:11,-1
"It's because he no longer has power, and only because of that, that Pence is starting to speak out against Trump. Now that he has nothing to gain from kissing his ass, he's finally proclaiming the obvious reality he's known full well for years. Fucking bunch of hypocrites.",bi7worker,2025-05-06T14:19:57,3
Actually... he the guy responsible for not letting trump stay in power during Jan 6 riot. He stayed and made the transfer of power happened.,pickus_dickus,2025-05-06T05:31:51,55
This would be absolutely hilarious if true!,bakerfredricka,2025-05-06T13:19:22,1
Don’t forget the 5 second clip of Pence alone in a room with a woman before ‘mother’ turns the corner and joins them!,thisusedyet,2025-05-06T23:27:39,1
His refusal on January 6th to play along with Trump's coup was not bravery. It was the bare minimum of his fucking job.,Schiffy94,2025-05-06T10:57:04,3
"Exactly, this is less than the bare minimum.",The_Poster_Nutbag,2025-05-06T16:53:23,7
I think he could make an argument for that. He seems to have been one of the grownups in the room during the first term.,LookOverall,2025-05-06T11:27:02,7

I mean he was still a homophobic anti-science misogynist.  It's just the bar has been lowered tremendously.  Sort of like how George W. Bush looks like a fucking genius these days because he actually believed in US AID.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-06T12:43:10,17
"In public, he was a lock-step toady right up until Jan 6. He might try to make a case for doing work behind the scenes, but I can’t imagine what that would be. He’s a spineless worm and a bigot.  Then again, conservatives will believe whatever a conservative with power tells them to believe, so I’m sure it will work great.",veryverythrowaway,2025-05-06T13:30:26,3

"Whilst true, it's also important to remember that this wasn't just a guy 'doing his job'. There were tens of millions enraged, an ongoing attempted coup and what I can only imagine was insane political pressure. I have absolutely no doubt there would've been many who cracked under that pressure and fear.",PM_ME_UR_VULVASAUR_,2025-05-06T11:10:11,2
"You make a good point. I don’t really care for Pence, but I respect his moral code on that occasion and can recognize it required fortitude at the time to make. It doesn’t absolve his other shortcomings, but believe it or not, there is nuance to every human and he made a ‘good human’ move there.  Queue up the Reddit mob to post out every grievance he committed prior to that and pat eachother on the back with snarky comments and goofy upvotes from here though.",Not-Banksy,2025-05-06T22:42:35,2
