"It's an inconvenient truth, they don't care about the future of the planet or even their own grandchildren.  It's less money for the fossil fuel companies and fracking and etc.  It's all about the Benjamins.  They don't care so they say it's a hoax or the science is wrong.  We are lucky we fixed the ozone layer while we weren't is sh@t town yet.  Now it's who can become the richest billionaire and avoid taxes.",crosstheroom,2025-04-07T16:21:57,1

"Otherwise people would want mass transit or figure out ways to stop using cars so much  And like four people own the entire supply chain of car maintenance and will lose billions of we stop driving cars  like seriouslly, the koch brothers literally bought text book companies, changed climate change to a beliefe system, and then lobbied florida law to allow these text books. So now florida is all 'science is fake' in their classrooms....all so people drive cars more.   If you get stuck in commutes, thank that",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-07T16:24:53,1

I don’t understand how some people can say “yeah well some climate scientists say climate change doesn’t exist”.  Like… okay so you BELIEVE what climate scientists have to say… just the 1% that are wrong? I don’t get it.,Zealousideal_Bad_922,2025-04-07T16:33:17,1
"This interview notes that scientists have been warning about climate change impacts since the 1950s, but ""despite this early evidence, public understanding of climate science has long been obscured by a decades-long campaign of disinformation orchestrated by the fossil fuel industry.""  Comparing the climate change debate with past struggles over disinformation, such as with tobacco, the interview focuses on the EPA endangerment finding, which is of utmost importance but not well known by Americans.  >So I think it’s very important for the American people to understand that this really is settled science. We know that the Earth is warming because of human activities as well as we know that there’s gravity, as well as we know that DNA carries hereditary information. This is very well-established science.  >\[Another reason concerns\] the legal context as we fight for policy actions. We’re seeing the EPA endangerment finding is now being endangered, and as we have to fight for action on this issue, one of the questions that comes up is, “What is the legal basis for action about climate change?” And my group has done some work on the history of the Clean Air Act. There have been debates both in Congress and in the courts about whether or not the Clean Air Act applies to carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.  [https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/our-elected-officials-have-known-about-climate-change-since-the-60s/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/our-elected-officials-have-known-about-climate-change-since-the-60s/)  Released in 2009, the EPA's endangerment finding has been considered the ""holy grail"" of climate change regulation, and Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced an attempt to dismantle it.  >The agency at the center of federal climate action said it would roll back bedrock scientific findings, kill climate rules, terminate grants that are already under contract, and change how it collects and uses greenhouse gas data. Taken together, the plans would effectively remove EPA from addressing climate change at a time when global temperatures have soared to heights never experienced by humans.  [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-epa-unveils-aggressive-plans-to-dismantle-climate-regulation/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-epa-unveils-aggressive-plans-to-dismantle-climate-regulation/)  >Now the EPA, under Donald Trump, is trying to undo its own authority to take that action.   >EPA administrator Lee Zeldin [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-kicks-formal-reconsideration-endangerment-finding-agency-partners) Wednesday that the agency will undertake a “formal reconsideration” of its 2009 endangerment finding, which underpins the agency’s legal obligation to regulate carbon dioxide and other climate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also announced that it intends to undo all of its prior rules that flow from that finding, including limits on emissions from automobiles and power plants alongside scores of other rules pertaining to air and water pollution.    >“Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the **climate change religion**, \[BF added\]” Zeldin [said](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history).   [https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/epa-endangerment-finding-trump-zeldin-tries-to-torpedo-greenhouse-gases](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/epa-endangerment-finding-trump-zeldin-tries-to-torpedo-greenhouse-gases)  S/b ""climate change science"" if Zeldin had been honest IMO.",BuckeyeReason,2025-04-07T16:20:00,1

It’s the same reason as always money. Special interests all pay politicians off to undermine any real efforts to limit climate change  iniative because their ability to pollute is tied to profit.,megaben20,2025-04-07T16:22:30,1
Because it will cost them money.  The pursuit of money releases dopamine.  So doing anything that results in that not happening is bad.  We have to cost them more money through bigger social cost.  Get them focusing on bigger costs and thus they earn less money.   Notice no one is getting rid of plastic made with oil.  So we need to require them to pay the cost to recycle their packaging up front and watch every company aim to make that cheaper be it through easier to recycle plastics or changing materials or giving back a deposit to reuse what they provide.,flyingemberKC,2025-04-07T16:51:21,1

Consolidate wealth into the hands of themselves and their progeny to maximize their chances of survival when shit hits the fan without getting the rest of us into a panic trying to do the same thing.

"Because science is hard and vibe is easy.    Donald Trump knows that vibe is more important than science.   It's also cheaper.    That's why he has not only cut funding for environmental protection and canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of green energy grants, but he has also opened up half of our national forests to logging because, as Ronald Reagan explained decades ago, trees cause pollution.   Extinction Rebellion had their chance a few years ago to make their case to the American people. They blew it.    But look at the bright side; once temperatures have risen a bit more and the ice has all melted and the Americans have taken over Greenland and divided it up among real estate speculators, they'll be some fantastic beach resorts up there.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T17:43:23,1
"Doing the right thing is more expensive than doing the wrong thing. There's a reason governments need to regulate businesses.

I find it funny when the young corrupt assholes try playing up the climate change hoax tactic the old corrupt assholes are to get more money.

It isn’t just cars. It’s also power generation in general. Moving off of coal and oil for power would hurt people like the Koch bros just as much as moving away from cars. Moving away from cars isn’t even as essential anymore if we move more people to EVs and have cleaner burning power to charge those EVs.,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-07T16:32:27,1
