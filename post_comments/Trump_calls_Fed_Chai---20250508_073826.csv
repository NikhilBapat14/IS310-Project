"This proves that Trump has no idea what's really going on in the USA. He has his sycophants telling him that everything is fine, prices are going down, people are happy, and he parrots that lie and uses it to set policy. Meanwhile, in real life, shit's about to break and Powell knows it.   We are a ship with a madman at the helm.",DoomOne,2025-05-08T07:51:13,48

"President Donald Trump derided Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell once again Thursday, a day after the central bank voted to not lower rates because of economic uncertainty created by tariffs.  Trump said in a Truth Social post: ″‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much! Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and “eggs”) down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S. — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF “TOO LATE!” ENJOY!”  The Fed on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it’s kept the range in the three meetings this year since last cutting in December. This has frustrated the president, who wants the central bank to cut rates to counter a possible slowing economy due to the rollout of his trade policies.
