"> Until the DOGE takeover, which culminated in U.S. Marshals ordering building security to let Trump administration officials in, the agency was led by CEO Travis Adkins, who arrived in 2021 after a short stint as a Biden appointee at USAID. An assistant to Adkins said after she asked why her paycheck was lower than agreed upon, Adkins informed her that the remainder would be coming from an overseas account.  > He “sent me an email connecting me with this guy in Africa who asked for my banking information. Within a few days this guy wired me $17,000,” she told The Daily Wire on condition of anonymity. The Daily Wire reviewed bank paperwork showing the transfer from an account in Kenya.  > Another longtime employee, she said, was eventually “put on the payroll of an African partner and was informed she was being paid through an entity in Mauritania. No payroll, state or federal taxes were withheld from her paychecks.”",zroxx2,2025-05-08T07:59:51,4
Anything like this needs to be put out there on a national barony Trump with all the receipts. If it needs to be a two hour congressional address or not it needs to all be thrown out there. Make congress have to answer for it.  No names just the info.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-08T08:25:02,4
"Congress doesn't need to answer for it, this was a crime perpetrated by those involved.  Pam Bondi needs to be working on indictments and issuing arrest warrants.  Congress can legally be as stupid as they want in appropriating money.  They could possibly be dinged for not exercising appropriate oversight through the Inspector General Office.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-08T08:53:44,2
Congress is supposed to have oversight of many of the agencies and organizations. By answering for it that means doing there jobs with passing budgets to prevent piles of money just given to some agency and letting them decide what they do with it. If Trump addresses congress it’s going to make news. If Trump has the receipts then so does the DOJ.  Are you aware that there are a lot of people don’t know what DOGE uncovered with USAID. People think they are closing down vaccination programs and foreign health clinics. Put the info out there so the press can’t spin their own agenda.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-08T09:00:01,0
