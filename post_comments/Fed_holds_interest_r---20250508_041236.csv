"That's right, Powell, do what economic conditions dictate, not the Bankruptcy King.  Let Trump FINALLY take responsibility for tanking US markets ALL BY HIMSELF.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T04:42:26,26
If you saw the presser I saw I don’t think we have to worry about JPow feeling any pressure. Bro was cold as ICE. Down right frosty!,Onyxfaeri,2025-05-08T05:08:45,10
Lols. UK just dropped ours by a quarter percent.,VogonSoup,2025-05-08T06:06:05,5
I wish he'd drop them half a percent. The Fed is slightly biased towards fighting inflation at the expense of raising employment.    Housing supply would improve. Investments in new green tech would improve. The resistance of banks to sudden stress and collapse would improve. Job openings would improve. With lower interest rates.    And we should be targeting 3% inflation not 2%. I've thought this from way before Trump seemed at all likely to win in 2024 let alone won it.  ,Voaracious,2025-05-08T04:59:54,-9
Holding the interest rates where they are has strengthed the dollar (so far).  Which will help offset some of the losses suffered since Trump enacted his tariffs. And that can help keep the prices of imported goods from rising as much.,Joadzilla,2025-05-08T06:00:07,5
