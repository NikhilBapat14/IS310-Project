Think about how easily gore would have won if Nader didn't peel 100k votes in Florida.  Think about how differently our national conversation could have been.    The reason you think the choice is right wing vs centrist is because of this.  Yes obviously the dnc has been shitting the bed,  but a third of the country consistently not voting,  many of whom are left of the current conversation is a huge contributor as well, which is my point.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-30T09:53:55,1

"How does that track when they’re shifting right when they’re supported and when they’re not? Your vote isn’t what stops the shift when they’re answering to their donors first and foremost.   You vote for them and you signal there’s nothing to change. I mean you voted for it, you can’t be that opposed to it, not opposed to the point of not voting. Than if you don’t vote they’ll take it as they didn’t go right enough since you didn’t support their gracious grift for the progressive movement.   They see what they want to see and their answer will be to satisfy their donors, even if it means losing an election. After all, upwards of half of them are okay with advancing trumps agenda, where their voting record reflects that.",F1shB0wl816,2025-04-30T05:43:33,1

If they wouldn’t make the immediate choice, America’s people should’ve stepped up and bit the bullet that would’ve been a “normal” but non-people-favoriting democrat, as opposed to ***this***.  This is ridiculous. If any of you choose not to vote next time, you deserve what’s coming just as much as those who voted for Trump.",EpsilonX029,2025-04-30T07:20:44,4
"I don't quite follow, but I believe you are asking how you send a signal while also voting to avoid sliding right?    The answer would be you vote for the direction you want the party to go in the primary (don't get me started on the dnc fucking up primaries since 08, I can have issues with 2 groups, the dnc is a huge problem) and then vote to avoid the worse candidate in the general (you might notice this is something Republicans are excellent at, that's my point)   Progressives and especially young people being an unreliable voting bloc is what causes the democrats to have to play in the middle to peel moderates,  which causes progressives to view the candidates as unpalatable which fuels the proper sentiment.   All the while conservatives show up every time rain or snow.     If we had something like the aus system where you'd get fined for not voting,  and we had better turnout and less protest voting in the general... well shit we'd be in a completely different country right? That's my point.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-30T10:01:30,0
Sure but there were still primaries.   Bernie didn’t get more votes than Hillary regardless of superdelegates and Yes Biden played political games but the same that all politicians do. I don’t think the whole argument of someone further left would have won if just the moderates kept splitting their votes between several ppl is a good one to make. It doesn’t show the left wing as very strong if they need vote splitting to win.   I say this as someone who voted for Bernie in both of these primaries.   The DNC didn’t force either candidate on us. If people had cared enough and showed up in the primaries we’d have had a further left candidate. People just don’t care. It’s frustrating as hell but that’s the big problem here. Not Biden convincing some fellow moderates to drop out.   To be clear I’m fine with complaints about those things. Just it’s not the same as the party leadership forcing people on us. The primary voters still voted and they didn’t vote for the more progressive candidates,iclimbnaked,2025-04-30T10:50:43,0
"Politically disenfranchising swaths of traditional dem voters(youth, anti war, muslim, working class et al.) is just as effective at electing Trump as not voting at all.   This Morning-Joe-brain-pilled take some liberals have of ""they get what they deserve"" is just more dirt to bury ourselves with. We need more votes and less undeserved, ignominious self-righteousness.",Rick_McCrawfordler,2025-04-30T08:57:09,4
"You’re making a big assumption with me. I as well as everyone in my circle does vote.   You’re right it could have been avoided. You know, by actually taking the election seriously enough to have a candidate by the primaries. We also always bite the bullet because “it’s never the time” for ideals. Just so we can be gaslit that Biden was the most progressive candidate the worlds seen. It’s telling that the people who support the status quo and is telling others to get uncomfortable.   If Dems repeat last year than it’s clear they, both the politicians and the voters didn’t learn and deserve every bit as much. But let’s be real, they deserve it today because this shit was obvious years ago but you and your like minded countrymen wanted to bury your head to the obvious. That’s what’s really ridiculous.",F1shB0wl816,2025-04-30T10:06:48,3
"Primary? You mean that thing they weren’t even prepared for in the most important election according to them? Just one of many of the DNCs fucked examples of primaries.   They’re unreliable exactly because of what you’re saying. They’re wishy washy, they’ll quickly flip to fascist if it means a potential win like a tour with Cheney.  It’s clear to anyone with half a brain cell that their progressive stances are nothing more than token phrases used to manipulate those very voters. It’s not genuine and you can see right through it.   You can’t expect people to turn out when you have no conviction in what you’re even saying. Which the party doesn’t when it comes to anything progressive, it’s the one thing the party will get behind. They’ll maliciously oppose their own party members before they even symbolically stand up to fascist.   Your solution just sounds like it forces everyone to back a weak or dead horse instead of actually addressing the issue that the DNC isn’t beholden to their voters. You’re little vote isn’t shit when their looking for the voice of greenbacks coming from their donors.  And their donors say “slide right.” So they do, happily. Even when it cost an election because they’re not here to win elections, they’re here to represent their donors. I have no illusions there right sliding bullshit will let up until the moneys cleaned up, votes and democracy be damned. That’s the point.",F1shB0wl816,2025-04-30T10:17:43,1
"First,  if you read what I wrote you'd see I'm no fan of the dnc.  That doesn't absolve you if you're civic duty to vote.    Second,  the results of your actions are clear,  we have destroyed the economy and are building a police state. If you cannot see how refusing to vote for centrist candidates leads to extreme candidates opposite the direction you'd like,  I don't know what to tell you,  it is literally happening before our eyes.   Like I said,  this type of thinking directly led to bush 2 via Nader siphoning 100k votes in Florida from gore.  And now Bush 2 is regularly called a rino.    How possibly will citizens united get fixed if you don't vote for centrists and let extremists win,  you are failing to see past your nose. Which again,  is my point.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-30T13:20:24,-1
"There is no such thing as civic duty. We know this, we experience it every time. You know people aren’t going to show up for a lacking candidate, if you want a turn out you need to do something to get it other than whisper sweet nothings about civic duty.   For your 2nd point, you seem to be forgetting the very same “centrist” Dems, in all reality they’re just closeted republicans, are the same ones who decided to not hold trump accountable or take his candidacy seriously, just like 2016. It literally happened before your eyes. Biden was voted in to bring justice and he brought his donors what they wanted, not the voters.   Now that same centrist platform isn’t even opposing trump. They’re confirming his picks, they’re voting in support of his bills and the only thing they’re targeting is real leftist who are speaking out.   Your type of thinking directly leads to Dino candidates with weak platforms. Decades of it by your own examples. How is it going over your head?   Until those “centrist” are willing to get uncomfortable, that’s not going to change. Voting and supporting their positions will do anything but change them and if they’re not willing to slide left in the face of fascism than they were never going to go left out of good faith.   I harbor no illusions citizens United will be overturned. Clearly I think what voters want is irrelevant and 2nd to donor dollars but I’ll state that again.   You know how you’d be happy to tell me “now’s not the time for ideals.” Well now’s not the time for your ideals, ideals that uphold a non functioning status quo. Until you’re ready to sing a different tune, enjoy what’s coming.   And I do vote. Everytime, I never leave a chance to leave work early on the table. It’s telling that everytime I’ve made this point over the years I’m just deemed a non voter by people unwillingly to look inwards at the problem they’re supporting.   Thats the point.",F1shB0wl816,2025-04-30T15:12:42,1

"You’ve read my point. I know I sure as fuck won’t be voting for a spineless, middle of the road democrat again. First for everything and if that’s who Dems go with and likely will, you’ll find yourself here again in a few years blaming everyone else.   Hell when it comes to the election the most progressive candidate probably isn’t even the democrat party. Do you actually mean what you say and you’ll vote third party or is “most progressive” just a qualifier for Dems and republicans with no regards to a third party? Because if so you’re not voting for the most progressive candidate, you’re voting blue no matter who which is a terrible strategy when it comes to change.",F1shB0wl816,2025-05-01T05:20:27,1
"Most progressive candidate that can win is what i said.  So no. I don't vote third party because that's throwing my vote away,  I vote progressively in primaries.     Sitting out is effectively a vote for the party you are least aligned to.  And you are the guy saying I was wrong to assume you don't vote and then you tell me you won't vote if the candidate fails your purity test?  Ok.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-05-01T10:04:53,0
"“Chance to win” is actually what you said, any candidate on that ticket has the chance to win. So no, you don’t actually vote for the most progressive candidate, you’re just voting for the most “centrist” pick because you want to play team sports instead of elect good candidates.   Throw away your vote according to who? The democratic leaders who don’t want to change. That’s convenient.   No, sitting out is not an “effective vote for the party you’re least aligned with.” That’s just more dnc bullshit. If you actually believed that than what do you have to say for the 170 million Americans not voting for Dems, and their complete inability to target those voters?   Yeah, I said I won’t vote for *them*. So what? You’re projecting your beliefs on to me as if I only have 2 choices. Purity test?

No,  third party candidates on presidential ballots do not have a chance to win and it's well documented they are funded by our enemies to peel votes.    Tell me, how effective was a vote for Nader in Florida in 2000?  Those 100k folks voted for Bush 2, you continuing to argue otherwise is naive.  Bush ""won"" by a few hundred votes.  Those votes for Nader were wasted,  that's all there is to say.   We both agree the rules are fucked,  you're just throwing a tantrum while I'm trying to push the needle in the direction I want it to go in the system we currently have.  That's all it is.

It’s kind of cute that you, the repeated loser thinks they have something to say about winning.   You’re just blue maga. No critical thinking, no policies that actually better lives. Nothing to vote for that’s not built off the fear that’ll be worst otherwise.   You’re just proving your point that you’re just selfish team players. You’re pissing away good candidates because you want to risk it on a lame sack of shit who’s wearing the right jersey.   I’m throwing a tantrum?

You’re just the toddler who’s thrown themselves on the ground.   “I’m no shill” says the guy who supports their candidate, their policies and their inevitable results. The guy who refuses to look inwards or look for other options. You’re as much of a shill as can be without directly asking for the money.

"Where did I say you’re an enemy? I said you’re not an ally, I can’t count on you to actually support good candidates because you care more about winning with a loser than losing with a winner. You’re not risking anything, you’re not sacrificing, you’re not compromising. You’re just enabling them to slide further right, which they have consistently done year after year.   It’s not because of people like me and my criticism. It’s because people like you circle jerk each other into making it a team sport, doing the same thing the people you’ve deemed an enemy do. You’re creating and sustaining a self fulfilling prophecy, you won’t ever vote 3rd party, you tell others not to. Nobody on the team wants to take that first step so you create a loss. Third party candidates don’t make ground because 70 million people delude themselves into playing the DNCs hand.   Why would I want to sustain the system as it currently exist? Like you’re not getting it. What exist doesn’t work, even when democrats have a trifecta. Micro, macro, it doesn’t matter, the only people who consistently come out ahead is the donor class whose plants you inevitably support because they’re wearing the “right” jersey.   The system that currently exist does allow me to vote outside of the two main parties. An ability I’m taking advantage of until democrats do something worthy of my support. Want my vote?
