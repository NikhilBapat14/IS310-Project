No they don’t. Another lie,TheWorldBeyond11,2025-04-25T06:48:02,13
"Like he said the deal was ‘close,’ how many times now?  Just FYI, the deal he made with his ghostwriter for The Art of the Deal was widely believed at the time to be the poorest in publishing history.",AINonsense,2025-04-25T06:44:51,6
"Sure, if the ""deal"" is ""this is mine now"".  Trump is desperate for something - anything - he can attach his name to.  Russia knows this.",Deguilded,2025-04-25T06:59:08,3
Like how shoplifting is just a really bad deal for the store.,30mil,2025-04-25T06:49:47,3
It is about as likely as those China tarrif talks he had with Xi yesterday morning.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-25T07:56:05,2
Is this deal in room with us like his calls with Xi?,Sol0botmate,2025-04-25T08:42:32,2
"they want that deal trump proposed.  thats why they bombed kiev after zelensky said no.  to say this is your fault.  if you keep refusing, you get the bombs.",VOIDsama,2025-04-25T07:12:00,1
"No they do, because Trump is only going to propose a deal that Russia ‘finds acceptable’ and they know it. Full acceptance of Crimea and the Donbas region becoming legally Russian territory, no troops in Ukraine, Ukraine banned from accepting foreign military aid and from ever joining NATO, basically whatever Russia wants.  Then when Ukraine naturally calls it bullshit and refuses, Trump walks away from it all saying he had a fair deal on the table but Zelenskyy is a dick, and Russia goes off saying ‘we were ready to accept a fair peace but crazy Nazi Ukraine just loves war so here we go again’",Drolb,2025-04-25T07:07:34,3
"This isn't so much a hypothetical as what they've tried a few times.  So far, Ukraine just goes, ""Lol. No.""  Russia has also turned down some because they assume they'll get everything.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-25T08:29:19,1
I really hope Ukraine and European support hold out. You know the Russian economy is going to collapse soon.,whatisboom,2025-04-25T17:57:47,1
