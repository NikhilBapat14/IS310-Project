"Am I the only one shocked that he didn't somehow in the middle of that either break down and talk badly about the Church or that he didn't take credit for it.  I am sure follow-up tweets will have him taking credit for being President for the first American born Pope.  Oh god, I just realized his fanatics are going to say he is responsible and that this is more proof of Trump's godliness. Argh... I just depressed myself.",ImmoKnight,2025-05-08T14:54:09,8

I'm sure he'll get mad and encourage his deplorable to send death threats soon enough. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-08T15:14:53,1
I bet you’re right. They’re so insufferable already,Sheldraker,2025-05-08T14:57:03,3
He's probably upset that he wasn't elected Pope.,cliff99,2025-05-08T15:24:46,1
I’m guessing the orange hasn’t heard that yet or he’d be blowing up social media with word vomit about how awful the church is.,sadetheruiner,2025-05-08T15:23:16,1
