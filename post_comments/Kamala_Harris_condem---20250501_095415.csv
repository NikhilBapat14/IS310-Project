We did that already. 90 million sat out the election. We need voters that sat out. We existing voters will vote the same. We need MORE voters. Hint: They may not be corporate loving or centered in their views.,williamgman,2025-05-01T10:59:05,12

"He also, y'know, staged a violent coup, and then Biden and Harris let him get away with it, which is why we are in this mess to begin with, so she can just fuck right off. ",Bakedads,2025-05-01T09:56:58,9
I think she should step aside. Someone else from the party should be taking up the leadership role and speak up.,nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-01T11:10:30,6
"We gave her over a *billion dollars* to beat trump, the largest political war chest this nation has ever seen, and she spent it on… anti immigration ads  She’s the absolute *last* person we need leading the charge",Duke-of-Dogs,2025-05-01T13:41:15,2
"""Kamala Harris condemns Trump's first 100 days, calling on Democrats to band together | The former vice president panned Trump's agenda, saying he pulled America to the brink of a constitutional crisis, devastated the economy and abandoned world allies.""  The Kamala rehabilitation tour rolls on. Look for the corpoDems to pick her in 2028 against whichever domestic terrorist the party of domestic terrorism chooses, possibly hillbilly Vance.  That's assuming that the convicted felon and lifelong sexual predator currently occupying the oval office doesn't muster up another insurrection and keep squatting there. With help from SCOTUS, of course. It's only another half step after their **Trump v. Anderson** blowjob on the US Constitution.",keninsd,2025-05-01T10:16:33,3
"I won't vote for Kamala in a primary. She's too conservative for me.  America needs an FDR type Democratic party. There's a reason he won 4 elections.     America is falling behind the world in secondary or higher education, not just college, but in trades as well. Shortages in these areas are getting worse, in fact, it will soon become a crisis. Republican’s anti-immigration laws are decreasing the availability of qualified professionals and workers even more. Those most effected are “unskilled labor,” Republicans are also targeting physicians and STEM workers. As a result, immigrants are turning away from America at a rapid pace and they may never feel safe to return and lay roots in a country that could turn on them from one election to the next. Immigrants are leaving their country for stability, so why would they want to come to America where they can be sent to a random concentration camp in yet another country? But does America really need to search for immigrants to fill higher skilled jobs when it has so much untapped talent and potential right here at home?

…by having the promised one term Biden who was elected to prevent this from happening but instead he ran for two terms and then handed a nomination to Harris without a primary? Yeah screw her!,devadander23,2025-05-01T10:06:49,2

"lol. You expect the sitting VP to undermine the president and go against the entire party? Ok. Biden shouldn’t have ran for a second term. Not because of the ‘dementia’ but because that was his 2020 campaign. But Harris doesn’t have control over Biden’s decision to break his campaign promise, nor did she have control over him breaking his other campaign promise by appointing the weak AG and slow rolling justice. Also isn’t her fault he then left the candidacy too late for the party to have primaries. Not her fault as VP she got the nomination from her party.   But please continue to blame her. Lofty standards are what got us here",devadander23,2025-05-01T16:19:22,4

"People take responsibility for their own conduct. Once she was designated to run and questions raised about what she could do different than the Biden administration, the idiot could not come with a damn thing. Much could have been said without disrespect towards Biden. Democrats wanted change!  That sealed her fate, and she never recovered from it. She no longer has any credibility for me. She had many other opportunities to make distinctions between herself and Biden, she failed time and again at each one of those events.   Even the media had more credibility than her and that is saying a lot.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-01T18:05:19,-3
"When we’re barreling towards the most important election in living memory with democracy itself on the line and “undermining” the president means acknowledging his clearly visibly physical decline (after he ran on a one term platform), YES. I would expect it and ANYONE loyal to policy over their party would expect the same. That’s what any GOOD leader would do.   Isn’t hindsight supposed to be 20/20? We *absolutely* should have had a primary and it’s mind blowing that people like yourself are still wasting your breath and energy defending Harris as a candidate",Duke-of-Dogs,2025-05-01T16:36:08,-4

"I recall a townhall event during the campaign where trump *swayed to music* instead of answering questions for well over 20 minutes.  He types nonsense in the middle of the night, exactly like an old man with Alzheimer's who is sundowning. When he speaks, it's made up words, misused words and general word salad. And still, not a peep said.",green-wagon,2025-05-01T20:58:59,-2
A peep from who? Me and virtually everyone I know have been calling trump an incompetent boob for the better part of a decade.   Trump being shit doesn’t make Biden more capable and it didn’t make Harris more electable,Duke-of-Dogs,2025-05-01T22:15:34,0
