The stuff on the shelves in two weeks was ordered 6 months ago. Things he does now will affect the shelves in two weeks only if it is about turning ships back at the port.

It will be loaded in ships in august and be on shelves in October November. People negotiating prices today have no idea what the tariff rate will be when it goes through customs in September.

Can't find my comment to source it, but it was essentially telling people that companies were holding out on reordering items, and using up existing inventory. They already have targets to achieve and paying 100%+ more for an item is not included.  Companies were betting on trumps sporadic behavior that its cheaper to use existing products in their warehouses and wait until trump removes the tariffs.   If I had to reorder 600k worth of goods, I'm not paying 1.2mil with tariffs when I bet the president will change his mind in a week. Wait until tariffs removed, and then reorder. It's either empty shelves until they can restock at lower prices, or they give in a restock at a huge increase on sticker price.   What's happening here is we're all in deep shit because he's not budging. He's not being reasonable. The tariffs are still extremely high and existing products in warehouses are running out.

"It takes about 3-6 weeks for a contain ship to cross the ocean from China to the USA.  So even if he dropped the tariffs right now, by the time the Chinese factory receives the order and fires up the machinery, then gets it to the docks and on a vessel, then the vessel has to cross the ocean, then it needs to be driven from the port to the warehouse, and from the warehouse to the store, you're talking about a month on the inside.  And stores don't keep full warehouses anymore.  They rely on JIT, just in time shipping.  They've got at most a couple of weeks of product on hand. The pre-warning on the tariffs may have been the exception though, if they were smart they would have stocked up just before the tariffs came down.  But even so I can't see them having much more than a month's supply on hand.  So basically, May is screwed already, but if he drops the tariffs now then things will get better in June.  If he keeps them up until Fall then we're having a horrible Christmas season, and a ton of people will be losing their jobs as businesses die.
