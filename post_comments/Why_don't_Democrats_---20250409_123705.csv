Liberal thinkers go into academia.  Conservative thinkers go to think tanks.,AnotherTry1982,2025-04-09T12:54:06,143
"My two cents? Because one party is interested in governing, which requires at least a pinky-finger’s grip on reality. Think tanks that make up crap to muddy the water or promote their pet issue don’t work well with people like that.",HammondCheeseIII,2025-04-09T14:06:06,81
"Because we don’t have real community on the left. We’re a collection of different tribes that throw each other under the bus when the going gets tough, and we don’t seriously talk to each other. We don’t plan and organize as a collective against what we see as an existential threat. The right started this project in the 70s. Meanwhile we’ve just been playing “react” to whatever culture war narrative they’ve concocted ever since.",literatekinda,2025-04-09T13:28:22,74
"Republicans sat down years ago, and schemed about how to worm their way into school boards, local government and churches.    We need to do the same thing.  and it might take 20 years.  They played the long game, and are winning.  Maybe they've won, and Democrats will always be the minority going forward.  So we better start scheming for real, because taking the high road hasn't worked.  I'm not saying that we should give up our principals, but that we need a long term plan.",Broad_External7605,2025-04-09T13:09:06,22

"Brookings Institute and Center for American Progress are liberal think tanks, but they don't come up with ""master of the universe"" stuff like the right wing ones do.",OttersAreCute215,2025-04-09T14:30:27,6
Because we like going into knife fights with strongly worded emails.,Pop_Smoke,2025-04-09T18:16:49,3
I have been saying this for years! We need to be paying people to spread our ideology! We need to be infiltrating right leaning places and making ourself seem appealing to them.,Rosebunse,2025-04-09T18:57:04,3

"I do think we need think tanks that look into policies and propose better laws, regulations, and look for ways to make the government more efficient.  This is the kind of work I'd like to do.",davidellis23,2025-04-09T15:48:03,2
Nearly 100% of the differences between Rs and Ds come from the fact that Rs are extremely well funded by the rich people that benifit from their policies.,IIIaustin,2025-04-09T15:54:18,2
Because they labor under the self-delusion there are “guardrails” and “institutions” as if such things exist in a fascist dictatorship.,HaxanWriter,2025-04-09T16:04:07,2
"The left believed their ideas to be obviously better so they didn't try marketing them. The rich right finding these think tanks know that Democratic beliefs would be perceived as obviously better if Republicans don't make their ideas palatable with flowery language. That is why they invest so much into it. The white nationalists did the same thing with the ""alt right"" as a way to normalize white supremacy and come up with other ideas in their 4chan groups. This is something I desperately wish Democrats talked about. We discuss policies but never how to market them. If anyone could mod, a Democratic strategy sub would be truly incredible.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-09T16:25:27,2

"I absolutely agree!  About time.   This is coming from me a 57 year old lifetime progressive and over educated academic.  I read the comments here and the comments from people stating that democrats govern or democrats go to academia is bull shit.   The individuals who drafted Project 2025 are the same academics.  They are unified and have solidarity to their mission and no one here will be able to state they haven’t been wildly successful.  They are unified.     Democrats and progressives sitting in their ivory towers are exactly what the populace of America hates.   They hate me.  It is time to use the same tactics as maga and to have a think thank to address them in the same game.     What do you do in a progressive think tank?  You have multiple plans of attack, you use every tool available to intercept, impede, and destroy the enemy, you simulate plans and build contingencies, you manipulate, you develop progressive legislature and hand it verbatim to every state and local legislator to make into law.  We don’t do that.",cycleaccurate,2025-04-10T07:04:19,2

"And just a terrible instinct to attack each other instead of playing “yes, and!”, as the other person in your replies demonstrates.   E.g., when a small business owner says “wait, what’s this tariff charge on my invoice! Now I’m angry!”, it’s much better to say “yeah! These guys are incompetent! Look at the other bad stuff they’ve been doing!” than “screw you! You didn’t care when these other bad things happened!”",gringledoom,2025-04-09T13:50:25,27
Yes.  Always tough to keep democrats whole.  Agree.  The Right has been doing this a long time.  And they jump into forums pretending they're Left and rabble rouse.,Laura9624,2025-04-09T19:48:48,3

"Scheming to the lowest IQ voters usually requires playing fear tactics. They vilify immigrants, lgbtq, PoC, and taxes (saying democrats just want to give away your hard earned money). They sold their integrity and used lies to do it.   For us to get anywhere close to getting those low IQ voters we would need to separate ourself from all of that as well as coming up with a boogeyman they will hate more than us. Our “well actually” moments gets us laughed at. Facts don’t mean anything to them; only emotion and jump scares do.  Are we ready to sell our integrity and straight up lie and create hysteria for political power?",Bizlbop,2025-04-09T13:40:24,15

"back in the 1920s the left was pretty good at demonizing the rich, corporations and trusts.  Lots of rural folks backing the left at that point via the Grange and other progressive orgs. Plenty of racism and protectionism in there as well but there were the same groups the left could point at today.  Now the problem is today it takes so much money to run a national campaign its very difficult to demonize the same people you need to go hat in hand to for donations.",olcrazypete,2025-04-09T15:05:59,5
"I refuse to accept it has to be as you describe. I think we can effectively message without fear tactics. Using novel ways to reach people and make a point is worth thinking about. People can be reached emotionally in a lot of different ways. We haven't been trying anything, simply describe the thing that is apalling and expecting them to always reach the right conclusion while they are being fed propaganda is a bad approach.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-09T16:32:29,5
"I don't think having a smart, secret plan necessarily means dumping integrity.  It just means uniting business, cultural, and religious institutions.  If it is to create a more equitable, prosperous society, then I don't see a loss of integrity.

"We as a party were clearly stating that trumps tariff plan were going to be a disaster 6 months before the election. We had a letter signed by 29 Nobel prize winning economists saying such and it didn’t matter. The reward being “a good economy” which is the best carrot I can think of, didn’t mean shit to them. They were more worried about “immigrants and gays infiltrating our communities” than they were about their own pocket books.   When you look at history and see what motivators drove full nations together for a single event; almost always was it a “boogeyman”, followed distantly by “we want money.” People are drawn together by either outrage or greed; and outrage outranks greed in public elections.",Bizlbop,2025-04-09T16:41:33,1
"Oof, I’m gonna call out a couple things:   **For 1:**  >If it is to create a more equitable, prosperous society, then I don’t see a loss of integrity.    Is a very slippery slope to “laws don’t matter if it’s good for the county.”   **for 2:**   What will we use to motivate people coming together? Fear and selfishness are the two greatest motivators for political movements so if we aren’t going to manufacture a boogeyman like the republicans did then we will need one hell of a carrot. What can we *actually* offer? Because “a better economy” apparently isn’t the selling mark given this last election.   **and for 3:**   As someone in tech, hell has a better chance of freezing over than we do of seeing a major tech company move to rural red states. It simply will not happen.",Bizlbop,2025-04-09T15:06:38,5
How many Trump voters knew about that letter? How many Trump voters thought Trump would stink the economy? They just didn't believe he would act that stupidly. We could see the message wasn't reaching them and try a different tactic to make them lose faith. The problem is not the core of what we want but our ability to get that information to voters. They have no idea what Democrats want and think wrong things because they hear Republicans explaining Democrats and not Democrats.,Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-09T16:47:10,1
Wyoming is beautiful with sking and tons of outdoor activities.  There's already liberal. areas in Wyoming. It worked in Colorado.,Broad_External7605,2025-04-11T11:36:35,1
You’re proving my point: the republican messaging is that anything liberal is the boogeyman; the democrats messaging is “here’s how we make money.”   Now which one of those did I say outranks the other in my last comment?   Fact is: The boogeyman argument works so well that it set it up so that the other side can’t even get a word in.,Bizlbop,2025-04-09T16:59:25,1
"Colorados biggest economic drivers are   1. tourism,  2. aerospace (military and air force academy are out there),  3. and energy (oil and starting to be solar fields).   The biggest employer is the university of Colorado employing 36k people. Colorado was already set up more blue than Wyoming. For Wyoming or Idaho to become a Colorado 2.0 everyone in those states would have to vote and pass massive liberal legislation changes before any companies would plan to move there.   I’m honestly amazed at how dense/unrealistic you are being about this. This idea is a fantasy and the longer you argue for it the more I shake my head in disappointment about our party. That the democrats actually have people who think like this. Smdh….",Bizlbop,2025-04-11T11:42:40,1

"First, I'm wasn't being terribly serious, and I shake my head that you want to insult your fellow Democrat over this. You are providing an example of how Democrats are quick to call others stupid, and confirm the idea that Democrats are a bunch of smug, condescending  elitists.    1. Wyoming has tourism  2. 2 large military bases  3.  huge Geothermal potential  I thought of this When Google was looking for a place to build a large ""campus"".  Yes, they built/are building it in Boulder CO.    I'm sorry, but it made me think about what would have happened to Wyoming politically, if they had built it there.

Because they were told that liberal talking points were the boogeyman.    >We could see the message wasn’t reaching them and try a different tactic to make them lose faith.   **LIKE WHAT?!** Give me an idea that actually means something. Quit with these vague “wElL we cAn ThInK oF sOmEtHiNg”. Tell me the idea that the democrats missed. Because to me, getting 29 Nobel prize winning economists to write and sign a letter telling the public to vote blue is one of the ultimate moves we could to try and get their attention. Do you have anyone or any other group who deserves more respect than the *mostly conservative* economic legends that signed that letter?    >The problem is not the core of what we want but our ability to get that information to voters.

"They straight up didn't receive information at all from democrats. Republicans entered their zones and courted them and democrats didn't.   I can't explain this in a reddit post. It's more complicated than I care to put in the effort to write which is why I use vague terms and generalize. I'm going to give one example, not to say this is the way it should be done, but to display other tactics can be tried. Currently, Republicans use the influence that comes with being a US representative to go onto TV. Where they lie and spread propaganda. When pushed or fact checked by reporters they accuse them off being biased and political and no one counters that argument publicly. Viewers are left confused about what to believe and largely tune out. Democrats need to treat these Republicans not like US Representatives, but as lying corrupt hypocrites. Call out their tactics and refuse to engage with their framing of issues. Stop letting them frame the narratives in which we carry out debate. Different tactics is the first part of the equation. The second is going to more spaces, go wherever new media is going and try to reach people that don't follow the news. Go and talk straight with people and not like you message test everything you say.   Feel free to keep asking questions, I'll gladly get more specific, but explaining the tactics along with the reasoning of why they would work so you will believe me is not simple.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-09T22:07:29,1
