"It wasn't a failure; it created exactly what Musk wanted‚Äîchaos, so he could skirt regulators and sanctions.   He said it on Trump‚Äôs campaign trail; if Trump doesn't win, we‚Äôre going to prison.",profzoff,2025-04-30T18:47:43,100

Musk isn't really gone and his goons are most definitely still there.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-30T19:36:11,11
"This is one of the most insincere headlines I‚Äôve seen recently. Be suspicious of ‚Äòthedailybeast‚Äô manipulation. There are so many other reasons that Elon was ‚Äúremoved‚Äù, not because Trump finally understood economics or budgets. There are bad actors everywhere, trying to incite even more destruction.",sirchargeisfree,2025-04-30T19:27:00,10
Musk thinks that Tesla is failing because he's not able to spend enough time there while fucking up the federal government?   He's in for an extremely rude awakening.,DoomOne,2025-04-30T19:07:20,9
