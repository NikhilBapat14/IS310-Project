"Although many of the Project 2025 authors are veterans of the Trump administration, his campaign has [sought to distance itself from the project,](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/e008b76c-9f0e-408a-b73f-24735d234914) preferring to promote its own, far less detailed, [""Agenda47"" plan.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47)",nosecohn,2024-07-03T08:24:39,2
I have only ever heard non-Trump people talk about project 2025.,enemy884real,2024-07-05T13:44:04,2
It is a Democrat scare tactic. Just flat out lies being attributed to Trump.Â ,Teach11552,2024-07-08T06:32:58,1
Does this mean project 2025 wont happen under trump?,impost_,2024-07-03T11:37:09,1
"""Project 2025"" is the size of a phone book. I have a copy. Nearly 1,000 pages long, so to say it will or won't happen under Trump is not the right question. Certainly some of it will happen, the vast majority will not just because some of it is illegal, some of it takes longer than 4 years to accomplish, and much of it Trump just doesn't care about. The current Trump team hasn't been involved with Project 2025. It's really just a wish list of hyper conservatives, but Trump is a populist and his policy desires are flexible. For example he's become much less pro-life since Roe v Wade was overturned and his hand-picked candidates all got demolished in 2022, largely over abortion.",FiveDollarHoller,2024-07-06T12:02:55,2
