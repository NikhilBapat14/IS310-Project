"Spending causes a feedback loop. Pick and choose WHERE you spend money. You're going to have to buy stuff, and putting off purchases of goods or services that will make your life better and help others get money in their pockets to make their lives better helps nobody. Buy local or from businesses that don't align with the administration's goals whenever you can.   Vote with your wallet.

Yep. It‚Äôs really tough to escape that.  Save $5.00 a paycheck.  Never spend that unless it‚Äôs a life saving necessity.  It will add up. Even a little savings makes you feel better.,BudgetNoise1122,2025-04-03T14:52:44,8
"Find one thing to cut and save that.   Make things vs buy them, or barter.  Use buy nothing groups or freecycle.org  Use apps like Groupon, Honey, Ibotta, Gas Buddy, and Upside for cash back on what you already buy. If you use Credit Cards, then attach/use a good cash back card for those purchases and double-dip the savings.   Lots of budgeting info out there too.",ObligatoryID,2025-04-03T12:44:08,7

"I know how to budget, thanks. What I don‚Äôt know is why we suddenly think some kind of vague boycott (of what exactly? for how long? how do we measure success/failure?) is a better strategy than a workplace stoppage. Put another way, one in 10 U.S. workers already belong to a union; much of the organizational infrastructure is already there, and capable of being built out significantly (labor used to be much bigger, as we all know). Organizers know how to facilitate actions and get resources where they need to be in the event of a strike or similar action.
