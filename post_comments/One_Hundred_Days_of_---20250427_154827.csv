"""Ineptitude"" is putting it mildly  Government is in chaos with crazy policies that change daily like there's no master plan  Our enemies are now our ""friends"" while we treat our trusted Allies and Partners like enemies  Government Workers are being cast out along with their Departments & Agencies who provide the necessary checks and balances that make everything work  The economy is going down leaving businesses and us lost about what's coming next  The bottom line is the current leaders have zero accountability for anything and their leadership is all over the place with little to no consistency  The inmates aren't running the asylum ... they're creating it",OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-27T15:54:35,40
