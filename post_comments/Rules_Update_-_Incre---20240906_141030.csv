"How about the 2000 election? Florida flipped between red and blue several times between 6 PM on Election Day and the next day when we found out that Florida was going to decide the election but it would be weeks and weeks before Florida was called. I believe Florida was first called for Bush, Gore made the call conceding the race, then it was called for Gore before it was brought back to undecided. That election changed a lot about when and how TV networks call individual states and how they call the national race. For one thing, Florida is in 2 time zones, but they thought they had enough information even before the polls in the panhandle closed to call the state of Florida. Now it is strictly observed that the networks never call a state before all the polling places close. Even when itâ€™s a state that has gone for he same party for 20 years, they wait until the polls close.",Hazel1928,2024-09-06T21:09:46,1
