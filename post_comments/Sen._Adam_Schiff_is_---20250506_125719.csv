Nance pelosi protege mind you. And people dislike her even though she’s pretty experienced and passed many progressive policies ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-06T13:07:57,1

"> And people dislike her even though she’s pretty experienced  She lost the House twice in the middle of a democratic White House term, meaning there to help the economy recover the republican crashes but not in time to turn around and help the people....so we still have no public option, the minimum wage still at $7.25, marijuana still schedule I....",Agnos,2025-05-06T13:23:51,5
She got 81% in the last general and 73% in the last primary. Her lowest win since 2012 was the 2018 primary with 68%.   Not sure where you're getting the idea she's widely disliked.,Second_P,2025-05-06T13:31:24,-3
"The Republicans managing to turn the narrative that summer into ""death panels"" while in the last ten years they've done basically nothing but enact policies that have actually killed Americans is one of those mystifying things.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-06T13:44:33,2
> Not sure where you're getting the idea she's widely disliked.  She got 33.7% favorable rating to 52.7% unfavorable rating on the aggregate average on realclearpolitics.  https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/nancy_pelosi_favorableunfavorable-6673.html,Agnos,2025-05-06T13:41:23,-2
"Not sure what a national poll has to do with anything. She seems pretty popular in her district . The fact she's disliked by people in say Alabama, West Virginia, or Missouri isn't exactly important.",Second_P,2025-05-06T13:44:56,1
"> Not sure what a national poll has to do with anything  Not sure what country you are in, but here they do national polls to most national leaders, present and past...for example they still do favorability rating on Biden and Kamala Harris as you can see on the realclearpolitics link I posted above.",Agnos,2025-05-06T13:50:48,0

"Remind me when Pelosi ran a national campaign like Biden and Harris did?   See presidents are elected nationally, which Biden and Harris ran for, House seats are based on districts, neither Biden or Harris were even in the house, and Pelosi hasn't run a state wide campaign, let alone a national one.   Her polling on a national level is irrelevant, she's not going to run for president, she's stepped down a Dem House leader, and doesn't change the fact she wins elections easily.",Second_P,2025-05-06T13:58:23,1
"> Remind me when Pelosi ran a national campaign like Biden and Harris did?  If you live in another country you would not know that, but as Speaker of the House, Pelosi was third in position to become president if both the president and VP are incapacitated, on top of being a leader of the democratic party.  https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession  > Her polling on a national level is irrelevant  If you looked at the realclearpolitics link I posted above you will see the Biden and Harris were not the only ones, just the examples I gave...they also keep track of Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Kevin MCCarthy as they belive important to keep track of the favorability of the party leaders even if you think it is useless...",Agnos,2025-05-06T14:25:38,-1
"I don't follow why you keep asking what country I'm in since you're not following basic civics.   To make it easy President= National, House = District. Speaker = Members of the House. Her election performance, again for the House so her district, shows a very high level of support.  She hasn't been Speaker in years and won't be again, like ever.    Again, Pelosi isn't in a leadership position, isn't going to run for a leadership position, has never and will never run a national campaign. Did you have a gander at the dates of those polls? They're from 2022-2023 so obviously polling places don't care much how she's viewed nationally.",Second_P,2025-05-06T14:39:33,1
"> Did you have a gander at the dates of those polls? They're from 2022-2023  I see you are arguing in bad faith...here what you posted above:  > She got 81% in the last general and 73% in the last primary. Her lowest win since 2012 was the 2018 primary with 68%  You went back quite far to pull those numbers...proving nothing as those numbers may have drastically changed since  OP claimed ""And people dislike her"", never mentioning her district...even here in Michigan republicans tried to use her to smear the democratic candidate so yes, here favorability rating matters...",Agnos,2025-05-06T14:50:47,0
"Bad faith = reality?   I quoted the most important poll for a politician, election results (once again remember House = District). She got 81% in the most recent election, which goes allllllll the way back to November. I was showing how she is and has been rather popular in her district.   I'm still waiting to hear about Nancy's national campaigns, must have missed those. Or how it matters that she was third in line several years ago. Like no one really cares about the Senate Pro Tempore, such a daft rule that one.   Yeah, they use high profile politicians. Trump ran against a mixture of Kamala, Biden, Obama, AOC, and Sanders. Dems use MTG and the like when running regardless of the district.",Second_P,2025-05-06T15:00:24,1
