I'll take the silver lining here. Everyone else is recognizing that they're not immune from fascism. These elections absolutely would've gone the other way if Trump was half as crazy as he is.   Glad other people are waking up. ,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-03T12:55:42,70

"I look on America’s self inflicted wound with a mix of amazement and horror. To us, Trump is just another lying politician but one who can’t even form a coherent sentence or thought pattern when he speaks. He promises everything will be great but delivers a shit sandwich. The enthusiastic support he gets from his base even while they’re chowing down on that shit sandwich is truly mind boggling.",dutchroll0,2025-05-03T13:54:51,16

"I keep hearing American pundits blame the Dems and especially Harris’ campaign for the situation in the US, but frankly I can’t help but disbelieve in that narrative. Unless they did somehow succeed in rigging the election in Trump’s favor (as he recently bragged about) the American people had a value proposition in front of them: two human beings to run the country - Trump and Harris. If you chose Trump you were and are objectively wrong. You were either tricked or are too stupid to recognize that you went with the objectively inferior choice.   Your brain has evolved over eons to recogonize patterns and yours failed. Those who chose not to vote also failed to choose the objectively correct choice. The problem isn’t that the choices were both bad, the problem is the American people are too fucking stupid to choose the obviously less bad option. I’m glad to see that our Australian and Canadian neighbors are at least smart enough to make the correct choice after watching us fumble the ball so completely.",BallerBettas,2025-05-03T14:17:03,11

"It’s too bad Americans don’t have that kind of intelligence.   We’ve failed to vote against the GOP for decades.   We voted this clown into office twice.  If the election were tomorrow, we would make the same mistakes.   We can talk about messed up the leadership is…but, the people of this country vote them into office. People stay home because they’re happy to see the other party lose.   It’s hard to have any sort of hope…on a logical level that something will change. We’re still arguing about the Civil War.

"I really hope this trend continues into the next few elections for these countries.  I'm Canadian so I'm in a place where the ruling party will have been around for almost a decade and a half until our next election.  We tend to flip to the other side of the aisle every decade.

"Garbage headline trying to make everything about Trump.  A small handful of voters may have switched votes based on Trump, but there's basically no evidence he had anything to do with it.  The Australian Liberals (conservatives) ran a terrible campaign based on fuel prices that were already coming down, increasing gas prices, an unpopular leader, and no positive messages or at least any that were getting through. The Australian Green party (far left) also did badly, some attribute to their stance on increasing taxes during a cost of living crisis which one Australian Labor party attributed as 'insane'.  Making this about Trump is absurd.",poster457,2025-05-04T02:03:13,2

"Let’s be clear about Canada, Conservatives received the largest popular vote share in Canada since the 80s.  Trump didn’t move people against the right, it forced the left to consolidate with centrists to avoid Conservatives.

"True but had it not been for Trump, I don’t think Carney would have eked out a win. He did energize people to vote, especially older voters who are more reliable than younger ones, who in this instance supported the conservatives. The fact that Carney crushed in Quebec even though he has zero ties to Quebec, unlike Trudeau, tells you that Trump did save the Liberals from a crushing defeat.   I’m pretty sure that many of Poilievre’s voters were voting mainly for change rather than conservative ideals per se. So the combination of Trump threatening Canada and Trudeau resigning did avert a conservative landslide of epic proportions. People forget but the polling last year had the Liberals go from barely maintaining their official party status to go from to having a strong minority, only three seats from a majority, and Poilievre losing his own seat. This is nothing short of a political miracle. The conservative performance was not as groundbreaking as advertised. It was just a tiny wave of what should have been a conservative tsunami.",Lunarmeric,2025-05-04T07:50:52,1
Have you not seen the graphs completely shifting the outcome of the election once Carney was nominated and Trump kept up with his 51st state yapping? I think Trump was the major factor as to how the Conservatives had the biggest election bag fumble in history.,7footPenguin,2025-05-03T13:26:34,8
"Eh, partially. Dutton ran on Trump-lite when he saw it won in the US, but Albo and the ALP timed it perfectly for when Trump’s actions soured even the conservatives in Australia, making it a noose for Dutton.   Without that, I reckon it’d be a Labor minority as either way the Lib’s had absolutely no policy worth the paper it was written on, but a majority was brought about by all this geopolitical tension for sure.",StolenBob,2025-05-04T08:49:41,4

"The UK's problems stem more from a dysfunctional labour party than anything attractive about conservatives. For the decade from gordon Brown to Jeremy Corbyn you had a lot of in-fighting and image issues. When you don't have a strong opposition, the government can do whatever it wants. It's literally only the ineptitude of the Boris/Truss that gave them a chance tbh. The conservatives managed to out-dysfunction them in the end.",Ashen_Brad,2025-05-04T22:59:52,1
"I’m not arguing that Trump didn’t lead to a massive swing in the election towards Liberal, just that the headlines that are using the Canadian election as a sign of Trump’s ideas being rejected in other countries as disengenuous.  Plenty of Canadians were ready to give power to the Trump lite party instead of the one fighting for our sovereignty.",ragemaw999,2025-05-04T08:07:23,1
Voters didn't like Dutton and didn't like the lack of policy. The Trump thing was in the back of peoples minds but was not a reason to vote either way.,Vanga_Aground,2025-05-04T16:34:58,1
It’s not a rejection of conservative ideas per se because Trump doesn’t have a monopoly on conservatism. It’s just a rejection of Trumpism in general which is not synonymous with conservatism even if that does seem to be the case nowadays.,Lunarmeric,2025-05-04T08:11:02,1
