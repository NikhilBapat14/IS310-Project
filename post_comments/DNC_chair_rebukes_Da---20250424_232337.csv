The DNC, under Debbie's chairpersonship wasn't impartial though, it wasn't a ""whiff of impropriety"" as you put it; it was pretty blatantly partisan for Clinton.

That meant that other candidates like O'Malley and Sanders had way fewer opportunities to appeal to delegates and voters, and worked in Clinton's advantage.  And the damage was already done by the time Debbie stepped down, so it was mission accomplished for Clinton, which she ended up losing to trump anyway.

"Stop lying.  >Individuals who had maxed out their $2,700 contribution limit to the campaign could write an additional check for $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund—that figure represented $10,000 to each of the 32 states’ parties who were part of the Victory Fund agreement—$320,000—and $33,400 to the DNC. The money would be deposited in the states first, and transferred to the DNC shortly after that. Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state, but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.  >“Wait,” I said. “That victory fund was supposed to be for whoever was the nominee, and the state party races. You’re telling me that Hillary has been controlling it since before she got the nomination?”  >Gary said the campaign had to do it or the party would collapse.  >“That was the deal that Robby struck with Debbie,” he explained, referring to campaign manager Robby Mook. “It was to sustain the DNC. We sent the party nearly $20 million from September until the convention, and more to prepare for the election.”  >**Right around the time of the convention**, the leaked emails revealed Hillary’s campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races. A [Politico story published on May 2, 2016](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670), described the big fund-raising vehicle she had launched through the states the summer before, quoting a vow she had made to rebuild “the party from the ground up … when our state parties are strong, we win. That’s what will happen.”  >Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding, just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August. When the Politico story described this arrangement as “essentially … money laundering” for the Clinton campaign, Hillary’s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady.

">And that didn’t take money away from Sanders. Nor was it the money used in the primary against him.  >It also wasn’t the DNC funding him. The section you quoted clearly shows it was donations that Clinton was bringing in.  Nobody said she took money from Sanders, this is a straw man and an intentional misrepresentation of the issue.  People said she took money from the DNC separate and above what her campaign actually raised in order to pay for her campaign.  This she very much did do.  When one campaign is allowed to use party funds for their campaign but their competitors aren't, that is unethical and that lack of ethics came from DWS and the DNC leadership making an agreement with the Hillary campaign.  There were two sections quoted, one about how Hillary used her position as controller of the party finances to let her collect more donations than the rules allowed her to.  The second was about how she used her control over DNC finances to take money from funding donated to and set aside for down ballot races.  Both of these things can be, and are, true simultaneously.  Your deflection and misrepresentation is a failure.  >In other words, when she supports your position you believe her, and when she doesn’t, she’s obviously lying. Give me a break.

Yeah, she vaguely stated the race was 'fair' later when asked, show me where she ever repudiated her allegations about her using party machinery to let her donors bypass restrictions and take money they weren't entitled to, both from her donors and from down ballot races or admit she stands by the disclosures made.

Why are you okay with Hogg doing literally what you’re insinuating (and unable to prove) that the DNC did for Clinton?  Oh hey, another lie that people don't even have to click a link to verify.  First, Hogg is not doing what the DNC did for Clinton, this is a blatant lie on your part.  Second, even were it the same thing, which it isn't as you well know, the difference is transparency.
