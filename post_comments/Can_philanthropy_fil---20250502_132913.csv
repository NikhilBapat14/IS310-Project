"No.  That is why we have government and define in the preamble of the Constitution - ""promote the general welfare"".",TintedApostle,2025-05-02T13:32:14,20

The scarcity mindset would imply that only the very wealthy can help you if they take an interest and support your cause.  So no.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-02T13:45:48,5
"I was married to malignant narcissist and I recognize this move. This is called ""financial abuse."" All the money to make things work is now decided by the malignant narcissist. Now, the malignant narcissist does have an interest in things working, so they will give money. But, they also have a higher interest in using the money as a means to control. So, you *can* have your things back, *if* you're loyal, if you do xyz, if you tell us the location of hispanic/transgender/liberal people you know of, if you change your sanctuary city laws, if you elect their politicians, if you put a flag on your house etc. etc. etc.  Your arm will be twisted.",ariesgeminipisces,2025-05-02T19:57:25,2
"> In an interview with *Morning Edition*, NPR's Elissa Nadworny asked what happens when government funding dries up. Sabrina Howell of NYU's Stern School warned: ""No private company would take on [research] on their own because it's really expensiveâ€¦ only government can fund that kind of work."" In the same interview, Richard Vedder of the Independent Institute, a libertarian think tank, said: ""It may be a disruptive way to change things. But on the whole, the attempt to reevaluate research grant money is a valid one,"" Vedder said.  That's the point - public service is not *supposed* to be the same as private enterprise.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-02T13:30:21,3
"Fuck no.   Private entities have no obligations to the well-being of the public. I donate to charities and volunteer. These projects, while good, can not scale up to the services that the government can provide. With that said, some philanthropies are just pet projects that exist because the owner is aware of the problem.  Some even use philanthropies as a way for them to lower their tax burden. Right now, they (the ultra wealthy) are trying to offset their tax cuts by increasing it on the vast majority of americans and gutting government programs.",Boo_Radley80,2025-05-02T14:28:06,1
"Furthermore, the people have the recourse of elections to make changes to government if they disagree with government decisions. But what recourse do they have if Rich Sugar Daddy has all the decision-making powers over the Only School in Town?  Case in point: The ""free private school"" founded by Mark Zuckerberg [is closing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/tech/chan-zuckerberg-primary-school-closing). It's run by a board of directors - but it's accountable to the Chan/Zuckerberg foundation, not elected by the local residents.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-02T13:37:48,3
"One job of government is to do the tasks private business and personal philanthropy cannot accomplish at scale.   Healthcare should be on that list, BTW",473713,2025-05-02T14:46:40,2
