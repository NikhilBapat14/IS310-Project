"My closest friend is from Belarus. Moved here over a decade ago, now a US citizen. She laughed in my face when I mentioned I was worried we were headed toward something like that under Trump, that I believed Trump was in cahoots with her most hated person - Putin. She says her Belarusian husband loves Trump and that I was ridiculous to have this thought. That was five years ago. Now she refuses to speak about politics with me. It’s the fuckin elephant in the room now. I can’t help but wonder if their silence is how their own country was re-acquired by Russia. The culture of be quiet and don’t talk about it definitely pervades their thinking, for good reasons, I suppose. But it’s how this is now happening. Being quiet. Not talking about it. Not acknowledging it.",LiluLay,2025-04-26T09:34:01,65
">Coming from Egypt, I know a dictatorship when I see one. The same can’t be said for the white voters who brought Trump to power.  I think that a majority of White voters want America to be ruled by a White strongman. They see trump as that strongman and that's why they voted for him.  They think that trump will hurt Black/Brown people and elevate White people. This idea pleases them.  This racism has been part of America since forever. President LBJ made the observation back in the 1960s:  *""If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.""*",VanceKelley,2025-04-26T11:15:33,27

Mocking people does nothing but push them away and make your ideas sound terrible. All it is is just vindication for the person who “told you so.” That’s not how anyone gets swayed in views. Being understanding and able to have a real discussion that doesn’t belittle others while as well using reasonable language to persuade is much more important than being right.,notmonkeymaster09,2025-04-26T15:40:05,4

"We, as a society, need to remember that just because you were arrested or even charged with something does not make you guilty.   The man she ""hid"" by sending out a side door is no longer allowed in the country because he was arrested for something and charged, not because he was convicted.  Police will often frame people with made-up bullshit just because. Hell, in my home town, ""Police"" will routinely commit purjery by stating on the arrest warrant or to a prosecutor that the arrestee attacked them when they clearly didn't simply so they can get away with usages of excessive force.  Police have arrested me for ""hindering a police investigation"" because I deliberately and specifically informed the officer that I was invoking my 5th Amendment right to remain silent. How is exercising you Constitutional Right Obstruction of Justice, you may ask, it isn't.  Hell, ICE themselves have been routinely grabbing the wrong guy when they're seizing them, and often don't have a warrant.  Illegal searches also routinely lead to arrests, something the officer more than like knows they're not supposed to do.  There's a gentleman who was held by ICE in Tuscon even though he's an American citizen.  What this judge did might not be legal. However, what she did was her best at ensuring that immigrant would have Due Process with the charges that were levied against them. ICE have already pissed off a different judge for seizing them from the courtroom.  They are flagrantly violating the Constitution of the United States, knowingly against Court Orders, both in spirit, and by the letter.  I do not trust this administration to actually enforce the law, especially if they are refusing to assent to it themselves.  Remember, it's the act of getting arrested that this immigrant is being seized for, and I garuntee you that a member of the Juduciary is not signing their warrants. The immigration ""judges"" are not bound to the judiciary, but the executive, violating Article 3, Section 1. A Federal Judge is only beholden to the executive when having committed a crime or is suspected of it.  Again, an immigration ""judge"" is not an actual Judge beholden to the judicial branch of government but an executive officer and are not able to sign judicial warrants for seizure of people or evidence based on the tried probable cause stated under Oath.",BananasAndAHammer,2025-04-26T14:36:57,6

Petting them on the head and telling them it’s not their fault is going to do… what?   These are grown adults. Why do I have to treat them like children? They keep showing you who they are, and people like you keep letting them slap you in the face while you sit there and think there is some way to save them.

There are a pluritude of reasons people should have seen this coming, and it won't stop at illegal immigrants. Trump's regime and Trump himself have already ""floated"" the idea of sending American Citizens to CECOT for crimes like Terrorism(Treason).   What is Terrorism(Treason), you may ask? According to the regime, supporting the Constitutional Right to Due Process is considered Terrorism.   Trump wants to ship you overseas to be tortured over supporting the Constitution of the United States.
