"There is no cut-and-dry answer to this question because it is political in nature. NATO article 5 is non-binding, so each member state can make up their own mind about whether they would defend Poland if Polish territory gets attacked as a result of them joining the war in Ukraine.   Realistically, before Poland joined the war in Ukraine, they would discuss this with the other NATO member states and they would try to come up with a coherent strategy. No one can tell you what that strategy would like because it is entirely dependent on who is in power in the member states and what the current situation in Ukraine is.",Poebbel,2022-08-12T08:29:29,15
"Article 6 (yes, after 5) clarifies what constitutes an attack, to:  >	include an armed attack: > >on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America,   As well as some other regions that would not extend to Polish activity *in Ukraine*.  However, were Poland subsequently to suffer an attack on Polish territory, that would fall under Article 5.  Interestingly, that does not *necessarily* mean war, as a member nation can take action “as it seems necessary” - though practically speaking, if an attack occurred on Polish soil and NATO did not respond forcefully, it risks collapsing as an organization, as Poland and others might rightfully question the point of the treaty.

"At that point it would be up to the nation's leaders I think, MAYBE unless the severity of the nation was being threatened, but that's really shaky legally",Your_fav_commie,2022-08-12T16:17:20,1
"Article 5 has only been declared ONCE, and that was for 9/11. Article 5 is a defensive clause in nature, as in if you attack one you attack all. The caveat being that individual countries can still choose to sit out the conflict or choose their level of involvement. Some might commit troops, some might only collaborate in intel and not send troops, other might only send money or allow their logistical infrastructure to be used. While others can say no we will not participate and you can’t bring military vehicles through our territory (current example might be Hungary). In any case Article 5 is non-binding, but still carries weight.",bowery_boy,2022-08-12T11:19:41,6
