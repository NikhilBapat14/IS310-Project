"The amount of people jumping to conclusions and not reading the very short article is part of the reason why we're in this mess. JFC, put in a modicum of effort.  A plurality of people think he's terrible. The largest group of people that responded are people that are not pleased. This is objectively good.  However, the questions are easily misinterpreted and could cause a person to respond incorrectly, like the moron Republican they interviewed admits to misrepresenting his opinion. Only 30% say he's been great OR good which is about as many people that voted for him.  The fact that 20% think he's done an average job, is what confuses and leads me to believe that a fifth of our nation has a pretty poor opinion of presidents in general, have conflicting opinions about this president, have no idea what the president does or any frame of reference, is stupid, is incredibly optimistic (which might be redundant since I said stupid already), or is being dishonest.

Our stores have a few weeks of stock on hand as they usually do, and ships are still coming in with orders that were placed before the tarriffs. But in the last 2 weeks there has been something like a 40%+ drop in ships heading down the lanes to the US.  Store shelves are likely to be covid-bare by mid-April.   Even if Trump lifted all tarriffs on China today, it would take weeks to ramp production back up in factories, refile orders, load and then ship them halfway across the world.

"""Accelerationist"" is a term for people who are actively trying to break the US by pushing us toward a second civil war, often by triggering race hate or trying to destroy infrastructure. They don't want to see us come back to our Constitution and be the USA again. Many DO want to see fascism and see accelerating us to the point of violence and a means of accomplishing that. Timothy McVeigh was an accelerationist. The boogaloos boys are accelerationists. Accelerationism is very popular among white supremacist groups and other groups who think the breakdown of society will allow them to seize control and remake the US to whatever template they envision. Those Atomwaffen white Supremacists shooting at power stations -- accelerationists. The kid who killed his parents in preparation to kill Trump and trigger a civil war, accelerationist.   Accelerationism can come from the left, like some revolutionary communist strains of thought, although most of the organized groups today come from the right. Even if you envision a bright future after the violence and despair and destruction, the reality is the leaders would be the most violent group who is able to impose their control. Causing misery and war because you think that's justified by a belief that it will enable you to impose your world view on others isn't a philosophy of freedom.

If they have to admit we no longer have enough resources, they will use other countries as scapegoats instead of looking at their own decisions. They are already sowing the seeds for it. I think it's a risky gamble.   More optimistically, Trump hasn't 100% set himself up for success here because he is ""owning"" so many of the economic decisions that are having a direct and visible impact.

You're actually circling around the answers here.  That same support collapsed for Harris. Ask yourself why that is. You can't just nuke your own base and expect to win. Dem voters don't like Israel that much - it's just a fact. Many of the left-leaning people who voted for him in 2020 felt (and for good reason at times) that he didn't do enough and that he was looking a little too conservative by the end of his term on a variety of issues (immigration, Israel, especially). I don't agree that not voting or voting 3rd party were good tactics, but I can *get* where those people were coming from, despite their tactics being garbage.

Dems need to go from what the average uneducated American views as elitist technocrats to a working-class party again. There is actually no other way forward imho.   I genuinely think the Biden-era Dems did not actually understand the US electorate. People like Schumer are still out there going ""we sent a sternly worded letter to Trump.""

"> They stopped his gen z Twitter stuff, that‚Äôs it.  Way more than just that. Almost the entirety of his most effective rhetoric was thrown away. And notice how Harris's polling started dropping after (many factors, though).  The best way to beat a fascist is to humiliate them. They thrive on appearing as faux strong men. Tear them down and show people what they are. That's why everyone on the left of US politics gobbled that shit up, especially gen Z (and many of those males ended up voting for Trump in the end).   > Yeah, that‚Äôs where the blame goes  You are wrong. The elites are to blame. They've convinced you that your countrymen are your enemies. Sure, they're ignorant - but they're not your enemies nor are they *to blame* for the fact that their options are constantly trash now and money runs politics. We don't even have a real democracy given the fact that Citizens United happened.  > No they didn‚Äôt.  You realize wages can increase and the total cost of living can increase with it? That link only scratches the surface. Look: housing. It's a privileged take to imply Americans didn't get slaughtered by inflation / pandemic supply chain issues for a year or two in there. Especially lower class people who don't have cushy white collar jobs and were born into harsher conditions than probably either of us.  Many working types rightfully think many Dem politicians (and wealthier liberals) look down on them because they're uneducated, southern, etc. Yeah, don't do that and maybe they'll *actually* like the Dems more.  Whole party needs to stop coming across as elitist technocrats that don't give a fuck about uneducated people.  > Yes I am, the field right now is completely unprecedented in American history and is definitionally dictator shit  It absolutely is not. I've been studying political theory for 20 years at this point and it *factually* is not a dictatorship to use branches of the government to check economic power run amok. In fact, many dictatorships often *seek* power consolidation with economic elites. Even the Nazis were partially propped up by rich conservatives at the time. And it seems like you're actually implying we should just let the capitalists fuck us anyway, while money gets concentrated into the hands of the few (sounds like a dictatorship...).  > I‚Äôm not a fascist. I don‚Äôt want fascists in our government  Then you have to fight back with bold tactics. And your comments suggest you're not willing to imho while the Republic withers away from the inside.  > In an American government we spread executive power across departments and the President doesn‚Äôt tell them what to do directly.  Huh. That's not what I see from the current admin. Ideally it *should* work that way. But when you're up against people who are trying to control you, you have to punch them back with actual power.

They‚Äôre stupid, and they will pay in blood because they couldn‚Äôt be actual adults.  Don't blame them for their political parties constantly trotting out terrible options. Dems didn't have a primary and a dude with a sub-40% approval rating that was 81 tried to run again. On the other side, Trump made it his life goal to control the Republican Party and reinvent it in his image.  Can't blame your countrymen for the fact that elites run the world.  > Name one other president who directly commanded an agency head to do something, under threat of replacement, and didn‚Äôt get impeached over it. I‚Äôll wait.  Not even *Just* agency stuff. But look into how both Roosevelt's wielded their popular and executive power. They would get the people on their side and actively threaten other branches of government to whip them in line (FDR and SCOTUS, for example).  Here's a Teddy Rooselevelt example - someone who actually stifled a lot of capitalist power:  > Despite his caution, Roosevelt managed to do enough in his first three years in office to build a platform for election in his own right. In 1902 he resurrected the nearly defunct Sherman Antitrust Act by bringing a lawsuit that led to the breakup of a huge railroad conglomerate, the Northern Securities Company. Roosevelt pursued this policy of ‚Äútrust-busting‚Äù by initiating suits against 43 other major corporations during the next seven years. Early in his term, he also sought the creation of an agency that would have the power to investigate businesses engaged in interstate commerce (though without regulatory powers); the Bureau of Corporations was formally established in 1903.  [Source](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodore-Roosevelt/The-Square-Deal)  I can't even imagine Biden even attempting to do something like that. And I fundamentally disagree that checking actual robber barons is ""dictatorship"" when they *already run society anyway*. It's like you don't think economic power is power at all. Capitalism is hierarchical by definition. Unchecked economic power inhibits freedom, too. It *should* be checked - otherwise we basically get economic authoritarianism where rich elites run society (like the Gilded Age and the modern US).  > I don‚Äôt get why this is a difficult concept to you.  It's actually really not. And I think you're not reading my comments if you think I have trouble understanding how absurdly powerful the executive branch is right now (basically half my point).

"> No, American citizens should be less stupid.  Elitist take. Not everyone is born into privilege like us my friend. A lot of Americans live in broken education systems, to boot. The media environment (esp social media) is already almost impossible to navigate, especially with the proliferation of misinformation. Have some empathy. Those same people can be won with better options (generally economic populism wins the day) - history is proof. People got conned, but that doesn't make them inherently evil. Notice how Trump's approval is plummeting.  > There was exactly one terrible option in 2024.  Biden wasn't that great imho. Way better than Trump but he didn't give the people *enough* of what they wanted to buffer against the return of MAGA amid an economically turbulent time post-pandemic.  > Your Teddy example was not him forcing his agencies to do anything  I think you're missing the point. My point isn't that it has to be an agency - don't pigeonhole the argument. My point is that TR and FDR used their executive power wisely and turned levers hard when they had to.  > But as a matter of fact, the DOJ under Garland pressed charges against Trump twice and was thwarted by a corrupt judiciary and millions of morons in voting booths.  I mean he sat on his hands for years and then raided Mar a Lago. Could have done way more. Shame the GA shit got fucked and shame Cannon was where she was, but Garland could have done way more imho.  > what could they have done that wasn‚Äôt exactly the kind of dictatorship stuff we‚Äôre seeing Trump do  I mean Biden backed away from a legitimate abortion fight (again, the messaging matters here). Didn't even really *consider* court reform. Sucked at using the bully pulpit against the GOP. And I'll say it again, actually go after white collar crimes and elites with whatever legitimate mechanism possible - agency or not. Be way more adamant about marijuana reform to the point that Biden is actively saying ""ima try to legalize it.""  Marijuana is such low hanging fruit that it kills me that this shit hasn't been seized yet. like 70% of Americans want it federally legalized. And again, messaging matters here.  Those are just a few examples, and I didn't even touch Israel/Gaza. Another thing I think that's being lost here is that Americans always want a charismatic leader. And Biden just wasn't that (Clinton, Bush, and Obama were all fairly charismatic - hell, Trump is *very* telegenic - or at least used to be)  The *best* thing Biden could have done though would have been stepping down around the midterms and letting the party have an open primary - somebody who could actively beat Trump.",sharkflood,2025-04-27T23:17:56,1
