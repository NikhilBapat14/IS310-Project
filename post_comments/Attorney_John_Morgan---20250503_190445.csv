"Republicans say no.  They don’t want anything that’s worth a damn, America.   They’re just miserable curmudgeons that want to be scared of everything all the time and beat up on defenseless people.",LuvKrahft,2025-05-03T19:12:28,72
The state did vote for legalization in Majority   But republican legislature/Desantis decided to game the system by requiring 60% approval   They kinda fucked themselves on that one voting for the Republicans who pulled this shit though ,blues111,2025-05-03T19:32:00,36

Florida legislature made state constitutional amendments a super majority vote (60%).  Only four states have this high of threshold.  56% of voters in Florida voted for recreational marijuana in November 2024.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-03T19:51:41,6

"As someone who used to live in Florida, ***no.***  Floridians ***deserve jack shit***. SO MUCH of the current political climate and sentiment in the US can be traced back to Florida. It's quite literally the heart of American fascism, and they openly embrace that shit.  So...no. All they deserve is to wallow in misery while deluding themselves into thinking they're winning.",TheRustFactory,2025-05-03T19:42:12,17

Look up what the Florida legislature just passed regarding constitutional amendments. It’s gotten SO much worse.,LilWoadie,2025-05-03T19:49:58,13
"It been the law in Florida to require 60% super majority for amendments since 2006. Jeb Bush was president. Surprisingly, the amendment to require the 60% supermajority for amendments only received 57% of the vote.",Aquamaniac14,2025-05-03T20:47:44,14

Counterpoint.  You shouldn’t be able to amend a constitution with a simple majority. This allows zero protection for the minority.  And BTW I support legalization of marijuana.,Academic_Release5134,2025-05-04T13:12:44,0
