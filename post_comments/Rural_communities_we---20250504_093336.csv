Anyone who voted based on djt‚Äôs ‚Äúpromises‚Äù was already fucked from the get-go. ¬†Sorry but not sorry.,WetFinsFine,2025-05-04T09:34:57,48
"Excerpt:  The Trump administration canceled a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program that had promised billions of dollars in grants for disaster preparedness projects across the United States. Most of the grants had not yet been paid, leaving states without most of the promised funds.",D-R-AZ,2025-05-04T09:33:57,31
"Anyone shocked by this shouldn‚Äôt be. Trump has said time and again he wanted to get rid of FEMA, and yet those in rural areas still voted for him.   So why should I be upset for those who shot their own foot?",annaleigh13,2025-05-04T09:36:53,24
"I live in Mississippi and this state knew that Trump was going to save him from the ‚Äútrans-loving-satanic-army-of-liberals.‚Äù I wonder how they feel now with the evidence he cares more about his golf trips than he does helping them recover from a disaster. Honestly, I already know and the answer is super sad - they‚Äôre not even connecting the dots. They‚Äôre resigned to being thrown to the side and forgotten about. It‚Äôs sad",Dreaders85,2025-05-04T10:01:21,16

Tornado season is right now.  Wildfire season starts this month.  Hurricane season starts next month.     Lot of people are going to experience the cruelty of this administration when natural disasters start happening.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-04T10:57:24,9

"When will people learn: Democrats help the poor, Republicans help the rich. These rural areas that voted for trump, or any Republican for that matter, need to wake up.",MetalMamaRocks,2025-05-04T10:19:40,8

"He has a single-minded goal of getting his billionaire tax cut passed. It's actually the one ""accomplishment"" he can claim for both his terms and putting money back in his pocket is all that matters to him. ""Tax cuts"" and ""You're on your own"" is the fundamental ideology of Republicanism. Disasters don't put money back in his pocket. Until, of course, it's HIS property.",YallerDawg,2025-05-04T13:20:32,3

Goddamned Biden!ü§£üíôü©µ,Luked0g440,2025-05-05T19:13:39,1
"I live in rural Arizona and love rural life.  What's really absent here is solid news and analyses of economic impacts, educational impacts, medicinal impacts etc. on our communities.  Lots of folks get and listen to the only stuff available on local tv and raidio: Fox News and MAGA spins.  Instead of ""kicking a lame donkey', Democrats need to at least assure accurate news and reporting are available to rural communities.  I simply don't listen to any local raidio or watch any local TV, it's junk.  Thankfully I've got great internet....",D-R-AZ,2025-05-04T10:43:03,6
"They don't want us to just feel sorry for their self-inflicted foot wound. They also want us to bandage it, and then kiss the boo-boo for them, and make it all better, while still blaming us and Biden for their miserable lot in life, as well as their shitty voting choices.",Luked0g440,2025-05-05T19:21:55,1

"So now, Democrats are also at fault for the news content that conservatives consume? The blaming will never end.",Luked0g440,2025-05-05T19:17:51,1
"Well, no.  It's not the Dems fault.  But, it is a real phenomenon.  Most people want local news, regardless of where they live, and can include high school sports updates and scores, weather, goings-on, etc.  It turns out, the less and less local news there is, the more and more the people become low-information voters.  Or, non-voters.  This is one reason why the NPR thing is such a big deal, but it is not so much NPR, or even right-wing / left-wing politics.  When people don't get the localish paper, or localish news via radio, they tend to just not vote overall  Their alternative is the larger national news and opinion shows.  As it turns out, it is the local news that informs people when and where to vote --so it is not even about the content or if they pay attention.  Studies show that simply knowing when and where to vote, and nothing else, is what increases voter turnout.  This is one reason why Fox News is so damn popular in rural areas, and also why the GOP wages such a war against news media outlets.  it is also why there is such a disconnect between urban and rural areas.  Social media and the Internet might be enough for younger folks, but for older people --and not that much older, for the matter-- can't rely on social media for much more than gossip and who knows where particular Internet pages live, anyways?",crucial_geek,2025-05-06T10:41:51,1
