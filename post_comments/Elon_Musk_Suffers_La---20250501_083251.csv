"Let me see if I've got this right...(my numbers might be off, I didn't research this in detail. But the gist of it is)...  * Elon makes TSLA one of the ten largest companies in the world (by market cap). Remarkable. * Elon gets a pay package valued around 50 billion dollars over ten years, 5 billion per year.  * A quick search indicates that the next highest paid CEO is Hock Tan at Broadcom, for about $163 million annually. * Elon is getting paid 30 times as much as the next highest paid CEO in the world. And he is a part time employee, since he is also CEO of SpaceX and several other concerns. * Elon takes basically a five month paid sabbatical to work for the government. No formal return to office date specified. * Shareholders get upset because their world's highest paid CEO walks off the job while the company's market cap drops by roughly 50%. * Board tells shareholders to basically p**s off.

"He's been surrounded by people telling him he's great his whole life. You can hear that in how his father talks- like the infamous, he was friends with Black servants quote. In addition to the horribly racist context, those people weren't his friends- they were literally paid to be nice to him. Even if sone did like him, they weren't ever going to hang around him by choice otherwise. Musk is literally in a lawsuit because he threatened to deport a team pointing out safety issues in a car. He just gets rid of any opposition and only hears the positive stuff.  But getting into politics opened him up to public scrutiny, and he can't pretend everyone likes him. This is completely opposite to how he's lived, and he clearly cannot handle people who have no motivation to pretend to like him. This is why wealthy families tend to fall apart in 3 generations in modern history/capitalism. Musk is 3rd gen for his Canadian family. He has too many kids, and his wealth is showing signs of instability. He's following the pattern cause he was too coddled with too many resources, but cannot handle adversity.  This is why they're going authoritarian now. They cannot keep wealth without rigging the game. We're seeing a large scale meltdown to do so.",whichwitch9,2025-05-01T09:37:34,107

If the point was to really and truly look into downsizing, seeking more efficient ways of doing things, there are methods to do so.

It was just a hit hard and hit fast destructive manner with the intent being forewarned by the Heritage Foundation guy where the goal was to terrorize federal service people.

">Therefore they aren‚Äôt going to replace him unless the stock drops by 90% and there is suddenly nothing to lose.¬†  I'm not so sure. Generally, companies and their ""founder"" have this early period of huge, ambitious, growth focused on innovation and market disruption; but, at a certain point, they generally replace the founder (who becomes Chairman of the Board, or takes a board + c-suite position) and they replace the early team with a new series of C-suite hires that pivot from ambitious growth to an approach that focuses on more ""sustainable"" growth (focus on cost control measures, excellence in manufacturing and operational processes). Tesla's board may be going that route.   If Musk becomes a massive problem, they could remove him from the Board, which would be a nuclear option.

"I get what you're saying and I totally understand that the overvaluation throws complexity into this; however, what I would say is, the overvaluation isn't going to solve fundamental problems. As Musk becomes more of a distraction with DOGE - it's clear it won't generate the anticipated returns and the cuts have incurred costs that are 1.2-1.3x the ""savings"" it's clear that there's a downstream effect on Tesla.  I think if Musk retains his post, he needs to step away from DOGE, re-helm the ship and shore-up his equity position in Tesla; or, they try and pivot and work to increase sales, improve production and focus on efficiency. It's the only other path I see as viable.  Tesla is in a tough spot. Hyped product that often doesn't meet expectation and an overvalued stock that could plummet if enough people lose faith.

"I‚Äôm doing okay. All things considered there‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs annoying, but nothing I can‚Äôt manage.   Growing up my father was absent until he wasnt and then he was hellishly abusive. My mother was an alcoholic and ramped up her drinking throughout middle school until CPS caught wind and she was removed. I regularly skipped lunch and breakfast in highschool because there was no food in my house. My dad sometimes gave me $20 for lunch which I would stretch into $20 for lunch for the next two weeks. He couldn‚Äôt be bothered to pick me up so I regularly walked a few miles home with my backpack and clarinet or got rides from friends who knew what was going on.   All that to say just being homeless is manageable in comparison. Sometimes I‚Äôm hungry. Sometimes I skip meals. Sometimes I have to walk through the rain or shelter under a bridge for the storm to pass.   All of these things are doable. For now I‚Äôm on Medicaid to pay for my insulin. For now I‚Äôm on food stamps to get me through the worst or for food for low blood sugars. Not a day goes by that I‚Äôm not worried about those benefits though.   Growing up I always told myself, ‚Äúthings suck now, but the world is improving. Science is advancing. Medicines are being created. Food is being grown and hardships will be overcome.‚Äù   Clearly that was all a lie.   I‚Äôm somewhat educated. As in I did great in highschool and finished 100 units towards an engineering comp sci degree. I dropped out during trumps botched handling of COVID the first time when my dorms closed and classes went online only and my father moved back to Sweden and I found myself homeless. It‚Äôs basically just been a long descent since then.   So I‚Äôm not struggling with alcoholism or heroin use and though I do struggle hard with mental health (diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression, Acute Free-Floating Anxiety, and CPTSD), I pass as mostly normal at a glance, apart from maybe being soaked with rain and having a dilapidated backpack, and am generally able to advocate for myself.   So I‚Äôm better off than a lot in my situation. I just can‚Äôt find it in me to move on now. Everything around me that I see is disappointing. I don‚Äôt want to slave away for a company again just to find out they donate to the guy that wants insurance companies to be able to fuck me over for being born with the wrong genetics. I don‚Äôt want to make profit for the fuckheads who want me dead because I‚Äôm poor. I don‚Äôt want to support, in any way, the shitheels who punch down and defund education further.   I don‚Äôt see the US as good anymore and I‚Äôm wallowing in my filth while I figure out where I even go from here. El Salvador seems a poor option.
