"He should take his own advice, and in fact I'll bet most of these trans service members have more pride and balls than Hegseth or anyone in this administration   There should be no limits to a citizen of legal age wanting to.serve and make the ultimate sacrifice",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-09T12:01:13,12

"These people get some perverted kick out of being cruel to people they fear. And what the hell is this? ""or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria"" Are they going to start kicking people out for their voice being too high-pitched? This just convinces me more that Hegseth is actually a closeted homosexual who hates himself.",JoeWhy2,2025-05-09T12:06:56,10

The percentage of trans people in the general population is tiny. I imagine in the army it's miniscule. Seems like a lot of fuss about nothing really. If someone wants to put their life on the line as a job that should be the only qualification.,DMmeURpet,2025-05-09T12:36:20,2

SCOTUS already said it was ok to do. üòû,PluginAlong,2025-05-09T20:56:03,1
SCOTUS hasn't ruled yet on this. They chose to allow the litigation to work its way up to them instead of holding the injunction which is still not great but there could be hope (maybe).,Tangled349,2025-05-09T12:30:21,8
Why can't he just be a homophobe? It's entirely plausible to be a virulent homophobe while being a 0 on the Kinsey scale.,greenday61892,2025-05-09T13:28:03,5

"Still a protected class until that's overturned can absolute take them to court, scotus didn't give the green light they are allowing the litigation to work it's way up instead of holding the injunction.  It's definitely not good but it's also still very contestable in a legal sense.",redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-10T16:38:21,1
"It‚Äôs going to be costly, but it will give them a case to rule on that will allow them to potentially, functionally make being trans illegal, or at the bare minimum not a federally protected class, which would have MASSIVE impact by setting precedent.   It‚Äôs a very cynical strategic move.",Renegade_Ape,2025-05-09T12:39:49,6

"I honestly am not sure where they would fall on a SCOTUS act. I know the three liberal justices are a lock, Roberts is a wild card and then Amy Comey Barrett tends to be very particular and doesn't always fall in line.
