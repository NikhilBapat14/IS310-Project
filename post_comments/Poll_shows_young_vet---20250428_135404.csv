"I'm an old vet, retired Navy, and I'm disgusted with what has transpired in our country.  Racism, out and out government corruption, loss of global respect.  Our country has become a world-class joke.",Ineverseenthat,2025-04-28T14:10:50,56
"Trump: ""I have directed my attorney, Pam Bondi, to open criminal investigations of the pollsters who are reporting that there are people who do not like me and do not approve of my beautiful executive orders.""",Then_Journalist_317,2025-04-28T14:17:03,30

"When Clinton was But Her Emails-ing I saw lots of people who say a regular person would have gone to prison for what she did.  That was absolutely untrue, of course, but the Signal leak is ABSOLUTELY something a regular person would go to prison for.  There's no evidence that Clinton ever purposefully stored classified information on her server.  There is zero doubt that Hegseth intended to (and did) transmit highly classified information through insecure channels.",eskimospy212,2025-04-28T14:38:14,11
"I’ve been livid with Trump since his first term campaign. He’s been nothing but condescending and demeaning to the military, and his handling of SignalGate is nothing short of horrific.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-28T13:57:38,10
"Yeah, this is going to screw us in the end.  Not to mention that trump's trying to push our care away from the VA and into the for-profit system.",Crazy-Nights,2025-04-28T14:31:00,4
"I'm not a vet but I work for a defense contractor.  The training we had to take said that mishandling classified information is a serious crime and if we did that, we would get arrested immediately.  This is what normally happens to those who commit those crimes.  Hegseth should be arrested and prosecuted.",The-M0untain,2025-04-28T18:53:39,5

"Nope, they are fine with it and voted for it. We all knew Pete would get the gig",Alwaystired254,2025-04-28T16:45:56,2
Of course they are. Those of us who had to work with sensitive information knew exactly what would happen if we screwed up even if it was unintentional. If an enlisted person had done this the consequences would have been swift and severe. The double standard on display with this is disgusting.,CarolinaBat,2025-04-28T17:25:45,2

"\> IAVA officials said the survey should not be extrapolated to represent the views of all American veterans, since the younger generations of former military members share distinct characteristics from the previous ones.     Hm. So older vets don't mind if plans are compromised putting soldiers at risk? Or just the general principle of risking national interest (misguided or otherwise) just because the brass or above see themselves as above basic military standards? And certainly never mind benefits programs broadly - it was pretty much a part of the implied contract when one serves, no?",steve_ample,2025-04-28T14:31:48,1

I'm an old non-vet with significant DOD/IC experience.  The Commander in Chief needs a courts martial for running such a sloppy administration.,guttanzer,2025-04-28T18:33:29,1

"Because we know if it was any of us on signal discussing actual war plans and timings, we would be in Leavenworth until we died.    This “do as I tell you, not as I do” shit is not how it works.",DjImagin,2025-04-29T08:04:02,1
