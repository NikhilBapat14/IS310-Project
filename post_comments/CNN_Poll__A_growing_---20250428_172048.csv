"Bro I am beyond skeptical. So tired of the gentle language these writers use for this shit.  ‚ÄòCountry thinks Donald vonDipshit‚Äôs tariffs are absolutely trash, and are being used to usher in a technocratic theocracy with a dash of authoritarianism‚Äô is a more correct headline I‚Äôd think.",RynoBud,2025-04-28T20:36:13,1
