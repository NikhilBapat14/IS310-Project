"Notice that it says they arrested her while they ""investigate whether she"" did what they are claiming. Absent any danger of violence or a flight risk, an arrest prior to investigation is not the way things are supposed to operate.

">Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested April 25 by federal authorities who are investigating whether she tried to help an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week, officials confirmed.  Shit just got real, folks. Trump is going after the judges.",superanth,2025-04-25T09:38:35,790
"Several witnesses report that ICE did not present a warrant before entering the courtroom and it is not clear whether ICE ever possessed or presented a judicial warrant, generally required for agents to access non-public spaces like Judge Dugan’s chambers.  Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-19) issued the following statement:  “I commend Judge Hannah Dugan’s defense of due process by preventing ICE from shamefully using her courtroom as an ad hoc holding area for deportations. We cannot have a functional legal system if people are justifiably afraid to show up for legal proceedings, especially when ICE agents have already repeatedly grabbed people off the street in retaliation for speech and free association, without even obtaining the proper warrants. While the facts in this case are still unfolding, it’s clear that action like Judge Dugan’s are what is required for democracy to survive the Trump Regime. She used her position of power and privilege to protect someone from an agency that has repeatedly, flagrantly abused its own power. If enough of us act similarly, and strategically, we can stand with our neighbors and build a better world together.”",ShakeyLegsMcGee,2025-04-25T09:53:39,813

That's literally all I could find anywhere and I can't even find that, anymore. However, based solely off of that story, it does sound like something anybody would get in trouble for.
