"That's how bad this morning's report was. There isn't any angle of redemption that he could leverage to get his base to focus on. So he blamed it all on Biden.    And because his Liberation Day stunt was just at the beginning of April, the GDP numbers reflect the *promise* of his tariffs impact on the market, not the actual effects itself. ",elCharderino,2025-04-30T15:35:47,4

"I think we all know that the real person responsible for all of this is Jimmy Carter with possibly a bitof help from Franklyn Roosevelt, as well.  Whereas the growth that occurred during Biden's reign was as a direct result of Trump's actions from 2016 to 2020.",crazybones,2025-04-30T15:49:18,1
