"The US Govt is a joke. A running gag. My laws for thee, but none for me. Why arenâ€™t real law enforcement people serving these lunatics with indictments?

She didnâ€™t have any insider knowledge. What really happened is Biden included her in a signal chat wanting to tell his son to make those trades. Those crazy libs did it again,trastamara22,2025-04-12T00:40:07,6

"Funny that her hat is in the past tense.  I mean, it also does imply that he is not right about everything.

He probably didnâ€™t appreciate being called out  by Trump for making $2.5 billion in one day. He probably wanted to keep it quiet but he also wants to continue getting the insider trading info.,Loggerdon,2025-04-12T01:10:43,2
