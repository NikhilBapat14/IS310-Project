"They can be removed through the impeachment process, but it's virtually impossible in this political climate because it would require 67 Senators to vote for the Justice to be removed.",mrebrightside,2022-09-02T08:10:47,24
"Effectively, yes.  Technically Supreme Court Justices can be impeached by Congress following the same process for impeaching a President. However, that requires 2/3 of the Senate to convict and remove from office. Neither party has had a 2/3 majority since 1967, and it's unimaginable that a significant number of Senators from either party would vote to convict and remove a justice of their own party.",[deleted],2022-09-02T08:42:15,18
"The Constitution says SCOTUS justices can be impeached.  - The one and only time the [House impeached a Supreme Court justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States#List_of_formal_impeachments) was Samuel Chase in 1804.  He was acquitted by the Senate in 1805. - The House [investigated William O. Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States#Other_impeachment_investigations) twice, in 1953 and 1970, but both times the investigation ended in committee.  While the Constitution says in theory judicial impeachment of a SCOTUS justice is allowed, in practice it's going to be widely seen as reducing judicial independence and breaking down the separation of powers across branches of government.  In recent years there's been a series of [escalating Supreme Court shenanigans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDYFiq1l5Dg), so it's certainly not outside the realm of possibility we'll see an attempt at a SCOTUS impeachment if the trend continues.",white_nerdy,2022-09-02T11:31:51,7
"I am actually wondering... does any lawyer here know if the FBI or justice department can charge a justice with something? Can they be arrested before impeachment?  What if ACB decides to open fire on a crowd with a handgun, or Kagan decides to whip out a Katana and starts swinging?! lol  Okay maybe less crazy... What if a justice is found taking bribes for rulings and is caught dead to rights? Can the justice department arrest them for corruption charges?",thedabking123,2022-09-02T10:30:49,4
"Yes and no. You can always impeach, but that itself can be a very political process and incredibly difficult. While impeachment in general was designed to be a difficult, last ditch effort to preserve a trusted position, the highly partisan nature of todays politics makes it even more difficult.",Zeddo52SD,2022-09-02T10:33:39,4
"A lot of people are referring to impeachment in the US as a political process and not a legal process, which is true; any officer can be sacked at any time for any reason via the impeachment process. In reality, however, impeachment of judges is only exercised when it is clearly *apolitical*, and conducted as a quasi-legal procedure in accordance with the law and precedent.   There have been 11 judges in US history that have been impeached and either resigned or were convicted and removed from office, the most recently being [the impeachment of Thomas Porteous in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Porteous#Impeachment_proceedings). If a member of the Supreme Court acted in a similar manner (tax evasion, public drunkeness, accepting bribes, and so on), I think there is a little doubt the Congress would take up impeachment.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-09-02T11:59:55,3

"The fiction that the ""conservatives"" and ""liberals"" on the Court rather than Republicans and Democrats is wrong and implies the Court is somehow above or separate from partisan politics. It's not and it never has been. It's always been a political institution since our founding. Bush v Gore should have made that plainly obvious to everyone.",[deleted],2022-09-02T17:41:40,9
"So by your logic if someone like Clarence, is found to be peddling influence in some way, he can be arrested and essentially removed from the court by being unable to attend cases after being imprisoned?  Or maybe you're saying that charges can be made, but impeachment is the only way to try them?",thedabking123,2022-09-02T11:45:47,1
"Absolutely not. I hate to be a party pooper but most citizens don't care that much about January 6th.  Most Americans are opposed to charging trump and the people who think trump is responsible is about a third of the population. Nine out of 10 people did not have their minds changed with the hearings, and the ones who did change their mind changed it favorably for Trump.  So I'm not sure how expanding the investigation would lead to SCOTUS justices being impeached.",solid_reign,2022-09-02T18:56:57,-6

"I don't recall anything in the constitution that says SCOTUS justices are in any way removed from the rule of law. There are two separate things here: criminal charges and trial, and impeachment charges and trial. The latter doesn't require the former and the former doesn't require the latter.   Practically speaking, for a prosecutor to decide to go forward with indictment, it's safe to say the bar would be a lot higher than it would be with an ordinary citizen-they'd want to be certain of success, I would imagine.   That said, were a scotus justice charged with a crime which could result in imprisonment, I can't imagine how truly awful the political situation would have to be in order for summary impeachment to not occur more or less instantaneously lol.  But I suppose it wouldn't be required... There's no constitutional *requirement* to impeach under any circumstances.",Ereignis23,2022-09-02T12:10:32,7
Supreme Court Justices don’t have immunity from prosecution. If they are arrested and miss some court dates then there would be less people physically at the court while that is being sorted out. But they would free to be back on the SC once the Justice is no longer in custody. Impeachment would be the only way to permanently remove them.,David_bowman_starman,2022-09-02T17:07:59,2

"Really? Name some cases that prove your point. The independent nature of the Court begun with Marshall continued until the 1930's and by 1940 had swung back to decisions that reflected the intent of the founders informed by history v political dogma. Examples: McCullock v Maryland 1819 gave Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, Gibbons v Ogden 1824 the power to regulate navigation and a pot load where SCOTUS ruled that the Bill of Rights extended to the States. Oh, Adams was BEFORE Marshall created the idea SCOTUS could overrule Congress, so their ""politization"" would've been pretty meaningless.",Olderscout77,2022-09-03T13:58:08,0
"I wonder if there are mechanisms internal to the Court- rules, procedures, etc- which would come into play here. It's an interesting question.  Like, even on a simple concrete level, are Justices allowed to vote on cases they don't hear oral arguments on? Present with the capacity to question the lawyers in real time? And if not, then a simple rule baring zooming or conference calling in for arguments would effectively make it impossible for an incarcerated justice to participate.  Seems like a fun plot arc to explore. I'm kinda surprised we've never had a Prestige Television series based on SCOTUS. I may need to pitch this to HBO!",Ereignis23,2022-09-02T19:30:13,3
"Thanks for the source. Before diving in, I would add that this is just one poll so always be careful forming opinions around them. I’ve worked with a lot of polling data in the last year and there is a lot more variation than you might think even when perfectly controlling for question wording. So generally one poll alone isn’t great for concluding an awful lot, but it isn’t useless either.  > Most Americans are opposed to charging Trump  According to the poll you linked, this is not true. 41% support charging him, 34% are opposed, and 25% are unsure. In other words, this evidence suggests more people support charging Trump for Jan. 6th than oppose charging him.  Knowing that, along with how partisan the split is, it seems more understandable that not many minds were changed. Few Republicans watched at all and the Democrats and Independents who did likely held their existing opinions.",Philosophfries,2022-09-04T18:09:21,1

"> a similar 42% said Trump is directly responsible. ... When asked how to describe the incident at the Capitol building, 64% say “riot” is appropriate and 52% say “insurrection” is appropriate  It's pretty clear, from your own poll, that it's not just a third of the country who think he's responsible, and the fact that half the country thinks it was a legitimate insurrection shows that people actually are concerned about it.
