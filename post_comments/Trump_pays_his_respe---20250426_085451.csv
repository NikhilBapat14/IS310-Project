"Snippet from this news article:”ROME (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday paid his respects to Pope Francis, occupying a front-row seat in sunlit St. Peter’s Square as more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attended the funeral of the Catholic Church leader who pointedly disagreed with the American on a variety of issues.  Trump and first lady Melania Trump were seated next to Estonian President Alar Karis and not far from French President Emmanuel Macron for the outdoor service on a cloudless morning.  Diplomacy also was on Trump’s agenda during his eight-hour visit to Italy: Trump had a brief private meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy inside St. Peter’s Basilica before the service. Photos showed them seated on chairs facing one another in a marbled room and hunched over.  President Donald Trump, third from right, flanked by first lady Melania Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, front row left, and Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, second left, attend the funeral of Pope Francis in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Saturday, April 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) Read More After Trump was shown to his seat for the funeral, he was immediately followed out of the basilica by Zelenskyy, who was met with a burst of applause from the audience. It was their first face-to-face encounter since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting in late February. Trump has been trying to broker an end to the war in Ukraine that began in February 2022 when Russia invaded. Trump stood out at the funeral service in a dark blue suit and a lighter blue tie in a sea of mournful black attire. The first lady, who is Catholic, wore a black dress and veil. Trump considers himself a “nondenominational Christian.” The couple paid respects to the late pope in front of his wooden coffin.",AndroidOne1,2025-04-26T08:55:15,1

"He wore the only pale blue suit.  Dark blue would have been fine.  His was the lightest color suit by far.

I'm looking at that photo seeing several people wearing suits or dresses that are just as bright. And Zelinsky isn't wearing a suit at all.   BTW the right wing didn't make the tan suit a thing. Like a couple people commented on it at the time and that was it. The only times I personally have ever heard about Obama's tan suit are lefties complaining that the right made a big deal about it.,GoldenEagle828677,2025-04-28T07:23:17,1

"No, the story of the day is the Pope's funeral.  The American politics story about the Pope's funeral is Trump pays his respects to a pope who publicly and pointedly disagreed with him over the years.  That's an unbiased headline.

">I'm looking at that photo seeing several people wearing suits or dresses that are just as bright.   I am not seeing what you are seeing. Not in the major rows for sure.  >BTW the right wing didn't make the tan suit a thing  Immediate response:  U.S. representative Peter King, a member of the Republican Party, deemed the suit's color combined with the subject matter of terrorism to be ""unpresidential"".

">I am not. Not in the major rows for sure.  The light is coming directly at Trump and he's in a front row so it looks more prominent but there are several people. And the Arabs are wearing mostly white. The requirement was to wear a dark suit. Trump did that. You don't need to keep spinning your wheels on this one.   >U.S. representative Peter King, a member of the Republican Party, deemed the suit's color combined with the subject matter of terrorism to be ""unpresidential  Like I said, a couple people commented on it. That's it. It wasn't a big deal. At that time I was listening to Fox News on satellite radio regularly and never heard it mentioned even once. ""Tan suit"" only appears 3 times ever in any submission to the conservative subreddit, and none of them are actually criticizing Obama about it.

"> The light is coming directly at Trump and he's in a front row   Hmm - first no.  And even so that is what light colored suits do when the light is on them.  That is how color absorption works.
