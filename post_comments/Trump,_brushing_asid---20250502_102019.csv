"But he said 'Religious Liberty'!  All jokes and sarcasm aside, it's obvious what this is.  My poorly defined point is that we need to use their riles against them. Even if it's only symbolic. This is clearly chiristofascism.  But what do left of center people do when Trump and his band of idiots do something unconstitutional and authoritarian? We typically get mad and stomp our feet. That hasn't been working. Instead, I think we need to use their tools and their against them. Again, even if it's a mere symbolic gesture. Maybe then there can be court cases, like from putting up pentagrams in front of public buildings.  Similarly to how Democratic politicians address the president like: ""With all due respect, Mr. President, that's something an authoritarian would do!"" Totally ineffective and limp passive aggression. Because Trump doesn't give a fuck if you call him a dictator or a nazi.  What does bother him is childish insults. That's because that is how his brain works. He can't process anything complex or anything with any degree of nuance. The things that bug him the most are other people getting praised and stupid, infantile criticism. And why more people aren't doing that is beyond me.  And sorry for posting this disjointed wall of text. You didn't ask for it or deserve it. I just don't know why we don't do what we've seen work in the past. Nothing bothers a child more than being treated like a baby.",FartyJizzums,2025-05-02T11:06:38,6
"I'm an atheist-leaning agnostic, and I just went to their website. And I'll be damned (pun intended) if I am not considering joining.  So that's at least 1.  And before I get pooped on, I know that satanic temples are typically non-theistic.

I agree üíØthe best way is to be on the offense and by offense we get OFFENSIVE with him. His supporters are mindless zombies programmed by Faux News and ultra right wing sh!t birds who are just vultures and bottom feeders at best. We the people need to remind Trump he works for us. All of us and we are not happy with his performance. It‚Äôs time he learned what being unpopular really feels like. He avoided jail but not the court of public opinion. I say we get protests that attack his policies and esp attack his ego. It‚Äôs his weakest area.,nickscorpio74,2025-05-02T20:53:33,3
