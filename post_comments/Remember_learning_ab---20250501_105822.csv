"The most bizarre part of that is Stephen Miller's Jewish heritage; there's a reason his family has basically disowned him. His obsession with, and fear of, immigrants is astounding.",Obvious-Gate9046,2025-05-01T12:35:27,9
"My grandfather was the youngest in a very large family. All of the males served in the military. He served in Vietnam but his three eldest brothers served in WW2.   I remember hearing stories of how scary the ‚ÄúReich‚Äù was. The death camps, being outgunned by their weaponry, the determination of their soldiers, etc‚Ä¶   I couldn‚Äôt imagine how terrifying it must‚Äôve been under Nazi rule. I have so much admiration for the ‚ÄúGreatest Generation‚Äù because of what they were able to overcome.  Contrast the Third Reich of then with the Turd Reich of today and, these asshats don‚Äôt invoke an ounce of that fear. Yet, somehow, they‚Äôre victorious at every turn and bringing us closer and closer to fascism every single day. It‚Äôs mind boggling!  I‚Äôm hopeful that we can turn the tide sometime in the, hopefully near, future. If not, I think history will remember us as the ‚ÄúWorst Generation‚Äù or, perhaps even the ‚ÄúWeirdest Generation‚Äù.",JookieThePartyInACan,2025-05-01T12:43:10,10
