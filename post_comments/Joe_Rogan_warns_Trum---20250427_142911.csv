"Also Joe Rogan on the eve of the election: “The great and powerful Elon Musk. If it wasn’t for him we’d be f**ked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way. For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.”  He knew what Trump was when he endorsed him, and now he’s got buyer’s remorse? He owns a part of this.",Piccolo60000,2025-04-27T14:56:00,1549

He is just so so stupid. My god. I just don’t get to how we got to a place where supposedly intelligent human beings ignore what they know to be true to adopt a pure fantasy. Rogan has lived in a fantasy world - and pulled his listeners in - and now that he’s seeing some of the real consequences is he saying oh hey this may be bad. I’d like to issue him a special fuck you. He is complicit to where we are at - and all the risks the world is facing.,thoughtxchange,2025-04-27T14:57:57,21

Now he’s realized his error, it does no good for us to chase him back over the fence. Let’s let him tell other people about his mistake. Like it or not, he has significant influence over a huge audience. I think a lot of people stick with Trump just because they made a bad choice in 2016, and are too stubborn to admit they were wrong.

"Look, I'm about as liberal as you can be, and I don't have any particular preference for or against Rogan but the notion that  he's somehow complicit because he had people that wer antivacers or what have you is fucking stupid.   Give credit where credit is due, not once has he said he's an expert on anything. He's had Bernie Sander and Ben Shapiro on ffs two people on completely different sides of the spectrum politically.   Asking questions and listening to someone whose views aren't factual doesn't inherently mean that you're advocating for those positions.   To quote Mr. Spock: ""I do not agree, I understand.""  There's this thing called the paradox of tolerance in political science. In order to create a more tolerant society, we must be intolerant of intolerance. Good idea.   The problem with a lot of liberals is they forget that you have to explain why something is a bad idea. You need to understand that you have your beliefs and values and that you've come to those conclusions on your own or you were indoctrinated. Calling someone a rascost homophobic piece of worthless garbage who should be ashamed for existing isn't the way to win people over.  Who are you going to be more receptive to the person who listens to what you have to say but doesn't agree with or the person that says you should be put down like a dog for your beliefs?   ""Judge, not least you be judged yourself.""   If you don't believe people have the capacity to change. That they're the same person today that they were five years ago. Let's take that  to  the ideological extreme and just kill everyone. If people aren't capable of learning and are never going to change, let's just go full scorched earth/s   Yes, progressive ideas are good. Don't be a rascist or a bigot, have diversity in your organizations, but you have to let people come to those conclusions themselves and not isolate them if they feel otherwise. If you're so weak and dim that someone says something, your fee is distasteful, and that threatens you. You're really not all that powerful, and you're definitely not the people to convince the fence sitters to your side. I'm not saying you should be forced to associate with people whose beliefs you find repulsive, but if you're trying to have a dialogue with someone being dismissive of them or any change they have made in their lives isn't the way you go about that and progressives because many have been marginalized need to look in the mirror and realize being defensive helps nobody.",Chronophobia6,2025-04-27T17:25:01,2

"Joe Rogan is a fucking hypocrite. He platformed Trump. He advocated for Trump. He voted for Trump. He has known from the start exactly who Trump is and what he stands for, and he has been all in for all of Trump's policies wholeheartedly, except that it's starting to affect his ratings and listenership numbers.    Joe Rogan is NOT a good guy. He is not an honest guy. He is an opportunistic, bigoted, Trump cheerleading, MAGA flag waving POS, and he deserves to go down on the Trump ship to the bottom of the sea. Ignore his supremely deceptive fork-tongued hand wringing. TUAH!",manofsteelbuns,2025-04-28T04:24:32,2

"Joe Rogan is like a puppy dog. If you go on his show you can usually convince him of something.   He’s been duped by Trump and Musk, Bernie went on his show and he said he would vote for Bernie. Kamala refused to go on his show and so he never heard her side of it. She would have actually probably convinced him of a few things. I honestly believe that.   He wants to be like this kind of self sustaining macho man that lives off the land. He’s dumb enough to think both sides deserve a fair chance when you really don’t if you are against the rights of LGBTQ or any other minorities, aligning yourself with racists and being racist yourself.

He would get people to shill alphabrain and other products on his old Rogan board forums and these fanboys ate it up.

"\> We should definitely give a warm reaction to people doing the right thing, admitting they were wrong, evolving, and give them a good place to come to. There are a lot of people that were duped and yes they can redeem themselves.      Why do you think Rogan is one of those people? He's repeatedly been ""duped"" for years and years in increasingly hypocritical and clearly self-interested ways. I'm excited for when he supports another asinine candidate or policy again and you extend him this massive benefit of the doubt yet again... and even now, had you read the article, you'd understand he's still not saying he made a mistake. He just doesn't want ""we"" (trump and his supporters/administration) to ""become monsters.""  His singular job is informing himself about what he's talking about, and when he has an unparralleled platform, that comes with responsibility. If he doesn't know what he's talking about, **he should shut up.**",Purusha120,2025-04-27T15:23:02,24

"Nobody was ""duped."" Agenda 47 and Project 2025 were publicly known. Trump was explicit about what he would do and why.

Some of them will only be satisfied if Israelis lay down and die when attacked.  2000 lb bombs are necessary given the deep tunnel structures Hamas built into the infrastructure. There is no other safe option to take them out. You can't flood them because the environmental impact would be devastating to Gaza, especially the water table, not to mention any hostages that may still be living. It would be suicide to attempt to attack by going into the tunnels with soldiers.  So IDF evacuates the civilians, at great risk to their own soldiers, and uses these bombs to destroy the tunnel entrances and exits. There is no other option. I'd love to hear your solution.
