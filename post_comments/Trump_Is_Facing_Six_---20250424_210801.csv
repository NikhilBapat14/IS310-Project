"Here are the 6 wars:  1)Ukraine\Russia  2)Middle East and the Houthis in Yemen.  3) Isreal\Palestine  4) Iran and it's attempt at getting a nuclear weapon.  5) A Chinese Cold War.  6)The Trade War in General.   Yeah, the first 4 are military conflicts that meet the definitions of War.  IMO, the Chinese Cold War and the trade war are the same thing, but there are at least 4 different potentially armed conflicts in the current world that Trump is just failing at.",kia75,2025-04-24T21:35:39,30

Losing six battles after his six bankruptcies is par for the course but this time he appears to be driving the US into both financial and moral bankruptcy. If the USD and Treasury bonds slide much further then the US could lose its status as a safe store of capital. Too far and it risks default.  In the past America has often been the first to enter recession and the first to recover. The USD status as the global reserve currency of choice had a lot to do with this ability to bounce back into recovery.  Without it the USA will have greater difficulty in pulling itself out of recession. Vulture capitalists like Trump and his cronies have depended on an economic recovery which has in the past averaged 3.5 years.   This time it could well be a recession which is deeper and of longer duration with a risk of it developing into a depression.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-24T21:42:54,6

"Problem when he loses at anything (which is often), he shifts the blame. If no one close to him can take that blame, he'll shift that blame to a convenient target/group...which will just start another war.  Because he pretty much handpicked everyone who works for him at this point, if he shifts the blame to any of them, it'll make it seem like he screwed up and made the mistake of hiring them. And he neeeeeever screws up and makes mistakes, so he'll blame convenient groups and populations. Like with Hegseth, it's not HIS fault, blame the media for publishing all that shit! They're to blame!  The more he fucks up, the more he'll blame others, and the more he'll fuck-up from that. It'll snowball. And everyone BUT him will pay the price.  Enjoy your vote, America.

"Many of the conflicts now would still be happening right now under Harris. I know I'd agree more with the direction of our power being applied, because the current leadership ranges from suspect to actually criminal. He may have limited immunity he can operate in, but may god help all the enablers who defy their oaths and mandates and let him own the law. I hope they don't all realize that if they lose control of the ability to keep the law at bay, it will someday crash down and bury them all.  That might incentivize them to just keep this baby rolling. Trump 2028!!! Let's roll out P2025 phase 2 already?!",anemone_within,2025-04-24T22:22:46,-34

"Of course. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the only one who can make Russia leave Ukraine is Russia. We can coax, try and negotiate or we can give the Ukrainians enough aid to try and wait it out in hopes Putin is no longer in power. We’ve been doing all of those things, but the only way to maintain the overall post WWI consensus that nation states cannot use unprovoked war as a means to gain territory is to aid Ukraine to wait it out. This is based on the fact that is becoming clear that the Russian demands will be based around getting territory if there is a treaty.",P1xelHunter78,2025-04-25T06:05:13,5
