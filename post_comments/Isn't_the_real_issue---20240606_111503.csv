"Yes, which is why hiring more agents, asylum officers, and judges was a major part of what the bipartisan immigration bill from earlier this year was supposed to do before a certain campaign tanked it.   If you want an effective asylum system, you don't want it to be *too* fast because it's really f'ing hard to gather evidence to support a claim. But current processing times take years. Our obligations (and every other signatory country's obligations) under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees is not to deport or reject someone who makes an asylum application until they've been adjudicated to not qualify. If you actually think people are abusing the tool, you can either withdraw from the treaty (and lose it's protections), or speed up your processing time.",Arthur_Edens,2024-06-06T13:05:56,22
Yes. That is the issue that the Democrats Biden administration were addressing with their recent immigration bill that the Republicans refused to allow a vote on.,Gurney_Hackman,2024-06-06T13:42:05,7
"The extreme bottleneck of our legal system for immigration - whether simply as immigration or as asylum-seeking - is a huge contributor to people seeking ways in around the system. It's not a matter of false claimants gumming it up - we had a *ten year backlog* in the start of 2020. We allocate too few resources to processing and entirely too many to reaction-based agencies like ICE. As they say, an ounce of prevention is a pound of cure.  A ten percent reallocation of ICE's budget would be a thousand-percent increase in funding for our immigration courts. That's a pretty nominal cut for exponentially widening the bottleneck.  Even for people who don't see it as the human right and international law issue that it is, it's fiscally sensible to get more people through processing so they can work, pay taxes, and *not* be subject to the whims of *actual* hardened criminals - the smugglers profiting off the situation and bringing people over unlawfully. You want to strangle the coyotes, improve the system for ordinary people to be able to enter the country - even provisionally - instead of choosing the option that gives them a *chance* instead of watching their kids starve while they wait to get across.",urbanviking318,2024-06-06T16:06:29,2

The REAL issue is that Reagan decided to stop arresting the managers and CEOs of the companies that hired illegal workers. Start putting those guys in jail again and watch the immigration issues largely dry up.,Phog_of_War,2024-06-06T18:16:54,1

"The major problem is that the process and infrastructure set up to process these refugees is being overwhelmed. The refugees are walking thousands of miles due to the circumstances in their country. They believe their families aren’t safe there. The proper and moral solution would be to either grant them all sanctuary or to change the process and supplement the infrastructure to process them much faster. No, not everyone will walk the thousands of miles to get here.",stewartm0205,2024-06-06T12:55:31,1
"Nobody wants to “fast-track review.”  Ds (except Biden) - Want claims to take longer so people in the country can put down roots, have children who are U.S. citizens in the years it takes to process a claim, and make it harder to remove people who entered illegally. They will claim it is splitting up families, taking parents from their US citizen children or forcing US citizens out of the country, and that the people have been tax-paying, law abiding citizens and should stay.  Rs- Want to campaign on “border crisis” and millions of dangerous illegals in the country taking jobs.   Biden - Wants to have his cake and eat it too. He needs to look tough, while doing nothing (which is a politician’s bread and butter). He signed the EO knowing it wouldn’t stand up in court so he can look tough on the border to independents who may stay home in November. But “fast-track review” could split up families right before the election, which would hurt him with young voters, latino voters, and aapi voters (especially young latino and AAPI voters). Biden is [already struggling with those voters](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/05/nx-s1-4987296/young-voters-biden-gaza-inflation-abortion-trump-genforward-poll) and can’t lose their support.

"Its a little simplistic to not admit that the immigration bill - which clocks in at 370 pages - is filled with a *bunch of other stuff*.  Even [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/05/biden-bipartisan-immigration-deal-00139558) broke it into ""12 major points in the border deal"" and just going through that, I can see a few items that would cause issues (work permits immediately?).  I guess what surprised me by the Executive Action is that it was far harsher than what the immigration bill supported - it had 5k per day but [Biden's EO is 2.5k](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-executive-order-shutting-southern-border-rcna155426).  And I guess that works to limit the addition to the backlog, but why is there no support for a single item bill to try and address these issues one by one?  I mean, I'm pretty sure its the political game so each side can run to the media and claim that ""[other side] hates [good thing]"" while ignoring its packed with [questionable things]/",LordFoxbriar,2024-06-06T13:50:56,-4
Sounds like supply and demand. The US takes in 5x the next closest country in Legal immigrants. Wanting something really badly doesn't give you the right go hop the fence or skip the line.  The majority of asylum claims are rejected because people simply don't qualify. The shift from illegal migrants trying to claim asylum is a loophole that is being exploited.,cuteman,2024-06-06T20:44:33,1

Not like Trump or Biden arrested these guys either. Agreed it's problematic that no one is willing to prosecute the people knowingly hiring illegal immigrants but this bill would have let all asylum claimants work immediately regardless of validity of asylum claim so it's a bit of a moot point.,TaruuTaru,2024-08-08T00:08:21,1

"> why is there no support for a single item bill to try and address these issues one by one?  Large bills are typically designed to give enough people something to get to a majority. Piecemeal, there's not enough support for A and B unless you promise That A and B will be accompanied by C and D. That's especially true when you have divided government. That's the nature of compromise.",Arthur_Edens,2024-06-06T15:46:07,10
"I don't follow your logic. You're saying ""This bill was long and dealt with a lot of the issues surrounding immigration, therefore it was a political game and not a real bill."" That's nonsense.  If the Republicans disliked some of the components of the bill, they could have passed a pared down version and sent it back to the Senate. Or they could have at least publicly stated which aspects of the bill they disagreed with. You're just both-sidesing for its own sake.",Gurney_Hackman,2024-06-06T17:42:35,5

"And?    The House passed their bill to ""secure the border"" and the Senate didn't pass it.  The Senate then passed their bill to ""secure the border"" and the House didn't pass it.  Should the House have tried again?  Maybe.  We could debate that but its ultimately meaningless waste of time.  If the Senate didn't pass it before, is there any sign they would have passed it now?  Both were done during the period after Biden rescinded Trump's EO's and before Biden issued his latest.  Whether it was last year or two years ago really doesn't matter - the political and legal landscape on which they were presented and passed (in their respective Houses of Congress) were virtually identical.  And if you really wanted to get picky, you could argue that the Senate (or Democrats) only presented their bill when the House (or Republicans) showed them the problem.  Or, to be less kind about it, Democrats didn't care about the border until Republicans presented them a bill.",LordFoxbriar,2024-06-06T22:13:11,1
"> Should the House have tried again?  Yes, because if they passed the Senate bill, it's a law unless the President vetos it, which he wouldn't have because it was his bill.  > If the Senate didn't pass it before, is there any sign they would have passed it now?  Yes, the fact that they just did.  > the political and legal landscape on which they were presented and passed (in their respective Houses of Congress) were virtually identical.  So why not pass it? The Senate rejected the House bill last year because they want it to tie it to aid to Ukraine and Israel.

">Yes, because if they passed the Senate bill, it's a law unless the President vetos it, which he wouldn't have because it was his bill.  Or the Senate could pass the House bill.  Both are just as valid.  Just because Biden is President doesn't mean he gets to ignore the House of Representatives.  >Yes, the fact that they just did.  Compare the two bills.  They're not much alike beyond the claim to ""solve the issue""  >The Senate rejected the House bill last year because they want it to tie it to aid to Ukraine and Israel. Since that passed anyway, why not just pass the immigration bill?  Maybe because our border has nothing to do with Ukraine and Israel?  I want a lot of things, doesn't mean I get it.  It goes to my larger point - people and politicians are more interested in *their* goals rather than actually solving a problem.  Biden spent years claiming ""He could do nothing"" and then suddenly an EO came out.  House and Senate don't want to work with each other to find an actual consensus bill.  So we're fighting over the wrong issue rather than attempting to find a way to actually restrict the inflow and backlog.",LordFoxbriar,2024-06-06T23:25:14,0
