"Look, downvote me to the oblivion…but the couple was not exactly smart about it.  It was unclear from the article if they were together before the visa expired. It sounds like they got married earlier. Why did the husband not file for the green card/adjusment of status?   Also, her overstaying the visa was really not a smart move to begin with and it sets you up for failure.  Not to mention, in the military they expedite things because of their service members duty, even to the extent of being eligible for citizenship after living overseas bc it counts as living on US soil when in the military.",Illustrious_Cut1730,2025-04-26T18:32:16,18

"You can’t legally stay in the US with an expired visa. Not sure what the point of this article is. If it’s to have a dig at the current administration, there are plenty to choose from, but this isn’t one of them.",Geordieinthebigcity,2025-04-28T02:46:59,3

"I'm still gonna go with it not being to a level where arrest and confinement is necessary (I'm posting this b4 reading the article).    They may have fucked up, but I think a summons to appear or a letter demanding they report to an immigration office would be the proper resonse.",alsatian01,2025-04-27T22:19:38,3
