RFK’s health policies are about to get their own clinical trial in real time,fulltrendypro,2025-05-01T10:41:50,38
"i..... How many tens and hundreds of thousands of Americans will die while professing zealous faith in the same Men Murdering them?  Placebo testing vaccines *Is Unethical*, especially considering the wild difference between Vaccines and other forms of pharmacological intervention.  Edit: As has been pointed out, there are already numerous establish regulations and industrial best practices that involve placebo testing vaccines.   Which now makes me think that the only reason they're announcing it as being ""Brand New"" and ""First of it's kind"" is to try to gin up fake support for them actually adding enough extra hurdles to vaccine production so as to make it impossible.   “Meet me in the middle, says the unjust man.

Are you high risk and need early access to a vaccine? Suprise! You were in the control group. LOL.,d_c_d_,2025-05-01T10:42:17,17
"Unethical AF if it's not double-blind.  You don't just give a group of people a placebo and see if that improves herd immunity.  My understanding is that he either A: Doesn't think we already do double-blind experiments, or B:  Wants studies exclusively on the placebo effect of a population for a particular condition,  before investing in vaccine research in the first place.  If the placebo effect is significant,  the vaccine research isn't important.     Basically No Child Left Behind, using the placebo effect as the testing metric for vaccine prioritization and funding/research allocation",GaimeGuy,2025-05-01T10:55:34,7
"I'm confused, isn't this already part of clinical trials needed for approval? Like Phase 1 identifies dose, phase 2 tests immune response, and phase 3 is efficacy and large scale safety compared against a control (which is just a saline shot, ie placebo)",AbsoluteRubbish,2025-05-01T11:10:02,5

"Scientist here:  This is totally fine and within norm. Not every interventional clinical trial is placebo controlled but many are. Not all vaccine administration trials are placebo controlled but many are. This is largely fine. RFK is a lunatic, don’t get me wrong, but this is the equivalent to a “oh, ok, whatever” for me.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-01T11:03:11,1
What? I’m pretty sure that all drugs undergo placebo testing already…  That’s the point - how does it compare to doing nothing.,Caeldeth,2025-05-01T16:59:39,0
"They will get exactly one round of testing.  When the results come back at how stark the contrast is between placebo and vaccine, RFK will bury the report and deny that he had the study made.",Nac_Lac,2025-05-01T10:57:14,36
"Hi, pharmacological scientist here:   Not unethical nor is this out of the norm. I’ve personally been part of a placebo controlled vaccine trial myself as a kid! When Gardasil was being trialed for young boys as well, my parents entered me. This is quite standard.  RFK is largely a lunatic but this is fine. You can check on clinicaltrials.gov for how often this occurs.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-01T10:58:56,21

"The issue here is annual flu vaccines and the like which are designed to try and get ahead of what the most likely strains will be. They aren't placebo tested each time because placebo testings already been done on the underlying components and by the time you're done placebo testing the strains you think will be problematic they're no longer the most relevant strains anymore. But RFK is probably going to consider each update as a ""new vaccine"" and thus kind of render them ineffective",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-01T11:58:41,3
"So when you say “largely,” you neglect to mention the exception is when we’re dealing with highly virulent, highly transmissive pathogens such as measles, as surely you know being the scientist that you are.",2a_lib,2025-05-01T11:14:16,5
"This is specifically to target improvements to drugs, mainly seasonal vaccines. For novel drugs or drugs meant to treat conditions for which we have no other treatments, we do test against placebo. For things like improving insulin, vaccines, or testing new drugs that treat a condition for which we already have treatments available, we test them against the current standard of care. If you want to introduce a drug, you have to demonstrate that it is either better or equivalent to the options we have available. If you want to make a new form of insulin, you need to show that your new formula meets or exceeds the current treatment available.  This new testing process is redundant for novel/lone treatments. It is absurd for regularly updated treatments, since it's treating a drug that undergoes slight modification as a new drug. Do not misunderstand, this is an attempt to rebrand covid, flu, and other vaccines as not tested to his bullshit standard and force their makers to stop making them.",D0ct0rFr4nk3n5t31n,2025-05-01T21:24:36,3
"You know more than I do on this, though I did have specifically in mind the recent news regarding the annual flu vaccine. He's now demanding additional tests for it which will likely mean it can not be ready by flu season.   In addition, while you say that it is standard on it's own, my level of trust in anyone in this administration to conduct it in an honest and data driven method is zero.   One of the means of disrupting our institutions and systems that protect us is to incrementally add hurdles, bureaucracy, and ""reasonable ideas"" until they collapse under the added weight.",Scallel,2025-05-01T11:03:15,14

"HHS said this policy will not apply to flu vaccines.  It seems to me this is just an excuse to de-authorize COVID vaccines, but who knows.",curien,2025-05-01T12:27:16,6
What makes you think Measles vaccines aren’t placebo controlled?   [Just last year](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38292039/). COVID vaccines were placebo controlled too.,EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-01T11:16:09,2
Awesome - appreciate the clarification!,Caeldeth,2025-05-01T22:04:28,3
"There's already a process for that: the COVID vaccines for example were under a emergency use authorizations, they didn't follow the standard approval process.  Either way, vaccines for new pathogens *already* routinely use placebo trials. It's generally only updated vaccines for non-novel pathogens (e.g., flu vaccines) that don't. (Although an HHS spokesperson said this policy would not apply to the flu vaccine specifically.)",curien,2025-05-01T12:24:20,5
"COVID is endemic now. Bad example. Measles *was* largely under control, so in both instances a relaxed approach could be taken toward vaccine development.",2a_lib,2025-05-01T11:22:24,2
">COVID is endemic   [It wasn’t in 2020 when Pfizer published this paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577).   > In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-01T11:23:34,0
"That was the first mRNA vaccine generally authorised for widespread use in humans, it makes sense to be more careful with something where the mechanism was far less well tested than traditional vaccines, that's clearly a false equivalence to e.g: the seasonal flu vaccine.  No one is arguing there should *never* be placebo controlled studies. People are saying that forcing there to *always* be is potentially harmful for no benefit, especially as we *know* this is a loon just trying to put as many barriers up to slow and stop vaccines as possible because he believes conspiracy theories.",ThatGuyYouSeeOnClips,2025-05-01T11:42:46,4
