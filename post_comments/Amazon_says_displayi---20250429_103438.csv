"This is truly idiotic on all fronts.  After saying that the point of the tariffs is to fix global trade imbalances, bring back manufacturing, and get Americans to buy more from within the US, and ***less*** from countries who are the biggest offenders.... The White house then has a hissy fit about a private company making efforts to provide more transparency to its customers - in a manner that could allow them to more easily track which products the US clearly doesn't want it's people spending their money on?!?!?   Were amazon to provide the information the White House claimed it was planning to provide, a consumer could compare final prices of two similar items and see that one of them has a 235% tariff applied, while they other has none (or maybe only 10%)... and they can chose then to by the good that wasn't as heavily tariffed, even if the final price is similar or even slightly more expensive.   For the White House to come out and say that providing this useful data to customers is somehow HOSTILE to the US Government is just Asinine....   Though you still have to reconcile the fact that you have Trump announcing he wants to get rid of Income tax for the vast majority of people in the country, and replace that federal income with his Tariff plans.... which would mean the white house actually DOES want Americans to buy more products from foreign countries, as a shift in purchasing to mostly US products would actually deprive the government of money it would receive were you to buy from international sources..   So maybe the tariffs were never ***about*** trade imbalance, or bringing back manufacturing, or getting Americans to buy more American products.... but was just a way to shift the tax burden of the country to the poor - who make so little money they have no federal income tax as is... but who will have no way to circumvent paying the tariff-based markups on products they need to buy to survive.

This was all smoke from the beginning.  Amazon was never going to let people know the widget they're charging $30 for was actually only $2 and the rest was mark up.  Since it was about displaying the tariff cost that's what would happen since tarrifs only apply to the cost of the item itself and not the surrounding infrastructure to sell it.

The same exact stuff; it just don‚Äôt have the fake brand name painted on it, which I prefer anyway.  Unless you‚Äôre buying name brand stuff (which I wouldn‚Äôt buy from AliExpress because it‚Äôll be fake), you can ditch Amazon and go straight to the source. Why give Bezos a cut for literally the same products?  Prices over there haven‚Äôt gone up yet. No idea why. I expect they will eventually, but everything is still dirt cheap right now.  And yes, I realize for many people the answer is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shop online; buy from brick and mortar,‚Äù but hardly anyone is going to change their habits beyond using a different app to buy the cheap stuff they want.

"Let's be honest here - Amazon isn't backing down on this because of the White House, it's because it was never possible in the first place for the majority of goods.  Let me explain simply. Most goods on Amazon are not actually sold by Amazon, with over 60% of the goods on Amazon being sold by 3rd parties. These 3rd parties import the goods on their own, slap on their own mark-up, and then list the goods for sale on Amazon. Unless these 3rd parties report their mark-up it's impossible to tell what tariff they paid on the original item.   For example, a MAGA hat is selling for $100 with its ""made in China"" label. Does that mean that tariff was $59? No, because the MAGA hat ordered from China for $1, plus $1.45 in tariffs, and then the seller added their markup of $98.55. Less shipping and handling of $5 per hat the seller makes $93.55 per MAGA hat.   Did anyone seriously think that the 3rd party sellers on Amazon were going to willingly disclose that the MAGA hats only cost $1? No.  Likewise Amazon isn't going to disclose its massive mark-ups on its own goods either. It would wake US consumers up to how much they're being ripped off on a daily basis and how the problems with prices in the USA have very little to do with tariffs and actual costs, and instead are mostly to do with billionaires ripping them off.",Wise_Monkey_Sez,2025-04-29T20:52:28,1

"The import duties were also fairly static, though - with how often Trump is changing his mind and throwing tantrums to manipulate the market, showing the duty at time of purchase makes sense because it's no longer a fixed, understood cost.  Other online retailers handling pre-orders are actually checking at the time of shipment whether the customer still wants the item with duties at time of shipment applied as a separate line item because, using right now as an example, it spikes the price of an item that could be hundreds of dollars to more than double that.  Besides - taking this the other way around:  wouldn't seeing the tariff be a nice incentive for them to realize how heavily they're being penalized for buying _dirty, filthy, stinky foreign goods_ and buy American? That's allegedly the entire point of this performative political stunt Trump is pulling.  If anything he should be proudly showing those surcharges to encourage people to follow his hamfisted policies.  All this outrage tells us is that he is mad when people know the actual nature of the numbers he proudly waves around on television, and how the other country doesn't pay it - the consumer does.  That's the ignorance he's manipulating people with via _his_ political stunt.  How dare anyone criticize that? /s  He has no reason to be crying like a spoilt child about this other than he knows his policy is shit and people don't/won't like it, but he doesn't want you to know because he can't stand his grift being ruined or facing any consequences for being moron.",ippa99,2025-04-29T16:10:15,1

A tariff, on the other hand, is a tax, and I believe that when we are charged a tax we have the right to know how much that is.

"That's a very fair question. It's a shame nobody has an answer to that. Well except me; I'll answer. But you're not gonna like it. XD  There's this thing called ""virtue signaling"" that the Internet is very good at. It's when the Internet says ""I don't really understand things like macroeconomics and the completely pervasive reach of modern mega-corporations, but I don't like them because what they're doing sounds morally reprehensible.""   And that's... that's on okay thing to say. And likely true. But also unhelpful. Especially when they say that thing from their Apple/Samsung phones, while sitting in traffic in their Ford/Toyota/Tesla, on their way to Whole Foods (guess who owns that \^\^) because they sure as fuck aren't supporting Walmart.  I don't wanna come down on boycotting as a philosophical principle, because I appreciate what it's ultimate goal is. It's noble. But in the current economic system we live in (and really most before it), it's marginally successful at best and performative at worst.  So that's the part of the answer you're not gonna like, but I hate to leave you with that. That feels awful! :(   Here would be my ""real world"" recommendation to you. Keep buying at Walmart and Amazon. Keep surviving in the modern world. But take advantage of the cost savings you can make happen and put that money into something that will do some good for the world around you. Give that money back to the community (well, maybe not *your* community XD). No, seriously, give that money to food banks and charities that can use their own networks and resources to make the most out of your buck for the lives of those around you.

I've always thought that they should have shown history on all it's darkness. I'm sorry but fuck trigger warnings. You need to show pictures of people who were hung in Sun down cities. You need to show the corpses of black Americans. Recordings of them speaking about being brutalized. Black Americans beaten, bleeding, or dead on the streets. The same for Germany and the Holocaust. Not just mention it in a fucking packet. None of this don't be ashamed bullshit. You should feel bad and be ashamed of past America. Should you let it make you pointless? Not entirely but it should make you want to be better to make America better. And if they saw the brutality understood what their fore fathers fought for worker rights. As the Pinkertons came out. Perhaps they'd have given a shit. Or been scared enough to see all this as bad. But instead of we get milctose history lessons where the teachers can't show in depth what happened. In fear of some pussy parent bitching that it made their child or themselves feel bad and uncomfortable.   History and the world is uncomfortable and often brutal. And without that true understanding this shit happens.   Sadly it's also happened because other than Pearl Harbor most of America sat cozy and safe. We weren't bombed daily by the Axis. We didn't see millions die in front of us. Or our homes reduced to rubble. Our children sent away for safety. And without that context history is really going to repeat itself. Unfortunately outside 911 most of America hasn't experienced real discomfort or trouble in the same way that Europe and the Middle East have.   In Europe it was hard to lie about fascism and that stuff because they fucking lived in Germany they still have things blown to rubble to remember the past. And what they did.

"> They itemize it with sales tax, I don't see why tariffs should be different.  Showing price before sales tax is the norm across almost all of retail, and done in part to make comparison shopping easier (the tax rate varies by jurisdiction, but the base retail price should be the same).  I have *opinions* on that, of course. In some places including all sales taxes is the norm. But not in the US.   Including the cost of any import tariffs has never been the norm in the U.S. in retail. **Tariffs are not new.** For instance, I believe the import tariffs on guitars from Japan hovered around 10% prior to all this. On a $1,000 guitar, that is substantial. Did Guitar Center go out of their way to post the amount of a Japanese Fender Mustang guitar attributable to import tariffs?   No. The price was the price, it was on the customer to compare the price of the Japanese model to the Mexican and American models and decide which they preferred to buy.  With no specific information given by the vendor about how much of that price tag (if any) was specifically just import tariffs.   I get it, people are fired up about this politically. *Me too!* But yeah, this is not and has never been a norm.

I mean, when you can pay 98c for some noodles at Walmart as opposed to three-fitty at a local grocer, I mean, what can you realistically do when you're on a budget?  But again, that's nothing new to Trump's first or second term, or the presidential terms before or in the middle, and hopefully(ish?) the one after (I'll take a still-standing democracy over lower-priced consumer goods is what I'm saying, though it'd be nice to have both). Corporate retailers have the consumer base by the sensitive bits. Boycotting is far more luxury than it used to be.

"Not tricky but I see where the confusion came from because... I can't think of any time before today where I've seen someone say ""+1.5x""   Like I'll concede I haven't checked any style guides or Googled preferred conventions but this feels like the *least* helpful way to present it, especially when you offered it as like a further clarification beyond the 145%. Saying +1.5x is, however clunky, the same as saying +150% (as opposed to the total being 150% of the original price), at which point you're practically clarifying by doing the equivalent of saying ""that's 1/10th, which is essentially 10/100!"". You're literally just expressing the same thing in an *extremely similar way*, so it doesn't do much to make the point more accessible. Mathematically literate people got it straight away from the percentage, and the ""+1.5x"" was likely of less value than saying ""2.5x"" for someone that didn't get the percentage.¬†   All of which is a very very long winded way of saying you're not wrong but at the same time it's a weird way to choose to be right ü§∑üèª",Pokemon_Name_Rater,2025-04-29T14:25:11,7

"That‚Äôs not why occupy was ridiculed.  Occupy was ridiculed because it was an unorganized mess with no gameplan.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest struggles on the left is the lack of real organization of the most progressive elements.  We can organize a protest, sure, but real voter outreach is less sexy.  Additionally, much of the far left actively rebuke and turn their nose at any attempts to try and organize the left into anything beyond the Democratic Party and a bunch of disparate groups.  The reality of the situation is that you will not have a successful progressive movement in America without the Democratic Party and too many leftists and progressives refuse to compromise on their values and vote consistently or at all.  But, they‚Äôll definitely bitch online and complain about the Democratic Party.",sk8nteach,2025-04-29T17:37:45,8

"I can't remember where I first read it, but there are a lot of articles about Tony West advising her. Most seem to be behind paywall but here is an [opinion piece](https://www.commondreams.org/news/mark-cuban-kamala-harris) that quotes an article from the Atlantic.  >While Harris was stuck defending the Biden economy, and hobbled by lingering anger over inflation, attacking Big Business allowed her to go on the offense. Then, quite suddenly, this strain of populism disappeared. One Biden aide told me that Harris steered away from such hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer. (West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) To win the support of CEOs, Harris jettisoned a strong argument that deflected attention from one of her weakest issues. Instead, the campaign elevated Mark Cuban as one of its chief surrogates, the very sort of rich guy she had recently attacked.",Morlik,2025-04-29T15:06:53,2

Facts. The way you make Democrats further left is to infiltrate their ranks and shift them from within‚Ä¶ not by criticizing them from the sidelines while proudly boasting that you refuse to vote for them.  Pragmatism and incremental change is way fucking better than moving in the opposite direction because the infinitely shittier option wins from your inaction.,badger0511,2025-04-29T20:13:46,7
