"Not surprised to see Gillibrand is a co-sponsor on the bill. She was also one of the main senators rallying Dems to vote for cloture on the R budget bill a while back, thus refusing to shut the government down over DOGE and all the other nonsense coming out of this administration. For being such a left-leaning state, NY has two of the biggest problems on the Democratic side of the senate right now. (No offense to any New Yorkers out there.)  I am more surprised (and disappointed) to see Angela Alsobrooks as a co-sponsor. Don't know much about her since she's only been in office for a few months. But this doesn't seem like a good start.",Bitter-Flounder-3546,2025-05-07T17:41:08,5
