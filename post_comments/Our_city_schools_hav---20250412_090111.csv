They do not care about human beings. They only care about the wealthy.,SweaterSteve1966,2025-04-12T09:07:04,108
This tracks with the current administration. Think about it. Many of the public school students are lower income.  This is another example of their “kill the poor” strategy.,braeburn-1918,2025-04-12T10:11:33,80
"I guess this is one way for people to learn what our government does for us that we have taken for granted.  Every day, people will see more and more departments eliminated and suddenly realize why they existed in the first place.",TeamHope4,2025-04-12T10:21:10,33

DOGE’s official stance is “Fuck dem kids”.  They do not care and enjoy hurting others to show them who’s boss.,ParadiddlediddleSaaS,2025-04-12T09:53:51,31
Lead poisoning=more Trump voters.,no_bender,2025-04-12T11:31:31,13
"Biden made it one of his biggest missions to eliminate lead poisoning in children and families. So I'm sure that this is not even just DOGE cutting spending, Trump likely is pro-lead poisoning out of his usual pettiness.",sweetempoweredchickn,2025-04-12T12:24:49,13
"2 things to note.   1) Lead pipes primarily affect inner city or minority-majority school districts, so by default the admin is not going to care.  2) It's really the gun lobby that wanted that department shuttered.",GardenWeasel67,2025-04-12T11:49:11,9

Let's see what happens in the midterms. If we don't turn out in numbers sufficient to defeat any rigging (and obviously throw the bums out!) we'll have no right to complain.,Fit-Struggle-9882,2025-04-12T14:44:51,4

"They don’t even care about the wealthy, they care only about money!  You could be a billionaire and if you aren’t putting money into trump’s pockets, he doesn’t care about you either.",_Angel_3,2025-04-12T16:08:55,23

"Because over time, the building starts to fall apart, and as it ages, the risk of lead exposure gets higher.  Until recently, the risk was negligible, not to mention water testing takes a while and isn't done but once every few years, especially in public schools.  So yeah, they're just now finding out about it.",aaron_adams,2025-04-12T12:09:05,9
"It is currently a scandal in Milwaukee that dangerous levels of lead contamination were *recently* discovered in our public school system and weren't addressed properly and put students and staff at risk.   That said, your comment is ridiculous.   >how is that suddenly a crisis that needs to be dealt with today  Whatever happened in the past, they are trying to deal with it *now* and they can't get the proper help from the CDC. I have no idea what you are even trying to imply. That they should not deal with it today?",undercurrents,2025-04-12T14:02:25,6

"I'm saying, public officials dropped the damn ball for decades because Asbestos has pretty much been banned for decades especially in schools. There is plenty to blame on trump and his henchmen. This one, not so much.",Woody_CTA102,2025-04-12T15:02:59,-3
"Yeah, we're talking 30 years of more in this case. My guess is they've known about the lead for years, maybe decades. At least I hope so.",Woody_CTA102,2025-04-12T10:52:56,2
"Wow, really going over your head here, huh? Literally no one said Trump or his administration *caused* the asbestos. Plus, no building was painted with asbestos recently. Because, you know, banned. But paint starts chipping away after years exposing the asbestos, which is what is happening now. But because of Trump and RFK, the entire branch of the CDC that Milwaukee reached out to for public health triage and outreach no longer exists because RFK cut that branch.   It's pretty straightforward yet somehow flying right over you.",undercurrents,2025-04-12T15:42:38,5
