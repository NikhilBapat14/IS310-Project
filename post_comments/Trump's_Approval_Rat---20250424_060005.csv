"By Anna Commander - Deputy News Editor:   President Donald Trump's approval rating is in the negatives with nearly all key groups, a new poll from Pew Research Center finds.  In the poll, Trump has an overall approval rating of 40 percent compared to a disapproval rating of 59 percent. The survey shows that 44 percent of men approve of the job the president is doing compared to 55 percent who disapprove.

"This is a great sign but not enough. Nothing will get better until enough Republicans have enough spine to openly and publicly criticize DJT and actually vote against him.   I generally assume there will 2-3 republicans that vote against DJT on major issues. Murkowski is clearly the first person to openly admit she is afraid to use her voice out of fear of reprisals. That by itself is crazy. It is true Nazi level stuff when a member of DJT's own party fears speaking out against him. I assume if there was other support, Collins would vote against him. Really, they need someone bigger with national significance to turn against him openly so less known  or less powerful elected officials have someone to stand behind. I don't foresee that happening.  The worst part is the clear lack of concern from so many that DJT is violating numerous federal court orders including the Supreme Court and nothing is happening. If a normal citizen openly violated a federal court order, they would be held in contempt. Its incredible evidence showing one of the points of the BLM movement that there is a dual justice system. You have money  and/power, you can stay out of trouble.   I just done foresee enough people being willing to stand up to DJT when it counts. Its the same reason Hitler came into power. Propaganda convinces people to be fearful. People just look the other way out of self preservation. ""Good Germans"" are shining examples.",TheDarkHelmet1985,2025-04-24T07:06:08,3

Yeah even a lot (5-10%) of republicans will say “I don’t like trump” (but I like all of his policies and he is correct about everything - I just don’t like him”.,patentattorney,2025-04-24T07:08:54,83
"It's part of the narrative. And I don't mean so much like this is what they want you to believe, as much as all stories about Trump are treated and covered like they are a storyline in a TV show. The narrative of this episode, type of thing. That's why so many headlines have to paint him a certain way, otherwise there's little narrative motion because he's not really someone who changes much. Like, he gets worse, but those aren't the narratives that sell. That's boring.  I'll give you an example. A month or two back, the Washington Post ran a headline that read ""Trump's dark anti-Ukraine *turn.*"" (emphasis my own). So, in order for that headline to even **make sense** it would require Trump to have ever supported Ukraine (he didn't, he hasn't) and to now have such a markedly different response to them that it could constitute a ""turn"" (he hasn't). But that isn't the case! This is the guy who got impeached during his first term for withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to try to extort them into saying they were opening an investigation into Joe Biden (they didn't). He has never supported Ukraine. How can we say he *turned* if the place he's currently at is just further down the straight line he was always facing? That's not what turn means!  But a story that (accurately) says ""Trump sucked on Ukraine before, he still sucks on Ukraine now, and he will continue to suck until he's dead,"" just doesn't have that narrative interest. If it was a reality show, sure, it's interesting to see two people beef, but what if they first liked each other and got along, and then they fall out? Yeah, that's the money. And that's how Trump is covered. So many headlines mindread his empty head and paint a picture of some much more normal and rational Trump (which benefits him), so they can then say ""only now, right now, has he gone too far! Only now has he changed!"" But more often than not he hasn't, he's just doing the same bullshit he always was (though often to a worse degree).  It's pernicious shit. You could try to tell a young person ""actually Trump has been shit the whole time"" but they're seeing a flood of stuff that sanewashes him and implies he was once capable, which then primes them for some MAGA chud to go on about lying liberals.

"No there has been real movement. He had gotten the traditional post election bounce, he was above water and had some of his highest approvals ever in the run up to the election and after the inauguration. It's what led to some high profile institutions simply bowing to him in the last few months and the lack of fight from some Democrats -- For some reason serious people in media and politics thought he'd solved his popularity problem for all time.   And since then they've collapsed much faster than his previous term and much faster than Biden. He's now officially the least popular president at this point in his term of all time.   This is a significant collapse in how he's viewed politically. I didn't think this would happen until August. That it's happening in April is actually pretty significant.  And much more importantly is he'd always been really durable on the economy, and his economic numbers are some of the worst he's ever gotten. So his one key strength is being destroyed. And immigration is following behind.  If those two strengths become weaknesses, he's the least popular President in history and it isn't even close.",rage_panda_84,2025-04-24T07:50:49,35

Regular average Americans haven't been impacted by his policies as much as the rich so it makes sense for his approval rating to exist.

"Without sounding conspiracy theoristic... 40% GOP approval > 40% Dem approval.  There tends to be a slight conservative bias in many electoral systems, based on 2 common trends:   \- rural areas tend to vote conservative, urban areas vote more liberal  \- urban areas are growing faster than rural areas, and attract more inward migration.  Combine these two facts, and it means that - unless the system is constantly being carefully tweaked - lower-population, conservative areas will end up being over-represented and higher population, liberal areas being under-represented.

The honeymoon period also generally hinges on the fact that a president usually spends their first 100 days focused on popular things that they supported during the election. They go and get those things through congress and their approval rating stays high for awhile.   Trump jumped straight to chaos and to things that aren't actually that popular. Its a shame too many of our voters were so stupid they voted for this shit they don't actually want because they either weren't paying attention or were more concerned about the 5 trans kids playing sports,fcocyclone,2025-04-24T15:02:26,8

"You are absolutely right about this, but also, 40% approval was his floor during his first term, and it never really got lower than that no matter what he did. Other presidents haven't fallen so fast, but they've fallen lower than Trump ever has. George W's approval rating got down to 25% late in his second term, and HW got down to 29%.
