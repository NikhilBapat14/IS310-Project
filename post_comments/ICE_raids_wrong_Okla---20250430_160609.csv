">""ICE was carrying out a court authorized search warrant for a large-scale human smuggling investigation. The case has been accepted for federal prosecution in the Northern District of Oklahoma,” a senior DHS official told *The Independent*. ""The search warrants included the location of an address where U.S. citizens recently moved. The previous residents were the intended targets. The investigation resulted in the indictment of eight Guatemalan nationals for their roles in smuggling illegal aliens into the United States. Two of the eight indicted aliens have criminal convictions for narcotics possession, identity fraud, money laundering, and re-entry after deportation.""  Nothing in this statement addresses the reason they decided to traumatize an innocent family without checking first that they had the right people. And nothing in this statement explains why they decided to **steal the money and possessions of innocent people and not give them back!** Wtf!! Stealing is normally illegal, but in this case, it's okay? (I understand that if someone's accused of a crime, evidence needs to be collected. But in this case, it was discovered that the family was innocent, so what's the excuse?)",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T16:59:27,66

"I mean the story says they had a search warrant for the house, but were unaware that the people they were looking for had moved out and these people had moved in. Beyond that it was for a child human trafficking ring. (Which arrested 20 others) While it should had been done with more class. The officer got there and probably saw exactly what they expected, a small home (that was partially moved into) and small children. One would expect traffickers to have access to fake IDs as well.  This seems more like a run of the mill human error. Then anything super newsworthy, or done with particular maliciousness. Obviously, the victims here should get some compensation, as anyone should when these mistakes happen.",Adrewmc,2025-04-30T16:12:43,-64
"That’s the fun part of civil asset forfeiture. You don’t even have to be guilty to have “suspicious” property seized because the property’s “suspiciousness” is all the justification needed.  “Why, if not for illegal purposes, would you have $10k in cash?” “I don’t trust banks and am going to buy a used car in cash.” “Hmmm, nope there is no legitimate reason for $10k in cash to be in one place. It has to come with us.”",Wise-Reference-4818,2025-04-30T17:45:57,52
"Exactly!! One would think that federal agents working on such a serious case would have conducted surveillance on the location before getting the warrant issued to make sure their targets were still there. This is a basic concept in Search Warrant 101. Also, unless things are different in OK, aren’t the agents required to leave a copy of the warrant and also an inventory of the items they seized, along with contact information?",Topher92646,2025-04-30T18:59:50,8

"What do you have to say about the fact the agents, after determining that the person the warrant was for wasn't one of the people they rousted from the house, went ahead and stole all their electronics and cash and left with it? Because when they left they knew that those weren't the person they were after. Why rob them blind and keep the money? Did they even turn any of the money into evidence? Somehow I doubt that they did. They likely split it up amongst themselves and who knows where they ditched the laptops and phones. In every legal sense those agents committed armed robbery.",noncongruent,2025-04-30T16:34:02,36
"> Obviously, the victims here should get some compensation  There's currently a SCOTUS case that's probably going to say that they can't very soon.

"Well, do we know all the facts here. Imagine you’re running an operation, and you have 13 houses, what you observe is 20-30 people switching between them with children in a ring, bad guys we all agree. What happens next, they move out which is normal because they never really move in, then this family comes in, they have 2 small children and $20k cash in the house.   ….sort of fits the descriptions pretty well doesn’t it.   So it’s exactly what you expect for child traffickers to have. Yeah…I’m probably going to continue the search too if I’m the cops. And not worry that one second if maybe…this one couple actually have nothing to do with it.

"Surprisingly enough there's actually less conditions for that.  Look up civil asset forfeiture, allows law enforcement to seize assets with just suspicion of a crime and no charges.  I've seen coverage of a bunch of cases where just traveling by car or in the airport with a large amount of cash was considered suspicious enough for the cash to be seized.  In order to get it back you will typically need to fight in court, and the lawyer fees make it not worth it most of the time even if you have a solid case.  After law enforcement possesses the money for a certain amount of time they just get to keep it.  Its absolutely terrible, been a problem for a long time now.",Afro_Future,2025-04-30T19:01:30,2

"Your house is being searched because it’s been suspected of housing a human trafficking ring.   I enter the house, is see large amounts of cash, and hear small children. So I continue the search. Through the eyes of an officer he may be expecting an armed assailant.   They got there late, the people had left before they did the search, the wrong people were there.

They'll probably photoshop MST-3K tattoos on the kids' knuckles and call it a day.,noncongruent,2025-04-30T17:19:59,9
"In the other cases there was at least the hint of probable cause that the money was being used in the furtherance of a crime. In other words, they can't just walk up to you while you're minding your own business in your house and simply steal your stuff. If they'd had a warrant alleging that the family was doing something illegal that would give the agents the excuse to seize the money, but they weren't. The only reason the agents were even there is because they had a bad warrant, and in fact the agents recognized the warrant was bad and let the family go. Since they used guns and the threat of violence to take the money, laptops, phones, etc, and did so without a warrant or legitimate reason to be in the house in the first place, they committed armed robbery. It's really simple, most people with even a rudimentary understanding of how law and the Constitution works would quickly grasp this fact. I mean, I did, it's the first thing that stood out to me.",noncongruent,2025-04-30T17:38:36,4
"> **suspected** of housing a human trafficking ring.   There's where the whole argument falls apart. They weren't even the suspects as well.

"I'm saying they don't really need any solid justification.  They can legally seize it by just claiming suspicion of the asset being associated with a crime (they make a distinction from claiming the person is under suspicion of a crime, part of what makes it possible).  To prove that they didn't actually have grounds to seize it you need to go to court.  The legal battle often costs more than the actual asset, so it ends up not being worth fighting most of the time.  I agree with you that they shouldn't have taken these peoples money, just like traveling with money doesn't justify taking it.  Regardless, they are legally able to do this, and it puts the victims in a lose lose situation where they just have to hope the government shows mercy 99% of the time.",Afro_Future,2025-04-30T19:39:53,-1

"No, sometimes there is no probable cause. A guy is carrying a bunch of cash in his car. Maybe he wants to buy something for cash, or maybe he has some other reason. It's not smart, but it's not illegal. The cops pull him over, and tell him it's drug money and take it. Then he has to try and get it back, if he even has the resources to do that. The whole point is that it's unconstitutional. That's why various groups have been trying to get it reformed.",bestleftunsolved,2025-04-30T19:46:11,3
"Yes, I get that. But you still have slightly more control over that situation than they did here, minuscule thou it may be. These people had literally zero control over this.",doradedboi,2025-04-30T19:40:42,3
"I'm well aware of the misuse of civil forfeiture, but the point I've been trying to make is that it doesn't apply in this specific case. In this specific case nobody was traveling, nobody was pulled over, nobody was suspected of committing a crime or having money gained from illegal activities. Everything you say is correct about other times when it's been used, but those same exact points are irrelevant here. This time it was straight up armed robbery. That's all it was, all it is, and all it will ever be. ICE will never attempt to make a claim it was taken under civil forfeiture laws, because the thefts weren't committed under those laws. All the claims that someone can make otherwise are truly irrelevant.",noncongruent,2025-04-30T20:28:32,2
