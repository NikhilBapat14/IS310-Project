"I agree with her on this. I am not here to be friends to my children. I am here to raise and love them, keep my daughter off the pole and my son from being a father at 15.",Iamstillhere44,2025-05-09T18:26:09,58

Gentle parenting and friend parenting has always been more of a hippy dippy liberal bag of nonsense. Don’t get me wrong conservative parents also frequently go wrong but the “afraid my kid won’t like me” bs is almost always liberal,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T17:10:07,4

"Same. Be their parent, not their 'friend'.",bjohn15151515,2025-05-09T16:50:00,45
The two aren’t mutually exclusive. True friendship means you help guide each other to live better lives. True friends reprimand each other whenever the other does something wrong. A parent can do all of these things.,Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-09T16:55:26,-18
"True parenting means you are in charge and responsible for the upbringing of your child. You should always protect and sacrifice for your child. These same things are not the responsibility of the child for the parent. If/when you have kids, you'll understand that difference.",bjohn15151515,2025-05-09T17:04:56,33
"Obviously there are certain situations in which the relationship between a child and their parents differs from the relationship between two peers.   I’m talking about general traits one associates with friendship. A parent should enjoy spending time with their kid, they should want to be involved in their child’s life, they should be open and honest about what they are feeling, they should encourage their child to be the best they can be.   Many of these things are not exclusive to the parents and their actions towards their child. A child can and should want to spend time with their parents. A child should want to be involved in their parent’s life. A child should be open and honest with their parents about their feelings. A child should encourage their parents to be the best they can be.   The dynamic of the relationship between children and their parents also changes as both parties mature. What you would consider friendship with a peer is something that can happen between a parent and their child after the child has reached adulthood whereas the relationship between a parent and their child should be more mentor like in the child’s formative years.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-09T18:19:04,10
