Has she actually **been** released or has she just been _ordered_ to be released?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T15:48:33,15

"It is a relief, but doesn't come close to resolving the injustice.  I hope she gets the as much press coverage as she may desire to tell her story and express her opinions.  She should also have standing to sue civilly for false imprisonment, in addition to criminal charges being pressed against her abductors.",duzies,2025-05-09T15:48:10,4
so glad to see her release. Her detention by ICE was unjust.,MiHop89,2025-05-09T15:46:16,2
"~~she was released immediately, she was in the court's custody at the time, not ICE.~~  edit: the video I saw was of the lawyer walking out, mislabeled as her. it's fucked up we have to do this shit in trump's america",PM_ME_DPRK_CANDIDS,2025-05-09T16:39:40,5
"Good question...I read the title and the line ""today we are celebrating her release..."" and assumed she had been released.  But given Trump's disdain for the rule of law it's very conceivable he will defy this court along with all the other courts (including SCOTUS of course) he continues to defy.",duzies,2025-05-09T16:53:44,2

"She's been ordered released, but I can't find anything indicating she's *actually* been released, nor can I find anything indicating she's even still in the country.",noncongruent,2025-05-09T16:34:01,5
"She definitely was not released immediately, and there's no confirmation that she's been released at all.  The court had a brief status hearing at 4:50 PM EDT (an hour ago as I write this,) and as of then she had not been released.  https://bsky.app/profile/annabower.bsky.social/post/3lorehk5qes2v  **EDIT:** She was [released for real](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/bail-hearing-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana/3708999/?at) shortly after I posted this comment.",Stenthal,2025-05-09T16:50:20,6
