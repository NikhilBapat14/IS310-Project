They’re being used as part of a slave trade it seems like. They’re being accepted by some oil baron there that isn’t even official government if we are to believe his meeting with the Trump team in the past few days means anything,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T10:18:30,23
"> The officials, who requested anonymity, said the US military could fly migrants to the North African country as early as this week. >  > The move is likely to spark controversy - Libya has been mired in conflict for more than a decade and the US state department advises Americans not to travel there due to factors like crime, terrorism and civil unrest.  The amount of cruelty this administration has released in just a few months is terrifying.This headline reads like something out of a dystopian nightmare.  [El Salvador was bad enough](https://uwcg.substack.com/p/el-salvador-bukele-and-cecot?r=575hij) but Rubio, once considered to be one of the 'compassionate conservatives' is the one grinnin' and eager to ship dissenters off to camps",UWCG,2025-05-07T10:13:21,13

These are the huge deals he is making! Spending our money to deport people to places with human rights issues or that have conflicts without due process.
