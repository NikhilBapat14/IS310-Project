"I think that PRIVATE foundations should be able to give out scholarships to whoever they want.  But that means EVERYONE gets to do so.  If someone wants to give scholarships to poor white trash or black gang members from Chicago, they should be able to. If someone wants to give scholarships to only people descended from Irish Immigrants - so be it.  But publicly funded schools should not be able to discrimate like this.  Make them merit based or need based only.",scrapqueen,2025-04-25T18:33:28,1
