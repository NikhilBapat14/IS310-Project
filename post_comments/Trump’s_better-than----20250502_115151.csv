"This is the first example I've seen of anything positive about the jobs report. *maybe* you could justify ""less terrible than expected""?   Literally everything is linking economic and job conditions to an impending recession.",Spam_Hand,2025-05-02T11:53:19,17
"This has the same energy as when people claim gasoline has come back down to $3.50 after it jumped to $4.00/g from $3.00/g  It's ""better"" only so far as it isn't as bad as it could be, but it's still really really bad.",ERedfieldh,2025-05-02T12:00:29,12
"Sorry, that's Biden's job report.   Trump said just the other day that this is Biden's economy.",-Poliwrath-,2025-05-02T12:16:10,10

Last week Trump said it was the Biden economy causing stocks to drop.,Anxious-Dig-5736,2025-05-02T12:27:35,2
Lmao. Unemployment remains unchanged from Biden at 4.3% and Trump is already claiming a big victory as if he totally changed the economy to better.,androgp,2025-05-02T12:42:49,2
"I think it’s all very interesting. I really do try to check my biases but there’s not way I can see that we are not about to face a massive supply chain problem and huge price hikes as the largest tax hike in history takes hold. It’s an illegal tax hike too, according to the constitution.",MiniBanjo,2025-05-02T12:14:16,1
"Trump claimed that this is still Bidens economy, just a few days ago... So good or bad , Biden should get the claim on this one",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-02T13:22:49,1
" 177,000 added jobs and unemployment remained unchanged at 7,200,000 people.   So we’re adding jobs at a slightly faster rate than people are losing jobs?",cedarhat,2025-05-02T12:08:50,1
I've actually been seeing people IRL celebrate eggs costing $7 because it's down from the $12 it was two months ago and they don't care that it was $3 last year.,CassadagaValley,2025-05-02T13:55:29,1
