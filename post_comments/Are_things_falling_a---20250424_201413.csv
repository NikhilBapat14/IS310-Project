That tends to happen when you implement an agenda almost tailor made to tick off anyone who isn't either wealthy or racist.   Politics runs on goodwill. If you run that into the ground it's only a matter of time until you're fighting battles on all fronts.,NoCoolNameMatt,2025-04-24T20:27:36,50

"What worries me is he has done about as bad a job as you can possibly do as president and his ratings are still in the 40‚Äôs.    Other than revoking 2A, admitting to 100 abortions, pissing on the American flag whilst punching a bald Eagle live on stage I am not sure he could do anything which would result in any real consequence.",WestleyMc,2025-04-25T03:19:05,1

Absolutely this. I‚Äôve seen so many subs recently that have nothing to do with politics but are being forced to cause of some cancellations or something. Sure he has a massive cult but the majority of Americans just want to tune out politics and now everything they are doing is being hurt.,UncannyCharlatan,2025-04-24T20:29:12,20

"It's economics too. So the President has some, but not much power to make things better for the common folk. However the President does have the power and influence to make things worse. Just like with covid this guy yet again chose the wrong route. Cutting jobs, causing uncertainty, tariffs, spending money on golf, not delivering on bold promises. He had days after being sworn in to make some change. He failed miserably and took us down the tunes.  The sad thing is...if we ever have elections again, it's going to take a hell of a lot of work to get us out of this mess.",Northstar0566,2025-04-25T02:04:09,2

He's a fascist dictator of course public opinion won't constrain him.  He has been in office less then 100 days and has managed to fuck up the entire government and our countries standing with the entire world. He's got at least four years more of this shit to go.,Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-24T21:08:28,7

Maybe people will stop tuning out politics now?  The main thing authoritarian regimes don't want the population talking about is politics. The majority of Americans seem to have obeyed in advance on that one.,ResignedFate,2025-04-24T21:10:06,14

"the stock market will very likely restrain him.  Tanking that (like he is currently doing) will make all of his wealthy supporters very angry.  We just saw some group of CEOs go yell at him about China tariffs, because store shelves are going to be empty in about a month.",b101101b,2025-04-25T01:00:17,1

"I mean no shade, but that might just be observation bias speaking. America has 320 million people, yet a whole 5.5 million of those showed up to protest on April 5th. I can guarantee there are *many* more who know what‚Äôs going on, but chose not to attend. The most common reason for that being work. People live busy nowadays. Workers rights are so scuffed that missing out on a single day can put a risk to your job. Inflation also got a lot of us clinging desperately to that üí∏  Im not going to deny that we aren‚Äôt talking about it and revolting as much as we should. But I do believe the illusion of normalcy floating around whenever you go outside is just because people can‚Äôt put everything down to fully dedicate themselves to fight.  That‚Äôs why, though, when thousands inevitably lose their jobs, healthcare or social security; Shit is about to ramp up a lot more. Trump is about to give a whole lotta people nothing to lose.",IndividualComplexity,2025-04-25T07:46:00,4
"Another question: will it constrain him *enough* and in time? Or will it be too little, too late? We still have insanely high tariffs and I'd be surprised if he didn't return to attacking Powell in a week or so. If the stock market tanks again, he could stop again, but at some point the damage will have already been done. And at some point, he could decide to fully scapegoat Powell for the economy.",Business-Catch7679,2025-04-25T06:27:49,1
