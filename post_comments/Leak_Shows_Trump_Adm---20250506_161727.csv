He has already made shocking cuts after shocking cuts that already have deadly consequences.  That headline is totally not newsworthy.,thieh,2025-05-06T16:20:36,65
"From writer Nick Allison:  I remember reading a story late last year about a nonbinary 16-year-old in Alabama who dialed the LGBTQ crisis line instead of following through on a suicide pact he and three friends had made. The 2024 election had just been called for Donald Trump, and they took it as proof that their lives didn’t count.  Kill yourself over an election? To most adults, that sounds absurd — but most adults aren’t queer teenagers in Alabama.   A counselor who understood answered, intervened, looped in the others, brought families on board — and the four kids are alive today.  More than a million LGBTQ youth have turned to this service since late 2022 — and now it’s on the chopping block.  According to a leaked draft of the Trump administration’s 2026 budget, that third option will soon be gone. The proposal eliminates all federal funding for the LGBTQ Youth Specialized Services arm of 988, effective Oct. 1, 2025.

"The media needs to stop using passive language and they needed to start doing it a decade ago.  ""Leak shows trump administration in discussions to make cuts which will have deadly consequences.""   ""Could"" makes it sound speculative by the journalist ",GaimeGuy,2025-05-06T16:52:03,26

What is shocking about Trump attacking the LGBTQ community? Seems to be a favorite with the base ad as long as you include trans folk in that the majority is happy to go along.,econoquist,2025-05-07T00:01:26,3
