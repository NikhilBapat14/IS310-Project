"140 executive orders, yet only 5 bills passed by congress. Last congress passed nearly 300 bills in two years, and *they* were seen as unproductive.  We are witnessing the Supreme Court **and** congress relinquish power and centralize all government into the executive branch.   This should concern **everyone**. Republicans can put their hands up now and enjoy the ride, but wait till the power is wielded against them.",Gingerstachesupreme,2025-04-29T20:22:51,18

Yeah because other Presidents use their first 100 days to pass bills into law through congress. Primarily because executive orders don‚Äôt actually have any power under law. They‚Äôre all sizzle and no steak. So how many actual bills has Trump passed into law? That would be a grand total of zero.,Nas_Durden,2025-04-30T07:20:22,3

He conflates quantity with quality. It makes no sense here. All he has done is sign more EO‚Äôs than any other modern president in the first 100 days. What‚Äôs he actually done other than deport actual citizens and arrest judges? Seriously as someone with an avg possibly below average intelligence I‚Äôm astounded by how many idiots not only support but love this behavior. Sad to be an American and have been for a minute. Who would‚Äôve thought a failed reality tv star/businessman would be the biggest threat to the constitution and our democracy. Oh yeah Roy fn Cohn but ‚Äúonly as a republican‚Äù.
