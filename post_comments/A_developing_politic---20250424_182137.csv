So to summarize: he stole Medicaid money from children to fund a Super PAC that campaigned on putting more black people in jail for weed.  Sack of shit.,gradientz,2025-04-24T18:25:08,548
"I wasn‚Äôt aware scandals were a thing that could negatively impact the GOP anymore. You can‚Äôt shame people into behaving differently or resigning and fading into obscurity when they‚Äôre incapable of shame and the reward for being in power is too awesome.   Not to mention, you can‚Äôt force them to resign in shame when they‚Äôve looked around and watched their peers get away with it time and again, knowing full well people will forget all about their scandal when someone else does something even worse tomorrow.",EggsAndMilquetoast,2025-04-24T18:32:17,55

"What a criminal loser couple, that was state money! So brazen.   From article: Ten million dollars of the settlement was paid directly to a non-profit group, Hope Florida.

An investigation by state lawmakers found that after receiving it, Hope Florida transferred the $10 million to two ""dark money"" political groups ‚Äî groups that aren't required to disclose their donors",Fit-Significance-436,2025-04-24T22:35:50,13

How much yall wanna bet Trump behind this?   I doubt Republicans give a damn about money going to a group that uses it to fight against weed.

‚ÄúAmong the many issues lawmakers are angry about is that the DeSantis administration didn‚Äôt tell Florida‚Äôs Legislature about the $67 million settlement or about the $10 million that went directly to a charity overseen by DeSantis‚Äô wife.‚Äù How on earth do you hide a $67 million dollar settlement?
