"I love that he had the balls to say he would have a peace deal day 1, and then all he did was cowtow to the aggressor and after a hundred days he's now pulling out the biggest weapon in this Master Negotiator's arsenal: a limp-wristed ""Hey! Stop it!""",xXBassHero99Xx,2025-04-28T01:54:44,14

"Does it matter? Ukraine isn't going to sign a deal that surrenders territory. There is no deal. Trump getting Putin to sign a fake deal is a ruse, a casus belli for Russia. ""Trump and Putin sign deal, peacemakers. Warmonger Zelinsky refuses to sign"" etc. ",alphgeek,2025-04-28T03:12:50,2

"Doesn't matter with the correct weapons, ammunition, intelligence, strategic insights, plus massive sanctions on Russian companies, oligarchs and state enterprises. Pressure on China to stem the assistance with technology. Bomb Iranian drone facilities. Above all just be clear and unambiguous that USA will not allow Russia to succeed. Russia's whole strategy is based on assumption of US not stepping up.",Swuzzlebubble,2025-04-28T04:02:51,3
Conditions that you listed weren't met even with Biden who was much more inclined to do everything he could.,sovlex,2025-04-28T04:54:53,-1
Biden was afraid of escalation and only ever did enough to help Ukraine avoid defeat. He was counting on Putin losing interest if Trump lost the election.  I certainly wouldn't expect Trump to do what I outlined but that's what he could do if he wanted to force a resolution.,Swuzzlebubble,2025-04-28T06:56:47,1
Resolution will come naturally in Sep-Oct as the summer campaign will go to its end. I'm far from being an expert in US politics but it looks like all Trump really wants is to be out of all this. I guess there are much bigger problems are waiting for his attention at home.,sovlex,2025-04-28T07:15:14,1
