way too much accountability. can't have that. that stuff is crap,CoralinesButtonEye,2025-05-07T03:19:36,62
It's absurd how quickly things are falling apart and people aren't aware or don't care. I guess I was a bit naive in thinking our institutions and pillars of justice would have a spine and fight back against authoritarianism but nope.   We are in for some very bad times.,longtermattention,2025-05-07T04:03:02,48
Can’t have those pesky body cameras when we shoot first and ask questions later! We really can’t have them when we are divvying up seized drug money before officially reporting it!,VoteQuimby24,2025-05-07T04:11:02,18

If I have to go to jury duty and it’s the cops word against a citizen I’ll say NOT Guilty for the citizen. If the cop has killed someone I’ll pick Guilty,SumuDa,2025-05-07T09:24:37,3

Wow. Just wow.  So now we are abandoning all accountability? Come on people. If our people can’t trust our law enforcement at all then this country will go strait to hell in a hand basket quick.

"Accountability?   We don' need no steenkin' accountability!  Every day in this subreddit I argue with posters who think I'm a doomer and demoralizer for saying we've been taken over by fascists.      Too bad, chumps -  wake up and smell the jackboots.    They say we'll fix it in the midterms in 2026.  Get a clue -  fascists don't allow free and fair elections.   If you want to stop this you need act now and do something more impactful than waving a few placards around.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T06:39:26,3

Clearly they vet these people and work to remediate the cultures of violence and abuses towards women and brown people otherwise we’d have an overpowered gang in every town and county with a monopoly on violence and a distrust of the community they’re engaged to protect.,zffjk,2025-05-07T10:01:30,4

So you are cooking pizzas and claiming to be a revolutionary? Shaming others also doing their jobs and trying to survive this madness? What is wrong with you that you interrupted your important pizza making to come on here and shame people while hiding that the best you can do for the revolution is flip pizzas?
