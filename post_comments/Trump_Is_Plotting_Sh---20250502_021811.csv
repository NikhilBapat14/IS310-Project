"Invasion of Taiwan in 3, 2, 1…  Perceived weakness in the White House is usually followed by stress test from our global rivals.  Carter had hostages, George W Bush had 9/11, and Russia infiltrated Ukraine under Obama’s watch.   I knew someone that staffed at the White House through five administrations. His job was mostly communicating and coordinating.  The way it works is that someone (congressional staffer, etc) brings an item to a staffer's attention. They mutually work out a simple way to communicate it to the relevant policy makers, then get on the President's schedule.  In a 10 to 20 minute interaction the matter is summarized for the president and relevant congress person, they chat and agree on goals, and their respective staffers go back to work drafting whatever needs to be drafted. These staffers are generally not policy makers, they are career civil servants that can think quickly on their feet and write very clearly on just about any subject with little direction.  They are invisible but also indispensible.   Trump is probably tired of these folks asking clarifying questions.  He's too paranoid to delegate to them, and too stupid and delusional to be effective.  So after the shock and awe we're going to have incoherent chaos seeded with mini-tyrants like Miller, Gabbard, Hegseth, and Bondi.  If nations could have epilepsy the USA would be prone to grand mal seizeures.   Someone big is going to test it.    So my money is on Taiwan.  China would instantly corner the global chip market and become the dominant power.  Trump would be tweeting in all caps that it’s all Biden’s fault from the basement of the White House.  Congress (can declare war) and the Pentagon (can do war) would be waiting for their calls to be returned.   Impeachment is not only warranted, it is essential.  Trump is lobotomizing the government.",guttanzer,2025-05-02T09:02:37,6
