"Am I the only one who no longer trusts the numbers coming out of this administration?  [Top 10 American Corporations Disabled by China’s Pullout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Q5Nmq45DM)  Hundreds of thousands of government workers have been fired, tens of thousands of manufacturing and other jobs relating to imports have gone away - and they want me to believe job growth is strong?  I'm not buying it.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-03T07:59:34,15

"They just keep moving the goalpost back and calling it an achievement.   Are they going to call job losses an achievement eventually like ""hey you didn't lose as many jobs as we expected!""",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-03T08:44:26,4
Don't they usually get corrected downward anyways? I know it happened quite a few times even under Biden,blues111,2025-05-03T07:56:24,2
I agree. How many people have been fired or laid-off by DOGE? How much money has the government saved by this carnage? No stats.,mfeldmannRNE,2025-05-03T08:28:57,6
Like every hotel in Los Vegas has laid of 50% of their staff with more expected.  Hell they are closing buffets because there isn’t enough tourists and the food is going bad,Cyndakill88,2025-05-03T08:38:30,4
"The numbers weren’t legit when they came out of Biden’s admin either. They’re just worse now.  Systemic under and unemployment (and media gaslighting about it not existing) has been made a permanent feature of the American economy, and it’s part of why MAGA has had a fertile ground to sow lies and division.",Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-03T11:23:58,1
This is the most important statement here. What in Hell makes us think we should ever trust numbers coming out of this Administration about anything?,Deinosoar,2025-05-03T08:56:22,5

Tariffs (AKA:  Import Taxes) might have something to do with it:  Tariffs go up - prices go up.  Prices go up - sales go down.  Sales go down - profits go down.  Profits go down - companies cut back or go under.  Companies cut back or go under - people lose jobs.  People lose jobs - sales go down (even more).  Sales go down (even more) - profits go down (even more).  Profits go down (even more) - more companies cut back or go under.  More companies cut back or go under - even more people lose their jobs.  The whole thing becomes a death spiral - which leads to a depression.  Unless Congress acts to stop it - things are going to get much much worse.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-03T16:37:18,2
