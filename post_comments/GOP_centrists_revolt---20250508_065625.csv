There are GOP centrists? I thought we just called them Democrats.,QuantaviousTheWise,2025-05-08T06:59:18,44
"This country is completely fucked if they can't put a budget together and honestly, it doesn't look like they can. X day is coming for when we begin to default on payments at some point this summer and they're saying (if they can pull it altogether) having a budget in the fall. In the meantime, the budget they want to do will destroy healthcare for millions, causing untold numbers of deaths and vast amounts of suffering and ultimately bankruptcy for many. Fuck me",Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-08T07:11:30,12
Republican voters depend on Medicaid just as much as democrats if not more. Goodbye rural America. I would only hope this is the end of the Republican Party.,momob3rry,2025-05-08T08:37:58,12

US defaults on debt at about the same time the economist say the shelves will be empty due to tariffs.  Summer of fun!,Pressure_Chief,2025-05-08T14:21:39,3
"I believe 2024 was the first presidential election where the Republican candidate won a majority of Medicaid enrollees and all the Republicans can do is talk about how ""lazy"" their voters are. They are sitting around on the couch playing video games you know!   The even bigger irony is that Republican senators and congressmen don't meet the 20 hour a week work requirement they want to impose on Medicaid enrollees. They normally only work 16 hours a week.",ChrisF1987,2025-05-08T20:06:06,2

More than half of people on Medicaid do work. If the government actually wanted people off Medicaid they’d look at the fundamental problems going on in our country where many jobs don’t pay enough or offer full time work. Many people still don’t have access to higher education or childcare.,momob3rry,2025-05-08T22:48:46,1
