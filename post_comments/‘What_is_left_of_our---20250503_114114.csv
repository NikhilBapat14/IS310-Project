"The electoral college and gerrymandering already had US democracy on life support, but Citizens United pulled the plug. We live in an oligarchy where your opinion only matters if you can donate hundreds of millions of dollars to politicians.",Tbone2797,2025-05-03T11:53:54,27

"Enjoy simping for a group that thinks a government who traffics Yazdi girls for use as sex slaves and kills gay people on the spot is a-ok. Look at women and LGBT rights in Gaza under Hamas and then over the boarder in Israel  None of these people ever criticize the fact that Hamas is a ass backwards group of fundamentalist nut bags, in fact they praise them and that tells you everything you need to know",felis_scipio,2025-05-04T06:58:37,-2
Hamas has ruled Gaza as a totalitarian theocracy for 20 years. They are the government in Gaza. They brutally crush any dissent.,seen-in-the-skylight,2025-05-03T16:36:35,1

"From the link you posted, that group states that it changed its position quite significantly from before.  Suppose he was a founding member. Their new position is not relevant to him unless he was still involved with the group at that time",ishigoya,2025-05-03T13:38:29,1
"Israel has murdered 50k+ including civilians, aid workers, and reporters while carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza.

I can’t for the life of me figure out what you’re trying to convey here but it reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/d6d3dRibnu),Substantial-Egg-2184,2025-05-03T20:57:19,2
"You apparently don’t know how to read  “Sinwar later became the architect of two of the greatest moments of Palestinian resistance in the past decade: 2018's Great March of Return and last year's Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”  Al-Aqua Flood was the October 7th massacre. They glorify and mourn Hamas leaders, and they praise violence. They say it right there along with a lot of other kind words for a leader of a radical Islamist authoritarian government and you actually think they’re some kind of ally?",felis_scipio,2025-05-03T13:49:11,1
"Israel had made peace with every single Arab neighbor that has chosen peace and stopped trying to eradicate them. There wasn’t a single IDF boot in the ground before October 7th despite years of reckless rocket attacks, there wouldn’t be a single IDF boot in there now if it wasn’t for October 7th.   Hamas intentionally puts civilians in harms way to make Israel look bad, they’ve been doing this for years. They’re a fucking apocalyptic death cult, there’s no end to the number of people they’d sacrifice for their cause.   Problem is the people who really need to go in to clean up and rebuild Gaza is an Arab coalition but they don’t want anything to do with that place either.",felis_scipio,2025-05-03T20:58:42,4
It’s easy read their own words and see that they support Hamas along with a whole bunch of other batshit crazy stuff,felis_scipio,2025-05-03T20:59:49,3
"Yeah, and they also lay out how their position changed:  > Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) detailed its transformation in a series of Substack posts, explaining how it shifted from viewing itself last semester as part of the Vietnam antiwar movement—focused on urging Columbia to divest from ""Israel""—to now openly supporting armed resistance  I couldn't find anything online saying Mahdawi was a member of this group beyond its founding.   He could have been a founding member of an antiwar group and left when it changed direction",ishigoya,2025-05-03T14:00:14,0
Brother you reiterate Israeli propaganda to excuse the murder of women and children. you are in no position to point fingers lmao,Substantial-Egg-2184,2025-05-03T21:11:03,1
You realize a common tactic with radicals is to walk extremist talk back and make themselves sound reasonable hoping suckers like you will buy it.,felis_scipio,2025-05-03T15:14:26,2
You would not be making these excuses for an extremist right-wing or Christian nationalist cause. Hamas is no different. Shame on you.,seen-in-the-skylight,2025-05-03T16:37:23,1
"We had to kill 10%, one tenth that’s a literal decimation, of Germany and Japans pre war populations to bring their regimes down. We bombed and burned countless German and Japanese women and children alive, even more starved to death both during and after the war.  Christ you want to talk about indiscriminate killing, Israel has done nothing like what we did to the Germans and Japanese as we reduced city after city to literal ashes.   It’s awful, war is awful, but the Nazis and imperial Japan were awful and so is Hamas and war is the path Hamas chose on October 7th. They had a lot of fun fucking around as the trucks drove back to cheering crowds parading around the dead and broken bodies of music festival goers, and are now  finding out the hard way that actions have consequences.",felis_scipio,2025-05-03T21:28:16,4
Do you think Mahdawi is doing that? What proof do you have of that?,ishigoya,2025-05-03T15:41:06,1
"I think you're misunderstanding me.   I didn't express an opinion on this group's current or past position, only on whether it's fair to associate Mahdawi, an apparent former member, with their current position",ishigoya,2025-05-03T18:49:47,2

"Has he ever denounced the group? If I went and started a German heritage social club thats end up filled with Nazis  posting manifestos online about cleansing this country, I’d be complicit if I sat back and didn’t say anything.   How often was “from the river to the sea” chanted at these rallies he organized. They hide it behind “Palestine will be free” in English because it rhymes but in Arabic the rhyme is a call for genocide “Palestine will be Arab”   How often have any of these groups called for the removal of Hamas?   Again let’s think about WW2. It’d be like getting everyone worked up about the charred remains of women and children across the ashes of Dresden with calls to end the war but funny enough nothing about actually removing the Nazis from power 🤔",felis_scipio,2025-05-05T10:41:57,-1
"Here’s another number for you 2/3 that’s 66.7% of the European Jewish population was killed during WW2, that’s what a genocide looks like. 2-3% of the Gazans dying isn’t, it’s actually amazing the casualties are so low given the whole strip is a dense urban combat zone.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki  There’s a reason Japanese cities are so damn modern because we literally burnt most of them down during WW2.",felis_scipio,2025-05-04T06:53:33,2
"Mahdawi himself spoke last year about [how he stood up to an incident of antisemitism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grj328-hlhA) at a pro-Palestine event  He is being wholeheartedly defended by Jewish people who know him, [example here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9TSggPPUZTw)  With those kinds of factors in his favor, I'd like to see more concrete evidence of something he has done or said that would suggest he's some secret extremist",ishigoya,2025-05-05T18:10:41,1
"Oh yes some rando on Al Jazeera, a totally unbiased organizing out of Qatar who also happens to harbor and protect Hamas leaders.  You know it’s real hard to go through and find comments this guy has made in the past since he deleted his social media but hes affiliated himself with activist groups that praise Hamas actions on October 7th and has never denounced any of those positions.",felis_scipio,2025-05-07T09:18:32,1
