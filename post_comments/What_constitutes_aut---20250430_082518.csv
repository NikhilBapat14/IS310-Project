"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)  When Ciro Valiente saw the footage of the screaming Tufts University PhD student being whisked away from a Somerville street by masked officials, it stirred frightening memories of his own from more than a decade ago.  He immediately recalled the terror of government agents sweeping him off the street twice in Venezuela, and beating him for hours with the butts of guns.  “The fear comes back to me, for sure. It’s like it’s happening to me again,” he said. “Just for speaking out about something, I can’t believe you can go up to someone walking on a street and arrest him or her.”  Valiente is among some local emigrés from countries that have suffered under autocracies who say Rümeysa Öztürk’s arrest — apparently for co-writing a pro-Palestinian opinion piece in a student newspaper — alongside President Trump’s broader immigration crackdown represents a source of profound unease.  For some who fled authoritarian regimes, the echoes of the old country in the United States are jarring. They have seen this movie before, and it doesn’t end well.  “I unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms, but I believe no one should be targeted, detained, or deported without due process — especially not for their political views” explained Valiente, a journalist who said he was abducted near his home, similar to how Öztürk was taken, after covering antigovernment protests in Caracas.  Trump has used the notion of a connection to terrorism to justify the cancelling visas of foreign students, some of [whom he has called “Hamas sympathizers” and “pro-jihadist” protesters.](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/g-s1-45468/trump-antisemitism-executive-order-protests-deport-hamas) His administration has also hailed the deportations of what [it labeled “ruthless terrorist gang members.”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-delivers-justice-for-terrorists-security-for-americans/)  “It’s very dangerous, because many innocent people are going to be suffering,” said Valiente. “Many are suffering, and even if you have not been arrested yet, we know in our community thousands of people who can’t even go to sleep because of the fear and uncertainty.”  In a statement, the White House batted away the idea that Trump’s actions could be construed as moving toward authoritarianism.  “There is no greater defender of freedom than President Trump, who signed an Executive Order to protect free speech on his first day back in office, ended the weaponization of justice, restored over 400 press passes to the White House complex, and takes media questions daily,” said spokesperson Anna Kelly.  But Valiente, a spokesman for the [Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts](https://vamass.org/inicio), is hardly alone in drawing parallels between strongman regimes and the current political moment in the United States.",bostonglobe,2025-04-30T08:26:19,5
