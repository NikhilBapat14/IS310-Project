"I appreciate Hogg’s perspective on the party and democracy, we need young blood on the left.   Buttt, (and he has every right to have his opinions in this), in a time when the left needs every vote it can get, he will never pull in independent or left leaning voters who support the 2nd amendment.   As a firearm owner who truly believes we need some major gun control improvements, he will push this voting block to the right every time.  I don’t have the answers to gun control but I am extremely confident, the Dems will continue to lose if they don’t stop pushing 2a supporters away from their party.

"The problem for me is that I totally agree with getting rid of the Old Guard, but the young progressive types are often really hard to swallow. Hogg is a perfect example of this. I understand his *personal* feelings about guns, but no, my Jewish self and immigrant wife are not budging a *centimeter* on the Second Amendment, especially right now.  Whether it's guns, Palestine or whatever else, all these guys have some pet issue that they dig their heels on that are just really grating, at best. What I want to see is someone who is aggressively populist on the economics and political reform front but takes middle-of-the-road positions on these hot-button issues where many ""normie"" Americans just can't follow the progressive line.  Bernie Sanders was usually decent on that front, but then, case-in-point, he always calls himself a ""socialist."" While that isn't *necessarily* a huge problem for me (depending on what one means by it), it's just a foolish self-own for the general electorate. He's also a thousand years old, but I digress.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-05-02T09:53:05,30
His current platform is a losing one. I want the geriatrics out of office as much as any other progressive but I will not budge on guns. It’s not just a leftist concern either. More and more liberals are buying guns and getting trained due to Trump’s consolidation of power. I don’t make guns my entire personality like republicans but I am definitely in the cold dead hands camp. Maybe if Dem politicians gave me even a gram of confidence that they can be trusted to fight back… but that ain’t happening. He needs to change his platform to focus less on gun control and more on regaining support of the working class.,OwenMeowson,2025-05-02T12:20:24,10

"By Jason Lemon — Senior Politics Editor, Weekend |  David Hogg, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), told Newsweek he plans to keep fighting for the Democratic Party, even if he's ousted from his position.  ""Obviously I would prefer that I not be removed; however, in the case that I am, I'm still going to fight to build the strongest Democratic Party possible,"" he said in a Thursday interview.  Hogg, 25, who was elected to one of five DNC vice chair positions in February, has sparked backlash in recent weeks, after announcing that his political action committee (PAC), Leaders We Deserve, would invest some $20 million to support primary challengers against incumbent Democrats in safely blue districts.

"I mean, he's right to challenge people. If they think they deserve their position, it's on them to prove it. If people are afraid of primaries, they know they're not doing their job.  Democrats can't become the same as Republicans and need to change. One reason Republicans are so afraid of Trump is they're running in districts where all that matters is they have an R next to their names. No one actually cares who is next to the R. That means Musk can fund a campaign to get anyone in. As individuals, they're useless in Congress. This leads to an incredible hive mentality that prevents individuals from advocating for their constituents   Democrats are trending that way but not there yet. Voters still care about the person. So they need to be good people  fighting for their voters. I agree there's a problem where Democrats are blamed too much for not fixing what Republicans are breaking vs Republicans not being blamed at all for breaking things.

">I don't see the issue here  It's a problem of resources. Infighting, which is what this is, takes resources away from other areas that need them. It takes a race which might be competitive with republicans and makes it an uphill battle at best.  Right now, Democrats are fighting against damn near everything: State laws, federal laws, republicans, MAGA, BlueMAGA, and now themselves.  Democrats don't have the same resources as Republicans do, not even close. Remember, it's not just money, it's access, and powerful allies. There are media agencies out there that will give Republicans shit for free, while either outright denying Democrats access or charging more than the going rate.  I don't disagree with most of what Hogg wants. This isn't the time though. Progressives keep loosing battles that we should be able to win.

The Democratic Party lost a lot of the moderate voters in 2024 due to the Progressive messaging. The far left was trying to push a National Democratic message onto the states. A lot of the state Democrats had a hard time campaigning in their state because not all voters are for the National Democratic message the Progressives are to push.   State democrats have to think about what works in their state and for their constituents. A lot of what works for state democrats in their specific state to help them stay elected is clashing with the Progressive messaging that is being pushed, so it only APPEARS the democrats are not doing anything.

It's reasonable for there to be two different biases, but it's out of hand sometimes.  The big issue I see is that, there's a lot of chatter about MSM and how it's capitulating when it comes to POTUS. Yet, people believe it goes too hard on Dems, and vice versa with the Right believing it's catered to the Left. The capitalist Media is a business, they have margins. Capitalism inherently chases whichever way the pendulum swings. So do the politicians that are motivated by it.   Newsom has platformed inflammatory far-right mouth pieces.  Whitmer has capitulated and is acting as if she hasn't.  Hogg is advocating for removal of geriatrics but targeting middle-aged individuals of underrepresented groups.  So many of these Dems are more than superficial, they're entirely glib. All the smooth talk and brain rot has given way to the same modus that people espouse to be above.   That's why my fight with him is fickle, he has time to learn if that's what he chooses to do. But in the end, he would never represent a marginalized person.

They are selected, propped up through astro-turfed grassroots funded by shadow donors, and serve only one goal, and it's not the people's.

History shows the exact opposite, actually.  In the late 1920s - early 1930s the SPD (German liberal party) tried to form a coalition with the KPD (German leftist/communist party) to stand against the rise of fascism. The KPD rejected it and said they have to fight against the SPD because they were their main enemy (not the fascists). The KPD worked with the Nazis to try to overthrow the SPD parliament in Prussia.  The leader of the KPD had said at once point that Hitler needed to be elected because it would help the KPD have a revolution. Later Hitler was appointed Chancellor and used the KPD party to help split the SPD votes before the KPD party was entirely outlawed and leaders exiled.",anicetos,2025-05-02T11:07:50,10

I think you’re ex-military (?) and I can understand how you would feel especially betrayed because you’ve literally invested your life in our country. I also can imagine you, as ex-military, would want access to guns during a fascist takeover of the country.   I don’t expect reasonable gun control to be implemented during the Trump administration. When we get through Trump’s presidency, I hope gun control can become a conversation again. As I’m typing this, I’m watching my local news and listening to a story about a 16-year-old that accidentally shot and injured a 12-year-old inside a home. This means that someone didn’t properly secure their gun and the 16-year-old was able to access it. Laws, like child access prevention laws, are intended to prevent situations like this. When I say that I support gun control, those are the types of laws that I support. I don’t support indiscriminately confiscating people’s guns, and I’m not sure that David Hogg does either. If he does, you can correct me.  I feel especially defensive of people like David Hogg because he was a child that we, as a country, failed to protect. To help you understand where I’m coming from, I went to college to be a teacher, and during my student teaching in a kindergarten classroom, we had an active shooter drill. Seeing kids that young practice hiding from an intruder was heartbreaking and it shouldn’t be normalized. Our schools are somewhere that our kids should be safe. Reasonable gun control - not making everyone surrender their guns - is one way to keep everyone more safe.  We may not agree about everything, but I do think we’d agree about a lot of stuff.

Except it’s not a fact at all, you just want it to be true. Rifles of any kind are used in only ~30% of mass shootings, and of those, 75% also used a handgun. Feel free to double check me [on those stats](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/).   > Why are you speaking in hypotheticals without listing examples?  Certainly! From [FBI Data](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/05/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-us/):   “In 2023, the most recent year for which the FBI has published data, handguns were involved in 53% of the 13,529 U.S. gun murders and non-negligent manslaughters for which data is available. Rifles – the category that includes guns sometimes referred to as “assault weapons” – were involved in 4% of firearm murders.”  Now, let’s take a look at yearly gun homicide numbers: from that article, we see there were 47k gun related deaths in 2023. In 2024, there were [30.1k](https://www.omnilert.com/blog/2024-gun-violence-stats), gun deaths decreased 9% year-over-year.

Most states prevent you from legally purchasing a firearm if you have a domestic violence conviction or are the subject of a protection order.   Legislating how someone stores a gun in their private domicile does nothing to prevent kids or others who should not have access to your firearms from actually accessing your firearms. It just punishes you after the fact. If you believe that is useful then you believe in deterrents. If you believe in deterrents then it would stand to reason, if I have the same firepower that you do, you're a lot less likely to commit violence on me with your gun, unless you have no choice.   The guns are fucking out there. And unless David Hogg and the entire political establishment are proposing a mass disarmament of the entire US population, including all the right wing folks, then they can get fucked with their gun control disarmament incrementalism.   Ask Ukraine how that promise they got from Russia to respect their sovereignty, if they gave up their nuclear weapons, is working out for them.",standard_staples,2025-05-02T13:30:31,6

"> Labels and categorization is also how humans organize discrimination, justify inequalities, and create divisions.  Political opinions are mutable traits. All humans use categorization and classification. It’s part of higher order thinking.  I can guarantee that you use it in many facets of your life. Including your political opinions. Who you decide is an example of “real courageous leadership” is a subjective classification in and of itself.  All you’re doing is reframing the same classifications with different language.  Abstraction of your views does not materially change them. Nor is it a foreign concept to me.  > You came into my comment with a loaded question based on an unsupported assumption and I addressed your approach and answered your question directly. You not liking my answer is not my responsibility.  The assumption I used that you lean more in the progressive side (notice how I’m not calling you a “progressive”) is supported by your statements of support of Sanders. That isn’t an “unsupported assumption”. That’s a deduction based on your previous statements.  It also wasn’t a loaded question. It’s fair to ask if you believe that something should happen regardless of your political alignment and political leanings. Your answer to me shows that you’re ideologically consistent in your view of challenging incumbents, which is a good thing IMO.  > Yes. Because the point of the primary idea is to challenge incumbents that are not effective at their jobs, and it is unlikely I would be supportive of an uneffective candidate. However, if there were a primary against a candidate I favor, I would still support it because I would expect the person I support to be willing to stand up and fight - to lead - and not to sit back expecting to have their job simply given to them.  Since you believe the situation should apply equally regardless of your view of the politician in question, then I understand it more and believe it more. I personally disagree that the national party should be doing that, but I understand your position and could see it both ways.  > I like the action if it has a justifiable purpose. But it's a really silly question. My personal political goal is to stop the current administration from destroying our country and I will - quite obviously - support whoever I feelcan best accomplish that primary goal.  And that makes sense. I personally believe that the better course of action is to use these resources against Republicans rather than dems.  So I have some follow ups:  Why do you think it should be the national party and not organizations which are not in leadership of the national party?  I think outside organizations would be better oriented towards those goals, and would remove any notion of impartiality. I would like to know your reasoning though.

"Let me spell it out for you to understand.  BEING AGAINST 2A WILL NOT WIN SEATS IN RURAL AMERICA  If you lose elections then you don't have the votes to pass legislation to improve the overall well being of the country. If you can improve the overall well being of the country then gun violence will naturally go down because of the addressing of underlying issues that cause people to act violent. So winning elections with pro 2A people running in more rural (redish areas) will allow for more liberal and progressive legislation to pass. More blue seats, more blue policies can be passed.  The shinning turd of anti 2A policy coming out of the DNC are bans of ""assault weapons"" which is at best a means to make gun manufacturers to make ""AWB compliant"" guns which are almost entirely based on nonsensical cosmetic/ergonomic feature checklists, or at worse a way to try and ban semi automatic rifles.

Letting the GOP dictate our economic and social policy will continue to harm Americans and make this country worse off.  Again to reiterate.
