"From The Hill:   A federal district judge ruled Thursday that the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) does not permit President Trump to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador, extending a block on the law being used against migrants detained in South Texas.   U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a Trump appointee, said the rarely used law can only be invoked when an “organized, armed force” is entering the United States, rejecting the president’s claims that he can use it against alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).  The ruling from Rodriguez offered a historical deep dive into the rarely used statute —  used just three times propr in U.S. history, and all during times of war — while parsing terms central to igniting the power.   Rodriguez determined Trump’s efforts to use the law to deport alleged gang members strayed from the strict war powers, writing that Trump’s invocation “exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful.”  [Judge rules Trump use of Alien Enemies Act for gangs is ‘unlawful’](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5277593-judge-trump-alien-enemies-act-texas/)",Nerd-19958,2025-05-02T00:33:31,5
