"The Justice Department has begun the first criminal prosecutions of migrants who breach a newly expanded military zone at the southern border that is patrolled by U.S. troops, threatening people with additional penalties for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.  At least 28 migrants were charged Monday with crossing into the 170-mile long “National Defense Area,” a 60-foot strip of land that stretches across the bottom of New Mexico and has effectively been turned into part of a U.S. military installation. Prosecutors added the new charge of violating security regulations in U.S. District Court in Las Cruces to the more common misdemeanor of entering the United States illegally.  Both crimes are punishable by a year or less in prison. But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a visit to the border in New Mexico last week that migrants could face more prison time for illegal crossings. Standing on a dusty stretch along the border Friday, he held up signs he said were being posted in English and Spanish warning migrants against entering the military zone.

Oh.  That's why they did that.    Why didn't I see that coming?  They created military positions all around the border so they can treat it like a combat zone.,Searchlights,2025-04-29T13:20:57,3

"I have to wonder how many persons arrested & charged will be from our [Tribal Nations](https://naepc.com/border-tribes/)?  I'm in Arizona & worked with many of our Tribal Nations. IIRC, they had been able to cross the border to attend ceremonies, care for their elders, etc. Here's one of many stories, [Pascua Yaqui Tribe Announce Historic Enhanced Tribal Card](https://www.dhs.gov/archive/news/2010/07/30/department-homeland-security-and-pascua-yaqui-tribe-announce-historic-enhanced) from 2010. The Tohono O'odham Nation has also been in this border fight for years.",mamalu12,2025-04-29T16:06:19,1

Why are people still risking the trek? This is going to get so much worse.,kami246,2025-04-29T14:35:42,0
"IMO because they are either being forced to travel (extortion, cartels, coyotes?) or where they are traveling from is so much worse that they will risk their lives to try to reach a better place. Many don't get any news so they don't know to turn back or again, are willing to risk their lives.",mamalu12,2025-04-29T16:12:23,3
