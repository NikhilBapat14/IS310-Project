"This article is bullshit. It assumes right off the bat that returning occupied territory is unrealistic which it is not. There‚Äôs an easy way to return the territory to Ukraine: defeat Russia. That is and always has been an option, but one the west has been unwilling to entertain.",Branciforte,2025-04-29T08:25:38,21
"Once again Atlantic...  I'm just a dumb assed public high school graduate... Yet even I knew about his previous financial dealings with Russia. His Florida property valued at $23m... that he sold to the Russian Mafia boss for $93m. That Eric Trump in public said ""...we dont need US banks... we get our finances from Russian banks"". We all heard this fucking years ago. Are you guys just playing stupid?",williamgman,2025-04-29T08:35:06,8
"Oh I know this one!  It's because since the 1980's he's been a Russian asset, and ever since Putin's propaganda allowed him to get voted into the presidency, he has done whatever Russia wants.",FreshRest4945,2025-04-29T08:59:54,7

"Trump was raised by his father to believe that the world is made up of winners and losers, and to not be a loser.  https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trump-the-bully-how-childhood-military-school-shaped-the-future-president/  Trump's philosophy about life in general and foreign policy in particular is informed by his positive attitudes toward bullying.    Might makes right.  Trump's idea of a Ukraine peace agreement is Ukraine's capitulation.   Putin is a winner.  Therefore, he deserves to win.  Zelensky is a loser.  Therefore, he should kiss the ring and surrender.  We saw this when Zelensky met with Trump and Vance.  Trump was utterly shocked that Zelensky wouldn't take a beating and thank him for it.    Under the same circumstances, Trump would have surrendered in a heartbeat.  Trump starts yelling at Zelensky as this is slipping away right in front of him.  Why isn't Zelensky taking an offer that he can't refuse?  There are two things that could change Trump's position: If he believes that Ukraine is winning, or if he comes to believe that Putin is not his friend, after all.  Policy makers should manage Trump accordingly.",I405CA,2025-04-29T08:48:39,2

What I don‚Äôt understand Trump himself says he knows how to end this. He would put crippling sanctions on Russia. So what‚Äôs he waiting for?  He‚Äôs mostly full of shit on this but if he thinks sanctions would help then he should apply them. It‚Äôs the one rare example where he is not acting on an idea he believes will work.

"How? Ukraine neither has the manpower nor equipment to decisively defeat Russia. They can keep this defence up for years, sure, but without an injection of both weapons systems and manpower they can't mount the offensives they need.¬†   The path to victory in Ukraine involves the collapse of the Russian economy or the exhaustion for war of its population. Neither of those things seem to be happening, unfortunately.¬†   The Russian population being fed into the grinder are not the sons of those who have the power to force Putin to stop, and the Russian economy has been in shambles for decades, this is no different.   That leaves the only option of the west putting boots on the ground, and I think they should, but no politician anywhere in the world has the balls to risk a potential nuclear exchange.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-04-29T08:38:17,2
"I have no idea how you seem to think that Russia, and or Russia's leadership would give away land. Even when the USSR broke up, Russia kept all of its country. It could happen if there was a scorched earth event in that region, but only then.   I am going to even go one more step forward with this. Putin is not finished taking more land from Ukraine, he is just taking a break. Eventually, all of it will belong to Russia. In my lifetime? I don't know, but it most certainly will all become Russia.",IndependentRegion104,2025-05-01T05:54:06,1

"How? It would be relatively easy if Western countries fully backed them. Ukraine is a small country, and they exposed how weak, pathetic and dysfunctional the Russian military is by being able to do this much damage to them despite the size and budget difference. If the West really wanted to, we could dismantle what's left of the Russian military, assuming we can keep Pete from leaking the plans first.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T08:41:24,4
"We've been hearing about the inevitable success of Russia over Ukraine for three years and counting. Fatalism is for the cowardly and indifferent.   People like you would have absolutely folded in a snap during the Cold War. If you think Russia is a threat to the entire planet, you don't remember the Soviet Union 1.0 ... however you may live to see the Soviet Union 2.0.",Tadpoleonicwars,2025-04-29T08:47:38,2
"That‚Äôs why I referenced ‚Äúthe west‚Äù and not simply Ukraine. If we gave Ukraine the tools and unfettered ability to use them, they could devastate Russia, including the elites in Moscow and St. Petersburg, militarily, financially and personally, and Russia would fold like a cheap suit. Putin is a leader of a criminal state, and if the criminals controlling that state start paying a heavy price for his war, Vlad would quickly find himself deposed/defenestrated.",Branciforte,2025-04-29T09:01:03,1

"Sure, like I said if the weapons systems and the manpower were there, it is winnable.¬†   You would however need to both increase military spending for Ukraine (something that nations are either struggling to do (Europe) or unwilling (USA)) and drastically increase conscription in Ukraine though, something that would cripple Ukraines economy.   Either that, or bring in western soldiers, which would be taken as a declaration of war by Russia leading to a potential nuclear exchange. Not a popular move for any politician looking for reelection.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-04-29T08:45:09,1
"I literally said in my original post that I think the US and Europe should put boots on the ground. Doesn't matter what I think, the reality is no politician is going to do it.   Please actually understand my arguments before going off on some tangent.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-04-29T08:50:46,1
"Yup, but we pussyfooted around giving them strike capabilities and modern equipment during Biden's admin and then Trump undid any progress overnight by taking that aid away. The whole time Russia has been building up more conscripts to throw at the grinder and learning from its logistical mistakes.¬†   Most of Europe is in no position to provide troops or weapon systems as they ramp up their own defence industries, and worse the US admin are now openly pro Russia. The west has made it clear they are not swooping in to save the day.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-04-29T09:08:15,1
"Ukraine can handle occupation of their own territory, they would need strike capabilities and intel. Both of which we were providing them under Biden. If both of those were increased, Russia would have even more problems, but yeah, it's not going to happen as long as Trump has a crush on Putin and hates Zelensky for being friendly to Biden and Harris.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T08:49:56,2
"Wrong, Ukraine has been given the tools to fight back, but we‚Äôve tied their hands on how effectively they can use those tools. If that had changed two years ago, I believe Russia would already have fallen.",Branciforte,2025-04-29T09:03:49,1
"Ah! my bad... I glanced through the replies and misread.   I think they'll have to if Russia secures Ukraine and is able to rearm. May be a decade or decades, but I don't see Eastern and Central Europe avoiding war with Moscow forever unless they become de facto vassals of Russia.   The West, with or without the United States, is going to have to stand up to Russia at some point, even if it means boots on the ground.",Tadpoleonicwars,2025-04-29T09:03:06,2
"Exactly. As I said the defence can go on for years, Russia is incapable of any sustained offensives. Unfortunately the longer Trump denies Ukraine those resources the more damage that is being done.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-04-29T08:54:48,1
