"Roberts has been backing Trump all the way into autocracy, but Roberts didn't seem to understand that autocrats don't really need nor want judges, especially judges that can impede the autocrat's power. Roberts is quickly realizing that his usefulness is coming to an end.",noncongruent,2025-05-08T16:17:40,29

Chief Justice Roberts already sent Trump a message with his presidential immunity ruling!  You can't send Trump a stronger message then that!,kia75,2025-05-08T16:06:24,9

"As Big Chief Roberts, is a sophisticated jurist, the message will be loquacious yet nimble, in Harvardian Latin,  inscribed by a flourished quill on finest parchment and despatched by a trusted Paige to the lead rider of the local express courier service for delivery as soon as practicable, weather, feed, lodgings and farrier services notwithstanding for the eventual consideration of the named recipient, if he so pleases to receive it. (And learn Latin).",juniperfanz,2025-05-08T20:55:10,3

"They thought they were clear in their ruling that if anybody needed clarification on whether Trump was immune to whatever crime he was currently committing, they were supposed to escalate it back to them.  They believed that gave SCOTUS all the power in deciding, and thus be safe from Trump.",RealGianath,2025-05-08T16:25:38,10

"\> They thought they would have all the power in deciding.     Yeah, that's what women thought too; that they had the power to decide when/if to have kids.  The LGBTQ+ community thought they had the power to decide who they were and who they could love. Voters thought they had the power to decide on their leaders, their religion (if any), their education and justice system. That's before those in power decided they wanted to make all the big decisions (and the small ones too) The power in deciding is pretty well the difference between democracy and authoritarianism. It's so fucking crazy that if I said that out loud, too many people would look at me like I'm crazy. Those not paying attention are in for a very rude awakening, I fear.",__dilligaf__,2025-05-08T17:17:44,7
