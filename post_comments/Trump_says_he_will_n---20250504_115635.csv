"Very stupid question - but not surprising.  Of course he won‚Äôt reduce the tariffs. There hasn‚Äôt even been a deal signed yet.

"Why isn‚Äôt trump highlighting that putting tariffs on China , stops people buying a lot of thr fast fashion / cheap tat that falls apart, which is terrible for the environment ?
