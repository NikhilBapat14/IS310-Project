This is the start of the official Trump Recession.   Chaos is the brand.,YallerDawg,2025-04-30T10:02:28,14
"Trade deficit as businesses rush to import ahead of tariffs played a big role but with no government incentive to bring manufacturing back to the US, just the stick of tariffs, we may be in for more of this in the future.",fyoomzz,2025-04-30T08:15:10,9

Shit we are going to get smacked in a couple of weeks with the beginning of a recession and panick buying,Gladius_Claude,2025-04-30T18:21:41,1
I know that some might see this as being overly cautious but IMO we shouldn't really create a narrative until we know in what way the economy will suffer.   Importers (mostly big box stores) importing more in Q1 because they know tariffs are coming isn't really a huge problem by itself. If the economy continues to shrink in Q2 then clearly there is a trend and that is a recession.   If there are empty shelves because importers don't think that Americans will pay the price + tariff cost then that is a different problem. Ironically this will help the US GDP growth on paper as less imports means a higher GDP.,PuffyPanda200,2025-04-30T10:42:11,2

"Overly cautious? How about obtuse? Further, you ignore the hits to American exports. GDP is going down and Q2 numbers will prove that the Trump Recession is here.",frisbeethecat,2025-04-30T11:04:52,1
"> Further, you ignore the hits to American exports.  What if the USD goes down in an actually significant way (right now the dollar index is down 10% ytd but is back to basically 100 so the dollar has gone from exceptional strength to basically normal) and that increases US exports?   What if during some pause or exception or the such companies decide to import US goods that have queued up?   If US imports fall more than exports for Q2 then GDP numbers for Q2 might not look so bad (though people will generally have issues finding xyz cheap Chinese made thing at Walmart).  My point is that there are a bunch of different possible ways that this plays out. In 2022 economists predicted a recession because of rising interest rates, that didn't happen.",PuffyPanda200,2025-04-30T11:35:05,1
