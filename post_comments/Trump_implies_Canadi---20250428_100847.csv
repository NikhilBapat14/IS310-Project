Technically. But in practice everyone knows who's leading the parties and vote accordingly. There's a lot of people who voted in the federal election that don't know who their mps are but they vote based on the federal leader.,JadedLeafs,2025-04-28T12:36:05,0
"Legit. I don‚Äôt think the LPCs and Trump are colluding, but holy hell he‚Äôs gifted them an election on a silver platter.  He shut his mouth for a month or so, allowing opinions to slide back to the middle and now he does this on election day.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T10:21:48,4

">Trump wants liberals   I don‚Äôt think this is the case. Fundamentally, the LPCs and CPCs won‚Äôt offer anything substantially different than each other economically speaking. Carney is a dyed in the wool Blue Grit guy. He could easily have run as a centrist CPC candidate.   They moreso differ in social policy. I also don‚Äôt think Trump is capable of that sort of statecraft. He‚Äôs just an idiot. I think we‚Äôve all spent the past several months trying to tease out a 5D chess strategy with the trade war nonsense, only to end up with the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just making it up as he goes with no goals in mind‚Äù conclusion every time.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T10:24:17,4

Remember when the leader of the Conservative Party in the Senate endorsed Trump for re-election? Remember when the temp leader of the Conservative Party and PPs campaign manager wore MAGA hats? Remember when PP bought coffee and donuts for the anti vax clown convoy and egged them on in the middle of the greatest worldwide health crisis in a century? I used to be a PC member; this party is just MAGA lite.

"There is no level of stupidity that would surprise me. He has emotional intelligence to get people to like him, and that's it.  He doesn't just want succession, he wants Canada to be part of the US without voting rights.

"You can't depend on any foreign power to defend you from the United States, you guys in Canada need to triple the size of your military if you want to deter an attack, because right now the Canadian military is very weak,¬† suffers from a severe lack of equipment and is not an adequate deterrent at all.
