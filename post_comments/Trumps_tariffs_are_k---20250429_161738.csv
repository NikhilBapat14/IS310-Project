Did these small business owners donate $1 million to the Dear Leader's inauguration celebration?  Did they buy $75 million in [Trump family memecoins](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/business/crypto-mogul-trump-coins-civil-fraud-charges/index.html)?  No?  Then why should the Dear Leader give a crap about them?,gnurdette,2025-04-29T16:24:49,6

"It’s getting insane. The shipping delays and crazy tariffs are just making it impossible for small businesses to keep up. I sell custom merchandise online, and the price hikes are really starting to hurt. We're struggling to keep our costs reasonable while still offering competitive prices. It feels like every time we plan ahead, something else changes.",Dependent_Slice_7474,2025-05-01T09:34:24,2
This would be more useful if the receipts were big enough to read and maybe showed what seller they were from.,Animats,2025-04-29T16:21:48,4
"I love the one in the middle who gives us the breaking news that China is not actually going to pay for the tariffs, the consumers are.   Coming up after the break, the sky is blue and water is wet.",Patient_Reach439,2025-05-06T08:07:36,1
I’ve also seen the impacts on small businesses. It’s tough for them to keep up with the added costs.,Atmosphere_Inborn596,2025-04-30T18:09:18,1
"Yeah, I totally get it. My business has been slammed by the tariffs too. We source most of our products from overseas, and these new fees are really cutting into our margins. I’ve been looking for alternatives, but nothing seems to work as well as the traditional wholesale model. Maybe POD could be worth a try, though I’ve heard some people are making it work.",bridetobe171717,2025-05-01T09:36:45,2

We got hit pretty hard when the tariffs kicked in. Our supply costs shot up and margins shrank overnight. Not much room to adjust.      Tried finding new vendors but it’s slow going. It’s tough making long-term plans when policy keeps shifting. Just taking it month by month.,Laugh-Mild411,2025-04-30T18:46:19,1
Have you tried print-on-demand? It helped us stay flexible with less upfront cost.,Careless_Sympathy_93,2025-05-01T00:23:16,1
"Yup, I do. After hearing this a lot, I did my own research and discovered Printful and so far it's working well for me.",Laugh-Mild411,2025-05-03T16:56:22,1
