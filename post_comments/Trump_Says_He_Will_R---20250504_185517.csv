"They closed it 60+ years ago because it was too expensive to run.

"From reporter Jill Colvin:  President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on a California island.  In a message on his Truth Social site Sunday evening, Trump wrote that, ‚ÄúFor too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be.‚Äù  Link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-says-reopen-notorious-alcatraz-prison\_n\_6817f95ae4b0e811371e4202?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-says-reopen-notorious-alcatraz-prison_n_6817f95ae4b0e811371e4202?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-04T18:56:28,3

"We have to remember Trump is literally a reality TV show host. He's treating the country the same way with just wacky, entertaining stuff meant to draw your attention to him. He knows Alcatraz is iconic and everyone knows about it. He probably wants someone to try to escape so he can say he stopped them like some prison breaker thriller movie.",Scarlettail,2025-05-04T19:41:23,1

"TL/DR Stop listening to what he says, just watch what he does, he gets off on the idea that people hang on his every word. In a storm, no one cares that the wind blows, they only care about what the wind blows.  Trump also took wedding vows indicating he would be faithful to all of his wives, even the possibly illegals, I mean an ‚ÄòEinstein Visa‚Äô for a at best mid-model? sounds as legal as Elonski‚Äôs immigration which is not only documented but bragged about.",RudeAlarm,2025-05-04T22:21:33,1
"As with all things Trump, that is just plain stupid. Alcatraz currently generates $60 million in revenue, attracting 1.6 million visitors a year as a tourist attraction. It is much more valuable as a tourist attraction than an actual functional prison. If Trump wants prisons he should build them.  Of course, question is, why does Trump want more prisons?",Landon-Red,2025-05-04T22:34:41,1
