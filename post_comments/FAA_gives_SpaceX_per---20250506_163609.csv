"From the story:  SpaceX fans can expect to see a boom in activity out at Boca Chica after the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday granted the company permission to do as many as 25 launches and 50 landings per year at its Starbase facility.  The agency cited President Donald Trump’s revocation of a Carter-era environmental protection law as the impetus for the new increased launch approval.  With the revocation of Executive Order 11991, signed in May 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter, the FAA ruled that allowing SpaceX to ramp up the number of launches from Starbase will not negatively affect the environment.  With the revocation of Executive Order 11991, signed in May 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter, the FAA ruled that allowing SpaceX to ramp up the number of launches from Starbase will not negatively affect the environment.  “The FAA has determined that modifying SpaceX’s vehicle operator license supporting the increased launch and landing cadence of the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle would not significantly impact the quality of human environment within the meaning of NEPA,” the FAA stated in a [53-page summary of its decision](https://www.faa.gov/media/94336).

They launch out over the gulf and head east. SpaceX explosions are more likely to rain debris on Florida than on Texas.  The real crime here is that NASA is being further defunded while the richest man in the world gets federal permission and taxpayer dollars to ramp up his private space company.,transcriptoin_error,2025-05-06T17:08:53,16
All while blaming conspiracy theories for their own fuck ups.   Musk was pushing a sniper theory heavily as to why their last rocket blew up. Rile up the idiots.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T17:26:04,5
"There will be someone in the tower who heard the air traffic advisories, but no one to communicate falling debris and as-yet unfound rocket boosters in the ""Debris Response Area"".  Perhaps because of the blackouts caused by fruitless consultation from SpaceX incels, only 1 ATC controller will be available per Class C airspace.  SpaceX will continue to self-regulate, and fix the problems they keep causing ""really fast"".

"Slight mistake here. The 'Sniper Incident was back in 2016 with Amos 6. Musk tried to fuel the rocket too quickly and it sploded, but then yes, pushed a sniper theory that someone sabotaged his rocket during launch.  https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-pushed-sniper-theory-with-the-feds-far-more-than-is-publicly-known/",cowboycoco1,2025-05-06T19:15:07,2
