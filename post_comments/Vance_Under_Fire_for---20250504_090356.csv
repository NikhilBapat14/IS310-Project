The Church should take a stand and just excommunicate this fucker.  Send the message this nonsense will not be tolerated.,vwboyaf1,2025-05-04T09:16:21,172
It doesn't matter for this directly but still it's important to keep in mind that the seperation of Church and State isn't just there to protect Atheists or Muslims or Jews. It's there to protect Christians from each other too. To prevent good old fashioned Protestant Vs Catholics violence. The Christian Nationalists behind Trump are Conservative Protestants that don't see Catholics or liberal Christian denominations as valid. That's why they are so weird about the Pope.,NuevoXAL,2025-05-04T09:15:46,101

We thought that America electing Trump was a joke. Now your supreme leader is taking his stand up routine on the road and calling it “The Orange Collar Tour” staring a parade of clowns from the GOP.

There is simply no practical upside to it.    Unless it was designed from the outset to be a personal insult to somebody.   Which leads us to Vance.

Can’t wait for all of the “is this you” posts after Trump inevitably dies and these people all vie for position in the power vacuum left in the orange guys absence.
