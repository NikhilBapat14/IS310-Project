"Really, it's just... incredible to hear that a Secretary of Defense spends so much time on internal investigations, truly, is this really how we should be spending our time and resources when national security is at stake, like, are we really prioritizing petty internal matters over, you know, actual threats? And the fact that Joe Kasper, Hegseth's former chief of staff, reportedly berated officials in meetings, it's just... great, and prone to tangents about strip club visits and bowel movements... just wow, it really speaks volumes about the level of dysfunction happening at the Pentagon leadership.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-28T09:19:41,214

"> “I think it’s kind of consumed the team a little bit… If you look at a pie chart of the secretary’s day, at this point, 50 percent of it is probably leak investigation. Press. It’s that.”  It's truly depressing. This whole situation screams mismanagement and to be honest, a complete lack of focus. The fact that he spends half his day chasing leaks, really, fifty percent, while also posing for pictures with troops... it's just beyond belief. I mean, I'm a mom and I understand things get hectic, but this seems excessive. Plus, the fact that he's posting sixteen photos and videos of himself working out with troops in just one month is kind of pathetic, don't you think? I just find this entire affair extremely troubling, and I hope someone starts looking into it properly.

"It's not just Hegseth though, it's all the people he is investigating for leaks. It sounds like a lot of the Pentagons time is consumed by leak investigations and paranoia. It was interesting to hear Leavitt say the whole Pentagon was against Hegseth, in any normal administration he would be gone by now.",boofles1,2025-04-28T16:26:26,1
"Honestly, if you're in the Pentagon and you love the US you probably want to keep feeding Hegseth leak rumors too. This way the rest of the Defense Department can still operate without him.",mindfu,2025-04-28T14:46:21,6

Every time I hear this guy on TV he sounds like he just ripped a fat line after drinking all day. Even if its in the morning.   At least Stephen Miller sounds like he's *only* on coke. Not that its much better.,Peroovian,2025-04-28T16:27:11,10
"It’s Terry Pratchett’s birthday, so it’s fitting to mention his novel “The Fifth Element.” As a sub plot, a perfectly inadequate sergeant suddenly finds himself in charge of the Discworld’s largest police force. He cracks under the pressure almost immediately and accuses everyone in the building of stealing his sugar cubes. People are punished and fired if he suspects them of sugar cube theft. In response to him also denying their pay, they form a union and go on strike. Turns out, the sergeant just keeps miscounting.  On Roundworld (our world) a perfectly inadequate reserve officer of a not particularly high rank, gets fired from multiple positions and then finds himself in charge of the world’s largest military. He cracks under the pressure almost immediately and begins accusing everyone of leaking information and punishes and fires quite a few people. Turns out, he was the leak all along.",ChimpanzeeRumble,2025-04-28T11:33:18,37
