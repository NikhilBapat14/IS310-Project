">The court also ordered the Border Patrol to document every stop and provide reports within 60 days. During oral arguments on Monday, the government attorney said doing so would be burdensome to Border Patrol agents. Judge Thurston rebuked the government, saying: “They have to make a report for every arrest, not sure what the burden is.” <  Just so we’re aware, they thought it was burdensome to make a report for every arrest.",Worried_Substance141,2025-05-01T04:37:57,166

"> They tried to persuade Thurston that the order would not be necessary because the agency is already taking steps to retrain its officers. In a previous court filing, government attorneys said Border Patrol had issued guidance to retrain the El Center sector’s 900 agents on the Fourth Amendment in order to prevent warrantless arrests.  Imagine having a career where you're doing such a shitty job at work that your entire office is dealing with litigation based on your performance. Imagine that the result isn't that you're fired, but that your boss goes to bat for you in court and assures the judge that they're working on ""retraining"" you.
