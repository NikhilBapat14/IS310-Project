"The answer is kind of. The US lacks the same constitutional provisions as South Korea for martial law, it's simply not in the constitution. Martial law has been particularly enacted in the US before but it has generally tested the limits of the constitution. The closest is the insurrection act which allows the president to use the military to restore order.  In terms of arresting congress, Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the constitution says that senators and representatives ""shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same."" So if the president follows the law he would need to indite members of Congress to arrest them which would be a long process and require a grand jury. Of course if the president does anything illegal the Supreme Court can say that's it's illegal but they can't really enforce that ruling if the president does not cooperate. Basically if the president tries to take power and ignore the constitution we can't rely on the constitution to protect us. The military would have to not follow illegal orders and/or mass protests and/or actions from the governor's.  In terms of other questions Congress probably can't override any martial law deceleration, the process would take to long. Any attempt to do so would be subjected to a veto. The congress can convene outside the capital. And if there's a supermajority in Congress that wants to impeach the president they can do it very fast.

"First this is why we have guns in our country.   But there are other things we have. For one, the military could (and would likely) simply refuse to act.   We have the [posse comitatus act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act), which forbids US military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.  And also guns...   We have Congress' ability to impeach the president   When challenged, the supreme court could strike the order down   We have armed militias, police, and state power over the national guard   And did I mention this is why we have guns?",Laniekea,2024-12-05T21:49:36,-20
“congress can convene outside the capital. And if there's a supermajority in Congress that wants to impeach the president they can do it very fast.”  It was understanding the Section 5 Clause 4 prevented Congress from meeting anywhere but the Capitol without the consent of the other House; this would certainly complicate things. Would a resolution that granted authority to meet outside the Capitol need to be taken in the Captiol in the first place-as such a resolution would need to have legal force; the constitution stating they have to meet in the Capitol would seem like that resolution would be null? ,Thales-of-Mars,2024-12-11T10:23:43,1
"You're not banned.  You were never banned.  Your comment was removed because it was a top-level comment that did not contain a link, so probably not well sourced - we actually have an announcement at the top of our sub explaining this new rule and how the automoderator would be enforcing it.  And given I *can* see that comment, it would fail *multiple* of our rules.  We're not here to score political points or be political hacks.",AuditorTux,2024-12-06T11:44:19,1

4 months old so very sorry. The standing rules of both chambers allow the speaker and majority leader to convene the Congress outside the capitol. So a resolution of both chambers is already approved.,ELOisUnder9000,2025-04-17T15:48:25,1
Well regulated? No. It'd be on the spectrum of chaotic good/neutral/evil. This is America.,pdx2las,2024-12-06T09:07:52,7
Right. With the information the nsa and other agencies have on us (I’m talking about agencies the regular public doesn’t even know exist) and drones a stockpile of guns isn’t going to do anything but make you a prime target.
