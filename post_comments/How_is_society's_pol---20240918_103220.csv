">How is society's political ideology defined?  First define ""political ideology."" What you consider ""political ideology"" is most likely not ""political ideology"" nor ""implemented."" But go ahead let's see; once you try to define it or give an example of what you mean, we can begin to correct it.  >Is a given implemented ideology truly what it says it to be even if it contains contradictions? Or is it disqualified as truly being that said ideology because of those contradictions?   Or do you think the only reason it would be disqualified would be because of something systemic?  In politics and many of the social sciences, there are no rigid systems for validating what concepts are valid or invalid, based on things like logic, consistency, etc.  So ideologies that are adopted are adopted mostly based on popularity.  And for that reason yes, popular ideologies may contain contradictions within itself and with other ideologies.  Contradictions usually don't disqualify a concept or ideology. As I said, it's based on popularity. If contradictions occur, most people would not even open their eyes to those contradictions or accept it if its from a popular author. We simply label the topic with ""it's complicated"" instead of using that as a basis for recognizing the flaw in the concept (which is probably widely adopted) and discarding or questioning it to improve it. If attempts are made to improve the concept, it often happens by ""patch work."" For instance, add another condition to the concept to make it ""whole,"" and keep adding new conditions when new contradictions emerge. Eventually they may break the concept apart to create various ""forms"" of the concept. That's how contradictions are resolved.  A good example is the simple concept of ""democracy."" It has been subjected to that very treatment over the years.  And yeah, most social scientists would come after me for all those remarks.  >Like for example it's not that the Soviet Union wasn't socialist because it sold Pepsi and other capitalist products, but rather it wasn't socialist because the workers didn't own the means of production.  I don't understand what you are trying to say here. But ""socialism"" is not a political ideology (I know, most scholars will tell you it is; it's the result of erroneous literature, due to the problem I have just hinted at above).",fletcher-g,2024-09-18T15:45:20,3
"Every political ideology contains contradictions because ideologies are merely the brains attempt to simplify the world as a survival mechanism. for example, humans like to feel like they are on the good side or the right side and the opponent is on the wrong side. when in reality, humans a just tribal advanced apes competing for resources so neither side is right or wrong they are merely trying to survive. Would we say that one group of apes that is living in the jungle is right and the other group is wrong? It doesn’t make any sense . Is a lion eating a gazelle right or wrong? it simply is. So because the ideology is helpful to the survival of the individual and group, they tend to ignore the obvious contradictions because there’s a greater purpose. The ideology of the west is generally secular liberalism which came about because of abuses from the Catholic Church and of monarchs so the secular liberal ideology evolved as a survival mech aims against those dominating factors, ie we humans don’t want to be oppress by churches or monarchs anymore.. as for socialism , it evolved as a survival mechanism against oppressive “capitalists” and so tribes of humans adopt the ideology as their brain perceives the threat from the rich.",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-18T17:29:07,1
"Ideology is defined as conscious or unconscious beliefs about the way the world works. Ideologies contain assumptions about what groups (or genders) of persons are most worthy of protection, privilege or access to power. They contain assumptions about the authority of institutions like governments, government agencies, schools, banks, businesses, churches, family, entertainment industries and the like. They can be both conscious and unconscious.  We can believe we simply have no ideology and instead favor the solving of social problems, but in our very identification of problems and our working out of solutions we will be guided by assumptions we make based on our upbringings, our educations, our preferences, our antipathies. Some theorists will tell you there is nothing outside of ideology. Even the scientific process has been critiqued as an ideology.  Often ideologies are distinguished from one another by what groups they privilege, how they favor raising and spending money, what kinds of worlds they wish to see in the future. Ideologies can be analysed based on the parameters of the debate that they allow and the in groups allowed to take part in the debate and the out groups whose views are thought too outrageous to be considered.  Theorists about ideology include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Noam Chomsky, Terry Eagleton, Frederic Jameson and many many others.",deltalitprof,2024-09-19T18:47:52,1
"There is a vein of absolutist thinking in this question that just doesn't quite make any sense to me. When we talk about ""defining a political ideology"" who is defining it? It almost seems like you feel the labels that we use to describe a society has some sort of inherent value more than the things we can observe in the society. In other words, you seem to value the label as some sort of predictor, rather than just a description that is applied in retrospect.  Really, I wouldn't even say that having a political ideology is all that important. Sure, during the Cold War that was a whole thing, but for the most part the lesson we've learned from that is that having a worldview where the entire world is put into distinguishing ideological camps is both useless and misguided.  In reality, we can say the Soviet Union wasn't socialist because the things that the socialists were trying to achieve were never actually achieved--in their own words. That's not western ex post facto analysis. Especially in the middle years when the Soviet Union was at its peak, the premiers were constantly wrestling with why their communist utopia wasn't yet achieved. It was the chief domestic challenge that they faced for most of the Cold War.  But that's exactly the point. The fact that they were more wrapped up in the details of how to achieve a certain ideological outcome, rather than focusing on real policy concerns and how to directly address them, is one of the main reasons the Soviet Union was unable to survive as a viable political entity. Understanding political questions through the lens of ideology is a fool's errand.",mormagils,2024-09-23T15:25:48,1

"You just said socialism is not an ideology after saying ideologies are adopted because of popularity. Maybe u should check the socialism,subreddit lol. “In political science, a political ideology is a certain set of ethical ideals, principles, doctrines, myths or symbols of a social movement, institution, class or large group that explains how society should work and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order.”",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-18T17:47:06,2
"Speaking as someone with a degree in political science, I'm not sure thinking about society in terms of political ideology even makes sense. I mean, how do we ""adopt"" a political ideology? Who makes that decision? At what point is an ideology adopted, and can it be unadopted through the process of protest or political dissent? Or is the entire thing just a matter of ""feeling out"" what political ideology best represents a country? The whole discussion this question is creating is a complete and utter mess and modern political scientists just don't address this concept at all.",mormagils,2024-09-23T15:30:19,1

"You'll have to quote me properly, I'm very particular with words. I said:  >But ""socialism"" is not a political ideology  I wouldn't look on the socialism subreddit. Most can't actually handle a proper debate and don't know a fraction of the things they talk about; debates will often devolve into a popularity and feelings contest rather than strict logic and intellectual honesty (they'll heavily downvote whatever does not appeal to them rather than based on what is true/false). I exited many such subreddits my first week on reddit (social democracy or socialism or any of those many coinages I forget their names). I'm also not looking for a definition.  But as I said, read/quote my OP properly again, and if there's something you feel is still wrong you can point it out.",fletcher-g,2024-09-18T18:00:34,3
"I agree. I think though, in addition, that the problem comes from the word ideology itself, which I think should be treated much like [personal] philosophy.  And once you apply the broad terms ""politics"" (which in itself most people and academia itself tend not to have a good definition of) to ""ideology"" or ""philosophy"" it becomes too broad (encompassing too many things) subjectively, for society to ""adopt.""  For instance in my strict definition of politics, political ideology would include things like strategies deemed justified or best in the pursuit of power, it would include questions of ethics, political priorities or preferences etc. These are not some well-defined and fixed set or ""thing"" to simply adopt; besides being a really dynamic and varied area in which society as a whole cannot be roped into subscribing to one person's ideology.  Thats why in my comment I tended to use the word ""concept."" Concepts, those can be more clearly defined, as distinct and independent ""things."" and from concepts we can have specific systems.  With concepts we can adopt a logical approach to defining concepts. It's almost mathematical. It's pretty much the observation of phenomena. And these phenomena exist conceptually, whether they are observed or not, and whether we find the right language to describe them or not. The logic there alone brings it much closer to a science.  But as I have already noted in my comment, the social sciences in general have not yet come to that realisation or point where they approach these things (conceptualisation or theorising) as ""a logical science"" which can be tested for things like consistency etc. (of concepts). So up until now it's all been about popularity and what people ""think"" or accept from authors about concepts (or their ""theories"") -- as proof of validity of those concepts; rather than by a strict set of rules/tests -- and that makes it a very loose field.  And that's also why the political science field itself is shying away more from [political] theory, and into more scientific/quantitative topics; it's running away from the theory side which presently remains is a lose or largely subjective area.",fletcher-g,2024-09-23T15:54:04,2
Socialism is the term used for a socialist ideology. Is there another term used for it ? Political ideology charts or political spectrum charts generally have socialist to the far left. How would socialism not be a political ideology in your view? it is both an economic system and a political ideology.. just like capitalism is a political ideology and also an economic system,sirfrancpaul,2024-09-18T19:20:06,1
"I disagree that politics isn't well defined, but I do agree that political ideology is poorly defined. I think when we look at a more structural view of politics as most academics do now, it's pretty easy to have an agreed-upon set of working definitions. The thing about this approach is that it directly challenges politics understood primarily through ideologies in a similar fashion to the way germ theory challenges miasma theory.   I THINK you're trying to get around to the same basic idea I'm communicating, but I don't really think you're using very good terms for it. I would challenge your idea that political science isn't understood as a ""logical science""--in fact, I'd say that modern political scientists very much do understand their field very much that way. Modern political science is very data-driven and structural, and it is easy to test things for consistency from that approach.   The problem is that political science as a science is a relatively new concept and not directly tied to American history, so most Americans only learn political philosophy as it ties into their 10th grade history class and then don't further their political science education unless they study it intentionally in college. So yes, most popular authors and discussion on politics isn't actually political science in the modern sense of the word at all, and yes, most of it is quite terrible in quality because of that.",mormagils,2024-09-23T21:48:04,1
"* Governance v. Politics v. Economics * Forms of Governance v. Forms of Politics v. Forms of Economics * System of Governance v. System of Politics v. Economic System  Neither of these are the same.  Capitalism, Socialism etc. are forms of economics.  If you read any author that tells you they are a combination of either of the above, they are miseducating you; it doesn't matter who they are.  If you want to interrogate it, you can start first by defining politics, then use that to define political whatever (ideology, system, form). Or also define socialism.  You can start with whichever definition, and then we can see which definitions or combinations of words hold up along the way, if you don't contradict yourself along the way.",fletcher-g,2024-09-18T19:36:43,2
"It isnt that I am ""getting around to the same basic idea but not using the right terms.""  You are actually NOT reading my comment well. And then you are using your own words to form your own ideas in error (and then saying that that is my argument). And THEN answering your own question which you have created.  In my first comment I didn't talk about ideology per se. YOU talked about ideology (besides just really asking the wrong questions) as if that was the focus of my comment. I had started my first comment by cautioning the OP that they might have the wrong idea of what political ideology is. Then I talked about CONCEPTS -- while using it interchangeably it with ""ideology"" because the OP used ""ideology"" and I wanted them to know ""this"" (concepts) is actually what they want to be talking about.  In my second comment, I only found a nice way of saying you got my whole comment wrong (that the focus is not on ideology) by first clarifying the difference. Then the rest of the comment basically repeated my first comment on conceptualisation and theorising, and explained it better for you.  But yet again you are mixing up words, using words where they are not used.  You say:  >I disagree that politics isn't well defined, but I do agree that political ideology is poorly defined. ❌  Even with this you are misrepresenting me, if you pay attention to the context of what I said is not well-defined. I didn't say politics (as a field) is not well-defined, I said people often get the definition of THE WORD wrong. There's a nuance there you are not getting.  I didn't also say ""political ideology is poorly defined."" pay attention to the context. I SAID ONE'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY may be two broad and dynamic (in that sense not well-defined) to be simply ""adopted"" like some singular thing or concept.  Next, you say:  >I would challenge your idea that political science isn't understood as a ""logical science""-- ❌❌❌  I never shared that view. Here's my view:  >But as I have already noted in my comment, the social sciences in general have not yet come to that realisation or point where they approach these things (conceptualisation or theorising) as ""a logical science"" which can be tested for things like consistency etc. (of concepts). ✅✅✅  Next, you say:  >in fact, I'd say that... Modern political science is very data-driven and structural, and it is easy to test things for consistency from that approach. ❌❌❌  Misrepresentation. You are repeating what I said, by suggesting that is not what I said. Here's my view:  >And that's also why the political science field itself is shying away more from [political] theory, and into more scientific/quantitative topics; ✅✅✅  Everything else in between is a misplaced argument based on the wrong ideas or reading.  One problem I have always noticed with Reddit debates or people in general is the reading. Thats why I always tell people, if you're going to debate/question anything I say, use my words, quote me, so if doesnt get messed up in translation.

"Politics in its rudimentary form is simply power struggles between groups. Of course these crude definitions are not how these terms are used regularly but for sake of argument let’s go with it. Political ideology is simply a set of ideals, principles of a group that explains how society should work, namely by using the government to implement them. Socialism is when the workers own the means of production. Of course socialism is also a political ideology of the advocates of that system.

">Politics in its rudimentary form is simply power struggles between groups.  That's not the definition of politics. And yes you said we should just go with it, but as I have said, you need to be strict with your words.  By your definition market competition would be politics. You'll contradict yourself quickly.  **Politics** is the way relationships are formed, managed and/or exploited to achieve goals within/of a community. Politics facilitates access to, and a hold on, governing.  Edit:  This has nothing to do with...  **Socialism:** when the workers own the means of production.  They are dealing with different discussions altogether, they deal with different fundamental problems, and one cannot be a form of the other.  **Forms of Politics** are the various approaches by which we can do the thing stated above.  **Forms of economics** are the various approaches by which we can approach economics. First define economics. Then we see the ways in which we can approach/pursue economics.  As you can see, this field is like abc, 123, once you are strict with your words, everything falls neatly in place.

"Well for one thing, ""a professor of governance"" is a weird phrase. Why not just say poli sci if he teaches poli sci? And if he doesn't teach poli sci, but instead teaches something adjacent to poli sci, then my criticism that he's a little bit out of his depth is all the stronger. It really sounds to me like he's someone who in a softer social science and that is coloring his understanding of political science.  For example, in his very first comment, he goes into discussions about concepts and contradictions which isn't really a very poli scientific way of speaking about this issue. He does push back on OP's understanding of political ideology as amorphous and vague, but then he uses his own vagueness in response. He tries to expand upon the concepts issue in later comments, but there's nothing concrete in his discussion at all. Any good political scientist would talk about structures somewhere in this discussion so that we have something concrete to focus on.  His other conversation that he had with a different user isn't much better. He basically just denies that socialism is a political ideology at all, then condescendingly and annoyingly argues with the guy about his debate form like he did with me, then tries to differentiate between economics, governance, and politics (or at least forms? of those things).  This whole discussion of ""whatever you're talking about isn't REALLY defined as you think it is because it's actually economics"" is a pretty common talking point. It's mostly used by guys who correctly have identified the issues with what we now call political philosophy and are trying to move away from the soapboxing declarations of those treatises. They instead break down political understanding into very tiny and discrete parts and they LOVE to get on folks who don't properly understand that capitalism is a economic system and not a broader political situation, Susan. Where this perspective usually falls apart is that it is intentionally and mistakenly context neutral--there was a period when folks were identifying as capitalists and socialists and these very much were ideologies that described and overall political situation, not just economic beliefs. This perspective is a step in the right direction in that it doesn't answer every question by looking at Montesquieu, Rosseau, Locke, and the rest, but it's a step in the wrong direction in that it completely ignores the context of society and also we have better tools now that can embrace the context of society, understand the usefulness and limitations of political philosophy, AND discuss political matters in a data driven and structural way.

There's no nice way to put it if one will not recognise it, even putting it bluntly you fail to open your mind to the possibility (which I already know will be the case). The nice way is the first way I tried, by giving you the opportunity to read again, better, without saying it.  THAT is your actual problem. I can't read for you, and there's no other way I could have formed those sentences unless I spend pages breaking it down REALLY simply (I've done that before in another thread, all it will cost is time, for the person to realise I was right, and still fail to check themselves next one).  You failing to recognise your problem and attack it from that angle, improve your reading, is why it will never work. It doesn't matter to me, but I will point it out if you misrepresent me or say something false.  >But when I wasn't completely right, you started being a jerk  I gave you the benefit of doubt and ignored your insults in the previous response. I tend to respond with equal energy to whatever comes my way, so I'd be civil if I were you.  You made an error, I was nice the first time, you repeated it (with a false accusation this time, and more misrepresentation), I was forward the second time in my respose, you came in with a tongue in cheek even insulting response the third time, I came in with more. I have relaxed since, and I'd encourage you to recognise your problem and resolve it rather than throwing in words like that in your responses.",fletcher-g,2024-09-25T15:13:00,2
"First of all, this paper is as vague as can be, and while it does outline the basic framework of how to ask a decent research question, that's not really relevant to the discussion we're having. The research question was *already asked by OP* and while I agree it's not a terribly well worded question, the answer given by the user in question is just as vague. The whole point of this paper is not that ""we should use the word concepts a lot when conducting research"" but rather that we should define our terms well and seek to fill knowledge using concrete, expressive language. If we're just talking about how to study social sciences, then sure, we do use concepts to do that. But that's not how the user was using that word.  Second, good poli sci study is actually moving away from this kind of focus on ontology, epistemiology, and so on. We largely have settled on a pretty consistent methodology which is to look at extant political systems and draw conclusions about behavior from that, or to rely on survey data using agreed upon methods. And no one really cares about writing structure. That's what I'm trying to say--to the extent this is not an outdated way of looking at poli sci it's SUPER basic to the point of not really telling us all that much.  > He's instead suggested reducing the discussion down to specific concepts: that is, ""how society adopts specific concepts"" or ""how society handles contradicting concepts.""  Right, but again, we haven't defined concept. We haven't defined what ""accepted by society"" means. That's a *horribly* vague statement. The whole point of politics is that things *aren't* agreed upon by society as a matter of definition. If we're talking about how to examine the threshold of public sentiment surrounding various questions, then that's something we can do, but again, ""how society handles contradicting concepts"" isn't a really effective way of phrasing that.   And when I tried to interpret what the user was saying because his language was so vague and unclear that it could mean a lot of different things, he had the audacity to get angry at me for paraphrasing incorrectly and then he scolded me. That's not a reasonable way to approach this discussion.  > So it's a valid argument.  I don't really agree. The first sentence you quoted tried to define concepts and got as far as ""distinct and independent things."" Why not just call it various stuff and save some characters?  And ""with concepts we can adopt a logical approach to defining concepts"" means absolutely nothing. We can't define a thing with itself, especially not logically. And then he tries to define concepts again as ""observing phenomena"" which again, is just watching stuff. What stuff are we watching? What are we looking for? And then the final sentence says that even if we can't observe the phenomena we're observing, it still exists conceptually.   It's an bunch of sentences of word salad with absolutely no information in them.   > I did not see ""forms of governance, forms of economics, forms of politics,"" in the thread leading up to your comment. It would have to be looked at in its own context.  It was in the thread he had with another person who responded to that comment.   > But ""adopted based on popularity"" I think refers to an argument being made. Whether one agrees with it or not is a different matter. But an argument is not a term. It's a case being made, which one obviously has to defend.  Ok when I explained to you some of the things that bothered me with his arguments, you said you just wanted terms. So I gave you the specific words that left me uncertain. Now you want to split hairs on whether it's a term or an argument. Well he's making bad arguments and using bad terms.  > The rest it seems are common words in political science.  Yes, I said he's using terms incorrectly, not that he's using terms that don't exist.",mormagils,2024-09-26T19:50:04,-1
"You are more condescending, hostile, and pedantic than any professor I ever met in my studies, and the language you use is nothing like what I encountered in my specific field of political science. This is well beyond unproductive. Have a good one.",mormagils,2024-09-25T15:25:09,0
