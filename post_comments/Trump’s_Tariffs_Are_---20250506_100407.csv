Only democrats buy Christmas gifts. MAGA is buying bootstraps and Bibles for their kids.,williamgman,2025-05-06T10:13:06,10
I'm reminded of his deranged and hateful Christmas messages. He's always wishing bad tidings and trauma on America. He's just fulfiling Maga's fondest Christmas wishes--to fuck us all over. That's the Maga way,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-06T10:16:03,13
"*From Bloomberg News reporter Jaewon Kang:*  This year, the best deals on Theragun massagers won’t come at Christmas.  That’s because parent company Therabody is raising prices this month on its popular massagers and other items by as much as 15% in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.  Chief Executive Officer Monty Sharma said he has to go back to customers such as Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. to discuss even more price hikes after Trump slapped additional levies on China. Meanwhile, all the uncertainty has pushed Therabody to shut down some production and delay product launches. The company, like many suppliers, keeps inventory lean and has about eight weeks of goods left, increasing worry it will sell out by the holidays.  Multiply Therabody’s experience by the thousands of US suppliers and retailers across the US, and Americans are headed for a much different Christmas than in years past. Shoppers are primed to see fewer new products and deals, while the retail industry is expected to experience more pain — should tariffs stay in place.  Trump last week said Americans just might have to get used to less.
