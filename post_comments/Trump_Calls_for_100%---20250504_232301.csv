This is very bad and stupid just like everything else He's done.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-04T23:24:10,28
"This is so poorly thought out that it is laughable. Just off the top of my head, consider the following:    Pretty much all films are digital today; it's not even clear that tariffs can be applied to digital information.  Then, is he just talking about runaway productions by Hollywood studios, or all foreign films ""shown"" in the US? Would this ""tariff"" only apply to theatrical films? How about Netflix and other streaming films? Does it include series TV production? Already, most Hollywood films get a higher amount of their box office internationally than in the US; so, in reality, Hollywood would likely lose more from a trade war than they would gain.",Fantastic-Watch8177,2025-05-04T23:35:18,15
"It’s economic and cultural nonsense. Pretending that the tax incentives of other countries are a “threat to national security” is a ridiculous excuse that does not stand scrutiny. Hollywood will not be saved with protectionist barriers; on the contrary, this type of measure will make production more expensive, limit creative freedom and drive away international audiences that value the diversity of scenarios and narratives. It is a low blow to an industry that already faces global challenges, disguised as patriotism. In addition, he ignores how American cinema has prospered precisely because of its ability to collaborate and compete in a global market. It is a short-sighted, populist and destined to fail policy, which will only generate more problems than solutions.",Significant-Bad-655,2025-05-04T23:55:28,12
"I love how Trump is so short sighted.  The only impact these statements are likely to have is a ""boycott"" of American movie content.    Just as Coke and McDonald's are seeing now, these brands are based on American culture, which isn't as admirable as it once was.",Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-04T23:44:27,9
Please explain how you can tariff something that has no physical existence... When you buy a movie you buy a licence to watch or show it. This would be trivial to bypass.,No_Quarter4510,2025-05-05T01:02:57,7

This smells like Stephen Miller and feels like a first step in eventually banning all non-US media. They want to isolate us completely.,Angedelanuit97,2025-05-05T02:22:33,3
"I am a horror fan and almost all of the new, good movies are not coming from the US. Korea and Japan have thriving horror scenes. There indie filmmakers from all over making great movies. Digital streaming has opened the world up to cultural exchange. What if this is a launching pad to censorship of all non-American movies.",kami246,2025-05-05T03:05:34,3
and 200% on movies about ALCATRAZ.,justaheatattack,2025-05-05T00:27:09,2
This smacks of his advisors desperately trying to find something he can tariff to his heart's delight without actually smashing the economy into a thousand pieces. It's like giving a toddler a toy in the hope they'll tucker themself out and give you a night of actual sleep.,yatterer,2025-05-05T00:51:52,2

In an autocracy or dictatorship intercultural exchange must be curbed or stopped.   A 1000% tariff on those shitty US franchise movies would be okay though.,voyagerdoge,2025-05-05T01:31:33,2
"DOA. A tariff is a tax on goods coming from another country. A movie coming into the U.S. from another country is not a ""good."" Rather, it is intellectual property licensed for display.",Then_Journalist_317,2025-05-05T02:43:35,2

so how would this even work and wouldnt this effect about every movie in existence,saiyanscaris,2025-05-05T03:59:09,2
- like the FAIR TRADE deals HE MADE with mexico and canada that he then ripped up a few years later? What country could possibly trust this liar and cheater? Trade is rooted in trust and America is no longer a country that can be trusted,decaturbob,2025-05-05T05:06:07,2

I could care less either way on this issue. There's hardly ever a new movie I want to watch anymore so I don't care where they're made. ,Voaracious,2025-05-05T00:01:17,-4
The move will inflict a lot of financial pain on Hollywood. Many countries will retaliate with similar tariffs. Hollywood is going to lose hundreds of billions of dollars. Ask yourself how long ago did you watch a German or French movie?,Positive_Owl_2024,2025-05-05T00:57:48,7
Is a European movie shown via Netflix in Europe then taxed?  Would an American movie filmed on location in Europe be considered “Made Overseas”?,frogking,2025-05-05T04:10:56,5

"Of course, he's nearly 80 and seems to have dementia. Coupled with the narcissism, it was always going to be this way. Everything is about what benefits him and strokes his ego. He was looking at so many charges before the election, it benefitted him to be elected, he would work with whoever could get him there to stay out of jail, no matter how bad it was for the US and the world. When he was elected I estimated 6 months until the dementia got really bad, I suppose we're half way there.",gizajobicandothat,2025-05-05T02:19:28,4

"Maybe the financial pain is the point. It's known that Trump hates Hollywood and vice-versa. But the companies that control Hollywood own much of the news media, and the media business in general is quite weak right now. This could just be Trump using tariffs as a way to extract favorable coverage or ""donations"" from these companies, an extension of what he's doing with CBS.",Greedy_Switch_6991,2025-05-05T08:25:54,2

"The reason a lot of studios shoot overseas; the landscapes. America has been far ""overshot"" and too recognizable. Also some of the landscapes just don't exist in America. LOTR for example; there's nowhere in the US where those scenes could be replicated except New Zealand.  It's not always about money.

"> America has been far ""overshot"" and too recognizable.   It works the other way around too. Canada gets a lot of production, both movies and TV, because the locales here are so similar to America.
