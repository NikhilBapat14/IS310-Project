Are companies already including a fee to consumers for tariffs they haven’t had to pay  yet?    Seems a little quick.,MeltheCat,2025-04-12T10:33:11,6
Every single business that's been impacted should do this. Make it abundantly clear to those who can't think for themselves that these added costs are his fault.,philafly7475,2025-04-12T10:28:15,7

"Will we will stop shooing at those locations, and yes I realize they can put it in the pricing but my way of protest. Now on the other side it may be perfect for the magats to see it as a reminder of their great leader.",h20poIo,2025-04-12T11:41:31,2
Sounds like a great way to charge even more than the actual tariff is and make even more money! Thanks Trump!,Cryogenics1st,2025-04-12T12:17:49,2

US businesses want customers to understand that prices are being driven up by Trump's import taxes (tariffs). That's both good business for them and good politics for us.

"Actually, call it the Trump Import Tax.   The word **tariff** is just a nice word for **import tax** or (more rarely) export tax. Using ""tariff"" just sprays Trump Cologne on the biggest tax hike since WWII.   The GOP is now the Tax and Grift party. Make that stick.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-12T14:57:37,2
