"I'd like for Dems to remind everyone just why these ""sanctuary"" policies were enacted.  Also wouldn't hurt to remind everyone about the high crime rates of the 80's early 90's where they grew out of.  Turns out you have A LOT higher crime when people are afraid to call the cops, make statements, testify in court or even go to hospitals...etc...etc.",5minArgument,2025-04-28T14:56:08,47

"Our country is moving towards civil war. We have states now in open rebellion of the Federal Government. Those who rallied behind “states rights” are now silent. With fascists you can’t believe what they say against the accused, believe what they say they will do, and they will ignore the rule of law.",IllConstruction3450,2025-04-29T10:09:19,1

That's asking a lot of Dems. They're determined at always presenting the least compelling argument possible through the least effective communications channels.,Boomshtick414,2025-04-28T18:34:55,4

"Last I saw, they were baselessly accusing a lot of those innocent immigrants of being in gangs. I'm just agreeing with the person I responded to. ""Sanctuary cities"" enable people to go to the police and interact with local government without fear that every time they do it could possibly mean their cousin could get deported.",371441423136,2025-04-28T19:04:01,3
