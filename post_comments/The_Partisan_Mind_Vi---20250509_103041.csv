"Ya'know, except the Dems actually did the right thing and let the senile old man step down, and what the result?  We have a sundowning idiot as president.",NolChannel,2025-05-09T10:38:15,19

">The misguided assumption beneath this hyper-partisan fallacy is that refusing to hold one’s own side to account is an advantage. The conservative movement operates largely on a poisonous distrust of any mainstream institution dedicated to upholding standards (journalism, science, academia). Growing swaths of the left, having seen Trump ride to power on a wave of cult-like obedience, have now decided that maintaining any standards for their leaders is a sucker’s game.  The author calls this a misguided assumption and later posits that politicians on the right simply ""take longer"" to receive their inevitable comeuppance.   >Although conservatives may take longer to pay a price for failing to restrain their mad king[...]  That just doesn't mesh with reality. The consequences literally never come, it's not a misguided assumption to understand that.   Whether that sort of strategy is viable on the left is an entirely different discussion, but it's absolutely a valid and extremely successful tactic for the right.",thrawtes,2025-05-09T10:37:39,8
"This guy just wants to shit on people because he can. Calling the Biden debate performance ""barely coherent"" shows his own biases toward hyperbolic statements at the expense of others. As he triples down on his Biden thesis, he waves away critiques of trump as copycatting.  Underneath it all, Chait is just an i-am-really-smart enlightened centrist unwilling to actually form an opinion that isn't simply contrarian mush.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-09T10:46:41,8
"Jonathan Chait is a bad faith actor trying to mobilize a widely agreed upon view to work solely against Democrats. This could equally to apply to a number of right wingers, but Chait, ever the reactionary ""centrist"" withholds his scorn solely for Democrats and those on the left.  He's a hack.",Pike_Gordon,2025-05-09T11:06:01,5

"Amusingly enough, I think the title may have been changed. When it was first brought to my attention the title read, ""The Hypocrisy of Fetterman's Defenders.""  Imagine my shock at the title that was generated instead. For the record, whilst I think I agree with your sentiment, I'm just happy that the titles lined up.",Turuial,2025-05-09T10:45:42,1
"Jonathan Chait isn't as smart as Jonathan Chait thinks he is. He supported Trump Season 1, supported the invasion of Iraq, and talks about Marxism unironically.  He's eventually proven wrong about everything he says.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-09T10:41:22,11
To be fair lots of people supported the Iraq war. Even Joe Biden and John Kerry. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-09T11:16:04,0
"Happily I and the bulk of other people in Portland, Oregon didn't fall for that bullshit.  On the night of the invasion in 2003 the freeway through the center of the city was shut down by protesters.   *Decent* Americans saw right through Cheney's treasonous outing of a CIA officer on foreign deployment, IN wartime because she (Valerie Plame) didn't support their planted yellowcake uranium story on Hussein to justify his oil grab.  The GOP is just doing what they always do commit treason for personal gain - just add it to the list:  Watergate  Iran Contra/Guns for drugs  The brooks broThers riot  The Russian collusion in 2016  The Ukraine call to announce a baseless investigation into Joe Biden  The ""11.000 vawts"" GA call  January 6th  The human trafficking of Abrego Garcia  Open seizure of public assets by private interests, right under our fucking noses.  **The GOP is a RICO!!!!**",SoupSpelunker,2025-05-09T11:35:36,6
