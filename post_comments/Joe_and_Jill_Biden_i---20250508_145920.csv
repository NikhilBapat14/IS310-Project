"History will undoubtedly be kind to Biden but (rightly) critical of how he handled the election/transition period. If there was a proper primary, either a more popular candidate than Harris would have emerged or it would have at least given her more legitimacy as a candidate with a clear mandate from the people. Either way, it would have substantially lowered the probability of Trump winning and the current onslaught of democratic backsliding and fascism.",Temporary-Shine-853,2025-05-08T15:11:38,24

"I disagree with this so much.   Kamala wasn't even popular enough within the Democrat party to make it to the primaries in 2020.   Then during those debates she threw Joe under the bus. Joe thought of her as a family friend a literal family friend and when he asked her why she did that she laughed it off as ""just politics"" then he wins and he chooses her to be his VP for no reason, no benefit. Kamala brought nothing to the campaign that other more qualified people could have brought to the campaign.   She then goes on to be I believe at that time the least popular VP of all time.   Then Biden stalls to drop out.   Once he does drop out they don't hold a primary, they literally run an unelected candidate for president off of the ""well she was elected in 2020"" not a single soul voted for Joe Biden because of Kamala Harris in 2020 and nobody truly believes she would have won a primary if Biden doesn't run for re election.   She was an all time bad candidate, her interviews were awful, she was not good at any part of this. I disagree that she didn't win because she was a woman of color. She didn't win because nobody showed up to vote for her. Democrats didn't want her, undecided's decided not to vote for her, leaving just the GOP.

He had aides and staff telling donors and elected officials that she couldn’t win as pressure was mounting against him.  His nominating of Harris was him lashing out at the party because of the insult to his ego.,Kelor,2025-05-09T07:44:31,1
"> Why would it weaken the incumbent?   Because the other candidates would be challenging the incumbent... Usually you don't challenge them by saying how great a job they're doing. You point out their weaknesses to try to give yourself an advantage.  > The republicans are going to attack them regardless over the same things that the other primary challengers are anyway.   And if you challenge the incumbent, Republicans would also be able to say they don't even have the support of their own party.  > Have a primary and debates regardless if there is an incumbent.  I mean, there *were* primaries. Biden won the primary.

I definitely agree that the campaign itself did a shit job and a super pac would have likely done better with that money. That doesn't make it a lie though.      I really don't think any democrat was going to win regardless of who was chosen. Maybe it would have been different if Biden hadn't run at all but i still have my doubts on that. Frankly if i was a potential pick to replace Biden i know i would have passed.

Yes that's technically true but ignores the alternative is doing nothing and that will cost 40 trillion dollars.    At the very least it is a highly misleading statement. Really the worst form of populism.    You are correct that it was a difficult cycle no matter what. But I think with an outside change type candidate maybe.

Of course. It's a factual statement that m4a costs 30 trillion dollars.    It's misleading to not mention the alternative costs more.    Just as it is misleading to not mention that money would go to super pacs anyway.    Kamala running meant all the money raised wouldn't be spent on super pac ads targeting trump. Why not mention that instead and neglect to mention she could spent it herself on ads?   Why run Kamala when by selecting another candidate the war chest could be spent on super pac ads targeting Trump? ,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-09T16:43:18,1
">Which groups did kamala do better than Bernie and Biden both with in the 2020 primary?  She didn't need to do better, she needed to compliment Biden. Having a youngish female VP with ties to two different minority groups is much better than two very old White guys.   >We know Bernie did better than Biden with many youth voters and Hispanics. Key groups dems lost ground with 4 years later. If you have data showing kamala doing better than either of those men nows the time?  That's a cool story, young voters are the least reliable when it comes to actually getting to the polls, hence why Sanders didn't win the primary. Sanders also did worse with Black voters which is a huge base for the Democrats. Harris also was meant to appeal to women voters who after overturning Roe v Wade the DNC were hoping to come out in support of Harris.  >So bidens argument is sexism cost hrc the election but then he had no idea it was an issue in 2024 until months after he gifted a female the nomination?  No he literally said he thought she was a great candidate but when he saw the narratives attacking her for being a woman and how effective they were he knew she would lose.
