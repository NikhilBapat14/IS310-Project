How much you wanna bet that banning additives from food for school lunches is going to mean no more school lunches?   If you keep people from eating altogether they won‚Äôt consume so many unhealthy toxins. That‚Äôs one way to do it.,downhereforyoursoul,2025-05-05T01:30:12,7
"It‚Äôs mentioned a few times on this article that the MAHA movement is banning soda and candy for people on food stamps.   I get it, it‚Äôs welfare money, but Jesus let a dude have a god damn Coke once in a while. It‚Äôs the American thing to do!   They claim it‚Äôs for the nations health. Sounds like a way to to punish the poor and let the rest keep being unhealthy. Why not add a sugar tax for all like the UK did if fucking soda and candy are that dangerous, at least you‚Äôre not targeting the poor.",zando_calrissian,2025-05-05T08:05:59,3

"It‚Äôs just performative nonsense. The dyes, it‚Äôs something consumers will see and probably be a net positive. The other stuff like reducing the government availability to do inspections and enforce food safety regulations is where the danger comes from.

"Miasma theory.  Diseases come via poisoned mist.  This stopped being the accepted theory at the end of the 1800s, about the same time as handwashing became a medical practice.

Poisoned mist? Who poisons the mist? I guess we'd all be healthy and thriving if it wasn't for the poison mist?  God I hate how absurd this is. Thanks for the info!,atalantafugiens,2025-05-05T05:58:35,4
He *says* he believes in the miasma theory but he actually confuses it with the terrain theory. Can't even get his own crackpot science right. https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-stance-is-rooted-in-a-disbelief-in-germ-theory/,AbcLmn18,2025-05-05T11:37:34,2
