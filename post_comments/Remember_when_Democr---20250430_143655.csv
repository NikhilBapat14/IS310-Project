"Uh, no … I don’t remember that.  Democrats won just four years ago, and did better than expected both 2 years ago and in 2024.    If it weren’t for gerrymandering, Democrats would have the House majority.  ",mysticrhythms,2025-04-30T14:58:20,2
" “While a few agreed with veteran Democratic campaign consultant James Carville’s advice that Democrats should keep their powder dry and wait for Republicans to stumble and give them opportunities to counterattack, most talked about the importance of the party having an agenda and who should speak for the party.”  Well that isn’t exactly what Carvill said. He said that within 30 days of lying down and just taking it, the Republican Party would self distruct. He was wrong. They are still very much kicking",xyz_rick,2025-04-30T15:02:41,2
"Remember?? They still can't. They couldn't even beat that dumb, old, evil, piece of discarded foreskin last November. Remember?? I can't fucking forget unfortunately. They suck ass.",Zealousideal_Ad_9623,2025-04-30T14:55:18,2
"Yes, I remember the 2024 Presidential Election.  Next stupid question, headline?",memcginn,2025-04-30T15:13:24,1
Democrats underperformed their polling in 2024 (lost every swing state at the presidential level despite leading in several) and lost the house popular vote.,Mundane_Rabbit7751,2025-04-30T15:03:52,1
House popular vote isn’t a great metric in the age of gerrymandering and other forms of voter suppression.  North Carolina’s gerrymandering alone would be enough to swing the house to the Democrats.  ,mysticrhythms,2025-04-30T15:15:29,2
But this doesn’t fit the DNC narrative.  They need to blame something outside of themselves instead of doing some self examination thinking they may need to actually change.,Lucky-old-boy,2025-04-30T15:12:53,1
"And then undo the gerrymandering in Illinois it will swing back to Republicans. But you are correct that Republicans gerrymander more. Either way though, Democrats definitely didn't do better than expected in 2024.",Mundane_Rabbit7751,2025-04-30T15:19:30,-3
