Maybe they shouldn't have voted for the guy who LITERALLY SAYS that windmills cause cancer.,bigdunka,2025-04-29T15:37:33,19
"So in a state that honors freedom, his freedom only if you do what you're told. This is typical of conservatives. What about your hypocrites.  In this case, 31% of power used in Texas comes from wind and solar, and they're trying to restrict that.",Watching20,2025-04-29T15:59:24,13
Texas is the absolutely perfect state for green energy.  A shame you have to hit these people in the face with a brick before they realize what's going on.,CockBrother,2025-04-29T16:03:28,5
"Given the overwhelming support for clean energy in Texas, I’m guessing that corporate interests from the non-renewable sector *might* be putting their thumb on the legislative scale here.   > 91 percent of Texans “strongly supported” landowners’ ability to use wind and solar on their own land, or lease it to utilities.  > 75 percent of Republicans — and 90 percent of independents — also favored “government action to accelerate clean energy.”",Rich_Charity_3160,2025-04-29T16:53:10,3

"The biggest thumb belongs to West Texas oil oligarch Tim Dunn. He’s at war with renewable energy. He and another oil oligarch control the state GOP. Dunn’s think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, is a bill mill that cranks out anti-renewable energy legislation and other unpleasantness.  Texas Monthly - The Billionaire Bully Who Wants to Turn Texas Into a Christian Theocracy ([4 min intro video](https://www.texasmonthly.com/video/tim-dunn-profile-behind-scenes-russell-gold/) | [Article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/billionaire-tim-dunn-runs-texas/))  “The state’s most powerful figure, Tim Dunn, isn’t an elected official. But behind the scenes, the West Texas oilman is lavishly financing what he regards as a holy war against public education, **renewable energy**, and non-Christians.”  “Dunn’s influence goes well beyond campaigns and politics. His résumé is lengthy. He is vice chairman of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-wing think tank located a couple of blocks south of the Capitol. TPPF generates policy proposals—from severe property tax cuts to **bills that impede the growth of renewable energy**—that are often taken up by the Texas Legislature and emulated in other red states.”  ProPublica - [A Pair of Billionaire Preachers Built the Most Powerful Political Machine in Texas. That’s Just the Start.](https://www.propublica.org/article/tim-dunn-farris-wilks-texas-christian-nationalism-dominionism-elections-voting)  “They control Republican politics in the state.”  KUT News - [Texas state lawmakers unveil plan to curb renewable energy, subsidize natural gas](https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2023-03-10/texas-state-lawmakers-unveil-plan-to-curb-renewable-energy-subsidize-natural-gas)  “The story of what comes next for the Texas power grid took another twist Thursday as state senators unveiled a package of bills aimed at dramatically reducing renewable energy generation in Texas while pushing public money toward the construction of natural gas power plants.”  NYT - [The Texas Group Waging a National Crusade Against Climate Action](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/climate/texas-public-policy-foundation-climate-change.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) (2022)  “They travel the nation encouraging state lawmakers to punish companies that try to reduce carbon emissions.”  “With influence campaigns, legal action and model legislation, the group is promoting fossil fuels and trying to stall the American economy’s transition toward renewable energy.”  “The [Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)] blamed the Texas blackouts in February 2021 on frozen wind turbines, even though utility officials said the primary cause was the state’s natural gas providers”  “Jeff Clark, chief executive of Advanced Power Alliance: ‘[Texas Public Policy Foundation is] against offshore wind, yet they spent decades advocating for offshore oil drilling. They are against subsidies, but only when it applies to renewables. They’re for looser restrictions on fracking and drilling, but greater restrictions for solar and wind. This organization exists to defend fossil fuels from any threat to their market share.’”  “‘Just as the tobacco industry had front groups and the opioid industry had front groups, this is part of the fossil fuel disinformation playbook,’ said David Michaels, an epidemiologist at the George Washington School of Public Health who has studied corporate influence campaigns. ‘The role of these so called policy organizations is not to provide useful information to the public, but to promote the interests of their sponsors, which are often antithetical to public health.’”  “The Texas Public Policy Foundation continues to campaign against wind power despite the fact that Texas now generates almost a third of its energy from wind power.”  Texas Observer - [Why is Texas’ leading GOP think tank suddenly all-in on an anti-wind crusade?](https://www.texasobserver.org/why-is-texas-leading-gop-think-tank-suddenly-all-in-on-an-anti-wind-crusade/)  “The Texas Public Policy Foundation’s latest PR blitz is the kind of thing you’d expect to see from a seedy advocacy group, not a would-be policy braintrust.”  “So much of what is bad about Texas politics comes from oil and gas fortunes, and much of it is hidden to the public.”",Arrmadillo,2025-04-29T17:10:46,3
