"The person they interviewed is the typical un-thinking MAGA follower.    We can't just suddenly start making things in the US.  We don't have things set up to manufacture things that China does better and cheaper.  We don't have people that are able to work a line even if we did.  Robots aren't there yet, so humans still have to do the jobs.  Even further, immigrants tend to do a lot of shit manual labor jobs like standing on an assembly line or product line and Trump wants to get rid of those people too.    Who's gonna do any of this?  Let's say your average China Garbage Bullshit company wanted to make a new US factory and employ 20,000 people to produce Pure Garbage Widgets, how long would it take to build the physical plant, hire and train people to do it?  Years, right?  We've had 4 months, and none of that has even been for sure time where we knew what was going to happen with enough certainty (and still don't really know!) to spend the gigantic amount of money it would take to re-home business operations.   So, how many companies that typically make cheap garbage are going to fast track a new facility and warehouse in the US and who's gonna work there? The faster you need it, the more it's going to cost so that's a problem too.   This is not about money now, it's not about tariffs, it's just about dismantling the US economy and making some assets cheap enough for Trump's benefactors to scoop up bankrupt US companies for pennies on the dollar, then waiting out the recovery period and making a killing.",MasterDave,2025-05-02T14:14:23,3

"In a roundabout way yes. The importer pays the tariff and adjusts costs accordingly. Which raises the price for the wholesaler and then the retailer. Then the retailer charges a higher price which is then taxed. So you have a “hidden” tax where there tariff is baked into the new price, and then taxes are paid on the new higher price so those taxes are higher too. Some companies are choosing to make the tariff a line item so you can see what portion of the “new price” is due to tariff. ",Decent-Friend7996,2025-05-02T10:46:57,30

Sure from an environmental aspect the tariffs will drive up the costs of goods and reduce consumption as well. Ironically it might do more to r reduce emissions than subsidies for electric cars.      But in all likelihood we will just see companies shift some aspect of their supply chain out of China. Maybe they will ship to Vietnam first and then to the states. Creating more emissions just to avoid the tariff      But in the short term sure empty shelves are technically a great way to reduce emissions,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-02T11:08:18,2

"No, the importer pays the tariff and raises the price to the wholesaler to make up the difference. That is the new wholesale price. That gets marked up to retail however they calculate depending on the industry, and that retail price is the price where sales tax is applied.   The way you’re thinking is the adjustment for the tariffs is an added fee and the tax goes on the original price. We’re all paying the tariffs, but that’s actually just the new price. They can show where it’s adjusted to be clear the increase was from tariffs, but only the importer pays the official tariff, after that, it’s the new price and sales tax is applied to the price.",onomastics88,2025-05-02T10:10:15,22
Which a wholesaler works into their CoGS when setting prices for their customers. It's why tariffs are considered embedded taxes.,Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-02T09:52:34,7
The importer on record pays the tariff and then prices their item however they want (obviously they will raise the price) and then the item is taxed by the retailer. I work for a wholesaler in the US that imports products. Our customers don’t pay tax on our products because tax is collected by the retailer (our customer since we’re a wholesaler). So taxes might be higher but that’s due to the item cost rising so that the wholesaler/retailer can recoup the cost of tariff the wholesaler paid (then obviously the retailer raises prices too). ,Decent-Friend7996,2025-05-02T10:42:51,3

if you don't like the tariffs you need to break it out.  the only way this stops is if everyone from the consumer to the supply chain sees this tariff cost in as noticeable a fashion as possible,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-02T11:02:30,4
"Yeah that’s pretty optional at this point. If the importer has already adjusted the price the wholesaler pays, they can tell them why it’s higher now, show them the original price and the additional percentage that was paid to tariff, so they know they aren’t being cheated per se by the importer. But they don’t have to. Whatever it cost them is passed on and on finally to the consumer. We aren’t paying the tariffs as an additional fee after sales tax, but the retailer can show the work, place the blame, however you want to put it.",onomastics88,2025-05-02T10:57:07,3
Well customers are literally refusing to pay invoices already so we’re just in damage control mode at the moment. Seeing the tariff as a line item would infuriate them beyond belief (unfortunately that fury will be directed at us and not politicians). And yes you could say well just send their invoices to collections and don’t do business with them but when they’re a huge player in your industry you just… cant do that.

if you tell customers the tariff you are telling them your cost   tariff rates are public information so you can back figure the purchase price from the tariff amount   in some instances this may be beneficial to show your customer in others the customer may use that information to force suppliers into a race to the bottom that will put them out of business,hyphnos13,2025-05-02T18:21:10,3

Well when you’re right you’re right! We’re going to have to absorb some tariff costs to keep doing business with our biggest players and our smaller players will just stop buying when their customers can’t afford bigger prices.
