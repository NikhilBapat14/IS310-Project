"It's going to be vastly more expensive than $400 million. That's just to acquire the plane. It then has to be retrofitted to meet Air Force One / Crystal Palace standards, which is to be protected against air attack and usable as a flying seat of government.  Yes the two planes we have are extremely aging. They can't operate longer because their in-air hours are drastically lower than say an airplane that has been in commercial usage for the same amount of time.   The risk is that we won't be able to get replacement parts because they have been retired. I would have hoped they would have acquired and banked as many as they could.   The replacements are already in progress, they just keep getting delayed by Boeing. The current estimate is 2027. And once we receive them, we won't be able to get rid of this one-off.

Trump üí©is a Fucking Narcissistic Bozo ü§°,njman100,2025-05-09T15:15:39,2
"SUMMARY:  **The new jet(Previously owned by Qatari royal family), a converted Qatar Airways Boeing 747-8i, was once billed as a ‚Äúflying palace**‚Äù for global royalty. It boasts a bedroom suite, lounges, boardrooms, marble-clad bathrooms, and a grand staircase.   It's now being retrofitted by U.S. defense contractor L3Harris, under Trump‚Äôs watchful eye, to become his personal command center.  Trump said in the span of a week that this holiday season **kids will ‚Äúhave two dolls instead of 30 dolls‚Äù and ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.**‚Äù  But for Trump, he doesn‚Äôt need one jumbo jet, he needs two.  Meanwhile, the Defense Department just announced an astonishing $5.1 billion in cuts this week.  Trump opted to these **interim presidential aircraft due to the delay by Boeing in delivering the two new Air Force One planes**.  Boeing has been working on the pair of planes since 2017, when Trump, in his first term, had awarded the company a $3.9 billion contract to replace the planes  By securing ‚ÄúGold Force One,‚Äù Trump gets a working, high-standard alternative. At the same time, the move sends a clear message to Boeing and other government contractors: deliver on time, or alternatives will be found. It also reflects Trump's hands-on approach to problems, as he‚Äôs even brought in Elon Musk to pressure Boeing for faster progress.

"Declaration of Broken Contract:The social contract has been broken.We,¬†the People, are no longer being protected by the government as required by the United States Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated.When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority [collapses.In](http://collapses.In) this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle:‚ÄúNo taxation without representation.‚ÄùThis principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution.Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties.Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people.LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments)What Happened:U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel.Examples:VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras.4-year-old cancer patient, U.S. citizen, deported with family.Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order.2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment)What Happened:Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:Equal protection requires non-discriminatory application of law and policy.3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment)What Happened:Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:The Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of personal records without consent or proper authorization.4. Violation of ‚ÄúNo Taxation Without Representation‚Äù (Founding Principle; First Amendment Petition Clause)What Happened:Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties (representation, due process, protection).Why It‚Äôs a Violation:Taxation becomes exploitative when representation and protection under law are denied.5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment)What Happened:Citizens who speak out or file complaints about these abuses face delays, dismissal, or retaliation blocking their constitutional right to seek redress.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:The First Amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.We are quite literally living in tyranny",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T13:57:13,7

"this article is just all over the place. its like an angry rant that fails to finish its points.  the cnn linked article that supposedly supports this oped / rant doesnt show a commitment to buying a non converted aircraft. current reporting shows boeing basically saying they can turn it around quicker if requirements are relaxed.  these aircraft were never going to be cheap. whatever dumb shit they put inside for trim will be a tiny fraction of the cost of converting the two aircraft into what they ultimately are - nuclear command and control aircraft with leather seats. and only building 2 of them makes the cost per aircraft insanely high.  the real worry, and if boeing is talking about cutting back on features the real story, is that the new air force one 747s might be inferior in capability when compared to the current airframes. thats a huge problem, especially in a world of rapidly advancing anti air technology.   but these aircraft were always going to be horrendously expensive. the interior finishings will be the cheapest parts of them. what makes it expensive is better flight performance, anti missile capabilities, extended coms and antenna deployment capabilities etc.",Iyellkhan,2025-05-09T14:44:55,1

I disagree with this premise because I expect that trump never leaves office.  However, if trump is just in it for the grift (and not to stay out of prision), then if he started a GoFundMe where for $400m (price of the Qatari luxury jet) he would resign office today then I think America would fund that in a day, both from wealthy businesspeople who are losing billions from his trade wars and from ordinary folks who are getting hit by job losses and higher prices.",VanceKelley,2025-05-09T16:57:13,1

"The high costs are not the frippery.  It's the special midiar refuelling mods, comms equipment, ECM and survivability equipment custom made for AF1.    Any replacement of AF1 would cost this much.

"He is literally the 7 deadly sins made flesh. Really stop and say them and ya, he is all those things. He is a bizarre weapon crafted by our frustrated enemies to get their revenge for all the defeats we have heaped upon them. And I think he's their Hail Mary pass that even they are stunned by how well it's worked. They did this not because it seemed likely but because they already tried everything else, why not  see if we can inflict some dammage using the worst person in the world? I mean why not? It's cheap.  So now here's my prediction. trump ruins everything and everyone he touches and before it's over in some way no one can predict he will be their undoing too, because he is a curse that no one escapes in the end. Because face eating leopards eat faces, it's what they do, it's all they do and they absolutely will not stop till all the faces are eaten.",DukeOfGeek,2025-05-09T20:43:54,10
