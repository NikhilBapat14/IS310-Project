"""Unless, pre-arrest, the arresting agent has probable cause to believe that the noncitizen being arrested is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained""   They came here illegally does she think they are going to kindly wait while ICE gets a warrant?     Another unelected judge who thinks they get to set immigration policy, a power specifically given to the executive.  Can Roberts get off his ass already and do something?",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-30T13:30:23,58

"Not exactly.  The power over immigration policy is primarily held by the Legislative Branch, specifically Congress. While the executive branch also plays a significant role in administering immigration laws, Congress has the power to create and amend those laws.  The executive branch, through agencies like U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is responsible for implementing and enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress. This includes processing visa applications, adjudicating asylum cases, and enforcing border control.  As for Roberts and the rest of the judicial branch, including federal courts, reviews immigration cases and interprets immigration laws. They also address legal challenges to immigration policies and regulations, ensuring they are constitutional and fairly applied. ",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-30T13:36:59,28
"Why was our immigration policy so different between the last two administrations?  Without any new law being passed by Congress?    They make the law they don't set how the policy is enforced or to what extent is enforced as we saw with the last administration.   The President also has the authority to issue executive orders related to immigration, and conduct foreign relations that impact immigration. ",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-30T13:50:43,19
"It was.  Obama deported 312k people in his time in office, using all the same laws and processes that Trump is.  It wasn't illegal then it isn't illegal now.     It just wasn't politically advantageous to report on it then and it is now since all the MSM is being paid by the left.",MaglithOran,2025-04-30T22:58:18,7
"Obviously Biden chose not to enforce immigration laws, Trump did and went a step further and is using EO's to ramp it up.  Ultimately congress will have to sharpen immigration laws since EO's aren't enduring.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-30T14:00:16,11
