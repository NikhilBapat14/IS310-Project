It also doesn't define what due process is. Not all due process is the same for all events. if you can link me a government defined definition of due process for all types of events I will go with it but that doesn't exist or at least I have never seen it written in government acts or constitution.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T17:15:45,1
So true It is funny when you look at impeachment data for the government no US president has ever been successfully convicted in an impeachment. The only people to ever been fully removed from office due to impeachment were 8 federal judges. So that tells you that the most corrupt part of the US government is judges and should be the least trusted of all officials.

You're not arguing in good faith but just in case someone else reads this.  Due Process is the application of all applicable legal rules and procedures to any particular case. That definition holds true for all events.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-04T17:21:11,2

Hey bro real quick question.  How many federal judges have there been in US history and how many presidents have there been?,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-04T14:35:29,6
Thankfully Reddit keeps our posting history. Nothing to read here.,williamgman,2025-05-04T17:13:29,2
Except you are 100% wrong. A simple exception to this is due process where a person is allowed bail vs not allowed bail. How is due process always the same if one person is allowed bail for some cases but others with the same charge are not allowed bail? It is up to the opinion of the judge to grant or not grant bail. Why is it that the same crime could end with 1 years in jail but other times it is 10 years in jail? There is still a level of opinions in due process and it isn't always exactly the same. It isn't always 1 + 1 = 2.  **EDIT:** Also due process only exist to reduce the chances of a mistake in the outcome of a case. So even if due process is not followed as long as there is no problem with the outcome you can consider it a mistake but you shouldn't let a murder out of jail because they made a mistake in due process. If in on the other hand there was a mistake in due process that could lead to a different outcome in the verdict such as evidence that the murder did not commit the crime then it should go back to a new trial.  That said if you can prove that the woman deported was a legal US citizen and should not have been deported because she was not here illegally then sure pay to bring her back and go through a new trial. The problem is she was here illegally and she got deported so nothing wrong happened in the outcome even if due process was not followed. I am open to listening to your argument on why she was here legally and should not be deported because she had a green card or something else.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T17:39:39,-3
Not sure if that makes any difference considering presidents are up to this point 0% removed and judges will be at least 0.0001% removed. I never stated what percent higher just that it was higher based on real numbers.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T17:17:50,-2
"If you delete a post the history is still there that a post was made but you can't read what they posted. So only a partial history will exist unless you are an employee for reddit at which point you could maybe read every single change that was ever made and who did it (at least that is how it worked for the background screening software I built). However, that history may not be available for the average person to look at.",Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T17:18:57,-1
Who said due process is always the same?  You seem very confused.  Literally nothing you said here is in line with how the law works.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-04T18:24:37,5
You have no clue how law works in reality.  I spent 20 years working in law so I know what I have seen and you have no clue how it really works. You seem to be one of the many people who only understand law cases that the news has reported on. Those are not normal cases and 99% of them work differently when the media is not on them.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T18:29:13,-2

Background screening industry so we deal with law a lot more than you would think. We pull records for court cases and determine if we can legally report them to clients etc. So when dealing with that we see what really happened in all these small cases you never see.  Over the 20 years my background screening software has run it has brought in around 500 million in revenue so I have seen a lot of court case records.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T19:32:27,-1
"Well I spent 20 year correctly interpreting criminal events. including telling my boss I will not code what you tell me to code because I think it is wrong including 3 weeks of debates only to finally being told I was correct in not coding to remove records based on bad data I was told to do because It would have ended up with murder convictions being removed from the report that should not have been removed.  **DETAILS:** So i was told when I see records that are merged with certain key words I should remove those charges from the reporting because they were merged into another charge. I pushed back because I was like they were charged with speeding, drug charges etc, and if I merged all these records in the primary charge it would remove showing charges of murder, drug possession, etc into a charge of just speeding that would be reported to the client. Now based on the keyword I was told to use for ignoring all other charges I didn't think it was correct. When it was pushed back to our lawyers in charge of what to report they said I was correct and not my manger and others who were in charge od deciding what should be reported. After 3 months of debating with my manager they finally push it to the lawyers of my company who were in charge of deciding what we should report and they said I was correct not my managers etc.  I ultimately probably saved my company millions in what could have ended up with lawsuits suing us for reporting data wrongly.",Viper_Scale,2025-05-05T12:47:23,1
Like I said I am open to be wrong but please provide links to a .gov website or other raw documents from the government that states otherwise. If you link to a bias news website it doesn't really mean what they are posting is true. You know it happens multiple times per year where a news organization post some crazy story they claim to be true then months later the truth comes out and they may post a small article stating they were wrong but it never gets seen by 75% or more of the people so they still believe the original article that wasn't true.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T19:01:26,0
Holy shit that’s an even worse response  I can’t believe I got you to admit you don’t know shit about the law😂,3slimesinatrenchcoat,2025-05-04T19:35:30,5
"I work primarily in IT as a software engineer so along with my phd in computer science I also have a minor in religion, a bachelor's in philosophy, and a bachelor's in criminal justice. See your problem is just making assumptions when people state things.  I am guilty of baiting you into that one. I work closely with lawyers for my company and have a very good understanding of law considering criminal checks are a very big part of the background screening industry.  Just in case you are wondering I started college at 16.",Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T19:44:22,0
You don’t though.  You just admitted *none of your degrees are in law*  You’re not even a *paralegal student* pretending  Does the barista at the cafe in big firms offices work “work in law for 20 years?”  No  You’re cosplaying in an area you don’t understand out of pure narcissism,3slimesinatrenchcoat,2025-05-04T19:56:27,2

So you don't think criminal justice degree has anything to do with courts or law?  Working in law can mean a lot of things. The background screening industry gets sued all the time so I work closely with lawyers for our company when we get sued to validate the data we did background checks on and if we broke in law in what we reported to the customer.  There is a lot more to law work then just lawyers and judges.,Viper_Scale,2025-05-04T20:05:42,0
