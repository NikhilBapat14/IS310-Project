"You're halfway there. The other part is what I refer to as the laugh track effect.  Laugh tracks were introduced because when recording comedies, radio producers wanted people to believe all the jokes were funny. Laughter is contagious, after all. If you hear one person laughing, you're more inclined to laugh as well.  If you release a poll that says ""48% of your neighbors think funding the fire department is a bad idea"", you won't immediately dismiss them as pyromaniac cranks, the way you would if the poll read 2%. Suddenly, there's public discourse about whether we should even fund the fire department. A biased poll gives an illusion of popularity.  More modern examples of this same phenomenon are things like the ""political compass test"", which posits bare libertarian concepts without any context and then says ""see, everyone is secretly a libertarian!"". Another example was the ""teach the controversy"" approach to  introducing creationism in schools. They'd get lists of scientists who sign off on ""intelligent design"" to insinuate there was a near 50/50 argument for or against the acceptance of evolution, despite there being no actual dispute in scientific circles.",scubafork,2024-10-28T13:24:57,6
"Your premise is 100% correct and it is a valid strategy. When media makes it look like one candidate is surely to win and you hear that over and over and over and over again, you are less likely to go vote. Proven tactic since 100 years.",Neon-Prime,2024-10-28T09:11:00,3

"More so that if a poll is released showing an opponent up a point, more resources will pour in to the candidate who is down - ensuring more money in donations for ad buys, rallies & events, etc. these polls are encouraging voters to get out there and vote - if their party is losing, they will want to do something to change this.",Academic_Scale_5971,2024-10-28T16:20:49,2

"It is unavoidable to release biased polls.  The people who answer polls are not representative of the country, and that is a well known phenomenon. This is due to polls attempting to be representative, but actually being too small. There is a weird belief in America that all city dwellers vote blue, all country folk vote red, all minorities vote blue, all rich people vote red, etc. etc. The truth is there is a huge diversity of thought and opinion within each ""group"" in America that pollsters attempt to target, so if there are 30 black respondents they assume that's how all 20 million black people think. They adjust the polling based on certain things like race and education levels, and when a country is split nearly down the center this results in a pretty large bias in one or the other direction. It's not an accurate science and people constantly change - they are trying to do things differently this time, but traditionally there has been a pretty heavy (larger than the margin of error of some polls) bias towards democrats for presidential election polling.   I personally don't think polling has any effect on voters - people who want to vote are going to vote if they can, I've never met someone who said they didn't vote because X had it in the bag based on polling. The only people I've heard not vote express the reasoning as I'm in a blue or red state so my vote doesn't actually matter.   Another thing to augment your understanding of polls is to look at the rhetoric being used - if a campaign is using softer rhetoric there is very likely private polling that differs from public polling, and because campaigns have bazillions more dollars than pollsters I would tend to lean towards that as being slightly more accurate.  Who knows though really, politically we are more divided than ever, and that alone is going to have a noticeable impact on polling.

Why not? Just because YOU don't understand it doesn't mean there's a negative impact. Some of the swing states could come down to hundreds of votes. It all adds up.,RedneckLiberace,2024-10-29T13:36:20,1
"Two part question requires a two part answer. Political science isn't the study of political systems, that's political philosophy. Political science is the study of how to get your guy elected. Operatives study what een done in the past and the results of those actions. They then copy the successful actions. Some may seem counterintuitive, but they work. You can argue from common sense that they shouldn't, but that's why there are professional operatives, they know what to do in various scenarios. So yes, leaking those poll numbers excites the base to increase turnout, which is the real name of the game. Part two, all polls are biased. If you could get everyone in the state to answer their phone and give an honest answer, then you'd have an accurate poll. But pollsters fight for 1 out of 200 to pick up and 10% will lie. So pollsters have to massage and adjust the numbers to reflect what they "" really mean"". This always introduces human bias. The only accurate poll is taken on election day.",Outrageous-Intern278,2024-10-29T13:40:17,1
So this my point/ question.  A close poll seems just as likely to inspire the underdog as the front runner.,nevernotmad,2024-10-28T17:02:51,1
