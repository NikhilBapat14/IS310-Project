"[Here’s a link to the order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf)  Edit:  >For all the rhetoric of the dissents, today’s order and *per curiam* confirm that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement.  We’re going to see a fuckton more people arrested and *quickly* moved to venues favorable to the administration.   This is fucking terrifying.",SchoolIguana,2025-04-07T18:41:32,1
"the governments argument that ""they should absolutely"" receive judicial review is such UTTER FUCKING HORSESHIT when they already sent multiple planeloads out of the fucking country, they've already demonstrated with the Maryland mans case that they are incapable of doing this without administrative mistakes, let alone actual process mistakes, and that they are apparently either incapable or UNWILLING to get them back when they fuck the pooch.  let the administration lock them up if you really don't wanna block the AEA yet, but goddammit, leave the ban on shipping them to a random country they aren't even from until their cases have been heard. are our prisons really so full of holes that these people would escape from them? are our wardens incapable of keeping them from killing other prisoners (because I know that's your next argument)? if so, then our entire prison system is a joke (well, it already is, but for other reasons).  FUCK THIS ADMINISTRATION. goddamn.",Red49er,2025-04-07T19:07:34,1

"Then we gonna see what the different states and cities would do. NYC would be cooperating with ICE for sure, but then would other blue states or cities follow would be a problem. And if they starting to show more ruthless raid to some neighborhood, we gonna see some local resistance toward ICE. And that can get scary. And if we are seeing local stand off between the local residents, federal officers, state and local authorities; then we are shifting quickly back to the 60s and civil war is no longer just a fearmonering.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T18:46:23,1
