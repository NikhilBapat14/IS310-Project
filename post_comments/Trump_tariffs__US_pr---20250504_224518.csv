You know other counties are going to retaliate right? Film industry gonna die even faster,StrictNewspaper6674,2025-05-04T22:48:23,27
"You can't make a movie in America anymore and you don't have to, so why would you? Anything you need to buy costs 150% more than it did 2 months ago, costs are about to skyrocket for film production in the US; fabric, paint, lights.. all that costs more now. So why not just shoot in Canada for the tax credit here and get those Yankee Doodle Dummies to pay the 100% extra for their stream, or ticket and make it their problem.. there is an entire world out there, fuck the American markets and theaters.  What this is going to boil down to is Americans are going to be paying more for films and entertainment, it's not going to affect the rest of the world at all.  The US film industry is on life support.. this probably just pulled the plug.",AllDayTripperX,2025-05-04T23:17:45,20

"It’s really cool how we basically put a thing in federal law that says, “if the President says the magic words, then he can basically flout all sorts of federal statutes.”  And apparently nobody before Trump was willing and/or insane enough to take it to its absolute extreme.",ScotTheDuck,2025-05-04T23:33:21,14
Tariffs=Extortion TO American companies.   He wants money and power from every productive sector in the US.  This is not about other countries. This is about him getting to be in power for life so elections are not even needed. ,Cleanbriefs,2025-05-04T23:04:52,9
How is this tariff supposed to work? What is exactly imported here where the tariff applies and is calculated on? Whole production cost?,WingedGundark,2025-05-04T23:38:16,7
The whole of The Lord of the Rings was flimed in New Zealand. Is that tariffed now?   Is it just movies made by studios based in other countries? MAGA doesn't want people learning the USA is not the only country in the world? But what if they film in the USA? Are they still tariffed.   MAGA hates Hollywood because they think it's 'too woke' this is just some petty revenge that doesn't even make sense.,Araloosa,2025-05-05T00:21:08,6
">US President Donald Trump says he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.  >Trump said he was authorising the US Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying ""a very fast death"".  >He blamed a ""concerted effort"" by other countries that offer incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, which he described as a ""National Security threat"".",8to24,2025-05-04T22:46:09,4

"I want to warn that this is how Communism starts and isolation.  They will impose tariffs on production of foreign films toward US markets but this will create two situations:  1.   American companies will be forced to make films here and the new Hays Code will get applied.   2. Foreign Films will become harder to watch here, which means your information bubble will be limited similar to that or North Koreans.     And the final change will be that Trump's government will eventually create a system of ""tell on your neighbor"" similar to former USSR countries, Cuba, and North Korea. The future is a totalitarian state. This is what they want.",origamipapier1,2025-05-05T08:37:17,0

"It’s pretty easy to do tbh. Totally legal and totally cool. Say you don’t like foreign films?   🚨🚨🚨NATIONAL EMERGENCY!!!🚨🚨🚨  The film industry is under attack by a concerted organized effort by other nations to release films in the US! There could be propaganda in those films, and they’re also trying to ***destroy Hollywood***!  Bam, done. You now have the authority to unilaterally tax films not made stateside.   We’re told that tariffs are levied to bring back jobs and increase domestic production. Given that Hollywood has perpetually and perennially dominated the world’s film industry for all of living memory, that’s clearly a lie.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-05-05T04:02:23,3
It worked so well at rewarding billionaires after 07-08 that they needed a candidate who would make them a lot of money and grabs again!,postsshortcomments,2025-05-04T23:31:22,3
"I’m assuming theaters would have to pay the 100% tax on the physical reels they purchase from overseas. Tariffs don’t factor in production costs at all. However, almost no movie theaters use physical film on reels these days. It’s all digital, and you cannot tariff digital goods.   I don’t think they’ve thought this through. Not unlike this Alcatraz shit, it’s just steam of consciousness bullshit as usual. He’s a king after all. If it sounds good in the moment to him, the. It’s the right move. No thought, much less research, required.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-05-05T04:10:42,6

Yeah agreed but that's always further than they are willing to think. Americas economy is crashing and California was ranked 4th highest gdp in the world or something.
