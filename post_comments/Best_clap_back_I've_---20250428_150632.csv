"We don‚Äôt need Obama, we need the next ‚ÄúObama,‚Äù a candidate that reinvigorates the party and gets everyone to rally behind one single cause.

"No. Just no.  Sometimes, I think some of this ""Obama 2028"" crap is being pushed by Trump trolls.   I love Obama, but it's probably the VERY WORST TIME in history to push for constitutional amendments that extend the power of the executive.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-28T15:21:28,251

"You Russian trolls can keep pushing this bullshit but the fact is Obama is an actual patriot and would turn this shit down immediately.   This is just trying to get people comfortable with the idea of throwing out the constitution if it benefits them.   Absolutely not.

As funny as I think an Obama vs Trump 3rd term rematch would be hilarious and Obama. Would pwn Trump do hard. Fuck that   2 terms and you are gone,NJThrowaway1012,2025-04-28T15:20:26,25
"How about we dont put Obamas face on merch that he does not endorse that puts forth an idea that violates the constitution? Trump is a POS for even suggesting that he would go for a third term and an even bigger POS that he is now advertising it. Let's not go tit for tat and try to make two wrongs into a right.   To be clear, I'd love another Obama term. And if Trump did somehow loophole that, hell yeah get him back in the race. Until then, sure, we can make the Obama 2028 hats but let's not pretend like Obama has anything to do with it.",Simp4M0105,2025-04-28T16:38:35,5
"I don't think Obama will even entertain that possibility, being a legal scholar himself.

"I loved Obama, he was cool.  he was young, active, and seemed like he had a handle on things for the most part.  but this gets us nowhere.  the Democratic party needs new young leaders to carry the torch.  I don't mean someone who just turned 35 but maybe someone who's in their late 40s early 50s.  Obama is great but we need the next group to stand up",Raglesnarf,2025-04-28T19:34:03,3
