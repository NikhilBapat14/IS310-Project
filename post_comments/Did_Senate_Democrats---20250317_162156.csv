"From what I understand…there was no real guarantee as to when, how, or to what extent the government would ever reopen.   The Republicans could somehow just agree to….they could claim sone agencies had to remain open, like Air Traffic Controllers and military…but anything else….just leave it closed for as long as Trump is in office.

I think they are banking on the fact that letting the Trump administration carry out is agenda will tank republican chances in the midterms and so they want to avoid getting blamed for shutting down the government. Time will tell if it is a wise choice,DrKaasBaas,2025-03-17T16:27:11,104
They're kind of stuck with two bad options imo.   Personally I think there was a legitimate concern that the economy would collapse during a shutdown and Trump would wiggle out of responsibility.  Right now this is Trump's circus and I don't think the Dems are completely wrong to just decide to sit out till the tent collapses.,Inevitable-Ad-9570,2025-03-17T16:44:23,119
"The argument against a shutdown was that it’d play into Republican, Doge, hands.  What saves government spending more than shutting down the entire government?  If we think things are haphazardly getting lopped off now, imagine starting from government shutdown and negotiating back which pieces get turned back on.",wraithius,2025-03-17T16:36:23,52
"I think Schumer and Fetterman should’ve explained it better but they really had no choice.   I hate the CR and think it’s an abomination. But those arguing that Democrats should have forced a government shutdown to “hold Trump accountable,” are missing the terrifying reality of what would have actually happened.   First and foremost the Courts would’ve shut down within a couple of weeks when they ran out of money. So keep that in mind as we consider the rest.   Trump isn’t a normal politician, he’s an authoritarian and wants more power. This would’ve given him cover to declare a national emergency.   Under the National Emergencies Act, Trump could have redirected Medicaid or Snap funds to ICE or military operations, suspended civil liberties, and fired tens of thousands of federal workers, with no ability to challenge any of it in court. It would let him finish the project Musk began but it would’ve been turbo charged.  He and Musk and Vought would have purged the federal bureaucracy and installed loyalists in key agencies. All of it could’ve been done under the guise of “National Security”.  Trump would have selectively funded what he decided were “essential services” like ICE, Border Patrol, and the military while starving out the other agencies that might have slowed him down or he doesn’t like. And without the courts, he would’ve effectively created a militarized state while crushing any legal resistance. He could choose to pay only certain officers who would still be required to work during a Shutdown, making them loyal to him.    The other key part of the plan would be blaming Democrats. The GOP media machine would be blaming Democrats for the chaos, radicalizing the MAGA base, and convincing the public that only he could restore order, which would actually be true. This is literally how Putin consolidated power in Russia and how Erdogan dismantled democracy in Turkey. During the COVID pandemic, Viktor Orbán used the opposition’s refusal to agree to the pandemic measures he proposed as an excuse to seize power and shifted funds from hospitals and social programs to private police forces and border patrol units.  As the shutdown continued for months (and it would have) he could claim, “The country is too unstable for elections,” delaying the 2026 midterms or even refusing to leave office in 2028. This was the GOP’s real plan. That’s why McConnell and House Republicans quietly supported the CR, which they normally hate. Musk & Trump were hoping Democrats would fall into the trap and force the shutdown, giving Trump the excuse he needed to seize authoritarian power and flip the narrative.  Schumer and the others didn’t “cave” by keeping the government funded. They took the least bad option and bought us time. It stopped Trump from pulling the trigger for now but he will find another moment and it won’t be long.  We need Trump’s popularity to continue bottoming out and right now he is getting all the blame for everything. But the media would have dropped that and started both sidesing every job loss and negative story about the economy the minute Dems made their votes official. And not just the job losses. The economy tanking, consumer confidence… Everything would have been been framed as being the Dems fault too. That cannot be allowed to happen..we need this outrage to keep building and in only one direction.  We need his approval in the 30s. We need members of Congress worried about getting shouted out of Grocery Stores, never mind Town Halls.  It’s much much harder to cancel elections with a 33% approval after sending the economy into recession, when he won’t have the backing of the corporate elites or normies in Red States, than it is when you’re at 45% and CEOs are only warning about a potential recession, and only on deep background. That’s not a country ready to stand up to Donald Trump.  As I said, the CR is terrible..but it still forces Trump to keep operating within the system of normal governance. We need that for now..it’s too early to blow it all up. Not enough people are on our side yet. Even if it would have felt much better to stand up to him and not pass it.",Early-Juggernaut975,2025-03-17T19:07:21,35

"I think Democrat politicians were in a lose-lose situation.  Oppose Trump and force a shutdown (which is what the Dem base wants), but then risk more federal employees getting cut by Musk/DOGE and getting blamed by Trump and conservative media (thereby taking the heat off Trump)  Work with Republicans to avoid shutdown and federal workers getting laid off, but then you hand Trump and Republicans a “victory” and face the wrath of your own Dem base  Either way, I think there’s going to be major turnover as the Democratic Party is going to have its own Tea Party movement ahead of 2026 midterms.

"Republicans were willing to shut down the government at least temporarily. Heck look at what  DOGE is trying to do to the federal government now. A government shutdown would give the Trump administration even more legal leverage to do extraordinary things.   Democrats only leverage was the senate filibuster and threatening to shut down government with it. Say democrats used it, what happens next? Shutting down the government to try to save the government? Once the government is shut down, it’s unclear whether you’ll get a better deal and the Dems will be under steadily increasing pressure to cave to any deal. Dems are pissed because it sucks to be locked out of government.   Their greatest strength is being locked out of power. Political gravity is going to drag down Trump and Republicans like an albatross. As long as Dems don’t do anything stupid like contributing to a shutdown, they are golden. Majorities of mass opinion AND majorities of elite opinion will steadily sour on Trump like rotten milk.

I am not at all sympathetic to an approach that treats this as an obvious solution with only one right answer, and anything less than that is pure political failure.

"Senate Dems made the calculated decision that was the correct decision.   They bet that Mike Johnson couldn’t pass a bill without dem votes so they encouraged the house to kill the bill.   When the GOP passed it on their own it became clear that was the only CR that was able to pass the House of Representatives and Schumer had to pass it or shut down the gov.   Schumer knows that Dems will forget about this and fall back in line by the midterms, whereas the GOP with their new age media proficiency will NEVER let people forget that Democrats shut down the government.  One must understand that Trump, Elon, and the GOP right now are infinitely better at pumping their rhetoric and their vision of events throughout the media world than Democrats are.

"Yeah, Schumer did the 100% correct thing with the cards he was given.    The democrats would have been blamed for the shutdown, and the public would have been right to blame them for it.   You had progressives going on TV every day advocating for a shutdown unless Republicans agreed to put in language that stops DOGE and other parts of the Trump agenda. This is a good goal to have, but the politics wouldn't have worked.   For one, saying you are saving federal workers' jobs by shutting down the government is hypocritical immediately to anyone who hears it.   Second, stopping DOGE isn't popular enough to get over the stink of a government shutdown. DOGE isn't trumps most popular initiative, but it still polls in the mid to high 40s and even the low 50s with the public when you don't mention Elon directly. There just isn't enough outrage over the subject to make drastic action popular.   Third, and most importantly, there are dozens if not hundreds of clips of prominent Democrats illustrating why government shutdowns are never a good idea and don't help anything. Using pretty absolue language. There was no way they could not immediately look like massive hypocrits/liars if they went through with the shutdown.   Simply, there was no way for Democrats to not lose the publicity war on this one. They would be forced to end the shutdown in a week and look like fools. There were also already number of senate democrats willing to break ranks already, so it's entirely possible that if Schumer whipped the votes against the bill, they would have made it a very uncomfortable vote, and would have then been on TV trashing the shutdown with some very notable names being very against the shutdown publicly,  which would make the rest of the democrats look bad. There wasn't an optics win, and it the only thing it would do is make democrats more unpopular and give Trump more power in the interim. There was no path to a political win.",getawarrantfedboi,2025-03-17T18:05:43,10

"To be clear - neither solution is good. But something to keep in mind, is that if the government is not funded, we're talking millions of people are not getting paid - not just federal employees but also a lot of private businesses and contracts that the government pays. We're talking LOTS of very unhappy people. Even in that situation, the president gets unilateral control in determining which federal employees MUST work - but even that situation is pretty awful because all federal employees are given backpay when the government is funded, so imagine being the person that has to work without pay for an undetermined amount of time. Morale is incredibly low and when rent comes due, you still need to figure something out.   I think Democrats concocted in their minds, that during this scenario that Trump/Musk could just keep things closed for as long as they want while they just slash and burn but i don't think they really thought about how much public pressure and outrage would be growing on Trump and Musk during this time. Funding  the government allows the downward spiral to continue; i don't see a reality where Trump suddenly becomes more popular - he'll just continue to bleed support. Not funding the government would have been a pretty sudden and immediate support freefall.   My only thought about what Democratic politicians were thinking, is the larger thought around a leader of a war torn country whose about lose power and you risk a power vacuum. You try to insulate the leader and control externalities so that when the collapse does come, you can control partially who ends up on top. I think Democrats may be trying to intentionally bleed this as close to an election as possible because if he collapses support to soon, he may start doing truly dangerous things (ie: Shooting protesters) and that changes things quite a bit..",chaoticflanagan,2025-03-17T19:34:35,3

The only big-ticket ""positive action"" that the Trump administration has engaged in is with respect to deportations and border enforcement. Other than that, their actions have been purely destructive, and we all know that it's easier to break something than it is to build it.  The obvious means of resisting the ongoing efforts of the POTUS aren't very snappy or Tweetable: the judicial fight is going to be long and full of appeals, and the legislature has little *direct* influence over the executive branch, though it can pass laws and assign funding in order to influence our national direction.

"Your final question presumes the fact that a government shutdown would be blamed on democrats and would risk democratic house prospects. I reject that premise entirely.   It should be abundantly clear by now that elections are no longer decided by a party or candidate’s legislative record - if that were the case, republicans would have already lost the house last time following their forced government shutdowns, speaker drama and power struggles, lack of legislative accomplishments and total disarray while in the majority. Elections are decided by messaging and optics above all else now, and at a time when democrats have (rightfully) called out the current Republican Party as dangerous authoritarians, I can’t think of a worse message to send to potential voters than joining them in passing their reckless budget in hopes of it helping Dems politically in a couple of years.  Republicans have a trifecta. If a voter blames Democrats for the Republican majority not being able to avoid a shutdown, that person was never going to vote for a democrat anyways, and we shouldn’t waste time pandering to those people if that same pandering infuriates the core democratic base and makes them look even weaker and more servile than they’re already viewed.

"The idea was for Democrats to save the country from itself, or rather, to save the country from Trump. He and his administration, in addition to threatening war with or abandonment of our allies, getting chummy with dictators, dismantling our government and destroying services like Social Security, are attacking our fundamental Constitutional rights: the right to an attorney when charged with a crime, the freedom of the press, the first amendment freedom of speech, etc. A shutdown would have given Trump the excuse he needs to complete his destruction of the Constitution and all our rights. He and his people need only the flimsiest excuses to do anything, and a government shutdown would have given them the excuse to go full steam ahead with installing Trump as absolute ruler, unconstrained by Congress, courts, laws, or morality.        But the Democrats acquiescence is merely a veneer that puts a gloss of legitimacy over the administration's plans, and temporarily delays their destruction of our rights, freedoms and democracy by a few days, or weeks, or months at the most.

"This was the first CR in decades, possibly ever, that has passed both the house and senate with zero consultation with the minority party. Even as a pity obligation, every single one has involved at least one person from the other party to give it a go-ahead. Schumer set the precedent that this is okay.  Republicans even included what should have been a poison pill where it gives Trump the power to sidestep congress completely on budget decisions and the Democrats simply rubber stamped it. The claim that they're worried about all the government workers who will lose their jobs in a shutdown rings hollow when you're coronating Trump to slash and burn entire government entities at a whim anyway.  Moreover, Schumer agreed with the plan from the House Democrats to stay united against it. They all voted against the CR because *that was the strategy everyone decided on.* For Schumer to just go ""Actually, never mind"" is a betrayal of his colleagues driven, I assume, by his belief that senators matter more and he should not have to listen to members of the house.  In the future, every spending spending bill from Republicans will be negotiated simply among themselves, passed through the house easily, and they can assume Democrats in the senate will bend their spine as much as it takes for Republicans. Why not? It clearly works. They had leverage to stop them or at least clean up the CR and gave it all up.  Democrats live in fear that the center might possibly be mad at them, but they never consider shaping the message themselves to prevent that. They take Democratic votes for granted despite that being the cause of their electoral losses and don't care if their own base is mad at them.",DazeLost,2025-03-18T11:34:57,1

"This seems like part of an ongoing strategy by Schumer and Jefferies: let Trump take all the attention and fall flat on his face for all to see.  Attempting to mitigate the damage that Trump does, just makes him seem more competent. Trump shamelessly takes credit for everything good, and finds a scapegoat for everything bad. Whenever Democrats have prevented him from doing something disastrous, Trump is able to claim that it would have worked all the failures of his administration are due to Democrats sabotaging him.  Shutting down the government to prevent Trump from downsizing the government, doesn't prove anything to anyone. Once the government *does* reopen, Trump can then assign any of the failings of his administration to the ""chaos"" caused by the ""Democrat's shutdown."" Any loss in services from his mismanagement will be confused with the loss in services from the shutdown. He will likely be able to convince his base that the downturn in the economy from his tariffs are actually due to the shutdown somehow, and they will believe it.  Since it is clear that Trump is more than a one-term fluke, the Democrats have to find a new way to actively beat Trump and people *like* Trump, and not just wait out the clock till their term is over. The only way to beat someone who promises the moon is to call their bluff. Let them try and deliver the moon, don't give them *any* excuses for failure by impeding them, then watch them fail hard on full public display.   If the American people never learn to reject a con-man like Trump, then our future is going to be one long stream of con-men and people trying to mitigate their harm. However, if you *let* Trump cause a recession through his trade war, allow government services that his supporters rely on to get cut, allow our exports to tank from boycotts because he has made us an international pariah, and have him take credit for all of it, *then* reality might come knocking for the American voter.",Wang_Dangler,2025-03-18T15:24:58,1

"The continuing resolution (CR) that was approved consolidates the powers of the Executive Branch and takes away powers from the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch.  The continuing resolution lets the president unilaterally form new MILITARY programs. Senator Chris Murphy talks about it in an interview with Jon Stewart.  The continuing resolution gives the president the right to cut any program without the need for congressional approval.  The continuing resolution gives the president the authority to raise tariffs unilaterally. Yes, he has been doing this already, but this CR makes what he did legal.  The continuing resolution legalizes the illegal actions that the Executive Branch have been taking taking since the inauguration, such as firing people who predict our weather (NOAA), who help people after disasters (FEMA), who monitor our nuclear facilities (DOE), who provide many of us with health insurance and who help veterans, etc. These firings were illegal and the courts have been fighting these actions. But due to this year's CR, the courts will no longer have authority to continue lawsuits against the Executive Branch.  Here is rebuttal to the people mentioning those who would be harmed by a government shutdown:  First, thank you for thinking of, and advocating for, our most vulnerable Americans. Yet please understand something important.  Most of the people repeatedly calling and writing their legislators to vote no to cloture and no to the continuing resolution were people who will be affected strongly either way, i.e. people who are recipients of Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, SNAP benefits, and Veterans who will lose services at the VA.  The argument was ""We are willing to see a temporary stop of our benefits, in order to prevent this administration from making severe cuts to our benefits permanently.""

It was a no win situation and Democrats chose the (much) lesser of two evils. People complain about little performative signs at the SotU but really wanted dems to let all hell break loose?

The House passed it and left town meaning the issue would have to be decided by the Senate. There was no option of sending something back to the House. Cleary Johnson and Thune worked this out. The options for the Senate dems then consisted of voting for cloture or not. If not, the dems would be responsible for the legislation dying. The dems would have been responsible for the shutdown.   Once shutdown what leverage would the dems have had? Especially when it would have been the ""Schumer shutdown."" The Republicans would have had even more leverage in this situation.

"In fairness, neither party has ""a fundamental platform"".  The Republicans are largely single-issue groups wrapped around classical conservatives... and since 2016, also hate groups and tinfoilers.  Democrats are everybody else.  It's a Big Tent, but much smaller than it should be considering.  The problem with picking *A* platform is that it will alienate a good chunk of Democrats.  A little over half of Democratic voters are neoliberals and moderates.  That is neither enough to dominate elections nor small enough to pivot away from.  The party thought it was well-positioned to continue left in the 90's, and got itself a rude awakening with the meteoric rise of Third Way.  American Voters are ultimately fairly conservative people whenever the IDEA of progress gets too big. But they have to be weak on that ""moderate conservativism"" because they can't win regularly with *just* that.  It's been that way for decades and I don't see any way for Democrats to improve at it.  What really needs to happen is progressive reform from within.  People like Warren who can get a conservative Democrat nodding about a progressive policy, and people like Walz who can be that conservative Democrat who sees the inherent value in moving left.

"The problem is that this wouldn't be a ""normal"" shutdown. Under an appropriations lapse, the executive branch still carries on ""national defense,"" ""law enforcement,"" and ""preserve life and property"" functions (that's the ""essential"" designation, technically an ""excepted"" tag).  Now remember we have DOGE champing at the bit to gut the government. Federal employees are being directed to report what they did each week to a DOGE-established email box (ostensibly as a ""pulse check"" but everybody with a brain knows they're feeding it into an AI model to try to target functions). And the POTUS issued an Executive Order to all agencies to come up with a ""Reduction in Force"" (RIF) plan that orders ""all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations"" be prioritized.  The fear is that a shutdown isn't ""just another shutdown."" A shutdown is Republicans going ""everybody that's furloughed? You're being RIFed because you're not 'essential.'"" Remember, DOGE's original goal was to cut federal employment by 75%. DOD is by far the largest agency employer, and *more than half* of DOD civilian employees are furloughed during a shutdown. Because logistics, planning, readiness, etc aren't directly engaged in national defense - we're talking people that aren't on the front lines if Russia invades Alaska tomorrow, but make sure the force can fight if Russia invades Alaska next year.  Avoiding the shutdown is an attempt to keep the federal government from being hollowed out overnight, so that Democrats, unions, and public sentiment have a chance to push back on Republican efforts to gut the government over the medium term. Because as we're seeing in the fight over firing and reinstating probationary employees, once people are gone, the administration is going to do everything they can to keep them gone.

A few weeks ago it was first frozen and then disappeared from the website entirely. The reason they got was that it was because they have some sort of program or initiative for for clean air and water in poorer sections of Philadelphia which are predominantly minority. This doesn’t line up with the DEI priorities of the Trump Administration evidently.   Anyway, those funds would not show as available anywhere because they were allocated already. Yet now they are available for wherever Trump wants to send them I suppose.  During a shutdown, some things would continue to be funded like SNAP and Medicaid. Trump could order the Sec of Agriculture for SNAP and HHS for Medicaid to freeze all outgoing payments, disbursements to states that were already committed, etc. Especially to Blue States.

> making things as terrible as possible is probably the best way to get the people to wake the fuck up.   My counter-argument to that is that Democrat voters don't have much leverage to really push back. Are they willing to stop sending federal taxes? Are they willing to form militia if it really came down to it*?   \* Schumer is basically saying if the government shutdown happens we go into authoritarianism or balkanization.

"I disagree that the courts have been ineffective. Although it's true that the administration is, thus far, ignoring various court orders, the lack of apparent action is just the process of escalation to higher courts. The end question is what will happen if POTUS and SCOTUS butt heads and we have a ""constitutional crisis"".  I'm also not sure what actions you are suggesting. Protests are fine for calling attention to an issue, but they will not be any more effective than court orders, and Trump still has strong support. You can swamp your Dem representatives and senators, but a DDOS' worth of spam isn't going to help them to get anything done, and they already disagree with and are working (in some way) to correct or combat the direction of the Exectutive Branch.  Federal legislators will continue to work to secure/preserve funding for their States. State legislators should be thinking about how to run programs they need that lose federal funding.  I think that donating to funds or NGOs that are fighting the legal battles is probably the most effective form of supporting the causes important to you. ""Civil Disobedience"" in the form of not paying taxes doesn't work when the gov't doesn't want to spend your money, though it's an option if they are spending it ""incorrectly"".  In short, the Exec Branch is the only one that can act unilaterally or quickly. Anything the other branches do will require time and cooperation between at least 2 of them.

"💯 The “leverage” everyone talks about was only an illusion.  Democrats were the minority in both the House and the Senate. They didn’t write the CR, couldn’t amend it, and didn’t have the votes to block it without triggering a shutdown. And that’s exactly what Trump and Musk wanted—a shutdown they could use to fire more workers, dismantle more programs, and blame Democrats.  The idea that Schumer “surrendered leverage” is wishful thinking. It wasn’t leverage—it was a trap. And refusing to spring it wasn’t weakness. It was damage control.  Millions of vulnerable people, including me, would have been hurt instantly. I say this not as a political strategist, but as someone who could have lost my home during this process. The student loan application freeze threw my loan payments into chaos. They went from an estimated $40/month to a hard $262/month. I don’t yet have the teaching job I went to school for. I’m scraping by as it is. If the government had shut down, I’d have been stuck in limbo—and I’m not alone. Millions rely on things like SNAP, WIC, and housing assistance. This wasn’t some abstract ideological fight. It was people’s lives on the line.  People talk about understanding the stakes. I hope you will all consider those of us living at ground level, not just in ivory towers, or podcast studios.   But especially if the shutdown would not have harmed you: If you were safe. If you weren’t going to miss a paycheck. If you weren’t going to lose your home or benefits, why do you have no problem shaming a Democratic leader who chose to prevent mass suffering?

Trump’s appointee, Barrett, is receiving death threats because she ruled against impoundment of USAID commitments.  And Trump tries to be all buddy buddy with Roberts.  Why do you think that is?  But courts take time and the administration speeding orders is an attempt to overrun the judiciary.

"It's a real shit show, to be sure. On the bright side, I'm having trouble confirming whether court orders that were at least initially brushed off continued to be defied.  [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/03/17/did-trump-administration-ignore-a-court-order-judge-demands-trump-officials-explain/) discusses the recent ruling against the El Salvador deportations, with White House officials alleging that allowing the *departed* flights to continue had some (debatable) justifications; the point being, though, that they implied that further flights would not violate the order.  When it comes to the mass firings and subsequent reversal, it is similarly unclear whether those workers have returned to work. This [NBC article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/federal-workers-future-uncertain-court-finds-firings-illegal-rcna196506) seems to imply that at least some have, but that they continue to feel insecure in their employment, which is completely understandable. Along similar lines, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5318039/fired-federal-employees-opm-memo) discusses the OPM walking back language in a memo such that it did not call for terminations (since that is outside their scope), but that it's not necessarily known how the targeted agencies responded (i.e. did the individual agencies/managers/directors reach out and bring people back).  Arguably, all of our talk of the administration not following orders is probably making things worse insofar as it reduces faith in a system that actually is working (or at least its cogs are turning), just not as quickly as people that want it to. People want things to change instantly, but that's not how the legislature or judiciary work. People seem to be calling for Republican-style disruption, but disruption is the goal of this administration, and you can't really fight disruption with disruption - further clogging the gears is just going to muck up the works, worse.

"You have a strategy for everything. They are not rubber stamps, and have a purpose beyond keeping the government open. There is a reason to shut the government down, which is to end the destruction of government agencies by forcing an enforcement mechanism for making sure the legally allocated money is spent where it is legally allocated. The purpose of the budget is making sure specific things are funded, not giving the president money for whatever he wants. The ""CR"" was fast closer to the second description than any budget ever put forward. The reason to shut the government down is to preserve the parts of the government you want funded.   The argument against letting the government shut down is that Musk would be able to accomplish far more destruction with the government closed and having less oversight over him. That is questionable and can't be known, but is likely accelerating both the destruction of the government as well as the discontent amongst the populace. Concern over what the government shutdown looks like is understandable. I personally wanted the shutdown, but I'm not demanding it.

I wish they had told Republicans to get rid of the filibuster if they wanted to pass a bill that has zero Democratic input because it would get zero Democratic votes.

Bypassing the filibuster for Republicans, but doing it in a way that makes it clear they don't want to hurt Americans with a government shutdown, but we're still against the bill.

Without going into detail, that is NOT how agencies are interpreting that, to the best of my personal knowledge.  > You also appear to not understand the definition of ""furlough"".  The technical definition is in 5 USC 7511, in case you were wondering:  >(5) ""furlough"" means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary reasons.  It comes out of the Anti-Deficiency Act, where the executive can't spend money that hasn't been appropriated. No funds, no work, no pay. 31 USC 1341 says furloughed and excepted alike get backpay, but if you trust the Congressional Republican majority to not change that, then you trust them a lot further than a lot of other people. Prior to 2019, backpay even for ""excepted from furlough"" workers was custom, not law, and if the current situation has shown us anything, ""custom"" is no guarantee of ANYTHING.  And having actually *been* subject to furlough (including a ""you're on the furlough list, but if XYZ happens then we'll call you and you'll be ""essential"" for the three hours it takes to deal with it, then you can go back on furlough"" position back in 2019, that was fun - because what is furloughed and excepted is determined by the activity, not the person, and some people conduct a wide variety of activities), as well as going through all the lapse of appropriations drills in prep for shutdowns several times over my career, maybe think again.
