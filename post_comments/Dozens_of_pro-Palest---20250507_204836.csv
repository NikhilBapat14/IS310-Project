Violating their first amendment rights.    This is one of the features of fascism. The state does not have to enforce all the rules or conduct all the oppressive state terror.   They can induce or co-opt other institutions in society to do their dirty work for them.    I continue to get into arguments here on Reddit politics people who cannot bring themselves to admit that we are living under a fascist regime. The reason why it matters is because fascist regimes do not allow free and fair elections.    Many of the people I'm arguing with admit the things are pretty dark right now but they're for sure we'll fix them in 2026 at the midterms.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T20:54:04,-8

Hamas accepted a ceasefire numerous times (going back to May 2024) only for Israel to move the goal posts at the last minute - he then blamed Hamas (even though international and Israeli media made it clear it was Israel to blame). * His own Secretary of State lied to Congress about Israel blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza - he withheld a joint DOS/USAID report that found that Israel was purposely blocking aid.",walkallover1991,2025-05-07T22:09:42,17

If what you want is a milquetoast, center-right Democratic Party that will never challenge the status quo, then congratulations, that is what you have. This mythical “far left” Democratic Party exists only in Fox News propaganda. You’re afraid of something that just isn’t real.   And lmao because there is no “extreme left” in this country. McCarthy and his band of reprobates spent half a century systematically destroying left-wing movements, and they were extraordinarily successful.

"I think there can be a world where our options aren't evil or slightly less evil.  I voted for Kamala, so I understand the logistics of lesser evil voting, but democrats need to learn that they can't just expect votes on the basis of 'not as bad as the other guy'.   Votes have to be won with ideas and principles. Instead of dogging on the person who rightfully wasnt convinced by Kamala's doctrine, yell at Kamala and the democrats for failing to convince that voter.   Otherwise, democrats wont learn a thing, and we'll continue bouncing between horrible fascists and status quo liberals forever (or until we dont get to vote anymore).  Also, for the record, we are on the same side (for the most part).

"If you are speaking of actual military and intel support, Jordan and Egypt (and to some degree Turkey) have proven themselves to be reliable and capable partners in the region.

Destabilizing the region (and preventing any pan-Arab movements) is a key tenant of that strategy.   Obviously, AIPAC plays a role as well.",walkallover1991,2025-05-07T23:46:14,7

If you read the article you would know the groups name is literally **Columbia University Apartheid Divest**, so that, you know, might explain why they're protesting at Columbia, as opposed to seven hours away in Washington.

"Again, you're alleging a conspiracy with this cutesty bullshit roundabout way asking leading questions, and I don't know why lmao. Liteally just say what you mean. It isn't hard. Say the thing you want to say.  Since you won't, let me say what I think you're trying to say.   Did China, Israel, Russia, and probably other state actors placed their thumbs on the scale of the election in 2024 by ramping up anti-Israel propaganda amongst student and muslim-American groups using a wide array of attack vectors?  Yes. They absolutely poured gasoline on the Gaza fire with the explicit goal of diriving a wedge in teh Democratic base.   All that is true, while at the same time, it is true that a lot of people are fucking pissed that Democrats kept funding Israel throughout the genocide, and that a genocide is a super fucked up thing to do.   I was one such Democrat. I think Biden's utter failure on the Israeli genocide was a catastrophic failure of his presidency, and one that Harris didn't think important enough to remediate during her campaign. I voted for Harris, because I am not nearly as emotional as many voters, and Harris was clearly better for the US, the world, and Gaza than Trump.  But many were swayed by the propaganda to not vote for Harris.  What you seem to be implying, without having the balls to come right out and say, is  that the fact that the former is true, means the latter isn't true. That the fact there was propaganda means **all** protestors against Israel are fake and all of them are working for Trump or have ulterior motives.  But that isn't how the world works. The rage against Israel and Gaza was already there. Bad actors across the spectrum merely weaponized it through conventional media and controlled media outlets like TikTok to turn it into a nuclear bomb to use against the Harris campaign for their own geopolitical purposes.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-07T22:22:48,4
