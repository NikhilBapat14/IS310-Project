I commend the visionaries who take the lead on this kind of stuff but count me as one less to save. I would rather die on earth then go live on another planet.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-06T08:16:34,28
"While I am not a NASA Scientist, I have watched and researched a bit.  We need to establish a Moonbase first. There is oxygen and water available on the moon. It is in the rocks but it is there. Once you have a large enough base to live in, you have hydroponics for food, plenty of air and water. Next you setup mining on the moon which due to all the meteor impacts is also very rich in minerals.  THEN once this is done, you can build a ship in lower gravity making it easier. Taking what we learn from establishing a moonbase and launching to Mars.  Simple theory, lot of work in reality.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T05:44:08,26
"Settling Mars needs to be an afterthought. All the time and resources spent sinking a bunch of mass into the bottom of another planetary gravity well would go much further building habitats and infrastructure in/on/around the moon, our Lagrange points, and the asteroids and other rocky/icy bodies that are nearby.  After that, the asteroid belt is the next logical place, followed by some of Jupiter's moons. Mars *might* be tied for third place, but realistically once we're living in space there wouldn't be much point.  Research outposts and vanity projects aside, settling Mars within a meaningful time frame doesn't have much an argument for it.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-06T13:00:22,4
"How would Mars maintain an atmosphere? It's magnetic field is non-existent. Solar wind would rip it apart.  Unless we can somehow turn Mars into a giant magnet, it ain't happening. I appreciate Elon's enthusiasm though.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-06T06:47:13,16
"'We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.'",vampirepomeranian,2025-05-06T10:41:36,3

Lot of work from Kennedy's moonshot speech to the actual moon shot.  If the motivation and dedication is there it can be done. ,beamerbeliever,2025-05-06T10:14:16,3
"Theoretically if you terraformed Mars to have an atmosphere, the atmosphere would stay viable for thousands of years, and if you could terraform it once, you could continue to add atmosphere at the rate it’s being stripped away. Theoretically.",jpj77,2025-05-06T09:34:12,6

It would be very easy in the future to build nanobots that could theoretically form a protective coating around the atmosphere and absorb solar energy when nanotechnology becomes a thing.,AldrichOfAlbion,2025-05-06T11:05:24,1

"People are afraid.... oh no someone died trying to expand our world and universe. We gotta stop or more will die.  BUT for example, People die in the 100's every year during construction of buildings. Why don't we stop building stuff because people die in the process?  But only 188 people worldwide over 50 years have died going into space... so lets cancel the whole thing, just send robots and be scared little kids staying on Mother Earth and don't let others who are willing to take that risk to expand our boundaries.  You can have a 100 people die in an airplane crash but we don't stop airplanes from flying.  It is time to get back into space and push the boundaries of our knowledge and our world.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T10:27:08,5
"You'd need to extrapolate the cost of material that blocks solar radiation to an inordinate degree. I can't imagine the base cost of that, if it's even feasible possible yet with current tech.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-06T07:39:58,13
"I'm actually surprised 188 people have died in space exploration. I would have thought that number was way lower.  But you're right. Countless people died setting out across the Atlantic to colonize America. Countless more died pushing westward. And that's just a tiny slice of humanity's pursuit of exploration.  If people want to live in their little bubble wrapped spaces, great, you do you. But don't try to strong arm the people who are willing to die for the cause. If Elon Musk gets a few dozen volunteers to go to Mars and build a colony, who are we to stop them in the name of safety? Nobody that is willing to train to go Mars is going to be unaware of the zero-margin-of-error risks involved.",the_house_from_up,2025-05-06T11:26:48,3
Whatever the cost will be of achieving a self sustaining permanent civilization on mars.   It's gonna be cheaper to fix shit here,Dutchtdk,2025-05-06T10:13:06,14
"Elon’s entire premise is that they mine everything locally as soon as possible, as in it’s a must - not a wish.  He made me think when he said most things would be automated. Tesla bots are real and are happening.  Imagine Tesla bots mining materials, refining metals, building robots that will build - robots.  Robots building everything, even if no humans are on the entire planet.   I was a ln Elon doubter for years.  Tesla?  Hey trap FFS, that won’t work!  Private space travel?  Don’t make me laugh, NASA is the king of space!  But he’s proven me so very-very wrong so many times I finally just realized the dude is a freak of genius and leaned that when he says something, take the timeline with a grain of salt - but don’t discount the entire project because it didn’t meet an early proposed timeline.",cliffotn,2025-05-06T11:25:25,0
I was surprised but that is both Russian and US as well as miscellaneous countries combined.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T11:45:00,3
"I don't doubt that Elon has the technology to make that happen, but we have to realistically look at the sheer amount of material that would be *needed* to make a habitable ecosystem on Mars the way it is.   You would need super expensive material by the square kilometer for things like solar radiation protection, pressurization, etc. You're almost building something akin to an international space station on a city-sized level. That would be an absolute inordinate amount of money. The technology may be there but the price point would be beyond astronomical.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-06T13:43:48,1
> solar radiation protection  A big concern not only on the planet but traveling to it.  Serious talk of establishing the colony next to .. or inside .. a canyon for protection.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-06T14:28:05,1
"I hear you, and I get you, I’m just telling you after experience of me personally going through this evolution multiple times, coming up with and listening to all the reasons why everything Elon has done won’t work, I’ve kind of given up. The dude keeps on proving me and everybody else wrong over and over again and again and again.   Whether it be Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, NeuralLink, whatever.   The experts, the commentators, and self included come up with a reason after reason why he hasn’t thought of something.  And then when someone actually asks them, it actually has been thinking about it and working on solutions for a long time.",cliffotn,2025-05-06T14:48:35,1
"Oh yeah. If anyone can do it, it's him. We have self landing rockets now, after all.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-06T14:51:13,1
