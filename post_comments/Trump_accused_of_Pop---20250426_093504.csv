It was an elegant way to fully comply with the dress code of “dark suit.”   I’m sure he also had a black tie and the requested black button.  Italy sets the tone for men’s formal wear, and Biden totally rocked the vibe.  I’ll bet his belt and shoes matched too.  He fit in, and represented the USA well.    Trump?  Was he wearing clown shoes too?  He was totally disrespectful.  He looked every bit the low-class grifter scum from Queens that he is.  But “they both wore blue.”  Bah!!

"I'm agnostic. But I still recognize and respect the religious beliefs of others even though I may not believe in them; of course, there are limitations to how far that goes.  But Trump's willingness or ignorance in disrespecting the sanctity and decorum of the proceedings. Would be in poor taste at any funeral. But when it is the fucking Pope, it adds a whole other layer to the issue.  And people are right to question his actions.  Though religion can be either silly or even down right oppressive and harmful. We shouldn't handwave away people's disrespect.  As all actions speak to the character of their owner.  So I think maybe you should reconsider being dismissive of the whole situation. Yes, there are more serious actions Trump should be judged upon - and no doubt they *also* judge him for those actions too.

The same way it does with any parent who placates their child instead of actually teaching them boundaries - they become a tyrant.   The Trump administration is literally doing the same things that Hitler did leading up to WWII. They are talking about making a registry of autistic people and have started arresting judges. They have ignored the rule of law and their own constitution. At what point do we globally fully acknowledge that it isn't a ""this might happen"" and a ""they are currently actively trying to achieve this""?  I am not so much worried about war breaking out because there is so much internal conflict in the US, in addition to reliance on other countries that their own government seems to be delusional about but is still necessary to scale up any type of response, to be able to do much.. not to mention, most of Trump's rich supporters have their wealth tied up in stocks.. and those stocks will entirely be meaningless if the rest of the world turns their back on the US.. but how many people are going to suffer in the meantime?

Just different names. Library and university just the most common. But even many religious temples around the world. The Vatican has a library that goes back to the middle ages and before for example.

Until the internet libraries and universities were considered THE place to learn things. Libraries are the record of all of history. People put to much importance on the internet and not enough on good old fashioned books. A single solar storm could knock out the internet in a heartbeat. If your going to question a place of learning, why even want to do the learning in first place.",Diamond1441,2025-04-27T13:49:13,1

"Biden isn’t a current head of state representing the people of his country at a major international event.   He *is* a catholic with as many members of his immediate family dead as are alive, though, so he’s certainly clear on what is and isn’t appropriate to wear to a catholic funeral.",basherella,2025-04-26T11:55:00,3
"I'm sorry, what's the point you're trying to make??? that it has to be in a physical book in a library or a university to be truthful information? and whenever I read anything on the internet I need to take a trip to the library to verify if it's true?   Is Wikipedia not good enough? that contains pretty much the entirety of the world's knowledge and provides the sources where it got that information and is constantly being fact checked.",CyanSlinky,2025-04-27T13:58:10,1

"No wikipedia is NOT good enough. Its why it is not allowed as a citian in academic and professional papers. ANYONE can edit wikipedia, I could go on to wikipedia, change the info on ANY wikipedia page. I could go write the sky is red and it would be in wiki til someone else changes it. And that can be a LONG time sometimes (fact checking is done by regular people that can change it on there own, true or not.) , in the meantime people that read the wiki pages are told the wrong info that the sky is red. And no you dont have to have everything in a physical book. But the library computers give access to so much more then just the internet. They have peer to peer periodicals, meaning that someone published a paper, a different researcher (or usually multiple different researchers) conducts the experiment themselves and then replies back that yes or no hey were not able to repeat the findings. Its like asking a friend to check your work. And this researchers that are peer to peer are getting MAJOR money grants for there research and thus is any falsehoods are found they usually lose there grants. This is a very rough breakdown of how the system works. These peer to peer research studies sometimes are not reported in the general media for months, sometimes years. So yes peer to peer research is MUCH MORE ACCURATE. You can also access much of the information through the libraries system online. So no physical trip is not always necessity. Let me clear this up, the internet can be totally made up with no source in reality, and because people have forgotten what libraries and institutions of higher learning are for, everyone just believes the internet.  Its things like that, that allow presidents to get away with calling everything but what he says as fake news. Its called doing your own research instead of just accepting what the internet says is ""fact"". The internet is probably about 90% nonfactual and 10% factual/proven. While a library and using there resources flips that to 90 factual 10 made up. SO YES LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT",Diamond1441,2025-04-28T12:10:35,1

So then why bring the nobodies up at all? What's the point of throwing up chaff for this asshole? You can't seriously be worried that there will be some backlash against anyone wearing blue. People care when the President does it because he's the President. And the reason people care about it because it's Trump is because it's the sort of disrespectful shit that President Trump deliberately does all the goddamn time. That's it. There's no deeper reason.,-jp-,2025-04-26T13:53:06,2
"Also here in the USA if it ends [in.edu](http://in.edu) instead of .com, that means it is part of a educational system of some kind, usually colleges. So those are MUCH more likely to be accurate (for my personal belief system nothing in life in general is 100, just 99%) , so no physical books are not needed. Just knowing how to find factual information on the internet is needed and what site are good and what sites aren't. Things I learned how to do through libraries growing up in school even. According to this Stanford study (Stanford is a top USA school, and notice the edu on the end of address) over 20,000 hoaxes have started on wikipedia.
