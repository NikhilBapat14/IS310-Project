"For the most part, the rest of the world isn't reacting to it. China building trade with Africa is a natural extension of the peaceful economic activity.  Moreover, the more closely they tie their economy with places like Africa, the more confidence the rest of the world has that China will maintain a peaceful posture in the world since losing those economic links would cause hardship in China itself - and it would be impossible for China to maintain such ties in the face of an ongoing conflict.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-05T06:45:24,16

"China has been buying up swaths of land containing rare earth elements for decades. On a world stage China plays the long game as they are regime based and know most world countries will change politically every 4 to 8 years. They plan for this and have been slowly buying up reserves dating back to the 70s and 80s. Back then the demand was less as tech increases and one of the world leaders in producing electronics, batteries, micro chips ect. Is going to need more supply. So they buy more land to keep costs down otherwise they would need to trade on the world stage giving them less power in the maket. So they strategically buy up land.",Pupwagn,2022-10-05T14:52:31,2
"Not too long ago, the US maintained a ""strategic Minerals Reserve"" with all the stuff we would need for our defense establishment that we don't have here in the USofA. Haven't heard about that for a decade or more, but apparently Red China has. My guess is Republicans eliminated ours from the budget to ""pay"" for tax cuts for the top or like tRump and the strategic medical reserve for pandemics, they just didn't fund the program..",Olderscout77,2022-10-05T06:36:23,4
"> I see this talked about (quietly) and I'd like to learn more about it. China's is buying up rare earth minerals and other components to future energy sources and technologies. What does this situation look like from a geopolitical stance? How is America and the rest of the world reacting to it?  Rare earth metals aren't rare, they're just dirty to mine. China has been cleaning up its environment and shut down a bunch of rare earth mines. Simultaneously they're embarking on the biggest electric vehicle and renewable energy program in the world, so they have a lot of demand for certain metals(mainly for wind turbines).  Consequently China has had to find new sources for their economy. And Africa has non-existent environmental standards so it was the natural choice. Nobody is talking about it because it's totally unimportant. There are many alternative technologies that do not use rare earth metals and the market is still very small in terms of dollar value. The minerals are not strategic or vital, they're just nice to have.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.asiafinancial.com/china-shuts-down-rare-earth-plants-over-environmental-concerns/amp",Fausterion18,2022-10-04T21:59:11,1
"As far as I can see America has no stance on Chinas current colonization of Africa. They are literally enslaving people, it’s wild that there is not a more public conversation about this right now. I do think America is trying its best to stay on Chinas good side and therefore quietly ignore what they are doing. I don’t have a deep insight here or citations, just curious what others have to say.",AlanTrebek,2022-10-04T19:44:26,1
I saw somewhere that there new currency (Russia and china) is based on rare minerals,wezley77,2022-10-05T05:02:21,1
"Well I’m not sure (the proof isn’t there) that any western country is concerned about the minerals in Africa. Meanwhile, china is building roads and traffic lights and such in exchange for promises of its precious metals. Ofc they think they’re the world superpower",br11481,2022-10-20T21:53:50,1
Rare earths are bank. China is staking out the future. My guess there is alot of closed room discussions but whatever they are talking about is not translating very well into concrete action.,phine-phurniture,2022-10-22T00:53:01,1
You may also be interested in the Chinese company Fufeng and it’s interest in land near Grand Forks North Dakota. It’s caused quite the uproar. It’s close proximity to a military installation as well as a very large recent land purchase in Pembina County to none other than Bill Gates.,[deleted],2022-10-28T21:32:19,1
"FEAM is involved in mining boron. Boron is regarded as a critical mineral because it helps to improve the strength of materials used in products such as airplanes, cars, and naval ships.     In addition to boron, FEAM is also involved in lithium extraction. Lithium is a metal that is used in batteries, and its demand is increasing due to the rise in popularity of electric vehicles.      So it's safe to say that this is a company that plays an important role in both the mining and extraction of critical minerals and metals.

Semiconductors use a trivial amount of rare earth minerals. The primary usage driver has been in permanent magnets for wind turbines and electric vehicles. In this application they provide about a 3% increase in efficiency which is good but hardly pivotal.,Fausterion18,2022-10-05T10:53:08,3
">They are literally enslaving people, it’s wild that there is not a more public conversation about this right now.  Because this is complete bullshit. Prove your claim with a credible source that this happens on any kind of scale.  >As far as I can see America has no stance on Chinas current colonization of Africa.  Ah yes, building infrastructure at the country's invitation is ""colonizing"".  >  I do think America is trying its best to stay on Chinas good side and therefore quietly ignore what they are doing.   The same US that's doing everything possible to stall China's economic and technological rise? The US just banned sale of GPUs used in machine learning to China on a completely bullshit pretext about ""potential military use"" in an attempt to slow down the Chinese software industry.  When it comes to ""China bad"" if the state department isn't screaming it out at the top of their lungs, then you know it's totally bullshit.",Fausterion18,2022-10-04T21:54:07,8
