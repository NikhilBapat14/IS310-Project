"I am pretty sure Trump doesn't know what ""photoshopped"" even means based on this exchange:  TRUMP: Oh, and you think it was Photoshop. Well --  TERRY MORAN: Here we go. Here we go.  TRUMP: -- don't Photoshop it. Go look --  TERRY MORAN: Alright.  ""Don't photoshop it, go look"" is not a sentence that makes sense in any context except one where the person uttering it is entirely ignorant of how that works.",Obvious-Gate9046,2025-05-01T12:33:01,1
Dude's brain is fully broken. He seriously believed that the M S 1 3 added to the pic of Garcia's knuckle tats to 'translate' was actually part of the tat.,travio,2025-05-01T12:40:56,1

"I love how he has to always give oddly specific numbers. He can't say ""almost 12,000"" or ""about 11,500"". It has to be ""11,888"". And relatedly:  > We had many murderers, 11,888, they think. Some murdered more than one person.  I'm honestly surprised that second sentence ended where it did. I was really expecting it to read ""Some murdered more than one person and some even murdered the same person multiple times.""",Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-01T13:06:00,1

"Your first problem is dissecting a sentence uttered by Trump. He speaks in word salad nonsense, no need to overthink it.",hmr0987,2025-05-01T13:52:43,1
"Yeah, I initially thought he was just buying into the stupid conspiracy theory about the tattoos until more came out showing that, no, he was basing his whole stance on those photos. I forget at times how dumb he can be.",Obvious-Gate9046,2025-05-01T12:42:41,1
