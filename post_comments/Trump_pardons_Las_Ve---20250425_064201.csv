Stealing from dead cops and getting away with it? For cosmetic surgery??  His base are just going to love that.  I wonder how long the â€˜conservativesâ€™ will be able to pretend thatâ€™s not happening.,AINonsense,2025-04-25T06:50:20,33
She offered him a cut of the loot to pardon her. He can't refuse a bribe.,CaptainStanIsTheMan,2025-04-25T06:47:49,9
"I love the Blue... I love the police and they love me. They all vote for me because I'm the only one who is looking out for them. The charges against this fine upstanding woman were all made up. I don't believe for one minute that she took $70,000 she raised to build a memorial for two police officers who had died in the line of duty, on personal bills for cosmetic procedures, her rent and her daughter's wedding. Plus, she has given me her word that she didn't do any of those things, AND she's purchased lots of $TRUMP cryptocurrency, so how could we not consider her for clemency?",TopEagle4012,2025-04-25T06:54:21,8

"Nevadan here. She's a real piece of work, basically our MTG.   She ran for (get this) state Treasurer last election but our electorate was smart enough to reject all the overt MAGAs that cycle. So she wound up as (get this) Justice of the Peace in one of our rural counties.  And is still the GOP national committeewoman.",ChloeGranola,2025-04-25T07:05:58,1
"Iâ€™ll bet a large amount of money on this news NOT appearing on a certain conservative subreddit otherwise theyâ€™d have to rationalize their dear leader pardoning someone who steals from dead cops.   We need a constitutional amendment taking away the power to pardon people or commute sentences from a single person, especially one who uses it so flagrantly to encourage criminality for his benefit and in his name.",Mrgray123,2025-04-25T07:48:52,1

"Nah   See, the cops she stole from were liberal cops   The same ones stopping the freedom rally on Jan 6, but also didnâ€™t stop antifa at the same rally from doing the damage they did   See how easy it is to make up bullshit to cover for them? Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re already going further than k am but to then reality is as malleable as it is with the reality stone",THEdoomslayer94,2025-04-25T08:43:11,2
"So the wifes of the Police officers came to me with tears in her eyes, womanly thick breasted blondes with tears in her eyes, not the trans women you see all the time in the news, and we did hold the bestest meeting in the white house with tears real American heros with tears and they said - Mr president, we know you will make this right not like Mr Biden who did an awful job on the police and never had cosmetic surgery himself, his son had a penis implant, yes they don't want you to know, on these awful awful pictures it's an implant not his actual ... You know what they say about these people, and in the Ukraine and now with China refusing our pig meat they treat us awful, awful, awful, but if Hillary hadn't sent these emails, we wouldn't be in this position.",Significant_You9481,2025-04-25T07:02:27,5
"If he actually spoke like this, it would be great. It's at least coherent. But it's lacking attacks on media, catchphrases. And Even I didn't have total success with it:  ""I LOVE the Blue. Nobody loves them more than me! And they LOVE me back! The police? Theyâ€™re all voting for Trump because Iâ€™m the ONLY one who stands with them. These charges against this wonderful, terrific woman? A TOTAL SCAM, folks. A WITCH HUNT! They say she took SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS that was supposed to go to a beautiful memorial for two GREAT, BRAVE officers who gave their lives. They died with tears in their eyes over what I've been able to do to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Did she spend it on fake nonsense, like face work, rent, and a wedding? NO! Sheâ€™s a high quality person, a real stand up lady, and she told me, to my face, Sir, I would NEVER do that. And you know what? I BELIEVE HER. Plus and this is very important. Sheâ€™s been buying LOTS of $TRUMP the most valuable crypto out there. Very smart! How could we NOT think about clemency for such a patriot? SAD what theyâ€™re doing to her! TOTAL WITCH HUNT from the FAKE NEWS LOSERS",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-25T07:17:16,3

"Nevadan also. She was originally appointed JP, then won an election in 2023. She is no longer GOP national committeewoman. She is essentially a modern-day ""carpetbagger"", moving to areas where demographics support her candidacy or running for offices that were vacated by other GOP incumbents",NotaBot8324,2025-04-27T22:43:29,1
