"I mean this should be commen sense. Don't buy a burrito on credit you can't support.   On one hand, doordash is genius for knowing how stupid the consumer is with money. On the other hand, it is evil.   But what are you gonna do? We need to educate people on personal finance so they don't sign up for dumb stuff like this. But until they learn, there will always be a market for doordash to take advantage of.",findunk,2025-05-07T21:26:25,12
">Small, everyday purchases like a meal from DoorDash are now able to be financed through eat now, pay later options â€” a practice that some experts deem ""predatory.""  Bald guy here, my bald guy advice to today's troubled youth is that **they should not be putting room service on credit just when they're sitting around bored at home.** And furthermore I would go on to say that this is not some kind of """"hidden danger,"""" people should know this on their own from instinct.  Some college kid with five figures in consumer debt (not student debt) is not a sympathetic character in the slightest, I don't even expect this hypothetical person to have much suffering ahead of them because if life held them to their failures in the first place then they would not be fucking up like this at that age.

"You have a low income, why are you buying expensive services instead of buying basics and making your own suppers?    People pay for Cables services and pay for premium channels.   They buy fast food which is not cheap anymore.   They buy stuff that they don't need that is too expensive.   Go out to movies or party.  Then they don't have any money to get to the end of the week.  How about some restraint and control of yourself?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T03:44:44,3
How about these adds about buy now pay later...   Has everyone lost their self control to budget. ... Oooohhhh I can't get to the end of the week with my paycheck. How will I pay for my luxuries...   People do not care about trying to live within their means.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T03:41:53,2
