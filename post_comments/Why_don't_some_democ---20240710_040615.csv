"Moving is expensive. Moving across state lines is more expensive. Moving across the country is VERY expensive. You have to find new housing, and in today's market, that very well could  cost more than what they're paying now. Most people don't have 100% remote jobs, so in addition to saving/paying for the move, they may also have to gain new employment at around the same time. So does their partner if they moved with one. If they have kids, the kids have to uproot their lives, start a new school, and start over with no friends.  I'm not saying your idea isn't possible, I'm saying it's highly unlikely to be done on a scale that would move the needle at all.",ibrewbeer,2024-07-10T10:54:02,31
"The obvious answer is because they have ties to where they live. Families, friends, lovers, jobs, homes. Who is going to uproot their entire life just to add one single vote to a state of millions?   Particularly if doing so *also* means living in a state governed by policies they disagree with. Who wants to intentionally subject themselves to laws they consider unjust?",Mrgoodtrips64,2024-07-10T11:20:58,27
"That requires an incredible amount of dedication. I personally do not know of any Liberal willing to sacrifice their entire structure of life to vote for Biden or anyone else in his place. Do not know of any MAGA doing the same for Trump. Not in this cycle or any other foreseeable future.   It is one thing to support a party's candidate financially, entirely another to relocate. It is unrealistic. This is why it has not happened. People relocate for many reasons, some of Blue States have moved to Red states because of other reasons such as cheaper housing and overall lower cost of living.   Some move because of incentives provided by corporations and they are not exactly lining up to support Biden.",PsychLegalMind,2024-07-10T11:56:48,6
"Simple: we don't want to live there.  For some it is the location, we like the big bustling cities we are in, and don't want to downgrade to something that is lesser, based on what we like.  For others it is state laws, and people that live there. They are more conservative, and have laws that reflect that.  And for others: it is expensive to move, and I would have to find a new (probably lesser) job.",scarr3g,2024-07-10T14:39:08,6
">Probably too late for this election cycle  Not necessarily. It’s too soon to measure but three things have been happening simultaneously   - people are moving to cities near national parks. Many such parks are in / near red states like Wyoming and Montana. It’s so bad in some places that things like restaurants are closing because local people can no longer afford to live there.  - low density development has maxed out housing in California. Such that employers can’t get local employees without paying through the nose. So have started placing satellite offices (aka engineering centers) in other cities and states.  - Covid has accelerated both effects by normalizing wfh, across a range of industries",ElectronGuru,2024-07-10T11:03:30,4

">It seems like a relatively simple solution.     On an individual level nothing about that is simple.  Literally no one is going to give up their job, proximity to family and friends, 3% mortgage rate, school system, etc. to make the presidential election one vote closer.      Young people are moving away from some of the blue coastal states to others you mention for more affordable housing.  It’s possible those trends could weaken the Republican electoral college advantage over time, but I wouldn’t consider it a given by any means.",freedraw,2024-07-10T14:25:43,2

"The major motivating factor is that we're not in a recession. During financial hard times,  people will uproot to find work. During employment stability? Not so much, especially if they have a decent paying position.  Maybe semi-skilled labor would make the move, but compare the rate of pay in California or New York with the same job in those red states. Average pay for a carpenter in New York? $35.64. Wisconsin? $23.44. Would **YOU** want to take such a cut?",Swiggy1957,2024-07-11T00:00:08,2
"I think a lot of the answers here are overcomplicating things. These new residents don’t have to stay in their new state forever. They don’t even have to physically be there. They just have to have an address in the new state to be able to vote.   For example, say I live in NY. I can coordinate with someone online to get a new address from someone who lives in Wisconsin. I register to vote in Wisconsin.   Or on a bigger scale, a donor can buy or rent a house somewhere like in Atlanta. They can give out their address (maybe a PO box) so that others can use it. They register to vote in Georgia",cracksilog,2024-07-11T14:46:04,2
"It would be less of a burden to just get more states to adopt the national popular vote compact.  Blue voters are moving to AZ, GA & TX.  Just look at the electoral gains in AZ by democrats.  They won the the US senate seats, had the SoS and then she won the governorship, they are 2 or 3 seats short of taking both state chambers.    Once those 3 move to the blue column the map for GOP is rather hard.  The real problem for democrats will be the US senate.",captain-burrito,2024-07-17T12:44:16,2

"I think because there hasn’t been a movement to do it. It needs an organizer. Like, if you get 100k people to commit, we all move there in solidarity.   But then the other side would do the same thing.  I don’t think anything is more important than who runs the country. It’s worth it. If only someone would organize it. ",basilpurpletulip,2024-11-04T17:39:07,1
"I’m thinking democrats living in red states should move to blue states where their votes count for something. The higher the population of the blue states, the more electoral college votes will be assigned for the win and the opposite will happen to the then lesser populated red states.  This is what I plan on doing going forward as my vote didn’t matter in the red state I currently live in, instead it gave more power to republicans for this election.",Financial-Cloud-4060,2024-11-06T04:58:14,1
"i think this is something liberal billionaires who employ thousands of ppl and have the resources to create more employment opportunities should seriously look into.   most cities in even red states are blue. ppl with the money to invest could bring jobs AND build housing for new employees in these cities. surely there are a few thousand ppl working in tech who love the outdoors and would love to move to montana, for instance — missoula is such a gem! not everyone will vote democrat, but many will. local elections are also important. this would make democrats more competitive in house races in small states. eventually also in the senate and electoral college.  going back to montana, 100k dem voters would make the state reliably blue.   renewable energy companies should also think about this and be strategic about the political power that the location of their workforce affords them.   create jobs, build housing, and they will come.   coincidentally, there’s less red tape in red and purple states to open business AND build housing. time to placate those swing voters’ economic anxieties — and bring in some new moderate/liberal/progressive neighbors.  research centers, tech hubs, green jobs in manufacturing, climate-friendly housing development, even a few hippie communes here and there, they would all help.",Key_Pair_3290,2024-11-07T05:46:26,1

"I'm not saying it would be easy, or that it's likely. But it's been done for explicitly political purposes in the past. It is something more feasible than eliminating the electoral college or two senators per state or adding more states. It means We The People have agency over our political lives and country's future. I guess my post was poorly worded, because I know the excuses why it doesn't happen. I mainly was asking the question to remind people that it's an option. We aren't helpless and our system is a system of self-government. Now, I know that is all overly simiplistic, but I'm a simple guy.",WharfRatigan,2024-09-15T14:20:16,1

"Yeah so stay in your big bustling cities while the country crumbles. The abolitionists in the 1850s probably preferred Boston over bumfuck, Kansas too. Confict between them and the pro-slavery people led to the start the Civil War. I'm sure most people preferred peace over war too. But I'm grateful they were better people than most today, and we don't have slavery anywhere, and no legacy of slavery in ""western"" states like Kansas and Nebraska.

"I like your thinking and mostly agree too, but I'm afraid that could be toeing the line of voter fraud. But I do like it! Thank you for your comment. I think  most comments are addressing the question and providing what I'd asked for, excuses why people are too afraid or too lazy to vote with their feet to shape the nation's future. They don't want think about how we have agency over the country's system of self-government, we are the architects of our lives, and not some extras on set of a simulation (well not sure about that, but I sure as hell am a main character, or at least a comic relief side role, not an extra).

"How do you propose doing this? Constitutional amendment(s)? Yeah right, good luck. We have added like just seventeen amendments since ratification, outside of the initial Bill of Rights, and two were related to alcohol prohibition and repeal. And no amendments since 1991 or so. How else do you do it? Completely overhauling the Constitution and called for a new constitutional convention to draft a new one and adopt an entirely new system? LOL. Now, Thomas Jefferson had said something about how the system did need revisited or revised or completely redone by every generation or every 25 years or so, but it's not going to happen.  Moving to make states majority blue solves the Senate problem too. It wouldn't have to be that every liberal move from Williamsburg or Topanga Canyon, and it wouldn't even have to be forever. People move, gain the political power to add the desired constitutional amendment(s), or an entirely new constitutional system, and then move back to their safe spaces.",WharfRatigan,2024-09-15T14:35:44,1

"You must not have very competent reading comprehension skills. And must not know American history. Abolitionists from the east cost did it in the 1850s, moving to the Kansas-Nebraska territories to vote against the expansion of slavery westward after the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for the issue to be decided by popular sovereignty. All y'all's excuses were factors in the 1850s too, but I'd argue they were probably more daunting and and moving across the country was certainly a much more dangerous prospect. Keep making excuses. Stay in your little liberal bubbles and stay afraid, while the Republicans control the Senate, and often the House, and have a good shot at getting the Whitehouse, and the entire country crumbles.

"Has it not led to AZ getting bluer, GA & TX getting less red?  Blue voters are spilling out of the urban core and into surrounding suburbs which will also help legislative elections.  Even when GOP in TX drew new maps they had to create many more safe blue districts and just shore up their battleground districts.  NC seems stable. FL has gotten more red, that might be a good thing as that soaks up more excess red votes while not yielding more US senate power.  The problem for dems will be the senate in the future as they could be a supermajority in voters but concentrate in a minority of states.",captain-burrito,2024-07-17T12:37:37,1
"Not really.   Let's compare living wages:  To live in the lowest COL city in New York State, you would be in Rochester, with a living wage¹ of $21.57/hr. The minimum wage there is $16.00.   Compare this to the lowest COL is Antigo, Wisconsin. The living wage¹ $19.14/hr. The minimum wage is $7.25/hr.  Minimum wage, which is often a starting wage, regardless of experience, is approximately² 74% of the Rochester Living Wage.   The minimum wage in Wisconsin is approximately² 38% of the living wage.  Minimum wage is important when Jobhunting because that is how local wages are determined.   An unskilled worker in Rochester stands a better chance at finding work with wages that they at least survive on. Yes, they may have to wear the same sets of underwear another year, but they can survive. Also, the social safety net will be better.   The gap between minimum wage and living wage in Wisconsin is too big. Believe me, employers will pay the lowest wages that they can. You'd be lucky of you were offered ½ the living wage.  # **Notes:**  1: Per the [**MIT Living Wage Calculator**](http://livingwage.mit.com). This is for a single person with zero dependents. This calculates food, shelter, transportation, and the general cost of living to determine what you need to earn.
