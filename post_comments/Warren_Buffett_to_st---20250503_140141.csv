Leftists hate greedy billionaires but Buffet and Soros get a pass.  Almost like hypocrisy.,chances906,2025-05-03T14:16:26,9

"Iâ€™ve followed Buffett for decades.  Buffett isnâ€™t in the same galaxy as Soros.  It helps Buffett is an admitted cheap skate who has lived a dull and  decent existence.  Politically heâ€™s  Dem, but not deeply.  Heâ€™s said before he has and would still vote Republican without issue if they were the best candidate to do what is needed at a particular time in history.    Also worth noting - although he wouldnâ€™t endorse Trump - he also said he couldnâ€™t and wouldnâ€™t endorse Kamala.  I think largely because heâ€™s an old school liberal, not one who was an old school liberal and let the DNC and the media scold them into submission - and thus becoming leftist assholes.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T15:46:18,13
I understand completely. The left is moving to the extreme left. The right is as left as Bill Clinton used to be.   Conservatives never moved.   Just because he (Buffet) seems reasonable in a cesspool doesn't mean he is reasonable.  People like Trump aren't an answer. They are a bandage to a gaping wound.   Let's not forget. We are being allowed a chance to correct mistakes. I am a catholic but not a very good one. I don't go to church often. Truth is. I probably can't even call myself catholic anymore.   But I never once doubted God or my faith in humanity. I believe we are on a precipice. We start regrouping as a family and community or we lose.  I don't think the devil will show himself. He doesn't have to. AI and tech will do it for him.   Republicans aren't a solution. They are simply the best we have. For now.,chances906,2025-05-03T16:40:43,-2
