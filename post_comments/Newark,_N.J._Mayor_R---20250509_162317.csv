">“Fire officials can go inside a building at any time they want to do any inspections, and they’re not allowing them in. Fire officials were here, code officials were here yesterday, and they wouldn’t let us in. And now I am here today.” Baraka said  Wow! They're putting fire department personnel in harms way not only at this facility, but all buildings in its vicinity. Who do they expect to be responding to incidents at these locations?? Certainly not Stephen Miller, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Signal Pete, and Kristi Noem!   Building in Mayor's city need to be properly inspected by chief before they open! No federal land and they need the right permits to operate from Newark and Mayor!",postsshortcomments,2025-05-09T16:43:06,8
