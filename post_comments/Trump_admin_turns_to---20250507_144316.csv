">*The Trump administration plans to publish news from One America News Network – a pro-Trump, far-right outlet known for peddling conspiracy theories – on the Voice of America and other U.S.-run media.*  >*The agreement comes as Voice of America’s own future is in serious doubt. It has a skeleton crew of senior staff amid a court battle over severe cuts ordered in March by President Donald Trump, who called the agency “anti-Trump” and “radical” in* [*an executive order ordering the overhaul*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/the-voice-of-radical-america/)*. The agency’s news website has not been updated since March 15.*  >*Kari Lake, a Trump appointee who oversees VOA’s parent company, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the partnership with OANN as an “enormous benefit to the American taxpayer” in* [*an X post Tuesday night*](https://x.com/KariLake/status/1919946331818205610)*.*  >*One America News Network, which has spread conspiracy theories about* [*Covid-19*](https://www.axios.com/2020/11/24/youtube-temporarily-suspends-demonetizes-oann)*,* [*the 2020 presidential election*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/business/media/dominion-newsmax-one-america-lawsuit.html) *and* [*the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection*](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/)*, will provide a free news and video feed for use by VOA around the world as well as the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and Radio Martí, which are U.S.-led broadcasts into Cuba.*  >    >*The federally funded VOA, established in 1942 to combat Nazi disinformation, has been key in fighting authoritarian regimes across the globe. And now, for the first time across 15 presidential administrations, its mission is in question.*  >*David Seide, the lead attorney in a lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of VOA employees, and senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, said the agreement announced by Lake is likely illegal because it violates the statutory obligation established by Congress, requiring a firewall between management and editorial employees.*  >*VOA’s contracts with wire services like The Associated Press and Reuters were canceled in March under an executive order from Trump. Now, OANN will effectively serve in that capacity for audiences across the globe.*  >",mom0nga,2025-05-07T22:36:09,1
"“The Trump administration plans to publish news…”  The first 7 words should send a chill down your spine. It’s fascism. Not that there haven’t been other indicators, but this is page 1 of the fascist playbook. Government does not publish news. Period!",theEndIsNigh_2025,2025-05-08T05:33:03,1
