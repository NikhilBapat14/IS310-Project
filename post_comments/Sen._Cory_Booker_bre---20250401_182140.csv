"I would look at the overall picture here. Cory Booker's speech not only is a huge boost to Democrat morale, but it also gives the Democrats a strong leader to rally behind for 2028. That's something that has been sorely lacking since Obama.  Additionally, yesterday the Democrats won the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat the Elon was so worried about and MASSIVELY outperformed expectations in Florida. Yes, they lost, but they were never expected to win.  All of this points to a momentum swing that is needed at this point in history.",Amenian,2025-04-02T11:25:19,1

I'd rather see concrete direct action like what happened in Wisconsin.
