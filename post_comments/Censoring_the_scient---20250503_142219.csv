"I'm a member of the AAAS so I get reports on this every week in our flagship journal _Science_.    Trump is absolutely demolishing the entire American science establishment.          Major research and experiments are being stopped right in the middle, wasting vast amounts of money and resources.  Promising treatments for a whole bunch of different diseases have been halted.    Thousands upon thousands of scientific careers have been ended, or stopped before they even begin because postdocs don't have research projects to work on. Labs are being shut down, top researchers are being turned away at the border, foreign scientists are afraid to come here to attend scientific conferences or to advance their education, the best and the brightest US scientists are leaving for greener pastures in other countries, and America's reputation for scientific research has been utterly ruined.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:28:52,18
Everytime an R gets in they always cut funding for basic science. Most Rs seem to hate science in general because it enables a worldview that allows one to accurately comprehend things and move forward successfully in the world without religion.,Ok_Breakfast4482,2025-05-03T14:59:58,9

"When a party's base is composed of people who reject evolution, believe our planet is only thousands of years old, and is convinced kids are pissing and shitting in litter boxes and getting their peepees amputated, it makes it easier to destroy science. Tons of evangelical leaders like John Hagee and Mike Johnson's buddies at the Family Research Council believe they're being suppressed and censored for their beliefs because they just can't accept that that their views are just that fucking stupid.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-03T16:26:39,4
"Some useful points from this editorial:  >Over the last two weeks, in response to Executive Order 14035, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has discontinued funding for research on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as support for researchers from marginalized backgrounds. Executive Order 14168 ordered the NSF (and other federal agencies) to discontinue any research that focused on women, women in STEM, gender variation, and transsexual or transgender populations—and, oddly, transgenic mice. > >Then, another round of cancellations targeted research on misinformation and disinformation, a subject (among others) that Republican Senator Ted Cruz views as advancing neo-Marxist perspectives and class warfare. > >... > >The NSF is a “pass through agency”—most of its annual budget (around $9 billion) passes through the agency and is returned to American communities in the form of science grants (80 percent of the budget) and STEM education (13 percent). The NSF manages these programs via a staff that is packed full of expert scientists in physics, psychology, chemistry, geosciences, engineering, sociology, and other fields. These scientists and the administrative staff (1,700 employees, who account for around 5 percent of its budget) organize complex peer-review panels that assess and distribute funding to cutting-edge science. > >In normal times, presidents may shift the NSF’s funding priorities—this is their prerogative. This process is political. It always has been. It always will be. Elected officials (both presidents and Congress) have agendas and interests and want to bring federal dollars to their constituents. Additionally, there are national priorities—pandemic response, supercomputing needs, nanotechnology breakthroughs, space exploration goals, demands for microchip technologies, and artificial intelligence advancements. > >Presidential agendas are meant to “steer the ship” by working with Congress to develop annual budgets, set appropriations and earmarks, and focus on specific regions (e.g., EPSCoR), topics, or facilities (e.g., federal labs). > >While shifting priorities is normal, cancellation of previously funded research projects is NOT normal. Unilaterally banning funding for specific types of research (climate science, misinformation, research on minoritized groups) is not normal. > >It’s anti-scientific, allowing politics rather than expertise to determine which research is most competitive. Canceling research grants because they threaten the current regime’s political agenda is a violation of the NSF’s duty to honor contracts and ethically manage the funds appropriated by the US Congress. This is a threat not just to individual scientists and universities, but to the trust and norms that underpin our scientific enterprise. It’s an attempt to terrorize researchers with the fear that their funding may be next and to create backlash against science and expertise (another important area of NSF-funded research that has also been canceled). > >... > >The American scientific enterprise has been a world leader, and federal funding of science is a key driver of this success. For the last 100 years, students, scientists, and entrepreneurs from around the world have flocked to the US to advance science and innovation. Public investments in science have produced economic health and prosperity for all Americans and advanced our national security through innovation and soft diplomacy. > >... > >All Americans who benefit from the outcomes of publicly funded science—GPS and touch screens on your phone, Google, the Internet, weather data on an app, MRI, kidney exchanges, CRISPR, 3D printing, tiny hearing aids, bluetooth, broadband, robotics at the high school, electric cars, suspension bridges, PCR tests, AlphaFold and other AI tools, Doppler radar, barcodes, reverse auctions, and far, far more—should be alarmed and taking action. > >Here are some ideas of what you can do: > >1.    Demand that Congress restore previous appropriations, 5Calls >2.    Advocate through any professional associations you’re a member of >3.    Join science action groups (Science for the People, Union of Concerned Scientists, American Association for the Advancement of Science) >4.    Talk to university funders, leadership, and alumni about the value of publicly funded science >5.    Educate the public (including friends, family, and neighbors) about the value of science and the role of federally funded research >6.    Write an op-ed or public outreach materials through your employer >7.    Support federal employees >8.    If you’re a scientist, say yes to media & public engagement requests >9.    Attend local meetings: city council, library board, town halls >10.    Attend a protest >11.    Get offline and get active, in-person > >There is a lot going on in the political environment right now, making it easy to get caught up in the implications cuts have on individual research projects or to be reassured by things that haven’t been targeted yet. But the threat looms large, for all US science. The US, through agencies like the NSF, has built a world-class scientific enterprise founded on the belief that taxpayer investments in basic science can and do produce valuable economic and social outcomes for all of us. Censoring research and canceling misinformation grants is a small step in what is already a larger battle to defend our world-class scientific enterprise. It is up to all of us to act now.  It's pretty clear that these cuts are purely political in nature, designed to appeal to the hardcore base of the republican party, and designed by people who have no understanding of the actual research or its importance (likely a search for keywords or substrings they don't like and that's it). This will be damaging not just in the immediate future but likely for generations as researchers leave and new researchers look elsewhere for opportunities to do this kind of critical research with less political interference.   Members of the public who care about these issues should be raising their voices. Worth perusing the article for links to relevant resources if interested and concerned.  edit: formatting",Hrmbee,2025-05-03T14:33:12,3

"*“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”*  -Carl Sagan *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark* (1995)",sharp11flat13,2025-05-04T05:34:47,1
