"A fat black woman in a t-shirt is the image that NYC wants to celebrate? It's just hilarious. Net negative contribution to society, yet so many liberals just can't wait to bend the knee to them. I truly don't understand 😂",California-Cowgirl,2025-05-07T20:53:36,377
Disgusting. Is nothing sacred? Give it a few years and elements of the left will be calling for Mt. Vernon to be bulldozed into the Potomac.,SouthernNumismatist,2025-05-07T20:18:20,149

"Hopefully, it will get removed, and TJ will go back in his rightful place. Trump signed an EO to review and restore improperly removed statues over the last 5 or so years. That would cause one huge collective ""REEEEEEEE"" from the left, but I'm here for it. I'm sure it would cause me as much joy in seeing it torn down as it did for the marxists tearing down TJ, but I'll remain on the right side of history, thank you very much.",SingleStak9,2025-05-07T23:58:51,65
"This is asinine, and the women as depicted is almost beyond overweight, and low key obese.   Worth noting this isn’t permanent, it’s a temporary display running for like 2 months.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T21:09:46,52

Huh? They removed Thomas Jefferson from city hall and then erected a different statue in times sq? I'm not following what the connection is. City Hall and times sq are not close to each other at all.   That's not to say that removing Thomas Jefferson was good - it is completely unAmerican to do so. And idgaf about the fat black lady. There's weirder stuff on times sq. I'm just not following how the two events are at all related. It's like the author doesnt live in NYC and is publishing random stuff.,findunk,2025-05-07T21:29:07,32

Idk they could have chosen from the long ass list of influential black figures of history but nope just some random woman. I get some hate for jefferson but this isn't a suitable replacement. It's embarrassing if anything.,Katzchen12,2025-05-07T21:16:21,137
IMO net negative is not accurate though there are certainly some significant problem areas. Bigger issue is that they took down a founding father for a seemingly random portrayal of a fictional woman. Like why? How could this be considered a valuable exchange to anyone? How is removing a founding father a good thing? How does this help or promote black women? It’s (likely white) virtue signaling at its worst.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-07T22:01:38,41

"What's confusing? It shows the insane racist priorities of the left. They think a fat lady in an ill fitting t-shirt is good because she's black, and that Thomas Jefferson is evil because he's white. It's not complicated.",Hrendo,2025-05-07T23:30:04,31

Nahhh that would mean they did anything wrong and thats not a very stalinist and by extension marxist thing.,Katzchen12,2025-05-07T23:41:08,37
