"It's great to see MAGA breakdown because the entire world is NOT as hateful as they are.

Is that another way to spell FENTANYL OVERDOSE? MARXIST POPE!”  It's such a welcome surprise, including the new Pope's choice of name.  Apparently, Pope Leo XIII was very supportive of the labor movement at the turn of the 20th century.  Hopefully, this relatively young (69) Pope will be able to make a difference--and be a global counterweight to the hatred embodied in Trumpism.",FIlm2024,2025-05-08T17:26:50,19
"Trump supporters thrive on outrage and victimhood. Their whole platform and ideology is centered around their culture wars and their petty grievances. Their politics and religion are inseparable and form the basis of their identities.   > ...conservative pundits and Trump loyalists fumed over the “WOKE MARXIST POPE” and complained that he is “worse than Francis,” referencing the previous pontiff known for his progressive values.  > “Sorry, Catholics. This new Pope is an open borders globalist. He will be pushing for abortion soon. This isn’t a guess. You can scroll his X account and see what he’s been up to,” alt-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich griped on X.  > Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt grumbled that this “Pope better not be woke.”   > Steve Bannon warned about Prevost’s views, claiming that he would be a poor choice for the MAGA movement.   > “I do think one of the dark horses — and unfortunately one of the most progressive — is Cardinal Prevost... he's certainly on the shortlist,”   See how MAGA thinks the world revolves around them and that it's necessary for the Pope to support *their* worldview, to align his own interests with *theirs*? That it's somehow the Pope's duty to ingratiate himself with Trump and his followers?  The Pope is a *global* leader, but these MAGA fanatics are under the impression that—especially as an American—he's obligated to strictly serve them and their beliefs.   And within mere hours of the official announcement, Trump supporters were already resorting to politicizing the situation—as they typically do—spamming social media with politically charged, clickbait posts that contained some of their favorite buzzwords and epithets.   Yes, it didn't take long for Trump supporters to use the opportunity to broadcast their outrage and bitterness to the world, all while insisting that this situation is just another example of *them* being persecuted by their ever-nebulous, woke, globalist overlords.  And what really illustrates the hypocrisy of the religious right, is how they responded to this former Tweet from Provest:   > “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” Prevost tweeted earlier this year, referencing comments the vice president made about Christians needing to “prioritize” their love.   Apparently, following the teachings of Jesus Christ is ""woke."" Messages of unconditional love are ""woke.""   Oof, just wait until conservatives learn what the Bible has to say about treating foreigners...  This is a glaring example of how terms like ""woke"" and ""Marxist"" have become blanket, superficial catchwords that conservatives use to communicate things like, ""I vehemently disagree with you because you don't share the same views towards certain vulnerable groups as I do,"" or because ""you don't subscribe to the same dogma as me,"" ""you don't identity with the same things I do,"" ""you don't believe in a social order that preserves a white, Christian hegemony,"" ""you don't prioritize certain groups over others.""  And oh no! The Pope was critical of JD Vance and Trump! Must mean he's a globalist, deep state puppet whose sole objective is to tyrannize the MAGA population.  > ...social media personality Joey Mannarino groused that “the new Pope has recently attacked JD Vance, shown solidarity with Kilmar Abrego-Garcia and begged Trump to open the borders like Biden had them,” adding that “this guy is worse than Francis.”  > In a separate tweet, he went even further, calling him a “liberal piece of s***” and insisting that “we’re f***ed.” Mannarino’s spouse Ada Lluch, who credits Trump for the couple getting married (they’ve since separated), complained that the “new pope suffers from the woke mind virus.”  > “In case you're wondering why they picked an American to be a Pope for the first time in history,” MAGA influencer Vince Langman, sharing a 2015 tweet of Prevost criticizing Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, whined. “He's a WOKE Never Trumper liberal. That's why!”  See here again, they are defined by who is victimizing them, it forms the foundation of their identity. They cannot separate their politics from their persona.  > [Laura] Loomer lamented about the “WOKE MARXIST POPE” and claimed he “is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis,” adding that it’s “GROSS” that he is now in charge of the Vatican.  > “The new Pope once retweeted a post about how we need to keep praying for career criminal & drug addict George Floyd,” she raged. “The tweet said, ‘May all hatred, violence and prejudice be eradicated.’ What prejudice? Is that another way to spell FENTANYL OVERDOSE? MARXIST POPE!”  Another said:  > ""They chose a globalist and woke Pope from the West ON PURPOSE” to criticize the president...  Even the Pizzagate conspiracy theorist himself—Jack Posobiec—chimed in, appearing ""visibly irate"" in response to Provest's tweets:   > “We need to see from the jump, from the absolute jump, whether or not Pope Leo is interested in working with President Trump or — as we can see from his Twitter feed — working against him,” he said during the broadcast of his Real America’s Voice show.""  Ahh yes, it's not just the obligation, but the purpose of the new Pope to carry out the wishes of Trump and his followers.  It's as if they feel entitled to it, and therefore entitled to make demands, demands of the Pope, demands of anyone...  It's just more of the same. More catchwords and pejoratives, more of the same MAGA idiolect, more whining, more grievances, more outrage.  They believe that they are fighting in an endless war between them vs the other; the enemy; all the evils of the world.   There's always a conspiracy theory or plot—conjured up by some vague, enigmatic threat—to undermine them and their beliefs, their cause, their culture, their political leaders. They must always be at the center of some grand machination, some oppressive scheme concocted by this shadowy and nefarious authority that routinely has it out for them.

Then come, follow me.”  “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.”   “He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing.

"""Woke"" originated within the black community as a word for indicating you're ""awake"" about the existence of systemic racism. It was used for years. Powerful word. Important word. The far-right was compelled to take that power away. So what did they do? They adopted it into their lexicon. It doesn't carry the original meaning. ""Woke"" to them is some kind of warped political correctness where non-whites are given special consideration that the white Republicans believe to be inherently unfair to whites... thus to be reviled.  I'm so damned sick of the media not keeping things framed properly. Republicans flood the narratives so much, that they coerce these weak journalists into adopting the Republican definition of ""woke."" It's maddening.  Another alternative they often use now is ""DEI."" Diversity, Equity, Inclusion. Yes, diversity... that there should be consideration given such that we don't end up with workforces, student bodies, and management all white. Equity, that people should be treated equally regardless of skin color or gender. Inclusion, that there shouldn't be people excluded because of their skin color or gender. These are good, sound principles to the objective, emotionally intelligent person. But to the far-right Republicans? It's a dreaded travesty that must be abolished.  Essentially Republicans want:  Homogeneity -- all white, where applicable. And all non-white elsewhere.  Inequality -- white people get preference, the rest do not.  Separation -- if whites want purity, they get it; non-whites must comply.  In our faces, this is what they're demanding. It's so fucked up and the antithesis that we've grown up to accept and believe. This is precisely what the Confederates wanted. And it's now what the 21st century Republicans want. They are racists, misogynists, and fascists. And no, just because there's a woman heading the DOJ and an American-Ugandan (of Indian descent) heading up the FBI doesn't check any real boxes. These people are useful tools, total sycophants for Trump, who have already betrayed the oaths they took before assuming office. If they weren't diehard right-wingers they'd be barred from holding any positions as part of the anti-DEI policy of Trump's administration.",cytherian,2025-05-08T17:14:44,4

The Vatican has rarely been on the cutting edge of any moral or ethical issue, ever.  No Pope ever made a full throated condemnation of the institution of slavery until well after the US civil war.  Barely a peep about the mass slaughter of civilians, INCLUDING CATHOLICS, in the Nazi controlled territories of Europe.

Given what appears to be some gathering strength within conservative Catholicism, it will be interesting to see what happens the first time he speaks out against a Trump policy.

"There is a stream of US conservatives who grew up with Pope John Paul II as an extremely influential ally on some of the most salient issues for them, globally and domestically.   As the culture wars came to a head in the English-speaking West on issues like gay marriage and abortion, the Church’s positions aligned very closely with mainstream conservatives. Meanwhile John Paul II was an extremely important diplomatic figure in his opposition to the Soviet Union.   In a fairly conservative era, the issues of the time aligned in such a way that the Catholic Church and US conservative movement had a lot of overlap.   I think many non-Catholic conservatives came to associate the Church through those issues alone and are now surprised to see that those are often the *only* positions where they align with the Church.  Its position on migrant rights, skepticism toward free market capitalism, and considerably progressive views on race and racism…these are nothing new. They were espoused even by the likes of JP2 - it’s just that those were overshadowed by other issues of the time. Even a *very* conservative Pope would hold those views.   These are people trying to force a 2000-year-old, universal institution into an EXTREMELY narrow political framework. To be frank: these are not very intelligent people.",CobblePots95,2025-05-09T08:14:04,2

Not everybody can agree with every policy that Trump's administration is pursuing because everybody has their own opinion and different fundamental beliefs.  It doesn't mean that the person is WOKE or MARXIST.   That's how the Trump administration is plunging the country into a more divided and polarised nation.   He has once claimed that Harris has never worked at McDonald's, but he's got literally zero evidence to back up those assertions.

But have obviously chosen not to. All the glaring issues with Catholicism aside, a pick like this opens up the doors to an unknown future. A man in that position with no rules, no accountability, and every resource of the catholic church at his disposal, it can take any given twist and turn and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.

"Ive come to realize that it actually a bit more complex than that. Its bit like cult think where there are ""good"" people and ""bad"" people. Its VERY literal. They generally see themselves as good people because they themselves are ""good"". They care for their families, work hard, are polite to other people- sometimes they're nice to even ""bad"" people. They can generally determine who is ""Good"" by how conformist to their own world view someone is. Thats why immigrants who don't assimilate or share their religion are ""bad' or ""dangerous"". Leftists dont agree with them who ""bad"" and ""good"" people are so they're misguided, confused, stupid, or worst of all - actively ""Bad"" and so whatever the outsiders do must be bad even if it does end up being beneficial. It all depends who is in the cult, who the leader or leaders say are bad and who is good- no matter what bad things the ""Good"" people have done- they must have done it for a ""Good"" reason because they're good.

Generally a supporter of democratic governance however in practice in a way in which the political opposition is severely weakened and the communist party is the main political force. Generally supporting the working class and the global south against the scourge of imperialism.   Liberal - roots in anti-monarchism, supports personal freedom (e.g. John Stuart Mills), enlightenment thinking, private (enterprise) property, expanding capitalism, supports secularism, not state atheism. Generally a supporter of democratic or republic governance.   The Papcy - a Christian theocratic government in which its ruler, the Pope, seen as the vicar of Jesus Christ whose legitimacy is traced to the Saint Peter, is infallible when speaking ex cathedra. Previous popes starting with Leo XIII have spoken out against communism and capitalism, precedent continued with Saint Pope John Paul II and up until the previous Pope Francis.   Yes these ideas and modes of government definitely make the most sense together and are completely compatible lol. Absolutely no contradictions. Yes we have a Marxist Liberal Pope who believes in the democratically elected unitary communist party of the vicar of Christ King and Supreme Pontiff of the Holy See who will abolish and reinstate private property and ensure the working class are atheists and Catholics. This makes too much sense. ",Electronic_Topic1958,2025-05-08T20:02:18,2

"They sucked 20 years ago too. Are you old enough to remember? That was peak Iraq war era GWB administration. They invaded Iraq based on false intel they knew was false. They intentionally lied to us and the world so W could have his war. Colin Powell lied through his fucking teeth to the world at the UN. I vividly remember watching that speech. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died. Then it became clear the situation was a clusterfuck with no solution and we went invaded on lies and never should have in the first place, so John Kerry ran on a campaign that it was a mistake to go in and we need an exit plan. He was relentlessly attacked and mocked for it.   This was still relatively soon after 9/11. American people (guess which ones) were attacking Muslims, Hindus, and even Sikhs in the streets because they looked like the 9/11 terrorists. These are the same Trump lovers voting for the Maga party today.   This was the era of 'you're either with us or against us.' The Bush era of Jack Bauer diplomacy. Preemptive first strikes and illegal wars of aggression. They relentlessly mocked and alienated France too, one of our strongest allies, for rightfully calling us idiots about Iraq. 'Mission Accomplished.' Free speech zones. The Patriot Act and warrantless wiretapping of hundreds of millions of Americans. Guantanamo Bay. Fucking torture!  National debt doubled under Bush from about $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Largely from his permanent tax cuts giving capital gains enormously beneficial treatment, stimulus spending, and war spending.   The Great Recession happened under his watch at the tail end of eight years of Republican rule. That's an extremely complex subject and the result of many many institutions failing (watch the big short, highly accurate look at these failures). But still, there were opportunities to see it and prevent it.   So I'm sorry but you gotta ditch those rose colored glasses that make you think the old school republican party of 20 years ago was the slightest bit honorable, reasonable, respectable, and financially responsible.",Papayaslice636,2025-05-08T19:57:19,3

Matt Gaetz was one of those “concerned voters” and the rest were GOP aides.  We really need to stop romanticizing some recent-past Republican Party.

"Hypothetical Traits of a ""Fascist Marxist"": Authoritarian Structure with Revolutionary Rhetoric: A single-party state or strong leader (fascist trait) claiming to represent the ""working class"" (Marxist rhetoric). Use of Marxist class struggle language to justify authoritarian rule, but without genuine intent to dissolve the state or empower the proletariat.  Nationalist Socialism: A focus on national identity (fascist) over international proletarian unity (Marxist), creating a ""socialism in one country"" model that prioritizes the nation’s workers over global class solidarity. State-controlled economy with Marxist-inspired collective ownership, but serving nationalist goals, like Mussolini’s corporatism with a Marxist veneer.  Militarized Class Narrative: Propaganda blending fascist militarism with Marxist class warfare, portraying the nation’s workers as a heroic force fighting ""foreign capitalists"" or ""traitorous elites."" A cult of personality around a leader presented as both a nationalist savior (fascist) and a champion of the proletariat (Marxist).  Suppression of Dissent: Fascist-style repression of opposition, including independent Marxist or socialist movements, under the guise of protecting the ""revolution."" Unions and worker organizations exist but are state-controlled, unlike Marxism’s emphasis on grassroots proletarian power.  Hierarchical Egalitarianism: Rhetorical commitment to equality (Marxist), but in practice, a rigid hierarchy (fascist) where party elites or loyalists dominate, and class distinctions persist under nationalist pretexts.  Traditionalism (fascist) might clash with Marxist social progressivism, leading to selective cultural policies (e.g., promoting ""national"" worker culture). Historical Analogues: No regime has been explicitly ""fascist Marxist,"" but some historical movements or leaders have borrowed elements from both, creating hybrid ideologies:  Stalinism: While rooted in Marxism-Leninism, Stalin’s regime adopted nationalist and authoritarian traits, like the ""Great Patriotic War"" rhetoric and state-controlled economy, resembling fascist centralization in practice, though it lacked fascism’s overt traditionalism or private enterprise collaboration. Strasserism: A fringe Nazi faction in 1930s Germany, led by Gregor and Otto Strasser, emphasized anti-capitalist, worker-focused policies with nationalist zeal, but was still firmly fascist and rejected Marxist internationalism. It was purged by Hitler.  Peronism in Argentina: Juan Perón’s 1940s-50s regime mixed nationalist authoritarianism with pro-worker policies, appealing to the working class while maintaining state control and suppressing dissent, though it wasn’t explicitly Marxist.  Why It Wouldn’t Work: Ideological Conflict: Fascism’s nationalism and hierarchy clash with Marxism’s internationalism and egalitarianism. A regime trying to merge them would alienate purists on both sides. Practical Instability: Marxist calls for revolution and statelessness undermine fascist demands for permanent state power. Workers empowered by Marxist rhetoric might resist fascist control. External Opposition: Such a regime would struggle to gain allies, as it would be distrusted by both capitalist nations (opposed to Marxism) and socialist movements (opposed to fascism).  Conclusion: A ""fascist Marxist"" would likely resemble an authoritarian, nationalist regime using Marxist rhetoric to justify state control and worker loyalty, but it would lean more toward fascism in practice, as Marxism’s stateless, egalitarian goals are incompatible with fascist structure. It would be a populist, propagandistic system, suppressing dissent while promoting a contradictory vision of ""national revolution."" Historically, attempts at such blends (e.g., Stalin’s nationalism or Strasserism) either abandoned core Marxist principles or were sidelined by purer fascist or Marxist movements.

"In the Old Testament, ""Satan"" is just a noun/verb that is used mostly to describe servants of God sent by him on tasks. There are a few instances of it being used ominously or vaguely, but we don't know the authorial intent. In the New Testament, the Devil, Satan, is mostly an allegory for the Roman Emperor and/or Rome in general. NT reads largely like subversive political literature from people occupied by Rome.  616 is ""Caesar Nero."" 666 is ""Caesar Neron"", with the added n being a common linguistic flourish at the time. Idr what the Jewish system was called for assigning letters/names to numerical values. But yeah, ""the Devil, Satan,"" ws just Nero, whom the Christian Jews considered the reincarnation of Domitian, who was particularly brutal in oppressing Jewish people.

He peeled back all the propaganda to get to the core grievances  these two grandmas had, and it turned out, they had their retirements stolen by the ruling class, they were getting priced out of being able to go grocery shopping, and they could barely make ends meet, some of their friends had to get jobs, when they all should have been happily retired and enjoying the ends of their lives.  Their underlying (and driving) concerns are real and valid. The situations that radicalized them are legitimate. But once radicalize by their situations, they were vulnerable.  The problem is, MAGA got to them first. When they were vulnerable, MAGA made them feel heard and valid, and made them feel like they had a revolutionary movement to fight against inflation and to get their retirements back. A huuge driving factor for Trump’s elderly voting base, (ironically) is social security benefits. They believe that immigrants and “free-loaders” have stolen all of the money out of social security, and they believe that by voting to cut Social Security, they themselves will still be able to collect, but “immigrants and free-loaders” will not be able to collect. They dont realize that by voting to cut social security, they will lose social security. Mental gymnastics, I know. But somehow the MAGA propaganda was powerful enough to brainwash them.  They believe what they’re doing is right, because their core grievances are legitimate. But once they were involved with The Trump Cult, they took on all the other hateful racist, transphobic, homophobic, Islamophobic beliefs. I do believe for some (particularly the elderly voting class) that the hatred and scapegoating came secondary, after the brainwashing. And that their initial concerns, the core cause of their radicalization was legitimate, and they should have been allies if we got to them before MAGA did.

"Respectfully, viewing wide swathes of people as homogeneous bunches is really flawed thinking and not at all accurate in this case.  >Over the last six presidential election cycles, the Catholic vote has been largely split between the Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2004, 52% of Catholics voted for Bush over Kerry (47%). Obama won the Catholic vote in both of his elections beating McCain by seven points (54% vs. 45%) in 2008 and Romney by a smaller margin (50% vs. 48%). Although Trump won the Catholic vote over Clinton in 2016 (50% vs. 46%), the split remained relatively even between Biden and Trump in 2020. PRRI’s 2023 American Values Atlas shows that the percentage of Catholics who identify as Democrats (33% in 2023) has remained largely unchanged over the last decade. However, the percentage of Catholics who are independent has decreased from 37% in 2013 to 30% in 2023, while the percentage of Catholic Republicans has increased from 21% to 28%.  https://www.prri.org/spotlight/understanding-partisanship-among-catholic-voters-ahead-of-the-2024-presidential-election/",BooRadley_ThereHeIs,2025-05-08T18:19:50,5

"It's all the stuff that Jesus said not to do that people wholly ignore that bothers me. Also, that people will use the argument of Jesus and the bible only when it suits their cause or their agenda. That's what the religious leaders did all through the new and old testaments and it's ultimately what got Jesus hung on a cross. Everyone likes to talk about Jesus within the context of their argument. Like he's somehow the ultimate trump card. But they forget that Jesus whipped hundreds of people out of the temple because they had made a mockery of the temple where holiness and reverence should have been the highest priority. No one likes to talk about how Jesus only wanted to change people to be more like him. Zacchious was the cheif tax collector. He was the most hated man in the city. Yet, Jesus goes to his house, He has one dinner with the man, and by the time Jesus left, Zacchious was giving back 4 times what he stole, and then half of everything he had on top of it. One dinner. That's all it took. When he did that, Jesus said ""Salvation has come to this house"". Did Jesus spend time with sinners, and was His life perfect, yes. Did it matter to Him who they were or what they had done, no. Not one bit. But regardless of right, wrong or indifferent, those people almost always walked away changed and left behind who they used to be. Jesus always included people like that in order to make them realize how much He loved them because God made them. But none of them remained the same.

The merchants’ customers weren’t necessarily the poor—they were the pilgrims visiting the temple from other lands, where they used other currencies, and they needed to exchange it for local currency to purchase animals for sacrifice.

"The Cis-Sissy thing is definitely part of it for some. But they hate it most because it's a change to who they think they are. Adding cis to their description is like putting a knife in their kidney because conservatives do not have an identity outside of what has been provided to them by default. Their identity as a person is as unexamined as possible, so anything that calls it into question is anathema to them. It's why they'll freak out if you ask if they've even thought of what it'd be like to be gay, or why they'll say terrible racist shit and say that they're not racist when you call it out. Their identities are built on who they think they should be, but they never examine who they are in the moment, and thus can never connect the two.  So when you say they're cis, or really any description that doesn't fit their expected description, they hate it, they reject it, but they'll never reflect on it.",WASD_click,2025-05-08T22:07:14,109

">Over the last six presidential election cycles, the Catholic vote has been largely split between the Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2004, 52% of Catholics voted for Bush over Kerry (47%). Obama won the Catholic vote in both of his elections beating McCain by seven points (54% vs. 45%) in 2008 and Romney by a smaller margin (50% vs. 48%). Although Trump won the Catholic vote over Clinton in 2016 (50% vs. 46%), the split remained relatively even between Biden and Trump in 2020. PRRI’s 2023 American Values Atlas shows that the percentage of Catholics who identify as Democrats (33% in 2023) has remained largely unchanged over the last decade. However, the percentage of Catholics who are independent has decreased from 37% in 2013 to 30% in 2023, while the percentage of Catholic Republicans has increased from 21% to 28%.  https://www.prri.org/spotlight/understanding-partisanship-among-catholic-voters-ahead-of-the-2024-presidential-election/",BooRadley_ThereHeIs,2025-05-08T18:22:11,5

That’s an embellishment others have added.  He did of course famously flip over the money tables, which is a rather aggressive act, but he didn’t harm anyone. And the offense that aroused his anger was that the merchants were profiting from the worship at the temple (by converting pilgrims’ foreign currency into local coin, which was then in turn used to purchase animals for sacrifice), not just having wealth or turning a profit.  Of course it’s true that Jesus advocated for the poor and criticized the rich throughout his teaching. It’s a core part of Christian ideology, and one televangelists and megachurch preachers seem to forget. But *nowhere* did he advocate for violence or retribution.

Helping the poor is good, but why it is good, who the poor are, and what love even means only make sense if people are made in the image of God.  Jesus did not come just to inspire kindness.

I never said empathy is exclusive to Christianity. I said Christianity grounds empathy in objective reality. If humans are just evolved matter, empathy is simply preference, not obligation. In Christianity, empathy has binding force because every person is made in the image of God.  So yes, atheists can act morally. That was never in question. But the question remains what gives that morality lasting meaning beyond personal or social convenience.

You just restated the same reduction. You define “better Christian” by voting and not being an “asshole.” That is behavior detached from the foundation. Christianity is not moralism. It is union with Christ. Behavior flows from that union but cannot replace it.  You are free to think behavior matters more. The Church says both faith and works are inseparable. Faith without works is dead. Works without faith are empty. Reducing Christianity to voting patterns is flattening something far larger than politics.

"It's hard to break it down specifically because there's so many ways to define it, and there are obviously many different polls that vary in how new the data is, methodology, specifics of what was researched and asked etc.   [I'd start by saying that roughly 2/3rds of Americans still identity as some form of Christian.](https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/)   From there let's break down that 2/3rds.  The largest chunk are Evangelicals, 23% of the overall population, which is 1/3rd of all Christians.  Next we have Catholics at 19%, Mainline Protestant (non-evangelical) around 11%, Historically Black Protestant some 5%, and the remaining ~4% being others like Mormons, Jehovah's, etc.   [Some more useful data to this conversation is a breakdown of how registered voters, by faith group, align with Dem/GOP/other.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/party-identification-among-religious-groups-and-religiously-unaffiliated-voters/)   Among Catholics, 52% are GOP to 44% Dem, leaving ~4% as unaffiliated or listed religion but not party.  Among White Catholics, these numbers go to 61% GOP, 37% Dem, and only 2% otherwise.   So if you know someone is Catholic, there's just over a 50% chance they're GOP.  If you know they're White and Catholic, just over 60% they're GOP.    Protestants (and more specifically Evangelicals) are a different story.  59% of all Protestants are GOP, to 38% Dem.  Roughly the same breakdown as White Catholics.   But when you look at White Evangelicals, a full 85% of them identify as GOP whereas only 14% as Dems.  Less than 1% are otherwise.  They *overwhelmingly* go GOP.   But this also is the general population and the general voting population, of the entire country, not specific areas.  Evangelicals in some red states identify entirely entirely as GOP voters.  Catholics in some blues states are majority Dem.   It becomes hard to delineate specific groups based upon so many factors that can skew results, especially by relative location.  You mention having high Catholic MAGA presence where you are, but this isn't the norm.  Yes, they are a majority GOP, but they're also far out numbered by the number of Evangelicals in the GOP in this country.  And they still have a healthy chunk of Dems in their ranks.  That's not really the case for White Evangelicals, who are 6 to 1 GOP to Dem.  In red states, these numbers would undoubtedly be even higher, with entire congregations having zero Dems and entire areas having basically zero Dem White Evangelicals.   So what do we take from all of this?  Well, for one, MAGA data was hard to find.  I'd love data where they specifically asked if people weren't just GOP but also identified as MAGA.  Then we can look at that data, as those are Trump's most diehard supporters.  We know that, in this survey, 85% of White Evangelicals were GOP.  But what percent of his diehard MAGA supporters are Evangelical?   We also need to consider the fact that, since Trump's political rise, there's been some factors that would skew these numbers.  Yes, MAGA type Republicans are bolder than ever publcily about their support.  But there's also the group of non-MAGA GOP who have seen backlash to MAGA and, while they still vote GOP, have avoided using the label.  Anonymous polling might be a bit less hesitant to be truthful, but if it's a phone number they own, or  in-person conversation exit polls (surrounded by other residents),  they might be wary because it's not entirely anonymous even if the pollsters say the data will be.  If you have a chunk of the GOP, avoiding the GOP label, and they're unevenly distributed among non-MAGA, then MAGA would have an over represented voice in your data.   Anyways, it's all highly relative to where you specifically are. Red vs Blue state.  Urban vs Rural.  Hell, even specific churches, like the Catholic one you mentioned, can just skew one way or the other based upon the people running them.   But, overall, you can expect Evangelicals to be much more likely to be GOP than Dem, versus Catholic only slightly more likely.  And when it comes to the GOP, Evangelicals are the largest religious group among them. 50% of all registered GOP voters saying they're a form of Protestant, while only 20% say Catholic.  With 74% of the GOP saying they're religious, that's a full 2/3rds of all religious Republicans saying they're some form of Protestant, and a majority of that chunk is Evangelical.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-08T20:03:44,4

"Just for anyone reading:  The Satanic Temple sounds like the evil guys in a movie. In reality, quite a bit of it is very similar to the stuff Jesus preached in Christianity. The key difference is no religious/supernatural elements. They don't believe Satan exists and as such obviously don't worship him. They're a very political organization, involved in quite a bit of activism. Basically, they're super lame if you're looking for some hardcore cult that goes around sacrificing people for sweet demonic powers.   The 7 tenets:  *     One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason. *     The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions. *     One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone. *     The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own. *     Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs. *     People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused. *     Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.  According to the organization's website, the mission of the Satanic Temple is to:  ""    ...encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense, oppose injustice, and undertake noble pursuits. The Satanic Temple has publicly confronted hate groups, fought for the abolition of corporal punishment in public schools, applied for equal representation when religious installations are placed on public property, provided religious exemption and legal protection against laws that unscientifically restrict women's reproductive autonomy, exposed harmful pseudo-scientific practitioners in mental health care, organized clubs alongside other religious after-school clubs in schools besieged by proselytizing organizations, and engaged in other advocacy in accordance with our tenets.""",Umbra_RS,2025-05-08T22:09:54,10

"Well explaining ALL of them takes a bit more than what u should be willing to trust from any person...the best way to know is to learn about what each believes the scriptures say, and compare it to what u find out they actually say when u read it yourself.  BUT  As far as Christian, Evangelical, and Catholic go (those were the 3 u asked about right?)  A Christian is someone who follows Jesus ..what he taught. Makes him ""Lord"" or ""Ruler"" of their life by living their life the way he demonstrated we should live (his whole life being the example of how we were supposed to live, i mean, not JUST his words)  Many ""denominations"" have ""Christians"" mixed in with the fakes (ppl who call themselves followers but dont actually follow...wheat and tares, as Jesus taught).  Evangelicals r a denomination. Some of them seek to follow Christ, while some of them just do ""religion"" and have no real relationship/walk with the one they call ""Lord"". Evangelical comes from evangelism, an english word that comes from a greek word meaning to tell ppl a message (think town crier sorta deal lol). So Evangelical is sort of a denomination that puts a bit more emphasis on the evangelizing then perhaps other parts of what scripture teaches (like how baptists tend to focus a bit more on the baptism stuff then the rest, as another example).  Catholic is a bit of a touchy one to open tho. Again u will find true Christians among catholics, seeking to learn and follow Jesus, but u will also find many who aren't real followers and r just doing the ""religion"" thing with no real relationship.  Catholicism was created essentially by the Roman Empire as a way to take an up and coming ""religious belief"" they knew they couldnt fight against, and fight it by embracing and then twisting it. Essentially, a roman emperor decided to make it the state religion and then mixed a bunch of already existing pagan stuff into the mix to make it more palatable so that the citizens of the empire could be more easily regulated.  Jesus taught that we should call no one our father, cause we have one father (god) and noone teacher cause we have one teacher (christ), yet Catholicism directly disobeys christ in this as part of their hierarchy of titles. The Pope is even considered the ""most holy father""  BUT that doesnt mean there arent ppl who sincerely do their best to follow jesus among catholics, and are just not aware of those details due to a lack of knowledge of scripture. Most ""religious"" ppl dont read their bibles, they just get their bible from someone behind a podium at the front of the church room and never touch it the rest of the week.  When u get ur ""truth"" from a middleman instead of the source, you will always be misled and pulled in the direction that middleman decides to twist u for their agenda.   But thats why i said at the start the best way is to learn about the different groups urself and compare them to what the bible as a whole in its entirety actually says rather than just listening to me or anyone else tell u what they say. When u get the truth from the source u cannot b misled by anyone because u c thru their lies.  Anyway...thats probably enough to give u the cliffnotes of it. If ur interested in more info, i encourage u to dive in and c for urself. NEVER just believe what ppl TELL u to believe...real christianity is about YOUR relationship with god...not your obedience to a list of religious checkpoints someone told u you had to observe and obey. Its about walking with him and learning with him by having a relationship with him thru the record that was left of his life.

"You want to know who came up with that ""white Jesus"" in the first place? It wasn't Christians. It was Catholics. Ain't a single Christian I know even remotely believes that Jesus was white. And I frankly couldn't have cared less. Cause whether Jesus was middle eastern, anglo Saxon, Hispanic, African American, or white as a sheet, it wouldn't have mattered because the outcome would've been the same. And to be completely honest, if Jesus came now, it would be the Catholics that would have the hardest time knowing him. They say that it's Jesus that started their church. So that would make them his people. But if you go back to the day Jesus was baptized, no one even recognized him when he got there. They just knew him as Joseph and Mary's boy. But then John pointed at him and said ""Behold...."" No one even recognized him as the messiah or of anything significant. They all missed it. They got to know him real quick, but even on the day he died, his own people still didn't know who he was and still didn't recognize what He was about. So, the merits of the argument that white people wouldn't like who Jesus really was, it's got no merit and it's old. Now, go back 40 years ago, sure. I think that's correct to assume that white people would've had a problem with what Jesus really looked like. However, if a white person has a problem with Jesus being brown, then I would question that persons salvation from the get go. Any person that is a Christian, that claims that they have a problem with any person of color, simply because they are a person of color, does not belong to the kingdom.

Really not sure. But one night a week for 6 months to a year (I forget) for basically freedom to do whatever.   Overall the church community was maybe more liberal ish at least compared to evangelicals. But it was more of a community than anything. I still loosely take part in events and volunteering, just don't practice or attend masses. They might mention it once in a while, but don't really care. It kind of overlaps with the polish community I grew up in so it is a lot more cultural for me and other members than religious.   But I know full well a lot of other church groups can be very cult like and ostracize people who don't go to mass. Which leads to people being a bit trapped. Don't believe or agree with the faith, but don't want to lose that sense of community.",slipperyMonkey07,2025-05-08T20:05:39,5

I still feel a connection to Catholicism, and I can admire some of the works, particularly of the Jesuits in Latin America.

"Yeah if you don't like abortion your stance should be less ""good parental leave"" and more ""proper sex education, easy access to birth control, provide good opportunities to young people"" (though I know that birth control is a bit of a touchy subject within the Catholic Church).   If people who don't want to get pregnant don't end up pregnant that's an easy reduction in abortion numbers. Won't be 0 of course because birth control can fail, coercion can happen, medical problems that endanger the mother can happen, but a true reduction based on less demand rather than less access is already a win.

"I was raised Catholic, and I don't recall a great deal of fundamentalism. Paul VI and the opening up of the church, Vatican II, getting rid of the latin mass etc. seemed pretty popular at the time. IIRC the rabid anti-abortion types started getting noisy around the late 1970's when Roe v Wade happened.   However, statistics I've seen suggest probably 80% of Catholics don't care about and don't follow the prohibition on birth control for example. The days of old widows dressed in black and going to mass every morning are pretty much gone, as is the ""every family wants one son to be a priest"".  A large number of the clergy I used to meet ended up leaving the priesthood in the 80's.  The principal of our (catholic) high school was an ex-prest married to an ex-nun.  ETA: Dr. Henry Morgentaler set up an abortion clinic in French-Canadian Catholic Montreal, in the 1970's.  The Quebec government, very Catholic, prosecuted him. The only way prosecutors could find someone willing to testify was to threaten an African student that if she did not testify, they would deport her back to Africa and tell her family why, meaning likely she would be killed (how Christian of them!).  The jury in Catholic Montreal found him not guilty. The appeal court substituted ""Guilty"" (they could do that back then) and hit went to the Supreme court of Canada, who said ""no, you must retry him."" Second trial, the jury also acquitted him.  it stopped when the government changed and a Quebec progressive government refused to prosecute. He continued operating his clinic. Eventually, Canada's abortion law was declared unconstitutional, and since then Canada has had no law regarding abortion, other than the requirement that since it is covered by healthcare, it must be equally available to all citizens regardless of geography.",GrumpyCloud93,2025-05-08T18:59:43,4

When the world keeps shifting its morals every two years, the Church actually says, “Here is what’s true. Here is what’s good. Here is what’s holy.”  If anything, cradle Catholics who drift progressive often ignore the Church’s teaching on stuff like abortion, gender, marriage, then claim they’re following the “real spirit” of Jesus.

He's got a country of not just differing but foundationally opposing beliefs, and no way to make both sides happy, keep the peace, and still uphold justice.  One of my classes even did a deep dive into what we (in theory) knew about the geopolitical climate at the time which seemed like an absolute powder keg waiting to blow.    Two other areas parishes I've lived in told the story the exact same way, except with two different understandings of the takeaway-  One is that this is a true moral failing of Pilate as both a politician and a person because he did not stand against the killing of an innocent man just because a mob demanded it. There was always cliché discussions of avoiding cowardice and standing up to bullies.  Not a bad message per se, but I hated how it removed Pilate's humanity, and felt very short-sighted when it came to other consequences.  The other takeaway was regarding Pilate as a shamelessly greedy man, more concerned with protecting his political career than saving an innocent man's life.  Whether that was to impress Rome by subduing the commotion quickly and efficiently, or to avoid the political fallout by washing his hands and passing the blame.  The discussion around this one was taking accountability for one's own actions & decisions, and being steadfast in your morals regardless of repercussions.  Still not necessarily bad, but it always felt very cartoon villain-y, and seemed to get off topic to the distressing glorification of religious martyrs for upholding their morals.  I know which one I prefer, but the older I get, the more I appreciate just how many sides and viewpoints there are to the exact same story, none of them necessarily the only true one.  It taught me a lot about being respectful of other's opinions and the importance of trying to understand why they have those opinions.

This is why it’s a losing issue for the left. When people are told that science has always supported multiple genders or that most cultures recognized them, it comes across as out of touch with both history and reality. The truth is, most people were taught that there are two genders corresponding to biological sex, and they still believe that today.  Calling those people ignorant or hateful doesn’t change their minds. It just drives them further away. You can advocate for respect and inclusion without pretending these ideas have always been universally accepted. The more this conversation gets pushed into extremes, the more backlash it creates.

"Fair. You don’t believe it. But notice, we’re not disagreeing on what compassion looks like. We’re disagreeing on what it is. You say goodness is self evident. I say it’s revealed. You say help people to help people. I ask, why are people worth helping?  You appeal to altruism. But if we’re just atoms and instincts, what makes altruism binding, or beautiful, or even intelligible? The claim that goodness stands on its own sounds noble, but without a grounding source, it’s just preference dressed up in principle.  I’m not saying belief is a prerequisite for action. I’m saying belief reveals the meaning of that action. Christ doesn’t negate compassion. He names it. He incarnates it. He fulfills it.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-08T22:20:39,-9
"That is not what I said. I never claimed non-believers cannot have compassion. I said that without belief in objective value, compassion becomes a personal or cultural preference, not something grounded in ultimate truth.  You can act compassionately as an atheist. The question is not whether compassion exists. The question is why compassion ought to exist. Christianity does not claim a monopoly on good actions. It claims to explain why good itself has real, unchanging meaning.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T01:20:38,1

"You say you give meaning to compassion. But that just means it’s your preference, not objective, not universal, not binding. What if someone else gives a different meaning? What if their “good” includes cruelty?  “Just be a good person” assumes a shared definition of good. But that’s the whole issue. Without grounding, “good” is whatever anyone says it is. You’re borrowing moral clarity from a worldview that assumes people have real, inherent value, and then denying the foundation that makes that value more than a feeling.  It’s not about making it complicated. It’s about being honest. If morality is real, not just convenient, it must come from something higher than taste or instinct. Otherwise, “be good” is just a slogan with no spine.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T03:53:05,1
"Appreciate the honesty. That’s really the core of the disagreement.  You’re saying morality doesn’t need to mean more than personal or social convenience. I’m saying that if that’s all it is, then it’s not really morality. It’s just preference or strategy. It’s about what works, not about what’s right.  And that’s fine if you’re consistent with it. But most people aren’t. Most people still say things like genocide, slavery, or child abuse are not just unfortunate or unpopular, but actually wrong. Not wrong because society dislikes them, but wrong even if society approves. Once you say something is wrong regardless of opinion, you’ve stepped beyond convenience and into objective morality.  So if morality is just social agreement, then it changes with the group. And if someone disagrees with the group, they’re not wrong, they’re just different. That’s moral relativism. You can live with that if you want, but you can’t then treat moral claims as if they’re universally true.  You can choose that framework. But you can’t call it truth.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-10T15:11:05,1
"Thanks for clarifying. But even with your update, the underlying structure remains the same: you’re using the term “Christian” functionally, as a label for moral behavior you approve of, rather than ontologically, as union with the risen Christ.  Your claim that Trump support is “anti Christian” implies a moral framework grounded in behavior alone. But Christianity is not a moral system, it’s a metaphysical claim about reality: that God entered time, died, rose, and now unites Himself to us through grace. That union, not social alignment, is the core.  Yes, that union changes behavior, but the behavior flows from the relation, not the other way around. An atheist who does good is reflecting natural law, which is good, but without union with Christ it remains incomplete. Conversely, a professing Christian acting against love is failing to live their union, but they still have the ontological seal unless they fully sever it.  Your Lutheran upbringing emphasized personal relationship over Church structure, that’s a valid Protestant perspective. But even that tradition (at its best) doesn’t reduce Christianity to a moral test. What you’re describing now is a secularized moral Christianity stripped of metaphysics, functioning only as a social ethic.  That may be useful rhetorically, but it’s not Christianity.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T04:45:55,1

"Yep, I believe as a clinical term, it's use was supposed to take away the stigma of ""abnormal"" and ""Normal"" from those who deviated from the expected baseline, but of course, some people took insult to feeling ""othered"" by the term, and others took the term and used it further as an insult, seeing them insulted by the othering.   I believe there is a conversation to be had about how a word SOUNDS vs how it is taken, though. Harsh sounding words often end up hitting harder than softer sounding ones, such as using the  ""R-word"" instead of ""Disabled"". Even the word ""Moron"" is not viewed as much of a slur as the R-word, even though they can be used interchangeably, and I believe this has to do with the harshness of the sound dictating the ""Feel"" of the impact of the word.  I think that's what I was getting at with my shower thought joke, that ""Cis"" does have a very sharp S, assaultive sound that I can't deny ""Hits"" differently than ""Typical"" or ""Normal"", or even ""Hetero"" or ""Straight"". I believe that defining forms of language need to be much more carefully chosen because of this to avoid autonomous ""Insult"" that comes with these harsher sounding defining words, thus Cis and Cisgender may not be appropriate ""Linguistic"" terms to use to define ""baseline gender presentation"" in the way our brains are wired to accept linguistic characterizations of things to define onesself... but when Transgender was selected, the opposite of Trans in Latin is... of course Cis, so it made sense to use the opposing terms.  Our curse and swear words all tend to be very harsh sounding, so when you define someone using a hard word, it is easy to turn into a slur or swear as well, no matter how begnin it started. And likewise, it's easy to turn a Soft sounding slur into something more acceptable to the community as a whole, like ""Gay"" and ""Queer"". Even ""Femboy"" is a reclaimed, soft ""Slur"" that originated from hate and fetishizing that now people use to define themselves. But even the N word needed to drop the hard R for the community that it was used against to be able to own and reclaim it.  Either way, the term ""Cis"" has been used in non gender/biological studies(Such as chemistry and other sciences) for much longer than combining it with ""Gender"" to make ""Transgender"". It's only when it became a thing to define human nature, and it's lack of clear, relateable definition, and those thinking like you that it may have been short for something else could only really see it as something that might be meant to mean something offensive.",Ansiau,2025-05-09T12:32:29,2

"I disagree it would be that few, but that’s more a disagreement of scale not of substance.  I also clearly disagree with your overall anti-Christian sentiment that I feel is dulling the edges of an otherwise good argument.  You’re mostly right, a large portion of people are what I will call “culturally Christian”.  Which is to say, their identity as a Christian has very little to do with what they actually believe and everything to do with the fact they were born into a family that identifies as Christian, a community that is overwhelmingly Christian, they have known going to church on sundays as just what they do their entire life, etc.  It’s a part of their own self-identity, they can’t even imagine NOT considering themselves Christian.  When you and the people around you are “Christian” by default, it very quickly becomes a case where everything can be excused to fit within that framework regardless of if it is technically Christian or not, because people of all personality types and moral levels are still “Christian” so what they do, by default, gets associated with “Christianity” regardless of if it was taught or not.  Ultimately what they believe and act on is defined by the culture they were raised in, not the beliefs which are important to the religion that the community follows.  Sometimes they are closer to the same thing, sometimes they are further, but the key is that all people, religious or not, act similarly.  It’s just that for the irreligious, there is no hypocrisy because there isn’t any supposedly objective moral code they claim to believe in that is clearly different to what they SAY they believe in.  99% of all religious conflict in the world’s history is fundamentally cultural, not truly religious.",Welpe,2025-05-08T19:35:53,0

I was also taught God doesn't make mistakes, but from the context of he would never do something as cruel as put the wrong gender in the wrong body. If someone believed they were trans then that's the devil talking.   I left faith a while back and don't believe in God anymore, but that's what I remember being taught back when I went to church.

The anti-Semites have the right to play.** They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

"The real question is whether political support equals personal endorsement. Christians aren’t called to worship leaders, they’re called to weigh policies, discern prudently, and never forget that no candidate is the Kingdom.  If a policy reduces abortion, protects religious liberty, or upholds justice, a Christian can support it without canonizing the politician behind it. That’s not moral compromise. That’s engagement in a fallen world where we’re forced to choose between imperfect options.  The danger is thinking that voting is holiness, or that opposing someone is righteousness. Supporting or opposing a candidate should flow from informed conscience, not emotional branding.  So yes, support must always be tempered by prophetic critique. But rejecting all cooperation with flawed people would’ve made Daniel disobey Nebuchadnezzar, Joseph refuse Pharaoh, and Christ avoid dining with sinners.  We engage. We discern.

"I get where you’re coming from, but just because morality originates in social dynamics or survival strategies doesn’t mean it’s only that. Over time, those strategies harden into principles, and people start to believe in them deeply, even when they go against personal interest or public opinion. That’s not just convenience anymore. That’s conviction.  Think about language. It started as grunts and signs to coordinate hunting, purely practical. But now we write poetry, swear oaths, and express love or grief through it. It started as a tool, but it became something bigger. Morality can work the same way.  As for calling things like slavery or genocide objectively wrong, well, we don’t need a cosmic scoreboard to take a stand. It’s enough that we can reason, empathize, and recognize suffering. If everyone agreed slavery was good, that wouldn’t make it okay. But the reason we feel that, even hypothetically, is because centuries of moral development, experience, and struggle have built that conviction into us.  So no, it’s not ""just preference."" It’s evolved, reinforced, and reasoned-out values that we commit to. And when enough people commit to them, not just because it works, but because they believe it’s right, then you’ve got morality with real weight. Even without a god or some objective anchor floating in space.  So maybe it didn’t drop from the sky, maybe we built it. Doesn’t make it fake.

It would be a mistake if God put a man in a woman's body or vice versa, so it's not a real thing, it's demonic influence. I heard similar stuff about gay people also.  If you think about it, it would be pretty cruel for God to put a women in a man's body or vice versa. It's pretty unnecessary hardship to place on someone especially given that it's not widely accepted.  I'm pretty sure that's a big part of the reason I eventually lost my faith.

"My point is that lacking empathy *for some specific group* is very different from lacking the *capacity* for empathy in general, which is what it sounds like that psychologist was talking about.  Lacking empathy for a group is easy, it's just called ""getting tired of their shit"". If you think someone has it out for you, is dastardly evil, and generally can not be trusted, there's a decent chance at some point you'll decide they can go fuck themselves and in fact if someone were to kill them, good riddance. If anything, the more intensely you fear for your group, the more likely you are to engage in extreme measures (see the Israel-Palestine situation, where many people on both sides are thoroughly convinced that the battle is an existential one that can only end with the annihilation of one or the other, which then turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy).  Obviously doesn't have to be a *correct* assessment. It can be induced by sufficient application of propaganda and falsehoods. But from the standpoint of someone who actually *believes* the propaganda, some random German citizen in 1935 who thinks the Jews really are somehow an evil cabal in cahoots to destroy them all, a violent response is proportionate. They can advocate it without lacking empathy. Actually being the guy who shoots people on a daily basis is a different thing, because empathy as an instinct responds a lot more strongly to actual stimuli like eye contact and sound. It's why you also see things like putting a hood on top of people due to be executed. Empathy is an evolved instinct, and we didn't evolve to interact in the abstract with vast societies of millions of individuals through news and elections. We evolved for tribes where everyone knew everyone else. As Stalin put it, a single death is a tragedy, and a million deaths is a statistic.",SimoneNonvelodico,2025-05-09T15:24:49,1

"You’ve framed it elegantly, but the core problem remains. If consciousness is a natural phenomenon emerging from material processes, then love and hate are just chemical patterns. Calling one “better” than the other is still a value judgment imposed from within the system, not something the system itself can justify.  Saying cruelty is “like hurting yourself” assumes an ought from an is. Why should the universe care if it harms itself? Why prefer compassion over indifference if both arise from the same indifferent natural process?  You speak of a choice, but choice presupposes real moral responsibility. That only makes sense if there is something above the system that defines good and evil objectively. Otherwise love is just preference plus survival adaptation.  Pantheism gives you poetry, but not grounding. Christianity offers both poetry and grounding. Not “we are the universe.” Instead, “we are created persons, known and loved by a Creator, made for communion not absorption.” That is why love is real. It comes from real Being, not from accident.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T00:06:59,1
"Totally fair question.  Yes, as an atheist you can value compassion. But the deeper issue is this: if good and evil are just personal or cultural, then they aren’t true in any lasting sense, they’re just opinions.  Christianity doesn’t claim to own good actions. It claims that goodness itself has an objective foundation: the nature of God. Without that, moral values shift with time, place, or preference. They might still be useful, but they aren’t binding.  That’s the difference. Not what we do, but why it matters.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-10T15:15:58,1
"You’ve just made my point.  If everything is a preference, then your claim that “compassion is good” is no stronger than someone else saying “cruelty is good.” And if Christianity is just another preference, then so is abolitionism, feminism, or human rights. They’re all equally arbitrary.  But you don’t live like that. You argue as if some things really are wrong, not just personally unpleasant, but wrong in themselves. That only makes sense if there’s an objective moral structure, not just taste.  So the question isn’t “do we prefer meaning?” It’s “does meaning exist apart from our preferences?”  If not, then nothing matters. If so, then we’re accountable to something higher than ourselves.

Undermining Democratic Institutions:  	•	1999 Constitution: Chávez rewrote the constitution to consolidate power, extend presidential terms, and weaken checks and balances.  	•	Judicial Takeover: He stacked the Supreme Court with loyalists, undermining judicial independence.  	•	Congress Dissolution: Dissolved the existing Congress and replaced it with a new National Assembly dominated by his allies.   2. Authoritarian Control:  	•	Media Intimidation: Chávez aggressively attacked private media, labeling them enemies and paving the way for censorship.  	•	Militarization of Government: Installed military officers in key civilian posts, blurring the line between civil governance and military control.  3. Economic Mismanagement:  	•	Price Controls: Implemented strict price controls that discouraged production and led to shortages.  	•	Capital Flight and Investor Fear: His aggressive rhetoric against private enterprise and threats of expropriation scared off domestic and foreign investors.  	•	Undermined PDVSA (state oil company): Pushed political loyalists into key PDVSA roles, disrupting its professional management even before the 2002 strike.  *Does any of that 👆there remind you of someone else?*  **I LIVED THAT**  it wasn't the us who closed TV stations that were not conforming to state media.

It’s a sharp satire. But satire isn’t theology, and mocking a distortion of Christianity isn’t the same as understanding Christ.

">That is strategy. “I help so I get helped” does not explain why I should help the helpless, the unborn, the elderly, or the stranger who can do nothing for me.  I disagree here. A secular view on why should someone help the helpless (and others) is based on self-preservation and the preservation of a society where to assure your integrity you should assure the integrity of others. Leaving these people on their own may cause disturbance and chaos in the group which is a threat to one's integrity.  Even in a society based purely on strategy, morality can still arise when strategic behaviors (like helping others) become social norms through repetition. Those norms are internalized emotionally via culture (guilt, pride, etc.) then people recognize that fairness benefits everyone, leading to shared ethical rules. This leads to Individuals seeing these actions as part of their moral identity, not just tactics. So, morality evolves from strategy into principled behavior through habit, culture, and reason, not from a religious perspective.",Aireituomen_5561,2025-05-09T21:27:03,1

"I think the point here is the definition of ""empathy"". Empathy as a psychological term refers to a very specific reaction, the ability of our brain to emulate the emotions that we see from the body language of others around us, and what that entails. If I rationally contemplate the notion that other human beings must have the same inner experience that I have, and thus should also be spared the same suffering that I would not desire, that's not empathy. That's something happening at the level of the rational mind. It's like the difference between withdrawing your hand the moment you feel it burning (instinctual reaction) and drawing out a fire prevention system for a building (rational planning). Both things meant to avert damage from fire, but they operate at two different levels of the human mind.  A lot of people like to celebrate empathy as this big solution to everything but in fact very often empathy, as technically defined in psychology, is *part of the problem*. That is, people only doing moral reasoning at the gut level, triggered by direct contact, and being unable to actually generalize those principles via reasoning to people they've never seen and systems too large for the more primitive parts of our mind to fully engage with. And someone who is a psychopath is lacking that specific empathic instinct, it's the kind of person who absolutely *could* simply shoot someone in the head while looking them in the eyes and feel nothing (of course not even all Nazis, or all SS, were like this; they're a small minority of people). The regular non-psychopaths have empathy all right, but that doesn't stop them from voting for someone else to shoot people in the head in a far off place, because empathy doesn't give a shit about that, it's too narrow.",SimoneNonvelodico,2025-05-10T13:19:44,1

"That’s a solid explanation of how behavior can turn into norms. But that’s still describing how people come to feel something is moral. I’m asking what makes it actually moral. Why should someone do the right thing even when it costs them everything?  If morality grows out of strategy and habit, then it is still built on usefulness. That works until someone decides the group’s wellbeing is not worth their sacrifice. And if their personal judgment says to walk away, your framework cannot say they are wrong. It can only say they broke a pattern.  Christianity says the helpless have value not because they are useful, but because they reflect the image of God. Sacrificial love is not efficient, but it is real. Without something higher than survival or group stability, I do not see what ultimately justifies it.  It may be useful. It may be beautiful.

"You have just restated the same unresolved tension. You speak of a cosmic oneness that somehow prefers love to hate, but then deny any objective right or wrong. You say there is no moral guide, yet define hate as division and love as unification. That is a moral claim.  If the universe has no intrinsic purpose, then saying love is better than hate is just preference dressed as cosmic poetry. It feels noble but cannot bind anyone to it. Why should anyone choose oneness if the alternative is equally valid? You cannot answer that within your system.  You say grounding is a comfortable lie. I say lack of grounding is a comfortable escape. Christianity does not offer absorption into impersonal energy. It offers communion with a personal Creator. Personhood is not a veil to be shed. It is the very reality love is made for.  Your system dissolves the person into the cosmos. Mine says the cosmos was made for the person.

"I do understand what you’re saying. But you’re smuggling in a full moral framework without grounding it, and that tension isn’t new or misunderstood. It’s acknowledged by some of the most respected atheist thinkers.  Nietzsche warned that without God, you lose the right to Christian morality:  “When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet.” Twilight of the Idols  Sartre agreed:  “Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist.”  He believed we must invent our own values, but admitted there’s no objective “ought”, only choice.  J.L. Mackie was direct:  “There are no objective values.” Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong  Even Dawkins admits morality, under atheism, is evolutionarily useful but not objectively real:  “Science can tell you what is, but not what ought to be.”  So when you say “nothing matters, and therefore everything matters,” you’re using poetic contradiction to avoid the consequence of your premise. It sounds noble, but if nothing truly matters, then neither does suffering, justice, compassion, or “the greater good.”  You live and argue as if some things really are better.

"That is a fair point and I agree that we should always press whoever is in office to lift up the vulnerable. But to be honest, Biden’s record has serious areas that directly contradict Catholic moral teaching, and we cannot ignore them.  Most serious is his aggressive support of abortion access, including attempts to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law, reversing the Mexico City Policy so U.S. funds can support abortion overseas, and fighting state level abortion restrictions. The Church is absolutely clear that abortion is an intrinsic moral evil.  He has also pushed gender ideology policies that run against Catholic teaching on the nature of the human person, including directives on transgender rights in schools, sports, and healthcare. His support for same sex marriage also rejects the Church’s teaching on sacramental marriage.  There have been moves to limit religious exemptions to contraception mandates under the Affordable Care Act, despite the Church’s clear stance against contraception as morally wrong. And his administration has supported expanding access to IVF, which the Church opposes because it leads to the destruction of embryos and violates human dignity.  So yes, we must call every leader to compassion. But compassion without truth becomes compromise. The Catholic moral vision demands we care for both the poor and the unborn, protect human dignity at every stage, and resist policies that undermine core teachings. Neither party gets a free pass.

"The idea that morality has to be anchored in something above us, like God or a universal truth, is assuming that human experience isn’t enough. Morality doesn’t need to come from outside to be real. It can come from us, from our ability to reason, to feel, to recognize suffering and choose compassion anyway. When someone gives everything for the sake of another person, even when it’s not efficient or rewarded, that act doesn’t become meaningless just because it isn’t backed by a higher power. In fact, it might be more powerful because it came from a personal decision. No cosmic commandment. Just a human being choosing to do good because they believed it mattered.  You’re right that in a naturalistic framework, we can’t say someone is objectively wrong for walking away from sacrifice. But we can still say they’ve betrayed the values we’ve built together. Values that keep society livable, that protect the weak, and that express who we want to be. Those aren’t just patterns. They’re commitments. They’re what hold us together.  So morality doesn’t have to be absolute to be meaningful. Its strength lies in how we carry it, how we pass it on, how we live by it even when it’s hard. It’s not about something higher than survival. It’s about choosing to be more than survival.  That doesn’t make it less true. It makes it deeply human.",Aireituomen_5561,2025-05-10T18:29:40,1

"You’ve just proven my central claim. You say morality is just agency, free will, and consequences. That means it has no external truth, only internal preference. That works for survival, not for objective right and wrong.  You say the universe exists to exist. Fine, but existence alone does not create value. It explains nothing about why compassion is better than cruelty, why self sacrifice is noble, or why dignity should exist at all. Without grounding, “good” becomes whatever the stronger wills.  You also claim “you do not need an answer for why.” That is convenient but unsatisfying. Humans always ask why, because we know instinctively that mere existence without meaning is not enough.  As for communion, you are right about the root word. But communion presupposes persons who share. Absorption into an impersonal source eliminates personhood, which also eliminates the very relationship that love requires.  Yes, there is a choice. I believe the soul is personal, unrepeatable, and eternal. Christianity says persons do not dissolve but are called to perfect communion, not annihilation. Love requires a lover and a beloved. Your system erases both into a vague whole. Mine preserves them forever. That is the real difference.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T02:17:01,0
"I’m not saying Christianity has an exclusive claim to moral feelings or behaviors. I fully agree that empathy, reciprocity, and a desire to avoid suffering appear in many cultures. That’s not in dispute.  What I am saying is that without a grounding beyond personal or collective preference, those values have no ultimate authority. They’re useful, yes. But usefulness is not the same as truth.  You say, “I don’t like suffering, and it’s considerate to treat others the way I want to be treated.” I agree. But that’s a statement of taste and strategy, not moral obligation. If someone says, “I do like causing suffering, and I don’t care about consideration,” what framework do you appeal to to say they’re wrong?  You’ve built your moral reasoning on a basic form of the Golden Rule. But that principle assumes moral symmetry and shared dignity. That’s a moral claim, not a biological one. So the question remains: why should anyone be bound by it?  As for the quotes I shared, they weren’t appeals to authority, but examples of the internal tension. These thinkers weren’t Christian. They were simply honest about the consequences of a world without moral transcendence. You don’t have to agree with them, but their point is still worth confronting.  Atheism may not be hierarchical, but coherence still matters. If your worldview says morality is just preference, but you treat it as more than that, you’re not being consistent. And consistency is how we test whether our foundations can hold what we build on them.  So I’m not arguing you can’t be good without God. I’m asking what makes your definition of good anything more than a preference. Because if it’s just preference, then there’s no reason it should bind anyone else. And if it should bind others, then we’re talking about something higher than preference. Which is the whole point.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T19:26:01,1

"For the most part, people generally don't hurt others for no reason. Humans are on average highly cooperative and dislike seeing others be harmed. Sure, some violent sociopaths exist, but they are A) rare and B) can be treated. A lot of harm is more linked to societal biases due to uneducation and fear of the unknown than a genuine rejection of morality. A greater focus on critical thinking skills and learning to understand each other would end a *lot* of harm.  If someone really needs motivation to not go around murdering people, that's what we have *laws* for. Legal punishment and rehabilitation for harming others is one of the basic aspects of society, and are far more useful than hoping that they'll go to Hell. And they need to be binding for everyone because it is *for the greater good*. A society does not work without a bunch of people following it, and if individuals try to break away from the agreed-upon rules, then they can simply be dealt with.  Now, not everyone devotes their life to spreading morality, and I certainly would not. However, compassion can be just as much an excuse for helping others as a religious duty to do so. The idea you're putting forward is that we need to constantly strive to do good in every action, but allowing it to come naturally is actually a much simpler option.  Also, your argument is, to me, utter nonsense. Morality derived from God is just as much a preference as anything else in my eyes, simply because I don't believe in God.

"You’ve made your position clear: no objective right or wrong, just relative choice. But then you pivot, saying truth might exist, might be unsatisfying, and might be found through exploration.  That contradiction is key.  You deny objective morality, yet speak of truth as something possibly discoverable. But truth, if real, isn’t relative. If morality has no objective structure, then calling anything “true” is just another taste. So why care about curiosity, science, or discovery? Why not choose stagnation, cruelty, or apathy? In a relativist system, no choice is better, only preferred. You live as if meaning matters, but claim it doesn’t.  You also invoke near death experiences and “ego death” as hints of something real beyond the individual. I don’t reject that, on the contrary, I believe those point toward the transcendent. But they don’t prove impersonal dissolution. They prove that we are more than brain chemistry. And the experience of being “home” presupposes a self who can remember, relate, receive.  Your system ultimately negates that self, it speaks of love, but dissolves the lover. It speaks of connection, but erases the ones connecting. That isn’t union. That’s erasure.  I believe love is real because persons are real irreducible, unrepeatable, eternal. Christianity doesn’t reject mystery. It says the “why” isn’t abstract, it’s a who. A person, not a concept. Communion, not absorption.  And yes, that requires faith. But so does your claim that it all might mean nothing. The only difference is that my faith affirms the self, preserves the other, and gives love eternal ground.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T15:00:13,1
"You didn’t actually answer the question. I’m not asking what most people do. I’m asking what makes your idea of morality binding for someone who doesn’t agree with it. Saying “most people are cooperative” or “we don’t like suffering” is a description, not a justification. Norms aren’t morality. Just because something is common doesn’t make it right.  Second, you’ve replaced “good” with “useful.” You said laws and punishment deter harm “for the greater good.” But unless you can define good outside of utility, you’re not talking about morality. You’re talking about social management. That’s not ethics. That’s strategy.  Third, appealing to “society” as the moral standard is circular. If morality is just what society agrees on, then slavery was moral when society agreed on it. So was genocide. If society defines good, then no society can ever be wrong. That’s not a moral framework. That’s moral relativism hiding behind consensus.  Fourth, saying morality from God is “just a preference” because you don’t believe in God is not an argument. Disbelief doesn’t cancel an ontological claim. I’m asking whether your framework can justify moral obligation. If your answer is, “It feels right to me,” then you’re proving my point. Without something higher, your morality is just feeling.  Lastly, you haven’t explained why anyone should follow a moral rule they disagree with. If your answer is “because of laws,” then morality is just obedience to power. That’s not morality. That’s control. And if it’s “for the greater good,” you’re back to pragmatism, not ethics.  So again, I’m not saying you can’t behave morally without believing in God. I’m asking what makes your idea of morality anything more than preference. If it’s just preference, then there’s no reason it should bind anyone else. And if it should bind others, then you’ve already left the realm of preference and entered the realm of something higher.

"You are conflating the truth about the purpose of the universe (if there is one) with truth about what is right and what is wrong, a moral truth. That may or may not exist. But I believe it does not. Not one without relativity to a goal/outcome.   The reason I live in the light of love and compassion is because it nurtures the spirit. Cruelty and apathy leads to isolation and loneliness which destroy the spirit. ""Spirit"" here being our connection to the universe, a withdrawal from this connection leads to despair. There is meaning in the tug and pull between unity and isolation (to me), but that is from my perspective, only from a relative point of view can I attribute meaning.   I see your point of view/belief, I find it a comfortable one. That we are ""Told"" by a God what is wrong and what is right. A God external to ourselves. I don't believe there is a God external to us, external to the Universe, only the Universe itself of which we are a small part.   Humanity may not be alone in the universe, but we are alone right now (without going into woo-woo space like the ""Law of One""). And the sooner we realize we are all we have the sooner we will put aside our differences and work towards a better future.

"You’ve expressed your worldview clearly, and I respect your honesty. But your position still contradicts itself.  You say morality is relative, just personal values based on outcomes like “nurturing the spirit” or “avoiding despair.” But those outcomes are already value laden. Why is connection better than isolation? Why is despair bad? Why should unity be preferred over cruelty? If morality is relative, these aren’t truths, they’re tastes.  Yet you speak as if compassion, love, and unity are not just your preferences, but better than hate and cruelty. You say people who choose darkness should be “brought into the light.” But without an objective standard, what makes your light the real one? Why not flip it? If there’s no higher moral reference, you have no basis to say one path is right and another wrong, only that you prefer one.  You also describe “spirit” as connection to the universe. But connection implies separation. Persons. Distinct identities in relationship. If everything dissolves into one impersonal whole, then love, unity, and meaning all collapse into metaphor. They feel good, but they aren’t true.  You said my view is “comfortable”, that we’re told what’s right and wrong by a God outside the system. But I’m not after comfort, I’m after coherence. If there’s no God, then everything is contingent, including your hope. And hope with no foundation is just projection.  You long for love, truth, and unity. So do I.

"No, because refusing to accept it had a different meaning and that people still use it as such (ie, without negative connotation) is wilful ignorance. The same way refusing to accept that it has different meaning (it's almost as if I said the two sides are talking past each other) is also wilful ignorance. But unlike the latter, the former is continuing the co-opting of the word woke, and most of the proponents of the meaning with the negative connation just so happen to also be against the very things the proponents of the original meaning fought for. Isn't that odd?   I'm a descriptivist first, but I respect people's cultures, and if for the sake of protecting them I have to don the prescriptivist cap, so be it. But this does not mean I am saying woke does not have one meaning nor are some meanings illegitimate. I am saying that it should've never been co-opted in the first place, and I do advocate for everyone to stop using it with a negative connotation. The point of language is communication and clearly that purpose is not being served right now. It's the same as how DEI has taken on a meaning apart from what the abbreviation stands for. It's why people say that when someone is against DEI policies to tell them to use the whole term so everyone can hear what they're *really* against.",JohnSober7,2025-05-09T19:16:40,1
"I respect your honesty as well.  You're are right, they can be described as ""tastes"" of a particular perspective in a rudimentary way.  There is no universal truth ledger to distinguish them as the 'correct' or 'incorrect' way to be. What makes you think there is higher moral reference? Higher than ourselves? I guess in that lies your faith.   Love and connection can still be true, a true means to an end goal of connecting with the universe (again not a moral  universal truth, but one as seen from my perspective, as someone who seeks connection and love)  ""Hope without foundation ... is just projection"" is how I would describe all religion. Including pragmatistic pantheism. Hope in an afterlife we have no evidence of, hope of a higher power larger than ourselves we have no evidence of. Hope in the innate attraction towards unity ('goodness' in the Christian sense) of the spirit in the face of boundless evidence against any such claim.   I respect your belief that love and moral truth come from ""beyond us"". I just don't accept there IS a beyond us. If it comes from something larger than us (human 'us'), to me, that is a property of the universe and consciousness.  I'll leave you with this example. Say there is a village where a mother cares for her newborn. If a Tiger comes and takes her child to feed her own cubs, is the Tigger evil? From the Trigger's perspective (a lower state for consciousness than ours) she is doing 'good' to feed her cubs. But she destroys the human mother's soul in the process, the Tigger does not understand her impact on the human mother, her perspective only drives her to care for her cubs. We, as humans know that we do harm to the animals we eat, and by the way we treat them. And that has a spiritual weight to it that is our burden (shout out to Vegans). This is not to justify behavior that benefits your family or community at the expense of others, as that also carries a spiritual weight to it, especially if it is done under false pretenses.

"I appreciate your thoughtful reply, and I think we’ve reached the heart of the divide.  You admit these values, love, connection, compassion, are not universal truths, but personal or communal “tastes.” Yet you still speak of them as if they carry weight beyond yourself. You even describe actions as carrying “spiritual weight,” as if there’s some real, binding moral consequence.  But here’s the tension: either morality is real or it isn’t. If it’s just perspective, then there’s no such thing as spiritual weight, only psychological reactions shaped by evolution, culture, or preference. Yet you describe harm, empathy, and consciousness in ways that imply they actually matter, not just feel significant. That’s the contradiction.  You ask, “What makes you think there is a higher moral reference?” The answer is simple: **coherence**. Without a higher reference point, all values are flattened. Nothing is truly good or evil. A tiger killing a child and a human loving one are both just behavior. If that’s all it is, then any moral language we use is window dressing, poetic survival code.  But you don’t actually live that way. You describe real moral burdens, real compassion, real reverence for life. **That means you’re borrowing from a framework you say you reject.** You live as if certain things are truly better, even sacred, but you deny any foundation that could make them so.  You say you don’t believe there is a “beyond us.” But then you appeal to something larger than individual perspective, a cosmic consciousness, a spiritual weight, a higher state of awareness. **That’s not disbelief in the beyond. That’s naming it something else.**  Here’s the key difference: **I believe truth is not just what works, or what feels meaningful. I believe truth is what is, whether I like it or not.** That’s why I trust in a God who exists independent of me, and who grounds morality, love, and personhood in something objective, something eternal.  You say “this is my own truth.” But truth, if it’s real, can’t be private. That’s preference. Real truth transcends the self. If love, compassion, and dignity are more than moods, if they mean something, they have to be grounded in something more real than we are.  Otherwise, they’re just echoes in the void.

"You argue that without a transcendent, objective moral source... like God.... values like love, dignity, and compassion are ultimately meaningless, just biochemical preferences. That is a powerful critique, but it rests on a false dichotomy: that either morality is grounded in an eternal, outside authority, or it’s an illusion.  But there’s a third way: #personal# morality can be real, even sacred, without being absolute in the theistic sense.  In pragmatic pantheism, the universe itself is devine... not a person or lawgiver, but a creative, evolving totality. Consciousness, empathy, and unity emerge within it as real phenomena... not arbitrary, but rooted in the structure of interconnection. When I speak of “spiritual weight,” I don’t mean some floating, cosmic ledger of sin and virtue. I mean: some actions really do deepen the fabric of life, while others diminish it. TO ME it is not mere taste—it is a reflection of how things actually are in a relational cosmos.  You say that if moral truths aren’t eternal, they’re just noise. But eternity doesn’t make something meaningful... relation does. A mother’s love for her child is not made less real because it evolved or because it ends when they die. It is real because of its effect, its resonance, its felt presence. Same with justice, awe, and compassion.  You suggest I’m borrowing from your framework. I would say you’re projecting yours onto mine. You think value must come from outside... but what if it arises from within? What if the sacred is not above or beyond, but here, now, pulsing in the aliveness of things?  And coherence? I agree, it matters. But coherence doesn’t require a divine lawgiver... it requires alignment with reality. And reality, as I experience it, is not indifferent. It births stars and trees and minds capable of love and grief. That’s not random. That’s meaningful.  You believe in truth beyond yourself. So do I. But I believe it’s woven into the univers, not imposed from outside it.  That is not an “echo in the void.” It is a song, sung by the cosmos to itself, and heard by creatures like us who can give it voice.  That's all I have to say on the matter, thanks for stimulating conversation.

"Thank you again for your thoughtful reply. I think this has been a rich conversation, and I respect your clarity and sincerity.  You describe a view where the universe is sacred in itself, not through a transcendent lawgiver, but as a kind of living, relational whole. In that view, morality arises from the structure of interconnection, and actions carry spiritual weight by how they impact the fabric of life.  I hear you. And I agree: some things resonate. Some actions feel like they deepen the world. Others cheapen it. I don’t deny that your framework can be moving, even noble. What I’m pressing on is not the beauty of your outlook, but the ground beneath it.  Because resonance alone isn’t the same as truth. Harm can resonate. Love can resonate. So can manipulation, tribalism, and euphoric delusion. Something can feel meaningful and still be false. So the real question is: what makes something true?  You say eternity doesn’t make something meaningful, relation does. But relation is only meaningful if the things being related have real, enduring value. A mother’s love is beautiful, yes. But is it good in itself, or just evolutionarily beneficial? If the universe is indifferent at the base, and love just arises, then it may feel sacred, but it isn’t truly sacred. It’s just effective chemistry.  That’s the difference between a God who is love and a cosmos that occasionally generates it. One is foundation. The other is event.  I’m not projecting my framework. I’m asking if yours can bear its own weight. Because your words, love, compassion, dignity, spiritual weight, point to realities that seem to demand more than perspective. They seem to want permanence. They seem to want truth.  You say reality is not random. I agree. But what makes that meaning binding? If we are to treat others with reverence, why? Not what makes it feel good, but what makes it right?  I don’t believe morality is imposed from outside. I believe it flows from the source of being. And if that source is personal, relational, and eternal, then love and goodness are not just emergent, they are real, even when we fail to see them.  That is why I trust God. Not to comfort me. But because only in Him do truth and meaning actually hold.  And yes, it’s a song. But I believe it is not the cosmos singing to itself. It is creation responding to a voice that called it into being.  He is closer to me than I am to myself.   -St. Augustine",Key-Item8266,2025-05-09T18:57:09,1
