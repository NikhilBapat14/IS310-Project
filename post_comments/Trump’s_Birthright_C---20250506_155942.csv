Why does it even matter how the government's lawyer is inept?   If the Roberts Court respected the 14th Amendment he wouldn't have taken up this case. He and his collaborators are obviously planning to subvert or possibly kill birthright citizenship.,ZebraImaginary9412,2025-05-06T18:41:16,2

"SCOTUS just has to look at half of the world and their birthright citizenship laws and yeah, that half follows blood line or some mix of the two. Ironically, I’d have a coworker going back to Sweden of all places since his dad isn’t from the US.  Buuuut…doing that to everyone that’s here now and trying to deport them…is it even worth the overall cost?",[deleted],2025-05-06T19:02:05,1

I think you miss understand.   Birthright citizenship will still be granted to people their mother is a citizen.    The executive orders wasn't to end all birthright citizenship.  Just stop birthright citizenship for people born on our soil if their mom is not a citizen.,not_a_moogle,2025-05-06T18:12:05,1

"Hes grandfathered in. The EO specifically said it woyld only apply to people born 30 days after the order, which would have been 2/28/25.  Which is really dumb, cause then those kids have no citizenship.

The EO doesn't really cover this.  I'm assuming the child is still not a citizen and would have to apply for naturalization. So a parent wouldn't automatically get a green card.,not_a_moogle,2025-05-07T10:16:41,1
