The ICE agents who illegally arrested him should be locked up and fired.,BukkitCrab,2025-05-09T20:21:17,90
This was an illegal arrest designed to put fear into protesters.  Ideology   Compliance   Enforcement,SnootSnootBasilisk,2025-05-09T20:26:19,62
The performance arrest is complete. Just how the German SA started out in the 1930s.,williamgman,2025-05-09T20:32:07,31
I hope other mayors follow this courageous example. I hope citizens organize to make these arrests much more dangerous for the Gestapo.,Marxian_factotum,2025-05-09T21:04:44,17
"I hope all the people who have been subjected to this kind of egregious arrest and detention - and firings, for that matter - will be suing the gov.",MJcorrieviewer,2025-05-09T20:40:27,13
"Just a matter of time, arrests like this wonâ€™t return the person back, at least not in one piece or alive.  This is getting better and better. /s",Intelligent_Teach247,2025-05-09T21:33:33,7

Abolish ICE.,Instant_Ad_Nauseum,2025-05-10T01:03:52,5
"Remember when wearing a mask a few years ago was considered the government stomping on civil liberties and freedom by Republicans, but now that ICE is doing it, it's totally acceptable even though they're actually stomping on people's civil liberties and freedoms.  You know what they say about Republicans, without the double standards, they'd be left with no standards at all.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-10T07:34:24,3
Has there been any details on what the interference actually was?,Objective_Aerie_2830,2025-05-09T21:21:49,5
I hope this shows the state he gives a damn and helps him win governor,Lunchb0xx87,2025-05-10T05:49:02,1
"No problem, but we need to know who the agents were SPECIFICALLY.  What agency were they with? What was the agents BADGE NAME AND NUMBER? How tall was the agent? What color hair did they have? What color eyes? Approximately how much did they weigh within 5 lb? Without ALL the above information, WE CAN NOT process your claim and advise you to get ALL this information in the future should this ever occur again before attempting to file a complaint.   The Trump Administration",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T20:39:29,38
Here are some words so I don't say what I'm thinking. I'm going to think it though.,notbadhbu,2025-05-09T23:43:29,7

"Ja, das stimmt. But we will be rolling out the SS and the Gestapo very soon.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T20:42:11,9
I hope the mayor purges the nypd of these Nazis and puts out incentives to attract people who will fight for and protect people from these fascists,Mokyzoky,2025-05-10T13:24:35,1

3 counts of Talking While Black. 1 count of Resisting Arrest While Black.,space_for_username,2025-05-09T21:44:33,14
"Thatâ€™s a nuanced and rational perspective, donâ€™t do that here.",lastminu,2025-05-09T21:48:38,-12
"Yes, this needs be public information. We need to know first/last name and badged number. They need to be added a list of persons committing felonies including kidnapping and human trafficking.",TheCommonGround1,2025-05-09T22:56:33,11
That sounds like the beginning of due process... why should the trump administration be granted that. Just need our own illegal org to start kidnapping ICE agents. I call on gomer pile to make citizen arrests.,Runny_Runs,2025-05-10T08:22:20,2
Reading a little too much into it?  Sounds like you're a Nazi now.  That's how it works when you don't stand up  when Nazis do Nazi shit.  This is America and the ICE gestapo can get fucked.  And anyone who disagrees is a traitor.,PlanktonUnusual328,2025-05-09T22:13:10,30
expecting to see this comment in r/agedlikemilk.,entrepenurious,2025-05-10T00:39:26,5
That's what they said the last time.   6 million plus people weren't murdered because everyone was a bigot. They were murdered because people looked the other way and insisted those who were warning them were  exaggerating.,SicilyMalta,2025-05-10T06:27:31,3
ICE arguably is the same organization as the gestapo from its inception. Itâ€™s just had many external restrictions put on it until now.,ultimatemuffin,2025-05-09T23:21:24,6
Go lick ICE boots elsewhere.,Rebuild6190,2025-05-09T22:04:42,13
Traitorous scum.,PlanktonUnusual328,2025-05-09T22:14:45,6
This thread appears to be Republicans that think they are Democrats.   What he did or didn't do matters because the government kinda has jurisdiction over immigration.Â    States don't have to assist but they cannot interfere.,Objective_Aerie_2830,2025-05-09T23:39:17,-4
Some law enforcement dude  made a pc arrest  and people are acting like this is the doing of the trump adminâ€¦ itâ€™s like saying some state police dude arrests someone in the moment for whatever  and now this is the governors doing ðŸ˜‚,lastminu,2025-05-09T22:53:30,-21
Ya youâ€™re right man this arrest came straight from the top ðŸ˜‚ they got the president on the line for this one,lastminu,2025-05-10T00:41:06,0

No it's Nazis in an ICE costume doing what their Nazi boss wants them to do   And now it's being sugarcoated by their Nazis on the Internet.  That's what you are.  A fucking Nazi.,PlanktonUnusual328,2025-05-09T23:06:31,17
Maybe not the president but someone about two ranks below a cabinet member. No way this person would have been released so quickly if it was a standard procedureÂ ,JollyToby0220,2025-05-10T08:51:28,2
