"Each time he is putting someone down with nasty name calling, he is deflecting.  Reference - sleepy Joy, is really sleepy Dump.  You get the idea. He calls the name out before someone calls it to him. Along with this, you have Megas who are incredibly thin skinned, they kiss his ring in fear of being called something nasty.

If democrats get their sorry butts in the media and call him out every single day, the republicans will see that it can be done.",Alternative_Gate4158,2025-05-10T16:12:15,2
