"It’s a political action. The rules of evidence or procedure are at best loosely filed, and not required at all. The jury of senators are free to state before the trial how they wish to vote or their views on the guilt or innocence of the respondent. The rules of evidence or procedure simply aren’t applicable in these situations.   The Senate can choose to set the rules as they wish.   I see no point in following strictly to these rules.",Ornery-Ticket834,2025-03-17T10:35:22,15
"Since there needs to be Articles of Impeachment for the Senate to vote on, the House would probably need formal statements backed up by evidence confirming their statements.  An impeachment can be for criminal activity or political maladministration, so the rules of evidence are probably not as strict as they would need to be in a courtroom.",mdws1977,2025-03-17T10:36:48,7
"Rules haven't saved us, and probably won't save us. We need elected officials to act with integrity and a genuine eye toward the public interest. Unfortunately we don't seem to value integrity enough, and this Congress lacks it. Voting matters. Or at least it did matter.",RickWolfman,2025-03-17T11:59:16,3
"Either way, the presiding officer (the Chief Justice in cases involving the president, and the Vice President in all other cases) will have discretion when resolving procedural disputes. And their is no appeal from the Senate's verdict.",Fluffy-Load1810,2025-03-17T12:31:07,2
"Impeachment is not the same as a criminal trial. The standards for removal from office do not require a crime having been committed. This is why an impeached official can *still be prosecuted for crimes* relating to the issue they were impeached over, which was the course of events that American framers of the impeachment process envisioned.  (It's also why the Constitution does not prohibit charging elected officials with crimes and putting them on trial for those crimes *while in office* \- the avoidance of putting sitting officials on trial is a matter of US Justice Department policy, not established law.)",Piriper0,2025-03-17T17:37:44,2
"Impeachment is a political act entirely, so ridged rules do not apply beyond what is in the constitution",IntrepidAd2478,2025-03-17T13:28:40,1
I think you can be impeached for picking your nose if you can get enough support in congress. But whether that is worth being removed from office is a separate issue with higher scrutiny.   Either way there are no rules but what you make up.,JustRuss79,2025-03-18T03:19:35,1
"An impeachment is a political procedure with legal ramifications. As it should be. Ultimately, power resides with the people. The people's will is reflected in our elected representatives. Hence, our elected representatives should not be bound by cumbersome rules of evidence or procedure.  If an elected official is impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate . . . That is it. The safeguard, in a robust democracy, is the political ramification of those representatives of the people who vote one way or another.",neosituation_unknown,2025-03-18T15:26:43,1

"I don't think ""political maladministration"" would be a sufficient predicate for impeachment.  Article II § 4 states that only ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" provide the proper basis for impeachment.",Private_Gump98,2025-03-17T10:55:50,1

"Hard to show they made war on the US or adhered to its armed opponents. Especially given that they were blatantly obviously doing this before the election and the citizenry either voted for them or abstained in large enough numbers to let him win.   There are better things to charge them with.   Incidentally, it actually would make sense in Denmark to charge someone with treason as their constitution does declare a violent attack on Parliament to be treason.",Awesomeuser90,2025-03-26T11:27:09,1
"The key phrase there is ""high crimes and misdemeanors"".  That's a specific turn of phrase in English common law from the time the Constitution was written: it's crimes committed uniquely by those in positions of power, it's abuse of that power.  Linking the whole Wikipedia article, but it's worth a read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors#:~:text=%22High%20crimes%20and%20misdemeanors%22%20is,war%27%20and%20%27due%20process.  Maladministration would absolutely be covered under high crimes and misdemeanors.",link3945,2025-03-17T12:31:40,6
"Remember, the GOP House impeached President Clinton over a BJ. Certainly not a ""high crime"" and is never prosecuted as a crime. Clinton did lie about a BJ in a civil trial.  In a civil trial, one side is always lying. ""Your dog bit me"", the other says ""it wasn't my dog"". One side is lying and the remedy is an award of damages. Nobody is ever charged for lying in a civil trial. That was enough for the GOP to impeach a President.  (I did find one case of lying in a civil trial being prosecuted, it was an expert witness who was found to be lying about his credentials in multiple trials, causing their rulings to be suspect.)",billpalto,2025-03-17T12:02:17,-1
I think your post asks whether FRCP-like rules or simply good faith should dictate impeachment proceedings. Perhaps I misread it. Just trying to add to the discussion.,RickWolfman,2025-03-17T12:38:01,1
"I agree with you, but I would qualify it by saying it depends on the kind of maladministration.  Negligence, abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and perjury resulting in maladministration? Yes.  But OC said ""*political* maladministration"", which to me indicated a kind of maladministration related to a political position... but upon rereading, I can see he probably just meant something that doesn't rise to the level of a crime. If that's the case then yes, impeachment can be used for things that aren't crimes for anyone else because of the nature of the office.",Private_Gump98,2025-03-17T12:36:30,1
"Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice, not a blowjob. Both are crimes.  And no... lawsuits are not always ""one side lying"" lol (source, I am an attorney). It's way more often about entitlement, litigating defenses, interpretation of contract/law, and determining the appropriate amount of money damages or another remedy.  People are charged with perjury frequently. And if they're not charged with perjury, they're often held in contempt, sanctioned/fined, etc. as a punishment in lieu of a criminal conviction if the Judge/Prosecutor use their discretion in that way.",Private_Gump98,2025-03-17T12:07:07,5
"Meanwhile, the current President has been found to be a fraud, a liar, a sexual predator, and a convicted felon in several courts and yet he is not impeached.  Obviously, impeachment is not based on committing a crime or lying.",billpalto,2025-03-19T07:57:13,1
"And yet, Clinton was never charged with any crimes. That shows that crimes are not required for impeachment, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one.",billpalto,2025-03-17T12:08:58,-2
"Right... because he was a sitting President and you cannot indict a sitting President with a crime, you impeach them for it.   That is the legal process laid out in the constitution, the supreme law of the land.  Articles of impeachment are literally ""charging"" a sitting president with a crime in the only way recognized by the Constitution. The only difference is that upon ""conviction"" by the Senate (do you just think they use this term for no reason?), instead of being given a sentence, you are removed from office.",Private_Gump98,2025-03-17T12:10:06,3
"Also, an impeachment is a process to remove someone from power, not to put them in prison or take their stuff. To get enough evidence to justify putting someone on trial and then convicting them is a difficult thing. Impeachment doesn't have a set level of evidence needed for conviction by the Senate.",Awesomeuser90,2025-03-17T13:31:25,1
"The crime was perjury, not a blowjob.  The crime was serious enough where Clinton had to settle with the DOJ before he left office to avoid prosecution.  He should have been removed from office.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-03-18T07:32:12,1
