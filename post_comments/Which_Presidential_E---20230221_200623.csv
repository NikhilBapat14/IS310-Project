"9/11 defined the modern geo-political landscape for most of the 21st century so far.   I imagine having Al Gore in office instead of Bush would've led us into a much different looking world.   The War on Terror would've either never happened or been different. Maybe the US never would have invaded Iraq.  *edit: I'm not implying a Gore adminstration never would've went to war had 9/11 occurred under their watch - just that it may have played out very differently. Or not - the big players in the defense and oil industries still might've lured the US military to a prolonged conflict in the Middle East regarless of who was in office.*   On the other hand a different political atmosphere between 00-08 could mean we never saw a candidate Obama.   If there never was an Obama presidency, the more racist roots of the Tea Party and eventually Trumpism wouldn't have been a factor. That isn't to say there wouldn't have been a grassroots conservative response to liberals in power during those years.   You can speculate all day about this and there's ramifications everywhere you look, but I think 9/11 and the response by the administration in power played the biggest role in answering your question.  *edit: clarified a point under the War on Terror.*",geraltseinfeld,2023-02-24T09:36:17,4
"Both losses were bad.  One was to near steal the election because the supreme court stopped the Florida recount.  The other was that a woman with 3 million more votes was not elected because of electoral college.  Probably the world and America would be very different, the polarity would not be so much.  I don't think there will be a difference in terms of inflation and economy.",stefanlucius,2023-02-25T04:12:04,3
"Pretty hard to say in the long run, both elections were heavily impactful on the world, and it’s hard to say what would change if Al Gore was president during 9/11, or what would happen if Clinton was president during Covid.",Phantom78611,2023-04-10T16:03:25,1
"Important to note the first drone strikes, first attacks, and first Al Qaeda operations were in the Gore administration. That Cuba is extraterritorial as an argument was from the Clinton DOJ’s understanding of Haitian refugees. Would the war have been very different?",[deleted],2023-02-24T10:43:51,2
> I imagine having Al Gore in office instead of Bush would've led us into a much different looking world.  Keep in mind that Bush was the isolationist while Gore was the interventionist. So it's likely the War on Terror we got was far more restrained than the one we would have gotten under Gore.,ViskerRatio,2023-02-26T05:00:27,1
"> One was to near steal the election because the supreme court stopped the Florida recount.  A variety of media outlets ran an analysis after the fact and concluded that had the recount not been stopped, the outcome would not have changed.  > The other was that a woman with 3 million more votes was not elected because of electoral college.  That same woman wasn't the 2008 Democratic nominee because she failed to appreciate the importance of various elements of the nominating process. Yet no one complains about how Obama 'stole' the 2008 Democratic nomination from her.  Complaining that you lost an election by the rules is a bit like complaining that you should have been given the victory in a football game because you had more yardage despite scoring less. It's always possible to find some arbitrary metric on which you 'won' - but the only metric that matters is the one that decides the outcome.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-26T05:04:34,0
