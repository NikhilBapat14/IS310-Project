"I sound like a broken record but we desperately need legislation, not executive orders to avoid crap like this because it's not going to end.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-08T14:49:30,29
"> Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). U.S. District Judge John McConnell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, sided with the states on Tuesday, affirming their arguments that the closings violated the separation of powers.  That’s why we need to be get throngs through congress. If we can’t get bills passed no change will last.",JackandFred,2025-05-08T07:23:04,50
It amazes me that out of almost 700 federal district judges that any could have multiple cases against the Trump administration. So much for cases being randomly assigned.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-08T08:08:27,28
Solution fire everyone from those agencies provided they fall under the executive branch but don’t close them down.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-08T08:10:25,13
If trump wants to disband 3 agencies he act fast before the midterms. While congress is controlled by republicans. Sadly I don’t think republicans will be able to win back control due the tariffs.,dotsdavid,2025-05-08T10:02:49,1
A new president would just bring them back. He needs congress to end them.,dotsdavid,2025-05-08T10:03:46,23
"> Sadly I don’t think republicans will be able to win back control due the tariffs.  About 110 days into the term, and you're already convinced we've lost. JFC, it's no wonder that even when the Right wins, they lose anyway.",somegaijin42,2025-05-08T10:12:59,15

"Trump is talking about kids having too many pencils, and you’re going to talk down to people for saying the tariffs were a misstep?",CamoAnimal,2025-05-08T10:22:48,24
"No, I'm going to talk down to people who declare the midterms a loss 18 months before the election even occurs, when the end results of said tariffs are yet to be seen.",somegaijin42,2025-05-08T11:16:45,5
"There are many things happening in the world for which we cannot be certain of the outcome. This isn’t one of those. When we exist in a global economy and the president suddenly tariffs everyone under the sun en masse, it is 100% certain to upset our allies and make everything more expensive. Anyone not living under a rock is painfully aware of this every time they reach the cash register and when they read international news articles.  In the eyes of voters, Trump’s single greatest quality was that he was going to “fix the economy” and help make life more affordable. Even immigration was a distant second issue by comparison. So, when the majority of voters show up at the ballot box for the midterm elections, do you really think the majority are going to say “yea, I want more of that”?  Seriously, this is why people accuse Trump’s base of being cult like. And, no. Despite voting for Trump all three times, I don’t consider myself his base.",CamoAnimal,2025-05-08T12:02:27,14
