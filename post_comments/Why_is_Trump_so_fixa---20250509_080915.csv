Feminized decadence (instead of manly self-reliance or whatever) is one of the oldest autocratic themes in the book.,Chazhoosier,2025-05-09T08:35:30,1399
"> The comments aim to cast the pain that consumers will face as ultimately feminine and frivolous, their complaints petulant and childlike. In this respect, Trump is drawing on a long tradition of economic rhetoric that aims to cast consumption as feminine, decadent and morally suspect – and to contrast it with the supposedly more manly and virtuous productive side of the economy. It’s a laughably stupid symbolism, one that only works for those deeply committed to their ignorance about how the economy actually works: in truth, everyone consumes, and people of all genders participate in the productive economy. But Trump does not argue based on the facts: he asserts dominance. And here, he casts those Americans who would complain about the economic pain that he is inflicting on them as feminine and hence as contemptible, deserving no more respect than spoiled children.  https://archive.is/wip/8GZlI",Zen1,2025-05-09T08:10:23,839

Because he said it once because his frozen-in-time sexist brain was looking for an example and that and pencils are somehow all he could think of.  His out-of-touch naturally exaggerating brain made the number 30.

">Howard Lutnick, a billionaire former CEO, went on MSNBC late last month to describe his vision for the future of the American worker. “It’s time to train people not to do the jobs of the past but to do the great jobs of the future,” Lutnick said, arguing that *fewer people should be aspiring to bachelor’s degrees* and should expect to occupy themselves in lower-skill factory work instead. “This is the new model, where you work in these kind of plants for the rest of your life, and your kids work here, and your grandkids work here.”  People don’t need that pesky bachelors degree to work on the line in factories to keep making widgets. No aspirations for higher education needed to achieve more in life. Kind of like Trump’s “I love the poorly educated”. No bachelor’s degree required for “lower-skilled factory work”.  Trump and dolls. He perseverates on particular ideas or things that he hears. Now, it’s dolls. Tomorrow, maybe it will be GI Joes but I doubt it. If part of their goal is to push women out of the work force and back to home and hearth in order to have those babies that no one can afford to have any longer; Trump’s administration truly knows nothing about what it takes to survive in America now.",R_Lennox,2025-05-09T09:49:56,1

He's fucken going after HARVARD for chrissakes. Because smart people, turns out, are people who threaten mob tactics.  Notice that he's NOT going after things like guns, coal, sugar, fast food, police, oil and gas.  Now they're actively going after the Catholic church, and my in-laws have fallen to it.  It's wild. They insisted I marry their son in the Catholic church and they sent all their kids to Catholic schools. But now they don't even go to mass anymore and now (according to my son who still speaks with them) they're actually complaining about the new Pope just because their favorite TV channel is all over it.  These are really people I realized I just do not know anymore.  What's that reference? Is it Star Trek?

"So, you don't think the people who make their living selling dolls (or more generally, ""useless junk"") are variables in the cost-benefit equation?  If a business has been created to serve the demand of local families who want to buy 30 dolls for each little girl in their clan, and suddenly those families considerably reduce their consumption, you don't think that business isn't going to have to layoff workers?  You don't think the truck drivers who would normally be distributing their inventory will be laid off? When that business closes, you don't think the town is going to suffer from lost sales taxes? You don't think the luncheonette next door will be negatively affected now that the toy store workers and truck drivers aren't grabbing breakfast and lunch anymore?  The prosperity of this country is built on useless junk.  Are you really saying that poverty is a better situation for us to be in than every little kid having an overflowing toy chest?   Or are you just parroting what our idiotic president is saying like a mindless bot? Need I remind you that Trump's wealth has been built on useless junk too. Trump steaks, Trump bibles, Trump fugly sneakers, Trump meme coins.  If people didn't waste money staying in overpriced hotels, he would be just a regular schlub.  Notice he isn't telling people to tighten their belts and limit their stay in fancy hotels to save money so they still support their local small businesses, because that would require him to think in a way that he has never done before---selflessly.  He has no problem telling you and me to be ready for sacrifice and pain, though.   He doesn't give a flying fuck about all the ""useless junk"" either. Republicans can try to gaslight us into thinking they have been the party of conservative consumption this whole time but it ain't working.

But sure, women donating old home goods and baby clothes to the thrift are super wasteful.",Stellaaahhhh,2025-05-09T10:24:58,26
"""Deeply committed to their ignorance of how the economy really works"" as the article says.  So, here's some fun facts for you:  We produce *far more* clothing than Americans can wear.  *Far* more.  So much that we've driven many small foreign clothiers that would otherwise supply their local regions out of business, because our cast-offs *flood* the poorer regions of the world.  You can *literally* find tribesmen living in grass huts wearing last year's American sports jerseys.  They are non-perishable, easy to ship, tax-tax-deductible as donations, and completely un-sellable if a team chances colors or players or numbers.  What winds up in American thrift stores is a tiny, *tiny* portion of the overall discarded clothing - the very few items that are deemed to be sellable to local poor people, rather than more cost-effective to crate up and ship off for the tax write-off of donating to the needy of other countries.  It, therefore, represents the absolute best of the best of discarded clothing.  The very few items that were, as you say, worn once - or even not at all.  Children's clothes purchased before a growth spurt or weather change, often with the tags still on.  Clothes purchased by a retired woman who thought she had years of cruises and fancy dinners ahead, but who instead had cancer.  Rare occurrences, but when you process literal *tons* of cast-off clothing, you find enough to stock a store.  It's also  really hard to take seriously the idea that re-use in a thrift store is a good example of ""how wasteful"" people are.  Even if you take out the pointless and unsubstantiated gendering of your comments.  After all, as pointed out above, thrift stores are spoiled for choice - what they stock isn't driven by supply, but by demand.  If the shelves overrun with women's clothing, it's because more women than men are re-using these clothes - being *less* wasteful than their male counterparts, in direct contradiction to your assumption.",TheFeshy,2025-05-09T10:27:46,20

"I’m not going to respond to your ad hominem on Trump. I’m not a supporter of his. I do have a degree in Econ so I can understand how tariffs will effect the economy. Toys that were manufactured here would be unaffected or boosted by tariffs. So the job losses you mention for producers would not be relevant to the U.S. And a lack of useless junk does not equate with poverty.  As for the distribution jobs: we need to recognize that not all jobs are created equal. Distribution jobs are not as valuable to the middle class as industrial/manufacturing jobs. To see this, look at the Gig economy, an extreme example of such distribution jobs. Workers are interchangeable and lack job security and unionization efforts are easily quashed (Teamsters is an exception). Production jobs have historically created greater prosperity for workers, and offered them dignity and security in their roles: they should be prioritized.  I think most Americans understand and agree with what I’ve written above, which is why the democratic party has failed to find support beyond affluent coastal cities as of late.",Head-Ad3805,2025-05-10T15:37:24,1
