I've held for a long time progressives should seriously look into Christian Socialism as an ideology for the more conservative areas. It simply uses Christianity to justify progressive and socialist policies.,Basileus_Ioannes,2025-04-05T07:46:31,6

"Christianity has never been a religion of love.  They have been repressing, abusing and murdering people for nearly 2000 years, and the Bible has always been used to justify harm to others.  The idea that Christianity is a religion of love is as mythical and nonsensical as the religion itself.",Candid_Photograph_83,2025-04-05T06:08:27,7

"Lmao, what? Y'all, this is delusional.  God was condemning people left and right. God was such a colossal asshole in the bible, that they had to do a rewrite and call it the new testament.  Even then, people were still condemned in the new testament. And the new testament is clear, god views homosexuality as a sin.   I think it's a good thing when a church accepts the LGBTQ. But people need to accept whats in that dusty old ass worthless text. Slavery is okay, gays are sinners, adulterers are sinners, women need to sit down, if you suspect your girl cheated you should force her to get an abortion. Kids laughing at bald men deserve to be devoured by bears.   Why anyone would still believe that trash is beyond me. It was nothing more than people trying to explain how we came to be, and how to live civilized. We don't need it anymore, it's time to move on.",personalKindling,2025-04-05T03:58:20,2

It's a faith of love. The religion part of it....you're correct. They've ruined the bible's message.,Queasy-Trip1777,2025-04-05T07:46:06,6
I think it's important to note that uh...Christ....like the guy the religion is named after....well he never once condemns homosexuality in the bible. But boy did he have a thing about divorce and people judging other people's sins.,Queasy-Trip1777,2025-04-05T07:45:11,3

"I'm not going to pretend to be a scholar. But Jesus supported the law, aka old testament. ""Mathew 5: 17 - 20"" makes it pretty clear Jesus did not support homosexuality. Here's a quote to save you the time from searching.   Mathew 5: 17-20 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.    Isiah 40:8 8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.   Love fulfills the law, just not that kind of love. In which ways do you see me as being wrong here? I'm asking in good faith.",personalKindling,2025-04-05T09:48:18,1
"Even in the bible, Jesus makes it pretty dang clear.  Matthew 22:36‚Äì40 (KJV): 36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 37  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.",just2commenthere,2025-04-05T07:43:49,3
"I think that God inherently is not a man or a woman. I think the pronoun anyone uses for God is allowed to work for their own interpretation of God. I use His, and no one else is wrong if hey say Hers or Theirs....and this is because I think God is the essence of love and the essence of love is God. I believe we were made in the image of God. I believe we were made in am image of love. I believe that Jesus came to affirm that message, and I do not believe that He would confine qualification of receiving his love and grace to two genders of one species in ALL of creation. I believe that love is universal, and it is the single greatest tool used to unify masses...and because of that, throughout history, religious organizations have used love as a eligibility criteria just to receive that very thing from God, and I think that's wrong.       I think that the existence of love in any form IS THE VERY PRESENCE OF GOD. I don't think that God cares what physical, and UNIMAGINABLY TEMPORARY biological forms our bodies take. If the spirit of someone in His infinite and eternal kingdom meets the spirit of another in His kingdom....and they grow and bond and find a way to nurture new life and are seeking to include God in their journey together....I find it impossible to believe that God would condemn this union of souls based on the earthly body we were given to spend the speck of dust among eternity that is our time on Earth.   I think God's Law has a pure intention, and I think it is twisted and warped to keep the masses in line. I think people think God is there to fear and to do the condemning.....but they forget that his primary purpose is the proliferation of love.",Queasy-Trip1777,2025-04-05T13:31:36,1
"I think people try to use the ""love your neighbor as you would love yourself"" line to ignore the law of the old testament. But it's literally right there, to follow the law and the prophets IS to love the Lord and IS how you love your neighbor as yourself. They basically go hand in hand.   This idea that jesus was some wild progressive needs to stop. There is no reason to lie about what the bible says, or to mischaracterize its intentions.",personalKindling,2025-04-05T14:56:19,3
"Okay. That's fine. It's not what the bible says, and that's okay. I was hoping you had a better understanding of the bible and could point to scriptures that refute the points made by the scriptures I pointed to.  You all can down vote me all you want. I'm just pointing out, you know, what the bible literally says.",personalKindling,2025-04-05T14:30:48,2
"Taking the bible at face value and only giving it a literal interpretation of it, is kind of missing the point of it entirely; but only from my angle. That doesn't mean its right or wrong. I believe the bible should be afforded as much critical thought as possible, and studied, and have context added to it, I think everyone has a responsibility to determine, for themselves, what God is trying to tell YOU specifically through the scripture. I dont think anyone should tell anyone else how to interpret the scripture. I think your way is okay for you, and my way is okay for me because at the end of the day, God is God.",Queasy-Trip1777,2025-04-05T14:53:27,1
"Okay, how do you interpret the letter and the spirit of the laws laid out? They're straightforward. When you read not to commit adultery, where is the ambiguity?  Yes, some books in the bible are poetic, symbolic. But some are also historical and literal. As far as I know, the law is historical, literal.",personalKindling,2025-04-05T15:42:41,2
"The ambiguity lies in the fact that I don't interpret a man loving another man, or a woman loving another woman as adulterous. That has never been one of the takeaways I get from reading the bible. The notion of unconditional love and humility toward everyone, even those you disagree with...to me is a massively more Christ-like message than ""The bible says this, so you're a sinner.""",Queasy-Trip1777,2025-04-05T19:56:38,1
