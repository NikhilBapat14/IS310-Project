"I would love nothing more for Trump to get a deal going with Britain. It would serve me greatly, personally, as there are several Motorsport companies that are highly regarded in their shores, and theyâ€™re businesses that I aspire to cooperate with later on in life for when I start my own shop.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-08T09:25:34,3

"What the fuck do you think? My stocks.  Our tariff rate on English goods, primarily. It's wildly incongruent to our needs as a nation. The uk is not fucking us over. They are not using slave labor. They are not geopolitically opposed to us. Why are we taxing them at over 5 times the rate they are taxing us, when previously they were only just barely beating us out by barely 2 times the rate? A very small rate, I might add. Their industry is not a threat to us in any way.   What the fuck at we gaining with this, really? What are we getting now that we weren't before?
