Condemning is good. Let’s see additional follow through,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-30T07:32:33,6
"What happened to - if you  follow the legal steps, Republicans will welcome immigrants?   This person was taken when he was in a meeting for his final step to becoming a US citizen. Next he knew, he was about to be boarded on a plane to a prison camp, when an injunction came through in time. Someone else took his place.   If his crime was speaking up, then what's to stop Trump from putting any of us in a camp? All of us on reddit who aren't in the Republican and Conservative subs will be next on that plane.    >Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, told NPR in an interview the outlet published Tuesday that he arrived at the appointment thinking it would be his final step to becoming a citizen after spending 10 years in the U.S.  >During Mahdawi’s appointment earlier this month, which was at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, the student affirmed his commitment to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign, and domestic,” according to court filings submitted by his attorneys.  >But afterward, an immigration official told Mahdawi he needed to “‘check’ on some information,” and “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled” Mahdawi, court filings state.  >The federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle and attempted to get him on a plane en route to Louisiana, his lawyers have said. But Mahdawi’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit, and a judge issued a temporary order to keep him in Vermont.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T07:36:12,5
That condemnation and $15 will buy you a cup of coffee (not insinuating that the condemnation is worth negative money. I just think that with the tariffs and inflation a cup of coffee will eventually cost this much.),Traditional-Wait-257,2025-04-30T13:01:46,2
The States don’t have a ton of power over immigration. It’s one of the reasons the idea of local police not helping ICE is so viable. The power of immigration enforcement rests solely with the Federal government.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-30T08:18:00,3
And the price of penguin eggs is now astronomical.   Apparently the president believes we voted for the destruction of our nation.,SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T13:10:50,1
