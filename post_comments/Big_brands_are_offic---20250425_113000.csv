"The most ridiculous rise has been in this like chips, especially Frito-Lay products like Doritos. 5, 6, or even 7(!) dollars a bag is outright highway robbery. We're talking 200 to 300 grams of potato or corn with some spices thrown in. Its been this way for several years now, too.  I only buy chips at Costco now, because for the same price I can get an actual pound of chips for 7 bucks or so.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T11:47:53,26
"One huge point the article didn’t address is consumers who can have been doubling up on staples, clothing, home appliances etc in preparation for price spikes that are only weeks away. This might ironically mislead analysts and pundits in thinking nothing bad is impending.

"A large majority of Americans are preparing for the recession that Orange Moselini is bringing with his idiotic tarrif war and policy of ending strategic partnerships with  former allies.   Tarrifs are raising prices, people are cutting back on unnecessary and discretionary spending to have money for essentials. The govt is putting those with delinquent student debt into poverty with check garnishment.   Lastly, give it a few more weeks to months, stores are going to be empty. Right now businesses have inventory that came in pre-tarrif, and mid tarrif on boat, or stuck with orders they committed to that they will lose money on because tarrifs.    So many businesses have stopped importing consumer goods from China. The business environment in America is too unstable. Importers and small businesses are scared.  This type of autocratic shit is from Putins play book. Business owners will sell their souls bending the knee propagating Trump because it's that and survive, or go under having principles/being apolitical.  It'll be pandemic bad, but much worse because we allowed a purchased and disgraced president to  return to power to openly taunt dictatorship, arresting judges, wishing to deport American citizens without due process.",maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-25T11:57:42,36

"I mean they participate in and benefit from society like the rest of us so they actually do owe us something. Usually that's supposed to come in the form of taxes.

"I think one silver lining is this has driven me to look at alternative products that didn't have the same brand name pull. I've actually found really good alternatives, like Utz for chips (though even they are getting a bit expensive for my liking), or Saladitas for saltine crackers instead of Nabisco Premium.  You can get better quality at lower prices if you're willing to try different brands out that don't have the brand name premium attached to them. It does sometimes mean you end up with an inferior product, but you only have to make that mistake once or twice before you can find solid alternatives.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T12:13:40,8
My spending has gone up - I'm trying to avoid paying a premium for things I will need in the next 1-2 years. But that's only so long as I can get something at pre-trade war pricing. It's very temporary and will lead towards even less spending in the future.,CockBrother,2025-04-25T12:20:40,11

"Oh yeah. Manager at a grocery store. Chips are 6.99, big brand soda is 9.99 a 12 pack and 2.99 a 2 liter. Cookies have gone up, dishwasher pods are reducing quantity by 4 while maintaining the same price point, and other profucts are spiking price all over the place.    Just looking at soda, we barely move units at buy 2, get 1 free, then can't keep the shelves stocked at buy 2, get 3 free. Soda may be a frivolous purchase, but people are very much holding back buying until the big sales.    Hell, this is the first year I can remember where we still had mountains of egg coloring kit stock on Easter. Usually we're wiped out a week or two before the holiday.   Pricing is wild out there right now, and it's not getting any better in the foreseeable future.",reflecttcelfer,2025-04-25T12:35:25,12
"Utz has always been solid.  I usually get their crab chips, which is just old bay seasoning.  I also have no issue about getting store brand stuff, as long as the quality is mostly on par with whatever brand.    But Costco has been great for just getting bulk if whatever it is is on sale further from their own price, and whatever I get from them tends to last me 1-2 months.",metalkhaos,2025-04-25T13:16:38,2
