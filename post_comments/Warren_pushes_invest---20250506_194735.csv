I assume the trump boys just don't care about laws because they assume their dad will pardon them on the way out if we still have the kind of republic where the people can select a replacement.  Bit of a bold gamble a surprise cheeseburger to the aorta won't put him out of commission before that and that JD Vance will put his neck out to save them if they are wildly unpopular.,08mms,2025-05-06T20:43:42,24

"The report that The Daily put out is pretty damning stuff. Using his influence on the markets to pump his crypto coin, using his power to position his crypto bank to make tons and tons of money, selling the tokens for face to face meetings so anyone can buy his personal attention? That's all pretty clear cut corruption stuff. It should be easily impeachable, and we the people should be putting people in office who are willing to acknowledge the truth regardless of whether or not their leader tells them not to.  If we aren't in full reverse ASAP, the country is going to fall apart pretty quickly.",BLU3SKU1L,2025-05-07T03:45:03,3

"This is called ""accepting the premise of assholes"".  Investigating the source of the funds for people buying the crypto meme coins is all well and good, but it also legitimizes that Trump is allowed to do it in the first place, even if only domestically.  They should be attacking this at the root, and saying that by launching a meme coin and driving business to his own companies and that of his friends, Trump is behaving corruptly and using the presidency for personal gain.  Of course, with immunity granted by SCOTUS, the only available remedy is impeachment, and the republican-controlled legislature will simply never impeach Donald Trump ever, even if he murdered a guy in Times Square in broad daylight.",CarbonFiberCactus,2025-05-07T12:04:57,2

We need oversight and investigations with Kelly Ayotte here in NH. She just signed an order to use Taxpayer money in our state to be used in Cryptocurrency investments. I really believe she’s going to purchase Trump meme coins to make her handler more money. She’s definitely going to be communicating with his group when to buy and sell.  Edit: I also believe the news yesterday that the House speaker in our state announced an investigation into our state university because he believes the university is harboring illegals is just a distraction from Ayotte’s criminal actions.,kamikaziboarder,2025-05-07T06:10:33,1
