"There are two primary lenses to look at this, a moral one and a realpolitik one.  The moral one answers the ethical question of the goodness inherent in an act. The second answers the question of power advantage.   From an ethical standpoint, minus the question of loan terms, this is a good thing for the African continent which needs capital to develop.   From a realpolitik standpoint, China believes it has much to gain by developing influence in the region and I believe this to be true. Through its lack of a colonial past, China enters Africa with less skepticism than (white) western powers and is able to develop favorable relationships with many African nations though its unrestricted initiatives. This relationship improves its access to raw materials, and forms closer ties with a part of the world expected to develop significantly this century (dubbed,  ""The Century of Africa"").   China knows it will be the world's strongest power as a matter of course, and they not only have many enemies and threats but must develop friendly ties and allies for support. Others here far better versed than me may speak more to the geopolitical advantage gained at such minor cost to China, but it is certainly a small price to pay for the support.",gomi-panda,2023-01-13T02:00:25,2
