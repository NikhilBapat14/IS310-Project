You could argue that if he's not constitutionally allowed to run again then he's not eligible to hold that office or you could argue that if he's not elected to the office of president it's still constitutional.

"A lot of people here are saying that 'No, he can't run in 2028 because of the 22nd Amendment.' This is not entirely true, as there is ambiguity in the way that the 22nd Amendment is written.  The 22nd Amendment states that a person cannot be *elected* President more than twice (or once if they have served the majority of someone else's term). The 12th Amendment outlines the eligibility of the VP - it's the same as President. However, it should be noted that the 22nd Amendment doesn't explicitly change eligibility to *be* President, only to be *elected* President - and it is clearly not necessary to be elected President to *become* President (see: Ford, G). So it's basically unclear whether or not the 22nd Amendment actually prevents someone from serving as President through succession instead of election. Ultimately, it would have to be decided by SCOTUS or it would be up to Congress to clarify it via amending the Constitution. There's even a blurb on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Interaction_with_the_Twelfth_Amendment).  Anyway, this ultimately doesn't matter for two reasons. Firstly, Trump's ego wouldn't allow himself to run as VP, even as a wink-nod type thing - he *has* to be the star of the show. The second thing is he doesn't care about the Constitution or laws - he's been allowed to do whatever he wants for his entire life. If he wants to run for a third term, he's just going to run for a third term, and if you think *that* will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for the GOP in Congress and his voters, well, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn. He will just declare victory in the 2028 election, not recognize the real results of the election, and set up a slate of fake electors for JD Vance to sign off on. And we will be back to the 2020 election shenanigans just like that, but with 4 years of planning instead of 4 weeks.",thewerdy,2025-03-20T08:02:17,0

Thanks to a single comma.  The 12th and 22nd Amendments are incredibly clear, though.  There's no wiggle room for interpretation.

An amendment is where the federal government makes a change to the constitution. Every amendment is part of the constitution of the United States.  A lot of the government process are governed by norms and traditions. The tradition of presidential terms was set by George Washington. He held office of president for 2 terms then did not run a third time. His position was one man shouldn’t hold the power for that long. Every president who was elected twice afterwards held this belief and chose not to run a third time. The exception was FDR. Roosevelt ran a third time because he was good, and the people loved him. The 22nd amendment was ratified to cement the founding father’s wishes.  Jefferson once wrote that he thought the presidency should be for only one 7 year term. He caved on this as he saw midway through the term, giving the people a voice to the continuance, a choice if they still wanted the president in place, was a good compromise to one 7 year term.  It’s 8 years as president. You can be vice president and become president when the president dies, hold office for 4 years, but then you can only serve one more term if you are elected.

"I strongly doubt they would intentionally promote Trump from Speaker to President for a couple reasons.  One - If our elections remain free and fair there would be no way to guarantee the Republicans will maintain a majority in the house. They wouldn't spend a whole election cycle hedging their bets on something that flimsy  Two- The optics would be unmanageable. The optics of any of these moves are bad but if you take someone who's not even a current elected representative and elect them Speaker just to have the elected President and Vice president step down then there's no way to fool enough of the population into believing that that was a fair election.  However, if they promoted him from VP his name would be on the presidential ticket so they could play it off by saying ""the people knew who they were voting for"" or ""they knew there was the possibility he could end up as president""  Beyond that, they have a super majority in the Supreme Court. There is the possibility that they could approve the loophole that I previously pointed out thus making the whole thing constitutional.

"1. Proposal by Congress: A proposed amendment must be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Alternatively, two-thirds of the state legislatures can request that Congress call a constitutional convention to propose amendments.   2. Ratification by the States: Once proposed, the amendment is sent to the states for ratification.  Congress determines whether the states will ratify the amendment through their legislatures or by conventions.  Legislatures: Three-fourths of the state legislatures must ratify the amendment.  Conventions: Three-fourths of state conventions must ratify the amendment.  Only one amendment (the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition) was ratified by conventions That’s it. Yes it’s a little hard.  ……  3. Executive/ judicial translation of an already existing amendment.   The Supreme Court interprets law. They set the standard for what the written laws actually mean, and how the law operates. There was a recent executive order by Trump changing birthright citizenship to mean that both parents had to be citizens and you had to be born in the United States to be a citizen. The 14th amendment states everyone born here is a citizen.  “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  The EO uses the phrase “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to mean that because the parents are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, they can not produce offspring within the United States who will automatically be United States citizens.  The EO was paused by judges and is currently making its way to The Supreme Court. They could potentially deside that Trumps interpretation is law. And bam, changed the constitution.   There is a commity that is attempting to change the interpretation of the 22nd to mean no one can hold office of president for 2 consecutive terms. But really all this interpretation can lead to no more guns, but everyone can have bare arms, so it’s bullshit but people can do whatever they want unless they are stopped.   The pen is mightier than the sword when there are swords behind the pen. The trick is to have your swords behind the pen.",joejill,2025-03-20T08:03:24,5

"You are assuming that 5 of the right wing Supreme Court justices won’t employ originalism in interpreting the 12th amendment, passed in 1804, in Trump’s favor. They could decide that the 12th amendment merely imposes on the vice president the Constitution’s other criteria at the time it was passed for presidential eligibility, namely that they be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years of age and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years. Such a ruling is a real possibility for three reasons: first, right wing justices have already bent over backwards to help Trump with their criminal immunity ruling; second, they will be terrified that they will be assassinated by the MAGA hordes a la Mike Pence on J6; third, they might prefer Trump gets reinstalled as President if the elected President is even more unhinged, e.g. Donald Trump Jr.",minimus67,2025-03-20T11:37:27,5

"It’s all about the vote man.  Trumps recent EO makes it so you need a passport or federally recognized picture ID to vote.   A few states that don’t have that will have more than a few voters show up to polls without the proper ID or have recently gotten married so the names won’t match.  My NY drivers license isn’t a “real ID” so not for federal purposes. Ie voting.  I’m not sure how NY is handling this EO, and I do have a passport I’ll bring with me, but not everyone does.

"Correct, we have representatives who vote.  We vote for our representatives.  Voter turnout tends to be both higher and more stable among older, white voters. These demographics are more reliably conservative. Voter turnout among young voters, minorities, and the poor tend to be both lower and unequally impacted by outside influences, including voter suppression tactics, voting dates, and even the weather.  So if the vote turnout is low, it is likely that a greater percentage of the electorate was older, whiter, and more conservative. As voter turnout increases the vote tends to become more diverse, which in turn tends to favor liberals.  Less votes gets a conservative majority, which get you your 2/3s majority.

">When enemy soldiers are captured, they can be charged if they've also committed criminal offenses.  In order to *capture* someone you must bring them to area under your control, eg, *jurisdiction*.  So if for some reason you captured a pregnant soldier and they had a baby in detention then the 14th amendment provides citizenship.   If they have a baby outside of detention in an area where the US doesn't control, eg, not subject to us jurisdiction and us law, then the 14th doesn't.

"There's actually quite a bit of debate about it among legal scholars, so it's far from not ambiguous. Wong Kim Ark wasn't even a unanimous decision.  The authors of the citizenship clause even said that the phrase means ""not owing allegiance to anybody else,"" which is quite different from the standard you've offered. But perhaps you know better than the amendment's authors.  Or take the majority opinion in the Slaughterhouse Cases:  >The phrase, ""subject to its jurisdiction"" was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, **and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States**.  Richard Posner also disagrees, and has written that Congress could end birth tourism by denying citizenship.
