"With Trump, you have a guy who’s now purchased three different wives. I’m guessing that gives him the view that everything is for sale.",Naive_Inspection7723,2025-05-06T15:05:59,21
Actually Canada CAN say never.  And they are saying it. Trump is such a rapist.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-06T15:10:31,17
Trump would sell out the US in a heartbeat (and he has) so once again this is projection!,zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-05-06T15:03:22,17
Usa. You know how trump is trying to run your country as a business? What happens to businesses that have a ceo that tarnishes their brand to the point that no one wants to buy from that comoany? They go under.  Trump is doing that to the usa right now. No country is really interested in giving trump what he wants. Everyone is making trade deals with everyone else. Your country is going to suffer serious serious economic collapse soon. Canada has already started to send their beef to the UK. Experts to the UK up 250% percent since before trump. You guys are getting left out in the dust. Get rid of your Ceo just like how tesla is thinking of getting rid of elon musk.,Heliosvector,2025-05-06T15:27:48,8
Artificial lines !!! No borders!!! So then based on that jello brains thinking there are individual States??  What an idiot!! Do better America!,Okanaganwinefan,2025-05-06T15:10:53,6

"Trump just doesn't know when to quit. He almost single handedly torpedoed Poilievre's campaign and essentially campaigned for Carney (in an unintentional way) by continuing to bang on about Canada becoming the ""51st State"". It's a concept that is massively unpopular in both Canada as well as the United States of America, yet Trump just can't seem to let it go.",pragmatichokie,2025-05-06T15:23:43,2
What an embarrassment,theLordismysong,2025-05-06T15:33:42,3
"The only reason he said, ""Never say never"" is because his type of personality (disorder) always has to have the last word. Yap yap yap. Shut the fuck up you disgusting, embarrassing, useless excuse for a leader.   And guess what? You think Canadians would rather become Americans just so our taxes would go down? Think again - we love living amongst a healthy and educated population. We love nicely paved roads, environmental protections, etc, and even your big bad boogeyman - Diversity, Equality, Inclusion! Go fuck yourself, and stop dragging down my awesome American cousins. I'm even including the ones that voted for you, because they sure as shit didn't expect this.",solidartiteh,2025-05-06T18:51:36,3
Isn't Never say Never a Bieber song? Trump a Bieber fan boy? I mean he's a creepy old man..I can see it. ,arilupe,2025-05-06T15:07:14,2
"I’m convinced the Canada thing is coz Elon wants to be President.  Now I know what you thinking, he can’t run for president because he wasn’t born here.  Yes, but he has Canadian citizenship through his mother.  If Canada became a state they absolutely would have to allow all Canadians to be able to run for office.",TheorySudden5996,2025-05-06T21:27:13,1

Yeah I don't think Canada wants to be a mail order bride for citizenship though.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-06T15:36:48,8
"I'm sooooo thankful Canada elected Carney.  Carney is better educated compared to Trump, with a PHD in economics from Oxford. And Carney didn't get $millions from his daddy either. He grew up middle-class and made his own success. Carney knows he's Trump's intellectual superior and is not afraid to stand up against him.",reiddavies,2025-05-06T15:08:51,15

"Trump very well may order the military into Canada or Mexico under a number of lies.   The world must react as appropriate to any aggression on any nato member. I’m stuck in the US and absolutely don’t want a war.  I’d understand why one began though and unfortunately it’s not a tin foil hat theory to think Trump would instigate it.   Fuck Trump. Fuck republicans and anyone who voted that way in 2024. Also, fuck the 1/3 of my country that didn’t bother to vote. ",3MATX,2025-05-06T15:25:48,7
The real question is this: do US citizens want to fight an insurgency on their borders with a country full of people who are virtually indistinguishable from Americans?,CrankyVince2,2025-05-06T15:49:21,5
"Canada has England's, New Zealand's, and Australia's military you are forgetting to include.  The point of bullying Canada is to show we are unafraid of WWIII if we don't get our way.  The US is bluffing. They are terrified of WWIII.",Bob_Van_Goff,2025-05-06T16:54:43,1
