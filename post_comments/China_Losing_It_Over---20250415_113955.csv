China was once described by an expert as a nation of roughly the same population as the US with all the economic stratification we have... along with a BILLION people living at or below the starvation line. And they have the balls to call us peasants. It's hilarious how desperate they are.,ngoni,2025-04-15T19:38:23,1
"For a country so cock sure they’ll “win” a trade war, they’re sure not acting calm, cool, and collected.  Actually they appear to be rather frazzled and confused, which is telling.  The CCP is the ultimate liar and gaslighting power, but even they can’t hide their freak out with an effective poker face, they can’t muster one - because this will absolutely trash their economy and they know it, but they have this cultural “save face” mentality, where they **must** not look weak or such, they must “save face”.  So it’ll be a struggle to get to an off ramp that China can accept.  Not impossible!  But it’s going to take some pain on our side, compared with a whole heaping trillions of tons of pain China is gripping for.",cliffotn,2025-04-15T14:35:40,22
Agree 💯 % - they destroyed goose that laid golden eggs (American fair trade relationships) and are left with trading with the African and South American states.  That's what they get for their parasitic trade practices.,GiediOne,2025-04-15T16:18:12,2
They will roll tanks over protesting students. They’ll do the same to any dissidents that complain they are starving and jobless.,BH11B,2025-04-15T18:15:35,9
