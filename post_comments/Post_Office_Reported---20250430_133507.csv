"This explains the story out of Oklahoma, where they barged into a home looking for someone who used to live there. They were lazy in their investigation and used the fact that mail used to go to that address with the suspects name.",leroynicks,2025-04-30T13:46:18,21

"***From Rolling Stoneâ€™s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  The U.S. Postal Service has reportedly begun cooperating with the Trump administration's efforts to track down undocumented immigrants for deportation.  According to a Wednesday report from The Washington Post, U.S. Postal Inspection Service â€” the law enforcement arm of USPS â€” is cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security, which is using the mail carrierâ€™s vast access to address, I.P., shipping, and other data to help track down undocumented migrants. Sources who spoke to the Post say the service agreed to cooperate amid public rhetoric from the president and his administration indicating they are considering privatizing the USPS.

Would have thought it would be a hunt for drugs.... It's scary they are probably feeding this information into a Palantir type situation that they can use to guess human networks and if they meet parameters they think indicate non citizens activity.  Kind of like the Lavender Ai they used to exterminate civilians that had phone numbers previously used for 'terrorist activities'.  I suspect this will get things wrong and get civilian and law enforcement hurt with little ROI other than progressing fascism,KingThar,2025-04-30T13:42:11,1
