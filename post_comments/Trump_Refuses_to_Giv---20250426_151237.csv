We are proud to care for other canadian. We chose and like our system of education, with its diversity , our healt system is in the medle of our contry. Not perfect but nobody will bankrup because of a stay in hospital for a long run, and no more expensive than your one.  You chose your way, we choose ours.  I could talk and talk about it a long time but I have chores to do has you probably have to. So lets agree to desagree, WE WILL Never BE THE 51st STATE of America.  But we can be freindy nation working together for the best of our own country.",Proud_End3085,2025-04-28T10:09:09,1
"Then call it what it is. Trumps narcissism. Not any actual wrong doing on bidens part, which is what you originally tried to say.",CougdIt,2025-04-27T17:44:08,1
"You clearly don't. The US has not been taken over by a dictator. Your statements lack any nuance and are simply cathartic vents. They're not logical, true, or practical. You're just venting.",mcbaginns,2025-04-26T21:29:57,0
"I can agree with you, I don't want Canada to be part of the Union. I also don't recommend even joining since many states are failing, why would we would want to add more people and taxes ridiculous high everywhere, regardless of which party is in power they won't remove/lower it. We need a stable healthy economy lol but I don't think Canada will be 51state nor should ever. It will be hassle legally wise(has to go through a lengthy process which takes years, and not done in within a month or 4 years,¬† and the other option most likely potential military conflict could arise which is not worth it. I wish Trump would drop that obsession.",Admiraltiger7,2025-04-28T11:36:01,1
"Half this country including him believe Biden did do wrong.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you believe it or not.  It is narcissism, but it‚Äôs also possibly true.  But I know you don‚Äôt want to consider that possibility.",1nt2know,2025-04-27T19:45:03,1
What nuance is missing? If you want to prove me wrong then show me how the Republicans stopped their leader's years-long crime spree. I must have missed that!,mike0sd,2025-04-26T21:41:57,1
"Beside, Trump would have no possibility to have a republican party in power because we would not vote for it. We would be like California except for two small province population wise. So why cut the branches you are sitting on  ü§£",Proud_End3085,2025-04-28T14:57:20,1
It‚Äôs possibly true?  What evidence is there that the legal proceedings were anything other than laws being enforced? And what has Biden ever done to personally involve himself beyond what is required of his role?,CougdIt,2025-04-27T19:47:56,1
"What nuance?   Trump isn't a dictator. There is 0 nuance to this. There is 0 truth to this.  Now, you're responding with sarcasm. Was it cathartic? Cause it wasn't practical or logical or nuanced, that's for sure. Just emotional and reactionary and hyperbolic venting",mcbaginns,2025-04-26T21:43:26,-1
"You're not being serious, Trump has completely neutered the Republican party, all they know is fealty to him, and they follow his commands no matter how illegal or immoral they may be, even outright atrocities like sending people to concentration camps.",mike0sd,2025-04-26T21:46:14,2

You quite literally do not understand the point. I'm not sure how else to explain it.  I am 100% serious that Trump is not a dictator. Do you know what that word means? Were you absent for the election? All they know is fealty? No matter how immoral or illegal? How do you not see how these hyperbolic statements lack any nuance and are also blatantly false?,mcbaginns,2025-04-26T21:50:00,0
"You really want to get into the ""election"" of proven election criminal Trump?",mike0sd,2025-04-26T21:51:22,0
Yes. It was an election. There are no quotes. It was an election. You seem to not be living in reality. We both hate Trump but only one of us seems reasonable about it. The 2020 election was legit and so was 2024. Don't stoop to republicans level and cry election fraud like how they did,mcbaginns,2025-04-27T08:58:17,1
Give a legitimate reason why you think Trump and the Republicans stopped their election cheating streak,mike0sd,2025-04-27T10:37:18,1
You're incapable of a nuanced discussion and will never understand the point.  Good luck being stagnant your whole life. Goodbye,mcbaginns,2025-04-27T11:01:48,1
So what you're saying is that you don't have a single reason to believe that the Republicans followed the law. Makes sense,mike0sd,2025-04-27T11:02:26,1
