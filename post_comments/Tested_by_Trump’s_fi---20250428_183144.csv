Time for blue states to start firing off anti-fascist legislation.  The DOJ is not staffed to take on a laws from dozen states at a time.,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-28T18:47:48,10
"Hopefully, the Dems have figured out that focusing on Trump's incompetence and chaos is far more useful in driving up his disapproval than are the Dems' go-to messages about his meanness and illegal conduct.  A lot of Americans are willing to give a pass to a president who they believe is capable and achieving results.  It's failings in areas that matter to them such as the economy that will turn them off.    If the public sees Trump as being inept, then they will start piling on with the rest of it.  But it really needs to start with the job failures, not the ethical ones.",I405CA,2025-04-28T18:40:34,8
Our reputation as a place of sanctuary for people seeking asylum and rest from persecution and oppression has been permanently damaged.  Our reputation as a stopgap for countries needing assistance in times of war and poverty has been shattered. We the People are slowly becoming We the facilitators of pain and suffering.  Fuck the Trump administration. Everyone who voted for him should be ashamed. Those who still support him have no understanding of history and no pride in the legacy of generational change that occurred over the last 249 years.  Our continual evolution as a country has been stunted by these fuckwit criminals.,industrial-complex,2025-04-28T18:59:40,4
"Although there are some intelligent and courageous Democrats, the majority of them and the party itself are useless corporate teat-suckers.   They are bland and unimaginative and have offered no useful strategies to effectively stand up to Trump.   I fully expect that before 2026 Trump will have destroyed enough of the political infrastructure in the United States and his goons, including the police and DOJ will stand ready to intimidate anyone who speaks out against Trump that nothing resembling a free and fair election will be possible at the midterm. Therefore the Democratic Party is no longer relevant.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T19:09:36,7
They really are the do-nothing-democrats. I’m not expecting anything.,Dannomyte79,2025-04-28T19:09:52,4

"The good news, say Democratic leaders and top party strategists wrapping their heads around what Donald Trump’s next 45 months will mean, is that there is no shortage of actual impacts to talk about – and that’s before the market turmoil has had the effect on prices or jobs that they expect.  The bad news, they say: the speed and thoroughness out of the White House keeps scrambling their already frantic efforts to fight back.  Every bad Trump poll number has top Democratic operatives and officials wondering if they’re actually seeing the country start to move their way again or if they’re just talking themselves into seeing that.  It’s what Illinois Rep. Sean Casten, first elected in the anti-Trump wave of 2018, [calls a progression from apathy to fear to anger to action](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/politics/democratic-resistance-learning-curve/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit).  Now: “I think we’re moving from incoherent to directed anger,” Casten said, then added his own stage direction: “He says, optimistically.”",cnn,2025-04-28T18:33:02,3

For as much hare as they received in passing the CR last month they dodged a missile.  Had the government been shutdown throughout all this the Dems would have bought  a tanking economy.,5minArgument,2025-04-28T19:04:52,1
Fights? You think the current Dem leadership is up for a fight? They brought sign paddles to a nuclear meltdown.,Significant-Self5907,2025-04-28T20:33:20,1
So can you imagine that the Democrats get back into power and evoke the Orange Umpa Lumpa law of deporting Trump himself to an international prison like Mexico or Venezuela as he is a criminal and then don’t allow him back into the US….,mavric101,2025-04-29T00:39:56,1

"The problem is because of Citizens United it’s very difficult to get elected without corporate donations. Money talks, and donors expect results from their donations. ",quest814,2025-04-28T19:15:33,3
"Yea, the party definitely feels like little more than controlled opposition at this point.  They give MAGA something else to forth over, and they rattle their sabers to distract the voters on the left and keep them from organizing on their own.",lordagr,2025-04-29T02:12:15,1
"Honestly the first step needs to be we just have some unity at very minimum. Dems voting yes on their bills when they don’t have to, censuring their own, infighting. Republicans have a lot wrong with them but at least they seem to *usually* be in lock step with each other (which isn’t necessarily a good thing when considering what makes for good policy, but to make a good opposition it would be necessary). We’re always in disarray with each other and can’t ever do anything together.   Can’t even agree on messaging",Lostsock1995,2025-04-29T01:09:15,2

How does AOC do it? How does Bernie do it?  They both managed to get elected and reelected while still being free to speak their minds.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T19:40:46,3
That’s two of 535.  And they got elected in very blue areas.  Yes it can be done but it’s extremely difficult.  ,quest814,2025-04-28T20:09:09,3
