Beware folks. This is but a District Court. Back in the day... That meant something. Not anymore. So it now goes to Appellate then ultimately SCOTUS. Until they hear this... Assume his plans to limit voting rights are going as planned. This was all defined in Project 2025.,williamgman,2025-04-24T17:08:45,26

"Pretty much everyone saw this coming.   One of the things that might, is, going to save us, is that elections are run entirely at the state level.  Trump and the GOP will continue to obstruct those elections like they've been doing since the 80s (at least), but they can't only go so far as the elected officials and individuals in each state allow them.",atreeismissing,2025-04-24T23:27:02,2

"Why is proving you are a US citizen before you can vote such a big deal? Only a US citizen has the right to vote. So it stands to reason that those who are against this can only be non-citizens, or some political party that benefits from illegal votes. When did common sense and reason go out the fucking window? If you went to Germany, or Canada, or Italy do you think they wouldn’t check your citizenship before allowing you to vote?!? WTF is wrong with this country?",DaboJunkie,2025-04-24T21:41:57,-4
The conservatives on the Supreme Court should uphold this ruling.  The ruling is based upon the fact that elections are largely a state matter.  The feds don't play much role in how elections are conducted and have no good argument for turning this aspect of elections into an exception.,I405CA,2025-04-24T17:24:41,9
"They're also likely to use this as another excuse for when they try to do their own version of the Enabling Act.

Ultimately it’s because it can very easily disenfranchise voters in poverty. If identification was freely available and subsidized by the government I imagine you’d see at least 80% approval for it.,BeastieGirl907,2025-04-24T23:55:58,4
"It's adding extra layers to voting, layers which cost money and complicate the process through requiring ever-increasing amounts of documentation.  When I started voting, I presented my driver's license to get my voter registration card, and presented my voter registration card when I voted.  That was it.  With this legislation, I have to have a driver's license, a copy of my birth certificate (which i already had to present in order to get my driver's license) **and** my passport (which i already had to present the previous two identifying documents to acquire), and they all have to match.  If I married and changed my surname to that of my spouse, I have to get a copy of my marriage license in addition to everything else and go through a lengthy process of updating *all of my documentation* before I can vote.  If I've been adopted by a step-parent and taken that person's surname, same thing applies.  It's a big deal because a hundred million people could be disallowed the right to vote, based purely on *manufactured technicalities specifically designed to prevent voters from voting*.  It's called voter suppression.  And it *sucks*.  It's wrong in every way and on every level, an underhanded way for corrupt politicians to secure their offices by pretending that people simply don't exist.  It violates both the spirit of the Constitution and the letter of the law, but, like gerrymandering, it's a tactic that hasn't been ruled illegal (yet).",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-24T22:05:15,6

"No, it’s not a big deal. You do realize many states issue drivers licenses to undocumented migrants? So by your own account they can vote. This is the same old clap trap bullshit everyone spews that blocks citizenship verification. Act like 100 million people are too stupid, or inept, or lacking resources to prove their citizenship. Yet, i bet if i had a million dollar raffle, and you needed to prove citizenship to receive the prize, not a single fucking one would have a problem providing the documentation. In fact it takes more proof to get Comcast cable than it does to vote. Total fucking bullshit. Not to mention it’s a one time deal.",DaboJunkie,2025-04-24T22:14:34,-7
"I think that they'll actually go with it.  It doesn't prohibit states from demanding proof of citizenship.  But the states have the latitude to make that decision.

"Except the rates of actual voted fraud are exceedingly low. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-widespread-is-election-fraud-in-the-united-states-not-very/  Non-citizens are not registering to vote beyond a couple of idiots who didn’t realize they were not supposed to.  Forcing proof of citizenship in the way they propose will actively disenfranchise any married woman who changed her name because she’ll need an ID, birth certificate, and marriage license. Think about all of the people in the LA area who lost their homes, I’ll bet a lot of them lost important documents like marriage licenses and birth certificates. Or how about hurricane prone areas?  And it’s for literally no good reason. There is no evidence of the kind of fraud that this aims to prevent.",writebadcode,2025-04-24T22:34:11,5
"Non-citizen driver licenses are marked as non-citizen and if one of those non-citizens tries to register to vote, it will be denied based on the fact they are not a citizen.  If they nonetheless still try to vote and succeed, the government will easily be able to check, prosecute and invalidate their votes for the same reason.  Fraud just doesn't happen in any relevant proportion and all your measures are doing is making it harder for people to vote and disenfranchising actual eligible voters who will have to go through insane hoops to exercise their right as citizens.  All of the countries you mentioned on your original comment have much easier processes to vote, in part because unlike the US, they have a national ID that is easily obtainable and already serves as definitive proof of citizenship and it's easy to register to vote as a citizen.",Prestigious-Place941,2025-04-24T23:12:21,3

"It's not about the right to *use* a name, it's about the right to vote after changing a name.  Under this legislation, a person who's name differs from the name on the birth certificate, for any reason, is ineligible to register for voting until or unless the name change is demonstrated to be valid and certified.  The legislation requires the voter to go through multiple extra steps prove that the person who was born with one name is still the same person after changing that name, if the person wishes to register to vote.  Per this legislation, after changing a name, the person is no longer a legally existing entity until additional documentation re-establishes that person's identity to prove that the person who was born is the same as the person who stands in front of the registrar.  84% of all married women would be ineligible to vote under this legislation (79% change their surname to that of their spouse, 5% append their spouse's surname to theirs with a hyphen) unless they obtain copies of their birth certificates and marriage licenses, go to courthouses, fill out paperwork, pay fees, and replace ***all of their existing identification with new identification***.  *And* acquire a passport, if they didn't already have one, or perform the same process to update the passport.  Almost 60,000,000 women forced to jump through hoops to vote.  And that's just married women.  There are roughly 5,000,000 adopted U.S.-born children in the U.S., and \~4 million step-children.  A good portion of those use the surnames of their legal guardians and would be disenfranchised by this legislation in the same way married women would.  The passport requirement is even less sensible, not only because many people in the U.S. don't have passports, but also because an immigrant is *more* likely to have a passport than American citizens in certain demographics.  Approximately 80% of African-Americans don't have passports, versus nearly 50% of the immigrants, foreign visitors and students, and migrant workers who have passports.  Furthermore, all of the documentation shown to obtain a passport is already required in order to obtain a valid state ID or driver's license (which, as i corrected you in a previous response, is not the same as the identification issued to immigrants), so requiring a passport is equivalent to saying, ""Prove you are who you say you are *again*, because the previous proofs which are still valid and legally acceptable are being questioned"".  And all of this is unnecessary because **our court system already keeps records of these things**.  There's no justification for requiring a person who's changed his/her name to present five forms of documentation in order to vote when **all of that documentation is already on file and verifiable**.  The one thing you've said that I agree with is that it's nonsense, because it *is* nonsense, but it's nonsense imposed on voters by a group of people **intentionally trying to prevent certain demographics from voting**.  It's legislative gerrymandering.  It's not to verify citizenship, because citizenship is already verifiable and 100% verified at several steps along the way, it's a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise people who will not vote according to a preferred outcome.  To *restrict voting amongst the eligible population* so the results of voting can be controlled.  To use your own example, people who live in gerrymandered districts don't ""lose their right"" to use their address, but they do lose the right to *vote in the district that existed before it was gerrymandered*, and they also have to re-register to vote because their districts were changed.  Same bullshit, different way to impose it on voters.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-25T06:26:02,3
