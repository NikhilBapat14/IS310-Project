"On the plus side, this Alito guy will forever be remembered as a corrupt toxic pile of human garbage and once he’s gone he will leave a grave very worthy of pissing on and vandalizing.",smp7401,2025-04-22T12:42:05,3590
"By Gabe Whisnant — Breaking News Editor |  In a narrow 5-4 decision on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants who agree to leave the U.S. voluntarily are entitled to deadline flexibility when the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday.  The ruling came in the case of Hugo Abisai Monsalvo Velázquez, a Mexican national who entered the country illegally as a teenager and lived in Colorado for nearly 20 years before receiving a removal order in 2021. The case was argued in November 2024, shortly after President Donald Trump's re-election and amid a renewed focus on immigration enforcement.

That this case made it all the way to the Supreme Court says a lot about the level of pettiness Republicans want displayed toward people who are already leaving the country.,AdHopeful3801,2025-04-22T13:31:53,1013
Who puts deadlines on weekends?  There are a plethora of formulae and algorithm that skips weekends and holidays for you.  Or maybe just rule them all as number of business days to make things simpler for everyone?,thieh,2025-04-22T12:23:09,1102
"It's deeply concerning to see even something as minor as extending deadlines for deportation proceedings met with this level of legal maneuvering, because Justice Gorsuch, alongside Roberts and the liberal justices, actually wrote the majority opinion stating that standard legal principles apply to extend the deadline, which, honestly, makes you wonder whether this ruling is truly representative of progress, or just another calculated move in a much larger, more complicated game, especially given the larger context of renewed immigration enforcement under the current administration, and, you know, I guess it's just another reminder of how even the smallest details can have huge consequences.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-22T12:31:29,185

"If the Chief Justice is on the majority, then it defaults to them, otherwise it will go to whoever has the most compelling arguments, i.e. the arguments that the majority sign-off on.  If Thomas or Alito are on the Majority, but not chosen to write the majority opinion, then they will usually write what's called a concurrence, This is where they state that they agree with the majority, but want the opinion to go further, usually in some batshit insane way.   This is where you find phrases like ""joined in part"". Because the justice joined the majority in part, and had notes on the technicalities or such.  If the two assholes are in the minority, they'll definitely write a dissent, and it will be batshit crazy.  Concurrences and dissents have zero force of law, except that Thomas likes to cite his own concurrences and dissents as if they were valid case law and binding precedent.

"Yes.  You can read more about the underlying case in pages 1-3.   In short, the immigration judge ruled that his claim that he would be persecuted if deported was not valid, but that he would be allowed 60 days to leave on his own rather than being forcibly removed (and punished, with things like being blacklisted for X years from any otherwise legal methods of reentry)  He's allowed to file a motion to reconsider within that timeframe if there is new evidence that could help his claim; that would also stop the clock and not make him be forcibly removed.  His attorney served the paperwork to the court on that Friday (calendar day 59). The court formally accepted it on that Monday morning (calendar day 62). The official filing date is when the court accepts the filing.  So the question here is: even if Monday is the official filing date, was that too late for the ""60 days"" rule. The Supreme court said no, it should count as on time, because the 60 days rule should be interpreted consistently with other similar rules that have always been interpreted that way, and therefore the court *does* have to consider his filing as on-time, and the penalties for not voluntarily leaving the country should be undone.  It does not mean that his filing will lead to his case being reversed, only that he will have his hearing and he will not  be penalized for failing to leave in the agreed upon window.",GradientCement,2025-04-22T19:24:06,28
