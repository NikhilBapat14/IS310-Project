His eventual fall is going to be incredible to watch.,Taint_Liquor,2025-05-03T11:11:53,20
"*From Bloomberg News reporters Nick Wadhams, Natalia Drozdiak, and Eric Martin*  A jolt of staff upheaval this week made Marco Rubio the first person in 50 years to hold the top two national security jobs in the US government, the culmination of a journey from his role as Donald Trump’s rival for the presidency to one of his most prominent aides.  Rubio’s ascent to both secretary of state and interim national security adviser coincided with the fall of Mike Waltz, whose hawkish foreign policy stances made Trump’s MAGA base wary. On the surface, the upheaval highlights the former Florida senator’s deft navigation around concerns about his late-to-hatch Trump-world bona fides and his emergence as an impassioned messenger for the president.  Yet the question of who won or lost Trump’s favor masks a reality for both men: neither Rubio nor Waltz has taken the lead on some of the foreign policy issues most important to the president, and their influence has never been truly tested.

"trump claimed he never signed the alien enemy act eo and that ‘marco rubio handled it, he wanted them out and we go along with that.’   previously hegseth and noem did not recommend invoking the insurrection act. but a more recent eo asks the sec of defense (hegseth) and ag bondi to essentially determine the rules of engagement when using military ‘to prevent crime.” it sounds like the insurrection act with extra steps.   hegseth’s group chat buddy just got relieved for checking the chats during a cabinet meeting (lol). that puts heat on hegseth to protect his job and rubberstamp trump’s military agenda or essentially say no a second time. if he says no and gets relieved you can bet your house that marco rubio will become sec of defense as well and absolutely put trump’s or more likely his own plan into motion",wordfiend99,2025-05-03T22:05:17,1

"I'm the polar opposite of Rubio politically, but years ago he did seem to have some integrity. I guess nobody should be surprised about his shifting allegiance, given his ambition. At some point he will be one of those people claiming he did what he did because he hoped to exert some control and stop things from being even worse. I don't think it'll serve him well in the long run.",Moonspindrift,2025-05-03T12:38:22,3
Let’s dispel the notion that Marco Rubio doesn’t know what he’s doing. Marco Rubio knows exactly what he’s doing.,metalshoes,2025-05-03T12:42:53,6
I don't know where this narrative that Rubio had any integrity comes from. He has always been awful.,MarkZuckerbergsPerm,2025-05-03T15:45:22,4
