I hate to say it but we almost have to let this insanity continue so that it's experienced by more and more people and it's no longer just an abstract concept.   And those people are the ones protesting and voting D to prove how compassionate they are.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-03T10:01:37,22
Is this another one of those things that the left says literally never happensÂ ,Sheriff_Hopper,2025-05-03T11:00:28,14

"I understand but it's already here and the most effective way to stomp it out is from the people rejecting it in large numbers. Hearts and minds.   Anyways, my comment was more a thought exercise which has been proven to be wrong before.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-03T13:28:58,3
"You may be right but I don't think so. It's all well and good to claim to be open minded and compassionate but reality tends to sharpen the mind, especially when little Suzy has years of training and ambition destroyed by some guy.   The crossover from the last election was no accident.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-03T11:23:24,5
