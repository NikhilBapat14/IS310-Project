Imagine being too corrupt for *Miriam Adelson*.,Euphoric-Bed7379,2025-04-26T15:35:41,153
"I’m tired of articles where terrible rich people who used their ill gotten money to get this ass elected and have benefited financially from his demolition of the working class suddenly get upset when one of their personal concerns doesn’t go exactly the way they want.   You were ok with benefiting from stock market manipulation, you were ok with “deporting” American toddlers, ok with arresting judges, being in contempt of the Supreme Court, him openly discussing a third term, his long history of sexual assault. But a former politician stealing money for their own benefit is crossing the line?   This entire presidency has been rich and powerful people ripping away things that were publicly owned and putting them in control of a few people.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-26T16:10:42,43
"In pretty sure this lady just ""gets mad"" at Trump when she needs a favor. She's done this before. He gave her a medal last time. ",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-26T16:39:35,11
"In Trump's, MAGA's, and conservative America, those who work very hard for their rackets should be able to spend their hard-swindled money like any other money and shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of working with this very dirty money due to the taught woke ESG values like lawfulness and honesty being taught in these liberal Obama DEI schools.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-26T15:43:48,21
"Sad as it is, I think this is the only way Trump is going to get pushed out of power. When the big money gets so upset that they turn to the Republicans whose campaigns they fund, and tell them to do something about Trump.",NoPomegranate4794,2025-04-26T15:55:36,15

"It cracks me up when MAGA people think they can critisize Trump.  Lady, you better shut up. You’re maga. You don’t get to critisize Trump.  What, you think you’re safe because you have money? He’s shaking down the nation’s top law firms and universities. He’s going to get revenge on you.",Y0___0Y,2025-04-26T17:25:36,3
What’s disturbing about all of this is that people are surprised the billionaire didn’t use her influence and money to stop supposed free press from not criticizing Trump.,idkbruh653,2025-04-26T18:38:47,3

Fucking bitch. You should see the documentary “the Bibi files” about Netanyahu. She and a few other Jewish billionaires are called at the Israeli Police station to testify about all the gifts they send to the genocidal maniac in exchange of favours. This bitch feeds on the American people and sends money to fund a genocide with the blessings of at least half the US population.,CryptoNoob-BRLN,2025-04-27T05:24:47,1
Miriam Adelson has done way too much to empower Trump to give a crap what she is annoyed about now.,Unfair_Elderberry118,2025-04-27T07:37:28,1

Corruption only works when Adelson spends it properly on her candidates.  She spawned Trump 2.0 and she can now see what she hath wrought.,racingwthemoon,2025-04-27T09:29:05,1
