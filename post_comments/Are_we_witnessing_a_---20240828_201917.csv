"In foreign policy and trade, it does feel like we're reverting back to the pre World War II ideological positions on America's place in the world.  From WWII until the current era there was more or less a bipartisan consensus, especially after Ike defeated Robert Taft for the Republican nomination in 1952 on a unified western front held together through alliances and trade.  Prior to that the Republicans had been more pro tariffs and and more isolationist while Democrats were more free trade and more internationalist.  Given the two global wars it does does kind of make sense that you'd have folks pushing for a more unified front to avoid anything like that from happening again...and we haven't.  There have been conflicts, to be sure, but we haven't tipped over into World War III.  There's an argument to be made that retreating to the pre ""liberal international order"" corners increases those risks of giant global conflicts.",federalist66,2024-08-29T08:49:49,9
"I think it's pretty unreasonable to characterize the Dems as hawkish and the GOP as non-interventionalist. It was the Dems who got the Iran deal figured out. It was the GOP who blew that up because they wanted to take an aggressive hardline approach to Iran. Trump has repeatedly threatened war against the enemies he wants to see as bad guys.  But there has been a shift. A more erudite way of looking at it is that until recently, both parties were pretty consistently in agreement on basic concepts of post-WW2 foreign policy. Both parties agreed on who our allies were and who our enemies were, and both sides were committed broadly to a ""security through large alliances"" kind of approach. The different parties often had different approaches towards how to achieve these particular goals, but the goals themselves weren't divergent. But that is different now.  The Dems have largely continued in this same approach to foreign policy. They want to strengthen our existing alliances, particularly with NATO, and our geo-political enemies would include various dictators and stated enemies of America (Russia, China, N Korea, etc). Middle eastern countries can go either way, which is consistent with a Cold War kind of approach to that region. Israel is our friend, even if right now they're kind putting as much strain on that relationship as possible, and some folks in the party want to weaken that. We will back Ukraine because they are our ally and Russia is our enemy and while we do want peace in Palestine...we also want to support our alliance with Israel.   The GOP has changed a number of these basic ideas. The GOP is openly questioning the value of NATO. The GOP is also doesn't agree who our enemies are--they seem to think Russia is not an enemy (even though Russia has literally said themselves that they are opposed to us). But the GOP is definitely a stronger and more hawkish supporter of Israel, and in general is much  more likely to view any Middle Eastern state that's not Israel as an enemy. They oppose the war in Ukraine because they (want to) support Russia.  Just calling these differences a matter of hawkishness vs. dovishness is too low effort for me.",mormagils,2024-08-29T12:24:12,18
"The GOP is only ""non-interventionist"" in situations where it benefits Russia, and then only because their cult leader supports Putin.

"There's an old trope that Democrats want a small army and want to send it everywhere and Republicans want a large army and don't want to send it anywhere.

Just my opinion.",Outrageous-Intern278,2024-08-29T23:11:59,4
I think it's just each party likes to complain about what the other party does when they're not in power. Case in point the Republicans complain about deficits when the Democrats are in charge. When the Republicans are in charge they disregard frugality and spend on their projects. Republicans are complaining about Democrats starting wars until they get in power then they will go ahead and create their own wars.,JohnBosler,2024-08-30T17:37:17,2
Yeah the long standing “death to America” crew - Iran - certainly hasn’t said or acted (Hamas terror and other terror groups they fund and support not to mention the complete difference the way woman are treated in the two countries) but it’s the way Russia has acted towards us especially with our expansion of NATO boundaries right up to their door step when saying years ago we would never do that that makes Russia the complete enemy of America in comparison to Iran who is so grateful for our existence.   Yeah Iran is hands down definitely more of our friend then Russia is and deserves billions more of American citizen’s hard earned dollars given to them to enable them to continue to spread their humanitarian generosity through out the world.,Psychological-Ball77,2024-08-31T09:40:48,0
America is bankrupt.  The question is how long do Americans want to pay to protect Europe and other countries with our military?  The Democrat hawkish position is difficult to explain as the military budget could be used for social programs.

"That’s a ridiculous and false take on the GOP foreign policies.   The Iran deal was a farse. Iran was not living up to there requirements. The refused to let inspectors in to their nuclear facilities and continued to work towards a nuclear weapon. That’s why Trump “blew it up.” It wasn’t working. Trump applied strict restrictions on Iran causing them to go broke. This kept them from supplying their proxies. Biden-Harris get in office, remove sanctions, beg to renter the deal, give them 6 billion for 5 hostages, tell them “Don’t “ get involved in the Israel/ Hamas war…then does absolutely nothing to them when they attach Israel. Who doesn’t recognize or enemies?  GOP is not questioning the strength and necessity of NATO. Trump forced the other countries in the alliance to pay their fair share. We were footing the majority of the bill.   They know who are enemies are and Trump did not allow for them to create an evil alliance (as Biden/Harris have). Biden/Harris are weak on the world stage. They appease our enemies. Won’t let Ukraine use our weapons to take out Russian military assets inside Russia. And they’ve slow walked all financial and military aid.

"> hat’s why Trump “blew it up.” It wasn’t working. Trump applied strict restrictions on Iran causing them to go broke. This kept them from supplying their proxies.  This is so regrettably, tragically false…it shows willful refusal to acknowledge reality. Iran is closer than its ever been to a nuclear weapon AFTER we pulled out of the JCPOA. Trump made the situation so much worse by removing any safeguards or incentives for Iran to comply with inspections. It was an abject failure of a decision, leading to Iran’s weapons program spinning back up again.  Iran never stopped arming proxies during the Trump administration. It is bewildering to even think so: how could Hezbollah have maintained its presence in Syria? Lebanon? Thru the Trump years? Did we forget all the militia attacks in Iraq, from Iran-backed groups? The rocket attacks on American soldiers there? All of that equipment flowed thru during the Trump years. He never stopped it; because it just doesn’t work like that. There’s no spigot of money he could just turn off - Iran has learned how to equip its proxies under sanctions for YEARS now. They never mattered. All maximum pressure did was bring Iran closer to a bomb.  Partisan narratives like this are comforting. They make things nice and black and white. But they just aren’t true. The reality is really quite harsh - actions have consequences and incompetence does too. Please understand that - lives are at stake. The world is cruel and does not care what political party the President happens to belong to…",[deleted],2024-08-30T21:40:06,6
"Lol, you're the one who's ridiculous and false.   Even if Iran was cheating a bit on their deal--of which by the way there is absolutely ZERO evidence--we still unilaterally pulled out of the deal. We literally stopped abiding by our side of the deal and then punished Iran. That's what we did. Iran absolutely was letting inspectors in according to the timeline afforded by the deal. Did they maybe be less than completely transparent with those inspectors? It's possible, but really all we ever confirmed was that Iran WAS enriching uranium, which they still could have used for energy purposes not for atomic bomb purposes. Your timeline here is inaccurate.  Regarding the rest of your point on Iran...I'm sorry, but I'm not going to engage partisan characterizations. I'm just not. Please, if you want to have this discussion, you're going to need to provide evidence and facts to back up your assertions, not the most recent rant on Jesse Waters.  Trump ABSOLUTELY did question the value of NATO. He actually didn't ""force them to pay their fair share"" but did talk about doing that a lot. Under Trump, our NATO relationships actively got more strained and he very much did float the concept of pulling out of NATO entirely if they didn't pay more in his second term. Fortunately he was voted out of office before then.   ""They know who our enemies are"" and ""evil alliance"" are exactly the kind of nonsense I'm criticizing. The GOP has decided Iran will be our enemies despite major strides between our countries in the Obama years potentially moving them out of enemy status, the sort of thing which happened several times with Middle Eastern countries during the Cold War. And the GOP absolutely DOES NOT believe Russia are definitionally our enemies despite Russia saying they are just that in their own words.  The only reason our enemies were more combative in the Biden years was because we weren't giving them everything they wanted. Sure, there might not have been a war in Ukraine if Trump won. That's because Trump was allowing Putin to annex everything he wanted without having to fight a war, which is way worse. Ukraine has literally recently invaded Russia after we renewed our aid to them, aid which has consistently been ""slow walked"" because the GOP is slowing it down.   You're drinking the partisan cool aid. It's one thing to support the changes to the GOP foreign policy agenda. That's an opinion people can authentically have. But this is not a reasonable take on anything.",mormagils,2024-08-30T10:26:07,4

"Lol, did you actually read the article you linked? From the article:  "" The Vienna-based IAEA [reported earlier this month](https://apnews.com/article/iran-uranium-enrichment-iaea-us-tensions-af4a183a2e97375708a494d5324c2836) that Iran had slowed the pace at which it is enriching uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels. That was seen as a sign that Tehran was trying to ease tensions after years of strain between it and the U.S.""  ""Then-President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the accord in 2018, restoring crippling sanctions. Iran began breaking the terms a year later. Formal talks in Vienna to try to restart the deal [collapsed in August 2022](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-iran-dubai-nuclear-middle-east-45ce172ef6fbcf367c77b11ea8c045f5).""  As I said, your timeline is off. This article was written in 2023, 5 years after Trump pulled out of the deal. All credible information suggests Iran WAS complying with the deal when Trump pulled out of it, and then continued to do so out of good faith for a year. It was only after Trump called off the deal and then continued to antagonize Iran that it started breaking the terms of the deal it was no longer held to.  > Trump threatened to pull out of NATO as a negotiation tactic. And it worked. Many allies raised the percentage of GDP they allocated to defense.  Ok, so Trump DID suggest pulling out of NATO, look at that. And it worked to get them to pay more, but it also undermined our NATO alliances and that is arguably a very, very, very poor outcome that far outweighs what Trump think he accomplished.  > If you think Iran is our friend you do not know anything about it.  Lol, I *promise* you I know more about the history of our foreign policy in the Middle East than you do. The point is the Iran deal was part of the process of moving them out of enemy status. They weren't exactly allies at that point, but the needle was shifting, until Trump did everything he could to push it back and get it stuck in that position. And for the record, ""sending someone billions of dollars overnight"" is called foreign aid and that's how it works. You can literally say that's exactly the same relationship we have with Israel, and quite frankly even with us sending them absurd amounts of money they still find a way to challenge us quite a bit.  > Irans proxies have attacked our troops in the Middle East over 280xs. We’ve responded (weakly) 10xs. Weakness  Ok, so are you saying that war with Iran is a desirable foreign policy? What a moron.  > The only way to deal with Iran is through strength. Appeasement only encourages the terror they sponsor.  Actually, because relations with Iran have been warming, they've way cut down on their terror attacks. That's the point: our relations are warming, and war or terror strikes with Iran less like than they've been since the fall of the Shah. That's great! That's exactly how we know the Obama-style approach works.  And sure, Trump did have sanctions on Russia. But he also undermined those sanctions. Look at the one that sanctioned groups for the 2018 election interference. Well he also straight up asked Russia to interfere in our elections, so that's at BEST a mixed message. That sort of stuff was what we saw with Trump all the time.  > Biden/Harris removed many of them. Russia invaded Ukraine during Obama and during Biden administrations. Funny how they didn’t invade anyone when Trump was in office.  Yeah, because Trump was helping Putin take Ukrainian territory without the need for an invasion.

Like it or not, we are committed to the defense and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Trump openly challenged that. These are facts.
