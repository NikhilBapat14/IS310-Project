"As someone who works in finance and has been in the field for decades, I can tell you that the risks are high for a  very bad outcome.  In 2008, during the great recession, conditions were much worse than they are today (so far), but we had lots of smart people in government helping to restore the system.  Today, this safety net does not exist, as the people in charge are clueless and are contributing to market chaos.",metskyfan,2025-04-06T08:28:34,8

Everytime this happens we get more billionaires and life gets harder for everyone else and all these people have to do to get votes is be racist bigots.  Their voters believe that black people are getting benefits and jobs they don't deserve and they can't accept the existence of trans people.,5050Clown,2025-04-06T01:21:25,6

What else happened in March of 2020? ü§î     Again because I know I'm gonna get downvoted to hell, fuck Trump, his economic policy is bad, he's putting us towards a recession, he's a fascist dictator, etc etc. This post is still dishonest and you don't need this post to explain how horrible Trump is.",Gullible-Ideal8731,2025-04-05T23:52:26,-5

Let them buy the dip.   Rich short sellers will borrow their stock. Sell it. Then buy it back at a much lower price and return it to MAGA bag holders.,Perfecshionism,2025-04-05T23:05:59,7
"'It was never this bad under Biden'  Inflation was a problem during Biden's admin, but it wasn't a problem of Biden's creation and his administration did a fantastic job of fixing actual inflation. When he left office, inflation was basically where it was when he started.  The bigger issue is that everything in our economy is run by massive corporations now, and they will NEVER lower their prices. Once the price of something goes up, it's basically permanent because corporate greed demands it. So people saw prices staying high and, in their infinite wisdom as well-informed, learned Americans decided it would be a good idea to kick out the team that fixed inflation and replace them with a team that every global economist predicted would destroy the economy.  Good job, America!",beenyweenies,2025-04-06T12:44:26,6
"They are right though. If the economy is gonna crash anyways you may as well try to benefit from it and buy stocks when they're low. The government is gonna bail them out there's just no way they don't, so might as well wait until the top 30 companies have crashed enough then swoop in and buy some cheap stocks before it goes back up.  Obviously it'd be better if it didn't crash, but if it's gonna crash you might as well get what you can out of it rather than simply standing around.",imnota4,2025-04-06T06:09:55,2

"The time bomb went off in his face. Or this would have been the end result if he had won reelection in 2020. No mater what, the plan is to have the bomb go off during the opposing party's term in office. The last few attempts didn't work.   It's always the wolves in Jesus's clothing that  destroy our democracy. As long his attempts at legacy building go unchecked, he is letting the dominant batch of  Christian and conservative intellectuals have a field day at the policy level. He's trying be remembered for bringing manufacturing back to America and they will let him destroy the economy in the doomed effort. Same with his ridiculous land grabs. He thinks it will get his face on Mt. Rushmore.  That is all he cares about! He is just itching to pull the civil war trigger.   He is going to start ramping up the rhetoric. A whole bunch of, ""I've been hearing..."" are coming. The protests and the states pursuing independent international trade agreements are going to be the fodder.   Sorry, I'm stoned.",alsatian01,2025-04-06T00:27:46,1
Yeah I agree it should really be based on percentage. If you make bad arguments when there are really good arguments on the table it just gives the other side a reason to write you off.,bongophrog,2025-04-06T02:47:07,1
"Why would you give him a pass. His administration scrapped the pandemic playbook and agency that had been set up by Obama admin. Then he politicized and downplayed the seriousness of COVID. He praised China while talking shit about U.S scientists and health agencies. He gave Russia medical equipment when we had shortages. He wasn‚Äôt honest with the citizens he was elected to lead. It‚Äôs a flu, it goes away in the spring etc.   His lies and rhetoric were worse than COVID itself. Then he admits to Bob Woodward that he didn‚Äôt want to create a panic‚Ä¶ Fuck the panic you destabilized our nation for your approval numbers and a new way to has American citizens fighting each other not looking at the crimes he committed.",[deleted],2025-04-06T06:45:09,6

"Trying to figure out when the dip bottoms out will be fun, considering The Great Depression started on¬†October 28, 1929, when the Dow declined nearly 13 percent. On the following day, Black Tuesday, the market dropped nearly 12 percent. By mid-November, the Dow had lost almost half of its value. And the¬†slide continued all the way through the summer of 1932, when the Dow closed at 41.22, its lowest value of the twentieth century. 89 percent below its peak. The Dow did not return to its pre-crash heights until¬†November of 1954.  So yeah. ‚ÄúThe Dip.‚Äù",Jackpot777,2025-04-07T07:14:28,1

"I don't disagree with a single word of that. But almost every leader during Covid has lost reelection.   I also think Hillary would've been trounced by covid (although she would've handled it much better. Republicans would still make it seem much worse).
