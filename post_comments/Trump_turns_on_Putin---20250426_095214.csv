The problem with Trump is that he's an empty vessel. People fight to run him at the White House. Now those goons are not present so he yields to Zelensky. He's gonna go back to D.C. and one of the goons will re-program him into loving Putin.,Secure_Plum7118,2025-04-26T09:57:09,154

"Trump ""turns on Putin""... He's fucking out. The EU and its allies are all in for Ukraine without the US. And unlike the US... They are not imposing limits on how Ukraine defends and attacks Russia.   Contrary to Western news... All of the Russians that moved into Crimea after it was stolen... went back to Russia. Russia is not technically ""occupying"" any land it took. It just has its soldiers there.   Putin's second largest bank is failing. It's infrastructure is in shambles outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. Russia is no longer a near peer force. Most of the country lives in third world conditions.",williamgman,2025-04-26T10:59:38,8

The optics on this are very interesting. But who doesn’t understand that Trump is a backstabbed coward who doesn’t have a shred of nobility inside his black soul? He’s a transactional robot who outright shits on democracy every chance he can. No chance he adjusts his weak stance on this.,orcinyadders,2025-04-26T10:22:33,5

"Um...  “Trump’s view is that this land has been seized and it is not going back,” a source close to Witkoff said. “The deal on the table is that the Russian-occupied territory is going to remain occupied.

….and then he will turn on Zelenskyy after Putin reels him back in. Whoever has his ear can fill his tiny brain with their position. He has no plan and has been winging it from the start.

"Personally, I'm starting to wonder if he's our first quantum president. One who holds all possible positions on important topics at all times, popping out here and there into our reality to completely contradict himself. The inane utterances of his supporters follows the same logic: he's doing this but also that but also more than you think he is but also not at all what you think he is. You can't pin him or them down to any one take.  Every single headline that describes him needs to begin with ""in a total contradiction to what he said/did a few minutes ago, a day ago, etc...."" Hit us over the head with the inconsistency and the uncertainty it generates. That's what reflects his true nature, his superposition if you will.",Plus-Map2796,2025-04-26T11:02:21,1
