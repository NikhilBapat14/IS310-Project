"Man here. I do not, for one second, want my wife to be subservient to me. She is my partner, an equal, her opinions and decisions matter just as much as mine. Our relationship is built on mutual trust and respect in every aspect of our lives together. A real Christian should operate on the same ideal (I use Christianity, since that's what they want to throw down everyone's throat of late). There should be nothing that limits or inhibits her wants, needs, and desires in any way because I exist and have my own wants, needs, and desires. We make decisions together, with the intention of bettering both of our lives as a result. That is healthy.   These fragile boys parading themselves as ""men of God"" are an embarrassment to every last word written in the Bible. And I will sit down, with a NIV/NKJ, whatever version they want, and I will tell them to their faces the very same, and use annotated scripture to prove it. I am so sick of these Christian cosplayers, I'd turned away from the faith for years to go on my own journey, these nimrods have driven me right back to it for the purpose of proving them wrong.",VengefulWalnut,2025-04-24T16:51:15,8

"Is anyone asking why they didn‚Äôt pick a man to head this? Since their position is that women are less important and less capable than men, it just seems odd that they‚Äôd have a woman head this. Maybe they think it‚Äôll be more convincing since women won‚Äôt be able to understand it if it came from a man and they needed a woman to explain it simple enough for them to understand.   I find it hypocritical at the very minimum and women should find it totally insulting and condescending.   The administration doesn‚Äôt seem to have a clue that women are the ones in many families and among couples who are the breadwinners and still do most of the unpaid housework, too. Maybe they do know that and that‚Äôs what they want to end.   This makes me so angry because it‚Äôs just wrong on so many levels. I‚Äôm pissed. I can only imagine how women must feel.

"> The White House Faith Office was established via an executive order in February, along with Attorney General Pam Bondi‚Äôs Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias.  Ok, so what the fuck is a ""White House Faith Office,"" and why are you flouting your complete disregard for the constitution?  And ""anti-christian bias"" huh? So it's not enough to have a white, Christian hegemony in this country for hundreds of years, but now you're some kind of protected class? Give me a break.  Youüëèareüëènotüëèvictims! Full stop...  Just because there has been a decline in recent years of religiously affiliated persons, does not mean you are being oppressed!  What's more, that decline has recently leveled off, but these lunatics are taking it to mean that ""Christianity is back!"" When in reality, it never went away in the first place.  Christians still make up a sizeable chunk of the population, and not only that, but they are still disproportionately represented in many areas of society, while their political, cultural and social capital remains comparatively high...  Ffs, do you not see the irony in lamenting ""anti-christian bias"" while you hold such a powerful platform and influential position?  But of course, a small decline in any of these things symbolizes some existential threat to white, heteronormative Christians everywhere.  > While speaking to Real America‚Äôs Voice host Steve Gruber on Wednesday, Cain praised men who are ‚Äúreturning‚Äù to church.  > Paula White-Cain, a senior adviser of President Donald Trump‚Äôs White House Faith Office, said in a recent interview that she ‚Äúsubmits‚Äù to her husband and that ‚ÄúGod designed‚Äù men to be leaders of a household.  > ‚ÄúGod is moving mightily, and what‚Äôs so exciting to me, it‚Äôs especially among young people and men. Men are the fastest returning to church,‚Äù White-Cain said.  First of all, gross... Secondly, is that really your interpretation?   > A study published last year by the Survey Center on American Life found that church membership was declining among young women in the U.S. at a higher rate than among young men.  Hmm, I WONDER WHY? What could possibly be turning women away from the church?  And again, it seems that this leveling off in male church membership is being misrepresented as some return to God...  Equality and diversity of beliefs is not the equivalent of persecution. For God's sake, and quite literally, stop acting like a bunch of entitled children! Your behavior is the very reason people have turned away from the church, don't you get it? You're only victims of your own ignorance, self-importance and intolerance!

"Yeah, she's submitted three times so far White has been married three times. Her first marriage was as a teenager. White became pregnant the year after converting to Christianity. She and the father, local musician Dean Knight, married in 1985; they divorced in 1989. White met associate pastor Randy White in 1987 while attending Damascus Church of God in Maryland, which was headed by his father. According to the book Holy Mavericks, meeting this third-generation preacher was a turning point in her life. The two divorced their spouses in 1989 and married each other a year later, White becoming stepmother to his children. Shortly thereafter, they moved to Tampa, Florida, and started Without Walls International Church. On August 23, 2007, Randy White announced that the couple were divorcing. According to The Christian Post, White says the divorce was amicable, and they remain friends. In 2010, White was photographed leaving a motel in Rome holding hands with televangelist Benny Hinn. Hinn said, ""A friendship did develop"", though ""the relationship is over"". Both denied an affair.  At the close of 2014, musician Jonathan Cain of the rock band Journey finalized his divorce from his second wife and became engaged to White, whom he had seen during his marriage. On April 27, 2015, the couple married, White becoming stepmother to his children.",PastryRoll,2025-04-24T17:40:28,1

Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.

What makes it hard for wives to submit to their husbands is our current culture.   Women are being pushed into being more masculine and whorish which attracts men short term but makes them want to stay alone or be more sexually demanding early in a relationship and that turns them into people who a good wife would NOT want to submit to.   It becomes a cyclical issue where both sides want the other to change without changing themselves.   Men want a nice woman without a troublesome past but they also want sex in a relationship since waiting till marriage is rare now especially since most women they date aren't virgins due to hookup culture so waiting seems unreasonable    Women want to have a man who is a strong and capable leader worth following who can provide love and security but they still want to be capable of having control over their own lives even when it goes against what the man would want,WFSTUDIOS,2025-04-25T02:40:48,0

Yeah, my view is judgmental as hell. I own that. But I‚Äôm tired of our collective inability to move past this shit. Back when we were living in caves, sure, we needed explanations for the chaos around us. Ground shaking and fire from the sky? Invisible monsters seemed like a reasonable enough guess, I suppose. Divine rules from an all-powerful being also served as a social moral binding agent to make sure humans didn't just exterminate themselves. That was pretty apt, and it made sense at the time. The idea of inescapable, eternal punishment? That‚Äôs the ultimate leverage. Add some sharp sticks and hierarchy, and you've got an empire cooking.  At some point, we started moving beyond our fear of the dark. We experimented and observed. We figured some shit out and were able to actually replicate some results that had a basis in reality. As usual, we got there despite religious ""authority"" fighting tooth and nail to stay in power and suppress anything that challenged their narratives. Organized religion is the ultimate source of greed - people subjugating and exploiting their own using terrors that they themselves invented.   Theologians much smarter than me can poke hundreds of holes in my rationale. I can only read so much, and frankly, I lack the intellectual horsepower required for making good arguments about metaphysics. Nonetheless, I‚Äôve yet to hear a theist give a coherent explanation of the natural order that doesn't boil down to ‚Äújust trust me, bro.‚Äù  I wouldn't give a shit if religious belief was just some personal comfort blanket that stayed in people‚Äôs heads. If someone wants to believe the moon is made of green cheese, fine. But that‚Äôs not how this works.

"She's like Amy Semple McPherson who became a millionaire traveling evangelist and faith healer in the early 1900s. Her 3rd and last marriage was to a doctor (iirc) she was having an affair with while he was still married. She got national news coverage for disappearing for a few weeks, claiming she'd been kidnapped and escaped, even though she didn't even have a mark on her, and during the police investigation several people reported seeing her in a beach community in SoCal where the doctor had a vacation home.

"It seems you're really focused on the wives submitting to husbands part and the greater context of husbands doing a similar state of love and affection towards their wives and moreso everyone submitting to one another just isn't crossing your radar.  If you don't like the word submit, you could associate it with serving but the context still has wives serving their husbands while husbands serve and love their wives. Wives serving husbands like people in church serve Christ does seem a bit off and concerning but husbands are called to serve and love their wives like Christ does the church and he did so to the point of dying for the church, thus calling husbands to that level of dedication and sacrifice. And again this is still under the framework that everyone serve one another in reverence to Christ. We're called to be in service to one another, to ""submit"" to one another. People acting in service to themselves and submitting to their own desires is why we're where we are right now. At least in a spiritual context. There's also a whole love language context here which I don't quite want to dig into but we can if you want?      It's weird and easier said than done. But from a biblical context that's what should be being expressed. There might be some vibes in Biblical context that seem pretty limiting to women but check out Proverbs 31 sometimes. That's some pretty classy action. Heck, I think other places in Proverbs  personifies wisdom as a woman for what it's worth though they do have another morally dubious woman to contrast wisdom too so...-\_-",wasante,2025-04-25T03:20:09,1
Men are also doing the same except they are becoming more feminine which adds to them not being the leaders women would gladly submit to.   Like I said.

"If *all* Americans who last week called themselves Trump supporters also identified as Christian, then yes: as many as 2/3rds of American Christians support Trump.   If approval of Trump is consistent across religious affiliation then only 40% of Christians would support him‚Äîwhile most would not.  Here are the numbers.  In 2024, America was 62% Christian. Last week, 40% of all Americans polled said they approved of Trump.  If the *only* people who say they approve of Trump are Christian Americans, then only just over a third of Christian Americans do not approve of him. That definitely counts as most of them approving, though odds are good it wasn‚Äôt just Christian Americans.  If Trump approval is even across all Americans, then 62% of the 40% who approve are Christians. That‚Äôs 24.8% of all Americans, or only 40% of American Christians‚Äînot most.   So odds are great that he‚Äôs hanging on to more Christian voters than he‚Äôs alienating, with numbers between 66% best-case and as low as 40% worst-case‚Äîat least today. Large and vocal groups have flipped in recent months, with 56% of younger men having voting for him in 2024 though only 34% of that same group approve of him now.

"It IS tho. Because if we don‚Äôt address the issues causing women to vote against their interests then how are you going to elect a woman in this country?  A lot of men see a patriarchy as being in their best interest and they vote as such. They‚Äôre a much harder block to turn to our side.   It should seemingly be easier to get women to vote for women, logically, right?  And in this case, yea, the point is a lot of women seem to be voting to be second class citizens.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt address men and their voting habits. It means you can accomplish more with less work figuring out why women are voting against their interests and figuring out how to message them better.    But yea, according to your analogy, in this case a surprisingly large number of ‚Äúslaves‚Äù do seem to be choosing to be ‚Äúslaves.‚Äù   I don‚Äôt know about you, but that should warrant some study.",Area51_Spurs,2025-04-24T18:31:02,-1
"I feel like a larger number want to be submissive or subservient and have a more traditional housewife role (but not full on tradwife) than we‚Äôve been led to believe. At least white women it would seem.   I feel like the cause is economic that they want to have the option of being a stay at home mom and going back to be stereotypical 50‚Äôs type nuclear family we think of from TV and the movies.   I feel like men and women who have a lot of views of women not working and being at home aren‚Äôt necessarily starting from a fully unhealthy place, but the only people discussing wanting to have single income households be a thing again are misogynistic and religious.   I think what it really is is people wanting the American dream of being able to raise a family with the option of a parent being around to parent the kids.  I feel like feminism gets misinterpreted (purposely) by the leaders of the right wing into being about women working and not being there for their kids when in reality feminism is about providing women with the ability to choose what they want in life and how they want to go about it and providing them the same entrepreneurial, educational, and societal opportunities as men that would allow them to generate their own income and independence, while being a mother, if they decide to be a mother.   It gets twisted by the right that because of feminism you have to have two incomes. But that‚Äôs not it. It‚Äôs because of greed by corporations and the wealthy that we need two incomes to get half what our parents and grandparents had with one.   I feel like many women who vote for Trump don‚Äôt really want the tradwife submissive lifestyle, they want to have the freedom and options of not slaving away and scraping by like we have now.   I really hope I explained that well. It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain properly without coming off as saying ‚Äúwomen yearn for the ~~mines~~ kitchen‚Äù or something.   I think a lot of men also subscribe to these beliefs for the same reasons. A single income household like the picture in a 50‚Äôs sitcom allows men to have a lot more freedom and less responsibility.   I think that‚Äôs what the bullshit of Make America Great Again taps into. Wanting to go back to what people picture the post war period in their minds. But they see it through rose tinted glasses that don‚Äôt show the racism, domestic violence, abuse, shackles of being unable to leave a bad marriage, negative societal pressures, etc‚Ä¶",Area51_Spurs,2025-04-24T19:10:38,2

"Definition of ""extinction burst:""  >An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, or duration of a behavior when it no longer produces the reinforcement that was previously associated with it.    In individual psychology, this is the term for the sort of tantrums you see if a behavior that usually results in a desired outcome or reward, no longer produces them. A person or animal will start re-enacting that behavior in ever-more-fervent outbursts, trying to get the desired result. Train a mouse that ""push this button and get a piece of cheese"" for a bit, then stop sending the cheese. The mouse will push the button harder/more often trying to get it to work. Then give up later.   The... optimistic take, I've seen on this, is that this particular strain of American conservatism - the ""traditional values"" ""law and order"" ""family values"" mindset has been culturally ostracized. It no longer produces respect or admiration from the community to be a ""manly man"" in the sense of Tim Allen or Ron Swanson.   Instead of just quietly giving up, they're doubling down, to try to get that respect/power back. Super-toxic-masculinity takes online. ""Trad"" movements. MAGA. It's all a hysterical outburst to try to reclaim that mythologized place at the top of the food chain.  And when it keeps not working - when they continue to be laughed at or ignored for their big trucks and their guns, when their version of ""humor"" continues to get more derision than laughter, when their political takes continue to make life worse instead of better- they'll eventually give up.   All it really takes is, well, for them to figure out there's no cheese coming out anymore.

I know a trad couple and they manage it really well as they are a genuine team.  They have their roles but work hard to complement each others role and assist where necessary.  Simply, they are amazing humans.  Unfortunately they are not the norm due to loads of people not being taught the skills to negotiate, support, empathize and break out of own role when needed.    Too many males believe they are the god of the house and should be treated as such.  Too many women are taught to be meek, kind and blindly support and tolerate their man.

"Its a tough topic, I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with 'old fashioned' gender role dynamics on a relationship basis as long as that is the what the couple wants.  Not every relationship needs to fit in any particular box. but that comes with massive caveats in real world practice of course as societal pressures and insular institutions push an agenda that has many other facets and elements that can be abusive in nature to say the least.  I think the crux of the issue is that both sides enact there own versions of purity tests when agency and freedom are the real goal.  The ""Woke"" argument needs to be one of freedom, inclusion and understanding.  The right are masterful at taking the worst parts (ideologues) of the counter movement to theirs and paint them as unreasonable, and make it a us vs them affair when in reality most of us don't care what they get up to in their communities.  I guess what I am trying to say is we need to leave the purity test for the -isms to the religious nutjobs, they have way more practice.  We need to focus on social economic issues and inclusion of a broader tent as in my humble opinion the issues we collectively care about will be much easier to solve once we can fix the broken system we find ourselves in, and maybe if we can do that we can not get so worked up over genitals and skin color.",T8rfudgees,2025-04-24T17:00:41,2

"Well, I doubt the real Timothy would've ever know of the letter's existence either.  Scholars date the three letters I mentioned (the pastoral epistles) to early 2nd century due to its language and the topics it discuss.  Meanwhile, Paul died sometime in the mid 1st century; hence, he couldn't have written those letters.  Timothy of Ephesus died around 97 CE, so he probably won't have anything to do with the epistles named after him either.  The most likely event is that some successor of Timothy ""found"" a letter written to his (now-dead) predecessor from Paul which just so happens to line up with his own personal views of how things should be.  The history of the Bible is actually quite fascinating if you examine it from a purely academic and literary standpoint.",nightwyrm_zero,2025-04-24T20:07:49,1

Key differences between Canada and the USA are that the USA has an economy 10x bigger and a military unmatched by any county on the planet.  That's why the billionaire assholes focused on taking it before Canada. America is a much bigger prize.

"I can't remember where and I can't be arsed on this beautiful saturday googling, but somewhere the algorithms between males and females has skewed significantly, driving males way out towards the right and women way out on the left.  In a small number of years there will be some interesting research on the monumental insanity that a totally unfettered social media has driven.    Don't worry.... Research into surviving car accidents is still skewed towards males, same with the signs and symptoms of heart attack.  I probably shouldn't mention the average of I think 10ish years to get a diagnosis and treatment for endometriosis - which is horrifically painful and can easily destroy the person's fertility.  Probably about time we all realized that if your not on the multimillionaire list we're all being screwed by the system - which is a feature not a bug.
