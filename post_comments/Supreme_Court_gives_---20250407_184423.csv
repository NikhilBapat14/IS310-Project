"This is not the win for Trump they’re making it out to be, which I think is the point.  They say he can deport people but he does have to use due process.   So Trump gets a “win” with conditions that undermine the abusive potential the administration would consider as utility.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-07T18:48:34,1

Who determines what due process is? An inch is a mile with this admin.,watcherofworld,2025-04-07T18:49:29,1
you forget he was given immunity to break the law if it’s on official business. who’s to say he won’t just be like oh well i deported them because of the safety of america!!!! or whatever just saying it’s a diplomatic move.,Akraxs,2025-04-07T19:07:41,1
I don't feel optimistic about this. What's stopping trump from just continuing to ignore due process?,sachiprecious,2025-04-07T19:10:20,1
"Why, because they ruled that people have the right to due process before they are deported? Or did you not read the article?",Ernesto_Bella,2025-04-07T18:55:15,1
Agreed. Shame how politicized the branch has become--the exact thing the founders warned AGAINST.,Traditional_Quail297,2025-04-07T18:47:08,1
"   From the decision:  >More specifically, in this context, AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.  You're not wrong though that the administration will try to stretch the line as far as they can.",SwimmingThroughHoney,2025-04-07T18:53:35,1

"Except those who were already disappeared. Those people don't have that right. Too bad.  Also, people are allowed to be skeptical. The administration has made every attempt to avoid habeas corpus - which isn't an esoteric concept -, it will continue to do so.",gelatineous,2025-04-07T19:21:54,1
We should not be deporting people to that prison.....period.  Due process or not.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-07T19:10:39,1

"But then he can just ignore that ruling.  Yes, I'm very pessimistic when it comes to this administration.",sachiprecious,2025-04-07T19:24:16,1
Notice will be in the form of a small print notification on page 8 of the local newspaper.,Skrivus,2025-04-07T20:31:56,1
