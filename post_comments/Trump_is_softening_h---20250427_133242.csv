"He thought he was dealing with one of his contractors; withhold final payments, wait for a Lien, draw out settling until the contractor has to accept way less or end up bankrupt with their creditors negotiating for pennies. He doesn‚Äôt try this with the larger companies, who can withstand fighting, or whose services he needs again.                    Which really tells you how he views America vs. the world; he sees the US as the ultimate superpower every country depends on and he can use that to exploit them. He thought he held the cards, could apply pressure and wait for countries to panic when their economies took a hit and then they‚Äôd come ‚Äúkiss his ass‚Äù for a deal.               He wanted to bully countries into ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù by applying harsh penalties and saying, ‚ÄúFigure out a deal that will make me want to remove it.‚Äù Then he stupidly said ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù when the first countries tried to deal. He gave ridiculous counter offers. He showed his hand. He was working with nothing and wanting everything. And he stupidly did this to *every country* **at the same time,** not thinking that they‚Äôd just start negotiating amongst themselves, instead.       Now he is panicking. The US economy is hurting and those countries aren‚Äôt running to him, begging for a deal.       He already destroyed decades of US diplomacy and trust. He destroyed any confidence in US security and alliances by threatening NATO and invading allies. He destroyed US foothold in third world countries (USAID) through soft power.  The US was the country, other countries wanted to make deals with, trust as a security partner and invest in.      Trump had destroyed US Diplomacy and he did so at the expense of the US economy. The question is, will it have a major effect on the dollar? Will it affect the trust of the dollar? What effect will it have on oil, gas, energy and food? On world investment? On security?        I don‚Äôt think Americans understand how they benefitted from their decades of diplomacy, the US dictated a lot of world policy. And maybe that‚Äôs on the American government and politicians. Unfortunately, I think it‚Äôll all be gone before they ever have a chance of realizing what they had.       And this is not considering the current dismantling of the government institutions, disregard of law and the judicial, and disregard for the constitution; the single document that *made* American.

"A big problem with an administration (mostly the president, though), that has total disregard for facts and uses outright lying to herald success when the actual data implies the opposite is a great propaganda tool, but not a great economic indicator. We honestly don‚Äôt know how bad things are because even though we get bad numbers, they‚Äôll all still sugar coated to some degree. The only somewhat reliable indicators are polls, which aren‚Äôt as reliable since most people don‚Äôt answer telephone or door to door polls and when you have a  fair sized percentage of MAGA people who just restate what they‚Äôve been told and not what they themselves have actually experienced, that throws things off. It has a national/local problem where they hear that things are good or bad everywhere, except locally that doesn‚Äôt match, so they may respond with a national assessment that they can‚Äôt verify instead of a local one that they can. So, the polls are likely more in line with the national talking points and less with actual unbiased answers about their particular neck of the woods. Just like the weather and almost every government reporting source, the raw data, while not being totally cooked, is still being reheated or plated to look better or different than it is. In short, lies, fabrications, and political biases aren‚Äôt to be totally trusted. The trends may still be helpful, but don‚Äôt count too much on it.   However, numbers and trends from non-US sources should be more reliable since they represent the whole world and not our walled off part of it. Are all the other countries lying in a conspiracy to make the US look bad? The number of independent sources suggest otherwise, although a near unanimous dislike for Trump and his policies may modify word choices, they don‚Äôt change numbers. (I hate calling them policies since they don‚Äôt seem planned and different agency heads and official mouthpieces are not in total sync on simple things they should be.) But, they‚Äôre likely a lot more accurate than those from within the US.   Damage is also relative. If you can find alternate markets to offset or at least reduce dependence on other supply chains, it‚Äôs temporary issue. If non-trust or instability or embargo‚Äôs of exports of key items that inflict shortages as a weapon, those impacts can be devastating in the short term. Nudging a mule to move along is not the same as poking it with a stick and our ‚Äúbeautiful deals‚Äù offer few if any carrots and are more about wielding sticks.   We won‚Äôt know the extent of damage until looking back on it, not very different from knowing if you‚Äôre in a recession or not without looking back at consecutive quarters.   What there is near unanimous agreement on (other than from the White House) is that everybody everywhere was is better shape before the tariff war(s) and reversals and reimplemented changes to them were ever put in place. It started before ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù, but that was a hot mess with too much all at once based on obviously erroneous numbers derived from trade deficits and fairy dust and not on actual tariff rates themselves. If Trump would only keep his mouth shut, stop posting, and not taking any actions other than repealing most tariffs still in place, that‚Äôs our best chance of minimizing even more damage on top of what he already can‚Äôt undo.",Mike-ggg,2025-04-28T07:44:50,1
