"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpts:  > Since Trump took office, oil drillers’ stocks have plummeted, crude prices have tumbled and gasoline prices remain stubbornly high. In the biggest oil field in the U.S., dismayed frackers are starting to reconsider their drilling plans because they anticipate demand for their product to weaken—in part as a result of Trump’s erratic shifts on trade.  > [...]  > Together, America’s crop of oil-and-gas companies lost more than $280 billion in stock-market value between April 2, when Trump unveiled his tariff blitz, and Monday. That sum is larger than the market cap of Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company. The industry’s aggregate drop in market value has outpaced that of every other major sector.   > Among the biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon and Chevron shares have declined 11% and 18%, respectively. Oil-field services giant Schlumberger and its top rivals, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, have fallen between 21% and 23%. Those companies are bellwethers for activity in the U.S. oil patch.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-01T23:50:52,8

"Gotta give Trump Credit. He's done the most damage to the American oil industry since OPEC.  Thank you, Comrade Donald! A collectivized energy sector will rise from the ashes of the oil barons. Hopefully our friends from across the pond do the same to BP and Shell.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-02T04:48:40,2
