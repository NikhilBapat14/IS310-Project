I remain confused about the goal of the Left by adding El Salvadorian gangsters to their roster of marginalized groups.,Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-20T15:26:04,56
"It seems the left always picks the worst possible people to be the face of their causes. We have this MS13 member, surely in the billions of people already deported there wasn’t a honest hard working family man who paid his taxes, put his kids through college with no loans and was just enjoying retirement only to get ripped out of his home? Is the domestic abuser the best they got? The one who will get sympathy?  Also George Floyd.. you mean to tell me in this hellscape of police brutality he’s the best they could come up with?  Couldn’t find someone who didn’t abuse a pregnant woman?",chillthrowaways,2025-04-21T05:53:10,3

"This was Master play by the administration. Senate bro thought he was on solid ground when he boarded the flight, but then Miller and company started releasing additional stuff about the guy bit by bit. The trump card was of course having Trump show the picture of the guy with him as 13 tattooed on his knuckles. I can't believe Van Halen showed his face on the Sunday shows today",vegatx40,2025-04-20T14:34:21,28
