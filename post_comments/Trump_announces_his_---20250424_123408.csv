Reagan, Clinton and Obama would have definitely been 3 term presidents, Reagan was garbage and a third term would have been bad, but I’ll take a third Reagan term in exchange for the erasure of George W Bush and Donald Trumps presidencies from the history book, no way those two could have defeated Clinton or Obama.   Moving on from the hypotheticals, Amendments are hard to make happen and even harder to get rid of, so the 22nd Amendment isn’t going anywhere, that doesn’t necessarily stop Trump from running again, if he wants to run again he’s just going to suspend the constitution and not leave the White House, he’s already tried once, he will likely try again.

What's actually happened for decades is the Republican party kicks the Democratic party in the balls over and over and over and OVER again and the sole response the Democratic party gives is to go ""would you please stop that?"" if they bother to react at all.

"Agreed I don’t just ignore trumpets now I link sources to videos of trump speaking things, links to his executive orders, and links to each amendment or paragraph in the constitutuon that is being broken and explain what words mean. In public when I hear someone make fun of a marginalized person, the housemates I rent to are two of my best friends and they’re trans, they kick ass too but I don’t mind standing up for them. Letting them get away unpunished for open hatred, racism and bigotry. They started this, they fired the first shots THEY ARE SENDING PEOPLE TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR LIFE WITHOUT TRIAL OR CHARGES TO BEGIN WITH. That means it can happen to anyone who looks or sounds slightly foreign. A speech impediment might get you deported because they’re too stupid to know the difference between an accent and impediment. And there’s no time to prove anything without due process. JUDGES ARE GETTING ARRESTED. There is nothing left but to fight fire with fire for some people and I get why. I know people who have lost substantial portions of 401ks, are scared to go in public, but now ICE DOESNT NEED WARRANTS TO ENTER ANY HOME as of today. Hopefully the Supreme Court realizes that’s unconstitutional as well and fucking stops it.
