"Never forget, Harris actually presented a plan to lower prices and make living more affordable for the middle class.  Trump just said it would magically happen on his first day in office.",aaron_adams,2025-04-30T08:35:52,41

"I refuse to believe Hank would still be a Magaggot (Maggot). Definitely can see first term. Maybe early in the 24 election cycle. But never ever would he be one still. Peggy, yes I can definitely see her. But Hank would have had an existential crisis and vote for Kamala in the end. ",Wise_Championship273,2025-04-30T08:25:47,4

he always was. I had a guy tell egg prices are good again because they aren't as high as they were but couldn't understand me telling them that being 5x as expensive instead of 10x is still a bad thing.,in1gom0ntoya,2025-04-30T13:02:06,2
He said what he needed to say in order to get elected including distancing himself from project 2025 with his agenda 47. I don’t believe he’s smart enough to come up with what he’s doing now on his own.,Johnqpublic25,2025-04-30T16:58:43,2

That's the issue with the media. They look at the plan and criticize it but look at Trump's fantasy and report it as if it was reasonable,mr_birkenblatt,2025-04-30T08:56:12,23
My neighbor used to have a sign that literally said this. Has recently taken it down ,Redwolfdc,2025-04-30T12:06:03,4
I don’t think any of them would be except maybe Bill or Dale. I think Hank and Peggy would have both been never trumpers from the beginning.,Beautiful-Year-6310,2025-04-30T12:53:47,5
