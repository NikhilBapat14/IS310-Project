"Excerpts:  On Monday evening, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker began a marathon floor speech to break the record that the odious Dixiecrat Strom Thurman set when he filibustered the Civil Rights Act on 1957 for 24 hours and 17 minutes. The symbolism of Booker, a Black senator, doing that was obvious and excellent under our current circumstances, where the Trump administration is doing everything it can to erase the story of racial minorities in American life. But I had no idea how thrilling it would be to see him stand there for what turned out to be 25 hours and 4 minutes and lay out the case against what Trump and the Republicans are doing. He opened his speech by saying:  “These are not normal times in our nation. And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.""   Apparently, it thrilled a lot of people. According to The Hill, ""more than 350 million people liked the speech on TikTok live, as the senator approached 25 hours of holding the floor in the Senate chamber."" Hundreds of thousands of people watched it on C-SPAN. CNN and MSNBC all carried portions of it live throughout the afternoon. And what he said was great. No reading from the phone book or ""Green Eggs and Ham."" No matter when you tuned in, he was telling it like it is, for 25 straight hours with passion, insight, inspiration and empathy, like something out of a Frank Capra movie.   And then came Tuesday's election returns. The two Florida races were won by Republicans as expected — but by about 15 points, half the margin Trump received last November. The big one in Wisconsin was a banger. I'd certainly paid attention in recent days to Elon Musk's antics there, where he poured more than $20 million into the right-wing candidate's campaign and handed out million-dollar checks along with other cash goodies. He made the race a referendum on himself, even turning up in person on Sunday to tell people that it would be the end of America if the liberal won.  That didn't work out for him. The liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, won by 10 points. The upshot is that Musk's threats to spend millions to punish rogue Republicans in primaries and Democrats in the general may not be quite as ominous as previously thought. The more people get to know him, the less they like what they see.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-02T10:17:07,7

"55% to 45% is considered a tight race lmao...but when Trump wins the popular vote by a 1.5% margin, maga calls it a ""mandate"".  That ten percent margin is a mandate and shows that the people have spoken.",Flat-Count9193,2025-04-02T10:41:08,4
