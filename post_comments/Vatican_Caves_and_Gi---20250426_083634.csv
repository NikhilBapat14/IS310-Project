"Well, obviously Italy has its reasons to accommodate Trump, and since Italy is paying for and arranging all security it’s a smart win to place him front row. And yes, Trump is a scumbag who does not deserve this respect, but here we are",Erewhon2022,2025-04-26T09:56:52,-1
"No, people did not cave immediately in 2016. Many did start immediately bribing him, like Novartis, but when caught, they rescinded the bribe. Because it wasn't certain yet if American voters would approve of blatant corruption and fascism.  It took 10 years to build this kind of confidence. It's clear only after 2 impeachments, Jan 6 coup attempt, winning popular vote, securing all 3 branches, that absolutely nothing will change the resolve of the majority of voters.  So as the madman dictator threatens to throw Ukraine to the wolves, all anyone can do is attempt to play to his ego.",kiwigate,2025-04-26T10:01:06,24
"Because he’s acting like an authoritarian bully. His whole thing is making your life a living nightmare if you do something he doesn’t like. This takes different forms, of course, depending on how vulnerable the target is.   A big problem here is that it is much harder for institutions to have the courage necessary to oppose him. Opposing Trump invariably involves some kind of immediate personal risk; a person can justify that on principle, or with the expectation that when enough people do this, he’ll bend (which has always been true!). But an institution can’t always think that far ahead; the courage there is more negative-sum.",Momik,2025-04-26T13:26:37,1
What I'm picking up from your comment is a slight degree of skepticism about the possibility of Trump's imminent demise.,crazybones,2025-04-26T12:46:06,3

"I agree that Trump is extremely evil — and I think generally speaking it's probably splitting hairs to try to litigate comparative levels of evil — so I'm not attempting to start a debate by saying this. But for the sake of anyone who might stumble across this thread, I think it's also important to keep in mind that Kissinger's list of war crimes is extensive, and directly resulted in [as many as 3 million deaths](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-10-conflicts-countries-that-define-a-blood-stained-legacy) according to some counts.",illiteral,2025-04-26T13:39:41,1

"[This video](https://youtu.be/GidbEhL0teE?si=8ZB14rQSKT63y7k2) has the clip with the line, but some backstory is that Harriet Jones, the Prime Minister in the clip, was a character that the Doctor knew for a long time, through regenerations. She was considered a trustworthy ally and is an example of what power and responsibility can do to people in politics, IMO.  After the line, >!we find out that Harriet Jones has received a vote of no confidence after rumors of illness. The line is meant to undermine confidence in Jones, remove her from power, but without anything catastrophic or harmful to the country.!<  I'll say, the whole 4 minute clip is worth it because it shows the trust they had in each other, the respect, then the moment where she does something he considers so unspeakably awful, quite literally behind his back, and then the line.
