"The guy is a Republican. He's tongue in cheek proposing giving the homeless all the fentanyl they want. Not for pleasure, but for the inevitable ODs.   Subtle?  Not at all. But by taking the left's position (free stuff for the poor and indigent) to the logical extreme he's making a point.",Horror_Conclusion,2025-04-20T07:30:00,184

"No one likes it, but we need to return to forced hospitalization. Few can overcome addition alone, and it is inhumane to let people die on the streets.",thinkingisthehardest,2025-04-20T18:01:55,17

"![gif](giphy|11mwI67GLeMvgA)  Thatâ€™s one way to do it! ðŸ¤£  MAN do these people not have a single braincell rattling upstairs! They donâ€™t give a shit about regular Californians with a 9 to 5 who lose family members to this absolutely garbage drug that shouldnâ€™t exist, only to flip the tune switch to outrage mode the moment that the homeless come under fire.  The Democrat Party isnâ€™t just the party of totalitarian communism, but the party of idiocy too.  And to every single Democrat lurker that I canâ€™t see whoâ€™s gonna downvote this comment, why donâ€™t YOU donate to the homeless, hm?",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-20T06:39:08,28
"We need to find a way to get back to only heroin and stop fentanyl. Yes both are bad but fentanyl is way way easier to overdose on then heroin is. MAYBE DECRIMINALIZE HEROIN AND MAKE FENTANYL A MORE SERIOUS FELONY. OR SOMETHING THAT GETS BACK TO DEALING ONLY HEROIN AND NOT FENTANYL.   I'm clean now but im a recovering heroin addict.  Most addicts would prefer heroin instead of fentanyl, myself included.    The high of fentanyl is honestly garbage. It's 20 minutes, heroin is several hours. Fentanyl just knocks u out, heroin has an actual euphoric feeling.",craig_52193,2025-04-21T11:50:56,1
See how compassionate this man is. I bet he believes in climate change as well.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-21T12:09:12,1
Only as dead as they want to be,Pwarky,2025-04-20T09:49:15,87
