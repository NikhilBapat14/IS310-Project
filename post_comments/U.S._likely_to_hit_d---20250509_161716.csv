"Did I hear right during Kristi Noem’s hearing the other day that by July she’ll have spent all the money budgeted for Homeland Security for the year?   We are the ones paying for her trips, photo-ops, her cosmetic dental procedures & her facelifts, right? All so she can look like a 60-year-old streetwalker?  How many of these other Trump people are pissing away our money like this?",jl56649,2025-05-09T16:24:36,32
I hope you're preparing. Empty shelves are coming. Inceases in inflation are coming. Recession is coming. The X date will topple the country and the world into depression if they don't address it and the Rebublicans can't craft a budget or govern. I'm 63 years old and I thinglk it would not by hyperbole to say that we could see the worst economic conditions. I guess Trump will get to crow about gas being lower because nobody is driving anywhere but I guess he didn't consider that oil prices that low will decimate the local oil industry,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-09T17:37:06,7
