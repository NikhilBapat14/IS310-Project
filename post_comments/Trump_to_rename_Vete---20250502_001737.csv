"> Trump also announced he would rename Victory in Europe Day, which is commemorated on May 8, to “Victory in World War II Day” to recognize that “we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II.”  …three months before the actual anniversary of the end of World War II.",ScotTheDuck,2025-05-02T00:28:16,41

WWII was against the fascists. Trump likes fascists for obvious reasons. So he can’t be celebrating allied victories against fascism.,Zazen1372,2025-05-02T02:47:26,4

Veteran’s Day was already stupidly renamed in 1954. We should go back to the original name: Armistice Day.   We took a day that was about celebrating peace and renamed it to make it a celebration of war.,New_Independent5819,2025-05-02T05:50:53,2
