"This article in the “Latin Times” discusses a study by the “Washington Post” presenting evidence that 12 US citizens have been “deported” by Trump so far this year.   In one case mentioned in this article a 4-year-old boy who is a US citizen and who has cancer was sent to Honduras because his mother is undocumented.   Remember how Trump dealt with people who rioted at the Capitol, vandalized government property, and attacked police officers? He pardoned them…   But how does he deal with a 4-year-old US citizen with cancer whose mother is undocumented? He banishes him to Honduras! If he could pardon people who attacked police officers, why can’t he pardon the mother of a 4-year-old US citizen with cancer?  This comparison tells us a lot about the putrid evil festering in Trump’s heart. He has “mercy” for violent criminals. He has no mercy for a 4-year-old US citizen with cancer…. There is no understanding of justice here. No human feeling.  What an evil man Trump is.  What an evil country he is creating.",JoeGRC,2025-05-06T10:47:03,29
"It is important that we get the language right on this.   A US Citizen **cannot** be deported to another country.  When a US citizen is sent to another nation, against their will and without a demand of extradition... That is **exile**.  Exile is categorically illegal per the text and case law regarding the 14th and 8th amendments of the Constitution.  Any person who has knowingly or unknowingly carried out an order that exiles a US citizen has committed the crime ""Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law"" [18 U.S.C. § 242](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242), similarly any member of our military service who assists in the exile of a US Citizen is carrying out an illegal order and is subject to court martial.",code_archeologist,2025-05-06T11:00:18,29

At least 12 illegal acts by deporting 12 US Citizens. tRump is truly an evil man with dementia.,Harry_Mud,2025-05-06T10:57:58,13
"When an authoritarian rules a country, he can break as many laws as possible without fear of being taken into custody (once he takes ALL power in a country, so no one can impeach him). Trump is undeniably a dictator, and the United States is now inarguably a dictatorship.",Hazer_123,2025-05-06T11:24:55,3
"I don’t see any evidence in that article that 12 citizens were “deported”. A few were detained and then released once they proved they were citizens. The others are minor children whose non-citizen custodial parent or parents were deported. The parents may not have been given sufficient opportunity to surrender custody of their children or perhaps they didn’t want to. Either way, the children were not deported.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T12:43:29,-3
This is according to a federal government that has been caught lying so many times that it has become cliche... and is about to be held in contempt by multiple federal judges for not telling the truth in a court of law.,code_archeologist,2025-05-06T14:34:57,5

"Yes, he *wants* to have totalitarian power.  And he is following the pattern of Hitler, Mussolini and others.  But there is one aspect of those historical takeovers that he does not have, all of them started their climb to totalitarian power from a point of economic and societal malaise.  Trump supporters believe that there is an economic malaise, but in reality the US economy (prior to Trump taking office) was very strong and projected to experience an ideal 2% growth over the 2025 fiscal year.  Trump has crashed that growth to where the projection is now a recessionary -0.1% contraction.  Previous totalitarian leaders gained popularity by handing out jobs, money, and national pride to societies that had been suffering up to a decade of decline.  Trump is very visibly causing a decline from what was a comfortable position... as a result his popularity is abysmal and only sinking.  For those historical leaders, when they seized total power under the guise of a national emergency the majority of the populace cheered it because on the surface things looked and felt better for them... they trusted that leader.  If Trump tries to do the same, with the popularity that he currently has and the country on the decline because of him, he is going to face a forceful (and likely kinetic) response in return.",code_archeologist,2025-05-06T12:01:41,4

"You are the only one making that disingenuous argument.  The better solution was to allow the US citizen parent time to be contacted to collect the child.  The mothers were pressured under duress, with no information about what would happen to their children if they did not take them.  You can make excuses all you want, what was done was illegal, immoral, and disgusting.  Just like those who support it.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T16:19:50,3
So you think the child should stay with their mother?,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T14:58:54,-4
"I agree, it probably was illegal or at least a breach of the rules concerning child custody.  International treaties prohibit children from crossing international borders without both parent’s permission. As for morality, you can’t expect that from the MAGAs, their leader is a convicted felon. However, that doesn’t mean the children were deported or exiled. If they have another parent in the  US who is a citizen, that parent can take fly out of the US to meet their children and bring them back.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T16:30:18,0
I think any normal and moral person would say that 4-year-old US citizens should stay in the United States WITH their mothers.,JoeGRC,2025-05-06T17:42:15,3
Your argument is as dumb as it is cruel.  You are assuming the parent in the states can afford to do so.  You are assuming no harm comes to the parent and child who were removed in the meantime.  You are assuming they will be treated justly upon their return by the same terrorist regime that sent them out.  You are making excuses for the literal Nazi party that has taken root in Washington.  Stop carrying water for monsters.,Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T16:37:41,3
"So in your view the mother of a child who is a US citizen should automatically gain US permanent residency when the child is born?  You are aware, I assume, that  a change in immigration law would be required? Such a change might be possible if the Democrats win back both houses of Congress and the Whitehouse in 2028. Right now, that isn't really an option if the mother is ruled deportable.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T18:02:09,-4
"Do you have an alternative solution for this family that is more cost effective? It's easy to complain about how awful the Trump regime but we can at least try to stick to the facts when doing so. It is not true that this children were deported and not true that they were ""exiled"". Unlike someone who was deported (the US does not exile citizens), they can return. Suggesting they cannot is both dishonest and unhelpful.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T17:22:43,0
"The president has legal authority to defer removal of individuals subject to deportation. This is from the National Immigration Law Center:  ""Deferred action. Immigration law, regulations, and courts recognize deferred action, a decision to defer the removal of individuals as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Legal authority for deferred action comes from Congress’s grant of authority to DHS to administer and enforce the immigration laws. Regulations describe deferred action as “an act of administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority \[for enforcement action\].” Federal courts have acknowledged executive power to grant deferred action since at least the 1970s.""  Deferred action seems massively justified in the case of an undocumented immigrant mother, whose 4-year-old son is a US citizen. It could be used to keep the mother here with her son until he comes of age. For a moral person that would seem like an obvious solution here.",JoeGRC,2025-05-07T11:25:37,1
"Your symantic game about ""deported/exiled"" is silly.  They were illegally removed from the country.  As for a cheaper alternative, yes.  Give the mother due process.  That would have allowed her time to speak with her husband long enough to make plans, and allow her to remain until her child is handed off.  Plus, it saves the US taxpayer all these dollars now spent on legal fee's and what I am sure will be a heafty civil suit.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T17:56:31,3
Well this President is not obviously not a moral person and he hates deferred action so this is obviously not a solution here. You need to come up with a solution that doesn't rely on the discretion of a racist.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-07T11:52:42,1
"In legal cases, the meaning of words is very important even if they seem silly to you. Should the mother have been given the opportunity to transfer custody of any children who were US citizens, absolutely. Was she given that opportunity, I have no idea. The child who needs medical treatment and is a US citizen should return to the US ASAP.  I don't understand why all the lawyers involved in this case haven't helped the parents arrange this already.   According the the Trump administration, in both cases the mothers benefited from due process. One had a final order of deportation issued in 2020 (along with an older child), the other in 2015. In the case where there were two children, one a US citizen and one not, I doubt the parents would want to split them up.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-06T18:32:43,0
This president isn't even sure if he is supposed to uphold the Constitution or not. Our top priority now should be to bind him with lawsuits as much as we can and make sure the Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2026.,JoeGRC,2025-05-07T13:17:32,1
"Agreed, when he or people who work for him break the law, then they need to be sued which is far more effective solution than protesting his actions. He needs to be buried in lawsuits. Hopefully the Democrats do take both houses but for that to happen it would be helpful if the progressives refrained from attacking Democrats and the idiots who voted for Jill Stein should admit their error and resolve to be team players in 2026.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-07T14:14:08,1
