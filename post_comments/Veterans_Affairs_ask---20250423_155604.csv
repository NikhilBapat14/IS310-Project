It shouldn't be too difficult. Almost every Christian I've met is very anti-Christian.,snarquisnarquer,2025-04-23T16:18:47,15
"Can confirm, and the email listed such broad areas where discrimination can be claimed that pretty much anyone that ever was displeased with anything at work can file a complaint and basically would turn the work environment into the Wild West",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-23T15:59:45,10
No one should email that task force with less than truthful information. No one at all. Don't do it. Do not email  Anti-ChristianBiasReporting@va.gov.,cakesandpiescnp,2025-04-23T15:59:06,10

I wonder what would happen if the employees started launching complaints that most of the actions of the administration are anti-Christian or at least antithetical to Christian beliefs.,Winterwasp_67,2025-04-23T17:15:54,3
"""Anti-Christian bias"" I fuckin swear...Ten years in the USAF and I never once saw a chaplain cover anything other than Christianity. Every all call when a chaplain was present it was always a Christian one. Anytime I saw leadership bring religion up in an all call, again always Christian.   I never once saw the same level of respect for any other religion that Christianity gets. At most I saw a person or two get a religious waiver to wear something not included in regs (yamaka, turban). Hell I remember my MTI asking me if I was gonna go sacrifice a goat to get better at PT just for going to the wicca service.   If anything Christianity gets preferential treatment compared to any other religion. They can shove it where the sun don't shine.",CarolinaBat,2025-04-23T17:22:47,3
Isn't this dei but just for Christians? Minus the DE part I guess,dropkickninja,2025-04-23T16:01:11,3

I remember another government that demanded people inform on their neighbors with beliefs they didn’t like…,-ItsCasual-,2025-04-23T17:46:42,2
"Um... Haven't we *always* not allowed religious discrimination? The list they put out is shit that nobody does (or should do) anyway because it's been illegal since always. Like the first amendment and the civil rights act already went over this.   The sound of it is awful, but it doesn't seem to be anything new.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-23T18:04:48,2
JD killing the pope seems pretty anti-Christian to me. Maybe we should report him.,BilaSamahani,2025-04-24T02:36:54,2

"I mean… there are so many different flavors of Christianity. I’m morbidly curious to see how it will play out.   “My boss didn’t give me a promotion because I’m Christian”   HR “Your boss is Lutheran and so are you.”  “He belongs to ECLA and they are not true Christians as they are too liberal. I’m Missouri Synod, we are the only acceptable Lutheran! At least he isn’t a Catholic I suppose… those pope worshippers. Don’t get me started on Mormons!”  HR: “well I’m Mormon and you insulted me. We are the only true Christians in this world...”",The_muffinfluffin,2025-04-23T18:59:53,3
That would be so horrible. Don't mention it to the kinksters of Fetlife because it would be terrible if someone sent off pervy pastor porno scripts or their favorite steamy religious smut. That would be such a shame indeed.,krichcomix,2025-04-23T17:53:23,2
One could just mass email about the administration's attacks on the DC Bishop.,bootlegvader,2025-04-23T19:29:33,2
