Sadly this time we don’t have Mister Roger’s to kindly explain that PBS has fundamentally helped children learn essential lessons while being wholesome programming for American youth. My son learned to be kind while watching Daniel Tiger among the other programming on the network. Also NPR is dope as hell and has some great shows with excellent viewpoints.  We should be giving these organizations more and what they do should be classified as a government service but sadly Trump is even trying to defund things that are as essential like the USPS.",Healthy_Jackfruit_88,2025-05-03T01:41:53,3

"Actually this started in the first W administration. His GOP Congress passed a law saying stations could not raise money for, or purposefully save for, regular and routine big equipment purchases. This would have killed all the smaller stations in less than a decade. They claimed they were saving taxpayer dollars from being corruptly swindled by these fatcat rural public radio stations.     Joan Kroc, the McDonalds founder’s widow, left $200 million to the NPR Foundation, thus saving NPR as we know it.
