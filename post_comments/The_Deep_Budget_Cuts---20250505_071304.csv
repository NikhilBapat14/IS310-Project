"Trump: My beautiful birthday/military parade will only cost around $92 million. That's peanuts compared to it's value.  Also Trump: We need to cut $163 billion from the federal budget to reduce frivolous spending on education, housing and medical research.",Troll_in_the_Knoll,2025-05-05T08:08:30,6

"From Bloomberg News reporters [Jennah Haque](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AVRj1cfGRXo/jennah-haque), [Mathieu Benhamou](https://bloomberg.com/authors/ARGvU-NX7Bw/mathieu-benhamou), and [Dave Merrill](https://bloomberg.com/authors/AQOpt3X7mIQ/dave-merrill):  President Donald Trump envisioned a drastic remaking of the US government in [his budget request](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/trump-budget-seeks-23-domestic-spending-cut-13-defense-hike), dramatically curtailing domestic agencies, while boosting the [military and border protection](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/trump-to-propose-record-1-01-trillion-national-security-budget).  The White House’s fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget would cut discretionary spending by more than a quarter in five cabinet departments, while increasing the Department of Homeland Security’s budget by nearly 65%.  The proposed budget — which rarely becomes reality — effectively serves as a vision board for what Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could do if they had free reign to slash federal spending. Even though DOGE won’t be able to unilaterally make many – if not most – of the cuts described in the so-called skinny budget, the proposal gives clues to how the government could shift during Trump’s remaining years as president. ",bloomberg,2025-05-05T07:13:53,1
