"Whoa - did someone give them a rewrite?  Trump's dumb weakness: he is acting like it's the 1930s when it was impossible to get an instant reaction to being a moron. Part of the old-school authoritarian playbook is the ability to control information. But the Internet called and said, ""Fuck you, imbecile"".",Tony2030,2025-04-30T06:33:11,27

The Chinese will have no problem strangling the US at the expense of their own economy. They are proud and resilient people who think in terms of long term strategy hundreds of years beyond their own lives. They think of the Chinese mission.  Trump is playing with fire here and he will never win this battle.,AwkwardBet7634,2025-04-30T07:30:06,12

"China isn't capitulating because they have all of the cards. They have the cash reserves to outlast us. They are making deals with the rest of the world, while the united states is becoming increasingly isolated. They are making deals to make up for the lost trade. Most importantly, they do not have elected officials who are answerable to angry voters. China knows that all they have to do is wait us out.",Paragon910,2025-04-30T08:08:43,5
"China has an authoritarian government. They don't have to kneel down... Their population is conditioned to being uncomfortable due to government policy and decisions, AND they DO NOT rely on us nearly as much as we do them. You can't say neither of those two things about the US.  Half of us didn't even want a trade war, then about half of the other half, aren't even sure why we're doing it, then we'll see what the last quarter thinks a week after prices start going up. The US population will blink first, WAY first!  He broke the oldest rule they teach at Westpoint, you don't get into a fight you CAN'T win!",No-Group-4504,2025-04-30T07:12:56,15
"Why should it? This trade war was over before it began. China will not bow to pressure from the US or internally. Exports to the USA comprise only 3% GDP . It is now using this debacle as an opportunity to open up new markets and displace the US.   It has already cancelled beef and LNG contracts. Cancellations will continue and this business will flow to nations with weaker currencies and closer proximity. China's imports will become cheaper and this business will never return to the US.  Trump is weakening the USA to the point of economic recession, or worse. With a weakening USD and retreating bond market it is in deep trouble.  China has the US by the balls and can choose to dump its considerable bond holdings. This and its ability to inflict a rare earth shock hangs like the sword of Damocles over Trump's head.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-30T06:37:18,10
">“China won’t back down so the voices of the weak will be heard, bullying will be stopped and justice will not disappear from the world.”  Dam.  DIdn't need any excuse.  We know the diapered Bully's tactics, and how eager he is to bring suffering on Americans - and everyone else - to soothe his own ego.  BUT now everyone in the world realizes the USA is NOT governed by Rule of Law.  America does not keep her word - even to law-abiding American citizens.  That's enough of an indictment to doom us to Int'l bottom-dwelling long after we get rid Trump.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-30T06:30:12,8
"China's economy is growing at 4% as it steadily decouples from, and works to isolate, the US. America's economy is shrinking at 0.3%. I don't think Republicans understand how leverage or card games work.",mkt853,2025-04-30T09:29:12,4

"China has built more high speed rail for its citizens in 10 years than the US did in the 20th century.  They are an authoritarian country, but they are also expanding their infrastructure, investing in energy and using soft power to a much greater extend.  The US and Europe are bogged down by regulations and self interests. Nothing gets done. Progress is so slow. Everything has hurdles.  I believe in democracy, and I want to live in a free society but it looks like that China is on the verge of being the new world power.",Extension_Fun_3651,2025-04-30T07:41:35,2

"Yes. And it's completely alienating America from people who used to feel like they were the USA's allies (but thanks to Trump, don't anymore).    The rest of the world's mission to foster an economy that navigates America has never been so pressing. The prestige of the American dollar as a global currency was built on the nations dependability. But America is no longer a dependable partner (with a ""friend"" like this, who needs enemies?).   I'm from the UK and 1000s of our troops died fighting in Americas wars in Iraq & Afghanistan. And what for? It's not only that those wars were absolute disasters, but we can't even say we made those sacrifices for a worthwhile ally.    Why should we ever come to America's aid ever again?  The attitude now will rapidly become ""If you want to set countries on fire, then you can fight those fires alone."". ",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T07:32:05,22

"I'm pretty sure the Trump regime is on the cusp of becoming an authoritarian government. So this won't even be a battle between a democracy and an authoritarian government, but between a new authoritarian regime flexing it's power against an old one.    Trumps already stated he wants to serve for a 3rd term. And I don't think this is a suggestion; this is a statement about what will happen, whether people like it or not. ",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T07:34:50,9
"You have clearly never visited China or had meaningful conversations with Chinese people. Yes the government does control many aspects of Chinese lives, but they are not conditioned to being uncomfortable. The standard of living and quality of life has improved drastically over the last several decades. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure, education, economic development, and jobs while the US has been bogged down in culture wars and bipartisan hostility. VPN’s are common in China and the citizens have access to the same information as the rest of the world. They are far from perfect, but most Chinese citizens see the government as improving their lives and putting them on a par with the US.  They aren’t going to accept being dictated to.",Reddituser45005,2025-04-30T08:13:41,8

"I agree with most of what you said there. What I don't agree with is the level of tolerance the Chinese have for their government v. the American level. I didn't say they don't have a positive view of their government. My Chinese friend does. I said they will tolerate a lot more from their government than we will ours. Their country is run by communists... They know there is very little they can do to change policy once the government makes a decision. It's getting bad in the US, but the public can still effectively pressure congress.  I don't think they mind the fight... I'm sure their attitude is a lot like the Canadians. We basically, unprovokedly, attacked them with a trade war. I think the reaction to want to fight back is human nature... They have a reason to want to fight, and we don't. We have half a country that went into the fight wondering why the fuck we're doing this, with more than half against it.   They're not going to be protesting their government the way we are going to when those prices skyrocket. They probably won't protest at all. What's there to protest. They were attacked with a trade war, and they're responding.",No-Group-4504,2025-04-30T19:49:49,1
