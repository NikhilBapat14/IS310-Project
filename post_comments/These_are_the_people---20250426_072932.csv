"The irony in being told no one is above the law by celebrities and politicians who are by far some of the most corrupt people in our society that are, in fact, above the law as we have seen on many occasions is genuinely laughable.",tylerray1997,2025-04-26T08:09:19,753

Joe Biden certainly was above the law. 100% guilty of having classified documents and nothing happened. Hunter Biden 100% guilty of having classified documents on his laptop and nothing happened. No one is above the law unless you are a democrat.,AdagioVast,2025-04-26T08:06:52,109

"What they mean is: “no republican or libertarian can do anything that a democrat doesn’t want them to do, irrespective of whether there is an actual law that prohibits it”.  The corollary is that “democrats can ignore any actual law without penalty if doing so furthers their present political positions”.  (Or something like that.

It’s because they don’t like the law that’s being upheld. If they can’t abolish a law they prefer the system just ignore it and reward anyone who violates it.,Impressive-Control83,2025-04-26T08:02:00,0

"I kind of think the DOJ, Trump etc expected the left to act like this and completely throw it out of context. I mean unless you have full on TDS, you know that this judge was not arrested because she opposed Trump’s views. She was arrested because she broke a law. It doesn’t take a law degree to know that if you obstructing law enforcement is a crime!

"I predict that one of the great advances that will come out of the A.I. revolution will be the near complete decimation of Hollywood.   Once A.I. progresses far enough, there won't be any need for actors or sets.  Companies will be able to create entire movies or episodic show series that are 100% digital and will be nearly indistinguishable from those currently being produced.  At that point, there will be little need for Hollywood and its overwhelming number of overpaid, overpampered, overindulged ""elites"".
