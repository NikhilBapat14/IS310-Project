Maher is a moron. Imagine missing all of the satire and irony and just blindly bringing up the Holocaust... To a Jewish person. ,evilinsane,2025-04-25T01:07:26,1
"This is tragically desperate stuff from Bill Maher.  For a comedian who pokes fun at other people, Maher seems to have no sense of humour when he's the butt of the joke. Where was this righteous indignation when he was dining with Trump?  For the record, Larry David knows better than almost anyone where the line is re satirising Hitler. Maher is just butthurt that Larry David called him out as an appeasing fool for his soiree with Trump.",bin10pac,2025-04-25T01:08:38,1

"I was the biggest Bill Maher fan, and I remember when he gave $1 million to the Obama campaign, but I’m so glad I stopped listening to him years ago. Clownish.",johnfromberkeley,2025-04-25T01:10:49,1

Imagine being Bill Maher and thinking you have the street cred to fire shots at fucking Larry David.  There's really nothing else to be said.,gradientz,2025-04-25T01:18:34,1
