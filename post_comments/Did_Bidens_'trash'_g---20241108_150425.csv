Not really. The election is gonna get analyzed to death but the simplest explanation is that the republicans came out to vote and the democrats didn’t. The turnout was horribly low for such an important election.,Siny_AML,2024-11-08T16:02:56,12
"They can analyze this and to death, and they will.  The answer is simple.  Democrats didn't vote.  Everything else is a circle jerk.  Elections have consequences. Those who don't show up to vote are actually voting for the other side.",ohjoyousones,2024-11-08T16:45:14,3

"I doubt it. The factors causing the Republicans' win had been accumulating for a long time, that last minute gaffe didn't have an impact at all.   So yeah it was not the reason Democrats lost the election. Just like how Trump's comedian at MSG rally didn't really have an impact on the Latino vote like Democrats assumed.",jxdlv,2024-11-08T19:31:00,2
"In general, we don't really have the tools to measure this with certainty. We don't have a measure that can isolate that comment and no other variables, so no matter what we're mostly going to be extrapolating from more general data and that _could_ result in error.   But I think most quality analysts would say the answer is no, and I think that's right. It seems the biggest issue for the Dems was huge anti-incumbency feeling, some of which was atmospheric--all the major western democracies that had elections this year saw major issues for the incumbent party--and some of which was perceived policy, especially around immigration and the economy.   Oddly enough, issues like the Dems being too liberal or having said the wrong things didn't resonate negatively with voters very much.",mormagils,2024-11-08T16:33:48,1
Incumbents all around the world have lost recent elections due to inflation.  The most important issue according to exit polls was inflation.   People wanted a different party in charge in hopes of staving inflation. It's that simple.,TylerJWhit,2024-11-08T19:58:52,1
"I don't know how it affected the numbers but at the polling place where i live, a deep red county in a very red bible belt state, people were wearing trash bags over their shirts.  So it had some impact but i don't know if that actually influenced their decision to vote or not",ILoveMaiV,2024-11-09T10:56:37,1

Rando roast comedian with a small connection to the campaign makes a joke related to an ongoing issue in the territory.  MASSIVE COVERAGE.  OMG the horror!

> The turnout was horribly low for such an important election.  Sort of. Turnout in the swing states was actually high on both sides--record-setting in most cases. It was in the safely blue/non-competitive states where Democratic turnout collapsed.  Harris actually did better than Biden did in most of the swing states. Trump just also did better there than he did in 2020.,anneoftheisland,2024-11-08T16:57:20,3

"This.  A lot of preliminary analysis is painting this as a 2008/1992 election, where the party in power was going to get punished for the economy as that was the #1 issue on everyone's minds.  The fact that a few blue states with Democratic control were having their own massive problems (New York notably) didn't help either.  I think the further and further away from the election, people are going to conclude that democrats were in a near impossible situation to win. The reason why the Biden debate debacle happened in the first place was because it was already looking dire back then, and they wanted an early debate to see if that can stop the tide.",Naliamegod,2024-11-11T04:39:03,1

"What other laws can we ignore? I dunno let’s start with the list of laws Trump ignores (before office, in office, and ongoing). It’s a long list",Specific_Hornet,2024-11-09T10:57:21,1
"You are misinterpreting what the commenter said. Obviously, Biden did better than Kamala in terms of vote percentage share (since he won pluralities or majorities in the swing states, and Kamal did not). However, Kamala got more RAW VOTES than Biden in many swing states: e.g. more total people voted for her than Biden 2020.   Unfortunately, Trump also accomplished the same feat - more people voted for him in the swing states than he netted in 2020, and he found more new support than she did.   So basically, swing state turnout rose for both sides but Trump outpaced her.",Daltire,2024-11-10T14:09:52,1
"Even if she had a year, would her campaign connect or would she make more fumbles?   What was showing off her Cheney endorsement for? It just looked like she was gonna invade Afghanistan. It didn't winky face or  convince enough Republicans, Donald got 94% of the Republican vote, more than 2020.   Saying I'll put a Republican on my cabinet does nothing for nobody. The left thinks you're repugnant for tolerating and offering view and the right thinks you're dumb because why settle for a single cabinet seat when the whole presidency can be had?   Harris didn't want to win with the left. She wanted to lose with the right.",antsam9,2024-11-10T14:24:17,1

So are you for or against following laws or what lol,Specific_Hornet,2024-11-09T16:20:45,1
"First of all, California is still counting.  Secondly, the explanation is quite simple. In swing states like the Blue Wall and the Sun Belt, the Harris campaign invested **heavily** in to driving up voter turnout. They knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors and spent millions of dollars in ads that riled up the fears of their base about Trump (attacks on democracy, attacks on abortion, etc). This was generally effective, and that together with similar successes by Trump's ads/turnout operations are why voter turnout rose in swing states.  By contrast, in blue states and deep red states, there was no such investment. Young people were disillusioned by Harris's stance on the war in Gaza and generally saw her as insincere. Knowing their vote made little difference, they did not show up. In large blue state cities, for every Latino or Black voter who Trump won over, three more simply decided not to even bother showing up.  The cumulative impact is a nationwide shift to the right, decreased overall voter turnout, but a roughly very similar margin of victory in the swing states to what Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Trump netted about the same amount of voters he did in record turnout 2020 by losing some suburban women and moderates, but swapping those lost votes out for new working class latinos, young 18-29 year old men, and white women without college degrees.",Daltire,2024-11-10T20:34:34,1
"S.65 - never even got one vote it died in the house after Elizabeth Warren try to introduce it.    So u can’t violate a law that’s not a law.   But again even if it was a law, you still have not supplied any specifics on how Trump violated it.  It’s like me citing a theft law and in the same  sentence insisting u violated it just on my say so.   Trump did divest from his businesses when he became president the first time and let his family run them. He never took a presidential salary that he was entitled to while being president and he was the only president in modern times whose net worth declined after leaving office.   If the Warren’s bill passed, Biden would have been more in violation of that law for not disclosing all of the corrupt money he and his family took from many foreign countries over the years but I bet you are willfully blind to those facts.",Psychological-Ball77,2024-11-09T20:45:58,1
"I’m for enforcing our laws as legislatively passed and signed by the executive. If that means deporting a lot of people, so be it.  I hate this selective prosecution/enforcement.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-09T16:28:33,1
I guess the fake lying fears about Trump that Harris tried to convince her base of fell on deaf ears because even most of those people saw through her fakery - Trump was president before and none of what she and the MSM fake news said was going to happen in 2024 happened in 2016/2017   America and now most of its people are waking up to the nefarious actions of the Democratic Party Bullshit - in Michelle Obama words - for the the first time I am so proud of my country that finally the democrats are waking up to the lies they have been fed by the democrats for so very long and may the next 4 years of true success and common sense be the catalyst that wakes up our remaining countrymen so much so that the Marxist Democrats are powerless for many years to come.,Psychological-Ball77,2024-11-11T10:09:09,1
Ok but what about the convicted felon who is president elect? Should he follow laws? Seems you’re being selective,Specific_Hornet,2024-11-09T16:37:48,1
He has been convicted and should serve whatever sentence he’s given. But he also has the right to appeal that conviction. Which I’m 99% sure he will since *everyone* does that.   Unfortunately there is no restriction on a convicted felon running or being elected President. I do hope he has to try and run the country from prison.
