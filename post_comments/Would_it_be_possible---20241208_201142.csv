"Most likely, nuclear weapons wouldn't be used, and it'd just stay a mostly conventional wars, and that's if it even comes to an actual full-scale conflict, the economic repercussions of starting a war and/or using nuclear weapons/WMDs would basically turn the whole world against whoever used them first.

"Honestly, it really would, whichever country first used *any* nuclear weapons would get sanctioned into oblivion, even by countries who are generally reluctant to emplacement sanctions (with the exception of Iran/ North Korea).",Lopsided_Republic888,2024-12-09T23:41:04,1
"There is only one country that has ever used a nuclear weapons in human history.   When you have that deterrence in your arsenal, however, it gives everyone pause. ",CTCELTICSFAN,2024-12-12T19:40:51,1
"That's correct, only the US has used nuclear weapons, and by comparison those were firecrackers compared to today's nuclear weapons.  What I was trying to communicate was that regardless of *who* used nuclear weapons first in a conflict between the US and Russia or China they'd get sanctioned because no one has ever used nuclear weapons since the atomic bombs. Keep in mind that modern missiles have around 8-10 nuclear submunitions each, so 8-10 bombs that are about 5x more powerful than ""Fat Man"" the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.",Lopsided_Republic888,2024-12-12T21:53:27,1
