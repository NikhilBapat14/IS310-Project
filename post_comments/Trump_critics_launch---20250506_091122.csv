"A new organization of high level political PR people, funded by unnamed rich people. Okay. What's needed is a mass movement of people willing to embrace nonviolent civil disobedience against his illegal power grab.",Building_a_life,2025-05-06T09:26:10,17
"They need to start an impeachment movement over inflation    Unfortunately people just don't care as mucn about tampering in foreign elections or whatever else they tried to get on Trump last time. His popularity went up after all of Schiff's grandstanding.   Americans do care very very very much about prices. Given impeachment will never actually work, it is only a tool to draw attention to an issue    And there is no issue worse for Trump than the high prices. ",ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-06T10:58:01,3

Realistically we will need both. You've got a country that has largely given up on the democratic system. We all know it is corrupt and in need of some breaking. That's how Trump is able to get away with it.    Now of course on certain issues like Musk yeah. He's very toxic. I'd love to see an investigation into him killing USAID that gets into Musk aiding Russian troops with starlink. Something USAID was investigating    But even that is somewhat of a gamble. We know for Americans the top issue isn't Ukraine. Its prices. Prices. Prices. Prices.    The focus the next 4 years should predominantly be on Prices. We can certainly bring up so much else. But the focus must be on prices,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-06T11:03:31,4
> And there is no issue worse for Trump than the high prices.   He's successfully convinced his supporters that it's Biden's fault for the high prices.  And they will hold to that for the next 3.5 years regardless how bad it gets,ERedfieldh,2025-05-06T12:26:57,3
How anyone thought someone who bankrupted a casino would be good for prices is dumbfounding.,Null_Simplex,2025-05-06T12:08:30,1
I don't believe that's true. We saw under Bush that the Republican party can be swept. I think the economic conditions have to be there and they just weren't Trump's 1st term. People loved the stimulus checks and everything else. ,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-06T13:31:38,1
