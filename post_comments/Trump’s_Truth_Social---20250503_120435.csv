"He’s obviously being propped up from behind the scenes.  Anytime they let him loose he rants incoherently and repeats the same tired old lies that are permanently embedded in his brain.  When he signs his executive orders they have to explain to him what he’s signing, and he nods like it’s the first time he’s ever heard of it.  He knows he’s losing his faculties but employs the same tactics everyone else with dementia does to cover it up.",Desperate-Ostrich707,2025-05-03T12:11:07,36
Are his Truth Social posts more of an alarm bell for his mental state than his speeches or his interviews or his cabinet meetings or his oval office meetings?  Is there anything we see from him that isn't raising alarm bells?,specqq,2025-05-03T12:14:54,18
He's a dullard at his base level but now he's slipping into cognitive decline. It shows in his social media posts (that he  dictates to an aide to upload for him) and just seeing him lumber about and listening to him give speeches and interviews. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-03T12:10:31,19
"Jesus fucking Christ.   Donald Trump has never made sense. During his first campaign in 2015 he never made sense. He hasn't made sense the whole fucking time.  A combination of slow-rolling dementia and an extremely stupid man who has never lived a single day in the real world, insulated by enormous privilege, constant media attention and endless inherited wealth.  This isn't news, and the media's sanewashing has been the primary driving force empowering him to begin with.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-03T13:10:16,15

"Past the early stages. People called it out months ago- emotional regulation was getting somehow worse, occasionally forgetful, losing coherence. He reacted heavily to whatever the last person he talked to seemed to believe.  His short term memory seems pretty gone. He is constantly contradicting himself, likely because he cannot remember what he just said. He's holding onto large emotional events, but forgetting details. He's having trouble putting words together and, quite frankly, saying things even he previously knew he shouldn't be saying. Lot of little slips.",whichwitch9,2025-05-03T13:51:53,25

"Even Elon Musk’s AI agreed with you:  The article’s description of a malignant narcissist aligns closely with Donald Trump’s behavior based on his public persona and widely observed actions. Let’s break it down by comparing the traits and behavioral expectations outlined in the article to what we’ve seen from Trump.  Core Traits  	•	Grandiosity: The article highlights an inflated sense of self-importance. Trump frequently touts his intelligence, success, and achievements—calling himself a “stable genius” or claiming he’s the best at everything from business to governing. This self-aggrandizement fits the trait perfectly.  	•	Lack of Empathy: Defined as an inability to care about others’ feelings, this is evident in Trump’s rhetoric and policies. Critics often cite his immigration policies, like family separations at the border, or his dismissive comments about opponents and marginalized groups as showing little regard for others’ suffering.  	•	Exploitation: The article describes using others for personal gain. Trump’s business dealings—such as lawsuits alleging he stiffed contractors—and his political maneuvers, like leveraging allies for loyalty while discarding them when they’re no longer useful, suggest exploitative tendencies.  	•	Aggression and Sadism: This involves cruel or demeaning behavior, sometimes enjoying others’ pain. Trump’s aggressive Twitter attacks, mocking nicknames (e.g., “Crooked Hillary”), and rally rhetoric often degrade others, with a tone that seems to relish the takedown.  	•	Paranoia: Suspicion and mistrust define this trait. Trump’s repeated claims of “rigged elections,” “witch hunts” (e.g., the Mueller investigation), and a “deep state” conspiracy against him reflect a paranoid worldview.  Behavioral Expectations  	•	Manipulative and Deceitful Behavior:  Trump has faced accusations of distorting facts—like his claims about crowd sizes or election fraud—to shape narratives in his favor, pointing to a manipulative streak.  	•	Violating Others’ Rights Without Remorse: His response to the January 6th Capitol riot, where he initially praised supporters despite the violence, and his relentless targeting of critics, suggest a disregard for others’ rights with little apparent regret.  	•	Rage or Contempt When Challenged: Trump’s fiery retorts to criticism—whether lashing out at journalists, judges, or even fellow Republicans—show a pattern of rage and disdain when his authority is questioned.  	•	Superficial Charm: His ability to captivate crowds and rally his base with charisma is notable, yet it often feels performative, masking a harsher underlying demeanor toward those outside his circle.  	•	Lack of Genuine Relationships: Many of Trump’s alliances, from political aides to family, appear transactional—built on what they can do for him rather than mutual loyalty or affection.",bearever,2025-05-04T22:58:05,2
