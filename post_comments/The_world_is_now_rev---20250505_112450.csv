"a few days ago the German government officially categorized the AfD as a proven right-wing extremist organization <3  **eta clarification** bc this is being asked a lot:  no, this doesn’t mean the AfD is banned from running. but it’s important progress in that direction.  for now, it basically means that it opens more opportunities to cut it off from state financing (like the NPD/Die Heimat) or outlaw it altogether. so we aren’t done & ofc we have to address the root of the issues leading to extremism, but we gotta take what hope we can get rn.  there are also various petitions to ban the AfD. on the off chance someone in Germany hasn’t already seen & signed, here are the top ones I know of:  - https://innn.it/afdverbot >1m signatures - https://aktion.campact.de/rechtsextremismus/afd-verbot-pruefen/teilnehmen >250k signatures",baes__theorem,2025-05-05T11:32:24,5358

"America isn't likely to get out of this unscathed, but in a way, the world may end up in a better place because of Trump.   We were headed down a very bleak path on the global stage. Things are still perilous, but democracy is having a pretty big moment.   If Trump had been a competent authoritarian, he could have easily used America's bully pulpit to plunge the world into an era of dictatorships the likes of which we had not seen in the modern era. He could have united the right across the nations of the Earth, and built a truly horrifying and lasting regime of terror.   But instead, he is so profoundly incompetent, so utterly and totally incapable, that he will not be able to rise to his current moment and consolidate power. He will isolate himself and America, and in doing so he will catalyze other nations to end dependency on America for security and trade, and find other partners who share their values.  he is awakening the people of the world to the terrors of being ruled by incompetent, greedy fools placed into power by the worst 1/3rd of the population.  America is triple-fucked, but Canada, Australia, Germany, and other democracies may actually heed this wake-up call to reject their own domestic fascists and install new and more robust protections on Democracy.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-05T11:45:21,1198
"It's almost insult to injury to watch these other countries come to their senses instead of barreling down a path of nationalism, untethered capitalism, and hatred. I'm very relieved for these places but it's disturbing that the USA can't see the forest for the trees. Unfortunately, in the USA's case, this current situation has been engineered over decades and is supported and empowered by complicit media organizations that have been purchased exactly for this purpose by twisted oligarchs, and citizens united has transformed D.C. into a spectacle of pure, unabashed corruption as dark money is now effectively used to influence elections and voters. The result? Many Americans are now parroting and spreading anti-democratic and anti-American rhetoric under the guise of ""patriotism"".

"See Richard Quest's reaction to Trump advisers' tariff remarks   https://youtu.be/ajepCm-mYUE?t=79     China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

It will accept airmail parcels until Apr. 27.  >“For sending items to the US, the public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the U.S.’s unreasonable and bullying acts,” the government wrote.

Then their families came under attack.](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/these-judges-ruled-against-trump-then-their-families-came-under-attack-2025-05-02/)  The president’s supporters unleashed a wave of threats and menacing posts. And they didn’t just target the judge. Some attacked Boasberg’s brother. Others blasted his daughter. Some demanded the family’s arrest – or execution.  U.S. District Judge John McConnell’s family endured similar threats after he ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in freezing grants for education and other services. Far-right provocateur Laura Loomer tweeted a photo of the judge’s daughter, who had worked at the U.S. Education Department as a policy advisor, and accused McConnell of protecting her paycheck.   Billionaire Elon Musk amplified the post to his 219 million X followers. Neither mentioned the daughter had left her job before Trump’s inauguration.  Loomer continued her attacks with nine more posts in the ensuing days – and more than 600 calls and emails flooded McConnell’s Rhode Island courthouse, including death threats and menacing messages taunting his family, according to a court clerk and another person familiar with the communications.  Boasberg and McConnell are among at least 11 federal judges whose families have faced threats of violence or harassment after they ruled against the new Trump administration, a Reuters investigation found.  **Threats against judges and their families “are ultimately threats to constitutional government.

The massive leaps in technology over the past few years mean that Trump is able to create a violent totalitarian dictatorship worse than even Orwell could have predicted. It’s not wholly 1984, it’s not wholly Nazism, but it is far too close to those two than it ever should have been, I can tell you that it’s wholly pure evil incarnate, and there is not a single redeeming quality about it. They have duped the middle class, they have duped the working class, and the only thing they now how to do is rip as much of your money out of the country as possible before climate change turns the whole world to shit.     When you see these little witty articles from the liberal press about how MAGA Christians have turned on family values, how the MAGA working class have turned on the fight for equality and justice, how MAGA veterans have turned on their vow never to wish war upon their descendants, how MAGA gun owners have turned on their 2nd Amendment rights , how MAGA neocons have turned on their vow to keep the world free etc. - if you really believe you are better, you need to take up the mantle and act now. Do it for VML, for all of the others wounded by the Trump admin - hell, do it for me, I’m disabled and if RFK Jr. gets a hand on the UK’s cards I’m getting sent to a hard labour camp. Most importantly of all, do it for yourselves. And do it for the whole human race, because when there is a dictatorship in America, there’s no turning back for anyone in the world.

"It's hard to imagine 2 years of this before even having Congress push back.  There's not really any hope.

"Why do democratic governance systems attract sociopaths?  To me this is the question of our time. It's about choosing to center good, prosocial values and behaviors, to value minimization or harm (""ahimsa"") rather than hatred.   I'm not saying hatred doesn't exist and we should ignore it. I'm saying we know that groups move in the direction of the goals they set: their values and missions. This is true of companies, families, municipalities, every possible grouping of people.  Therefore we will never get to peace and prosperity without removing hate, war, greed, etc as guiding elements in our collective systems.",thornyRabbt,2025-05-06T04:31:01,2

"We're really not.   It's still fracturing. In Canada, the only things I can see that will make sure we don't go back on this pathway America is attempting to blaze for the world would be comprehensive and difficult to pull off. I don't know if it's even possible - and it's certainly impossible for it to be fully reversed in any sort of timeline that sees ""normal"" as most folks remember it return.   Here's some big picture issues: * Strict internet, data, and marketing regulations and control - a cultural and internet content firewall similar in scope and nature to China's. * Heavy and unavoidable criminalisation of financial, crypto, marketing, and data crimes committed by corporations. Jail time mandatory (gen pop, no fancy prisons, no house arrest), mandatory counselling for life, blind trusts, and criminal records for relevant staff STARTING at the senior leader and board member levels. * Ban corporate money and lobbyists from Canada. Period. All political donations in a central fund, distributed to all parties. Heavy limits on 3rd party paid ads. * Vote reform - proportional ranked. Fairvote.ca. * Overhaul of education, including digital and internet safety, and identifying misinformation. More house hippo-style ads on all internet platforms.  * Additional civics and political structure courses in late high school. Apartisan (funded by all parties, run by apartisan body) political refresher courses offered year round and especially during election run ups.  * Psychological and mental health care must be incorporated aggressively into Canadian universal health care. So many of the alt right issues stem from unmanaged mental health problems that people aren't identifying or treating. Fear to the degree AB Separatists feel? As someone diagnosed with and medicated for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I see a lot of common symptoms.    And none of this addresses the *actual real issue*: our planet is being killed by unfettered capitalism. In no world are we going to stave off life threatening climate change. The only reason Canada may be well-positioned to weather this is because we'll be right next to newly opened arctic trading lanes. But we still won't avoid the impacts of fires, climate refugeeism, increasing extreme weather, and more.   We might ""stabilize"" or find some equilibrium.    But increasingly this feels like obtaining palliative care. ",smokyggrowls,2025-05-05T14:48:07,2

"He was talking to a bunch of people the other day about how he’s looking at getting rid of income tax. His justification was that back in the day the US made a ton of money from tariffs and the issued a great tariff commission of 1887 in which the commission was made in order to figure out what to do with all the money they were making from Tariffs. He never even mentioned anything about income tax other than it was implemented in 1913 but his logic was to basically go back to a time when the US made so much money from tariffs that there was no need for income tax.  EXCEPT THAT if you actually just even did the slightest bit of research you’d find out that first, there was  I great tariff commission of 1887. There was one in 1882 with its findings being that tariffs should be lowered but it was shrugged off. The only thing that happened in 1887 was President Cleveland addressed congress with the wild idea of getting rid of tariffs, which basically he campaigned on that and ended up losing the election, but would be elected again four years later.  Basically the reason income tax was implemented was first during the civil war to help fund the war. After the war was over the tax was withdrawn. But what Trump wants is completely backwards. Basically because of the tariffs which is how the government made most of its money back then, every day essentials became a burden on low and middle class families, yet the rich had no problem paying these prices, and it was seen as unjust. So what they did was they took away tariffs and instead implemented income tax, which would tax you accordingly to how much you made, that way the same high tax that tariffs apply wouldn’t be applied to everyday essentials people need to survive, and instead you place a state tax on it according to where you live etc and then income tax is applied to how much you make.  So Trump could not literally have it more backwards if he actually tried to",northernjaguarprince,2025-05-06T10:40:12,1

"Maybe most countries should consider alternatives between an autocratic government a la Trump and, as an example, the Democrats under Biden. I mean, your $36,000,000,000,000 (36,000 trillion...) is no coincidence and no, this game of simply adding a few zeros doesn't work in the long run. And this duration is about to expire. It's called the compound interest effect. It also applies to debt. As far as I can remember, your interest burden already exceeds your military budget by almost a trillion a year. I haven't mentioned repayment yet, just the pure interest that has to be paid. From all of you to the FED. Please google for yourselves who owns the FED and which banking families it consists of. No, Biden is not to blame for this gigantic amount of debt, but all those who have participated in this system for the last 100 years or so. It is the giral compound interest monetary system, which has an inherent expiration date. When it expires, the culprits are sought. It's the foreigners who take your job, it's the junkies on the streets, it's the asylum seekers, it's the Arabs, the Russians, the Chinese, it was the boomers or it's the old, the disabled and the sick. Guilty groups are identified and it is never the (money) system as such. We all increasingly lack humanity because we are only defined by money. What I'm getting at is that there has to be a system change, or a monetary reset, otherwise (according to Adam Riese) you (and us Europeans with the euro as well) will soon be upside down. It is a pity that the world is not yet ready to pay some kind of tax on every digital money transaction. According to David R. Webb (The great Taking), it would only be a fraction of a percent (for example, 0.1% would correspond to 10 cents on 100 dollars). That would be enough to cover the costs, including free health insurance for everyone! But there are people who don't want that. They would rather let the whole currency go up at some point, i.e. hyperinflation, resulting in a major war. When it's all over, here's your new currency. You need money? Here you go, we can lend you 1000 of these new units at 3%. And so the (monopoly) game starts all over again. However, all 4 stations are already taken before the game begins.  To the bank, of course, because they want to maintain their power. And the whole shitty theater is just so that the richest (financially, inner wealth is not meant /s) and most powerful on this earth can keep their place in the sun. For example: We, the people and citizens of this world, are the 99.9% and the rich and powerful of this world make up 0.1 percent. With approx 8 billion people on earth, that still leaves 8 million rich and powerful people. I could imagine that they could manage quite well without us...

"The problem isn't tunnel vision or a lack of strategic thinking, they've boxed themselves in.  The vast majority of Democrats today are classic liberals, always and forever completely in the pocket of the rich, and thus straight jacketed to the point of impotence whenever dealing with reactionaries who are happy to break all the liberal rules and institutions to pieces. For years the large majority of Democrats kept hoping the centrist Republicans would make a come back, then the two groups could keep their cushy gravy train of government capture and corruption going indefinitely. When the Republicans started taking a drastic turn toward populist rhetoric, while simultaneously endorsing the libertarian fantasies of gutting the entire government, Democrats just kept pointing and saying, ""look, this is entirely incoherent, it's a disaster"". As if the truth of that statement would appease the base they abandoned to offshoring 30 years ago, who have all long since been subsumed by right wing media propaganda owned by the reactionary rich. A demographic who now either believe the magically incoherent thinking, or just grin and say, ""yeah, now you burn with us, you elitist scum.""  There is no both sides here, the Democrats were always the better option for the vast majority of Americans. But they were also always a *terrible* option. Once they let things get bad enough that their own base abandoned them, and they couldn't reliably out-compete Republicans for the plutocrat funding, and their new base in the educated class turned out to be politically feckless, there never was going to be any outcome other than a drastic, enduring drive toward outright authoritarianism.  At this point the only thing that would prevent this would be a couple years of massive political/judicial obstructionism, then a sudden tilt toward Sanders/Cortes. But the liberal media is still stuck in the fantasy of things going back to the way they were, and the right wing media has been poisoning the ground for truly progressive change for years. So, despite the rather large groundswell of popular support in the absence of real funding, the majority of Americans still think that watered down Democratic Socialism is a bridge too far, and would rather roll the dice and hope Trump isn't really serious, or is too incompetent, and they don't wake up tomorrow in the midst of a fascist state.",RedditFostersHate,2025-05-06T00:24:57,1

It's a sense of superiority, and damn anyone who dares speak ill of your country. Nationalism is modern day America, it's Nazi Germany, it *is* something that should be denounced at all costs.

In fact we really don’t realize just how close we were to joining Germany in WW2. The nazi parties ideals were started in the US. Half the books made by the nazi party leaders had direct quotes and or references from US authors and think tanks.   American corporate leaders were truly the reason the Axis Powers didn’t win. Henry Ford and the other big name auto manufacturers and other manufacturers turned their factories into wartime power houses.

Xi didn't show up to his inauguration and hasn't even called him since.    >But the president also told reporters on Air Force One that he has no plans to speak with his Chinese counterpart President Xi, denting hopes for a swift start to formal trade talks between the economic superpowers.  This cold war with China has been going on longer than most people know.  Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences    https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > ***Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls***, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong.

">  He also only won a minority government, so there's good chances Canada will have an other election in ~2 years.  Canadian here, I’d say it’s doubtful we’ll see an election within 2 years.   This last minority made it six months short of the full term. There’s a ton of reasons why (unless the liberals call it because they think they can win a majority) this parliament will last a while.   Carney has 49.3% of the seats. It’s like, the second or third strongest majority in history. He’s 3 short of the magic 172, it’s a tough government to collapse. Compared to, say, Paul Martin in 2004 (a “weak” minority because LPC + NDP /= majority) Carney’s in a much stronger position seat wise.    Plus, the NDP are broke, need to reorganize after their worst defeat ever, elect a new leader and rebuild. They ain’t going to bring down the Govt. any time soon.  The Bloc Québécois have stated they aren’t going to bring down the Govt. until Trump is gone (because as a political issue he unites the rest of Canada with Quebec, weakening the bloc, as seen in this election) and they’re also pretty short on cash as well so a sooner election is bad for them too.   The conservatives can’t bring down the government on their own; Pierre’s definitely going to have to spend some time fighting off a leadership review. He’s less popular than his party (and losing like he did isn’t going to help) and the conservatives hitting a record vote share has more to due with Liberal incumbent fatigue after 10+ years, so he’ll be spending a while recalibrating even he stays on as leader.

":) I agree with everything you said. Just not the way you said it. Let me explain in a simple way what I believe happened to the Democratic Party.   In 1972 the first Presidential election I was allow to vote in this country as an eighteen year old, was  during Nixon's second term. Who was truly a horrible man. My family was old school FDR Democratic. I could not truly believe that American voted Nixon- a Trump like crook - into office for a second term. Of course this led to Ford running the country. Then Carter was elected and we saw where that when which led to Reagan.  Ahhh... the most horrible President in American President in history, who began his career during the [McCarthy](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS858US858&cs=1&sca_esv=6f4cffb8fcc6cffb&sxsrf=AHTn8zqZ3c2TOoyYWDSzvoIr24cZNrXfJg%3A1746544788030&q=McCarthyism&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjFtJ6tko-NAxXnF1kFHUKJF_oQxccNegQIAhAB&mstk=AUtExfBd1SU7s0iiAYorYZMD_c_iUlYOgn_7dkka306J_l4sDRcKeSS1iBtMy4GTxWXYwqFYoMLd9boyouuRpMPlJtHbbkXSkM6S_kC3WPVWLtKr1-4FBxkAC7I7vrCmxCcsa0F_Jz14I9IfB4rwvo7yfQn8RUXvPGyxtOH5LqYtWAs_hw0&csui=3) era, going after his fellow actors in Hollywood. Reagan was supported by J Edgar Hoover who counted him to run for President. Once again we know how that turned out. He created the greatest fake Conspiracy Theory in American history known as Trickle Down Economics. Convincing all Americans the Robber Barons would save America and destroy the Commies. Then of course George W Bush took over.  The Bush family is the same family whose parents were involved in the plot to assassinate FDR back in the thirties, Robber Barons all of them.      Let me take a step back for a minute and remind everyone of something. Both Political Parties in America, the Republicans and the Democrats had three factions within them. Hard Right Conservatives, Middle of the Road Centrist and Left Leaning Conservatives. Each of these factions had to do with economic beliefs, the Robber Barons were always Hard Right Conservatives who believe in the fake policies of Trickle Down Economics that tricked American into believing that conservative were looking out for them, and they won often because they had the most money. Now remember this same system was in play within the Democratic Party. Right leaning Democrats, who were actually economically Conservative Democrats, Liberal Democrats who were middle of the road economically and finally Progressives, FDR Democrats, like myself who believe in progressive taxation of the rich, which Hard Right Conservative Republicans under    Reagan labelled as Socialist or Commies.     After George W Bush, came the golden boy of Democratic politics who truly destroyed the Democratic party. Bill Clinton.  He did this by coining the term 'Neo' or New Liberals, which was different then the old meaning of liberal, as Neoliberals were conservative liberals, which is another way of saying they were left-leaning Republicans who joined the Democrat Party and took it over; who also believe in a watered down version of Capitalism, a type of POP culture economics, which stands for ""Profits Over People"". Clinton was always a Robber Baron Democrat. The woman he married was the same a republican turned democratic, who worked for Barry Goldwater in the sixties who also believe in the POP economic culture of Capitalism that benefits Robber Barons.  The two single things Clinton did to destroy our economy the most, is the repeal of the Glass Stegall Act, (that separated investment and commercial banking) one of FDR's finest laws: and allowing America to become the only country in the world to allow the : Pharmaceutical, Medical, HMO's, the Health Insurance Industries and the Dental, Hearing and Vision companies to advertise.  He did this in 1997, and by 1999 America was facing the largest drug addiction crisis in the world with opioids, allowing the legalizations of drug cartels in the US. Clintons repeal of the Glass-Stegall Act is also what led to the Great Recession in 2008, that almost destroyed the Banking and Wall Street industries in America, leading to the biggest bailout ever given to private companies.  The bad part of all of this is after Obama, the Democrats had the gall to put up the wife of one of the worst Democratic Presidents of the last 80 years, to be the first Female President. This action of course led us to Trump's first term.",americanspirit64,2025-05-06T11:18:06,1

Liberals gained from urban turnout and incumbency, not anti-Trump unity.

Americans were horrified to see their soldiers burning down villages or kids covered in napalm so they protested and public opinion shifted hard against the military and US government.  In the 80s, the military industrial complex teamed up with the corporate media giants to take over the Free Press and control public opinion by controlling the media. As a result, the US has been in 19 wars since 1991 and racked up a $36 trillion debt.  With Bush Jr, the media portrayed him as a dummy on purpose. He invaded Iraq illegally by claiming Saddam had WMDs which was a lie but the media helped sell it anyways. That set off PNAC and the war on terror which has been awesome for the war industry and their rich buddies.  With Trump, the media claims he's a Russian tool which is most likely, not true.

So if you look at the number of people who explicitly voted for the Nazi/Republican party out of *everyone* who was able to vote in their respective election; you have 44,374,085 / 11,737,021 = **26.5%** of all eligible German voters casting their ballot for the Nazis in 1932 versus 260,000,000 / 77,302,580 = **33.6%** of all eligible American voters casting their ballot for the Republicans in 2024.  So, yes, there was comparatively more support for The Republicans/MAGA/Trump in the US in 2024 than there was support for The Nazis/Hitler in Germany in 1932, but not as much as you would think when you look at the absolute vote totals, and certainly nothing close to majority support.  They are absolutely comparable. The proportion of the American population who outright supported fascism in 2024 is roughly comparable to the proportion of the German population who did in 1932. The main difference is the political engagement of each population. Proportionally far more Germans were willing to participate in the democratic process when faced with the threat of the Nazis gaining power than Americans were when faced with the threat of MAGA gaining power.",Drunky_McStumble,2025-05-05T23:26:53,1

While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by 2 German divisions, the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately 200 German divisions. Whenever the Allies open a second front on the Continent, it will be decidedly a secondary front to that of Russia; theirs will continue to be the main effort. Without Russia in the war, the Axis cannot be defeated in Europe, and the position of the United Nations becomes precarious. Similarly, Russia's post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one.

Don't you think there was a reason why progressives like AOC and Bernie were on Biden's side even after the DNC establishment turned against Biden and were trying to push him out of the race? The fact is that Biden made a deal with Bernie early in the 2020 primary and kept his word to Bernie to push a progressive agenda. I think the only place they really publicly parted ways was on Israel, otherwise Bernie's (and AOC's) ire have mostly been directed at the DNC establishment itself.

Instead, the government should be inviting people with the talents we need to come live here - permanently, with viable paths to citizenship - so they can compete for all the same jobs as other permanent residents, without being coerced into taking a lower salary because their employer needs to sponsor them.

"Yes, absolutely - my heart goes out to them. And I know they exist because I have some family in America and out of them, half voted for Trump and half did not. It used to be a very united family but when Trump came along, he split the families identity down the middle.   And my closest relative, a young cousin in her 20s, was mortified about the election result. She is highly intelligent and has been studying law with the hopes of one day becoming a lawyer. She wanted to defend children and the vulnerable in society. And she hoped for a Kamala government. But she is so concerned about the future of America now, that she's actively applying for citizenship to the country where I live (UK).   And I'll absolutely help her; as a country, we need smart, hard-working young people like her. And as a liberal-minded person, she'll fit right in, especially in the city where I live (London). She's also visited numerous European countries in recent years and not long ago said that she had begun to identify more as a European than she does as an American.    Her parents are still in denial. They were vocal Trump supporters before, but have gone quiet lately because I think they're having a hard time rationalizing and supporting everything he does. And the repurcussions of the tariff talks are beginning to worry them. They had my cousin very late into their lives and so whilst my cousin is barely into her mid-20s, they're actually not far off their retirement years. But who can retire in this economy?    And they're really frightened of economic recessions; I remember when the dad, my uncle, lost not only his job but their house during the 2008 recession. My cousin, who was just a little kid at the time, had to change and downgrade schools as the family were forced to move to a new area, they had to sell so much of what they had built up over the decades just to survive. And it took them an incredibly long time (like 10+ years?) to get back to a comfortable standard of living, and even then they still don't live in the luxury they once did (before 2008 they used to live in a REALLY big house).   And yeah, if they u-turn and accept and admit that they were wrong, I'll help them out too. Because to me, they're my family and not just ""collateral damage"" in some big game, like Trump increasingly seems to view so many people in America as they begin to struggle in his tariff wars. But I'm still pissed that they let this happen.    So I can probably sympathize more than most. But entire governments just aren't going to have that level of sympathy & forgiveness, especially when Trump and the American people's actions have cost them so much. Many Europeans don't identify with Americans at all now, having long grown tired of the countries arrogance and war-mongering Etc abroad (which we've always been expected to come to the aid of) and now Trump, his tariffs wars against allies and his bullying of Zelensky Etc are the final straw in all that. ",Creative_Recover,2025-05-05T19:01:56,4

">Bags need plastic  The bag was invented long before plastic was - I'd imagine right after 'cloth' of some sort was discovered it only took a solid grip of all the ""corners"" to invent the bag. And the amount of plastic used on certain domestic food goods is generally not that high if any so I'm less certain we're going to see a steep increase or shortages on food overall as a result when a lot of food is domestically sourced. Canned goods will probably increase in price, though a lot of aluminum is recyclable and if canned good prices outweigh fresh food few people are going to gravitate towards the canned food outside of necessity.   I don't know, I think this is just a bit doomerism and things are going to look bleak enough that we do no need to make them bleaker with a preemptive post-apocalyptic fantasy.  I won't tell you not to fill out your bunker or not to try to mindfully stock up on things just in case, but I also think if everyone goes full panic and buys out shelves and hoards stuff it will just invent scarcity by having suppliers unable to keep up with the panic inflated demands on goods that aren't really affected by the tariffs and worsen the ability for people being able to access goods and resources.",Hi_Jynx,2025-05-05T13:05:14,-2

Honestly, the last election was one of the poorest contests in decades and a lot of the world outside of America was sitting dumbstruck as to how the leadership of the world's greatest superpower boiled down to such a poor choice of candidates.

It’s kind of intimidating trying to park in that city if you’re not used to it. I weighed parking it across the bay where I actually know how to find parking and taking the train. Ended up parking half a mile from the protest and walking.  Then on top of the difficulty of getting there, unless your protest is big enough to be covered by the news then the only people who notice it are those who happen to drive or walk past it.

"I mean, I thought the Constitution was supposed to be really codified shit that couldn't be undone? And yet Trump is making a mockery of numerous things stated in the Constitution.    It seems like you're already rapidly entering an age where people might be deported or have Visas denied over having the ""wrong"" beliefs (i.e. being vocally pro-Palestine on social media), the United States is no longer ""Land of the Free"" but is instead now more a place where patriotism and cults surrounding individual politicians are becoming blurred & confused with the nations more fundamental core values and identity. How long do you think it will be before the government decries that to be anti-Trump, is synonymous with being fundamentally ""Un-American""?    Trump is already arguing to end Birthright Citizenship. And if the government goes ahead with this, people who've lived their whole lives in America and identified as American could suddenly find themselves being potentially treated as unwanted foreigners who have no real right to stay in the country. Trump has already stripped legal status from over 530,000 migrants, so what will stop him from stripping birthright citizenships if he could?    Trump's argument is that too many people are using birthright citizenship to get a foothold in America. But I doubt that if it goes ahead it will be policed like that; instead, I believe denial or stripment of birthright citizenship will be more used to subjugate or rid political opponents of Trump than it will be used to genuinely regulate immigration. There are so many people who owe their citizenship to birthright but are now questioning their Republican allegiance, if you were thinking ahead and looking at what the nation might become, wouldn't you feel increasingly uneasy about expressing anti-Trump opinions on social media? Just in case, u'know, you get on the wrong side of Trump and his ever-escalating list of people he wants to punish or persecute.    Once you start dividing people up like this (i.e. birthright citizen Americans VS ""real"" American citizens), you're already one step closer to devaluing human life, your sense of unity is a country and ending up fighting one another.

I do believe we can overcome, but it's a long, hard road to get there. Unfortunately, time is not on our side, and our list of allies will be extremely thin.   When you lose someone to addiction/abuse cycles there are several stages. In the beginning, you try to help actively, since you believe some outside intervention can make a change. Then you get burned for the first time. Then the next, and the next, and so on. At a certain point, it doesn't matter how much you care for them, you have to distance yourself to stay safe and to keep them from destroying you too. Eventually, you cut off contact altogether. Some time later, if they are able to get clean/break the cycles, they attempt to contact you again. You are hesitant to see what they want, it feels like a trick. You re-establish some communication, but you are still keeping that person at a distance. How do you know it's safe to trust them again? How do you know they aren't going to burn you on the first chance and go right back to their old habits? Maybe eventually you trust them enough to re-start some semblance of a relationship, but you're going to keep them at arms length for a long time until they have taken real steps to address their issues. You probably might never deeply trust them again.   If we are able to overcome the fascist takeover, and somehow root out the creators of this hatred, we will still have a long way to go before we are ever trusted by any other nation. It doesn't matter that the majority of Americans didn't want *any* of this feckery. It was still able to happen because the way our government is structured allowed it to happen in the first place.

"there's probably lots of components to it, but a few that come to mind are -  the liberal party was originally more about financial liberalism than outright conservatism in the past, it's only recently that most would consider the coalition to be a bona fide conservative party before a liberalism party. so, politically we have had politics very focused on two different brands of centrism for a lot of our history. due to this, australians are not usually huge fans of political extremes on either end, because our overton window for acceptable politics is very orientated towards the moderate centre. we don't like the government getting carried away with things, but we also recognise the necessity of regulation and oversight of some things. port arthur is probably a good example of this - a gun buyback would probably never float in the usa, but here it was seen as a reasonable policy, and most australians still agree with it 2 decades later. and it was by the centre-right party! the usa had big enough ideological splits internally to have a civil war, and the losing people continued to live on afterwards and proliferate their ideas and ideals, and that allowed a basis for ideological notions closer to modern far right american beliefs to remain culturally embedded in communities.  culturally, we don't like pigheadedness. and it is probably a testament to how embedded fair dinkum values have been in our cultural makeup that we value politicians who are honest, fair and down to earth rather than the authoritative peacocking types. dutton positioning himself as a big strong guy and therefore a good leader due to that? i'm not sure it was ever going to work. it's why you see politicians here larp as workers with hi vis during campaigning, that reasonable everyday-family-man type is something we really value. abbott's approval rating was definitely not hurt by the fact that he's a volunteer firefighter and lifeguard - it speaks to having genuine values outside of one's self and one's political ambition.   tall poppy syndrome is unique to australia and new zealand and i think difficult to explain to non-australians, but i wouldn't be surprised if it plays a little into the disapproval of trump (and therefore others who try to mimic him) even before the recent election. we're a culture established by convicts displaced against their will, so naturally, we dislike people visibly flaunting wealth and power, which is why we have a unified distaste towards the likes of gina rhinehart and clive palmer. to lots of americans, trump's wealth and grand-standing about his success and strength means he's succeeded at capitalism, and to them it gives him authority. in australia, it's seen as garish and arrogant. aus respects the british royals due to history - outside of that, culturally, i don't think we could ever have our own royalty. pair this with our general distrust of authority figures and skepticism and you have a population that is more difficult to sell on traditional authoritarian types without sound policy to back them up.  perhaps most importantly, our preferential voting system is very different, and allows people to vote outside of 2 core parties without the vote going to waste. the only way you can waste your vote in aus is by not voting. what that also means is that in the end, most votes will flow down to the main parties - and as we said, those parties are historically mostly centre-ish on the political spectrum, so you inevitably end up with a government that is usually fairly balanced towards the centre. this is changing as the coalition leans further right, but as they do they lose more support, so the government still remains fairly centre. australians largely *want* the political centre. it's well-known so it's safe and stable, and australians are allergic to any form of instability, let alone political instability. the centre is seen as the reasonably middle-ground that can represent the most people. the exceptions to the flow to labor/lnp are increasingly independents, most of whom are centre-aligned. and bob katter. bob katter has held some form of seat in the same region as a socially conservative agrarian socialist for like 50 years. he has held on because he's well-known in his electorate, and despite that agrarian socialism putting him at odds with the rest of the aus political scene and ideologically closer to maoist china, it speaks to the needs of the rural/regional areas he represents as he (and his voters) sees it. bob katter is a very odd exception to the rule.  murdoch media's impact is lesser here because it means changing *culture* here in a way that is less necessary to do for the usa and the uk. that takes a lot of time to do. it doesn't help that sky news is only free in regional aus, and mostly oldies pay for the news nowadays. newer gens aren't watching conventional news stations most of the time either, so they aren't copping that influence.",mantidmarvel,2025-05-06T01:47:59,8

And it's never been controversial up until extremely recently when the right wing in America have started to drum up discontent about it amidst border disputes with a handful of poorer nations.    If the right-wing are now re-writing a narrative that birthright citizenship was only ever really about rehoming black slaves into the broader population after the slave trade ended (and that ever since it achieved that, it's been some sort of defunct concept more abused than used to any good ends for the USA), then that's a very twisted re-imagining of history. ",Creative_Recover,2025-05-05T19:40:50,10

What's changed, it seems, is that you don't like the colours or the more specific nationalities of people now entering your country.

Every country needs border control. But you're talking about stripping literal rights from American people here to tackle a very small issue in society.  Most people born on American soil grow up to be fine citizens. And this stripping of rights is going to do far more harm than good for the average American.    Rights are hard won but easily lost.
