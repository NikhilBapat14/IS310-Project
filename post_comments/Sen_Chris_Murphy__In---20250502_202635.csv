"The Dems must bring this up every chance they get.  Bonus points for it being on Fox.   In Trump 1.0 he seemed to be content ripping off the government by over charging for rooms at his hotels for staff and security detail.  In Trump 2.0 he seems to have much bigger ambitions, the crypto scam alone is worth billions, Amazon spent 40 million for the right for a Melania documentary.    His corruption is a huge national security risk and is literally lighting America’s brand equity on fire.",TubeframeMR2,2025-05-02T20:32:07,47

Do you know what an Executive Order is?   It's a memo. It is literally just an interagency memo. It's used for the president to direct the agencies under him to do/not do something. It does not carry the weight of law. It doesn't change ANYTHING outside the policies and priorities of the Executive Branch.,MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-02T22:55:17,3

"I know exactly what they are. I also never said they were laws!!  You don’t seem to understand that they are official presidential acts that tRump uses to instruct agencies to violate the constitution, to violate the law and to ignore judicial rulings. Those agencies then implement those crimes and there is nothing that can be done about it because the Orange Turd can’t be charged with ordering his people to violate the constitution, to violate the law and to ignore judicial rulings.  Only a congressional impeachment and a senate trial can hold The asshole responsible. That will never happen.  So, idiot can do whatever he wants.",Agent-Adept,2025-05-03T01:23:00,2

You mean Chuck Schumer? Or Nancy Pelosi? What about Jeffries? Be honest man they are not the resistance. No one is resisting anything. The dems who are resisting have no power in the party and may as well be another party disempowered by both republicans and democrats.

"*Sorry, my comment was not clear at all. I wasn't implying at that you don't know what an EO means. I was actually trying to support and reassure you, but failed completely.  Let me try that again:*  According to the immunity ruling, TRUMP may be allowed to *issue* an illegal order and not be arrested for it. But no one under him is absolved of anything if they choose to follow it.  His EO doesn't change the law for anyone else, which is what I meant this first time when I said it doesn't change anything.   For example, a DOGE employee acting on an EO can't physically assault an employee who won't leave a federal building. That DOGE employee can definitely be arrested. If the courts later decide the EO itself was illegal, Trump can't be arrested for issuing it (that's what the immunity ruling meant). The DOGE employees can't be arrested for acting on it *if they believed it to be legal.*. But they CAN be arrested for breaking laws in the process.   That's a black and white example, but the premise stands across a lot of the things executive branch employees are doing. They are illegal and the employees can and hopefully WILL be held accountable eventually. My hope is that if a few people suffer the consequences of acting illegally in furtherance of Trump's agenda, others won't be so quick to act. But that can't happen until the people with the authority to hold them accountable stop being pussies.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-03T11:33:01,2

"Thanks for the explanation!  I appreciate your response. One thing to consider is that anyone below tRump could be arrested for breaking law. Unfortunately, he can just instructed the blonde bimbo Biondi to not pursue prosecution. And, even if the underling is prosecuted and convicted, then the Orange Turd can just pardon them. So, his underlings are relatively free from any concerns about being prosecuted.",Agent-Adept,2025-05-03T12:33:01,1
The law is literally irrelevant if it isn't enforced.    The administration has ignored multiple court orders and nothing happened. It doesn't matter what the law says if there are no consequences for ignoring it. ,fatbunyip,2025-05-03T11:31:18,2
AOC has been shunned and kept out of critical committee positions despite her years of service. She has power within the powerless democratic base. She has been rejected by the democrats who make decisions. Bernie has been independent for over a decade. The democrats are not resisting and if you are hoping for an AOC type character you are hoping for another party. The democrats are a corporate power. In 10-15 years the Democratic Party will be Elissa slotkins not AoCs.,homework8976,2025-05-03T10:07:17,-1

"I think it is amazing that no one comments on the sheer number of executive orders the Orange Turd has written. No president has ever written 150 EOs in their first 100 days. Trump’s EOs literally tell the executive branch to ignore the Constitution, ignore the Law and ignore court orders. Basically, federal agencies are TOLD to break the law.  Why is this happening? The Supreme Court ruled last year that a president cannot be charged with breaking the law if he is performing an official act.  In this situation, the word “act” an official function. Writing EOs is an official act/function of the president. So, he can’t be charged with breaking the law!! What about the agency heads who implement Trump’s flaunting of the law? They’re protected because Trump will instruct the Justice Department to not investigate these individuals illegal act.

It isn’t. If you are unable to see the difference between  the economic power wielded by Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and other establishment dems from the disempowered social power that AOC wields then I would like to have all of your possessions for a whole bunch of high fives.  AOC has support from the American version of the ‘untouchables’ nobody will listen to them and they are moving further and further away from real economic power.
