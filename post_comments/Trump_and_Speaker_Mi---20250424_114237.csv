"> ""I think it would be very disruptive, because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the proposal on Wednesday. ""The old days, they left states. They go from one state to the other. Now with transportation so quick and so easy, they leave countries.""  > ""You’ll lose a lot of money if you do that,"" the president added. ""And other countries that have done it have lost a lot of people. They lose their wealthy people. That would be bad, because the wealthy people pay the tax.""  Right, and next you'll tell me those wealthy tax dollars trickle down to us...",WriterDave,2025-04-24T11:46:13,7
I mean anyone who ever suggested this as a possibility is a moron. There was no way Republicans were gonna raise taxes on rich people lol come on,FunkyChedda,2025-04-24T11:46:37,7
"I remember when this idea was floated as something Trump was considering weeks ago   My Brain was like ""Raise taxes on wealthy? Great policy but since it involves Trump ill believe it when I hear it come out of his mouth""   Absolute shocker that it was bullshit lmao",blues111,2025-04-24T11:45:57,3
"It is very stupid to think that if we tax rich people more, they would simply leave.  First of all, we have very low tax rate comparing to Europe or other developed nations. Unless we raising it to like 70%, they won't go to Europe, and no rich people would wanna make 3rd world country as their primary residence.   Second, the rich people made money in US mostly. They need to stay here for their property, business, connections etc.   Third, if they are moving to the tax Haven countries to avoid higher tax and give up their US citizenship, their houses, businesses etc would all get affected.   I think that depends on how much we are hiking the tax for the rich people. If is just going up to 50% for the marginal tax rate, it is not pushing anyone away.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T11:51:23,3

"Some tidbits,   > A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that 58% of U.S. adults said taxes should go up on households making more than $400,000 per year, including 43% of Republicans.  >  > The tax rate on the highest earners is set to automatically increase from 37% to 39.6% at the end of this year when major portions of Trump's tax cuts from 2017 expire.  >  > An extension of Trump's 2017 tax law is projected to cost $4.6 trillion alone, and Republicans are also pushing for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending.  >  > Johnson also threw cold water on the prospect of a tax hike on Americans making over a million dollars annually.",tech57,2025-04-24T12:28:13,2

"I'd put more stock in that passage if that book didn't also include very specific instructions about honoring and respecting god and parents.   The Christian god never deserves respect, being a jealous psychopath, and many parents do not deserve to be honored.
