Better to go through the process and go on record than to shrug complacently. Yet it does sting knowing it isn’t our first go at this,howcanibehuman,2025-04-28T23:33:52,277
He is unafraid and letting everyone know his intention. Courage is needed when the establishment fell silent and those who are expected to speak out do not and cower. Good for Thanedar.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T23:26:21,201

"Can I just say this is my representative and he’s a useless piece of garbage and he only did this for the points. He’s just like trump in sheep’s clothing and hair. He’s a businessman who paid for his election to represent a poor Black City he knows nothing about. He used PAC money to get himself there. I went to his town hall recently and I couldn’t be more disappointed. Yes he should be impeached, but I hate politicians who do this kind of things for the clout.",Archi_penko,2025-04-29T06:59:25,4
"Shri Thanedar isn’t a real progressive; he’s a performative one. Let’s be clear: Thanedar’s recent stunt introducing articles of impeachment against Trump isn’t bold, it’s bullshit. He knows it won’t pass. Republicans control the House and Senate. There’s zero path forward. So why do it? Because he’s more interested in headlines than results. Thanedar has a pattern of symbolic gestures with no real follow-through. He performs progressivism for clout, tweeting fire and dropping bills he knows are dead on arrival, while rarely building coalitions or pushing winnable policy. That is not strategy; that is ego. This kind of political theater dilutes the power of impeachment, reinforces right-wing narratives about “obsessed Democrats,” alienates swing voters, and wastes valuable political capital. It even pisses off real progressives who want results, not vanity plays. If Thanedar truly cared about protecting democracy, he would focus on legislation that stands a chance, like voting rights, climate action, and economic justice, and he would work on organizing grassroots support. Instead, we get noise. Progressivism is not about optics. It is about outcomes. And Thanedar keeps choosing the former.",fancydad,2025-04-29T10:33:45,2

"If it hadn't been for the first impeachment. we would probably not be where we are now.  Impeachment will cause Republicans to circle the wagons around Trump.  Increasing his popularity is the last thing that Dems should be doing when Trump is busy destroying his own approval ratings.  It's not as if there will be enough votes in the Senate to convict him.  It would be better for more reasoned Dems to pursue use of the 25th amendment.  That also wouldn't lead to his removal, but the focus could be kept on how nuts Trump sounds and it would not require a series of losing votes from Congress.  If anything, it creates opportunities to also go after guys like Hegseth who would have to participate if there was a vote.  ""I rule the world"" sounds like the ramblings of an old man who is on an express train to a nursing home.  It would be better to mock him for imploding than to build him up into the strong man who he longs to be.",I405CA,2025-04-29T00:38:20,-20

"""The second American Revolution will be bloodless... if the left allows it to be.""  They believe that the only Americans left who actually understand that they are having their rights taken away are those on the left.  Personally, I don't know too many people on the right who would be cheering what has been going on if they were in the room when it was happening.  It's easy to say ""Oh, those cancer stricken children weren't deported, their mothers chose to take them back to the country she belongs in"" when you don't have to watch them suffer.

"So you want the public to feel better about Trump and help the GOP win elections.  Yeah, that will teach him.  You do realize that there will be no actual impeachment with a Republican majority in the House and there will never be enough votes in the Senate to convict him, right?  EDIT: The first time that Trump was impeached, the much-anticipated 2020 blue tsunami turned into House losses for the Dems, which then set the stage for the House flipping to the GOP in 2022.  Trump had 4.2 million more votes in 2020 than he had in 2016, in spite of Dems claiming that he would have fewer votes in 2020 than he had preivously.  It also created a surge in GOP turnout that Trump carried into 2024.  The momentum that Biden got from opposing Trump's COVID recklessness did not carry over in the last election.  So yes, you can thank impeachment for flipping the House in 2022 and giving us Trump now.  There would have been a lot fewer GOP voters otherwise.  Democrats can't help but go out of their way to help the other side.",I405CA,2025-04-29T03:07:03,-15
