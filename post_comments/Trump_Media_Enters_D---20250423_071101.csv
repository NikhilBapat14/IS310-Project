"I'm only guessing and it's just my gut instinct, but I know everything Trump has been doing in his ""official"" role, thus far, has something to do with this!! Because: ""Cryptocurrency is not based on the stock market.""  **EDITED TO ADD:** Just to clarify that I do **NOT** think crypto is a good/wise investment decision...  Am I wrong??  >The agreement will allow the president’s social media company to market investment products, including crypto, to retail investors through a series of exchange-traded funds.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-23T07:11:55,9

"Ugh. The conflicts of interest are truly astounding.   As we have seen over the past several weeks, Trump has the ability to crash US equity and debt markets and the dollar. And, despite claims of providing “diversification,” most crypto assets are still broadly correlated to and/ or dependent on US assets (movement typically correlates to tech stocks and, at least for Americans, “real world” use still relies on conversion to dollar). He very well could move markets in a way that aims to sever that relationship, for his and his acolytes benefit.   I still maintain that crypto in its current form is a pump and dump - that’s literally why HODL is a thing. ",No-Marketing-7515,2025-04-23T07:39:39,4

"Dude hates this country, and it's no secret.   Rural America became MAGA due to foxnews and conservative media being allowed (and encouraged) dominance in these areas because it allowed recruitment of young men in rural areas for 20+ years of nonsensical warfare in the ME.   MAGA is the result of using long-term wartime hate propaganda on an already ($7.25) poor populace.   The country is getting grifted because it normalized behavior it would have considered egregious 20 years ago, all for a nothing war.",watcherofworld,2025-04-23T07:28:06,11
"* Via Wiki: El Salvador became the first country in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, after it was adopted as such by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador in 2021.\[1\] It has been promoted by Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, who claimed that it would improve the economy by making banking easier for Salvadorans, and that it would encourage foreign investment. In 2022, more Salvadorians had Bitcoin Lightning wallets than bank accounts. * Via the web, and ""El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender is generally considered a failure, despite some initial positive publicity."" El Salvador's initial experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender has faced challenges and is now being re-evaluated, with the country scaling back its Bitcoin policies, including the requirement that businesses accept it.   **P.S.

"Yes, agree with your point.  But, my point is that the way he's been screwing around with the tariffs as well as the stock market...all of that kind of makes his venture into crypto (which the interest is not based on how the stock market does like a regular ""cash"" investment) seem intentional for HIS personal gain??

"Well he definitely hates this country’s institutions. I truly believe we are in the situation we’re in because he never felt accepted among the Ivy League, blue-blood society in NY or Palm Beach.

"Yeah, it is intentional, you're not wrong. But it's also lowkey kinda obvious because he (used to, before Citizens United) owes a significant amount of debt and losses in trials. The dollar losing value, and increasing in circulation only helps his lifestyle.
