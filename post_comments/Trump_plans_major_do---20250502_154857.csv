"Media complicity once again. Plan? Look I get that Project 2025 is a blueprint, and I get that they’ve taken many actions. But a plan, to me, means that you have some semblance of a grasp on what could go wrong. It means you have an idea as to the impact, short and long-term, of the actions you take.   This administration might have a plan, but it’s sure as shit not a plan for the American people.",johhnny5,2025-05-02T22:22:33,1

"Generational damage to our intelligence apparatus. Absolutely no one of quality would ever agree to work for or spy for the US for decades after this. The buffonery, the unprofessionalism, the incompetence at the highest levels, it's a fucking disgrace.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-02T16:38:51,7
