Let me guess: it's a state secret why the judge isn't allowed to ask about things the administration say are state secrets.,nimbus57,2025-05-07T19:39:02,20
"We know the person involved, we know where they used to be and where they are now. We know the flight they put him on and what he is accused of.  So the state secret is who exactly ignored the judges order to turn the plane around and the government needs that to be a secret because... they don't want that person to face consequences for ignoring a judges order.",The_Frostweaver,2025-05-08T03:00:53,6

Folks... This is yet another DISTRICT JUDGE. They are the same as middle school hall monitors. Nothing they rule can or will be enforced. Why? It's the DOJ's job.
