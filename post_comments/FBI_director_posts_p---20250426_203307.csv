"""Just fine"" in that she is very likely to beat the case against her. But this is a life-changing ordeal that could easily have career-ending, or at least career changing ramifications even if she beats the charges. Her and her family are going to require security and protection from harassment, stalking, and doxing for years.   So, I'd highly agree that she probably beats the charges, but I'd say it's too soon to see if she's ""just fine"" from it.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-26T21:08:59,58
