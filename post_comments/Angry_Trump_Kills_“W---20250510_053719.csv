Remember when there was a possibility of revitalizing rural areas with remote workers?  And then corporations and the government demanded nobody move to these areas because they needed warm bodies to occupy useless buildings?  And then the US government demanded we stop providing internet to rural areas?  And then they laid off a bunch of the workers they demanded go into the useless buildings?  I‚Äôm starting to think we‚Äôve lost the thread here. It kind of seems like the government is just disassembling the country for parts (because it is).,BeMancini,2025-05-10T06:58:46,29
