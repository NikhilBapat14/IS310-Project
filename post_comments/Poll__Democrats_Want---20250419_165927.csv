"•This week, RealClearPolitics reported on a poll from Survey USA that found 74% of Democrats either want the party to be even more “progressive” (50%) or like it just the way it is (24%). Fewer than one in five wants the party to move toward the center.    Leftists have lost all touch with reality.",chances906,2025-04-19T17:13:51,101
"I think it's the other way around. Democrat voters don't have any opinions of their own. Every single thing they value is chosen by the party. They are told to support both Ukraine and Gaza/Iran at the same time. They're told men can get pregnant, and can whip it out in the women's locker rooms. They call Trump a dictator despite being allowed to call him a dictator, and think only the government should have guns. They want to Tax The Rich but not the rich in other countries. Claim to be pro-choice except with Big Pharma experiments. Lock down for the sniffles! They can be instigated to riot before sunrise over a lie or hoax. Their position on slavery hasn't changed in centuries, importing cheap crop-pickers, leaf-blowers, and lemon-pledgers. Held peaceful protesters hostage for 3 years without trial but suddenly care about Due Process™  My favorite is that they oppose the Death Penalty, but support Mangione.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-19T18:57:49,52

The delusional weirdo freaks have completely taken over that party.  It's over for them. More easy 90/10 issue wins for us.,____IIIII___ll__I,2025-04-19T18:54:41,32
"One thing is certainly clear. Regardless of how normal, common sense the American people voted, the Left will never look in the mirror and correct the radicalization of their party. THIS is the hill they are willing to die on.",Flare4roach,2025-04-19T18:45:14,31
At this point I fully believe that the left is being radicalized only to keep the plebs fighting each other in order to make the aristocracy safe from the country uniting against them.,Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-04-19T20:47:43,8

Yea. No thank you.,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-19T17:02:28,10
They lost the election because they are too far left.  Pandering to the vocal minority is what they were doing and it didn't work.  So I equate this with their base appealing to do more of what caused them to lose.    I accept these terms.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-20T14:05:45,5
It's funny. They think the moderates are the ones holding them back. Lol!,thebp33,2025-04-20T09:55:26,2
