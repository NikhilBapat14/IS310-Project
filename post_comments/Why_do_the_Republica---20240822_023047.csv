It's not so much that they don't embrace their previous leaders. It's that the previous leaders dislike Trump enough that they refuse to show up and endorse him.   Rs currently in power rely on him for power. Those who retired have nothing to lose and so don't kiss the ring.,ShadeofIcarus,2024-08-22T10:36:21,278
"The Democrats had candidates from 1992 - present speak at the convention.  Let's look at the pool of Republican Presidential/Vice Presidential candidates from that period  1992 President George HW Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle - Bush is deceased, and does anyone want Quayle to speak to the convention  1996 Candidates Bob Dole and Jack Kemp-  both are deceased  2000 Candidates George W. Bush and Dick Cheyney - both hate Trump  2004 see above  2008 Candidates John McCain and Sarah Palin - McCain is deceased and no one wants Palin to speak at the convention  2012 Candidates Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan - both hate Trump  2016 Candidates Donald Trump and Mike Pence - Trump did speak for himself.  Pence isn't on good terms with Trump, quite possibly because a MAGAt crowd tried to lynch him.  2020 see above",EssayGuilty722,2024-08-22T11:52:24,104
"The republican party had major internal revolutions after bush.   reagan to bush in the republican party was the era of the neoconservatives.  Bush and the gwot were considered such failures that neoconservatism became a sorta taboo idea, and many neocons lost seats to the populist oriented tea party between 08 and 10.   Romney's loss in 12 was the nail in the coffin for neoconsrvatism, and the populist tea party shored up its dominance. Between 14 and 16, neoconservatism is totally ousted from the party.   From that point on, youre basically looking at a different sort of ideology in the party. A neocon like bush or romney has more in common with a neoliberal like obama than they do with populists like the current party, and so the current party doesnt really like them all too much.",_vercingtorix_,2024-08-22T11:02:21,36

"There has been a split in the Republican Party between what we can call the ""populist"" and the ""traditional"" wings of the GOP.  It's easy to miss this because the Republicans seem to be in lock-step  but that is a facade.    There are _plenty_ of ""traditionalist"" Republicans out there in the party, but nearly all of them would rather be in power and have to kowtow to the populist wing of the party than out-of-power.  So they kiss the ring.  But retired Republicans don't have to make that choice.    This is why so many Republican luminaries have simply vanished from public life while they hang on in the Democratic Party.  Once they're no longer running for office and therefore beholden to the populists and their high-primary-turnout, those old, retired traditionalists don't have any incentive to put up with Trump and his odious cult of personality.   So they refuse to kiss the ring and, as such, aren't invited to speak.  You can tell a lot about where the rifts are in the GOP by who was and wasn't invited to speak.",Killfile,2024-08-22T11:00:01,31
"Bush was wildly unpopular when he left office. Reagan was definitely still embraced, but he was old enough that he died quickly. That's pretty much all the former Republican presidents. You've also seen a much greater degree of platform change between Republican candidates than we've seen with the Dems. The difference between Trump and Bush is much, much larger than the difference between Obama and Biden or even Clinton and Biden. It makes a lot more sense for the Dems to rely more on their former leaders considering they're still popular AND relevant among the political class. The same simply can't be said for the Reps.",mormagils,2024-08-26T13:05:03,2

True but it also has to do with the fact that for better or worse Trump is seen as the resistance to the establishment Republicans and Democrats so it wouldn't make any sense to invite them to the party. And even Republicans that are not on board with Trump are still probably not sold on a Romney or Bush. But it is a strange situation where Trump saved and destroyed the Republican party.,brinerbear,2024-08-23T07:23:40,0

"Nixon killed the Party of Lincoln with his 1968 Southern Strategy to win over Dixiecrats angry with LBJ over Civil Rights and Voting Rights. Then Reagan doubled down on regional bigotry by welcoming the religious zealots from the so called “Moral Majority” into the GOP.   Daddy Bush got hit with some of the delayed consequences of Reagan’s poor decisions and wasn’t charismatic enough to obfuscate them effectively.   Dubya got hit with the rest of the consequences from Reagan/GHWBush’s foreign and economic policy blunders. Then he made a phenomenal error by listening to greedy Warhawks in his administration to invade Iraq under false pretenses.  George Dubya Shrub’s betrayal of public trust and incompetent leadership culminated in the 2008 financial collapse. Ever since then, no one in the Republican Party wants to be associated with his administration or their destructive policies.   The fact that Trump is probably worse than all of them with his LIES, hate mongering, false claims of victim hood, and his brazen attempt to undermine our Constitutional Democratic Republic is truly remarkable. He will go down in history as one of the worst Presidents in US history.",auldnate,2024-08-22T14:15:11,17

"> Once they're no longer running for office and therefore beholden to the populists and their high-primary-turnout, those old, retired traditionalists don't have any incentive to put up with Trump and his odious cult of personality.   And to go a step further, many Republicans actually *embrace* them not being in support of Trump or the populism that he ""represents"" (this is a debate for another day).  The populist logic is basically ""I held my nose and supported your choice of candidates in McCain and Romney, but now you're upset that we didn't support Jeb and instead supported the populist candidate.""  The idea being that the traditional Republicans never really valued/supported the goals of the populists, but were instead content to pretend to so long as those populists did as they were told.",LordFoxbriar,2024-08-22T11:09:22,13

"And Mike Pence credits his son with him sticking around. Mike Pence had said he was convinced he wasn't going to go along with the fake elector scheme and was going to excuse himself from the electoral counting process, leaving Grassley to run it (this might be where the rumor that Grassley was going to run it came from). Mike Pence told his son that, and his son convinced him he had to stay involved and do the right thing by reminding him he took an oath to protect the Constitution, not to sit by while other people attack it.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/29/mike-pence-son-trump-jan-6",ProLifePanda,2024-08-22T16:39:17,26

"I think the problem is that the base isn’t really aligned with a lot of the popular voices in media, like Shapiro or Megyn. Like 70% of republicans felt that the election was stolen but not any of the “mainstream” voices wanted to touch the topic for fear of seeming extreme. That’s a crazy percentage to just not really have anyone to voice their thoughts. (Other than trump… who probably voiced it a bit too much)  I feel like you’ll find the true base’s feelings better from random voices on twitter like Catturd… who’s not really a known name among normal people.",knightbaby,2024-08-22T17:29:01,2
