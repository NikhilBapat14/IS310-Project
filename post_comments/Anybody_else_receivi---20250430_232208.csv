"Do they even know that Anglo-Saxon is a very specific ethnicity that probably doesn‚Äôt include them?

"813 is a Florida Tampa Bay area code.  I know phone numbers aren't as simple to pin down as they used to be, but there are STRONG odds that this text might actually be coming from Florida (given the state's political reputation).   Also, I'm not a lawyer and I would definitely not take my word over a lawyer's professional opinion... This reads like a recruitment/solicitation piece. Regardless of what we might INFER, or INTERPRET, or ASSUME, all of the language is present to qualify it as such. ""Join""... And then a capitalized title which could be inferred as a group.   Again. Not a lawyer. But I happened to see that your text was received at 12:15 AM. And a quick Google search of Florida phone solicitation rules shows me that phone calls must be made within the window of 8 AM and 8 PM. And there's also certain licensing requirements that come with phone solicitation.  Yes, it would be a massive stretch. But all I'm saying is that a report to the BBB might get a toe in the door. Maybe. Honestly, at this point I'm willing to try anything.",IslandFearless2925,2025-05-01T01:37:06,20
