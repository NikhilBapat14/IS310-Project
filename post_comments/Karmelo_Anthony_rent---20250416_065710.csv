The money they got would have been enough for some down payments on the car and the home but it's definitely not enough to make the monthly payments, were they already well off? Beyond the obvious unethical use of the money and possible fraud, how does this actually make sense?   Realistically is this going to end with their son in jail and their family bankrupt? Well to be honest the son probably won't go to jail because the left will riot and threaten the jury I'm sure",fordr015,2025-04-17T12:06:33,1

Anyway….a guilty verdict will result in riots and targeted attacks….and they (officials) know it….but more alarming is that the general public knows this to and will only incite more and more of this savage behavior because “they” know “they” can get away with it without severe repercussions or any repercussions at all….all it takes is one cry of “racism” and it’s an auto get out of jail card.",tsoxiko,2025-04-17T05:57:02,1
