Shoutout to someone who knew how to strategically resign.,Pike_Gordon,2025-05-09T11:07:17,6
"85? When did he retire? He should‚Äôve been in there until today, per RBG great example. /s",f1rstg1raffe,2025-05-09T10:06:48,2
We won't dodge a bullet on this indefinitely.  We desperately need Dem control of the Senate in 2026 with an overt commitment not to ever seat a Trump appointee.,MC_Fap_Commander,2025-05-09T09:43:37,14
"He retired immediately following Bush v Gore. He was so disgusted that he lost the desire to continue.  Guy was pure integrity. Appointed by Bush, Sr. as a reliable conservative justice. On the bench, he called ‚Äòem as he saw ‚Äòem, politics be damned.   He‚Äôll be sorely missed.",barney_muffinberg,2025-05-09T11:41:27,5
This guy retired in 2009,Lantis28,2025-05-09T10:50:21,3
"There‚Äôs almost zero chance the Dems regain the Senate in ‚Äò26. They need to gain at least 3 seats (4 if you don‚Äôt trust Fetterman), while holding onto Georgia, Virginia, Michigan, Minnesota, and New Hampshire.  And the only Republican seat at risk is Maine. Then you have the ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre totally gonna flip this year‚Äù seats with North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Ohio.   Don‚Äôt get your hopes up.",ButchBulldog,2025-05-09T13:01:46,2
I appreciate the background! Sounds like we could use some more like him,f1rstg1raffe,2025-05-09T11:52:30,3
He retired in 2009 actually,seriousofficialname,2025-05-09T13:43:45,1
"The '26 map is ugly.  But Trump's polling is abysmal (and will get worse when the full ramifications of his economic policies hit).  The Ultra Trumpy GOP tends to run weirdos predisposed to lose statewide elections (like the Porn Nazi guy going for governor in NC and the Mall Creeper in AL).  So who knows?  If there's any hope, we gotta give it all we can.  We will get an obit or retirement announcement about a sitting Justice in the coming years.  If there's even a chance of blocking confirmation, we gotta push for it.",MC_Fap_Commander,2025-05-09T14:11:48,2
Definitely. Changed his judicial philosophy because he actually LEARNED. Ultimate sign of intelligence.,barney_muffinberg,2025-05-09T11:57:35,2
Oops. üòÇ  I do know the decision weighed on him heavily. He felt their ruling (and their insistence that it never establish precedent) was beyond unjust. Perhaps I‚Äôm confusing a report that he strongly considered resigning over it.,barney_muffinberg,2025-05-09T18:35:16,1
