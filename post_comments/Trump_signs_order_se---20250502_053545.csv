> • Trump signed an order seeking to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS. • The order accuses NPR and PBS of biased and partisan coverage. • The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop funding NPR and PBS.  Straight out of the authoritarian playbook.,WorldInWonder,2025-05-02T05:37:38,18
"This Republican Congress is so complicit in all of this. Not one of them is serving in the capacity they were entrusted to serve. The budget belongs to them, not the Executive.   They let him do it so that they can claim no responsibility later. But they're watching it happen and doing nothing.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T05:54:06,8

Yet Trump has no problem spending MILLIONS of our tax dollars on his weekly golf trips and leisure activities.,Funky-Buddah,2025-05-02T08:59:08,2
Facts don’t equal bias. The guy is well documented for lying. His administration is blatantly disregarding court decisions. Maybe if he wasn’t writing a bunch of BS executive orders and actually did something decent for America he would like the news about him? You can’t just make sheet up and say everything is great and expect media to report it.,nopulsehere,2025-05-02T09:11:32,2
Isn’t funding super small amount? Another good soundbite for hatefilled base to eat up with glee. ,Stunning_Actuator_61,2025-05-02T10:32:26,1
When was the last time anyone watched PBS. We have more important issues for tax payer $$.,Spiritual_Agent_6817,2025-05-02T11:46:25,1

How is that? A great many dont believe the taxpayer should be funding or paying for these entities. It's hardly authoritarian to expect them to fund themselves in their entirety.,cheff546,2025-05-02T05:43:01,-28

Presidential edicts are authoritarian.,ItsJustForMyOwnKicks,2025-05-02T05:51:32,9
And a great many don’t even understand the full scope of what these entities provide for (especially rural) communities. Stop making other people check your work.,Ok_Courage3765,2025-05-02T05:54:18,9
"Isn't the funding supposed to be appropriated by Congress? Else, he's acting as a dictator.",vteckickedin,2025-05-02T06:10:03,6
"Because, whether you approve of NPR/PBS or not, it's not the president's place to cut funding by decree. Congress is supposed to control the purse strings and make laws. The judicial, up to the Supreme Court, is supposed to interpret and explain the law. The executive is supposed to enforce, or execute the law.   We currently have a president who wants to control spending by decree (authoritarian). He wants to create law by decree (authoritarian). He wants to decide what the law means and punish judges who do not agree with him (authoritarian). Even if you agree with the man 100%, there's no way to take an honest look at what he's doing and say he isn't behaving in an authoritarian way. To make that claim is to deny facts.",ManimalBestShowEva,2025-05-02T07:07:55,3

Dude this isnt the 1970s. The idea that these entities provide a vital link to news in undeserved areas is nonsense. Everyone has access to news and information if they want it. Government funded news is not required.,cheff546,2025-05-02T05:59:28,-13
