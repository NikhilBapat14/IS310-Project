">The move against ActBlue raised alarms among critics who viewed it as a way for Trump to use the power of the government against his political opponents.   >Some Democrats had issued statements earlier in the week sounding alarms that the White House might target nonprofit groups. White House officials said there was no such order in the works.  >Trump earlier this month signed memos directing the Justice Department to investigate two critics: Miles Taylor, who wrote an anonymous op-ed in 2018 criticizing the administration while he worked for the Department of Homeland Security, and Chris Krebs, who served as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and pushed back on Trumpâ€™s claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-24T15:15:48,7

"This is a full on sprint! Dump feels he is losing his bigly plot to be Americas first dictator (in his case dic-less-tator)   With the economy tanking,  China showing him up publicly at every opportunity,  courts spanking his immigration policies down,  his circus monkey Hegseth performing fabulously with his new make-up booth and using signal from within the pentagon to break federal law.   I realize this only about half of the scandals and controversies just from within the last week or two. Itâ€™s so exhausting.

"There is an old admonishment for finger pointing: 'When you point one finger, there are three fingers pointing back to you.""   This 100% how Republicans live, whatever they are using one finger to point at it is because they already know they have three pointing at themselves.   Part of it is muddying the waters, if they get caught doing something, by accusing Democrats of doing it first they can distract people by making it a ""both sides"" issue. The other is they lack imagination and understanding, if they are doing something they assume eveyone in thier shoes would do the same thing and so accuse Democrats.",pgm_01,2025-04-24T15:44:23,7

"Well, yes. Trump ran to get the charges against him dropped, and then to get revenge on those he sees as enemies. He is also there to grift, but his whole existence is dedicated to the grift. All other actions are basically about political favors for those that helped to get him back in the White House.",pgm_01,2025-04-24T16:59:38,3
