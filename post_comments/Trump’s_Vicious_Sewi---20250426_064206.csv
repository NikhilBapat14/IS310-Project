"Times Opinion columnist Maureen Dowd writes:  >All the talk about more traditional gender roles hearkens back to a time when women were seen as biologically unfit to hold higher office. For centuries, women were thought to be too high-strung and unstable to have a hand in running world affairs.      What if women got into the highest echelons of government, determining life and death, war and peace, and began gossiping, catfighting, backbiting and clawing each other’s eyes out? And everyone knew, of course, that women were more deceptive.      So it is grimly entertaining to see this most “masculine” of administrations reflecting stereotypes about female behavior that long kept women out of power.      Trump’s macho crew, it turns out, is a vicious little sewing circle.

"Think about the evolution (side note: I’m in agreement with you). During the revolutionary war, Americans had a life expectancy of 35-40 years old. Imagine living with that type of existence and how it would influence you to overthrow a king. Nothing to lose right?  Now today, it’s 77-80. That’s a long life with children that make it out of childhood and continue the line. There’s also a requirement of a two person household (job wise) to make this happen without poverty.  What is going to push two people, in a bumpy economy who did or did not vote for that chaos, regretting their vote or not, push them over the edge?   The country is soooo large. We are so disconnected. As small communities within borders we make change but as a whole we cannot organize nor will all of us organize/protest over the same principles.   We are comfortable. Previous decades of colonialism, war away from our shores, being the planet’s go to protectors, has made us soft.   We won’t even do anything profound about school shootings.   What makes us think we can turn over a tyrant physically. We’ll miss dinner or get fired for not showing up.",gnapster,2025-04-27T05:35:06,1
