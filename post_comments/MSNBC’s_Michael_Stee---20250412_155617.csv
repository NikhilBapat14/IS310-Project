"It's necessary to visit the home state or home district offices of Capitol Hill Republicans propping up Trump's demented attack on the US government.   Calling or emailing these folks does little good. They will claim you are a bot or AI. When you personally visit their offices and leave a short handwritten message fastened to a reproduction of your voter registration card, they won't be able to write you off.   While the rep or senator almost certainly won't be there at the time of your visit, they will certainly be notified of your visit via their staff.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-12T16:45:18,1
