"""Johnson signaled there is little appetite for judicial impeachments among House Republican leaders.""   And this is why I'm not a Republican.  These mealy mouth sacks of manure just can't stomach doing something.  They're just there for the $174k paycheck.     If you don't take care of the problem, it will continue to be a problem.  Do your fucking jobs.",j3remy2007,2025-05-06T19:44:16,10
I’d agree with Johnson. Not enough votes for that. Not now anyway.,ITrCool,2025-05-06T16:27:43,8
"Look, impeachments are never off the table if it's merited. But in our system, we've had 15 federal judges impeached in the entire history of the country. I mean, there may be some that I feel merit that, but you’ve got to get the votes for it, right? And it's a very high burden,"" Johnson said.  Johnson, you are to weak to be in the position you are in, you are part of the problem, get out of the way and let someone with courage to take your place. We don’t ask you to determine bill outcomes in the Senate, we ask you to pass legislation in the house. You’re not responsible for the Senate.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T16:37:24,3
"For goodness sake, Johnson needs to grow a pair. We don’t need to be dragging down all the judges overstepping their bounds, just go after a few of the worst offenders. Boasberg springs to mind, for instance.   The impeachment process is the wake-up call for both the out of control activist class of the judiciary as well as Roberts to get off his butt and do a better job of running his house.",docholiday999,2025-05-06T17:25:48,0

"Then what are the Republicans there to do?  Just collect a paycheck?  What actually has been done since January 1st, extending the country's debt limit.  What a waste of having the House, the Senate, the White House, and SCOTUS on our side.",j3remy2007,2025-05-06T19:46:22,11
The problem with the whole this doesn't happen very often stance is that well maybe it needed to happen more and we wouldn't be in this spot now. Truth over tradition,wv_lookin_around,2025-05-06T16:50:29,13
"What’s Johnson got to do with it? The votes aren’t there, they won’t ever be there and there’s nothing Johnson can do about it.  Going on about impeachment is just red meat for conservatives and a waste of time.    How about using congressional energy to codify Trumps agenda instead?",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-05-06T18:01:14,4
Barely the Senate. Not one Dem will switch sides to vote in the 2/3 majority it would take to convict even if the House managed to impeach them. That’s the problem here. Impeachments are still blocked.,ITrCool,2025-05-06T19:51:02,3

They don’t want to codify his agenda (or the mandate for agenda that the citizens gave) because it threatens their own power and positions.,Shooter_McGavin27,2025-05-06T18:38:22,2
I realize impeaching could be a waste of time. The issue of Johnson being weak and impeachment are unrelated.  You can do it easier in defunding the courtroom. Abolish the court he is in. It is legal and can be done.,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T18:55:21,3
