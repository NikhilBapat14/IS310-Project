"I'd look up the textbook for a college level intro to political science.  One of those should cover those questions well, though I can't say for certain that they would nor do I have one to recommend.  You can sometimes find such textbooks at a local library (or request one through interlibrary exchange programs)",zlefin_actual,2024-10-23T14:29:25,2

"Frankly, there are about a million books that will give you the basics and all of them will have most of the same content. I'd recommend the same as others--find an Intro to Political Science book that's used in colleges, and just read it cover to cover. It will give you just about everything you need to start yourself on a solid foundation for a data-based and scientific approach to politics.  One additional tip would be to look at anything that is an intro to Comparative Politics. Comp Pol in particular tends to emphasize a more structural approach, which 100% is the best way to develop your thinking in this field. A more general book is fine too, but if you want to dive down to something specific, comp pol is the way to go.  The one I used in school was Intro to Comparative Politics by Clark, Golder, and Golder. It's a great option. You can also find literally any other that looks similar and it would be roughly the same quality.",mormagils,2024-10-24T16:00:12,1
