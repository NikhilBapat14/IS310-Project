"oh look, the do nothing moderates are trying to copy the tactics of the progressives who are gaining momentum.   Unless Pete has changed his platform. He's one of the democrats who enabled this mess.",DamphairCannotDry,2025-05-02T13:52:48,-6
Oh yay is he going to knee cap the progressives again in a bid to get an appointment?  We don’t need former McKinsey consultants pitching their weak vision for the future.,SpecializedCoffee,2025-05-02T14:24:17,-7

Not anymore. They lost the first in the nation status for the democratic primaries due to incompetence and unwillingness to move from caucuses to primaries.   And they deserve it.,washu_z,2025-05-02T16:20:58,11

Care to elaborate?  What’s weak about Pete’s vision of the future?  I’m curious.,mjc4y,2025-05-02T18:37:23,1

"While actually believing in progressive policies, he dared to offer a stepping stone compromise that was actually passable through Congress to make progress towards the goal instead of holding out for only perfect solutions that have a snowballs chance of getting through Congress anytime soon, forever earning the wrath of the Bernie Bros.",paintedcheese,2025-05-02T18:52:36,7
"I don’t think South Carolina is the best first state for the Dems (for the record I think it should rotate or be regional) but it makes more sense than Iowa. It’s much more diverse, and it’s the fastest growing state in the nation — particularly with young professionals.",washu_z,2025-05-02T19:00:29,2

The thing that seems to always get lost in these conversations about changing first primary/caucus state is that Iowans are a lot more politically engaged in the process and have a good track record for democrats (republicans not so much). Bernie almost beat Hillary and if they hadn’t fumbled Pete might have ran away with the nomination. I fear that South Carolina or any state that party leadership throws their weight behind will result in a guaranteed establishment pick,panic_the_digital,2025-05-02T21:28:16,1
"Pete is progressive. He is for things like Medicare for All. But Pete is a pragmatic progressive. He realized Congress would not get the votes to pass M4A anytime soon, so he presented a stepping stone policy, Medicare for All who want it -- basically expanding Medicare without yet fully getting rid of the option for private insurance.  To the Bernie Bros, this attempt to actually move things forward with something that could potentially actually pass through Congress, was seen as a capitulation to Private Insurance interest and a betrayal of all things progressive. This led them to call Pete a Republican in disguise, among many other things.",paintedcheese,2025-05-02T21:05:57,5
"The caucuses have been a shitshow in Iowa for at least 16 years now and the Democratic Party has been almost completely wiped out of statewide office [“almost” solely due to Rob Sand, protect this man at all costs]. They let all three branches of Iowa government fall wholly to the grip of republicans. Don’t get me wrong it didn’t help that the national Dem organization abandoned them. But now even moderate/left leaning city councils are being overrun. I’m not saying to abandon Iowa— I’ve lived here my whole life and have been to every caucus since I was four years old. But I am saying the it’s not exactly a great place to put on stage for the future of the Democratic Party, level of engagement be damned.",washu_z,2025-05-02T21:36:33,2
