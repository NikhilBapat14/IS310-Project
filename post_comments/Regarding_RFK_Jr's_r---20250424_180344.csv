"If you rank someone’s value as a human based on their ability to generate tax revenue, you are well past the point of redemption. RFK Jr’s stances are heavily eugenics-coded.",pgc60001,2025-04-25T05:52:00,206
"I think you're giving him too much credit for having 'priorities'.  His only goal is to impose his worldview on a set of organizations that have historically been impartial and apolitical.  The fact that his worldview is nucking futz is just the byproduct of a diseased mind so entrenched in the elitist everything-is-safe worldview that he is willing to peddle stupidity and snake oil because 'they never hurt anyone', nevermind the fact that if he ever looked beyond his own stunted horizons he would find a world littered with corpses from COVID denialism, anti-vaxx fatalism, and the side-effects of snake oil propaganda.  RFK Jr. is the real result of proper regulatory regimes - a man so stealthily insulated from all the potential dangers of the world that he has been convinced they aren't real.",cromethus,2025-04-25T10:06:41,58

"It makes me think about a scene from the first episode of The Man In The High Castle where a highway patrolman, after helping a protagonist change the tire on his truck and offering to share his lunch asks for protag's transit papers. It then starts ""snowing"" which the highway patrolman clarifies is the local hospital cremating the cripples and terminally ill; always remember that under fascist regimes that's what they think of ""useless"" people.

>Is this how we want our leaders to talk about disability? Should someone's ability to contribute to the tax base determine how we discuss their worth or needs?  No and no.  This is valuing human beings solely for how they can serve the state. It is a complete dismissal of basic human dignity and individual rights.  Sound familiar? It should.,BitterFuture,2025-04-25T06:55:27,8
"The right always goes nuts about this stuff, panics about the financial implications, and then get into either Eugenics, mass murder, or both.  The weird thing here is that it's really about different approaches to the American healthcare system. Both the right and left have major issues with Big Pharma, on the left that's developed into 'wellness' culture, and on the right it's wrapped around the idea that disease doesn't really exist, it can be cured for free (or by horse dewormer which has its own crazy conspiracy around it), and therefore Big Pharma isn't needed.  Either way, in RFK's case, it's not really about the money so much as it is about trying to prove disease is an illusion.",epsilona01,2025-04-25T05:54:11,16

"I don't think he knows how to *sound* compassionate or thoughtful.  He's been dangerously dumb for decades.  With that said, people are too willing to substitute malice for stupidity here.  RFK's messaging on the issue has basically been a blunt force description of what he believes are the effects of autism on the people impacted by those who have to care for those with the condition.  It's not how we generally talk about disabilities and other mental illnesses anymore, so it *sounds* out of pocket, but he's just old and dumb.    Don't overthink it.  RFK Jr. should not be anywhere near any levers of power, but not because of the language he chooses to use.  It's because he's a god-awful conspiracy theorist.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-25T09:24:04,11

"He created a cherry picked rage narrative. He cherry picked cases of autism. He meant severe, nonverbal autism, which is quite awful and fits his description. He left out many other kinds of autism, but he wanted to keep his terms simple. Then he cherry picked the causes, not from any really identified cause, but the idea that it's something environmental (leaving out the problem of changing criteria for autism spectrum diagnoses). Then he cherry picked from the future, of course. He will find the answer by September (which is in the future).   He was hired to cherry pick and that is what he's doing. The Left launches, as usual, into their retort, missing what he really meant (which was not high functioning autism). This only helps steel the Right, who use the Left's criticisms, as the ""white lines"" within which to drive (e.g., ""Trump is sounding like HITLER"" -- ""Otay, we'll just steer short of actually being Hitler, bet you did nazi that coming!"", and they don't see it coming).",ravia,2025-04-26T20:23:34,1

"I think he's a complete psychopath, but remember who is target audience is. He was hired to be a manager, in an administration obsessed with efficiency, and who takes delight in publicly eschewing compassion or personal dignity. If we take at face value his concern over autism, what would be a better case to make? Certainly not ""let's take care of these poor children at the taxpayer's expense."" No, he is framing this as win for the treasury and an alignment to the stated priorities of the administration.  I hope nobody reads this as being pro-RFK, Jr--far from it. I just think this is a verbal nitpick on what is sure to be a much broader problem to focus on. If we get bogged down in weekly press event skirmishes about nothing, it's going to be much harder to make a compelling case to voters who decide elections.",xXxdethl0rdxXx,2025-04-25T10:56:00,1
Compassion and Dignity don’t solve actual problems.   All the individual compassion in the world isn’t going to stop polio or lead poisoning. Unrelenting honestly about the scope and cost and cause of the problem is the truly compassionate thing to do. Working to prevent the millions of future people from being affected by a preventable tragedy is far more compassionate than simply being kind to one individual.,slayer_of_idiots,2025-04-27T12:01:43,1

"He isn't looking into the causes. He is attempting to force his perspective and will cherry pick anything that 'supports' it, even if it's wrong.   We have a greater incidence of it because we're able to see more things, we learned more about it. When mammograms became a thing, incidents of finding breast cancer went up like, 300%.....nothing changed other than understanding what we were looking for. When we stopped treating left handedness as a tool of the devil, more people were willing to say they were left handed.  What RFK Jr is doing is starting from a position of 'I know this' and wants to get rid of the people who have something rather than understanding and adapting society to include.   Autistic people aren't broken, they aren't dregs, they aren't burdens. They need to be understood and if they are, our societal perspectives on how people learn can grow exponentially and give us more problem solving tools.   This dude doesn't give a shit about solving problems and including humans, he just wants to get rid of what he doesn't want to see.",datalicearcher,2025-04-25T16:22:58,16
"He is not the only one asking the question. There has been decades of research. The cause of autism has to do with epigenetics and prenatal conditions and a bunch of other factors. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE, but he’s saying he will find one.   It is complex and multifaceted and the data of reported diagnoses are conflated by different factors as well.   He has rejected the data that exists and the consensus of extensive scientific literature. He’s doing his own studies to find an answer he likes better.
