"New Mexico has a very high Hispanic population (almost 60%) and a relatively high percentage of Native Americans (over 10%). Both of these numbers are higher than most other Western states, and both of these demographics vote disproportionately Democratic. As a result, New Mexico has been a liberal-leaning state for a long time.  Colorado, on the other hand, was a solidly red state until the 2000s. Its shift leftward began in that decade, when it began attracting a large population of transplants from other states that were disproportionately young, more diverse, educated, and liberal-leaning, drawn to Colorado's outdoorsy culture. A lot of what makes western states red is that they're overwhelmingly rural, and rural voters tend to vote Republican. But as western cities grow, those states can shift quickly.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-23T22:16:46,5
You could also ask why do they vote blue amongst a large swath of blue states since they are situated next to the west coast which consistently vote blue. Theres also Nevada and Arizona which have voted blue. You have to look at the congressional/district maps and population…..if you look at them you will see that no state is act a red or blue state….its more of how many of both red and blue districts a state has and the population of those districts are….even here in Texas we have large blue districts but due to the large size and population of the state the blue districts have yet to overtake the red even though the combined population of both is about equal…..also here in Texas to make matters worse it is a state with traditional low voter turnout this why it still stuck red then if you look at Florida it’s blue districts have been both shrinking and heavily gerrymandered,juggalosithlord,2024-07-28T18:55:06,1
Educated? You mean indoctrinated. Knowing about accounting doesnt' make someone more likely to vote democrat. It's going to a university where they are indoctrinated to believe that republicans are nazis that makes them vote democrat.,Mediocre_Pea3919,2024-11-06T14:47:04,2
Arizona and Nevada are not blue states there swing states and have gone voted for Trump at the 2024 election. Whilst New Mexico and Colorado almost always go Blue whilst they surrounded by rural red republican America. Sure Texas may have some blue patches but these are largely in the big cities such as Austin Houston and Dallas while the overwhelming rural population votes Republican particularly now near the southern border. Texas despite the demographics change I don't think will go and vote for a democrat. So the question asked here is still revelant.,No_Wolverine_9249,2024-11-10T03:52:03,1

"College teaches critical thinking, which is necessary for many professional careers. Indoctrination is the blind acceptance of ideas without any sort of fact-checking.

"Factually speaking, there are patterns in partisan voting when looking at education levels. This isn't a political attack, it's just a fact, not a good thing or bad thing.  * The Republican Party now holds a 6 percentage point advantage over the Democratic Party (51% to 45%) among **voters who do not have a bachelor’s degree.** Voters who do not have a four-year degree make up a 60% majority of all registered voters. * By comparison, the Democratic Party has a 13-point advantage (55% vs. 42%) among those with a **bachelor’s degree or more** formal education.

"I would partially agree with this, but something else to think about is that people who go to university tend to leave religion. People who think they are smart tend to forget about God or believe that they are smarter than religion, which leads them to more progressive political beliefs.  Another thing to think about is that those with progressive beliefs tend to be more vocal about their beliefs and opinions while conservatives are quieter. Therefore when in university, it may seem that the majority are democrats because the majority of republicans don’t voice their opinions. This can lead those on the fence, or trying to fit in to their college community to side with progressive standpoints.",[deleted],2024-11-09T13:05:52,1

"Pretty obvious you never went to college, because you have no idea what you’re talking about. The point of an education is to broaden one’s mind, not narrow it. I assume you’ve never experienced it, but maybe you should sit in on a class or two so you can see what’s actually going on. Clearly one can be indoctrinated without a college education. I suggest you try experiencing reality and thinking for yourself, instead of repeating talking points you hear from your buddies.",GrapeTomato23,2024-11-22T09:11:37,1

"But college doesn't teach critical thinking.   It may offer it as a course, but that's not the same thing as inculcating critical thinking skills.  There is no correlation between a college education and the ability to think critically, in an open, honest way.  IMO, it's more likely to observe genuine critical thinking in a plumber or carpenter or other practical problem solver, than from a social sciences graduate.  The core of critical thinking is to *consider more than one point of view*.  This is very much an anti-pattern in many modern curricula, where much ""critical thinking"" is actually indoctrination and the required acceptance of dogma.  College education can instill groupthink, doctrinaire thinking, tribalism. There's a reward system in place for going along with the group, over contrary thinking.      **The results speak for themselves.**",WombleMagic,2024-11-11T19:28:00,1

Ofc conservatives tend to be more quiet and reserved and there opinions. But the writing on the wall universities overwhelming have strong diverse range progressive educated students. While I do believe free speech and independent thinking is necessary. Calling out hate speech racism sexism and bigotry is important. Universities tend to stick to the facts and not bogus conspiracy theories and wild extreme policies on the left or right to sort out many pressuring issues we are facing. It just happens to be the case that everything Republicans stand for is what young people are against such as Palestine owning your home cost of living welfare and healthcare benefits rent etc.,No_Wolverine_9249,2024-11-10T03:49:09,1

"If you can find me data that back your claims, I’d love to be proven wrong, but at this point it all seems like conjecture. The only data I can find is a correlation between educational attainment and susceptibility to conspiracy theories (inverse correlation). I suppose poorly educated individuals could have very good critical thinking skills, but lack the knowledge to properly vet sources, which leads to them being critical of, ironically, the correct information. This can be seen pretty plainly in the divide between college educated and non-college educated individuals on the efficacy of vaccines.  The key is not to just be contrarian, but rather to know when to be contrarian.",juniorstein,2024-11-12T00:39:06,1

"Can you find me unbiased data that shows, conclusively that college education improves critical thinking skills?  A lot of this is conjecture, yes. But these are political judgements.  Regarding vaccines, a different hypothesis is that college graduates are more likely to accept the word of authority figures.  Here in Australia, the most accepting group of people of \*both\* covid vaccination and severe government lockdowns were left-leaning university educated people.  Interestingly, its this cohort which also are most resistant to vaccinations in general. Many university educated people, particularly women, are very big in to woo-woo and ""alternative"" medicine.  So, clearly, ""critical thinking"" is not necessarilly a product of a university education.  But people who are university educated say it is...",WombleMagic,2024-11-12T01:41:56,1

"I’ll adjust my position then. I’ve looked up studies, and college doesn’t seem to neither help nor hurt critical thinking ability. Depending on degree, it does, however, teach you how to research; how to find information, vet sources, create and test hypotheses, etc. That’s an additional skillset that most high-school educated individuals lack. I’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who completely trusts ALL authority figures or experts. That said, trusting experts is a heuristic that is helpful, as experts are generally trustworthy (you can push on this point all you want, but society as a whole does lean on them for almost everything like medicine, and going to the moon, etc.). So college may not increase critical thinking ability per se, but it absolutely is not “indoctrination.” This is evident in that research is rooted in epistemology, so if your degree requires some level of researching, it requires you to be critical of your sources of information. So I’ll narrow my claim; college graduates whose degrees are in the sciences or other research-heavy domains, rather than technical, are more likely to be better at vetting sources, and hence less susceptible to conspiracy theories. As to your assertion that “many university educated people, particularly women” are into alternative medicine, that’s just based entirely on vibes.. I could not find any data on that whatsoever.  Also, here’s the [Study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248629/) it has a sample size of around 4,000 participants. The correlation between susceptibility to conspiracy theories and education is in the data. The authors are hypothesizing on what the mediator could be.",juniorstein,2024-11-12T09:35:32,1

"I could tell your comment was coming from more of an emotional place. There’s nothing wrong with going to college, just like there’s nothing wrong with not going, it’s a personal choice.

Of course, you don’t have to pursue knowledge at universities, but that tends to be where it’s done.",juniorstein,2024-11-12T00:44:32,1

"Really appreciate your thoughtful takes. I agree with what you’ve laid out here, but I also venture to say there is simply as much correlation as causation with education and political alignment in our country. Forgive me as I have only anecdotal evidence & what I would consider objective sociological viewpoints and also little to no concrete evidence nor research, but I think there is something to be said about those who, at some point in adolescence, find themselves on a likely trajectory to attend college and how it can shape one’s mental capacity to more align with right or left politics. It’s around what, age 10 or 11 now - maybe even earlier - that children are tested, gauged, and assigned college-likelihoodedness and subsequently are impacted on many levels that can really affect the personality developments that feed into eventual politics. As a classic example, children in lower-income areas with high potential for conventional college and so on success tend to have access to programs that not only differentiate them from their peers in a positive light but allow them more security and access to things like trusted adults, safe spaces, positive friendships, even things as essential as food security. This can allow these individuals the emotional capacity to develop a more altruistic nature, nuanced understandings of others’ experiences, and a sense for selflessness - whereas those sorts of ideals can seem like impossible luxuries to their peers with zero resources, a sense of academic abandonment due to a test score, and an entrapment in a survival mindset. I’m not calling to disagree with our existing methods necessarily, but I think we have found ourselves in a political landscape where the bipartisan is existing within and capitalizing upon an incredibly complex divide and it’s far too nuanced to really boil down to anything black and white, no pun intended.",shezapisces,2024-11-12T23:37:05,2
