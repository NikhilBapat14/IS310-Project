"Anyone here can look up 1930's German history and see it clear as day for what it was. So when folks here and on other places on the internet argue ""we are nowhere near that..."" tell them to go fuck themselves for not reviewing history.",williamgman,2025-04-26T10:43:33,223

"77m Americans voted for dictatorship in 2024, and another 90m rolled over and played dead.  Almost a third of eligible voters, 75m, stood up to oppose fascism.",VanceKelley,2025-04-26T13:35:01,40

"No one — especially in US politics — actually gives a damn about history. As long as they continue to amass fortunes, they won’t care at all how history views them.

"I’m not sure what that could do. The opposing party spent four years normalizing transgressions against law and order. If we’re lucky enough to get past this administration intact, the opposing party is still very likely to want to take the high road and seek normalcy. We’re beyond that now, on a structural level.   We have an entire generation of young adults that will have spent 14 years with this administration their norm. This won’t be fixed at a political level, and our education system will have been reframed to reinforce this.",Yellowpommelo,2025-04-26T11:01:48,7

Not enough people in America have the desire to give up their secure lifestyle NOR the courage to overcome the fear of retribution.  Plenty of people see the threat and everyone is waiting for someone else to do something.  It’s Bystander Effect on a massive scale.

What's even more frustrating is how the *same rightwing propagandists* who are downplaying this fascist bullshit had Republican voters *convinced* that our country was headed down that road under Obama (which we fucking weren't).,Yeeslander,2025-04-26T11:51:25,90
"It’s honestly asinine, these days I’m constantly reflecting on the education and lessons my teachers placed in front of me from elementary through highschool (93 millennial). We read “Night” by Ellie Weissel, Anne Franks Diary and COUNTLESS, other books about the holocaust. My peers grandparents (holocaust survivors) came in to speak to us about the horrors of fascism and the horrors that complacency breeds… The writing on the wall has never been more evident.  The only thing my teachers failed to prepare me for was soul-crushing disappointment that are leaders without a backbone.",Garbhunt3r,2025-04-26T11:56:57,28

Statements like this are weird. If you read this statement from the future it would sound like fascism has been abolished and democracy has won. Maybe this is a weird coping mechanism?  Maybe we should focus on fighting fascism (a fight we are losing) and then worry about what will be done after victory.,TheCommonGround1,2025-04-26T11:19:09,18

I commented this in the thread somewhere else but yeah the moment I realized the Democrats were truly cooked as a party was when Al Green got ejected during the State of the Union address and out of HUNDREDS of Democratic Congress members in attendance not a single one did anything.

"Maybe i'm just a cynic, but I think it may have been intentionally crying wolf all those years, partially to drum up support and make the republicans feel like victims, but also to desensitize them. that way when actual fascism came, their supporters would be fine with it, and then they could accuse the more liberal media of being sensationalist, because that's what they had been.",AugmentedDragon,2025-04-26T17:16:11,7

I’ve been thinking the same thing. These headlines and quotes all assume that we win against fascism while fascism has been steadily consolidating power and increasing its reach. It is more likely history will write about the cowards and traitors who tried to hold back the vision of the Great Donald Trump than that Donald Trump was evil.,Big_Preference706,2025-04-26T15:15:49,3

"That’s oversimplifying it. People aren’t just programmed in their youth and then continue to behave according to those instructions forever. Education is important, but culture and media are also important.   If we’re going to encourage people to support liberal and progressive causes, we need to meet people where they are, not where they would have been if they were educated exactly the way we wish they had been.  I think we need to face the fact that we’ve become a post-literate society. Much is made of the fact that a large percentage of American adults are incapable of reading at above a primary school level, but possibly more concerning is that most of the adults who are capable of reading at an adult level simply do not bother to do so.",ForgettableUsername,2025-04-26T18:28:12,5
