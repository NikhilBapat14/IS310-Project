Directly defying courts. Who made the decision to do that? Looks like it came straight from the top. Shocker,Major5013,2025-04-25T15:55:16,2391
">In an interview with Time published Friday, the president said he had not asked El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia—yet another reminder of the president’s complete disregard for the rule of law.  So he's flat-out admitting that he made zero effort to try to get Abrego Garcia back.  This goes against his whole argument that since Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador, there's nothing the US can do. It's like saying ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas.""  But the trump administration has changed their whole story, of course, because that's what they do. At first, Abrego Garcia's deportation was an error and there was nothing that can be done since he's in another country. Then the story changed to ""Abrego Garcia is a violent gang member, so we purposely sent him to prison in El Salvador."" And trump supporters don't care about the changing narrative. They'll believe all the narratives they are fed. If a new narrative about Abrego Garcia comes out tomorrow that contradicts the first two, they'll believe that too.",sachiprecious,2025-04-25T16:09:53,445

Yeah will be interesting what they do if he pardons them for civil contempt. Again SCOTUS said it's not reviewable so do they go back on that.,GotenRocko,2025-04-25T21:05:11,8

IIRC civil contempt was considered not pardonable because it's not a criminal conviction.  You are handed the keys to your own cell.  You hold yourself there.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-25T21:07:20,13

Also the Supreme Court decided that they get to decide for what actions Trump receives immunity. So they can decide that an order to defy the court is not within the duties of the office of the executive.,EterneX_II,2025-04-26T02:38:40,7

Hold them in civil contempt where he can't pardon.  Also you better start deputizing some Marshall's. He telegraphs pretty hard. So any reasonable person understands that he is going to try to capture the judiciary next. This is a shot at the scotus more than anything.,dankdeeds,2025-04-25T18:00:04,1
