"The rich will fly out of the country to seek the medication and terminate the pregnancy. The poor will suffer with their pregnancies and carry the fetus to term, struggling to pay for and feed the child. Causing undue burden on everyone involved including tax payers.

"Start calling it what it is. This is the Republican forced birth campaign. They're concerned population growth and birth rates are plummeting, and rather than address jobs/wages, costs (eg housing, healthcare, child care), the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, their only play is to go for forced births plus more broadly forced under education and impoverishment, to keep the labor force desperate and down from moving up the income ladder.",jarena009,2025-04-30T18:56:40,44

"The basic problem, besides the dubious quality of the data these guys are presenting (who are their control subjects??), is that pregnancy itself is risky.¬†   Sometimes you miscarry naturally and sometimes THAT leads to hemorrhage or sepsis. It's a risk when your body has trouble expelling the tissue after the pregnancy is no longer viable. This can also happen sometimes with a medication abortion. This is why we need it to be legal, so doctors can monitor and treat things if the medication doesn't completely work. If the patient is afraid to go to the doctor they are at MUCH higher risk. Overall the medications is still fairly safe, though it would be safer still to just not be pregnant in the first place.¬†   But¬† of course, if these anti abortion people were actually trying to protect women's lives, they wouldn't have outlawed treating women when their pregnancies are failing until the women are on deaths door, now would they?¬†",Sad_Pangolin7379,2025-04-30T21:34:45,8

"From reporter Alanna Vagianos:  Republicans and right-wing media have jumped on a new report published by a conservative think tank that claims the abortion drug mifepristone is harmful to women.

Did you read the article? It‚Äôs largely due to advancements in long term birth control and a blanket willingness to use the morning after pill. Both of which the GOP is trying to restrict access to.,Immediate_Werewolf99,2025-05-01T03:04:38,2
