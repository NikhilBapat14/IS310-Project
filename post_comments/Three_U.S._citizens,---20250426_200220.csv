"If I.C.E. went after the real illegal dangerous gang members there would be a different outcome. They would pull up in their unmarked black cars, with their mask on, and they would be shot to pieces. Instead, they pick on children, or people that are escaping the gangs in their own countries. They target schools, churches, and farms where a lot of people are just trying to survive, and make a better life for their families. They grabbed a wife of a National Guard at his base, and arrested her. I have heard that the officers of I.C.E. no longer have to have warrants to enter and search areas, homes, or businesses, that they have total power, and can detain, or arrest anyone they want. Its is like shoot first, and they will fix the paperwork later. How soon will it be before copycats dress up as I.C.E. agents to kidnap children off the streets, I think of this every time I hear an Amber Alert.",Fun-Reply-9905,2025-04-27T11:59:00,3

"I actually created an account to this rag paper to read the article. It appears the mothers were in the country illegally and were under deportation orders. The mothers decided to take their children with them, rather than leave them to the hands of immigration officials, which is totally understandable. Why would you want to leave your small child with ICE.  People keep saying there was no due process, this is NOT true. The mothers have been ordered to leave and there cases denied. Children do NOT get due process. Their parents make the decisions for them. The parents took these children with them.    The parents are not granted the right to stay in the country, just because the have kids in the US. That is the law. Now one could argue the merits of a child with medical issues, getting some compassionate grounds for the parent, but it's still the parents ultimate decision. Leave the child or take them with them. Would leaving them with ICE have been a better choice for these mothers? ",ComfortableAcadia252,2025-04-26T20:47:06,46

Most of the parents worked menial or farm jobs...they weren't here living any sort of ""American Dream,"" but it was still better than where they came from.

"I don't know the details of these particular cases, but the way it's happened for ever, under past administrations as well, is that if a US citizen is a minor child of parents subject to removal/deportation, the child will have to go with them when the parents are deported. Sometimes - if there's enough time - the parents may be able to legally arrange for a relative who is resident in the US to become the child's guardian and for the child to stay with them. But if there is no competent guardian appointed, or if, as is common, the parents insist on keeping their kids with them instead of leaving them behind in the US, there is no choice but to send the kid with the parents.   Unfortunately there is no provision in law to allow persons subject to removal to stay in the US just because they have a US citizen minor child, nor to separate the child against the wishes of the parents/guardians and keep them in the US (how? where?) while deporting the parents.   It's not just people who are here illegally, btw, it affects people on student and work visas who have to leave when their visas expire - they can't simply leave their children in the US  while they leave, nor can they insist on staying in the US until the child is older.",GrumpyOldSophon,2025-04-27T09:42:12,2

The fact that there needed to be a three fifths compromise is awful because the whole situation was awful - that being the fact that human beings were being held as property at all.

"It’s because Reddit wants to be pissed, but this isn’t really the case to lose your mind over.   These are the facts: The mother (and father) were here illegally. The 7 year old is not a citizen, the 2 year old is a citizen (born here) and no one reporting on it seems certain about the 4 year old.   The mother got picked up with the children. The mother was getting deported to Honduras.   Here’s where there’s uncertainty:  ICE claims that the mother was given the choice for the citizen child(ren), and chose to bring them back to Honduras with her rather than leave her with a guardian in the states while she is sent back home.   The father (was not picked up) claims that he tried to get ICE to give the children to his (legal) sister-in-law, but was told he’d have to formally sign over custody to her, and that he’d get picked up for deportation when he came in to do that.   From what I can tell, and I’m not certain on this, the mother wasn’t allowed to talk to the father while in detention, which explains some of the conflicting information.   The judge in the case originally asked to speak to the mother to clarify that it was her choice to bring the kids with her, but she had already been released in Honduras. The court date in May is set to do just that, check that the parent’s rights weren’t violated.  The mother is not in any prison or anything in Honduras, and the kids are living with her.   Honestly not the hill to die on, because if ICE can prove that the mother requested the kids to go back with her, which I strongly believe they can via some standardized form that they likely had her sign, this is going to look like a big nothing burger and we are going to look dumb for making a huge deal out of it.

If I was being deported I would probably want to keep my kid with him and not give him to other relatives to take care of her. The child is a US citizen so at any point they could come back to the US when they reach adult age (not sure what it is in Honduras but just assuming 18).  Are you saying the mother didn't want to keep the kid with her and wanted to give it away but wasn't allowed to? That isn't what happened based on the reports I read.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T08:19:20,2
"You are telling me a mother doesn't want to keep their child if they are having to move back to their home country?  I have a friend who deals with issues similar to this. He got devoiced and the mother went back to her home country with the child. They have had so many custody issues and it is a pain for him because he has to go to another country to visit his own child who was born in the US and is a US citizen. The mother was also in the US legally so she wasn't deported but still wanted to keep primary custody of it. So every 3-6 months he flies to another country to stay for 2-3 weeks so he can see his own child.  Maybe because I work for a very large background screening company but I know how to look up information on stuff like this, ICE isn't the gestapo but is just enforcing laws.

"As a fair warning, I am a pharmacist. I have had some basic trainings on childhood cancers and of what is required for treatment of various types of cancers but I am by no means an expert on them. However, I will do my best to try to explain why this could be a death sentence. Most cancers are inherently very fast moving diseases and can mutate and become resistant to different treatments. You would typically have a very detailed day by day plan for the treatment of the cancer base on tests done to confirm the type of cancer and the genetic markers that the cancer has. It might be a 28 day regimen where on day 1 you get an infusion, then day 2 through 13 you took an oral regimen, then day 14 another infusion, then an oral regimen, then another infusion for the 28 days. This can be highly toxic on the body (think nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, weakness, infections) depending on the chemo and requires quite a bit of recovery time. Then you might get a little break and then you repeat the entire process a few more times. This prescribed regime would all be based on genetic mutations that doctors have identified on your cancer cells doing work-up prior to the treatment. If down the line, this regimen didn’t do the trick or the cancer mutated, you would start this whole process over with a different regimen targeting different targets on the cancer cells. It’s a very detailed and thought out plan that requires pre-planning tests and monitoring tests along the way to ensure effective treatment. If that child is removed from his/her cancer doctor, they may miss important milestone of their treatment which could result in failure of the treatment, the cancer may be given the opportunity to mutate, and any doctor in that child’s new location will have no information to decide how to proceed with treatment. Assuming a four-year-old would not be able to make it back to the United States without their parents.

Legally the child was trafficked by the us government by allowing the mother to take them.   The other issue is that the child is NOT a citizen of Honduras. Due to this the child will not be eligible for any social services of Honduras. Not limited to, healthcare, schooling, emergency services, retirement or any others.   As horrible as separating a mother and child sounds. It is the best option for the child.   Now. Honduras does have by descent citizenship.

You are asking for the US to make exceptions to the law because the child has cancer. The reality is the child is most likely going to die in the US or in another country and it is the parents who created the problem not the US following US laws.

That is the problem in the US we have laws for so many things but they are getting ignored because no one is worried about getting caught breaking them.

The point is that they see it just as consequences for one's actions.

"How do you define a life? It is human DNA that is replicating and growing. From the time of conception to the time of death nothing really changes. The DNA is creating new cells. a fetus has been documented as responding to voices and music so even if you don't remember your time in the womb you are still very much a human and growing.  A 30 year old is just a mass of cells no different than a fetus.  A 30 year old can only survive in an environment the body is designed to be in. If you try to live under water you will die. If a fetus is removed from where the body is currently designed to live the womb it will die. No adult , child, or fetus of a human can live outside its natural environment.  I am not sure if you are aware of it but no 2 humans have identical DNA. Even Identical twins have different DNA and there is still a slight difference between them. All organs in a human being maintain their original DNA even during organ transplants. So if you get a heart transplant you now have another human's DNA in your body (I believe there was even one case where someone with an organ transplant died and when they did test they said a person who had already died had died a second time due to the organ transplant).  So the only real way from a biological standing to define a human is unique DNA. That fetus is not part of the woman's body and is a 100% a different human being from a biological standpoint.",Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T08:50:23,-6

I understand that and know people who died or have had cancer and cured it but without knowing the details on this case it is hard to say whether sending them home is really going to hurt them. I do understand many 3rd world countries don't have the medical infrastructure the US has. I am an odd case but I have very vivid memories of when I was less than 6 months old. I even have vague memories (although I can't confirm they are real) of just having being born and being in the hospital.  Ultimately it comes down to actions and consquences. They came to the US illegally and need to deal with the consequences of breaking the law. If we didn't have such a bad problem with no consequences for clear law breaking I would be fine with making exceptions for cases like this but it has gotten so out of hand we need to stop it for a while so people stop thinking they can just randomly come to the US illegally with no consequences.  When someone commits a crime and they get let off with no penalty they normally will just do it again. Crimes need to have punishment for them and when you take away the punishment you may as well get rid of the law.  How many people speed in the US every day? Tons because they know they aren't going to get pulled over for doing 10 over the speed limit (in some areas I have been if you are doing   less than 20 over you are becoming a traffic hazard). If they started pulling over every car doing 1 mile over the speed limit do you think people will keep doing it?

"David Geier—the guy selected to run RFK Jr.’s Health and Human Services bogus autism research—along with his father (who lost his medical license) did sketchy, unethical experiments on autistic kids. They’re antivaxxers and quacks, and had some extremely odd ideas regarding the nature and treatment of autism. Apparently one of these was that autism is caused by too much testosterone (sorry, autistic women and girls!), and so they gave autistic boys lupron, a sex-hormone suppressing drug usually used to delay precocious puberty, but also sometimes administered to sex offenders as chemical castration.   There was zero evidence to support any of this, and obviously those kids are still autistic.   Geier also has no educational background that would make him an appropriate choice to run a medical research study. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in a non-STEM field, if memory serves.   Further, if anyone is wondering what this is about, RFK Jr. has said that they will know the “cause of autism”by September of this year. Research doesn’t work that way. You can’t promise to deliver certainty about the origin of a complex disorder/neurotype at all, let alone in less than six months. Most studies take *years* from proposal to published results. What they are saying is physically impossible, unscientific, and unnecessary. Autism has been heavily researched for decades and is believed to be 80-90% genetic.   Most people in the autism and medical communities believe this is sham research intended to bolster RFK Jr.’s oft stated and long disproven opinion that autism is caused by childhood vaccines. He has made numerous demonizing, disparaging remarks about people with autism, essentially suggesting they are useless eaters—a concept the Nazis came up with—uncontributing dead weight in the New America. Never mind that 2/3 of autistic people have normal or above normal intelligence and many lead fully productive lives including paying taxes (Jr.’s primary concern)*.  The autism registry is also extremely questionable for reasons beyond the huge invasion of privacy (including data from Medicaid, private insurance, pharmacies, fitness tracker apps, smart watches etc.). The Nazi’s campaign of mass murder actually started with *a registry of disabled children* who were taken from their parents for promised expert treatment but were euthanized instead.   RFK Jr. is on record proposing that children who take psychiatric medications like ADHD med and antidepressants be sent to work camps, where they should be cut off from the outside world and cured with hard labor growing organic (!) produce. He racistly asserted that black children, whom he believes are being given drugs that “induce violence” as a “standard” practice, be sent to these camps to be “reparented” and “reared to live in a community.”  The whole thing is fascist AF and needs to be stopped. Even if this doesn’t affect (generic)you, they won’t stop with autistic people. Anyone they view as weak or unproductive or undesirable is going to be on the chopping block.   *Productivity under capitalism should not define a person’s humanity or value anyway, it should go without saying.   https://www.hassan.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/david_geier_letter.pdf  https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/health/autism-rfk-criticism/index.html  https://youtu.be/O5plmjNDU9o  https://youtu.be/2wBbj_zIstU  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/24/autism-rfk-jr-hhs-letters/  https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-plan-america-healthy-again-110006190.html",BrightBlueBauble,2025-04-27T16:59:39,1

"The child can't give consent though, can they?

What if they were moving or vacationing to another country and the child didn't want to go? Does the child get to override their parents and stay in the US? I don't think so.   I get that this is a horrible situation for the family, and I hope the child either has or can get citizenship and they don't get killed. I wouldn't wish what's happening to them on my worst enemy.

I agree that would be ideal but the problem is everything has gotten way out of control and sometimes you have to make it hurt for people to finally realize hey we shouldn't come to the US illegally anymore.  It is like speeding. How many people do 10 over the speed limit and don't think twice about it? Why do they do it? Because they know even if they go by 99% comes and they see them only doing 10 over no one is going to pull them over. It is time we start pulling over people who are breaking the law to be in the country.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T09:11:16,1
The mother was deported. The child was not deported but traveled with the mother who was being deported. No law broken in this because the child was not deported. I have a friend who is here illegally and he has been deported 2 times so far (one time was during obama) and keeps paying cartels to get back in the country. He has a wife and 3 kids who are legal US citizens. His mother and father have also gained legal US citizenship. I agree our immigration system is really screwed up so I do understand people coming here illegally but it needs to stop and they need to fix the system.  I wouldn't throw illegal guns in the ocean because as a big scuba diver I know how easy it would be to recover them. I have no problem with destroying illegal guns. I have tons of legal guns and if one of mine gets destroyed in the process I would be fine with it as long as the majority are illegal ones. I would willingly destroy one of my 20 guns if they could guarantee 10000 illegal ones were destroyed.  Trump has not deported a single US citizen. He did I think deport 1 who should not have been but they were not a citizen but someone who had poorly documented legal status to be here. There is a big difference between deporting a citizen and deporting someone with legal status. Legal status can be revoked for many reasons but citizenship cannot be revoked without the individual declaring they want to have it removed. A US citizen must pay US taxes even if they live in a foreign country the entire year but a person with legal status to live in the US but lives in a foreign country for the entire year would pay no US taxes. I say this as someone who has spent months living in foreign countries doing humanitarian aid work so I have some experience with how some of this works.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T09:20:46,1
I finished watching the film and your problem is no one is asking her to kill or not kill her kid. The kid isn't being hurt and she is just being asked whether she wants to go back to her home country with her child or if she wants to allow the child to stay with a relative.  That isn't the same as the gestapo saying go to another country with your child or put your child to death. They are saying you broke the law and must go back to your home country and it is your choice where the child goes with you to your home country or stays in the US since he is an american citizen but can't make the choice on their own yet.  I am strongly against abortion and feel the father's right to the child should require him to agree for an abortion but I don't think any abortion should be legal. If the mother's life is in danger I believe she should be able to choose to abort the child even if the father still wants it because it is a risk on her life not his. I feel bad for any woman who has to make that choice because do you kill the baby who they think gives you a 30% chance to die or do you take the risk and have to leave 1-2 other kids without a mother. That would be a terrible choice to make similar to that in the movie. Convince and making your life easier should never be a valid reason to get an abortion because you made the choice to have sex. Now rape is one category I am in the middle on because on one hand the child didn't have a choice in the matter and killing it seems like killing an innocent person but at the same time it wasn't the woman's choice that got her pregnant. Also as long as the father has no say in if the child is born or not he should never have to pay child support unless he signs a paper before the child is past the time it could be aborted. There is a legal case study about 2 lawyers in school who made an contract that if she got pregnant she would get an abortion but the contract was through out because the judge said once she got pregnant she changed her mind and wanted the kid and the father had to pay child support which I think is completely crazy that he had to pay child support after they legally signed a document saying she would get an abortion. If she wanted to keep it fine but he should not have had to pay child support since the entire point of the contract was they both were young in college and didn't have the money to raise it.  If you want to complain about due process your free to do that but we really need to hold news companies accountable for lying and saying a US citizen is being deported. There is no US citizen who has been deported since trump took office.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T12:25:21,2

"because this administration has already shown how clearly they follow the constitution.   but if you want a more realistic scenario they don't have to cancel or rig the elections like you think. The ground work is already being laid and it's basically straight from playbook.  A few days ago Trump ordered the justice department to begin investigating ActBlue the Democrat Party's primary fundraising apparatus. Considering how easy it is to put money into politics in the US I won't be surprised if they do find some legitimate shady money schemes (though conveniently ignoring all of Trump's own ways of accepting foreign bribes).     It comes out, probably only a few months before 2026 election that democrats have been taking Chinese donations (Trump's favorite boogeyman). All campaign funds are seized and all dems are accused of being Chinese agents. 99% of them could be innocent but it won't matter if the timing is right and mainstream media pushes the narrative on the masses. There are many arrests, especially, conveniently, in closely contested races and any remaining ""opposition"" party members must make an oath of loyalty in order to be allowed to remain in public service.   From then on out, just like in so many other dictatorships, the elections go forward as legally they must but it's always only one legitimate party with a chance and if any real opposition crops up the justice department swoops in to bog them down in legal entanglements and arrest their leadership on any reason they like.

"In the context of arguing with people who don't agree with you, I agree criticizing their word use wont be productive. People don't like to have their language policed and it just makes them defensive obscuring the larger point. When it comes to people you agree with it them using the right language in that context also can alienate friends for little gain. Where it matters is using the right language yourself when messaging to a broad audience (or to a lesser extent in an argument). It has a very significant effect especially if used consistently. Thats why fox, msnbc, daily mail, nyt, etc all have editors who push specific phrasing and word use. The right word can be the difference between a sympathetic or hostile first impression and peoples first impressions are usually the opinion they will maintain. An example.

When they talk about the state of Israel too they talk of it's ""right"" to exist. Countries don't have rights, people do.

There isn't a single nation that you can point to and say ""wow those cops are really great and everyone trusts and supports them"", we're just the only one that has people actually catching them and putting them on the internet for everyone to see lol. Meanwhile your nation sweeps these things under the rug.  just saying ""economics and trade"" is a vague, but I'm assuming you're talking about tariffs and the aggressive trade dealings that have happened so far, but like most of the stuff redditors complain about and spread propo about, its disingenuous nonsense. every nation on earth uses them effectively and negotiating better trade deals is just status quo things that every nation participates in and leftists have created a bunch of narratives about. and people in the rest of the world are obviously going to moan about it because it doesn't benefit them for the usa to fight for better deals lol. And anyone who actually understands anything about economics understands the basic principle of sacrificing short term gains for long term growth. If anyone understands economy its the nation that is newer than basically the entire world but still became the world's strongest economy and has the entire world hinging on its dollar.   I won't argue with you though that there's a lot of idiots in our country, but it's mostly the people that redditors support lol.",MatterofDoge,2025-04-27T14:09:06,-5

I am fine with current gun laws because assault rifles (military weapon with select fire that civilians can get a license to own but is very hard) are currently illegal to own in the US but an AR-15 (no select fire) is not an assault rifle.

"I disagree.  The instructor for my recent gun classes shared some personal anecdotal stories of people who used a castle doctrine defense and it cost them dearly.  He recommended having an attorney already on retainer if you are worried that you might have to do this, even if an actual criminal is clearly threatening your life.  The authorities are more than willing to create alternative scenarios in which you could have done something, or multiple things, differently and avoided it.  Now imagine that you interfered with an ICE operation.  Right now.  Today.  They arrested a *judge* for asking them to come back with an actual warrant instead of an administrative one.  They have threatened to arrest the bystanders who they are saying tried to further impede the arrest.  Now imagine that you are a woman or belong to a marginalized population.  A straight, white man *might* be able to get away with a ""stand your ground"" defense.  Maybe, if he shot an unarmed black youth, anyway.  But actually shooting an ICE officer?

Not really selective law enforcement. I am ok with people who clearly breaking the law not being allowed to drag out cases for years.  If you have video of someone murdering another person then I don't think they should be allowed to spend years trying to dispute the crime in courts when there is clear evidence of the crime. So I believe the law should always be enforced the same but our court systems and the delays are such a problem on clear criminal activity.   It isn't hard to determine if a person has legal documentation to be in the US or not and spending 6 months to a year going through it is just stupid so even if they have to look the other way I am fine with it in cases like that.  Once they get the problem under control then they can go back to giving every single illegal caught 6 months to a year to go through the courts.   When you have a bug infestation you don't just catch single bugs and verify it is the correct one you want to kill and kill them one by one you use faster methods like chemicals that can kill none target bugs as a side effect.  The real source of the problem is the government like sanctuary cities s not enforcing the laws and allowing people to break is. So we need to do a quick fix to get it under control that may hurt innocent people. Then once it is under control put in proper methods to control it and consequences for parts of government that refuse to follow the law.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T09:28:29,-1

So it is unconstitutional to deport people quickly but it is constitutional for areas of our government to refuse to report and deal with illegal activity? I know trump is pushing the line on what is legal and not but when he is trying to fight against other parts of the government not following the law I can make an exception for it.   If every single cop in the US was reporting people who they arrest who are here illegally which would allow the federal government to track and deport them then I think I would be against what trump is doing right now. The problem is they are saying we don't care if we found someone doing illegal things we aren't going to report it to you to prosecute you so that means the federal government has to use questionable practices to cover for other parts of the government breaking the law.

"What process is due in this case? I'm not asking what you think should be given, I'm asking what is legally required, because honestly part of the problem seems to be that the due process required for deportation is not well defined. This isn't a criminal case, so I know the due process isn't as strict as that.  When it comes to the children I don't believe they were illegally removed. The parents have the power to consent for the child and chose to take them with them. What is up for debate is if the parent's deportation was legal or not, and that I will leave up to the courts to decide. Part of the problem is all of this happens behind closed doors so it's hard to see exactly what goes on. I wouldn't be surprised if many immigrants just ask to be deported and get it over with, maybe because they don't know they can fight it, they think it's hopeless to fight it, or they are scared into it, who knows. I do agree at the very least they should be given the opportunity to contact a lawyer if they want to.   I'm not sticking up for law breakers. Illegal immigrants are breaking the law, and in some cases the people doing the deportation are probably breaking the law. You seem to be ignoring that the illegal immigrants are also breaking the law by being here, and instead put all your focus on the ones trying to punish with deportation.

Well if they can't provide legal proof they are legally here then due process is a waste of time and is a simple deport. That is good enough due process and nothing else is required. If there is issues with them proving they are here legally but are having trouble finding proof than sure give them a little due process to prove it and if they can't remove them.  The problem is we are letting them live here for years when they can't provide proof or any reason for them having proof.  I don't understand how obvious this is. I have been to 15 different countries and lived in some for 6 months at a time and you know I had this thing called a passport to prove while I was in the country. I worked with a person from Canada who had a Work Visa to prove he was here. There are other types of visas or you can get a green card etc. If you can't provide proof you are here you don't believe here and verifying the proof is all the due process they need.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T15:09:04,1

"First, pick a battle to fight. You're going off on multiple tangents at once more than I do, and I have a clinically diagnosed reason why I do.  And something that should be noted: we currently have a judicial branch at the moment that picks and chooses when to enforce the law. As far back as I can recall, the law has always stated that people entering the United States to become citizens have to be of legal age to make such a declaration, they must be sponsored, and from the moment they enter, maintain continuous residency and good moral character.  In other words: they have to be registered in the system and accounted for by the system, and they have to behave in accordance with state, federal, and local laws. They can not live here past any dates stated on their visa or work permits, and they have to leave if they can not adapt to our way of life. The judicial system can not interfere with the president carrying out the will of the people when the law clearly outlines that these people being shipped to El Salvador were in violation of several conditions of what I just outlined. Those orders were lawfully given, no matter what you think of Trump.   On a personal note, I do not think that military aged men with criminal convictions in their home countries for rape, murder, drug and human trafficking fit the definition of ""good moral character.""

"I am assuming you are talking about the part that says due process. The thing is it never says how long of due process the people need. Many of these people being exported are those who have been on record as needing to be deported for months. So they normally have a lot more due process than you think of just randomly walking up to an unknown person and sending them out of the country the next day. They are giving them due process but maybe making a few mistakes in the rush but until they find a person who was sent out wrongly. There may be 1 that was a mistake but remember we aren't sending them to jail so if he is really innocent the other country doesn't have a reason to pay to keep him and jail and could release him whenever they want so it makes you question what people are really shouting about because it would be easy for the country to send them back if they wanted to reevaluate the deportation.  Just remember many of the people being deported are not new people found but people who have been on the books as needed to be deported for 6 months but just have not been found yet. It is like all the media post saying US citizens were deported when not a single US citizen has been deported yet. There are more facts to the story people don't know or are not talking about.

Well the normal policy they have been following for years is the child can go with the parents back to their home country or the child can be given to another family member or anyone the parents want to give custody to and let them remain in the US.  If they cannot confirm the person being deported has custody normally the child will be put in some kind of other custody and there are different ways this is done. The parent then can be sent back without the child unless they can find a way to prove their custody.  This happens a lot more than you think because of child trafficking and also it is common for the children to come across illegally without the parents. Now in this case the child is a US citizen so there is birth certificate that can prove who the parents are.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-28T18:36:07,1

Like many things in the country there is no set standard for all things. There are current policies for how they handle things but that doesn't mean there is written down laws for everything. Laws are normally created after enough people complain about an issue or known previous issues not before.  It is very difficult to judge new things that have happened while they are happening but normally the best way is looking back and say last year we ran things a certain way looking at the results was it good or bad.  When they are testing a new drug they give it to a certain number of people and have a number of control groups than you compare after different periods of time if it is helpful or side effects is it causing.

Deportation in the US typically requires a hearing before an immigration judge. However, there are exceptions, such as expedited removal, where individuals can be deported without a full hearing, especially when apprehended near the border.   I guess you don't understanding what bending the law means.
