">Minister Mette Frederiksen said ""you cannot spy against an ally"" after a report that the U.S. is gathering more intelligence on Greenland  Of course you can spy on allies, it's just usually not a great use of resources.",thrawtes,2025-05-09T06:07:48,37
"Just spy/hack on the US and expose inner Trump secrets. Not hard anymore given they‚Äôve dismantled so many agencies, use unsecured apps, and put Drunkard in charge.",livelaughoral,2025-05-09T06:41:04,25
"Of course, Toolsie is more concerned this got leaked, rather than the fact we're spying on an ally.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-09T06:07:09,7

"Spying and intelligence gathering is the first part of any strategic invasion of another country.   The proposed invasion, which is not credible at the moment, would most likely be for natural resources and military base placement.",gentleoutson,2025-05-09T08:48:49,3
I wonder what kind of spying they are talking about. Greenland seems like a random place to be worried about espionage.,ModernnMuse,2025-05-09T06:05:38,3

Sewing misinformation and making backhand deals with politicians(bribing) is what intelligence services do. Especially spreading seeds for an invasion. Just look at Ukraine and Russia..   It makes complete sense for us to tell them to lowkey fuck off.,flipflapflupper,2025-05-09T06:16:43,16
