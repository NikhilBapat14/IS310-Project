It is profoundly sorrowful how far-reaching anti-Semitism has become. We aren't even 100 years out from one of the greatest horrors of history and we're right back around to this soul-sickness.,triggernaut,2025-05-08T20:39:06,297
"Kanye's bipolar nature and probably being antisemitic has really muddied the message, but the point he's trying to drive home via shock value is pretty interesting. He confirmed it within the past week or so.  He's arguing that liberals will defend it when gangster rap/drill rap contains hyperviolent lyrics about murder, rape, robbery, and drug dealing. Those lyrics are dismissed as ""just art"" and considered to have no cultural impact, and in fact, they'll even call you racist for saying those lyrics might have an impact on crime rate.  When he puts antisemitic lyrics in his song, it suddenly becomes ""normalizing hatred"" and a ""prelude to violence.""  It's a pretty interesting double-standard. Antisemites would say it's *specifically* because it's offensive to Jewish people, but he could have made a song like this about any other group the left considers a ""protected class"" and it would have had the same result.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-09T01:32:47,51

"Is he really doing that intentionally though? Maybe that's an unintended deduction you have concluded with. He's always had some true anti Semitic beliefs.   Sure he's doing it for attention and to rile people up, but I don't think it's deeper than that.",ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-05-09T19:26:59,3
He could have chosen any other ‚Äúprotected‚Äù class but he didn‚Äôt. He chose the Jews to attack. It was a decision he made carefully because he thought it would not create as much damage as attacking the other classes would.¬†,Blahblahnownow,2025-05-09T10:12:35,-4

"Pro-Israel Christians look to Israel - just now 77 years back in their land - as proof that God exists, proof that prophecy and promise are being fulfilled, and proof that the stage is being set for final things. While I agree with those points, it's also proof that Satan is real and his hatred for humanity is too. He hates what God loves, and he especially hates those God chose specifically. So he lies to those who he can use and convinces them to hate, to hurt.",triggernaut,2025-05-09T05:41:21,-23

"OK I could see him backtracking and using that as an excuse. It's a good one too since it makes sense. But he's always been a little antisemetic like saying the jews are out to get him, at first before he started making antisemetic remarks.   His followers were believing the jews own Hollywood thing and they control things media related and were trying to take him down. He wasn't doing that to show the ridiculousness of current rap and its explicit lyrics.   If he's showing the irony, it's just this one time. The other times he's truly anti Semitic and was doing it for attention.",ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-05-09T20:43:12,2

"You guys didn't disappoint. Almost thought I was in r/politics .   I myself often question how many of people posting here are actually conservatives. However, going forward, I'll have more empathy towards those people I questioned in the past.   Reddit overall is a cultist group think nightmare. For a while I thought conservatives were a tad better, and had more space for varieties of opinions. But it's all the same mess.  I've lived in super liberal areas, and people who are conservative, like myself, in these places have some spine and some resistance to groupthink. But overall, I guess conservatives really are no better than liberals.  (Good job pushing another one of your own away. Liberals have been ruining themselves that way. Why get left behind?)  I haven't heard a single song of Kanye West, to my knowledge, in my life. I do appreciate someone having the guts to say something that will trigger everyone. I may not agree with them, but I respect the quality of not caring about being liked by people like you.",languid_flower,2025-05-09T23:47:33,1
