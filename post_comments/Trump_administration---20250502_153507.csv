"Please, SCOTUS, don't bow down to Trump; a bunch of twenty year-olds should not be given access to powerful information that could be used against each and every one of us. ""So...it says here you donated to Planned Parenthood and PBS. Interesting.""",invalidpassword,2025-05-02T15:58:44,13

"From the NYT article about this: > Judge Hollander said the agency could provide members of the DOGE team “with access to redacted or anonymized data and records,” but only after they received training on privacy laws and policies, were subjected to background investigations and satisfied other requirements.  It’s infuriating and very telling that this administration thinks it’s unfair to redact sensitive personal data and require background checks and training on privacy laws.",mybustlinghedgerow,2025-05-02T23:34:42,1

"I say this as an American who loves his country and who didn't vote either time for this clown;  for things to change, it's going to have to hurt. He is going to have to fuck things up so terribly that only the most die hard right winger is going to support his platform in 26. So bad that even Senators are borderline afraid to not vote to impeach. The toddler has to throw his tantrum.  Until the majority of this country is affected enough by him and his cult's policies to give a shit nothing will change, and unfortunately, it's probably going to have to get very bad.",ashark1983,2025-05-02T16:04:56,5
