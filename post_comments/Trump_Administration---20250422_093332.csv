Why is Trump trying to kill so many Americans?  Is he trying to beat his record from his first term?,insuproble,2025-04-22T09:38:03,26

"You do everything that you can to stay healthy so that you won't be a burden on society as you get older, and your government comes along and yanks the rug from beneath you.   Republican politicians who support this sorry excuse for a President have less intelligence than pond scum.",Apprehensive-Cat330,2025-04-22T10:22:47,4
Not the important parts of the public.,Bumpredd,2025-04-22T09:54:31,1
It’s pretty obvious their goal is to kill old people and force births into wage slavery.  This is archaic and pure fucking evil.  It makes the most sense to me that republicans financed the development of covid to help push those goals.,Silly-Scene6524,2025-04-22T16:55:58,1
"Because with present and near development technology in AI and robotics, we are no longer necessary in large numbers to support the base of their pyramid.  The people behind the man think they are ""saving the world"" by getting rid of the ""parasite class"".   Just remember, they all kept selling the idea that we would be hitting a rough patch for awhile - ""but everything will be better once we get past it"".  That positive message about things getting better wasn't aimed towards us.",8anbys,2025-04-22T09:41:05,21

But they also don’t want population to decline ? That’s at odds with your theory. It’s more about social Darwinism than anything. They want the best to survive. But aren’t afraid to let a good chunk die or fail ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-22T09:43:33,8
AI and robotics are not anywhere near ready to replace the bulk of human labor. We are still in the prototype phase of all of it.,Fenix42,2025-04-22T10:31:44,3
"They don't want certain elements of the population to decline, you need strong breeding stock.   And the minute an outside aspect is controlling development, it's no longer anything resembling Darwinism, social or otherwise. It's eugenics, plain and simple.",8anbys,2025-04-22T09:46:01,4
"When they finally manage to rid themselves of their undesirables, they won't need to worry about bulk in regard to labor.  Farm based automation, industrial automation, self directed driving and flying resources are enough.   And that's just current public facing technologies - given the volume of shady DOD-billionaires throwing their chits into the pot, who knows what else would be in the mix.   You're right - it's not enough technological support to maintain a viable population as we think about it, but if you dig into the content these guys are jerking themselves off over we're talking about the ideal population for the US being like a couple hundred thousand.   People really need to start paying attention to how truly weird our most powerful people and their views are.  It's like ""bad guys from the Rainbow 6 book"" territory.",8anbys,2025-04-22T10:48:02,3
"I have been in tech in California since the 90s. I know exactly how weird these guys are. They are always wildly off base about how ready the technology is. ""Ship it and fix it in the update"" is fine for consumer stuff. It's not fine for the stuff you are talking about.  To use what is being called AI as an example, it's able to do things it has seen before. It can not generate truly new information. It offers no insights, just regurgitation. That is fine for things like boiler plate code or text. It fails hard as soon as you ask for a truly unique thing. Most of the things that need to be solved are in the unique catagory.",Fenix42,2025-04-22T11:27:44,4
"You're right - it's absolutely not ready.  I think interests behind this particular segment of political theater showed their hands too early, maybe they felt it was the last real chance they'd get. Now the masks are off and the people are getting increasingly enraged.   And I think that's why the cruelty is so hamfisted at this point - they want to beat down the masses before they unify against them. It's a ticking clock and they're hoping that American Apathy wins the match for them.",8anbys,2025-04-22T11:45:58,2
