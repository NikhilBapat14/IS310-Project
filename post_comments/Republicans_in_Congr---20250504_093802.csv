"And thus, cannot protect their seats. Vote them out!!!",Luckilygemini,2025-05-04T09:41:18,61
How did they find someone worse than Mitch McConnell? The Republicans really do have a talent for finding assholes to represent them.,vucubcame,2025-05-04T09:51:22,24
The coming Post Trump rebuilding era must involve the Judicial System trying cases of treason. At least they will get due process.,williamgman,2025-05-04T10:44:40,22
"Not really surprised tbh. They’ve been defending those tariffs for years now, even when it’s pretty clear they hurt regular people more than help. It’s just politics at this point.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-04T09:51:31,7
This Republican congress will not be remembered with fondness.  They are enabling an absolute imbecile to the detriment of their constituents.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-04T10:13:37,8
"Is there not a couple Republican congressmembers that have a heart or brain? I'm hoping a few have enough respect for the constitution, the people, or the law.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-04T12:21:32,3
Please acknowledge that Donald Trump is nothing without the GOP administratively covering his ass and keeping the system from sending him and his cohorts to prison,RobbyRock75,2025-05-04T12:23:00,2
The Republican Party owns the upcoming recession.,Ok-Tumbleweed960,2025-05-04T13:48:15,2
Reddit seemed to have removed the post about a resolution making it illegal to boycott Israeli companies. HR 867.  Completely removed.  A reminder to people that Reddit is not unedited.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-04T16:28:03,2
They’ve shown their character. Time to vote every last one of these scumbags out.,MidnightWorried6992,2025-05-05T08:15:32,2

Great. They can own what comes next.,alabasterskim,2025-05-04T17:00:29,1
"Be sure to remember this come the midterms. These people want us poorer, and they're just as much to blame as Trump. They only care about him and his agenda. To Republicans everyone else comes last.",DarthHiccups,2025-05-04T17:57:16,1

Never say never: I just found myself agreeing 100% with Rand Paul!,nogooduse,2025-05-04T19:49:19,1
Get rid of every single Trump enabler.,Intelligent-Travel-1,2025-05-04T16:51:30,13
2026 midterms better end with many of these Trump tariff defenders in Congress getting decimated in their re-election campaigns.,blueblurz94,2025-05-04T11:02:17,21
"Absolutely, mage sure every one of their constituents know they are supporting this.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-05-04T17:23:10,5
Hahaha like anything will happen. They’ve gerrymandered their districts so they have no fear of losing. That’s IF we’re even having elections by then. Not looking to hopeful on that front.,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T18:45:31,0
They represent their base.,IJustWantCoffeeMan,2025-05-04T14:36:21,9
Can't understand comments like this. It's like you are saying that the asshole politicians corrupted the people into voting for them. It's the opposite. The people wanted their politicians to be assholes and they got them.,Im_Talking,2025-05-04T16:12:57,3

"With little due process. I want the next president *running* on locking them up and throwing away the key. Court dates can come whenever the fuck we please, since that's how these fucks feel about the rest of us. If you're a sitting Republican or conservative judge/Justice, you are a target for invocation of the 14th amendment. You have led and given aid to an insurrectionist and deserve the punishments laid out in the constitution.",alabasterskim,2025-05-04T17:03:54,2
"Incels, meth and fentanyl heads, and Trump voters will be hurt the most ",Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-04T10:44:38,5
"Trump is in control of the RNC as well.. no reelection money or administrative help if you don't tow the line..   IN short.. think of the Donald as a really fat version of the Kingpin character from marvel comics, except 1/3rd as intelligent and no where near the acting ability of vincent dinofrio.",RobbyRock75,2025-05-04T12:24:46,3
"Probably. But they're all afraid of his wrath if they go against him and fail. Afraid he'll cut off any money for any re-election help if they betray him. But the thing is, by enabling Trump and protecting his policies, they still end up angering their own voters and will likely lose anyway.   They're all cowards.",DarthHiccups,2025-05-04T18:04:30,2
