Thanks Alaska for being sane.  Sanity is rare these days.  ,arilupe,2025-05-07T09:55:31,35
In future news... Alaska leaves the US and joins Canada as a territory. Geographically and politically... it makes sense.,williamgman,2025-05-07T09:58:55,11
"Words don’t mean shit when your actions are aggressive, threatening, and harmful to your neighbors.   Any overture from a state to the people of Canada is both pointless and insulting.   You’re that asshole aunt who’s all, ‘why don’t you just talk to your mom to keep the peace’ when last time you talked to your mom she slapped you in the face. in other words, when you send these bullshit messages, you’re acting in the role of the enabler.  If you have a problem then go talk to your ‘president’.",sylbug,2025-05-07T10:45:55,6
"Hey Alaskans, if you get hungry enough you can eat shit.  You voted for the hatred.  You don't like the cost.  Pay up, buttercup.",LawGroundbreaking221,2025-05-07T11:03:33,2

"Our leadership are absolute morons. They want this! They voted it in and cheered every decision! Even Murkowski confirmed everything!   The resolution is meaningless until they back it up with more than words. They and like half the state have been cheering this on the whole time.   We already have a COL that’s ridiculously high. People have been leaving the state more than entering it for like a decade running.  This is going to run what’s left into the ground. The MAGA morons brought this down on themselves, and unfortunately, on all the rest of us that live here too. ",ElectronicFerret,2025-05-07T13:44:52,0
Pretty sure every single state that borders Canada wants nothing to do with Trump's insanity on this. They all depend on their trade with Canada for large portions of their economy.,CrashB111,2025-05-07T10:00:21,20
The voted for this though.  This is what Alaska voted for.  I hope they have a great time paying $20 for a candy bar.,LawGroundbreaking221,2025-05-07T10:57:11,7
"They are a red state that voted for this. Like most Trump voters, they were duped into believing that the measures that they wanted for others wouldn’t apply to them as well. Why, oh why, would Canada want to dumb down their national IQ by taking them in? Maybe they could ask Russia instead. Heard they can see them across the water, on a clear day.",harveyhchrist,2025-05-07T12:10:32,4
"They were never part of Canada so they couldn't ""rejoin""",dbrenner,2025-05-07T10:16:47,3
Those future lucky SOBs....can they take us with them? California would be a nice Canadian territory I think. Just call us South B.C.,19chevycowboy74,2025-05-07T10:30:43,1
What makes you think we want them?  Eww,Sirius_Testicles,2025-05-07T10:08:10,-1
"In 2024, 54.5% of AK voters showed they are in fact behind the MAGA movement.",ktmfan,2025-05-07T11:19:11,0
And that goes double for Alaska because it's only land border is with Canada.  The towns that are nowhere near the coast are not going to be able to get goods from anywhere else.,Deinosoar,2025-05-07T10:23:15,10
Typo... meant join.,williamgman,2025-05-07T10:21:17,2
I'd settle with Baja Mexico at this point. Fish tacos.,williamgman,2025-05-07T13:03:18,1

Wait till they figure out Trump could care less about them now he's in.,williamgman,2025-05-07T10:23:20,2
They had a chance. In 2024. There may not be another chance if he makes good on his word.,ktmfan,2025-05-07T11:50:12,1
