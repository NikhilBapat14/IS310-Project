"More disappearing, this one in a Virginia courthouse. Three unidentified men, one in a balaclava, whisk away two men who appeared in court.    In addition to the civil rights violations for the two men taken, these abductions are going to have a terrible impact on immigrants in fear of simply existing in public, regardless of status. Kids will be pulled from school, people won’t seek medical care or social services, crimes will go unreported. So much suffering so these ghouls can appeal to the base, who love this thuggery porn.",me_jayne,2025-04-24T08:22:26,10

As is their intention with every out group they have beef with.  Abuse a few to terrify the rest into hiding or leaving.  State sanctioned terrorism.,Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-24T09:43:11,6
