"Right?  I couldn't sleep last night due to anxiety over a future medical bill because I had out-patient blood work done at a university hospital instead of the usual independent lab.  My doctor recommended it because she's trying to rule in/out a bleeding disorder, and in her experience the independent lab results are not reliable for one of the panels; she also wants to be able to review a blood smear herself.  The problem is, I cannot figure out ahead of time how much my out-of-pocket expense will be for this or anything really.  Despite me talking directly to the insurance carrier and the hospital billing department, I can never figure out how much anything is going to cost me.  I am so worried I'm going to owe thousands of dollars.  I really hate that this is the kind of stuff American citizens have to worry about, that and student loans and of course school shootings.",725Cali,2025-04-26T14:05:35,13
