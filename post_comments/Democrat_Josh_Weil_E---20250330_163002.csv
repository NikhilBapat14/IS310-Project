"He needs to get out to the retirement communities and address those folks directly. Get out to events that near retirement aged people attend. We need to bridge the chasm in the boomer and elder gen x age range to get the Republicans/MAGA ilk out of power. All dems need to spend 50% of their campaigns in deep red areas selling their ""what I can do to make your life better"" pitches to both sides. You cant forget your base but you need to find the compromises that appeal to the other side of the isle. ""Protect gun rights"" ""Protect social security"" ""support the border"" explain their plans in easily digestible but detailed ways. The left is fully capable of coming up with quality action plans that appeal to the majority of the US, even the deep red states. After seeing what tRump's lackies are doing to our country, putting every one in danger and gutting social programs that their base relies on is just an easy point of entry to pull them back to a more center right position over this far right BS.",ZeBigD23,2025-03-30T17:32:39,30

"Hoping beyond hope that Floridians will choose to vote. Special elections and mid-terms have hisrorically pretty low turnout.  I've been trying to spread the word however, and have provided links to Ballotpedia and their sample ballot.   Folks can provide their name and home address and literally see what/who is on their ballot, as well as when!!!!  It's an invaluable (and factual) site!!  https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup  (Again.... for the umpteenth time - but ya never know!)  Forgot to mention, though, it promopts  for an email address. If one prefers not too, it'll still provide exactly how ones ballot will read, dependent upon their location! It also provides the location where one may go vote.",Jakesma1999,2025-03-31T04:18:48,3

"If Josh wins, the Republican Party will literally shatter. A Democrat winning in a district Trump won by 30 points will make every remaining non-MAGA (or at least, MAGA-unenthused) Republican in the House and Senate realize that a Musk-financed primary challenger is the **least** of their real-world problems, because they could *literally* lose to a *Democrat*.  Republicans who decide to stand up to Trump and MAGA will instantly lose MAGA support, know they have no chance of winning the Republican Primary in 2026, and take their one remaining ""hail mary"" pass... switch parties (as new, proud ""Lincoln Democrats""), vote against almost everything Trump wants going forward, and hope they can quickly gain enough credibility to successfully assemble a new coalition of disillusioned former Republicans and pragmatic Democrats (who'll figure an incumbent Democrat who goes along with them 90% of the time is better than handing the election to a MAGA opponent who'll oppose them 100%) in time to win in 2026.  Regardless of ideology, the Republican House members who flip will take *so much hate* from MAGA, they'll be inclined to support bills that go *way* further to the left than they would have *ever contemplated* even a year or two ago, simply because they're going to hate MAGA with *burning passion*. It won't just be professional politics, it'll be *personal*.  More likely than not, the tsunami of Republican defections will include the entire Bush, Cheney, and McCain families... who'll go on TV to soberly admit that the Party of Lincoln & Reagan was murdered by Donald J. Trump.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-03-31T12:53:41,1

"Democrats plans are no longer believed by most in either party. As reclined as a really good job explaining why but ultimately, decades of promising things with an inability to actually get them done, and blue State governance sucking. That said, everybody knows somebody in a nursing home and some of the Trump cuts would result in hundreds od elder care facilities and hospitals being shut down.",TheStarterScreenplay,2025-03-30T19:36:06,2

"Looks at what's happening in Minnesota. I'd say Dem leadership there is doing pretty awesome work and actually following through on things. Also, if you look at Biden, like him or not, he managed to get a ton of work done to benefit the majority. Infrastructure, Chips and Science Act, helping many get student loan forgiveness, etc.. Definitely had a bunch of misses but we could spend all day talking about misses on both sides. So often the wins get taken for granted.",ZeBigD23,2025-03-30T19:52:31,8
"I get that.  But I also think democrats can reach people other ways, and should stop legitimizing the use of X.  In all reality, I highly doubt that many, if any, voters are going to see his post on X anyhow.  Let’s not forget that Musk controls the algorithms.

"I am a gun toting vet with a queer family, i put my life on the line for all, not just ones who look like me. Been a registered dem since before OIF when Obamas escalation orders meant I had a rocket launched at me. Had to sit there for a second that lasted a lifetime. At 20 hrs old I was staring at rocket getting launched directly at me while awaiting orders to engage. Still supported the man after even though that order probably endangered a lot of folks. I think it probably saved a lot of lives of non Americans because our soldiers could be incredibly unethical. Maybe that happens when you brainwash the youths to become killing machines.   I think this election finally broke me from the left. I would never support Trump or his movement.

"Listen to the Gavin Newsom conversation with Ezra Klein. Democrats are finished with the way Democrats have been governing for a whole bunch of reasons they will lay out for you.   Democratic governance sucks. And Joe Biden's administration will go down as the straw that broke the camels back.  A bunch of very conmpetent people legislating and governing like it was 2005.   I think it's time to stop talking about the chips act. Ezra Klein really good job talking about the broadband fuck up.   But again, it's Democrats who are  fed up with the way Democrats have been governing. A large part of it is the interconnected step process that attempts to do too many things and ultimately prevents anything from getting done.",TheStarterScreenplay,2025-03-30T20:07:47,-1

I can’t find any for the first either so I guess what I read was just fluff.
