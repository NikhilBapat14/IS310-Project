"A person cannot be legally charged with trespassing if they leave the property when requested to do so. The act of leaving the property immediately after being directed to do so by the occupier or a person authorized by the occupier is a key component of the definition of trespass.   Here's why: Trespass is defined as entering or remaining on property without permission or failing to leave when asked.  Leaving when directed to do so by the property owner or authorized person fulfills the requirement to no longer be on the property without permission.  Many jurisdictions, have laws that define trespass and outline the consequences of failing to leave when asked.   If a person does not have the right or authority to be on the property and fails to leave when asked, they could be charged with trespass.

"You're misapplying civilian trespass law to a federal facility. This isn't your local 7-Eleven. Entry without authorization into a restricted federal installation is a violation the moment it happens leaving when asked doesn't erase the crime. That’s like saying someone who breaks into a house isn’t guilty because they walked out when told. No, they still unlawfully entered.   Baraka entered a DHS-controlled facility without clearance. That alone meets the legal threshold. Walking out when told doesn’t undo the fact that he knowingly entered restricted federal property without permission.   You’re trying to apply state-level trespass logic to a federal situation, and they’re not the same. DHS doesn’t operate under your local mall’s rules. The moment he stepped past the point he was legally allowed to, he committed federal trespass. Leaving only prevented escalation, not the charge.",Tasty_Pie_1682,2025-05-09T20:09:07,3

"The Milgram experiment was based on real life. They were trying to replicate the psychological state of Nazi prison guards in a controlled environment.   >Before conducting the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage. Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock... Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim would refuse to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue, and they believed that ""only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board.""  Instead...  >The experiments unexpectedly found that a very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions, with every participant going up to 300 volts, and 65% going up to the full 450 volts. Milgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article ""The Perils of Obedience"", writing: ""The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous importance, but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations. I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist. Stark authority was pitted against the subjects' [participants'] strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and, with the subjects' [participants'] ears ringing with the screams of the victims, authority won more often than not. The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation. **Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process.** Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.""
