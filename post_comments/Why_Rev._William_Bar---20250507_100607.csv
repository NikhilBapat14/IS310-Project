"*The prophets say, Isaiah, chapter 10, “Woe unto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their right and make women and children prey.” Jesus said, when he started his ministry, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach good news to the poor.”*  *You notice that they \[MAGA\] never say that their agenda is a Jesus agenda. They don’t do that. You won’t ever hear them talking about Jesus and the least of these, they just can’t. And the reason is because their agenda has a Jesus problem and a biblical problem. It does not line up.*  Spot on, Reverend.",MentalTourniquet,2025-05-07T10:14:09,14
