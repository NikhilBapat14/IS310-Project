Sabotaging and slowing the mechanisms of the regime can be an effective contribution for many not up for a riot. It can be slowly ground down and these acts in concert with other strategies.  Pushing or providing the excuse for  Trump into making a declaration of a state of security emergency and martial law may be the step too far which finishes him.  If he sets the military against the citizenry under martial law it could perhaps spark a military coup.   Hegseth is certainly riling them and Trump could easily tip them over the edge.  Whether or not a military junta is prepared to hand back power to the people is however uncertain and history shows that they are often unwilling to cede control.  The only other option that I can envisage may be best referred to as 'traditional folk remedies. ',iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-29T10:27:12,2
"I seriously doubt that Trump and his cronies have thought through what martial law would mean, if implemented as a result of protests.  If there is one constant within the American psyche, it is that we don't like being told, ""No you can't do that."" Be it guns, booze, racism, etc. We have a full history of thumbing noses at people for this reason, good and bad.  Enacting martial law is going to see an upswing in violence against the state. It will not suppress protests, it will not protect the White House. Cracking down on protesters only works in areas where there is limited media coverage and the population is already cowed. In America? The country with the highest gun violence per capita? Killing protesters is a quick path to getting a civil war and Trump does not have enough cronies nor the intelligence to win it.",Nac_Lac,2025-04-29T10:48:02,2

America is really good at fizzling out certain protest movements. There’s not that kind of energy anymore because of how hard the public came down on resistance.

Exhibit A. “We are really in danger right now and we have to rally the grassroots to take back the destiny of America!”  Sorry, that was Al Gore, the former vice-president and environmentalist, speaking on a television talk show last weekend. “I think there may be a rising demand for another president in his late seventies,” he joked.  What about Exhibit B? “It’s time to fight everywhere and all at once… For far too long we’ve been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell us that America’s house is not on fire, even as the flames are licking their faces.”  That would be the billionaire governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, a scion of the Hyatt hotel chain.

"No. But peaceful protest is the only thing that can stop him now, especially since he’s overriding the judiciary and Republican Congress doesn’t care.   If he faces violent riots, he’ll use military force and EOs to quench the resistance with more violence.   But if millions flood the streets of Washington, peacefully, respectfully and not engaging in the BS that the police will throw at them - the military might not want to hurt American citizens who are peaceful.   The tiniest bit of violence will be deemed a riot by the media and the military. That’s one of the most dangerous situations to unfold for America.

Big difference between a protest and a riot,Be-skeptical,2025-04-29T10:22:29,2
"There is an entire landmass of space between rioting and suffering in silence.  Violence, even when justified, gives Trump's team the excuse of ""they started it"" (even if it was in defense, they can distribute footage that leaves out the inciting action).  Peaceful protest is way the hell more effective: yes, Trump's team might be stupid enough to authorize violence (Trump himself certainly is), but if they do, it's a lot harder to play the justification card with no video of protestor violence.  And there's a decent chance that at least someone on Trump's team knows this and recognizes that initiating is a terrible idea.  So don't riot, but don't suffer in silence either: show up to protest, and doing so peacefully will very likely keep you safe, but be sure to wear good running shoes just in case, and don't be afraid to leave early if you notice any signs that things might go downhill.",AB52169,2025-04-29T10:56:22,0

"The Democrats are in [a low-energy funk about their party’s future](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/gutless-democrats-paralysed-trump-3571629?ico=in-line_link). But organic, nationwide street protests against Trump have attracted hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. They have no obvious leader or uniform slogan.  The banners are homemade. For some, it’s “No More Tariffs”. For others, it’s “Real Americans Protect the Constitution”. Snatching people off the streets and locking them up in El Salvador has caused real anger. “Innocent Until Proven Guilty” is another rallying cry.  These protests have a 60s hippy-dippy feel. I was sitting in a quiet café when a young woman suddenly handed me a bracelet with a date on the beads and an exhortation to “be there”.  She dashed off before I had a chance to say, “For what?” Only later did I realise it was for an anti-Trump rally.  We could be in for a summer of rallies.

"But the galvanising energy of the 60s civil rights movement that re-emerged after George Floyd’s murder by a policeman in 2020 provoked an anti-woke backlash. Today Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, the last remaining symbol of the rallies that swept America, has [been painted over and erased](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-could-undo-everything-the-uk-learnt-from-black-lives-matter-3512731?srsltid=AfmBOoqiJQfLXfxm9m32r8Y7c8R_YoF8JCTtlPB_8cVHAmhAwsEstIL2&ico=in-line_link).  “We have bigger fish to fry than fights over what has been very important to us,” said Washington mayor Muriel Bowser. “But now our focus is on making sure our residents and our economy survives.”  There is no sign of Antifa, the movement that purportedly terrified the right during the first Trump presidency. Masked, black-clad anarchists became the go-to bogeyman for everything Maga disliked about the left.  Their presence at anti-Trump protests and vandalisation of liberal inner-city strongholds in Portland, Oregon and Seattle were a potent way to defuse criticism of white supremacists at the Unite the Right rally and the January 6 Capitol riot.  “Historically, dictatorship and authoritarianism can push people into violent action,” Mark Bray, the author of *Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook*, told [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/01/05/antifa-sees-trump-as-fascist/77183425007/). “That has happened in the past, and we are potentially moving into uncharted waters.”  But the Gaza protests on university campuses, arguably the heir to Antifa, have provoked massive retribution from Trump, using antisemitism as a spur to punishing Ivy League citadels like Columbia.     The 60s are often viewed through a nostalgic filter. They were marred by the assassination of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King, and ended in 1970 with the gunning down of anti-Vietnam protesters at Kent State university.  Richard Nixon won the 1968 election and the next 25 years were dominated by Republican presidents (with a brief Jimmy Carter interlude). But liberals embarked on their long march through US institutions.  That’s now threatened by Trump, who is coming after the courts, universities, NGOs and federal employees. The White House is itching for the revival of Antifa, which would give him the excuse to invoke emergency powers and deploy the US military.  According to Mark Esper, Trump’s former defence secretary, the President wanted to invoke the [1807 Insurrection Act](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/donald-trumps-republic-fear-no-one-safe-3584937?ico=in-line_link) in 2020 to set US troops on Black Lives Matter protesters in Washington, a prospect that horrified Esper and General Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  When Trump sought to stay in power after the 2020 election, former general Michael Flynn, a fervent supporter, took to the airwaves calling for martial law.  It is not too far-fetched to suggest that Trump would seize on future street clashes to suspend the electoral process and extend his term in power.
