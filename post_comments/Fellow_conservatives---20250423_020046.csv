"I don’t think I would say it’s about ‘conservatism’ (in the epistemological sense?) but [Verdict with Ted Cruz](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/verdict-with-ted-cruz/id1495601614) is by far my favorite conservative podcast on current events. Especially on judicial decisions he goes into an incredible level of detail and historical context. Whether you’re a fan of Ted or not, listen carefully to how he constructs his arguments and you’ll see exactly why he won multiple national debate championships. I even convinced a couple Democrat friends to listen for that very reason. The guy is brilliant.",zip117,2025-04-23T06:37:30,4
