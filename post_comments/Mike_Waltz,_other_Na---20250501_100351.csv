"Good. Who tf just mistakenly ""adds"" a journalist that somehow is on their contact list unwillingly? He reeks",kaguragamer,2025-05-01T10:28:49,430
Long overdue. One mistake was bad enough but this dude repeatedly shit the bed.,LemartesIX,2025-05-01T10:56:01,122

"Good, but since we are already here moving Wittkoff to any position that isn't related to foreign policy would be great, if we are removing incompetence it's better to do it properly. I am sure he is very good in real estate but not at all a viable option for such complicated diplomatic rounds.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-05-01T11:55:37,23

Are they offering up Waltz to see if that is enough to placate the growing chorus calling for Hegseth to get the chop?,FrenchAffair,2025-05-01T16:08:49,12

"Well, I guess inevitable.  However, I've been far less concerned about Waltz's actions relative to Hegseth's.  The reason you don't use something like Signal for discussing classified information is because it's possible to inadvertently add someone to a conversation who shouldn't be there.  Had Hegseth not shared what he did, this would be embarrassing, but nothing truly sensitive would have gotten out.  With the Pentagon IG looking into what he shared in the chats, it won't surprise me if Hegseth is gone soon, too.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-01T22:02:50,4
"Mike Waltz was Dick Cheneys counterterrorism advisor.  This was John Bolton levels of bad personnel choices, and like Bolton, I expect Waltz to go jump on CNN or write a book and get that payout.  Disgusting neocon traitor.",retnemmoc,2025-05-01T13:39:25,7
"Democrats didn’t call for Mike Waltz to resign, just Pete Hegseth.  The enemy just revealed who their operative was .. the one who wasn't called to resign.",vampirepomeranian,2025-05-01T10:47:35,-11

Do this and declare signal is safe and secure for TS and above communication and put this to bed.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-01T11:06:19,-28
"Even if he did by mistake, he's a National Security Advisor. You don't get to make mistakes like that and not have to pay the price.  These government/presidential staff phones should only have verified/need to know contacts on them and should be monitored at all times.",uponone,2025-05-01T11:23:56,175
"You got it, the one the neocons supported, not the one they were publicly going after.",vampirepomeranian,2025-05-01T10:57:15,24
Well it’s literally his fault. So yeah. It’s gonna be him.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-01T11:05:41,225
"Not really. I'm glad someone is being removed let's hope it's the right people and it doesn't happen again. But to be honest most people care about groceries, the border, crime, and their retirement. The average person doesn't really care about a reporter being included on a chat that shared basic information about an attack. Id rather see accountability than not though",fordr015,2025-05-01T10:16:22,-159
"He wasn't a moron, he was a neocon traitor trying to undermine Hegseth because he had a Iran War Boner.",retnemmoc,2025-05-01T13:42:18,4
He used to be Dick Cheney's counterterrorism advisor.  This guy was John Bolton levels of stupid pick.,retnemmoc,2025-05-01T13:44:10,11
"Nah, Witkoff is doing well, he has brains at least. Any person with much experience handling foreign policy at that level is going to be a swamp creature like Waltz (probably why you want one) anyways. Better to get someone fresh in there.",fleshdropcolorjeans,2025-05-01T12:52:36,-2

He's been nominated to be the ambassador to the UN.,ivylass,2025-05-01T20:04:18,3
Call me crazy but I care that the top DoD officials don’t leak classified info to random people. There are security protocols in place for a reason and they need to follow them.,DandierChip,2025-05-01T10:37:01,259
"Yeah, they get to not care because of the hard work of literally thousands and thousands of their fellow citizens..",spezeditedcomments,2025-05-01T10:18:28,41
"There was nothing classified in the information, reporters are given access to privileged information all the time. The story is this was unintentional but the info was not classified or something damaging to the mission.   Imo it was intentionally done to ""leak"" JD Vance criticism of the attack and find a way to justify it. The messaging would have been very different if the media got to set the narrative around the attack. I think they were intentionally vague.",fordr015,2025-05-01T10:51:34,-120
Defending the signal leak is such a strange hill to die on.,DandierChip,2025-05-01T11:28:21,182
"I'm not defending anything I'm stating a fact. There was factually nothing classified in the information and technically the person who determines what is classified In this case would be the Secretary of defense. Pete hegseth himself said that there was no classified information released, the majority of Americans don't really care about the issue and we are seemingly getting accountability anyway. Im all for accountability but we need to understand the facts of the situation before forming opinions.",fordr015,2025-05-01T11:34:29,-61
Attack plans against our enemies are most certainly classified and not public information. Use your brain dude Jesus.,DandierChip,2025-05-01T11:36:10,134
Attack plans would include locations and times. We did not know the specific locations it just says apartment building. There are a lot of apartment buildings. I'm not saying it's perfectly ok I'm saying there was not classified information. The secretary of defense confirmed nothing was classified as did the director of national intelligence. You are entitled to your opinions but they are nothing more than opinions. In every official capacity it has been confirmed that nothing classified was in those chats.,fordr015,2025-05-01T11:39:54,-17
