It just harder and harder to support the left when they really don't care about laws when they say they are more lawful than Conservatives. They sure as hell never prove it.,AdagioVast,2025-05-02T10:45:13,20
Imagine victim Brian Thompson's family seeing this glorification of his murder. Horrible.,triggernaut,2025-05-02T07:44:10,64
"Every single person in attendance will have blue, purple, red, or green hair, likely wearing makeup even if male, and will be tattooed with anti-Trump slogans, cheering on in giggling excitement during the whole production, like an 8 year old.   No one of any actual sense will be in attendance. The theater will barely break even if not lose money on the whole production, but will look the other way from that in defiance anyway.",ITrCool,2025-05-02T07:58:13,33

I’d sue the theater. For every dime they have. Bankrupt them.  Of course then they’ll just start a GoFundMe and grift leftists into restoring their funds because “save this theater and the critical need to have this production!!”,ITrCool,2025-05-02T07:59:22,51

"With what the ""arts"" have become over the last decade or two, I'm kinda thankful I don't understand them.   It boggles the mind that something like *Blazing Saddles* would be incredibly forbidden but things like *Comedian* (the duct taped banana) and *Piss Christ* are considered high art.",TheIncredibleHork,2025-05-02T09:11:42,4
