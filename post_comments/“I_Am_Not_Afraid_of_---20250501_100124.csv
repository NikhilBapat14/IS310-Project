This is exactly how everyone should be speaking. Mohsen has more courage than most of the cowards in Congress.,Jamira360,2025-05-01T10:02:56,71
">Columbia University student and Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi has been released on bail by a Vermont judge after more than two weeks in U.S. immigration custody. “I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” he told supporters as he left a Vermont courthouse. Despite being a legal permanent resident, Mahdawi was arrested by immigration enforcement last month at what he was told would be a citizenship interview, and accused by the State Department of posing a threat to national security over his pro-Palestine campus activism. We get an update from Shezza Abboushi Dallal, part of Mahdawi’s legal team, who says his release was facilitated by the prior blocking of his transfer to a jurisdiction more favorable to the Trump administration. Mahdawi will now be able to attend his graduation from Columbia University this month.",ZuP,2025-05-01T10:04:21,18
