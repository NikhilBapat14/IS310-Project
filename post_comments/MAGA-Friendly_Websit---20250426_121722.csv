"There is a significant crossover between lefty and right crunchy granola types and it's been like that since hippies decided to stop being hippies.

The problem is, these types of people are so damn stupid that they can't even see that their support of capitalism is in direct conflict with their crunchy granola lifestyle. Some of it boils down to Christian logic, how god talks about creating humans to look after the earth, and so some Christians really hang on to that little cherry of the cherry tree they like to pick from, but because it's woo woo logic, the stupidity it takes to believe in such things also prevents them from actually carrying out their task.",UntamedAnomaly,2025-04-27T19:00:33,1

When MAGA wins they have like a 5 seat majority in congress.  When the dems win they get a 40 + house seat and almost enough senators to defeat the filibuster.

also this just comes across as weak and diluted when you start carving out these exemptions. People should really focus on one target and hammer them to make an example similar to how the effective lobbyist groups do like AIPAC. AIPAC focuses on 1 or a handful of congress people and makes an example before moving on.
