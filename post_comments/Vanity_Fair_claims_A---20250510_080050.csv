"I have never seen a man that looked physically capable of defending themselves that didnt eat meat. I dont mean muscular or aggressive looking, I mean not noticeably pale, complete lack of any visible muscle mass, and usually extremely poor posture, among other visible deficiencies.

"I‚Äôm increasingly seeing that Vanity Fair is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation.¬†  They are basically just running a PR firm that masquerading as a legitimate media company / magazine.  Love to see some investigative reporting on the subject.  Besides, a more likely explanation for increased meat consumption by men is a reaction to falling testosterone levels across the board.  https://www.urologytimes.com/view/testosterone-levels-show-steady-decrease-among-young-us-men  Higher levels of zinc in red meat directly increase testosterone, and fresh fish does the same. Also, protein builds muscles and muscles themselves increase testosterone.  So, the far more likely explanation is nutritional deficiency and a biological drive to make up for something that is suppressing testosterone in men actively, and the biological drive we have to keep our bodies in balance.  Why explain through social theory and dumb takes what can be explained biologically. Occam‚Äôs razor et al.¬†",Blarghnog,2025-05-10T13:29:12,2
"So i wonder if stupid articles like this are part of some long term psy op to divide us however they can.   More protein is definitely a female thing too. Especially if older female, but lower carb higher protein is recommended more and more (based on redditors who discuss diet with their doctors.)  Plus the manosphere is a pretty reductive and bigoted way to refer to ....broad spectrum of news and entertainment  Finally, the fda/usda diet recommendations have failed the usa. These people are sharing what works for them",SerendipitySue,2025-05-10T14:00:15,2
