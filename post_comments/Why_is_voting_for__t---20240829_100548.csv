"Idealists want a perfect candidate / solution to the current problem.  Political parties come with baggage. World sized problems are rarely solved, they are at best managed.

"It's not mocked but the calculation looks like this:   * Vote blindly for a party that is the lesser of two evils.  Therefore the party will never shift their position because your vote is secure, but you've prevented the opposing party from winning. * Make the party earn your vote and don't give in unless they change their policy position.  Therefore you've managed to shift the party closer to your position but are risking the other party winning.     Both can be valid strategies and it really depends on what's at stake.",solid_reign,2024-08-29T15:38:26,18

"There is a very distinct difference between the 2 parties in this election. It is not a lesser of two evils. Take time to learn what each party stands for and make your own decision.   As far as the two party system, it has been debated for as long as I can remember and  nothing has come of it. The change that needs to be debated is the whether or not the electoral college is still relevant.   I fully understand that less populated areas disagree, but,  should we penalize a candidate that wins the cumulative vote count. These are all valid concerns. This appears to be much more relevant than bringing in a third party, based on previous results. So my question is, how do we resolve these issues in a civilized, meaningful manner.",CPfromFLA,2024-08-29T16:21:00,12

"Gonna preface this post with a big helping of ""this is my opinion"":  There's less a mockery for voting for the lesser of two evils and more ""we must make a candidate earn our vote"". If a Democratic candidate can run on the promise of ""not being Trump"", then what use is the vote? Biden may have accomplished a decent amount domestically, but his track record on foreign policy is downright right-wing and he even expanded a lot of Trump's border policies. He has also failed to use the tools available to him (like packing the courts, using executive order to codify Roe v Wade, etc) to protect against the obviously corrupt Supreme Court. Kamala Harris has not promised to be much better on foreign policy, and in fact, has some pretty extreme words to say with regards to American military in the DNC.  If the Democrats run on not being Trump, but continuously refuse to use their political toolset to protect those they are making promises to, and then people vote for them anyway, it shows that they can continue to be beholden to their lobbyists and donors while doing nothing to move on popular policy.   My suggestion, is that if you want to be politically engaged, you do so at a local level. Put your money, time, and effort in the people in your community and push your local elected officials to protect the people in your communities and hold federal officials to account. In terms of the weak political leverage the average American has, voting is among the weakest tools.",commanderbreakfast,2024-08-29T15:07:25,-1
"You're asking the wrong question.  By the condemning the habit of voting the lesser of two evils, the point is not that you should vote for the worse.  It is pointing out that it is a vicious cycle that needs to be stopped.  A vicious cycle means it repeats itself forever, so unless something breaks that cycle, you can accept your eternal doom.  For instance, poverty causes one to eat bad food. Bad food causes the person to get sick more. That means the poor person rather has a higher medical bill than the rich guy. The poor person spends the little they have on health, that makes them poorer. Then the cycle repeats. Poorer means worse food, worse food means more sickness. Whole thing repeats worse, then repeats worse again and again.  Same thing with being stuck on the vicious cycle of bad leadership. You're never going to get good leaders in that system because the system ensures you are always stuck competing with the worst.  A good person cannot come through because if a good person comes through and u try to go to them, the worst person will win while the less evil and good person both lose. So u stuck choosing among the worst.  Only way out is to exit that whole situation. [Change the whole approach or system itself](https://youtu.be/UeSEx7veNKI).",fletcher-g,2024-08-29T14:09:43,-2

A possibility but whenever a moment arises to actually put it forwards it's suddenly off the table  Want your union to be protected?

"But you left out the most important part of this choice - with option two, millions if not hundreds of millions of people could be much more negatively affected. Holding out for perfect at the expense of millions of people losing things like their bodily autonomy is *something that should matter* when making the decision. The privilege to ignore that is what infuriates other people. That you're just saying, ""I don't care if you for example lose your bodily autonomy; I need to send this party a message!""   I've seen the analogy that voting isn't like getting a car to drive directly to your destination; it's like getting on a bus or a train that gets you closer to your destination.

"Not sure about ""mocking"", but I have definitely seen many refusals to do it.  I guess it's about some kind of ideological purity on an issue where if you don't support what I want, then I'm not voting for anyone.  I suppose it's meant to punish a party you'd otherwise support for not electing the kind of candidate you want.  So if you agree with Democrats on everything except Israel support because you have family living in Gaza, you may decide to withhold your vote even though you know Trump will be worse in order to try to get the Dems to change their stance.  However, I suspect a lot of it is just that when their issue is not supported they become angry and feel more helpless and that it is unfair, and so when it comes to voting at this stage all they can do is withhold their vote.  I guess it's a kind of prisoner's dilemma situation where they choose the outcome worse for both of you to make sure that you also don't get what you want because they didn't get what they wanted, and feel it is unfair.",ptwonline,2024-08-29T16:11:50,6

">The party isn't going to change if you refuse to vote for them. The party can only change if they actually have the power to get into office and address the issues you want them to address.  This is a frankly absurd line of reasoning, and it's wrong, demonstrably by the election of 1912 when the Democratic Party, in order to take votes from the Republicans and Teddy Roosevelt, adopted many progressive positions and elevated progressive figures, particularly William Jennings Bryan who was arguably more progressive than Roosevelt. Despite not being in power since 1897, the Democratic Party of 1912 had made considerable changes.  Once in power the party has no incentive to change, infact, you have just incentivized that party to continue bad behaviors by demonstrating that they don't need to listen to concerns in order to get elected  It would be fair to say that the party can't EFFECT changes unless it's in power, but there is literally no reason why a party can't change it's positions or platform while not being in power, infact that's exactly what tends to cause political realignments",CivilWarfare,2024-08-29T20:28:37,6

The overwhelming majority of ppl my age (18-26) I interact with feel like ""well if such disproportionate violence is being funded under a dem, and aid paid for by our tax money was blocked from being received and covered up by our state department- how much worse could things get under a republican?"".  And this idea of ""What else are dems sweeping under the rug that maybe less easy to spot?""  I'm not sure if I 100% agree with that notion, but this past year has certainly created a lot of distrust in the dems and their messaging as the moral progressive party.   Additionally, without filibuster reform, the dems are unlikely to make any real headway on the most vital policy issues of this election cycle (codifying roe v wade, immigration, voting rights). It just makes all the urgent messaging utilized by dems seem less significant.   Again I'm not saying I fully agree but there is truth to this perspective. At the end of the day the president having the ability to appoint judges is the #1 why I will still be voting and I'd be very very pleased if they could drop the senate's silent filibuster.",AppropriateOne4122,2024-09-30T17:42:07,1

"I agree mostly, but if policy becomes law then it (potentially) sticks around for a long time.    A president with awful character does seem scary, but it only lasts a term.    I'd rather a bad president with good policy, then a good president with bad policy. But of course there's no either/or in real life.  Edit: When I say president, I really mean ""leader"" here. Example: I think both Obama and Bush (Jr) were fantastic leaders, but had a lot of terrible policies that are still around.  Bush really was a man of the people, and really handled the nation greatly during 9/11. And Obama was such a class and incedible speaker, and handled 2008 crisis very well. But they both did horrific warcimes and introduced horribly invasive policy into (Bush - Patriot act, Obama - second term riddled with broken promises and poor foreign policy)  A good, charasmatic leader can be dangerous because we forgive their bad policy because they are so likable.   Regan fell into this category because he also was a wonderful speaker and could captivatie an audience like no other, but his charasma gave his bad policies less attention.",spaghettibolegdeh,2024-08-30T19:53:28,1

It is still do or die we only have two real choices until it isn’t.”  I see so many people basically say caring about a future change is so in the future all talking about it does is degrade faith in our democratic institutions now- or people just want to jump their already - like “nothing can change unless we take the leap, vote third party today”.
