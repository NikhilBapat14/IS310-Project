"Epithets, like nicknames, need to resonate with someone in order to stick. As technically accurate as calling the MAGA movement and its acolytes “radical” might be, it doesn’t resonate with enough people. For those looking for a word, “regressive”  and “reactionary” fit better with the aims and reputation. For all the radical changes in method, the stated goal is still a return/regression to a mythical past.",Mrgoodtrips64,2025-05-04T18:03:07,47

"The far-right equivalent is reactionary.  The essential difference between right vs. left is appeal to heritage / tradition vs. appeal to change.    The far right wants to go backwards to some earlier golden era, while the far left wants to blow up institutions and destroy the existing power structure in order to transform to something new.    In that sense, the far right does not seek change per se, but a return to what they believe previously existed.  This mythos of the past may be almost entirely imaginary, but it is nonetheless rooted in a desire for some earlier construct.",I405CA,2025-05-04T17:59:09,36

"Respectfully, I think most of y'all are missing the point. Adjectives like ""radical,"" ""extreme,"" ""alt,"" ""fringe,"" ""far,"" etc. are used when there is a meaningful difference between the people they're describing and the mainstream of their ideological peers. It's fair to call Bernie Sanders ""far left"" or ""extreme left"" or what have you because his beliefs are demonstrably different from the American left-wing mainstream. And ten years ago, it was fair to call Trump ""far right,"" because he was an outsider, being contrasted against people like Bush and Kasich.  But nowadays, there isn't much of a gap between Trump and the mainstream beliefs of his party. We don't bother calling them the ""radical right"" because that term implies that there is another more common less radical kind of right. There isn't.

The right has made the word “radical” analogous with being what they call “woke” (educated in leftist terms) so it is simply a narrative at this point. The word is slung around mindlessly. We are living in a time where centrist views are now seen as being “left” because of how politically polarized we’ve become (e.g. supporting humanitarian causes is now considered liberal when it used to be a generally moderate view).

"The term ""radical"" is not inherently derogatory. It can be used in a derogatory way even if it's not definitionally derogatory, like the word ""Communist"" or ""Republican."" As you've stated in your post, radical (in this context) refers to a fundamental change in the very nature of the system rather than incremental improvements over time.  I would assume that you see the word ""radical"" in connection with leftist movements because leftist movements have regularly used this word themselves. Probably the biggest one that comes to mind is the radical feminism movement in the 1960s and 1970s. The International Workers of the World embraced the term, too. Plenty of others as well.  It's not really associated with the conservative movement in the US because the Constitution is fundamentally more amenable to more conservative policies. There really is no need for most Republicans to be radical about it.  Basically, if you don't like the kind of radical re-evaluation proposed by leftists, you'd likely use it as a derogatory term.

I'm sorry but the left wasn't always referred to as radical. They became radical when the far end of progressives started to enforce their world view on everybody.   Most Democrats are normal people who like most Republicans have normal lives and relationships. They understand nuance and how the majority of people actually are. The extremes though don't really understand this very well and if you aren't in sync with their extreme beliefs it becomes a problem.

"I would not frame the left-right political spectrum around an ideological desire for “change.”  Instead, the spectrum represents a model of egalitarianism.  The further left you go, the more your politics advocate things like decentralization of authority, cosmopolitanism, social equality & equity, restorative justice, labor rights, etc.  The further right you go, the more you reject the notion that all people hold equal moral worth.  Your politics values order over justice, rejects civil liberties and labor rights, and seeks to organize society into a rigid social hierarchy.  Take fascism as an example.  Fascist movements are categorically far-right and fundamentally both anti-liberal _and anti-conservative_.  Roger Griffin, a historian and scholar of fascism, defined it as ""a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism.”  Historian Ian Kershaw noted that the key distinction between fascism and other authoritarian governments during the Interwar Period was the latter sought “to conserve the existing social order,” whereas the former was “revolutionary.”  Historian Kevin Passmore noted, “Fascists are pushed towards conservatism by common hatred of socialism and feminism, but are prepared to override conservative interests – family, property, religion, the universities, the civil service – where the interests of the nation are considered to require it.”  Historian and fascist scholar Stanley G. Payne called out three main “negations” characteristic of a fascist ideology: Antiliberalism, Anticommunism, and Anticonservatism (though with the understanding that fascist groups were willing to undertake temporary alliances with other sectors, more commonly with the right).  We can look at plenty of historical examples, like Hitler’s alliance with Prussian conservatives, notably Franz von Papen, only to stab him in the back and neuter the political power of Prussian nobility.  I think the Trump Administration’s upending of our democratic institutions and attempt to extricate the US from its role as a world leader will, in time, serve as another example of the anticonservatism of fascism.",danappropriate,2025-05-04T19:56:48,9

"If ""neoliberal"" here is referring to Neoliberalism, the economic theory that gave us supply-side or ""trickle down"" economics, you're correct. Neoliberalism is embraced by both parties because it makes them all wealthy.   ""Progressive"" is a poorly-defined word, but for our purposes I'll take it to mean any policy where the government creates regulations or funding for programs aimed at sociological goals rather than economic ones. This includes eg. DEI, the ACA, even Social Security. And again, under this definition, I agree with you: pretty much any social policy proposed by a Democrat gets labeled as ""radical.""  The problem OP is alluding to is that the set phrase ""radical left"" is so pervasively used to talk about _Democrats and their policies_ that it mostly doesn't matter if a specific policy is social or economic. Either way, many voters will attach ""radical"" to the policy if it was proposed by a Democrat.   By way of example, the basis for the ACA was originally proposed by a Republican and it enjoyed bipartisan support; as soon as Obama introduced it at the federal level, it became ""Obamacare"" with ""death panels"" and all the other bullshit that came with broad Republican opposition. It became a ""radical leftist policy"" that was going to destroy American healthcare, force patients to wait for months or years to get critical surgeries, destroy the insurance industry (oh no... anyway), and make hospital emergency rooms look like Soviet-era bread lines. NVM that it was (iirc) Mit Romney who designed the system and got it passed in his state, first.  It's impossible for Democrats to propose anything without immediately losing the support of half of voters, who consider the d word to be synonymous with ""radical left"" and won't consider the merits of the policy or even the specific Democrat.

"_sigh_  Nowhere did I make an ethical argument about the good or bad of how various ideologies up and down the spectrum prioritize egalitarianism.  Saying that you'll find greater emphasis on things like cosmopolitanism the further you go left isn't an ethical statement, because there is no innate good or bad to cosmopolitanism.  Folks further to the left may view it as good, because _it is a means of achieving desired outcomes_.  Folks on the right may view the idea as impractical or incompatible with their world views.  Once again, my goal is to provide a model for the left-right spectrum rather than debate the merits of varying political persuasions.  This is about how one weighs the concept of egalitarianism within a broader political philosophy.  One might argue that a _more_ egalitarian approach is not necessarily good, because it ignores certain realities about how humans organize and cooperate—or _not_ cooperate.  Let's consider another example.  On the extreme left of the spectrum, you'll find anarchism.  The general idea is to abolish all systems of oppression.  Anarchist schools of thought abound, but the common threads include anti-statism, anti-capitalism, anti-private property, pro-voluntary free association, pro-self-organizing communities, and pro-individual liberty.  Anarchists may address some of the theoretical shortcomings of their ideology, but they argue that their absolutist position on egalitarianism creates a system where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  Even within the realm of the far left, anarchism finds its critics.  Detractors argue that self-organization is a skill that few possess, or the sustainability of complex infrastructure requires knowledge to be preserved within generational institutions.  Still, others will contend that anarchism is ultimately self-defeating and will eventually slide back into some form of statism or ""invisible hand"" minarchism.  What's interesting is, most of these people share similar goals with anarchists, like worker emancipation, but what they're saying is, ""we don't agree on the best way to get there.""  I did not ignore Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mao.  For one, I felt my explanation sufficiently addressed your point, and anything I would have added after that would have been moot.  Secondly, this isn't my first rodeo, and I know how that conversation quickly turns into a rabbit hole.  But, hey, if you want to go there, let's do it!  The conventional thinking is that Stalinism and Maoism equal Marxism, and Marxism is leftism, so, therefore, Stalinism and Maoism are leftism.  The problem is, this is all [based on conflations ingrained into Western thinking as a means of protecting the capitalist social order](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf).  It's flat wrong.  Let's go back to the beginning.  The ideology that undergirds what we commonly refer to as ""communist states"" emerged from Bolshevism in the 1920s into what is now known as ""Marxism-Leninism.""  After Lenin died in 1924, the Bolsheviks (mostly) coalesced around an autolysis of Stalin's interpretation of Leninism and Marxism.  Several aspects of Marxism-Leninism distinguished it from other Marxist schools of thought.  For starters, it advocates an isolated socialist country disconnected from any global movement.  Second, they relied on the ""two-stage"" theory, where underdeveloped nations first had to undergo a ""bourgeois revolution"" via rapid industrialization en route to a socialist ""proletarian revolution.""  Finally, ""vanguards,"" or class-conscious Party members, would lead society through its evolutionary journey while oppressing counterrevolutionary movements.  Both Maoism and Stalinism are derivatives of Marxism-Leninism.  From the perspective of a classical Marxist, Marxism-Leninism creates some issues.  First and foremost is the idea of a ""communist state;"" it's oxymoronic.  A communist society is definitively stateless.  Further critiques mostly center on how Marxism-Leninism attempts to synthesize a proletarian revolution.  The accelerationism of Marxist-Leninists conflicts with Marx's own historiography of human social development.  For example, Marx conjectured that society would only reach an ideal communist state after a millennium under socialism.  Revolution cannot be brought about by decree and replaced by dictators, state capitalism, and bureaucratic vanguards.  One wonders what's left of Marxism, or if it can even be considered as such.  It's questionable whether the ends of communism are achievable via the dictatorships of Marxism-Leftism, or if it's merely a Marxist cargo cult leveraging socialist populism to cloak right-wing authoritarian intentions.  I'm inclined to go with the latter.  If only because it's the thinnest of lines between historical fascist regimes and the praxis of Marxism-Leftism.  Hell, the Bolsheviks were rhetorically called ""red fascists"" by their contemporaries—even other Marxists/leftists.  So, are Marxist-Leninists like Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot ""leftists""?  Nope.  And for the record, _all_ authoritarianism is categorically right-wing.  Anytime you centralize authority or create political classes and social hierarchies, you're on the right side of the political spectrum.  As for ""civil libertarians,"" I'm not sure what you mean by that, but ""libertarianism"" certainly encompasses ideologies found on the left and right sides of the political spectrum...depending on...tada...positions on egalitarianism.  For example, on the right, you have the Murray Rothbard types who explicitly reject egalitarianism and advocate social Darwinism.  On the left, you have the Noam Chomsky, libertarian socialists who are anti-capitalist, reject private property, and promote mutual aid.  A source of endless fascination for me is the need for some to try to level the moral playing field of the ""left"" vs ""right"" by contorting reality into some preposterous horseshoe.  But I'll say it one more time for you: I made no ethical argument.  At no point did I suggest that one side has a moral high ground, because the concepts the spectrum represents have no innate ethical quality.  Obviously, you seemed to disagree.  That sounds like something you should reflect on.",danappropriate,2025-05-07T21:09:46,1

They are somewhat fluid.  >As an example: it's generally agreed that the terms left wing and right wing originated with the French revolution, with hardliners Republicans on the far left, and monarchists/pro-nobility on the right. And one of the core issues at hand was taxation. In the Ancien regime, nobility could levy taxes on their subjects through a confusing and complex system. One of these methods of taxation was the octroi, which is a system of tariffs on the internal movements of goods in France.  Left and right wing politics ascribed anachronistically to past regimes is not a very good idea. The post above outlines why in more depth.  At any rate, there's plenty of historians that would consider a lot of Stalin's policies to be right-wing in nature.  In modern politics - and in contemporary view - the extremes of left-wing and right-wing is different by definition. Someone who exhibits a range of ideals is going to fall in a spectrum between left and right; some ideals are rooted in the left and some ideals are rooted in the right. The idea of labour rights, civil liberties, and free social hierarchy is in this lense left-wing politics.  Stalin will have, according to this lense, exhibited both right- and left-wing policies; to start with, Marxism-Leninism is by nature authoritarian and seeks somewhat of a centralized control. This is, in a modern lense of the spectrum, a right-wing ideal.  I also would be loathe to describe Stalin as a ""Western politician"" when Soviet was the sole reason for West to grow into a cohesive unit, much through defense programs like NATO. In this way, the Soviet at the time was pretty much the anti-thesis of the West, and while Moscow geographically lies in Europe, it hasn't been part of European politics in the same was as European countries proper. So again, the original argument of mine applies; that perhaps if you refer to politicians from the Soviet, you can say that some policies are in relative to the US quite left-leaning, but these same policies would still not be left-leaning relative to European politics; not of the time, and especially not at this time.  Left and right in politics is a lot more complex than being two sides. Politicians may espouse right-wing politics but be traditionally left-wing, or vice versa; some political parties might support some ideals on the left side and some ideals on the right side. So it's very hard to call a person's political leaning in its entirety to be either left or right; however, you can focus on aspects within that person's political leaning, like say, labour rights... and say that this issue is traditionally part of left-wing political rhetoric. But even that is much up for debate according to who you ask. A lot of contemporary lenses of politics are very relative, which is why I am bringing up the point that left-right split in the end depends on what you compare it with. And in this way, my point still remains true that in EU, US left-wing politics is not actually close to EU left-wing politics; there's a relative greater difference in our political spectrums.",upfastcurier,2025-05-06T04:32:30,3

"Yes, left and right is a very problematic categorization because most people treat it as a single slider, when in fact it is a spectrum of many sliders. People can have both right- and left-wing ideals at the same time. Any extreme form of politics, be it on left or right side, might adopt political rhetoric that is opposite of their traditional base (i.e. extreme left turning to right wing policies or vice versa).  So, for example, using your own example: if left-wing policies are defined by their tolerance (which is an interesting lense of politics that I don't necessarily agree with but for brevity let's go with it), then it stands to reason that any intolerance that spawn is by definition not left-wing. Left-wing policies might lead up to the changes of policies, but these new policies are by definition something else.  This is further compounded by other political views; you mention anarchism, which is part of another interesting dynamic, namely order versus anarchy. On the far left, you have people who completely support a regime-free society with total freedom; which is more or less anarchy, or at the very least localized rules of law. But this isn't necessarily a trait of ""leftism"" intensifying; rather, this is the result of the dynamic between order-anarchism. Right-wing politics also has a divide in order-anarchism; you could argue that fascism seeks to abolish a lot of state-based laws and centralize power into the select few, essentially bypassing law as we know it.  These are not necessarily traits of either left or right policies, but rather additional kind of spectrums on top of the traditional left and right view of politics. So, in short, left-wing politics has a wide spectrum of different kind of policies and ideals, just like the right: so ""far left"" (which suggests there's only one group like this, beyond the 'regular' left, which is wrong) is just denoting that beyond having some left-wing policies it also has difference in other political spectrums like order-anarchy. There are also ""far left"" groups that support order, like those believing in heavy socialism; because this requires a robust regime and stable capacity of justice on a national level. These two groups - heavy socialism versus ""Antifa""-style - are both left-wing predominantly, but in different ways.  Basically, it's very redundant to talk about ""spectrum"" as having two opposite poles; rather, view it like a web, with many distinct variations of ""ends"" at either end. And yes, like you point out, groups may radically adopt policies from all over the place; and in fact, it doesn't just happen cross-over from left to right or vice versa, but also within the left or within the right. Plenty of political groups and actors for whatever reason adopts a political leaning like left or right but then make use of ideas that come from all over the spectrum; sometimes depending on popularity, and other times because they believe in it.  It's very simplistic to view politics like a simple line where you move from one end to the other.  In this way, the other user is not wrong that right-wing politics rejects things that left-wing politics adopts; they also wouldn't be wrong that left-wing politics rejects things that right-wing politics adopt. But more to the point, from the point lense of egalitarianism, which speaks of social inclusion and equality, the notion that the opposition rejects this idea is not inherently negative: it's simply fact.  For example, if I say I reject tyranny, then yes you can say that I view it negatively. But, if I say that people who value personal freedom rejects tyranny, I, the messenger, am no longer ascribing anything negative to tyranny; I am merely describing people who do. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that I am putting tyranny in a negative light merely for describing how some people react to it negatively.",upfastcurier,2025-05-06T04:47:11,1

"No, many far leftists are actually in favor of abolishing the police on the grounds that there are an inherently unjust organization devoted to protecting and serving the interests of the ruling class.   Many far leftists (like actual communists and anarchists) are also for the abolition of private property. Note that in this context (generally Marxist in nature) *private* property refers to things like factories, surplus value extracted from the labor of others, stuff like that. It is distinct from *personal* property like your home, your toothbrush, land used for personal cultivation, etc.",DeadlySpacePotatoes,2025-05-06T07:27:19,1

">You invented your own.  >[Left-wing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics) describes the range of political ideologies that support and seek to achieve social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy either as a whole[1][2][3][4] or of certain social hierarchies.[5] Left-wing politics typically involve a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished,[3] through radical means that change the nature of the society they are implemented in.  >[Right-wing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics) is the range of political ideologies that view certain social orders and hierarchies as inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable,[1][2][3] typically supporting this position based on natural law, economics, authority, property, religion, or tradition.

"> Stalin used left-wing arguments to justify his policies against homosexuality.  He saw homosexuality as a disease that hindered the path to a communist state.  That's neither true nor a ""left-wing argument.""  Stalin was a hardcore social conservative who promoted the nuclear family and increasing the population.  The aim was to get more people in factories and farms to fuel industrialization.  But that's not the only reason Stalin outlawed homosexuality in the Soviet Union.  There were conspiracy theories that homosexuality was secretly prevalent among Nazis, and homosexuals represented a fascist counterrevolution within the Soviet Union.  Therefore, their logic was that if you get rid of gay people, you get rid of fascists.  Yes, Stalin and his minions were _that_ paranoid.",danappropriate,2025-05-07T21:30:52,1

"Yes, I am well aware of the origins of left and right during the French Revolution. The moderates who wanted to keep the monarchy around in one form or another sat on the right side of the House of Commons, while the radicals who wanted to do away with the monarchy entirely sat on the left side. And over time these views expanded into what I said earlier.   Out of curiosity, how would you feel if I told you that [Lenin himself](https://libcom.org/discussion/lenin-acknowledging-intentional-implementation-state-capitalism-ussr) referred to the economic system he was setting up as state capitalism?   Also what the hell, I'll go back and respond to some other points you've made.   >Wikipedia isn't a source.  What about Brittanica?   >[left](https://www.britannica.com/topic/left), in politics, the portion of the political spectrum associated in general with egalitarianism and popular or state control of the major institutions of political and economic life. The term dates from the 1790s, when in the French revolutionary parliament the socialist representatives sat to the presiding officer’s left. Leftists tend to be hostile to the interests of traditional elites, including the wealthy and members of the aristocracy, and to favour the interests of the working class (see proletariat). They tend to regard social welfare as the most important goal of government. Socialism is the standard leftist ideology in most countries of the world; communism is a more radical leftist ideology.  Is Brittanica also not a valid source because it contradicts you?   >I realize that you dislike this because it breaks out of the one-wing-good / one-wing-bad dichotomy that is favored by ideologues on both sides.  How cute, you think you know my beliefs and mindset. But yeah, being a member of a marginalized group tends to make one pretty against outdated social hierarchies that treated them poorly.
