"Greer wasn't even told in advance about Trump's latest reversal on tariffs. Greer is supposed to be *in charge* of tariff policy. Clearly, he's not.  He can't do tariff negotiations any more, because he clearly  has no authority. Will he quit?",Animats,2025-04-10T07:31:50,30
Yep. You never get a clear answer out of them because they know they are lying. Have to keep it just ambiguous enough so they don't get nailed in court. They're all clearly coached by the Liar in Chief.,niceturnsignal81,2025-04-10T13:08:51,3

"Screw the what if‚Äôs. The market had a horrible day in August and people were calling for Bidens impeachment.   Trump gaslights everyone to say it is okay that the stock market is falling.  Seriously, everyone says he is untouchable, but demagogues always fall",vakr001,2025-04-10T20:24:03,1

"Yes, I know. Even after 2 impeachments, the J6 committee, etc...nothing happens to him. I meant that the comment should have been directed at Trump, not this poor bastard.   and yes, any little bit of truth that comes out of their mouths would be good for us, bad for the person who owns that mouth. Thanks for your comment.",Tasty-Hawk-2778,2025-04-11T09:26:18,3
