"This reminds me of what Armed Forces Network did with FOX News by the early 2000s, FOX News  was willing to provide their programming to AFN free of charge. AFN could put their anouncements  into the programs, not FOX News's ads. By the tme that they started carrying MSNBC, all of the good time slots were gone.. Even with the volume off and captions on, exposing people to the programs an hour and a half daily when they took their meals on post at the dining facility three times a day had to have had an effect.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-08T09:02:55,3

"Yeah this piece is behind a NYT paywall, but for iPhone users there’s an alternative. If you can’t see the full article below, you can access at least a portion of it in Safari Reader mode.   [Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/voice-of-america-one-america-news-coverage-kari-lake-1235334198/)  So this is Trump saying, “Screw you!

Yup.  American greed and hate has a voice now and it's all in their own image just like they want it.  ,arilupe,2025-05-08T08:44:57,4
I'm surprised it lasted this long honestly. I would've thought it'd become a propaganda channel months ago.,Mel_Melu,2025-05-08T08:56:18,2
Those are just American news stations. Trump is a criminal so they report his crimes - they are just doing journalism.,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-05-08T09:02:53,7

You mean the pro-reality news?,CockBrother,2025-05-08T09:03:56,7
"Also if Fox News and OAN are so legit - why don't they have a historical precedent. Where's the Fox of the 1960s or 1980s. It's hyper partisan news packaged up to be ""reality""",Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-05-08T13:03:09,1
