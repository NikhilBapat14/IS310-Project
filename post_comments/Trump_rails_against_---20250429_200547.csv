Why does a sitting President need to have rallies?,throwawaylol666666,2025-04-29T20:07:19,53
"Ignoring the absurdity of a sitting president having a rally 100 days into his term, here’s some additional context that’s fun for comparison.   - the average Trump rally has 5,000 attendees   - the last AOC/Bernie rally had 35,009 attendees",Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-29T20:17:47,21
You know even presidents who can legally run for another term don't start having rallies during the first year. Much less the first 100 days.,blackwolfdown,2025-04-29T20:09:45,19
"I take this as a very clear sign that they know they've forced the country into a shithole so deep that they can't figure out how to get out of it, so Trump is doing what Trump does; goes to the cult with red meat to rile them up and make them loud.  But I think he will have less minions to do this shouting because people will begin to notice that their money isn't going nearly as far, and there's going to be much less to buy.",2cigsaday,2025-04-29T20:24:42,5

Best way to know for certain that Biden genuinely won in 2020 is because this whiny little shit just can’t stop banging on about him.,ColdAdmirableSponge,2025-04-29T21:47:15,3
"You gotta be dumb af or really fucking racist (or both, probably), to go to this rally and *still* cheer this man on after all the damage he's done in just 3 months.   One thing I know for sure. Nobody in that audience has any dignity or self-respect left in them. It's a miracle these spineless, brain-rotted slugs managed to stand up straight and wave signs for an extended period of time.   ...we should have salted the perimeter.",NihilisticPollyanna,2025-04-29T20:54:21,6

The only Trump rally I am looking forward to is when Trump finally drops dead.,krisenfest,2025-04-29T20:47:51,2
"We went from the Gettysburg Address to the ""only the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" to ""ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"" to a spiteful, vengeful, narcissist who rants streams of nonsense, hate, and embitterment.  What will historians think of us and this era?",OhioValleyCat,2025-04-29T21:55:45,2
Reality itself is in a yuuuge conspiracy against him! Facts and science are plotting his downfall this very moment.,ceiffhikare,2025-04-29T23:09:25,2
"I didn't see an ounce of excitement over this here. All I heard was ""avoid the freeway"" cuz of it being shut down for his motor brigade lol ",kiramon53,2025-04-30T01:50:56,2

This isn’t new. He did it regularly during his first term too.,DarkenRevan,2025-04-29T20:19:05,8
The same reason he “needs” parades and sycophants as cabinet members.,backnarkle48,2025-04-29T20:49:16,6
These are his version of fire side chats from his teams perspective,CountOff,2025-04-29T22:29:00,1
I still do not understand how a dude that had such fucking low energy rallies ended up winning with the fucking numbers that he did.  Reality always presents a very different impression than the numbers do.,rolfraikou,2025-04-29T20:29:15,11
He’s not letting people have a moment’s peace. He is pathological.,borbor8,2025-04-29T20:30:20,13
"He couldn't even legally run for this current term, but he kept having rallies all through Biden's term, too.",PotaToss,2025-04-29T23:00:59,2
Correct my friend: Trump is a malignant narcissist at his pathology doesn’t allow him to self soothe connect to others or have any sort of self-esteem. He needs these rallies so he can feel powerful again so he can feel motivated to make himself feel better.,PastorNTraining,2025-04-29T20:30:07,13

"People thought the economy was good during his first term, and thought it was bad during Biden's term, and that's basically it.  These people didn't pay attention to the fact that his administration kept him from running with all of his stupidest impulses, and that 90% of his first term cabinet refused to endorse him.",PotaToss,2025-04-29T23:02:34,4
Because his numbers were not even enough to win. It would have been a recount.   Also Hillary beat him by a far greater popular vote count.   Both his wins have been electoral,Quiet-Type-,2025-04-30T01:48:17,2

"2024 he got 77,302,580 and she got 75,017,613. He won the popular vote. A dude who couldn't fill up any venues he visited, and had a poor turn out for his inauguration somehow won the popular vote.",rolfraikou,2025-04-30T01:52:29,1
