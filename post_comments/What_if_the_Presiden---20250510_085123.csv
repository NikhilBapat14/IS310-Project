"It doesn't make sense from an American perspective, or when assuming the US would take and keep these territories.  Try a Russian perspective.",Caraes_Naur,2025-05-10T09:15:30,18

"Try to annex 41 million pissed off Canadians. The amount of bodies we will stack will make Vietnam look like child's play and Iraq look like kindergarten. We will kill you! We will make your country hurt.   US will never be forgiven, ever, for entertaining this idea. We are not friends.",lcdr_hairyass,2025-05-10T09:48:35,14

"Resources.  At the end of the day, resources and lots of them. They'd also try and take Antartica if they could.  In order to hold those resources they need people. That's why they want to do away with Pro-Choice and force as many females (including both girls and women) to give birth as possible.  It's a numbers game. They need enough bodies to protect their resources.   It's not about making economic or geopolitical sense.  It's about war.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-10T12:51:46,1

"This is a really good article with lots of details. It explains why trump wants to take over other countries and why it's a bad idea. I would love for trump to read the part about why it's a bad idea, but it's not like he ever reads anything. ðŸ˜‚",sachiprecious,2025-05-10T09:18:03,1
"I disagree. As global warming speeds up, Canada and Greenland will have arable land, while land in the southern US will no longer be good for agriculture due to drought.  But even more important: The ice will clear and there will be a northwest passage from the atlantic to the pacific. The people behind Trump want to control shipping access there. They've already taken steps to control the Panama Canal. If they control both, they can charge whatever they want.",czndra67,2025-05-10T12:32:14,1

"The US was in Vietnam ~10 years and lost. They were in Afghanistan ~20 years and lost.  Canada is ~15 times the size of Afghanistan and ~30 times the size of Vietnam. We might be occupied for a time, but we would never be successfully annexed.  Never underestimate the tenacity of a people fighting for their freedom and their right to self-determination. Youâ€™d think Americans, *of all people*, would understand this, and not just from the wars they lost.  Has everyone forgotten how the US became a country instead of a disparate handful of colonies? So much for believing in freedom.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-10T12:18:13,1

Do you know why the Geneva convention was created?  Us. Because of Canadians. To put limits on what we were well known for doing to the enemy.,MongoIsAppalled,2025-05-10T10:11:29,1
"I spent a lot of time in Canada, probably 3 months out of the year from 2013-2019. Trumpâ€™s election in 2016 was interesting, and I saw the anger steadily grow for 4 years. I recall accidentally cutting off a truck in a parking lot, and they shouted out â€˜Youâ€™re lucky youâ€™re from a state with hockey.â€™ (I had Minnesota plates.) This was about as angry as it got back then, but this time around is entirely different. I understand the palpable anger that Trumpâ€™s actions are creating, it is completely justified, and it will take a long time to repair.   But I will say this is his playbookâ€¦ he wants division between our two nations. He wants Americans and Canadians threatening each other online, eroding the cooperative spirit that has been a hallmark of the relationship for a century. I think Canada has responded extremely well, the election was incredibly encouraging and the one silver lining I take out of this is that Trump has halted the slide into authoritarian politics that the rest of the West was experiencing. These assholes are a worldwide problem, and likeminded people need to stand against it and fight against the division they seek to sew.  And finally I have no doubt Canadians would respond brutally to any aggression. The nice ones get scary when provoked and I hope I never have to see it.",Chickabeeinthewind,2025-05-10T11:03:39,1
The one positive thing that I've seen come out of Trump's annexation threats is seeing how many staunch Republicans it has flipped. And I'm in a deep red southern state where bootlicking is almost as ingrained as college football.,kakamouth78,2025-05-10T11:51:10,1
