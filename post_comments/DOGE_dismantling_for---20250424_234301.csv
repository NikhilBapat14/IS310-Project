"Where the fk is Bush anyway? I know that former presidents usually stay out of things, but it's become so dire he really needs to step up. He was the head of the Republican Party.   Yes, yes, trump takes him out of the worst president spot, I get that.  But truly, there must be something he can do to energize former and current sane Republicans.   I'm beginning to think I was right all along. He was just a lame Frat Boy all this time. I want him to prove me wrong.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-25T10:20:02,1
"The [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/2673) that established the Millennium Challenge Corporation was supported by many conservative Republicans in its day! But that was in 2004, when the idea of Trump being anything beyond game show host was quite laughable.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-24T23:55:12,11
