76 years old.  Served 2-terms as gov since Maine has term limits.  Moved to Florida.  Ranks as one of the least popular governors in in history because he's a massive douchebag.  Decided to run again in 2021 and lost by 13%.  Moved back to Florida.   Now he's popping his head back up to run for governor of a state that he no longer lives in.  Does Maine like carpetbaggers?,Aggressive-Will-4500,2025-05-05T09:57:03,13

LePage was sort of the original Trump is governor form. He is a terrible human being.,AllynCrane,2025-05-05T10:24:40,7

"Being from Maine we saw a lot of what was coming with Trump based on how LePage ""governed"".  The old I am going to prove government is bad by becoming a political leader and trying to do the worst job possible.  This moran needs to stay in Florida where he belongs.",DrDrBender,2025-05-05T10:38:47,2

"I remember hearing this guy on a call in show when he was governor and he stated he was against legislation to distribute NARCAN because he felt NARCAN should be restricted by age like tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol.  He clearly did not understand and hadn’t bothered to try.",CowboyNeale,2025-05-05T13:29:45,1

LePage knows there is profit to be had with Trump in office.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-05T10:09:24,5
"No - Maine is basically a third D, third R, and third Independent.  We often had third party Independents running, and IIRC in both of his winning campaigns, there was a third party person and he won with less than 50 percent of the votes.  I think it was the second time that the 3rd party candidate dropped out right before election day and encouraged his voters to support LePage instead.  I believe there were accusations that he was paid to do so (I can't remember if there was any evidence of that, or if he dropped out due to legal issues that came out later).  Once we started Ranked Choice Voting, I think his chances at winning again in our state left.  LePage did say that he had that Trump behavior before Trump, and that he should charge for it, back in the day, but he also said things like black drug dealers come to Maine to sell drugs and impregnate our white women, that chemicals in our plastic was fine, as women would just get little beards/moustaches, and many other gems.",Fochlucan,2025-05-05T11:56:06,2
