"Branson said there could be a world “where Europe, Australia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, China … build a powerhouse in years to come. There is a big market out there, which you could find America gets excluded from.”  Exactly!  Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, exceeding those of Saudi Arabia.  Canada is third, followed by Iran.  Venezuela alone (303.3 billion barrels) has over **eight times** more oil than the US (36.0 billion barrels).  Canada (170.3 billion barrels) has **four times** more.  The US is a minor player.  This is a great opportunity for the EU, UK, and others (Canada, Australia, NZ, Latin America, maybe Turkey) to finally realize that the US is not needed for them to function. Together they have more people, more money and plenty of tech, military toys (including nukes) and natural resources – including much more oil - to work with each other - and leave the US outside looking in.  China can be a part of this. Let the MAGAs find out what relying on Russia is like. The US has been in decline for some time; MAGA stuff and moves like this are just a sort of official recognition of that fact. We are the latest second-rate nation on the world scene.  One of the great unintended ironies of all this is that MAGA, instead of making America great, are destroying what made American great in the first place, and in the process are rapidly pulling the US down toward the bottom of the pile.  We are becoming a second-rate nation with nukes. Like Russia.",nogooduse,2025-04-23T13:51:29,1
