"This year has kinda rattled my opinion on a lot of things.   I think the biggest thing that is a net gain masquerading as a net loss is the US threatening to pull out of NATO. And I'll give my reasoning why.  NATO standardized rounds: 5.56 & 7.62. in Afghanistan, if we ran out of our Canadian ammo, we could dip into a British tin or US tin and we're back to rock & roll. America is now designing a new service weapon that uses a round that's in the 6mm range, meaning if I was on a joint op with Marines, we have to truck in a third type of rounds and we can't share.  Strengthening self reliance: we're now seeing a resurgence in European weapons production. Options keep pricing honest, and it also makes for less compromising. Let's say the nation of Aquitaine became a nation again and they needed to source their own gear, they don't want a bullpup rifle so they get Canadian C7s, they don't want an F35 for they get Swedish SAAB, they want a widely fielded tank, they get the German Leopard. As these manufacturing counties grow demand, they develop more options, and they push innovation. This also functions to drive up the military spending percentage of higher GDP nations by offsetting the cost with export delivery.   Self reliance also moves further into developing support systems, you have to now be able to all of your own logistics, air support, sat surveillance, all of that stuff that we've kind of took for granted. If you called for air support in Afghanistan, it seemed more often than not, it was something American showing up.    Now for actual combat conflicts, we're fucking toothless, we're the old guy dreaming of ""back in the day"". Okay grandpa.  We (NATO) can't decide if we're the world police or not, and we end up screwing ourself either way. Half assing in Syria and Ukraine has caused massive refugee problems. We didn't have this after Yugoslavia. Either you're all in or you're all out. Call the bluff or fold with Russia. We let them bully us to a soft approach to Syria and now it's worse than it was and I imagine ISIS 2 will pop up soonish. Iran is kinda trying to do this by wrangling together a herd of half trained dogs on 30ft leashes, but I see a contiguous nation forming and actually holding this time.   We're letting Russia bully us over Ukraine even though they're at a stalemate with Ukraine using 20 year old left over, expiring, munitions and gear. Russia is a paper tiger that we know is a paper tiger at this point, but we're still acting like it's a real tiger.  China will do what China thinks is in China's best interest and they can because the CCP runs the show. If they need to take an economic ass whooping, they'll handle it way better than our slap back. Do I think they can win against NATO if they invaded Taiwan and we declared war over it, depends on your definition of ""win"". We roll the clocks back to 6mo ago, no trade war and hurt feelings, what's the game plan, everything will have to be sailed in for the invasion. That's what they want us to do. We don't have a Kuwait to stage in, they're not Afghanistan that we can bomb them and then set up an air bridge. War in China would be impossible, defense of Hong Kong 2.0. US Navy would be useful, but Chinese navy is made for the South China Sea, we're playing in their pond at that point.  Push to this week and is NATO going to follow the US to China  if they invaded Taiwan? That's not article 5, same as Iraq wasn't article 5. EU is worries about Russia, they're not going to peel resources away from continental defense, that would be like Columbia knowing Brazil wants to attack but still sending its troops to Africa because idk I'm just making an example (no offense Columbia or Brazil).  I think I gave you enough to chew on for one meal.",Lin093,2025-04-07T01:24:38,6
"We need to completely reform US policy.[ Here's my proposal so that the President no longer decides foreign policy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17GGzn3Ic2T5QH2oGekRmcMvFPrbkAmCFCh3aHN38gaU/edit?usp=sharing), and why it would benefit us.",illegalmorality,2025-04-09T00:34:47,2
"> but we're still acting like it's a real tiger.  It's the nukes.  I seem to vaguely recall that Putin threatened to pop one if NATO sent any actual troops into it (semi-official advisors aside).  Then there was the chatter that he was considering bringing tactical nukes into it; Biden publicly said ""don't do it, man.""",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-07T03:06:30,1
