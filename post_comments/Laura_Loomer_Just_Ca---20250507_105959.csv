So the short story: Those MAGA members in Congress want to cut benefits to their constituents... But are concerned they might vote them out. But they still want to cut Medicaid to them regardless. Yet these dumbasses still vote for them only because they have an R in front of the name.,williamgman,2025-05-07T11:09:13,40
I can’t wait for Republicans to really start killing off their constituents with their policies. I’m sure it will still all be Biden’s fault.,Tricky-Efficiency709,2025-05-07T11:09:52,25
">Medicaid is “critical to the heartland voters who propelled Donald Trump to his election victories,” she wrote, before warning that cuts could hit “Americans the hardest in rural red states like Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, where Trump’s base depends on the Medicaid program for survival.”   Laura Loomer is the voice of reason? What the fuck is happening??",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-07T11:38:35,18
"It's surreal this is coming from an influencer (human trash at that) not elected representatives who, you know, are supposed to care about their constituents.  Medicaid is pretty bad but a lot of people depend on it. It was all I had for a couple years. The ACA is really great. Of course the GOP hate all of this. Elected officials should have to use the public healthcare system so they can understand what it's like.",co-wurker,2025-05-07T11:26:05,7

"Typical of cultists to ignore actual policies and just adore the personality, until it's impossible to ignore how detrimental the policies are for them or someone they love.  Then, all of a sudden, GASP! they discover the man behind the screen.",SwvellyBents,2025-05-07T20:58:11,2

You shouldn't wish this on any constituent—regardless of how they voted—and encourage you to seek some help on why you do.,Excellent-Notice2928,2025-05-07T11:18:28,-42
She doesn’t give a shit about Medicaid.   She cares only about the consequences of the GOP cutting benefits to their constituents: lost elections.,Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-07T11:52:17,12
Loomer doesn’t really care about the health impacts on the constituents. She only cares about the impact on the Republicans hold on power.,skypilo,2025-05-07T11:28:32,7

"You probably shouldn’t tell people how to feel or what to think. If you want to keep quiet and play nice while other people’s shitty choices have real life consequences negatively affecting your life, that’s your choice.

Because these morons voted to destroy our countries future because they can't take five seconds to read something outside their right wing sphere and are largely driven by bigotry.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-07T12:07:03,6

"I know that, but she's also correct in identifying that people rely on Medicaid to stay alive;  that there exists a poor population that needs it, that they aren't all malingerers and frauds.  That's a revolutionary position for a member of the Trump party.",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-07T12:01:11,6
That's a pretty functional system -- they should be afraid of not serving their constituents. She likes winning more than she likes killing.,30mil,2025-05-07T12:21:48,3
I don't really give a shit if she gives a shit or not. I don't care what the motivations are for doing the right thing. Who cares.,LocalStatistician538,2025-05-07T13:09:48,3
You can't control others. You can only control you. Square up why you wish harm on others. That line of judgment is no better than those you claim to be above.,Excellent-Notice2928,2025-05-07T12:19:25,-20
I don't advocate for keeping quiet.   I do advocate for not wishing harm on citizens—like it or not we share this place with them and need to reach accord.  The legislators and businesses conning those citizens? Fair game.,Excellent-Notice2928,2025-05-07T12:45:43,-15
"I don't know why people on Reddit act like it's a problem that the Republicans are ""only doing it so they don't lose their seat."" Yes, this is the backstop of democracy, why democracy WORKS at all. Because even the most heinous asshole who is an elected official has to wonder whether they can keep their seat. That's it. That's the bar for a functioning democracy. It's ugly and pitiful and doesn't say much about human beings in general. But I'll take it! I'll take self-centered narcissists in politics doing the right thing (for their constituents) for bad reasons (self-interest only).",LocalStatistician538,2025-05-07T13:11:49,4
Indeed.,Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-07T12:01:47,1
Sure. I’m just pointing out it’s not some altruistic position she’s taking; it’s simply about power and control.,Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-07T12:23:34,2
You need to look up exactly what fascism is. Judges are being arrested without warrants. Fox News Yes men are leading alphabet agencies. I’m not sure how familiar you are with history. But it’s repeating itself right now. Wake up.,Tricky-Efficiency709,2025-05-08T05:24:25,1

"I don't care at all what the motivations are. Why did Murkowski, Susan ""I have concerns"" Collins and John McCain save the ACA? I don't care WHY. I just care that they DID.",LocalStatistician538,2025-05-07T13:12:39,3
I'm well aware of what's happening—thanks. Nothing about it makes me want to celebrate the deaths or harm of citizens.    Those responsible for the disinformation that brought their policies and positions forward? Yes. But not citizens.    This (should) be a place of political discourse. Not a therapy space for teeth gnashing and thinly guised threats of retribution. Leave that nonsense to Fox News' comment section.,Excellent-Notice2928,2025-05-09T14:43:40,1
"Well there certainly should have been some made before the election, don't you think?   Would have saved us all a lot of trouble.   Elections aren't won by the minority. Subsequently: tyrants aren't ousted without populist support. Do the math, act accordingly. ",Excellent-Notice2928,2025-05-09T14:45:30,1
"I get your point.   I’d just rebut that, in my view, McCain saved the ACA, while Susan and Lisa did their typical performative bullshit.   I believe that so strongly because senate leadership of the GOP never would have given *both* Collins and Murkowski the green light if they weren’t already convinced McCain either was a yes, or wasn’t going to make it to the vote.   It’s neither here nor there, of course.",Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-07T13:36:48,1
