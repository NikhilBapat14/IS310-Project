India stopped buying oil from Iran around 2019. It has now diversified imports from South America and certain African countries. I believe South Korea also stopped or at least significantly reduced imports from Iran.,Potential-Lack-5185,2025-05-01T13:44:27,3

"I'm always surprised when Trump tries to strong arm countries like Iran. Does he not realize autocracies don't care for this shit. Like they don't care if their citizens starve because of sanctions. This approach is never going to yield Trump results with countries like Iran. This works for allies who are stable and dependable, hate Trump's bullshit but still need the USA and it's patronage so like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Countries with mild and friendly foreign policies who nevertheless need USA's support for a variety of reasons and have a common adversary. And most importantly actually give a fuck about their citizens and their country's economies. And have elections etc.",Potential-Lack-5185,2025-05-01T14:14:11,4
This isn't US law.  It's international law and the US can be sanctioned for violating it.,DiarrheaMonkey-,2025-05-01T14:46:01,4
"There is no such thing as international 'law' in the way that a country has laws. There might be a 'court' like the ICC, WTO  but they only have jurisdiction when a country agrees to be bound by its decisions and even then their enforcement capability is limited if a particular country says they don't care about a decision in particular. If I get ruled against as a private citizen in almost all countries and I tell a court to fuck off, eventually the cops will either take me to jail until I comply or order third parties to take my stuff and give it to the court or order a third party to act as if I did ask the third party to do something on my behalf. There is absolutely nothing like that in international law. Netenyahu has had an arrest warrant for a while from the ICC but none of the countries that are signatories to the ICC have arrested him when he's been in their country. What has happened? Nothing.",I_love_all_boobies,2025-05-01T14:57:11,-1
"It wouldn't come in the form of imposing rules and hoping the US would follow them.  It would come in the form of other member nations being given leeway in penalizing the US in trade practices.  it's not like the ICC.  There are ICC member nations in which Netanyahu could conceivably be arrested *if he sets foot on their soil*.  That's what happened to Pinochet; he was arrested in Spain.  Wealthy and politically influential Israeli citizens effectively guarantee Netanyahu's safety abroad, though arguably not everywhere.  But my point was economic sanctions for violating WTO agreements.",DiarrheaMonkey-,2025-05-01T15:18:28,3
