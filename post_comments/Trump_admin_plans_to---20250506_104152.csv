"That's not true.  While there may be some examples of cutting corners to meet requirements, for the most part meeting the requirements means doing things that would contribute to longevity.  Here are some examples:  * Improving the insulation on things like refrigerators results in less compressor wear.   * Variable speed motors reduce wear and produce less heat. * Variable speed compressors reduce wear, heat and produce more consistent cycles. * Transition to solid-state controls resulting in smarter (and thus less) usage. * Environment sensitive dimming reduces burn on televisions * Use of LED lights, which last longer and produce significantly less heat. * Better auto-off and standby modes result in less use/burn.  These are just some of the things.  You said in another comment ""parts have to get lighter to get more efficient"".  That's not necessarily true, but lighter isn't necessarily less strong/reliable, and using more energy to move something heavier tends to have a negative impact on longevity.

As much as I did reference a surplus casually, I did not ask who the last president was that got it. You might as well tell me the last president that wore a tutu, and it would have been just as relevant.",SweetBearCub,2025-05-06T16:42:16,0
Funny I have an energy star top loader earlier this year.    Almost as though you don't know what your talking about. The problem is the fact companies will always choose to maximize profits over anything else.,pax284,2025-05-06T12:26:55,12
"I did, but I don't see what the confusion is here. You correctly pointed out where the phrase ""clean coal"" comes from and that altogether it is about as ""clean"" as other fossil fuels. And of course that any reliance on it is increasingly more misguided as renewables become more and more accessible and efficient.  But my point was largely that the term ""clean coal"" is an intentional misnomer used to manipulate people into thinking that it is something it isnt. It's not just that Trump is an idiot and used the term, it's that the term itself is insidious and an intentional misrepresentation.",jfudge,2025-05-06T17:29:47,2
"It’s especially true for anthracite I think, but yeah all fossil fuel is inherently limited and if we don’t get off it then our future generations won’t ever have it if they need it.",Otherdeadbody,2025-05-06T19:14:53,1
You seemed to be unaware that federal budgets have been balanced before.,darkenthedoorway,2025-05-06T20:27:46,1
"So you just casually ignored when I called out the bullshit studies from the coal industry that that popularized the term, and ignored the quotations I used when mentioning it to show that I don't personally support the term. You're not saying anything that I didn't already represent in my first comment, I just wrote it with the assumption that the people reading it would have enough reading comprehension to not need it spelled out in such an obvious fashion.",LightOfTheElessar,2025-05-06T18:15:20,2
"What are we even arguing about here? It's pretty evident we don't disagree at all on the substance of this, we just have a different opinion on how clear you were on a particular point in your original comment. If I thought you made the point as well as you think you did, I probably wouldn't have responded to it?   Maybe this is a good point to agree to disagree and move on.",jfudge,2025-05-06T18:57:32,1
