"Who could have predicted that electing a senile, sociopathic imbecile President of the United States of America could have a downside? You know, like destroying the world's strongest economy in a mere 100 days?",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T09:02:25,6

"In Feb the Atlanta Fed predicted first quarter GDP of +2.9%.  Then Trump started talking about the tariffs  and within a couple of weeks the Fed predicted NEGATIVE first quarter GDP.  What happened?  Consumer confidence plunged.  Fearing a recession consumers cut their spending.  About 3/4 of the GDP is based on consumer spending.  The latest forecast from the Atlanta Fed estimates the second quarter GDP will be -2.7%  We are headed to a major recession, it is all on Trump.  Trump's Great Recession is going to be very bad..",Haulingsworth,2025-04-30T09:24:46,3

I can't believe markets reacted to Trump promising to enact blanket tariffs across the board without having a basic clue about how they work...,tenebre,2025-04-30T09:06:29,1
It’s trumps failure,Aretirednurse,2025-04-30T09:44:12,1
And remember this is the economy before the tariffs actually had any impact. Just the talk of them.  Wait till we see the damage next quarter when they actually start to factor in.,Deinosoar,2025-04-30T09:09:33,5
The fact that you hear that in Canada shows that the media is complicit. It would take them 5 minutes to find the article that they wrote in 2017 when Trump was touting the record stock market and saying that he did that. That MAGA was underway. I’m sure it’s on xshitter as well.   If the 1st 100 days in the 1st term he wanted to take credit for the economy and benefits of the economy then he has to own this economy. Especially considering Biden was able to hand him over the presidency when the stock market was at a new all time high.   The ridiculous part is the stock market isn’t the economy and Trump was speaking about the poor performance of the market when he said that. The economy shrunk because tariffs and more.,Morepastor,2025-04-30T09:28:22,3
Of course he will.  He pulled the same shit during his first term.  Anything good is because of HIM and anything negative is always someone else's fault.,metalkhaos,2025-04-30T09:49:18,1
It happens from time to time. It is not that uncommon to have a single quarter with some losses.  But we are certainly going to have more than one quarter this time.,Deinosoar,2025-04-30T09:10:09,1
