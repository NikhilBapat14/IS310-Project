"Awesome! Need more of this!  Stop letting companies get away with slave labor. Punishing the people using illegal immigrant labor is just as important as securing the border itself.   When no one wants to hire them, it will reduce the number of crossings.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-01T09:49:58,348
"Needs to me more than just a fine.  Their business license needs to be pulled.  this isn't an instance of ""they gave us documents that reasonably appeared to be genuine"".  Make an example out of them.",pimanac,2025-05-01T13:54:46,65

The managers who hired them need to go to jail too.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-01T12:35:49,16
"Don't automatically yank their business license, put them on probation and give them a chance to clean their act up. But the fines should be increased to 2X of whatever it would cost to hire a legal worker for one year for each illegal that was hired. If the business reoffends then pull their license.    Give them a carrot with one hand, but hold a stick in the other.",ureallygonnaskthat,2025-05-01T20:33:37,16
