The most corrupt administration the world has ever seen.,Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-04-24T22:59:30,4
" > Within weeks of beginning his second term, Trump flouted many of those decades-old protections – including by firing more than a dozen inspectors general and dismissing the head of the government’s ethics watchdog. He also signed an order making it easier for lobbyists to join agencies overseeing industries they used to represent.  > CNN analyzed dozens of financial disclosures and ethics statements filed by presidential appointees to track the wealth and potential conflicts of interest among Trump’s Cabinet members. The disclosures offer a limited picture of nominees’ finances: Officials are only required to list their assets in broad ranges.  > Still, Trump’s leadership team appears to eclipse the wealth of any previous Cabinet going back decades. Of 21 Cabinet members, seven reported holding at least $10 million in assets, and some are even billionaires.  It was so cringe in the past year hear so many voters say they’re voted/ing for Trump because they “want to see somebody tare the system down”",Oleg101,2025-04-24T23:01:09,2

"Good grief people, wake TF up.   Our glorious dictator is the puppet that's dismantling the fabric of our democracy and the social contract.   Once he's done, MAGA is toast and JD vance steps in to complete the job of paving the way for Networked States.   We the people have lost. The adversaries of democracy have been planning this since Reagan. For as long as justass Clarence Thomas had been a bump on a stump, doing nothing until they got a majority on the SC.   The Establishment knows it's a lost cause. Comply or be ruined is the message being sent to campuses to Media outlets ...   And DNC thinks pushing right will get them back in government, finding conservative middle ground, wishful thinkers that they are.  Or outright collaborators.   meanwhile, everyone turns their back on the genocide happening before our eyes. Can't upset our fascist ally; who's got the dirt on everyone and who's minders see they tow the line.",Electric_Banana_6969,2025-04-24T23:18:47,0
