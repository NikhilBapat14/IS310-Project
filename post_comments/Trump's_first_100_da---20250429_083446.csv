He’s losing all the groups that helped him get into office and it took him less than 100 days. Incredible,jediporcupine,2025-04-29T08:41:19,24

40% of Latino voters have their heads up their ass.,nwgdad,2025-04-29T08:52:43,15
"I don’t understand why the legacy media keep repeating that Trump won Latino men when more precise polls which actually take into account the diversity of the Latino population show that Harris won Latino men. By a smaller margin, but she did. https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unidosus_2024americanelectoratevoterpoll_hispanicvoterdeck.pdf  I suppose that a lot of Latino Trump voters are the reactionary petty bourgeoisie types that would happily help Rubio overthrow Latin American governments. You can’t do much about these people, sadly.  I think the best thing for Democrats is to get the Latinos that are more likely to vote for them (those of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Central American ancestry, and working class Latinos) to vote more. Only about 50% of eligible voters in these demographics voted. It’s especially low for men.  The same for Black people. A lot of American minority voters feel abandoned and disenfranchised. Hopefully Democrats will find a way to engage these voters instead of belittle them.  (Inb4 someone says that Latino men are sexist brutes that don’t vote for women: Latin America elected more female leaders than anywhere else in the world). ",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:21:03,4
What's more amazing is how the voters voted for the guy and the party...   ...who told them exactly what they would do. The very things the voter says is putting America on the wrong track.   ---    I think that a voter should lose the right to vote if they consistently vote in a manner that causes harm to both themselves and their other countrymen.   Sort of a Hippocratic Oath of voting.,Joadzilla,2025-04-29T09:25:12,5

Only 60%? It should be 100%. Just look at what they did to that Oklahoma family on Thursday. It’s a crime for even looking Mexican at this point.,yesiknowimsexy,2025-04-29T12:03:46,3
Did they think it would go another way or it would go this way but just not for them?,nikkothirty,2025-04-29T09:05:18,2
I'd be interested in knowing how many of that 60% belonged to the 42% of Latino voters who helped elect OrangeMan in 2024. That might help identify those whose voting error was caused something other than immutable stupidity.,phosdick,2025-04-29T10:04:46,2

Too bad so many of them voted for this.  Too bad so many more stayed home.  If only there had been some warning signs.,Hyperion1144,2025-04-29T12:02:44,1

"this will likely be cynically framed as a 'So why did they vote for him????' type of question, but it's important to recognize that Hispanics overwhelmingly voted for Democrats in the last few elections, except for 2024. The Biden administration was really just eroding every ounce of credibility over time, what an utter malpractice it looks like, in hindsight",BlackjackOC,2025-04-29T08:43:15,0
They would vote for him again tomorrow if Harris was the other choice though.,luri7555,2025-04-29T10:44:37,18
"If only he’d been overt about it in both campaigns.  I hope that other 40% wakes up and gets an invitation to their own lives.    This administration will shatter their Latino lives, citizen or not, intentional or accidentally, and it’s going to just be the cost of doing business.  When pressed to fix or restore what’s been broken, it’ll be treated too much like capitulation, and be flatly refused.  At best; the White House twitter account may *mock their suffering.*",TheOtherBookstoreCat,2025-04-29T11:59:00,3

"> I think that a voter should lose the right to vote if they consistently vote in a manner that causes harm to both themselves and their other countrymen.  Who makes that decision, though?

Don't forget that roughly 1/3 of eligible Latino voters also just stayed home.  Far too little blame seems to be being placed on the tens of millions of Americans who couldn't evenubither) even bother to try to stop this.,Hyperion1144,2025-04-29T12:04:12,1

"Hispanics in the United States are not conservative. Most approve of abortion and gay marriage. Plus, the biggest shift happened among U.S.-born Latinos, not Latino immigrants. Latino immigrants are a Democratic base.  I suppose that a lot of U.S. Latinos are way more influenced by American social norms than by Latino social norms. Extreme individualism, disdain for the community’s wellbeing, violent imperialism…",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:03:47,2
If Democrats were smart they would sweep in. Latinos having voted overwhelmingly Democrat for years means that they are open to vote for Democrats again. Unfortunately establishment liberals are not smart. Let’s hope a real leftist takes over the Democratic Party and guides them in the right direction. ,Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:05:13,1
"Without a doubt, but this is why it’s important for the Democratic Party to really bring their game with the midterms and next presidential election.  These elections are very winnable at this point.",jediporcupine,2025-04-29T10:45:43,5
"Surely laws against battery and murder can't be abused! What, they can?   Gosh, I guess we can't have them, then.   That's your argument?     ---  Every country on earth has laws stopping people from harming others or themselves. This is no different.",Joadzilla,2025-04-29T10:26:57,0
"Stop blaming the voters.  Democrats aren't entitled to the Latino vote. Or to the vote of any demographic for that matter.  The reason why people stayed home is because people had rightfully understood that Democrats and Republicans alike don't care about people.  Democrats have nobody to blame but themselves.  Instead of pointing the finger and alienating voters further, do a little introspection.  Stop trying to destroy things. Start building something.",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T12:29:46,-1
"A lot of Latinos are white.  I don’t understand why y’all gringos think that Latino = ”person of color.” My dad is mestizo and he has been discriminated by white Latinos because he has “indio” (indigenous) features.

They can’t keep trying to return to pre-trump business as usual. Americans aren’t patient enough for real government anymore.,luri7555,2025-04-29T10:47:28,3

">Democrats aren't entitled to the Latino vote.  Cool. They can tell that to ICE when they kick their doors in.   We're way past that ""not entitled to a vote"" excuse.   This isn't about entitlement. This is about doing what's necessary to protect your life and safety and that of your family.   Hierarchy of needs and such.

"And then they blamed them for election outcomes. Reddit looked like a KKK rally when the election results came out.  The people are tired of neoliberalism.

Being white is not a matter of last name and I don’t understand what you mean with “speak” unless you’re trying to argue that Latinos can’t speak English. Do you consider Spanish and Portuguese people nonwhite?,Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:15:51,3
"In america they have many Hispanic and Latino law makers  who have changed their last names and first names. Also, I’m  sure they worked really hard to lose their accents 🤷‍♂️ I wonder why",finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:24:20,2
lol first I’m not a gringo second it’s not my fault the way white people learn the last names of white passing Hispanic and Latino people and immediately revoke their white cards. Talk to them about that,finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:22:03,1

No jackass and you are purposely not understanding the point as to why they do that. Why do they do that?🤔,finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:29:26,1
"Losing accent once you’ve been speaking in English is common. Time passes.  I get what you’re trying to argue. That Anglo whites don’t consider white Latinos white.  If you knew the history of Latin America, you would understand that this is way more complicated. ",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:32:12,1
No. I know the entire history and you have to be the right kind of white even as a white person. So why white passing Hispanic and Latino people kissing white peoples ass to be part of the club will never not be funny to me,finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:34:29,1
"They are not kissing ass. Most of them are petty bourgeois types that have fully integrated into American society, thus have adopted its twisted values. They are reactionaries and vote for reactionaries.  Also, once again, “white passing” Latinos don’t exist. If a Latino looks white, they’re white.  Are you an U.S. Latino at least or the usual non-Latino who thinks they know better than actual Latin Americans?",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:38:19,1
lol no but once you announce your last name you aren’t white to them anymore. What don t you understand about that?🤔Well unless they change their names. There are reasons second generation Latin and Hispanic americans were given white names by their parents.  Edit: all that fitting in and kissing ass goes out the damn window,finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:41:05,1
Again I get what you’re saying.  It doesn’t change that many Latinos are white. The world is more than ignorant white Anglos.,Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:46:13,1
Of course but does this whiteness also give them advantages in their own countries ?🤔I’ve read many first hand accounts of Hispanic and Latino women’s families telling them to marry  lighter people and to stay away from people with darker skin. 🤔😭,finitefuck,2025-04-29T09:49:54,1
"Yes.  The thing you mention is very real, luckily it's a relic of past generations. Something grandmothers would say.   Often the dark-skinned ones. Because they were discriminated and wanted a better life for their children and grandchildren.",Scary-Set653,2025-04-29T09:52:52,1
