Right now I think the best likelihood to impeach him and successfully remove him is Trump openly defying a 9-0 supreme court order on bringing Abrego Garcia back.

Currently Dems have been a bit more silent on stuff which I was frustrated with, but I get the point. They want to make sure they don’t take media space so it can be focused entirely on the right and their failures; And it is working, Trump has hit his lowest approval ratings and is losing favor even with some Republicans.
