Maybe try appointing a Secretary of Defense who knows what he's doing?,gradientz,2025-04-25T01:47:07,33

Breaking News - Insurgent group with local support and knowledge of their country manage to evade modern military trying to defeat them by superior firepower and technology.  In other news a new book about how the USA failed to learn any lessons from Vietnam and Afghanistan has been published and rubbished in a private Signal chat group by the current Secretary of Defense as irrelevant in 2025.,_L_R_S_,2025-04-25T02:30:36,18
"Hegseth can't help it, how was he supposed to know that 'Houthis' on Signal wasn't Lt. John Houthis, USAF?",Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-04-25T02:09:40,7
"“In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, the militants have successfully shot down *at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones*, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.”  Multi-million dollar doesn’t really do it justice. The MQ-9 Reaper drones are purported to be about 30 million **each**.  Efficient!",SpookySchatzi,2025-04-25T02:26:27,6
"u don't win war against insurgence using an army, u do that using counter intelligence and years of preparation and infiltration.  it crazy that israel is the closet ally to the US yet they didn't learn that lesson from how they fought hezbollah.",SadEquipment2680,2025-04-25T03:12:34,7

Delusional Trump and Drunk Hegseth are getting their asses kicked.,gexckodude,2025-04-25T07:15:40,1
Hegseth will be on X in a few minutes explaining how removing DoD web pages will help the fight…,Efficient_Resist_287,2025-04-25T08:05:59,1
"Why the fuck are they trying to perform the SEAD mission with MQ-9s.  What the fuck are they thinking.  I cannot imagine why you would try to target air defense systems with a completely undefended, low flying, slow platform with no meaningful electronic warfare capabilities. Shooting these things down is about as easy as shooting down a Cessna because they were not meant to operate anywhere near contested airspace. So *why are we using them to target air defense systems*.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T10:20:04,1

Yes but I don’t think that will stop us from getting dog walked by the poorest nation in the world.,Clear-Awareness6114,2025-04-25T02:17:14,13
What I don't get is why the Houthi's are just SO much more capable than any of the other groups in the area. They always seem to manage to pull off crazy shit.,Semajal,2025-04-25T03:26:57,3

The UK are doing a bit and it's probably related to having aircraft carriers which not everyone has.,Swuzzlebubble,2025-04-25T03:12:44,2
">Is there any other country trying to eliminate them? If not, is it because they only want death to America and Israel?  The Saudis have a beef with them too (they used to attack Saudi oil fields a lot before the shipping focus), but the Saudi level of competence is lacking. They mostly just fly down and drop some bombs.  The US is actually trying to avoid random casualties, so surveillance is much higher.",jabrwock1,2025-04-25T10:10:33,2
It would be easy if they joined Signal. They can get the daily military update from the secretary directly.,kupomu27,2025-04-25T05:18:07,5
I am glad you are noticing this very one sided relationship. At the same time no one can fault Israel reticence.   The IDF is dealing with a former reality show “star” with loose lips and a former Fox News anchor as a compromised DoD Secretary…..you know IDF intelligence agents are listening inside his computer and must be horrified.,Efficient_Resist_287,2025-04-25T08:27:38,0
