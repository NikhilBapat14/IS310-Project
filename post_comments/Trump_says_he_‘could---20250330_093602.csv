Almost as if he doesn't care about anyone but himself.   That's so unlike him,MrIrrelevantsHypeMan,2025-03-30T09:37:47,107
And his cult followers will continue to support him.,NoneOfThisMatters_XO,2025-03-30T09:46:50,26
"Ya, he doesn't care about auto prices, or energy prices. Or inflation.  What's hard to fathom is how Republicans running in these replacement races and mid terms are saying that they support Trump's efforts to reduce prices, fight inflation, etc. And we know it's a lie. I'm thinking of the never ending Rand Fine ads on TV atm.   Why can't Republicans see this?",Mrknowitall666,2025-03-30T10:09:22,19

Because the auto manufacturer that will be least affected is…. wait for it…. Tesla.  As long as his billionaire overlord is happy and funneling money into Trump’s broke ass pockets… he DGAF!,Prudent_Fly_2554,2025-03-30T10:15:33,3
He just threatened automakers not to raise their prices.,baby_budda,2025-03-30T10:32:32,3
I have seen reports of him saying he doesn't care if prices go up and I've seen reports where he says their not allowed to raise prices because of tariffs. What's the truth?  Did he say both?,RoyalRobinBanks,2025-03-30T09:59:55,6

I disagree that people are going to blindly support him.  Hardcore MAGA will never falter - but the majority of Trump voters aren’t going to be able to withstand these price increases on pretty much everything.,OttoOtter,2025-03-30T10:00:20,2

"Democratic politicians aren't going to save us.   Sure. Holding some town halls helps, because it creates conversations and local communities.   But we, the people, who are pro-democracy Americans, need to get out and start talking to our neighbors, co-workers, friends, and family members who did not vote in the last election. We need to wake up millions of those people.   And you can't wait for the Democratic politicians to reach them. They aren't listening to Democratic leaders. Which is why *we* have to talk to them face to face (or on the phone). Get them to see Trump for who he is and what he is about.   So, start doing that. Start talking to other Democrats you know and get them to do that. And quit hanging out on social media complaining that Democratic leaders aren't doing enough for you.",raistlin65,2025-03-30T13:31:59,2

"I could literally write a book on what the Democrats should do. For starters, they (we) should assign every house and senate member a task to follow a single aspect of Trump’s insanity, drill deep, go one Sunday shows, talk loud. Provide leadership and explain what Dems will do different. We should have a countdown clock of the next election running continually. Representatives should be at car mfg plants. At non-for-profits losing funding, at Columbia, advocating for each and every person wrongly taken by ice, in Greenland, meeting with Canadian leaders, holding Tesla sledge hammer fund raisers, oh my god the list goes on and on.",roblewk,2025-03-30T10:52:55,-2

">So you are lecturing me for posting on social media by … wait for it … posting on social media!  Well, I guess if you only allow your pride to react because someone disagreed with you on Reddit, you might see it that way.  Rather than recognizing that I'm passing on the strategy to other Democrats by posting in the Democrat subreddit. Let that revelation sink in.  >But the thing is, I wasn’t elected.
