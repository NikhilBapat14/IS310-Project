">The U.S. should remove all ""unilateral tariff measures"" against China ""if it truly wanted"" to solve the trade issue, Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong said on Thursday.  >""The person who tied the bell must untie it,"" he told reporters at a regular press conference.  Over/under on Trump handling this in a way that doesn't completely fuck us?",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-04-25T01:15:36,19
"> ""China and the United States have not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a separate news briefing, calling reports of such information ""false news"".  trump saying there have been negotiations is lying to try to save face having to grovel and backtrack.   trump is as dumb as dog shit and should never have implemented his stupid tariffs in the first place.  Should have negotiated trade deals with each country privately.",netsheriff,2025-04-25T01:46:29,8
"It would be the right thing to do to keep the cost of so much of what we buy from skyrocketing. But alas, Trump isn't welknown for *ever* doing the right thing.",invalidpassword,2025-04-25T01:29:27,4
"I don't think people understand how bad it's going to get in coming months unless Trump tries to unring that tariff bell ASAP. The summer months will get ugly quickly, with empty store shelves, quickly rising food prices, and lots of small businesses going under. And it's going to be exacerbated by the massive downturn in tourism to the United States.  And those shipping channels take time to restore. You're not turning them on immediately just by removing tariffs. It'll take months to fully ramp things up if we allow them to stop.   It's still mostly avoidable at this point, but given Trump's track record I'm not optimistic on him swallowing his pride and cancelling the tariffs.",supes1,2025-04-25T02:26:36,3
"Rebooting these global supply chains will take months. The stock in the system is running down and won't currently be replenished. Look at any of the ports/shipping/trucking data - everything China-US is pretty much at a standstill.  The US is facing empty shelves and shut down domestic factories in weeks and there is literally nothing that can be done to stop it.  The longer he dicks around with Tariffs the bigger and longer the impact will be.  Trump has already lost the trade war, like a plane when the wings fall off it just hasn't hit the ground yet.",newtoallofthis2,2025-04-25T04:58:27,4
"- China has all the cards here and they can easily maintain ""unconditional surrender"" by trump and his enablers...matter of time when the markets truly crash as the investor world understands this and trump unable to run up the white flag. He wnt down the road of his typically bullying and will learn the hardway China (and MOST Asian cultures) do not bend to bullying and ""losing face""",decaturbob,2025-04-25T04:56:56,2
China's tariffs are reciprocal.    Trump can eliminate them at any time just like he caused them in the first place.  There's no need for China to negotiate anything.,Searchlights,2025-04-25T06:35:17,2
