"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden on Thursday as the White House continues to purge the federal government of those perceived to oppose the president and its agenda.  The dismissal was disclosed in statements from three top House Democrats and confirmed by a separate person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity before it was made public.  Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Hayden was ‚Äúcallously fired‚Äù by Trump and demanded an explanation from the administration as to why.  ‚ÄúDr. Hayden‚Äôs tenure has been marked by a steadfast commitment to accessibility, modernization, and the democratization of knowledge,‚Äù DeLauro said in a statement. ‚ÄúHer dismissal is not just an affront to her historic service but a direct attack on the independence of one of our most revered institutions.‚Äù",bengibbardstoothpain,2025-05-08T20:36:05,190

"While that was initially my knee jerk reaction too, there is an unfortunate discussion on the status of the librarian as an executive officer and mentions the Presjdent‚Äôs ability to remove the librarian. It‚Äôs a decision out of the DC Circuit. I‚Äôd like to see a legal challenge in this context though.

"I don't support him in the least. I can identify what he is because I was raised to support someone like him politically for the first 19 years of my life. I don't know why but all of the indoctrination didn't stick. I remember the things my parents said in the 90's. I remember my neighbors being nasty Democrats until the Democrats nominated a Black Guy then they became Trumpers.  If what I was raised with was not atypical, and I have no reason to assume it was atypical, then how many people raised like me are not like me? I am rare, and that is what scares me. When I ask people if they remember Jeff Sessions appointing a Special Counsel when it became clear that the 1st term Trump did something in the election. Now he can point to the AG and say, ""talk to my attorney.""  It's insane. Just for my example of the AG being his attorney, the AG is an expert on Criminal Law, not Constitutional Law, that would be the Office of Legal Counsel. Why is he pointing to a criminal law expert saying they are saying what he is doing is ok. All the AG can do is say they won't allow the DOJ to investigate the action under criminal law. The AG can't even say it isn't a crime without being implicated themselves in a crime. The Office of Legal Counsel is the arbiter if a Presidential Act is Constitutional. What are they saying? Are they saying it is unconstitiutional but then Trump turns to the AG and Bondi says she doesn't think violating the Constitution is criminal?  To the media the Office of Legal Counsel doesn't exist right now, and as a result it doesn't exist to the voters. And how many people like me don't see that? How many don't remember? How can they not remember? If I am so rare for simply remembering, is being able to remember making me socially defined as insane?  And I have been seeing this for over 15 years. I can't tell you how much this sucks.",stevez_86,2025-05-09T08:46:59,6

"Sorry, I guess, my math was off a bit. He was voted in by 11/25ths of eligible voters.  Yep, he won the electoral college. Eligible voter turnout for the 2024 presidential election was 63.7%, https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2024:_Analysis_of_voter_turnout_in_the_2024_general_election  , which means Trump‚Äôs slim popular vote victory of 77,284,118 votes, or 49.8 percent of the votes, are votes from approx 44% of all 174,000,000 eligible voters.    He currently has an approval rating, as aggregated from reliable polls at 41%. So, even his own base of bigots and morons is losing faith in him.   But keep patting yourself on the back while we lose our standing in the world, break our constitution, and devastate our economy and give it all away to billionaires.

"The people whose job it is to check his authority and maintain the delicate balance of power between branches of government have shamefully abdicated their responsibilities and effectively signaled that he can do whatever the fuck he wants.  ‚ÄúLegally‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really mean anything when the people in charge of enforcing the laws are compromised. Our Constitution was written by ancient men who could not fathom the concept of a government overrun by shameless self-serving parasites, all acting in concerted bad faith to undermine the whole system. Republicans have invested decades of work into portraying these men as divinely gifted with infallible foresight and the piece of paper they wrote as holy scripture that should never be changed.",Vyar,2025-05-09T04:54:38,7
">I don't support him in the least.  My bad, and my most humble apologies. I made an incorrect assumption, thus demonstrating why making assumptions based on minimal evidence is usually a bad idea.  Yes, it‚Äôs pretty clear that the US is not-so-slow-walking itself into an autocratic regime. I think you only escaped after Trump‚Äôs first term because on the advice of Dan Quayle, Pence wouldn‚Äôt go along with Plan A (Plan B was storming the capital, and I don‚Äôt even want to think about what Plan C might have been). Who would have imagined that Dan Quayle and Mike Pence would be the ones to save America, even temporarily? Not I.  This time he‚Äôs surrounded by nothing but sycophants, backed up by the team behind Project 2025, who appear to have done their homework.   I do think that many conservative voters never learned to think for themselves, which makes it easy to lead them by ~~the nose~~ emotion, primarily fear and anger. And I don‚Äôt know how you fix that. We have some here in Canada too, but they‚Äôre a much smaller percentage of the population. Yet I‚Äôm still concerned we will follow America‚Äôs example, as we sometimes do.  Anyway, again I‚Äôm sorry for misunderstanding your reply. Hopefully we will all come out of this mess with our democracies intact.  Best to you.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-09T10:11:19,5
