">What evidence is there of anything like that?  They have little chance of winning. Like statistically it is near 100% certainly either a Democrat or Republican will win. These parties know this, it isn't a secret. So just putting a background here, this is why many people think third parties aren't serious parties.  But the Green Party has no real plans or strategy to do anything outside the Presidential Election every 4 years. They don't try to win city/state seats in left-leaning communities in the US or seek to create a starting point for their party. If they were more successful or obviously trying to start a local swell of support, they might be taken more seriously.  A popular thought is that the Green Party has achieved only TWO things in the past 30 years: Getting Bush elected in 2000 and getting Trump elected in 2016. Both of their achievements directly hurt their own cause.  Additionally, the Green Party has previously received money and support from the Republican Party, leading many people to jump on the ""spoiler"" bandwagon.  https://apnews.com/general-news-65e9d5d001dfd10c86ca9ab37e53e159  https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/img-src-images-santorum1-jpg-hspace-5-vspace-5-align-left-gop-donors-funded-entire-pa-green-party-drive  https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/14/green-party-lawyers-have-ties-gop-counties-association/5791100002/",ProLifePanda,2024-08-28T12:23:43,58
"In 2000 Ralph Nader ran as a Green Canididate and the votes he pulled from Al Gore in Florida flipped the state over the Bush. this cost Al Gore the election and we got the second Iraq war.   The same thing happened in Maine as LePage only won because there was a indepeneded running and pulling more votes from the Demecrat. After the election it was found out that LePage was paying the independent to keep running as they would get more Dem votes that GOP votes and that is the only reason LePage won.

"Let's put aside the Green Party has an almost zero percent chance of winning. Let's pretend by some miracle Jill Stein actually does win office, somehow. By some absolute magic, her policy positions are actually relevant. Now what?  Jill Stein would be president, but she still wouldn't have any party members in Congress. She has no legislative power at all. Even if her ideas were good, why would we expect the other parties to just put aside everything they believe in and pass the laws Stein asks them to pass? They don't do that for their *own* party. Why would they do that for Green?  It's bad to vote for Green because they very literally aren't a real political party. Political parties aren't just guys at the top talking about their personal beliefs. Political parties are groups of people united in working towards a set of common goals and principles, spread across all levels of society and government. No matter how much you like Jill Stein personally, she doesn't have a party to back her. Voting for her is as good an idea as voting for your neighbor Gary, or me, or your cat--even if we work with the assumption that she is going to win.  If the Green Party was anything more than an absolute scam trying to rook vulnerable people out of their political donations, then they wouldn't run for President at all. They'd instead work to build up a political party by connecting with voters at a grassroots level, as they start to find potential candidates for office. That's what the Green Party does in other countries. But in the US as currently constructed, the Green and Libertarian parties are nothing more than a bad faith superPAC that's lying to you about their intentions and capability.",mormagils,2024-09-03T11:20:43,1
"Facts:     -Green Party has zero chance of winning the presidency.   -They do garner enough votes to tilt the election, mostly from Democrat votes since GP is more in line with Dem ideals and platforms.   -Anyone seriously into Green Party ideals would obviously be more better represented by a Dem candidate than a GOP candidate. Green party can have issues with Dems, but letting the GOP candidate win is retarded if you actually care that much.   -Jill Stein is indeed either unserious and thus undeserving, or in bed with Russia or the GOP, or both.      You don't owe Dems your vote. But if you're actually passionate then you wouldn't be wasting your vote and letting someone like Trump win. And the more people support the Green Party the stronger their spoiler effect. So you're better off supporting Dem candidates that embody more Green Party agendas, and if Jill was serious she'd stop spoiler campaigns and just focus all party energy on achieving ranked choice voting so they'd actually be viable.",texasradio,2024-09-10T19:17:25,1

"There is no evidence of anything like that.  This is the usual fallacy that surfaces pretty much in any country where there are a few dominant parties and other smaller parties trying to make their way. ""You're dividing the vote waaan""  In reality, there is little to no evidence that green part voters would be voting Democrat if they didn't have the greens to vote for. The largest electoral group in the US is... you guessed it... non-voters. More likely than not, the lion's share of green voters would simply not be voting at all, or would be voting for any other fringe party out there. They are overwhelmingly composed of voters who believe both the Democrats and the Republicans are beyond the pale.  But again, that is always how the argument goes. There is no better demonstration of the Democrat's sense of entitlement to progressive votes than the way they react to the greens. Acting as if they effectively just steal votes they should own by default. It's amazing to hear that coming from the party that presumes to be the one and only party interested in democracy.  In fact, it's the Democrats' job to convince people to vote for them, by representing and promoting policies they want to vote for, and by deserving their trust that they will indeed enact those policies if elected.  And btw, it's kinda ridiculous to see AOC trashing the greens, saying things like ""if you can't grow your movement in so much time, you're just failing"" or somthing like that. In short, AOC belongs to a party that receives billions of dollars in campaign funding from the corporate class, and actively uses that funding to crush parties such as the Greens, either by litigating endlessly to straight up keep them off the ballots and to drain their modest resources, making sure their media allies give basically no oxygen to 3rd parties, keep them out of debates, etc. And then that same party seizes on the result of these attacks to say ""see, you're not growing, you're not a real party.""  That alone is probably contemptuous enough to convince many voters to never vote blue.",dEm3Izan,2024-09-28T01:28:55,1
"The green party has enabled the republicans to wind the presidency twice, so I can't imagine how that helps their goals.

The green party has no plan. It never tries to win over the people in local or state elections so it doesn't have any public support. And while I do hate the two party system voting a third party into the presidency will do nothing. they can't get rid of the electoral college which is the reason we have a two party system. They won't have any allies in congress except MAYBE the progressives but they are still a minority in congress. They might be able to stop weapon aid to Israel with the veto at most ( this is as far as I can tell the main reason people are trying to vote for the green party ). And lets face it we care WAY too much about the presidency sure it's a powerful position but it was designed to have limited power. If we want change as a nation we need third parties to focus on Congress not the presidency.,Alternative-Carrot52,2024-10-08T13:37:48,1

I guess folks forget that Trump lies and saying third parties only take from Dems is to distract from the reality that he pushed more than twice as many toward Gary Johnson AND Jill Stein  [CBS news exit polls 2016](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/)  So yeah, just let the candidates run their races and vote however you want to.

"There is nothing wrong with it. However, many will say it is a wasted vote for a good reason.  Consider this:  1) Democrats and Green Party share a lot of similar political ideologies (environmentalism, social justice, democracy in the hands of the people, etc.), and  2) Democrats and Republicans are the only parties with a realistic chance to win in the current political environment of the US  So, because the Green party is basically an extension of the democratic party, voting for the third party while they don't have enough support means you're (figuratively) throwing a vote away and giving an advantage to a party who has complete opposite political views than you.   Democrats need third party and independent voters more than Republicans need third party and independent voters. This is also the reason in the event of close election, Democrats always lose them.

"Because people buy major party propaganda and believe voting Third Party ""costs"" elections, when it doesn't. I would never, ever, in a million years, vote for the Democrats or ""Center-left"" Neoliberals, so they never ""lost"" my vote because they never had it. I will never, ever give a ""thumbs up"" to Neoliberal polices.  Also voting third party does a lot to shift the debate. People pretend Third Parties ""do nothing"" but surging third parties cause massive ricochets through the political system. Look at Brexit, literally caused by a third party with a single rep, simply because they ate into Conservative polling come Election time. If the Green Party got 20% of the Democratic Party vote, you can be sure the Democrats absolutely would not be watering down Environmental policies like they usually do.  Sure the Greens might not win Presidency in living memory, but why in hell would you give you thumbs up to Neoliberals? There is no such thing as ""pushing them left"" when they are in power, the vote is the only voice you have. There is a reason Democrats don't move left, it's because the left never utilizes it's power, meanwhile ""Moderate"" swing voters do. (Also ""Moderate"" is a misnomer here, perhaps even a majority of these swing voters are economically left, socially conservative, the exact opposite position of the Dems and Republicans, so they bounce between based on usually what minimal policies resonate with them). Another issue is when you vote ""Yes"" to the Democrats, it is read by the media and politicians you are voting ""yes"" to their entire platform.  The Greens have issues. But they are not really known by people outside of the party. Typical factional ones, also the party due to being entirely volunteer based and ""New Age"" adjacent has many cranks, but lets be real, no worse than the Dems or Republicans who are filled with actively hostile cranks with terrible economic and social worldviews.",VampKissinger,2024-09-06T09:32:16,0

And frankly, I agree. I agree that our two party system sucks. But realistically, Stein has no chance of winning the 2024 election. The green party isn't going to go from 0.3% last election season to winning this one... and Stein isn't going to go from 1.1% in 2016 to winning 2024.  Earlier this year the French had National Assembly elections. The first round of elections were disastrous. The extreme right had so many votes, it seemed certain that they would gain control of the assembly. The shattered left was able to quickly put together a coalition in attempts to stave off the fascist extreme right. During the elections, the left and the center made a pact that if one of them had more votes for the first round of elections, the other would drop out in the second round and encourage their constituents to vote for the other. Many left and far left candidates voluntarily dropped out (some even dropped out despite having more votes in the first round, but the center candidate refused to go), and many people willingly voted for a center party run by Macron of whom they despise. They all knew that the existence of another party on the ballot is a high risk of allowing the extreme right to gain power.   The Green Party of the United States doesn't have this kind of mentality. They care more about their existence on the presidential ballot than the risk of a Trump presidency, a risk to everything the party fights for. Rather than focusing on putting Green politicians into substantial offices and helping the Democrats stave off a growing wave of fascism that the Republican party is more than willing to let in, the Green party would rather seek for relevancy by their existence on the presidential ballot.",bjlwasabi,2024-10-01T12:29:38,1

"Just weighing in on the fallacy that most so-called liberals spout about Trump being somehow existentially worse on climate than the dems. According to Politico: ""Oil production has soared on public lands under Biden, growing by roughly 530,000 barrels a day since 2020. The country is currently producing more oil every year [than any country in history](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.""  Also the Pentagon is the #1 contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and Biden approved an 864 billion dollar ""defense"" budget last year. The US supported genocide in Gaza, which has utilized more bombs by weight and power than WWII, has contributed to huge increases in climate emissions. According to the Guardian: ""First months of conflict produced more planet-warming gases than 20 climate-vulnerable nations do in a year, study shows"".  I only bring this up to point out that so many people buy into the rhetoric of the Democratic party and ignore their actions. Or they pick and choose. Are the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Acts incredible feats? Of course. Has Biden also continued and hardened Trump's border policy while also hypocritically spouting pro-immigration rhetoric? Of course.

"Because, when elections are close, it works -- like it did in 2016.  In the specific case of Jill Stein, she also appears to be part of Putin's ""Foreign Influence Operation"" to sway elections.

There's that infamous photo of her sitting at Putin's table at an event in Moscow for the Russian state TV network. Not to mention...  >Her political views often align with the Kremlin and mirror the talking points heard on Russian state TV. She claims the American political system is rigged, opposes the notion of American exceptionalism, is a vocal critic of US military operations overseas and downplays the impact of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

"I hear this thing about her crawling out of a hole every four years. She hardly gets any attention to begin with, but she does seem to comment on things in off years on Twitter and does seem to plug candidates in off years as well.   I think there definitely is this effect where the Green Party candidate has the most traction in elections in which the democrat is more distinct from the Green Party candidate. They don’t pull hardly any votes in districts that already have progressive democrats running and it would make sense that they wouldn’t feel the need to run against them for the most part.   The question is why the Democratic Party is ever in a position in which left wing votes can be pulled away from the Democratic Party to begin with. I guess the Democratic Party is appealing to centrists in those areas.   So if you think about it, let’s say that the democrat did indeed decide to win the votes from the left wing so that the Green Party got fewer votes and didn’t spoil the election. The reason, from a purely non-ideological standpoint, would be that the center left votes would then be alienated from the party and vote for the republicans.   So it does seem like, whenever democrats want to accuse the Green Party of stealing votes from the left and handing the election to republicans, it does seem like there’s this implication that all of the sudden, the centrists will actually vote directly for republicans.   So there’s a tacit implication that there are centrist democrats that *aren’t loyal* that would swing the election if democrats  decided to appeal to Green Party voters. No?   Maybe there’s just no way to get all of the votes. But I think if republicans are pretty far right (as trump is) it really shouldn’t be that difficult to just appeal to the GP voters and tell the centrists: “do you really want a trump presidency again?” Just as you’re doing now.",Optimistbott,2024-08-29T13:30:42,1

"You know, there’s a McDonald’s in Guantanamo bay. Isn’t that crazy af?   I understand the first past the post. I’m not in a swing state, so my vote for the president simply doesn’t matter really at all, so I feel comfortable voting for whoever I want.   It’s the same sort of thing with the dumbass moderates. The Democratic Party has made the decision to appeal to them rather than the Green Party voters. That’s a calculation they’ve made that it makes more sense to try to win moderate voters because there are more of them.   But the thing is that with someone like AOC or another left wing democrat, if they were to be running, you’d hopefully be saying the same exact thing to moderates who underestimate fascism. So it’s a calculation that has to be made in those swing states. I hope Kamala does try to appeal more to those voters if they are a liable to swing the election. That would be the smart thing to do. But it’s probably that their polling suggests that they won’t win those states if they try to appeal to the left. So it’s like, either way. I think Kamala is probably going to win.

"Joe Manchin is beyond the pale and a complicated question. And if you are in an actually safe seat this math is actually different (though giving Kamala a mandate to govern if that still exists is something to consider), but definitely look at polls cause frequently fewer people are than people actually think.   The real problem is in having this discussion without every very specific qualifier on the table in front of the internet randos so they can’t convince themselves others agree with them and then pull this in Pennsylvania. It is actually very important that they run to the center but motivate the base, fortunately they haven’t run to the right on anything but border policy (and even then just in terms of rhetoric), literally all of their policy continues to be lefter and lefter but their talking points are aimed at the center and educated people need to not be babies and read the briefs. The only reason Joe Manchin matters is there aren’t more democratic senators to make his protest votes irrelevant.  And the time and place to push them on policy positions or rhetoric we don’t like was in primary season against reps and senators, people do make claims about electability there too but it’s where the change actually begins to happen. The thing is Walz and Harris aren’t leftist icons, the entire discourse with AOC would have to be different by necessity because she is a different candidate and the only way to win would be furthering development of the young end of the base.  If they were actually moving to the right I’d have these concerns, they just have to rhetorically exist as both the center and the well meaning challenge to it (which is what they always have been) but it basically cannot ever be about punishing those in power. The left has enough mechanisms and the capacity for shame to remove most problematic elements of the party that do not compromise the whole, and we should thank our lucky stars it’s barely even a hard choice compared to places like India or South Africa. The other answer is political systems don’t have this assumption that the only lever we have is voting because in parliamentary mmp systems the leadership of the party is basically decided by the party - they can’t get rid of individuals who step out of line so the understanding that those in power need to be responsive to the needs of the public despite the public having voted for them is much more accepted.  I also think they should be responsive to the needs of the public. I would love if they had a New Deal Era sized coalition to actually give any of it a shot though and then we can complain if they fumble it. In 2008-2010 they arguably did on some issues, but to be fair they were also busy, but that’s the last time they have actually been in power and then before that… basically modern conservatives at the head of dems in the 90’s after an age of conservative realignment in the 80’s.. and then like Carter? They have literally never had a chance in living memory to pursue and cement progressive change and the only time that ever has happened was under FDR, where after making everything better by basically just not doing the dumb stuff Republicans were he got a massive coalition and could then pursue many effective policies. The right had to change to even be in the room anymore. And the reason that happened was everyone got the heck on board.

You ignore suggestion that they could do things differently, insult the people you talk with, and insist they can only take this conversation a direction you want it to go.  Get over it, dude. GP is a farce, and you don't get to choose what other people say or think.",[deleted],2024-08-29T10:06:16,1
"The GP has an agenda. That agenda is not make sure Dems lose. If that were the case, they wouldn’t be endorsing certain Dems in local races.",dickpierce69,2024-08-29T09:39:04,1
You replied to my answer. You decided to insert yourself. I didn’t seek you out and tell you that you were wrong. You came to me and said I am wrong while providing zero evidence as to how. All I’m asking for is your evidence that you continually refuse to provide.,dickpierce69,2024-08-29T10:09:40,0
"So Republicans support Green candidates because they agree with their policy agenda? Lol As candidates, Green Party is only a spoiler party. They could form any number of policy advocacy organizations. They don't cause they don't get well intentioned rubes (or bad intentioned conservatives) handing them money that way. What they get paid for, and what they do, is running spoilers.",[deleted],2024-08-29T09:42:37,1
"You didn't start this post, we all ""inserted oureelves,"" lmao maybe I'm a spoiler commenter?   You're here loudly insisting that the GP as a political party doesn't exist to run spoilers, yet when I ask something like ""why not just do political advocacy?"" You ignore it. I already pointed out Nader and Stein, so have others, and you have just doubled down saying that isn't what *you* want to talk about lol",[deleted],2024-08-29T10:13:15,1
Dems donate to LP candidates. Because it helps their own cause. That doesn’t mean the GP and LP solely exist with the intent to spoil elections. You’re either incredibly dense or willfully ignorant.,dickpierce69,2024-08-29T09:47:50,0

"It means that is their only practical purpose, and it is the one that gets them funded and keeps them relevant.   It is their sole purpose. The rest is just window dressing.  Cool insults, I bet those will make your wrong ideas right.",[deleted],2024-08-29T09:48:46,0
"You ignored every Green Party candidate again. You're getting torn to pieces in these comments. You have only rhetoric, very repetitious rhetoric. I don't believe you're a serious person.",[deleted],2024-08-29T10:18:02,1
"Show me, in their party platform, where their sole function is to spoil Dems.   Show me how them endorsing far left Dems spoils said Dems from winning.    Sole purpose and functions as are two completely different things. You are objectively wrong in your assertion that they exist only to spoil elections. This is incorrect. Functionally, that’s mainly what they do, but it is not their purpose.",dickpierce69,2024-08-29T09:54:04,-1
"lol, I’m not getting torn to pieces. Literally nobody has produced proof of this mythical sole purpose. Please I’ll beg you. Prove me wrong. All I can about is hard evidence. Show me that this is objective and not just your opinion.",dickpierce69,2024-08-29T10:21:45,0
"Lololol run out of insults?   >Show me, in their party platform, where their sole function is to spoil Dems.   Someone once told me, ""you're either incredibly dense or willfully ignorant."" I feel like that guy was projecting.  >Show me how them endorsing far left Dems spoils said Dems from winning.   Show me how it helps; those people were going to vote Dem anyway, since Republicans are the antithesis of the green platform.   >Sole purpose and functions as are two completely different things.  This is your hill, and you're going to hold it, right? Sucks, because *there is no other purpose* for the green party, as evidenced by how nothing else they've done ever mattered haha",[deleted],2024-08-29T09:57:13,2

"You’re the one answer OP’s question dishonestly, not me.   You have made the claim this is their sole purpose and I want cited, indisputable proof that this is the case. Please, I’d love for you to prove me wrong because all I care about is factual information. Show me that this is their single, sole functioning purpose.",dickpierce69,2024-08-29T10:00:33,-1
"You have repeated yourself so much, I assume, because you have nothing substantive to say; you refuse to move this conversation any other direction and think that through simple repetition and ad hominem attacks you will get me to... shut up? Cause you are not honestly trying to explain or persuade anything/anyone.  Now you're going to demand I show you something that you have literally seen happen before with Nader and Stein, which you will only claim ""that isn't OP's question!!!""   Get real, dude.",[deleted],2024-08-29T10:09:30,2
