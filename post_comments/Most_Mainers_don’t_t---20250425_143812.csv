For that reason, if Tom Begich or Mary Peltola challenge him, I very much believe 2026 is the year he could be beaten. (I also think whichever of the two doesn't go for Senate, should go for the at-large seat)  The rest of those states are highly unlikely unless they can finally find that populist message or maybe try to run as independent.

"Simple if the democrats run a piece of stale bread . Then the republicans run a bowl of diarrhea . If you as a democrat decide not to vote for the stale bread and let the bowl of diarrhea win . How  do you then blame the bowl of diarrhea , or the people who ran the stale bread ? You had  an easy decision to make and chose not to make it !",Corn3076,2025-04-25T17:27:31,-8
"At what point did Biden ignore the people? He passed major legislation to save the economy from collapse, supported climate action, scientific research, education, infrastructure, added support to strengthen the ACA, tried to pass voting rights legislation and immigration reform… at what point do I look at progressives and not see people complaining and whining just because they didn’t get their way?",smiama36,2025-04-26T10:32:11,0
"If the stale bread says no everything is fine, its my turn to be elected, and ill support and be friends with the people that want to strip away your humanity, then I would get why they didn't show up, even though I still do. If a robber mugs me, and the police say, of well itd be rude to go arrest him, Im, going to blame them both.  They are supposed to lead us so they need to put forward candidates who will actually do that. They want to be the chosen ones without putting in the fucking work, or taking risks. The dems have a great moment here and they need to get their heads out of their asses instead of running the same bland ""republicans are just misunderstood"" candidates time and again.  Once again, its a two way street, politicians need voters and voters need candidates.   Republican's are still responsible for their actions, on top of all of this btw. If the fire dept doesnt bother to show, im still going to blame the arsonist for starting the fire.",pimparo0,2025-04-25T17:38:06,10
"And deflection three !! Now we are making up nonsense . Notice how when democrats are in power that things run relatatively smoothly ? While they may not give us everything we want they do offer incremental progress .  That’s the stale bread .   Then on the other hand when republicans are in control everything goes to hell ! Economy , personal rights ,  due process and so on and so forth . That’s the diarrhea !   Basically if Democrats don’t get every single thing they want immediately they whine like babies and sit things out . Then blame the DNC for not giving them EVERYTHING , and let the bowl of diarrhea win . It’s literally an insane position to take but carry on .  Stale bread got the economy humming , student loans erased , infrastructure built , predatory bank practices stopped and the most pro union president since FDR . But nope that wasn’t good enough for democrats !! Kamala wasn’t exciting enough to run on that stale platform . So you stayed home and chose this !   Yep it’s the DNC’s fault ! Lmao .  You can’t make this crap up !! Democrats need to grow up !",Corn3076,2025-04-25T17:58:40,-4
