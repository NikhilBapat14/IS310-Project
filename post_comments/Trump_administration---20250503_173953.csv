"Maybe this is a hot take but like cmon… this is the CIA here. I’m not about to die on the hill of the CIA, or the TSA.   Like sure I get the sense of dread of watching the American empire crumble around us, and trumps undoubtedly doing this to further his own malignant agenda, but that doesn’t mean every part of the American government is worth losing sleep over. It was hardly perfect before he rolled down that escalator in 2015.",Ja3k_Frost,2025-05-03T19:47:59,-1

"The thing is, I’m not even sure they can do this the way they want.  I would bet a substantial amount of money that a lot of what the CIA especially does is out of the scope of what the President can control.   He can fire a bunch of front facing paper pushers, but there’s probably a whole secret roster of people doing most of the actual dirty work that are hidden under a rock you shouldn’t turn over.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-03T17:52:59,7

"Yeah the husband will hide the fact that he was laid off from his wife, pretend to leave for work, then sneak in the back door after she leaves for the office.  But then she’ll sneak back in the house too, because, unbeknownst to him, she was ALSO a spy who was simultaneously laid off.  They’ll find out they worked for different spy agencies that were performing internal investigations on each other’s units, before having a series of elaborate gun battles between different rooms in their large New England upper middle class home.  They’ll wind up in a standoff at the top of the main staircase, but, when they go to shoot each other, one gun will jam and the other will be empty. They’ll laugh it all off, fuck on the balcony, then decide to buy a small defunct zoo together.",AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-05-03T22:00:23,11
