This is one of those things that doesn't live outside of the media and in the real world.   Nobody is going to scream at a pregnant woman for being a conservative bigot.   Or push a couple to start having babies (except for direct family maybe),Dutchtdk,2025-04-26T14:14:44,460

"No, it is not about being soft, it is about having critical thinking skills. The more educated a society gets...the less children they have.    The difference between myself and your hypothetical Ice Age woman is that I have a background that gives me the ability to think long term, look at various critical factors in child rearing success and make a calculated estimate on the return of investment in a child.    If the chance of that child having a good life does not reach a critical threshold for me, it is not worth having the child.    The concept of it being an obligation (Religious outlook) or the previous argument of it being something you just do (ignore risk assessment) are the stances of those with less critical thinking skills. De facto this does not include people who do the same assessments I would do but decide the risk ratio is worth it to them, that threshold is very personal.    What I find so fascinating is that now that Trump is in office, the zealotry is coming out from the cracks on the Republican side of the table. I am not surprised to see so much bible thumping, judgemental bullshit coming from r/Conservative now that the pendulum has swung.    People who do not want to have kids (excluding abortion) for whatever their reasons are not yours or anyone else's to judge. Much as I despised the woke movement for telling people how they must be or act, I feel no different on the other end of the horseshoe which is now feeling it has a chance to push it's agenda.    I don't direct this specifically at your comment, but in general to the vibe I am seeing in this chain of conversations I've had on this topic.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-27T13:08:01,7
"Yeah, I can't agree in the slightest. Bringing new life into the world on the potential chance that they have a significantly worse life than my own or that they won't be provided everything that I expect them to have throughout their life until self sufficiency. To me ignoring that seems like the decision of the selfish or the self righteous.  And, to be frank, the majority of the U.S. agrees with me, with it being one of the top reasons why people are not having kids these days, no ability to provide the basic rooted expectations (owning a home and having a steady career), and the very real possibility of the child living a worse life than their parent.  But it's a very personal decision, so if you're being snarky/sarcastic with your comment read this: >!Stuff it in your own pipe and smoke it.!<  Otherwise, carry on. I can see your point insomuch that it's your choice for what to do with your own life.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-26T14:12:20,73
I do think it's cowardly.  It's a lib move to hide shortcomings by a false sense of intellectual superiority.   I'm pregnant with my first and the idea that my child is at a disadvantage because we have to walk 2 blocks to a park because we live in an apartment is comical.
