"All of this makes my lack of religious beliefs even stronger. He's not a righteous person, but he's catering to the churches. He's a snake oil salesman. So it makes all of this so disingenuous to me. If you want to believe in god, cool. Leave me the hell out of it. Don't force your shit on me.",twstdbydsn,2025-05-02T10:51:51,21

A number of the Project 2025 chapters were written by either members of Opus Dei or people affiliated to Opus Dei. And so I think that you can see really what kind of an agenda this network of people are really intent on pushing.

"This isn't about religion. This is about making the US Christian church subordinate to Trump.  Putin did that with the Russian Orthodox Church. He revived it, as a unit of the government, with [a high patriarch who reports to Putin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Kirill_of_Moscow) That's been very successful for him and for the church.  With this scheme, Trump will be able to cut off funding for churches that oppose him. Christians should be careful of accepting Government support. It comes with a price tag. Trump has lashed out at religious leaders before, but he didn't have any authority over them. Soon, he will.  *""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" -* Henry II",Animats,2025-05-02T14:04:26,2

"It’s not a Religious Liberty commission, it’s a Christian Dominance Committee designed specifically to repress true freedom of religion.

"From the article:  ""In a prayer, she asked God to grant Trump “wisdom beyond human understanding and capability, and … divine dreams.”  “We call for a spiritual reset in our nation, a return to what is right, a reverence for what is sacred, a real alignment with your divine purpose,” she said.""  We can achieve the second quote through basic spirituality and not attributing it any on particular god, God, gods, etc.  The first quote is straight nuts.   Also, how come these people never believe, let alone accept, that maybe a progressive path forwards is the divine will of God?",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T17:49:13,1

I'm convinced they have their own religion. They worship him as their lord and savior. They are a cult that wants to indoctrinate us to believe in him too. If you don't believe in him you are the devil and belong in jail in a foreign prison for who knows how long. They want to ban political memes and you can be arrested if you post any.
