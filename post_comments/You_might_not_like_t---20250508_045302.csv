">""If you really love this country—and I know you do—then you must ask: what’s the plan? Because ""cut taxes and grow our way out"" hasn’t worked in 40 years. We’ve tried it.""  Well that isn't exactly true is it? During the Clinton years we had budget surplus and also under the first two years of Bush Jr. We ran a deficit under the War on Terror but in '09 it jumped a full trillion dollars. Anyone remember what happened there?  ""Cut Taxes and grow our way out"" can work, but at the same time it needs to be coupled with responsible spending. That's what been missing the last 20 years. Now we have an administration actively working to fix this for the first time in a generation, and a host of activist judges trying to put a stop to it.",Don_Alvarez,2025-05-08T07:49:46,10
Simple... cut the size of government and cut spending not from the increase they want to a lesser increase but actually cut spending from the previous years spending.  Simple.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T05:12:35,12
"Spend money only on duties enumerated in the Constitution.  I don't remember reading about the duty to fund science experiments, or disaster relief, or college funding, or the press, or job training, or foreign healthcare, etc.  Many activities have merit but are not tasked to or the responsibility of the US Federal government",lousycesspool,2025-05-08T06:15:42,8
"*Doctor doctor, how do I fix my 3000 excess calories per day problem?*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-08T13:15:58,1
We had a budget surplus during the Clinton 2nd term because Republicans in Congress led by Newt Gingrich cut taxes and reformed work requirements for welfare spending.  The solution isn't about spending less but growing spending more slowly than revenue is growing. If we grow at 3% revenue will naturally grow. However if we grow spending 4% which we typically do we still grow the deficit. If we grew spending at 1% but grew the econmy at 3% we could balance the budget in 10 years and begin to pay down the debt without raising taxes and without cutting spending.,StedeBonnet1,2025-05-08T09:05:05,5
Roll back everything 1% every year until the debt is on a sustainable downturn and then freeze spending.,Cakeinthebreakroom,2025-05-08T10:04:13,3
"This. Even though I think the federal government may be justified in funding at least some of those things some of the time, it certainly needs to close the tap when it's financially overextended.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-08T07:00:53,7
"If doctor was US Debt: ""Eat 6000 excess calories a day, then 3000 won't seem like a whole lot. After you've done that, reduce yourself to 5000 excess calories, and brag to everyone about how you've reduced your intake.""",Don_Alvarez,2025-05-08T14:32:22,2
That sounds reasonable and doable... but we are talking government... they can't do anything that way.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T10:31:22,4
I know. If one party did it the other party would complain and then undo it in order to win votes.,Cakeinthebreakroom,2025-05-08T10:35:43,6
