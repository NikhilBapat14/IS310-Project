It takes the awesome power of the federal government and turns it into a crude weapon, wielded by a man who wants to be a king.""    ...

"As long as there's a Republican in the White House, there will be a sharply divided legislature; he'll make sure of it. He wants Congress to be divided because the last thing he wants is for the two sides to comprise and unite — the GOP may just realize they've been on the wrong side of history.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T01:32:41,5
