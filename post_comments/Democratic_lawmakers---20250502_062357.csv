And of course there are the questions: is this feasible and is it going to start another nuclear arms race?,DrThomasBuro,2025-05-02T06:25:52,13
"Quote: A group of 42 Democratic lawmakers has called for a review of Elon Musk's role in the bidding process for the ""Golden Dome"" missile defense shield, a project championed by President Donald [Trump.In](http://Trump.In) a [letter, opens new tab](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_from_senator_warren_repcasartodepartmentofdefenseinspectorgeneralongoldendomeinvestigation.pdf) dated May 1 and sent to the acting US Defense Department Inspector General seen by Reuters, the group, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and congressman Greg Casar, requested a probe into the origins of the procurement process, citing concerns over the involvement of Elon Musk's SpaceX.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-02T06:24:42,5
"Ah, a review, how quaint.   Bullshit like this is why the Dems aren’t winning elections. Have a fucking stance yall. We don’t need a review to know that anything Elon has his dirty hands on is bad.   McConnell et al blocked Obama on everything for years. Dems need to take a fecking page out of that book.",loud-oranges,2025-05-02T06:43:28,8

Why not call it the Goldeneye defense system. Such a missed opportunity.,ioncloud9,2025-05-02T21:08:02,1
"I would say No to both questions, mostly due to the incompetence present in anything these people try to manage.   However, the war in Ukraine has showed that in any neer-peer conflict, we just straight up don't have enough magazine depth for our ground based air defense for any interceptor type. So if this initiative solves that issue and creates skilled jobs to do it, as well as catch-up with our European partners in development, let him slap a golden sharpie signature on every damn piece of it, and tell him it's biggly good and Xi is pissing himself",freeride732,2025-05-02T11:11:17,1
