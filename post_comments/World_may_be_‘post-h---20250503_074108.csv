"Or perhaps not.   Whether or not you survive a major viral infection has very little to do with genetics. There are some fairly minor genetic affects on how the immune system handles viruses, but it is massively out weighted by what the virus is and whether the person has built up immunity and antibodies.   For instance, smallpox and other European diseases didn't wipe out over 90% of Native Americans because 90% of Native Americans were ""genetically fragile"" -- in fact, they were on average significantly stronger and healthier than Europeans because they tended not to grow up ravaged by plagues and stunted by malnutrition as much as the people of Europe at that time. If you want to see just how feeble diet and general health alone are in combatting diseases, history gives you a pretty good example right there.  This idea that only ""inferior"" people die of diseases is both stupid and gross.  Also, people did *not* survive for 200,000 years while living in modern conditions without vaccines. Over 90% of that history was spent with humans living in small groups of like 100 people. Most of the rest involved like 50% of people dying before age 5 while the remainder broke their backs farming and hoping a late frost wouldn't doom them to starvation during the winter. It is only very recently that the elements of our current world and cultures came into existence, and it is only technology like vaccines that has allowed that to happen by allowing us to have this many people living this closely to each other.  Literally everything in your current life is only possible because of, among other things, vaccines. Your car, your house, your vitamin supplements, your clothes -- without the ability of people to live and work together in large numbers you will not have these things. And you can only have large groups of people working together like this because of, among other things, vaccines.",helmutye,2025-05-03T11:55:02,8

"I don't want to sound rude but this is a very weak argument.  1. We're exposed to 1000s of germs daily.  2. Vaccines trigger our immune system to produce the antibodies needed to fight that specific germ. Our immune system maintains a ""memory"" of that germ and if a future exposure occurs, it can quickly ramp up those specific antibodies. If anything, it's adding tools to our immune toolbox, not making things weaker.  3. Many of the major illnesses we face jumped from other species. Whatever germs circulating 100k years ago to nomadic humans is not comparable to the germ threats to our modern civilization.  4. Go study the estimated death rates of things like the plague. Do you really want to see something sweep through your town and kill 50% of your neighbors?  5. I'm not a doctor and you shouldn't take medical advice from the Internet. Please, write up all of your questions and concerns and speak with your doctor. They can help walk you through these concerns.",extremenachos,2025-05-03T13:16:47,4

"You don't die from childhood diseases because you're weak, friend. This isn't Sparta from the movie 300 -- people die from childhood diseases because they get infected with viruses and don't have sufficient acquired immunity to them. It has very little to do with genetics, and in a world without vaccines and advanced treatments whether an individual lives or dies is mostly luck -- do you happen to get exposed to something during the time when you don't have acquired immunity to it?  Maybe you get lucky and avoid the more dangerous strains in favor of weaker ones. Maybe you get exposed when you still have sufficient protection from maternal antibodies that you survive and make your own. But maybe not.  It has nothing to do with your worthiness or merit.  And that is the real problem, because when you randomly lose about half of the people who exist you lose a lot of geniuses. You lose a lot of people who would have grown up to be *very* strong, and smart, and able to add a lot of prosperity to the world. And you just lose a lot of regular people with regular talents that are just as important to our prosperity as those with talents we recognize individually.  The greatest wealth of humanity is humans. And the thing that makes us all poorest is disregard for this and willingness to turn a blind eye to mass death and human suffering.",helmutye,2025-05-03T12:01:43,22
