"Oh wow, there's [an article linked to within this one](https://theconversation.com/beatings-overcrowding-and-food-deprivation-us-deportees-face-distressing-human-rights-conditions-in-el-salvadors-mega-prison-250739) that describes the horrific conditions in El Salvador's prisons, to which the US is deporting people without due process:  >Incarcerated Salvadorans are [packed into grossly overcrowded cells](https://cristosal.org/EN/2024/07/10/silence-is-not-an-option-executive-summary/), beaten regularly by prison personnel and denied medicines even when they are available. Inmates are frequently subjected to punishments including food deprivation and electric shocks. Indeed, a U.S. State Department’s 2023 country report on El Salvador [noted the](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/528267_EL-SALVADOR-2023-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf) “harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.”  >The human rights organization Cristosal [estimates that hundreds have died](https://cristosal.org/EN/2024/07/10/silence-is-not-an-option-executive-summary/) from malnutrition, blunt force trauma, strangulation and lack of lifesaving medical treatment.  >Often, their bodies are buried by government workers in [mass graves](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2023/02/26/cuatro-de-los-detenidos-bajo-el-regimen-de-excepcion-de-bukele-en-el-salvador-aparecieron-muertos-en-una-fosa-comun/) without notifying families.  It's already bad enough that El Salvador is doing this. Now the US is participating in it!  Anyone in the US can be sent to a Salvadoran prison like this. No one is safe. If the government accuses you of being a gang member, illegal immigrant, terrorist supporter, etc, they can ""disappear"" you into one of these prisons without due process. It doesn't matter that the accusations are false. Without due process, you won't get a chance to prove your innocence.",sachiprecious,2025-04-07T19:45:44,1
"I know the SAT protest was considered a success. I realize there are more protests planned for the 15th. But we as a populace absolutely can’t sit back and feel like anything is accomplished yet. We need more, and more people. This whole administration and anyone who agrees with this stuff is absolutely an enemy of democracy. It’s now or never. Our ability to fight this is gonna rapidly diminish by the day",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-04-07T20:15:07,1
">Donald Trump’s newly confirmed solicitor general, John Sauer, is openly asking the justices to affirm the government’s right to establish a black site in El Salvador to which any individual may be renditioned without legal recourse. Once there, they are subject to indefinite detention, hard labor, torture, and death.  One of the same guys who worked on Trumps SCOTUS case. You know, the one that affirmed that yes the President can crime with zero repercusssions.  RIP USA",Probable_Bison,2025-04-07T20:50:33,1

"What makes a protest a ""success?""  Honest question.   In a fascist regime, against an authoritarian...showing, and catharsis aren't ""success.""   The administration doesn't care about its popularity.   This was a fascist take over, and people don't realize it, yet.   Waving some signs on the weekend, which is good for people to show up, isn't creating change...yet.   Snarky signs, and going home within the parameters of when you're supposed to be there...on weekend....not disrupting major commerce, or anything else isn't going to change anything.   No rights have been won by the simple act of snarky signs a few hours on the weekend.   Where are thee demands?   Where is the leadership?   What are the stakes?   If things don't change, what exactly will happen? People will get another permit, and show up next month for a few hours?   It's good for people to wake up, but we need way more to be happening...yesterday. Mass civil disobedience, mass targeted boycotts, strikes where applicable. If protesting is going to be used to *do* something it needs demands, it needs to be sustained, and it needs to disrupt capital.   Trump, and the GOP don't give a fuck about public opinion. Our memories seem to be short in this country...but, this time there's no one to stop him  >[Troops sent to DC during George Floyd protests had bayonets, top general says](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/us-troops-george-floyd-protest-bayonets-washington-dc)  This is going to get way worse, my friend...and, it may not get better.   The best time to do something was November 5th.   We've already spent too much time leaderless, with no plan. People are looking to a cowardly, ineffective, and useless democratic party for leadership, and it ain't there. Even the shit Bernie, and AOC are doing...they're campaigning...not organizing a resistance. It's just overgeneralized talking points, with no calls to action.   People showing up is great...that's more than they did for the elections...protests need to be constant, in one form, or another.   Americans don't know how to fight. We don't know how to stand together. We didn't learn from history...not even over the last decade. We *have* a rich history of defiant political and social movements clawing for rights.   We really need for these protests to create social and economic measures to fight fascism.",MagicalUnicornFart,2025-04-07T20:53:33,1
"He just made a statement yesterday about wanting to send American citizens to El Salvador prisons. [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jthbzx/donald\_trump\_says\_he\_loves\_idea\_of\_sending/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jthbzx/donald_trump_says_he_loves_idea_of_sending/)  He says ""I don't know what the law says on that,"" but honestly, who cares what the law says? The Supreme Court said that a president has immunity for ""official acts."" trump doesn't have to follow laws as long as he's doing things that are ""official.""  He's going to deport citizens and frame it like he did here: These citizens being deported are supposedly bad people who push people in subways and run people over in cars. Those are the accusations he'll make, but like I said, the government can simply make up false accusations against anyone it doesn't like (just like it falsely accused people of being gang members based on tattoos that did not prove gang membership).",sachiprecious,2025-04-07T20:05:19,1
