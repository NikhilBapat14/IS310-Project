"Snippets:  * A mother and her three children were released from ICE detention Monday, after they were detained during an immigration raid in Sackets Harbor, New York, late last month. * Public outrage has overtaken the tiny town—which also happens to be border czar Tom Homan’s hometown—after a woman and three children, grades three, 10, and 11, were among seven individuals detained during a March 27 raid on a large dairy farm. * “They lived in a house on the same road as a house that ICE had a warrant for. The fact that ICE went to their door is unfathomable. The fact that our students were handcuffed and put into the same van as the alleged criminal from down the street is unconscionable,” Cook wrote. * The arrests sparked outrage across Central and Northern New York. Nearly [1,000 people](https://www.wrvo.org/2025-04-07/sackets-harbor-family-detained-by-ice-is-returning-home) gathered in Sackets Harbor on Saturday to protest the family’s detention by ICE. The population of Sackets Harbor is roughly [1,350 people](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/sackets-harbor-ny). * The family was released from custody on Monday, according to a [statement](https://x.com/NoahHurowitz/status/1909317414514573473) from Jennifer Gaffney, the superintendent of the Sackets Harbor Central School District.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-07T18:03:21,1
We need to impeach Trump and get rid of all of these lunatics immediately.,sydneebmusic,2025-04-07T18:55:45,1
This is a small town in a rural county that Trump won by 23 points.  And I was looking at the photos and at least one guy had Hands Off sign he made.  And they didn't look much like bougie wine moms and hipsters on their way to brunch.,I_who_have_no_need,2025-04-07T20:57:41,1
