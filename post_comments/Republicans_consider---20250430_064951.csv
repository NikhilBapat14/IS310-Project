The proposal is to slash Medicaid. Stop dressing it up with soft ass headlines.,gradientz,2025-04-30T07:20:07,12
Say what it actually is: **Republicans are trying to cut Medicaid.**  “And nobody would be kicked off Medicaid as long as the governors decided that they want to continue to fund the program. And so we are going to ask the states to pick up and pay some additional percentage of Medicaid.”,SirStocksAlott,2025-04-30T07:20:13,8
The Republicans never give up trying to get rid of Obamacare. If Trump and the GOP really cared about regular people they would enact universal health care in this country. We are the only modern country where people die for lack of medical coverage and people go deep into debt to pay for it. All of these cuts are made with the goal of renewing big tax cuts for the rich instead of getting the rich to pay their fair share.,joekerr9999,2025-04-30T06:56:13,5

"Can’t be letting tax $ be spent on the population now. They’re much prefer that some insurance company make billions in profit than have a program paid for by the people, actually help the people, right",togocann49,2025-04-30T08:30:36,1
People on Medicaid don’t seem to care.  It’s one reason I gave up my sponsorship of some medical services.  The people needing the services would vote against political leaders who could help.  So I figured they don’t need me too.,bonzoboy2000,2025-04-30T08:25:53,-1
"They are trying to specifically cut Medicaid, but they are using the Obamacare term to obfuscate that.",SirStocksAlott,2025-04-30T07:21:36,3
