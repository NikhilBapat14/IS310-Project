One of the most obvious jobs that can be done remotely. Just plop down in front of your auditor software and plow through cases. Doesn't require a lot of coordination or planning. Whatever work they couldn't do remotely probably had to occur in person not at HQs but at the place of business they're auditing.   Hell if anything we should be replacing 90%+ of the IRS with automation but until then they could work from almost anywhere.,ngoni,2025-04-18T17:44:13,160

I don't give a shit if they are at a desk at an office building or at their house as long as they are working. This boomer mentality that a computer/desk job HAS to be in an office is so cringe and the worst part is they are normally the one walking around gossiping and not working. THAT is the real reason they want in person so they can justify their own job.,hillmon,2025-04-18T21:37:53,42
"[Despite funding boost, IRS still grapples with backlogs and identity theft, watchdog warns](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/despite-funding-boost-irs-still-grapples-with-backlogs-and-identity-theft-watchdog-warns)  This is from Jan 24, and from PBS for the brigaders.

"Story time.   My sister works for the government she works HR But I don't exactly want to say which agency. She is Republican she voted for Trump and she likes most of what he's doing but she's definitely worried about being downsized because there's no certainty in anything she does a good job she's well liked and well needed in her position. And so far she's been just fine.   We were talking about what's going on, And she told me that the government views your job as a federal employee basically as a right once you are out of your probationary period It is very very hard to be let go even if you are basically terrible. She had done some work for FEMA at one point and talked about how it was the most dysfunctional job she had ever seen but now where she's at she feels like it's much more important and people are efficient and actually do their jobs and that's fine.

"It's bonkers that people don't get this. A lot of household chores require only a minute or two of human interaction, but the machine itself takes hours. Laundry and dishes come to mind.  I work half time remote half in the office. I can get like 4 loads of laundry done on a work from home day and I'm only actually spending maybe 10 minutes away from my computer. The beauty of this is, if my employer REALLY is upset about those 10 minutes, I can log off at 5:10 instead of 5:00. But in practice, they aren't, or at least can't really claim to be, considering that the work day is full of little bathroom breaks, coffee breaks, and for some people, smoke breaks even when in the office.  Same amount of work gets done for my employer, but I also get work done around the house. So I can log off at 5:00 (or 5:10 if my boss REALLY wanted to be that way) and immediately start on folding that laundry, and I'm still ready to sit down and eat dinner with my family by 6.  Compare to being in the office, I'd leave at 5, get home at 5:30 and only then could I even start that first load. So the same amount of laundry will take me until midnight. In both situations, the company gets the same amount of work done, but in one of those situations I get vastly more free time and can go to bed earlier and have a clearer head for tomorrow's work.  A month's worth of me taking 2 minutes to load the clothes washer every now and then doesn't even add up to one in-office smoke break, and yet that's a normal and accepted part of work culture.",homestar92,2025-04-18T12:25:34,85
