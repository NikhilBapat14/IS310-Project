"NGL, he's moving WAY faster than historical Fascists that used politics to gain power (as opposed to violence to gain power) have moved in the past.  He's attempting to make absolute power grabs without having properly consolidated all the needed power structure systems in place to prevent the other branches of Government from stopping him (for now). His arrests of those judges show that he's learning how to deal with the ""checks and balances"" blocks to achieving his goals. Its slap dash Fascism and he know he's got until Jan 3rd 2027 to fully consolidate power before he gets impeached again. With how much political capital he is burning, he not just burning his own Capital at this point, it's the collective Political Capital of the GOP. Using it all risks adjacent Republicans in the Senate getting burned and voted out, or just siding against him, enough risk I think that the upcoming impeachment might be the first ever to find a POTUS guilty in the Senate if he becomes too unpopular and enough of his allies get voted out.

"Dude. Moderates are astoundingly okay with fascism so long as they don't have to deal with the slight discomfort of progress.¬†   Like they'd rather watch trans people be marched off to concentration camps than have to learn and use new pronouns out of simple respect for their fellow human beings.¬†   Not even fucking joking.¬†   Or as Dr King put it:I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen‚Äôs Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äúorder‚Äù than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action‚Äù; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man‚Äôs freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ‚Äúmore convenient season.‚Äù Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.  I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.  In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn‚Äôt this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God‚Äôs will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. ¬†",Ok-disaster2022,2025-04-28T09:02:38,207

"It's too many people who've been mainlining the story of American exceptionalism their whole life. It infects every perception people have of America's status, as well as their views of its past and their predictions for its future. It leads way too many people to think ""It can't happen here"", as if America has a magic spell cast on it that will stop ""*true* fascists"", or at least limit their reach and impact.  I've spent near on the last decade being worried about this kind of fascism, because it was obvious what kind of person Trump is even back in 2016. But people acted like I was the crazy one that was overreacting. I even moved away from the US in the first Trump administration, because I figured shit would only get worse.  And even with that, I still found myself after the 2020 election that maybe America had gotten slightly less insane (and then I thought about the numbers and realized it was closer than the 2016 election). And even after Trump got elected last year, I don't know that I would've expected things to move *this* fast. I expected things to be stretched out over at least 2 years, if not 4, just so that the average person wouldn't get whiplash.

"> One element shared by all fascist movements, racialist or not, is the apparent lack of consistent political principle behind the ideology¬≠ political opportunism in the most basic sense. One virtually unique aspect of fascism is its ruthless drive to attain and hold state power. On that road to power, fascists are willing to abandon any principle to adopt an issue more in vogue and more likely to gain converts.  This could not be more wrong. Look back through history and find countless examples of people holding on to power at any cost, abusing and corrupting the system for their own enrichment or empowerment. You'll see cut throat politics, Machiavellian schemes (I wonder where that name came from).  On top of this, it's wrong because it doesn't go far enough. Fascists don't simply want state power. They want power over *everything*. To paraphrase Mussolini: everything for the state, everything inside the state, nothing outside the state! It's totalitarian. It's not content with simply acquiring state power. That would be your bog-standard authoritarianism, which shows up everywhere yet doesn't turn into fascism, for what should be obvious reasons.  And as I said, which ideology *hasn't* had ruthless conquerors from the ancient kings of Assyria to Genghis Khan, to Mohammed, to Napoleon, or King Leopold. Or hasn't had mass movements which are incoherent or vacuous of internal logic and ideologically inconsistent? Such as, any given religious movement? Any theocracy? Any communist regime?

"I don't think Harris was a terrible candidate. I think voters wanted Trump back because he is a dictator and misogynist. It wouldn't have mattered if you put Bernie or Obama or Jesus or whomever in her place. Idk why progressives think they are the majority in this country, when really the majority is ignorant people who want to beat up on whomever they feel has grieved them most. Trump plays to that crowd well, and there probably wasn't much Dems could do to correct that.  I'd also say that MAGA would not vote for a woman version of Trump. We already had that, her name was Palin, and she lost. But really it's more to the ethos of the Republican party. They absolutely cannot accept a woman as their leader, whether it's MTG, Ann Coulter, Kristi Noem, or any other dozens of conservative women you can point to. It's in their DNA as a party to treat women as second class citizens who should stay at home and raise children. And yes, plenty of women will still vote for a misogynist, either because they don't see it or because they think other things are more important.

Clinton had an FBI investigation on her spilling classified secrets over email, and she was run through the coals for it over and over again.

">This, just like all the other comments I've been responding to, boils down to blaming literally everything except the DNC again.  That's not what I'm saying. Even if the DNC ran a perfect campaign, they were still likely to lose this election. Too much of their base is split on key issues, and moreover they are not the majority like I said.  I read your link as to why she was a bad candidate, and it does a poor job of making your case. It doesn't actually list any like polling data or ways she could have handled situations better, just makes opinionated guesses as to what might have worked differently then the strategies her team chose. That's barely even a diagnosis and more just someone complaining about how their side lost.   As I said, I already believe she wasn't a terrible candidate. Nevertheless if she had been a man, she would have performed better. Still lost, but almost certainly had better margins. People wanted Trump, irrelevant of the DNC candidate, and that fact appears very much lost on you.  >Continuing to perform mental gymnastics in order to craft some complex narrative about why that isn't the case is only going to further dillute support for the DNC. People are able to read and hear things.  It's a complex narrative to say our country wanted a dictatorship who's misogynist? I think you and I have different definitions of the word complex. The DNC has its issues, sure, as does every institution. But there's no getting around that people wanted Trump more than they didn't want him. I'm still going to support many liberal/progressive policies, but I'm not under the delusion that a majority of voters agree with me.   >Trump is not acting alone.  True, but he is absolutely the head of the snake. Without him, the whole thing fractures. Sure, others will try to unite his coalition when he's gone, and someone may even succeed, especially if he's in power for longer than two terms. But odds are they can't and there is a bunch of infighting. Republicans will coalesce around someone new, but it probably won't be with the same enthusiasm. At least that's my hope at this point.  >If the heritage foundation and other legacy-money assholes pushed an MTG lady instead it would still work.   Absolutely going to disagree with you here. Republicans don't like women, period. It's why they elect so few of them to begin with. Also, [Nikki Haley had mega donors supporting her, such as the Koch's,](https://fortune.com/2024/03/06/nikki-haley-suspends-campaign-super-tuesday-republican-party-donors-ken-griffin-koch-brothers/) and she still lost the primary. So the evidence is against your conclusion.  >The only reason any of those women you listed are in power is because they hate liberals and the left MORE than they hate women; they love manipulatable idiot women.  Sure, I agree that GOP representative women manipulate their voters. But that doesn't mean those voters aren't open to voting against their own rights and interests.  >Plus, there are women presidents in the world, Mexico just voted one in.  Yep, great for the world, but that's not the US. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't elect a women to the presidency for another 50 years. Yes, we are that ingrained in our misogyny.  >Apparently, healthcare, immigrant rights, the environment, lgbtq rights, racial justice, a livable wage, and opposition to genocide are all no longer democrat issues and just ""progressive"" ones.  I don't know where you got any of that from the discussion. Parts of the Dems want those things, but parts think they are less important than other issues. But the fracturing Democratic base over key issues is not my point. Even if you united Dems together (call them progressive or whatever), they would still lose to the voting block of ""screw you, I only care about me"" that is more popular in this country right now. So it doesn't matter how much we appeal to their interests or their sympathy or their beliefs in a better tomorrow. All they care about is that ""we"" (liberals) suffer more than they are suffering, in whatever form that takes. And that is the majority in this country.   >If those things don't matter to enough people and ""the rest of the people are too stupid to ever vote left"", I'm not even sure what case you're trying to make here. ""No one should try to do anything other than leave the country"" is where that goes, I guess.  Yeah, maybe. I don't think this country can be saved just by trying to convince/bully people online, that's for sure. We've tried that for 10 years now, and it hasn't worked. Idk if there is another way to do it. Maybe let the country collapse under GOP incompetence? Or honestly maybe it's redo the whole system and then fight for a better one.  I don't think Democrats have fully realized that, irrelevant of what they do, MAGA has installed a dictatorship in effect if not in name. That is absolutely what Trump is doing, consolidating power, reducing opposition, locking up voices that speak out against him, etc. And the only check even remotely close to this is the Courts, which are effective only some of the time and only when he seems to listen to them. But Congress has abandoned any means of a check, and the various executive branches are being purged of anyone disloyal. Civil institutions, like colleges and newspapers and law firms, are being forced to bend the knee, and most have done so willingly for fear of the consequences. I don't know how someone can see this and say we need to fight through the normal channels of resistance, because they don't care about those and/or are dismantling them.  And I can't stress this enough, but this is what the majority of this country wanted. They are cheering Trump in the streets so long as they aren't directly impacted by it (and then they delude themselves that it's just a mistake that they were impacted, rather than the point). People clinging to the idea that they can change enough minds are kidding themselves. It's too late, the cat is out of the bag, even if they could change minds. Other means are needed to stop this, and I don't see anyone really acknowledging how dire the situation is or what real steps need to be taken. Some rallies on weekends isn't going to cut it. Relying on waiting it out two-to-four years for the next election isn't going to cut it. Going to the courts is not going to cut it at some point, because they will just ignore them, or rewrite laws they don't like (without Congress input or anything).   So again to your question, yeah maybe leaving the country is the best option. Or, what probably most people will do, which is just let it happen. Maybe then we'll realize how massively we messed up and correct ourselves. Or we'll just be forever in this new reality, a la Russia and China, etc, where there is only one party/one person rule.

Because like...think through the logistics of American military power occupying Canada. It might be more insane than ""US sets off nuclear war in the Middle East."" Canada is bigger geographically than the US. Its provinces are massive, climate hostile to those unprepared, and there are countless places a resistance could hole up.

It's so frustrating, because with some basic strategic awareness from our party, none of us would be in this clusterfuck.
