He just said yesterday if we tax rich people more they will leave.,Demonofthedark1313,2025-04-25T11:01:48,10
Says the man who's deferred his Federal Taxes for at least the last two decades.     Anything he says is bullshit.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-25T11:02:12,9
"""trump lies and says as a rich person he wouldn't mind paying taxes-despite public brags  about not paying taxes and overwhelming evidence that he does not"".  I hate this timeline.  The motherfucker is taking a blowtorch to our Democracy and every institution but the media still treats him with kid gloves because they are afraid of hurting his feelings.  Go right at this motherfucker and stop mincing words.  Playing nice isnt going to keep you out of the gulag, its just going to make it easier for them to send you there.",StashedandPainless,2025-04-25T11:03:45,4

Yes he would. This is lying doublespeak from a failing president to try and appeal to the american people after every single action taken so far punishes the average american in favor of the extremely wealthy.,[deleted],2025-04-25T11:03:51,1
"In the same way that he’ll release his taxes any day now, they’re just “under audit”. It’s a cheap lie since he knows there’s absolutely no chance of it happening.",Devilnaht,2025-04-25T11:08:49,1
