The guy exposed his true identity when he did business with the Genovese crime family while doing construction in New York.  It all goes downhill from there.,I405CA,2025-04-27T18:58:49,20

Just wait till his 4th year. This will all seem like nothing.,TheWorldBeyond11,2025-04-27T18:55:11,33
From the beginning of him gaining his first presidency in 2016 he would venerate dictators in hopes he too could have that level of power yet his loyal sycophants continued to be okay with it and have once again returned him back into the White House.  I hope even his followers realize we don't have to agree on everything but giving up your freedom is something we should not ever give away.,Thund3rbolt,2025-04-27T19:00:33,10
"Americans voted Trump into power, **twice**. And to be fair, Trump has been pretty open about his priorities, his politics, his attitudes, throughout the campaign trail. And the American people still supported Trump.   So maybe Ukraine has exposed **America's** true identity.",xibeno9261,2025-04-27T21:40:48,14
"That photo of the two putin puppets both making the exact same gesture at Zelensky is just hilarious... and pathetic.  Anyway, this is an excellent piece that isn't just about Ukraine but about trump's authoritarian leadership in general. Great read.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T19:04:16,6

In his 1990 *Playboy* interview he praised the Chinese government for massacring pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  He has never hidden what he is. He's been openly corrupt and immoral his entire adult life. A lot of Americans are just too stupid to realize just how bad dictatorships are for everyone who has to live in them.,VanceKelley,2025-04-28T00:00:44,5
"Trump exposes himself every day.    We don't need another revelation to make it obvious, because it can't get more obvious. People just refuse to believe it, or find ways to justify it.",lordagr,2025-04-27T18:59:33,5

Trump's identity was never hidden,HopeFloatsFoward,2025-04-28T06:40:22,3
I genuinely think Trump has dementia and fully bought into Putin's compliments instead of wanting to be authoritarian.   He might not even know what authoritarianism means. He might just like having Supreme control like a businessman. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't identify that as being tyrannical.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-04-27T22:30:34,2

He’s a narcissist. He doesn’t care about the USA LIBS conservatives Green Party blacks whites Asians druggies wealthy golfers in Palm Springs with a net worth of 15 million…screw you too… You need close to 80 billion before he will give audience.  He doesn’t - care about gangsters.. he thinks dem idiots..all he cares about is the military support…that’s the end game here. USA military vs the USA Supreme Court. Then the rubber hits….the road,trastamara22,2025-04-28T02:09:03,1

"Trump's narcissism has been well established long before The Art of The Deal. His father conditioned him to believe he was indestructable, and so far, like his father, he's pretty much shown zero ability to feel remorse, empathy, or anything that comes close to a moral compass.",TheFutureIsAFriend,2025-04-27T23:42:13,4
