"It’s not supposed to make sense: a) they have no idea how to govern, and b) they want to hide the grift of this administration and their party.",rogue203,2025-05-10T06:20:30,57
"Honestly, their budget plans always just look like random cuts and tax breaks with no real logic. It’s like they just want to say they’re saving money but don’t care what actually gets affected. I don’t get how anyone thinks it adds up.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-10T06:20:09,30
"And you expected what, exactly?  They say that government doesn't work and that they want to destroy most of it. Their leader says he'll be a dictator and they cheer him on. Said leader has a long history of fraud, financial mismanagement, scams and assorted criminality. Scammers and crooks fund their campaigns. Their supporters are a fascist death cult. Their main campaign promises entail destroying foreign trade, the labour market, the USA's network of alliances and treaties, the rule of law, ...  It would be a miracle if their budgets did make sense. Insinuating that it could conceivably make sense is normalizing the abnormal, the immoral and the outright criminal.",barryvm,2025-05-10T06:38:42,18

The republican budget makes sense if you acknowledge it is guided by corruption and billionaires who have no regard for the well being of the general public.,rapidcreek409,2025-05-10T07:38:46,6
They are stealing from average and poor Americans to give to the ultra wealthy.  It will never make sense.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-10T08:42:52,5

It's just a troll. it's meant to dismantle the country and hurt Americans. It doesn't make sense in the context of good governance or serving the needs and interests of the American people,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-10T08:06:46,4

"The billionaires getting richer while the debt goes up is the biggest grift of them all.  Republicans the biggest offenders here.   They blow up the deficit and enrich billionaires the most.   Through inflation from printing money to pay out the treasuries sold, it’s a direct transfer of money from your pocket to billionaires pockets.   A hidden tax that goes directly from your pocket to Elon musks, bill gates, Jeff bezos etc.     Billionaires need to be made poorer and the debt must go down .  The wealth of the billionaires must be returned from the people it was stolen from. Their wealth and assets should be seized and mechanisms put in place to prevent such concentration and influence.",No-Problem49,2025-05-10T09:24:53,1

I'm not even going to bother reading that article. I don't need 3000 words of creative elocution to instinctively understand that the Republicans budget makes no fucking sense. Their budgets have _never_ made fucking sense. There are precisely zero intelligent people on the face of the earth who wonder if _now_ - **of all times** - they would propose a budget that made fucking sense.,FredUpWithIt,2025-05-10T13:38:35,1
It makes perfect sense if you look at it as the Republicans are evil and trying to hurt the most needy and vulnerable. ,GeologistOriginal800,2025-05-10T15:40:59,1

You can look up what the us government spends by year though and see how often republicans lowered yearly spending since 1980.  Interesting to see that the small government republicans had that occur 0 of the 24 years they held the presidency.  So that means there is finally some room for tax cuts. /s,Dangerous-Sport-2347,2025-05-10T06:44:19,22
"Exactly. Eliminate USAID so that's basically $1 savings on a bill for $10,000 bill, proportionately. But then give massive tax breaks to the wealthy so now the bill went from $9,999 to $15,000. ",Sad_Pangolin7379,2025-05-10T08:41:45,20

"The budget is also guided by hate and vengeance. I'm sure if you look close enough, you'll see that blue states suffer the most cuts, while the GOP has been clawing back as much funding and programs as they can for their red states.",drewba2ba2,2025-05-10T11:17:21,1
