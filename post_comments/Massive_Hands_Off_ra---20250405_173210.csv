"I really, truly hope Donny and Elon see the vids and photos of these masses and squirm. I spotted a few “France circa 1798” signs today too, and these billionaire fucks are walking a thin line.",borkborkbork99,2025-04-05T19:49:45,23

"I had to hold back tears when I arrived at a protest in my area.  I was overwhelmed with emotion.  Proud to see so many people gathering to stand for our country, our democracy our constitution, our rights.   Sad that we are at a place in history that calls for it.   Countries in Europe held protest today in solidarity with us.  Peace to all!",Chipfullyinserted,2025-04-05T19:25:28,20
"I teared up.   I was at the one in Boise ID, but my home state of WV... Well it's always let me down. I've had such a bad experience with the people, the politics, the law. Then to see people, actually standing up and fighting for what is right there. Fuck. Thank you.",Geist_Mage,2025-04-05T23:32:54,9

"I heard on NPR today that we aren’t seeing the same mass protests we saw during his first term so Americans apparently aren’t too worried  They got one thing wrong, they’re even bigger this time, they just don’t want us to see them so they can pretend we aren’t worried while their coffers get ever fatter and our stomachs get ever emptier",nofacetheghostx,2025-04-05T20:50:01,41

It’s crazy to see conservatives aka Trump cultists trying to say these protests are dumb and a waste of time after they defended the Jan6ers. They are the biggest hypocrites of all. I honestly think it bugs and scares them a little to see so many people angry ,Fluffy_Monk777,2025-04-05T22:01:07,18

"There was an article about this. It is actually the opposite. In 2017 there were big ones that dominated the headlines, IE woman’s march. This time they are smaller in size, but more widely spread and happening more often.  The media in their fear are not covering it as they should.  “These demonstrations, the piece said, “may not look like the mass marches of 2017, but research shows they are far more numerous and frequent—while also shifting to more powerful forms of resistance.””  https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/03/resistance-alive-well-us/",TUGO_12528,2025-04-05T21:07:28,36

"If tarrifs really do affect prices, drive inflation up and require an act of faith to believe the boom times are"".juuuuuuust.....around the corner....any day now.."" then expect these protests to intensify and grow in size.

"The CEO made  $400,000 a year in base compensation in 2020, probably much closer to $1m/yr now after COL increases. NPR may not have fat coffers, but its leaderships are much fatter than most",nofacetheghostx,2025-04-10T12:20:18,1
