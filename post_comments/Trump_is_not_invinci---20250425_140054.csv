"I think many if not most people get the slippery slope of dismissing due process, even for probable criminals (ironically, including Trump…).  The Trump quote of ”we don’t have time” is stunning.",Cheetotiki,2025-04-25T14:07:55,34

Well he’s arrested two judges today and all judges and democrats want to do is issue strongly worded statements. We will never beat Trump if we don’t have the balls to arrest him or his cronies,CoachCrunch12,2025-04-25T14:20:57,20

"Trump folded so many times already.  Anyone who thinks he's invincible is not paying attention.  He operates using fear.  He wants to scare people into accepting tyranny.  When we resist, he folds, just like any other bully.",The-M0untain,2025-04-25T15:06:13,17
"Trump will come and go. Everyone needs to look at who represents their state. They are the ones who could literally stop all of this. What is Trump and felon gonna primary every single person who said trump is bad? At least vote them out. I’m old enough to remember when the two parties use to work together for the ball to keep moving forward. I’m in Florida, it’s a struggle. But Jacksonville got a democratic mayor. And she’s a woman! There is hope, but you gotta work for it!",nopulsehere,2025-04-25T14:32:16,11

If perhaps the Banks lose enough something something MIGHT maybe possibly Jamie Dimon et al. will shift their priorities to the betterment of consumers instead of the corporate elite but mumble mumble they won’t cause they’re all in on Trump solidifying the Tax Cuts before they show any sort of interest.

"Good to raise the alarm before even if it never happens. If it happens, too late. The signs are all here now, except to the naive. There is a pattern of pushing boundaries and looking for preemptive compliance.   It is obvious. I’m surprised our institutions have held up at all. So not hopeless.",real-username-tbd,2025-04-25T17:20:24,2
"""I’m surprised our institutions have held up at all. So not hopeless.""  I hear you but also take into consideration that the old guard, the 4 star Generals and Admirals, the senior folks at the CIA, FBI and all the other 3 letter agencies have been nonpartisan doing their jobs really well since the 90s or early 2000s. They've seen multiple administration changes and they are NOT about to go kamikaze to impress Trump.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T17:33:20,2
