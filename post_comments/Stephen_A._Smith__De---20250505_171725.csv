Stephen A. Smith should purge himself of any delusions he may have about being a political actor.,cjwidd,2025-05-05T17:19:53,65
No one wants you to run.,Ianthin1,2025-05-05T17:20:56,33
"What a wimp. He says it needs purging, but wonâ€™t say who needs to go. Thanks for the nothing sandwich, dude.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-05T17:20:05,25
"""I don't hate gay people enough to be a republican but I am too rich and don't want to pay taxes so I am not a democrat either.  Why is there no party for me??""  Not like anyone would vote for you anyway.  Maybe just keep talking about sports and leave politics to people who actually care about helping other people",Al_Tilly_the_Bum,2025-05-05T17:21:31,16

"Ah, so he's applying an aribitray purity test to an entire group of people.  Let's be less reasonable...  Why not the whole planet?  Why bother limiting yourself to an unreasonable request, when you can just be totally unreasonable?",Actual__Wizard,2025-05-05T17:18:51,11
"This ASSHOLE is not a Democrat -- he is calling for purging the left wing of the party as a prerequisite for his running for President.  The Democratic party has traditionally been a big tent, we don't need a mirror image of King Chump insulting the legacy of the one party which stands for inclusiveness and consensus-building.  Should the Democrats be stupid enough to nominate this Trump clone, they will lose bigly.   One more salient point -- Senator Barrack Obama was a relatively conservative (by Democratic norms) elected official when he successfully ran for President and was re-elected. He united the party and did not call for any mindless divisive purges.",Nerd-19958,2025-05-05T17:22:31,10

The right wing and left wing of the dem party should get together and organize a mitosis.  Ditch the name.  Come up with new branding for each faction.  And firmly plant a new acceptable right sill of the overton window.,KingThar,2025-05-05T17:27:06,0
