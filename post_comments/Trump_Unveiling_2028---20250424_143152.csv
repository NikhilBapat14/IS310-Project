"Wow. Interesting info.. I have found chat GPTs only purpose. 🙌  Attempting to run for a third term as president could be seen as betraying a consciousness of guilt depending on the context — especially if the individual is trying to avoid legal accountability or consequences that might follow after leaving office.  Here’s how the argument might go: 	1.	Immunity While in Office: Presidents often enjoy certain legal protections or immunities while in office. If someone aggressively tries to retain power beyond the constitutionally allowed terms, it might signal they’re trying to extend those protections. 	2.	Fear of Prosecution: If there are credible investigations or looming legal issues awaiting a former president, trying to stay in office could be interpreted as a way to avoid prosecution — suggesting they know they’ve done something wrong. 	3.	Deviation from Democratic Norms: Willingly violating constitutional term limits can be read as an act of desperation or fear — not just ambition. That fear might be tied to the consequences of stepping down. 	4.	Public Perception: Even if no charges have been filed, the act of clinging to power in violation of law might lead observers to conclude the leader believes they have something to hide — a sort of “if you’re innocent, why not step down?” reasoning.  Of course, this is largely a matter of inference — it’s not definitive proof of guilt, but a circumstantial sign that might support a larger narrative of wrongdoing.

"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Date]  To the Honorable [Representative’s Name],  I write to you not as a partisan, but as a citizen guided by the text and intent of the United States Constitution—specifically, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.  This section clearly states:      “No person shall hold any office…under the United States…who, having previously taken an oath…to support the Constitution…shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.”  On December 19, 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court found that Donald J. Trump engaged in insurrection on January 6, 2021. That ruling was not overturned. The U.S. Supreme Court’s later opinion did not dispute the insurrection finding—it only stated that enforcement must come from federal, not state, action.  Under the plain language of the Constitution, Donald J. Trump is currently disqualified from holding office. And only a two-thirds vote of Congress can remove that disability.  I urge you to acknowledge the standing ruling from Colorado on the Congressional record. This acknowledgment—formal, public, and clear—would initiate a process that demands constitutional fidelity over partisan interest. It would also place on record the constitutional requirement that any removal of this disqualification must come only by a supermajority vote.  To ignore this issue is to erode the rule of law. To act is not rebellion. It is loyalty—to the oath, to the Constitution, and to your constituents.  I ask you to stand for the integrity of our democratic process. If Section 3 of the 14th Amendment means anything, it must mean this.

I mean it is just a hard situation when you see the best of your family and the worst of everyone else  My mom is committed red and still one of the best parents I could've had and is a generally sweet woman. I get it if you're like in San Fran or something but growing up in a rural red area makes it hard to contrast people that can be loving with also having abhorrent views.

"Going into your narrative, the popular vote said otherwise. It’s those of us who still hold the constitutional ideals dear who are no longer “American.”  In truth though, this hard line stance is counterproductive. You’re making an assertion that all people who voted for Trump voted specifically for him to do what he’s doing. Many did, to be sure.  Saying “you’re evil” doesn’t change anyone’s mind, it gets them to go “I’m not evil, I don’t gotta listen to this jerk” and double down. Saying “look, we are where we are. Here is what’s happening, is this really ok with you? We gotta do something different here, right?,” gets reasonable people to at least use the head they have.  Your message won’t help defeat MAGA in special elections and the midterms.   Helping people understand the fact that if the administration can do what they’re doing, you a citizen could be on a plane to El Salvador even for, say, allegedly flirting with an ice agent’s spouse. Based on their actions, you’d get no phone call, no lawyer, no chance to prove your status, and your family MAY find out what happened to you from pictures the administration used to brag about breaking the law.   Put that way, it’s not about the past or me vs you. It’s about what do we do together. Maybe I’m optimistic, but I think people understand this shit ain’t freedom.",Free_Dimension1459,2025-04-25T07:45:49,1

It’s frustrating because Trump did literally such similar things just on the other side, but at some point we have to come to some census to actually heal this country from this tyrannical administration.",Due_Preference637,2025-04-24T22:35:31,0

"Yeah, already worked out how. https://youtu.be/UgIay64Obcs",Eye_foran_Eye,2025-04-24T22:03:45,1
"The guy has made a career out of pushing boundaries and seeing what people and institutions will let him get away with. But when it comes to a third term, as horrifyingly real as that idea sounds right now, I just don't see it happening.  The 22nd Amendment is not up for debate. It clearly states that no person can be *elected* president more than twice. It doesn’t matter how it's framed. Running again, claiming to be a write-in, trying to “test the courts”, the Constitution will block it. There's no wiggle room there.  *""But the courts will just--""* The courts already rejected his last power grab--**including his own appointees**. In 2020, Trump filed over 60 lawsuits trying to overturn the results. He lost almost all of them. Even the conservative judges ***appointed by Trump himself*** refused to play along. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Roberts...none of them. That same bench is still in place today, with the only change being Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson replacing Breyer--who was appointed by Biden. Why do people think the courts will just bow to him *now* after this disastrous run?  Unlike the sketchy 14th Amendment challenges, the 22nd Amendment is black-and-white. States could, and likely would, block him from appearing on the ballot, triggering court challenges that would get fast-tracked to the Supreme Court. And again, this isn’t some fringe legal theory. This is *basic constitutional law.* And besides, why would Republicans put all their eggs into a basket they know is going to get dropped?  Whether Trump is serious or just trolling kind of doesn’t matter in the long run. Maybe he *believes* he can get away with it. Maybe it’s just a grift to fundraise and keep his name trending. Either way, it’s irrelevant. What he thinks he can do and what is possible are not the same thing. The law doesn’t care about his intentions in this case.  Be vigilant, but don’t spiral into fear to a point of losing control. We need clear minds and cool heads to whether the storm of the next three and a half years. Trump can and will push boundaries again. But this isn’t one he can cross. The 22nd Amendment isn’t optional, and there’s no viable legal path to a third term. There's just not.

I told a MAGA in my family about this, they said:  ""And maybe look at other news outlets and see if all this stuff that comes out is true because there is a lot of media people trying to tarnish Trump but the public loves him""  So I replied by saying Trump literally said out loud and on tape that he is seriously considering this. I also brought up the coup attempt and the events leading up to it, that when taken all together presents a clear pattern of Trump being extremely power hungry and unwilling to let go of it, to which they said:  ""Ok so he wants to run again but he wont be able to. Dont get worked up on something that cannot happen.""  They simply will not believe it until the consequences are knocking at their front door.

We can't let the Constitution just be sheets of paper.",HagbardCelineHMSH,2025-04-25T22:45:14,2
"Just to be clear, I'm a bit more optimistic than my comment might let on.  You make some great points, but I think it's important to bear in mind that Trump and company *have absolutely picked a fight with the Constitution*. What they are doing isn't haphazard - they're trying to follow the [Orban Strategy](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/20/nx-s1-5338596/hungary-viktor-orban-democracy), which they have studied closely for over a decade.   Laws aren't self-executing. The Law is only as powerful as those who enforce it, and it's impossible to take refuge under ""what is supposed to happen"" when those charged with enforcing it have replaced it with their own dictates. The USSR had a Constitution, after all. As does China, as well as North Korea. Most dictatorships do, and their constitutions are full of fine-sounding platitudes much like our own. But the difference is that their governments have placed themselves over those principles, much as Trump and company are trying to do here. So saying, ""well, the Constitution forbids this!"" really isn't consolation.  But I do think they'll fail. Not because the Constitution will save us, but rather because evil breeds weakness. It takes a certain type of power-hungry individual to step behind an individual like Trump and toe his line every step of the way. Such individuals are driving by ambition and prey on weakness. And the moment Trump shows weakness, they will be at the ready to pounce like vultures and fight over the scraps and it will cripple much of what they are trying to do.  And that weakness is showing because Trump's actions are necessarily of the sort that have to be walked back because he's hurting things the base cares about. And I do think the Constitution will make it through all this, but only because it's a convenient tool for those who turn on him to grasp upon in their opposition. Trump's base itself won't turn against Republicans (people who think Republicans will cross the aisle are not living in reality), but it might turn on him personally.  And therein lies hope. But I feel hope solely because the law says they can't do what they're doing is misplaced. The whole point of openly flouting the law is to show you can.",HagbardCelineHMSH,2025-04-25T08:24:56,1

"The decision had nothing to do with the definition of insurrection. Colorado tried to keep him off the ballot as an insurrectionist. Trump and his team did not try to defend themselves against that claim. How could they?   So instead they fought it purely on the grounds that a state cannot make the decision to keep someone off the primary ballot as in insurrectionist. They lost. So they took it to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's decision did not consider whether Trump was an insurrectionist. The definition of an insurrectionist had nothing to do with it. Rather they decided no state should be able to decide to keep him off the ballot because they didn't think every state should be making the decision whether someone was an insurrectionist. And then they went further and invented a new rule out of thin air that Congress had to act to kick him off the ballot and were the only ones who could do so. In doing so, the Supreme Court failed us again and protected Trump from further challenges.  The Constitution is clear about insurrectionists being ineligible. It is not up to Congress to determine innocence or guilt when it comes to insurrection. That is responsibility of the courts. Once the courts determined Trump was an insurrectionist, as was done in CO and not appealed, he should be considered ineligible everywhere until that disability is removed by Congress or that ruling is overturned by a higher court.",loondawg,2025-04-25T07:14:01,1

Given the choice between Trump four years from now or a liberal, I see them still pulling the lever for Trump because they hate Democrats and Democratic policies *that much*. But remember that most of the people around him are ambitious people who are using him and who just toe the line because he gives them power and gets them what they want.

It's as simple as someone who isn't yet 35, or isn't a natural-born citizen.  The chicken-shit Supreme Court made up rules based on words that don't exist. Nowhere in the amendment does it say Congress must do jack shit to deem someone ineligible. It would be absurd to even think so, as it implies they would need to do the same to prevent anyone under the age of 35 from appearing on the ballot after being nominated by their party.

"While what you say is technically true, the lack of clear definition of the term, as well as the lack of clear definition of enforcement methods, are the very reason it is up to the courts in the first place. If it clearly defined what constitutes insurrection, there would be less of an issue with trying to enforce it. Even more important, if there was a clearly defined enforcement method (ie Congress declares it, or, knowing the founders, a state legislature), then the courts would not have the room to intervene as they did in reality.  Now, that's not to say there would not be any attempts to try and legalize a third term Trump run, but the constitution's line on presidential terms does not have any of the same weaknesses as its part on insurrection, and I can't see any court (not even the supreme court) overruling a state's decision not to put someone so blatantly ineligible on the ballot.

"I'm not following your logic. If him being an insurrectionist was not the contested issue, why do you say it's the problem? It's the Supreme Court that's the problem, not the law.  First, it should never be a political body determining someone's guilt. That should be determined by the courts as it was here. And when that guilt is determined, then that disqualification is self-enacting. You're an insurrectionist = you're ineligible. Full stop.   The Constitution does say that disqualification can be removed by an act of Congress. It says nothing about Congress, nor any state legislature, enacting the disqualification. It's actually a pretty ridiculous proposition that they would when you think about it. Is the legislature really expected to hold trials for every single person who may have participated who decides to run for an office to determine if they should be disqualified? Of course not.  Determining guilt is the role of the courts.   The problem here isn't with the law. The problem is the right wing of the Supreme Court has gone completely off the rails. This is the same type of nonsense they pulled when they stole the election by stopping the counting in the 2000 presidential election on the grounds of equal protection. That was so ridiculous they said it would not be precedence and only apply to that one case. If they hadn't it would invalidate pretty much every statewide and federal election ever. That was a bullshit decision just like this one was.   But yes, to invalidate the two term restriction would require and even more blatant disregard for the law. That is true. But the problem isn't the law. It's how far are these right-wing judicial activists willing to go.",loondawg,2025-04-25T10:39:30,1
"Another scenario I wouldn't put past Republicans if my collapse theory is wrong is that they would run him as I initially laid out, let him win the election, then decide to follow the Constitution after all by disqualifying him during the electoral vote count.  That would push the selection of president to Congress, which votes by state delegation. Republicans would likely have a clear advantage there and it would enable them to replace Trump with whomever they want.  The advantage of this is that they could run on Trump's popularity with his base instead of running someone riskier from the backbenches.   I'm no expert political analyst or anything, but I'm thinking that if there isn't some sort of internal civil war in Trumpland, I'd imagine this scenario to be the reason why because it would allow Republicans to have their cake and eat it too.",HagbardCelineHMSH,2025-04-24T20:23:50,11

We were talking politics, and he told me I don't understand what he really wants. He gestured towards all the beach-side property and said he didn't think that should belong to anyone, it should belong to everyone.  I love my dad so I didn't say to him what most people's reaction might have been.
