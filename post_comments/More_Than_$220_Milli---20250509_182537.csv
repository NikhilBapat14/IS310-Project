"As per [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-doge-government-contracts-b2748289.html) 📰:  - More than $220 million worth of contracts cancelled by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been brought back.  Forty-four of the government contracts ended by DOGE and Musk have been revived by federal agencies, according to a federal spending data review by The New York Times.  However, DOGE still lists 43 of those contracts on its website as having been terminated, and some were added after they had been restored. This led to several data errors on the site.  The White House told the outlet that the paperwork lag would be fixed. The contracts that have been rekindled include everything from software license agreements to partnerships with vendors in charge of data and records for the government. Most of the contracts came to an end in February and March amid demands that agencies make massive cutbacks.  Agencies subsequently restored the contracts, at times only days after they had been cancelled. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency restored a contract after two and a half hours, but DOGE still listed the contract as canceled for weeks. The contract was subsequently extended, now costing more than previously.  Musk and DOGE set out to cut $1 trillion out of the $7 trillion federal budget, but the backtracking on cancelled contracts revealed the difficulties of making such expansive cuts. Contractors told the paper that as DOGE rushed to urge agencies to cancel contracts that were likely to be revived, as some were required by law, and some required skills that the government doesn’t have.  “The DOGE Wall of Receipts provides the latest and most accurate information following a thorough assessment, which takes time,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told The New York Times. “Updates to the DOGE savings page will continue to be made promptly, and departments and agencies will keep highlighting the massive savings DOGE is achieving.”  DOGE has listed over 9,400 contracts it claims to have cancelled, totalling $32 billion in savings. The group claims to have saved $165 billion in taxpayer funds in total.  The White House spokesperson told The New York Times that the reversals it had found were “small potatoes” in comparison.  Musk has said from the beginning that the government would most likely have to backtrack on some of its spending cuts. Appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast in February, Musk said, “We need to act fast to stop wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money. But if we make a mistake, we’ll reverse it quickly.”  However, Musk also said that DOGE would share the details of its work publicly, saying that they “can name the specifics, line by line.” But The New York Times found several errors on the so-called “Wall of Receipts,” often inflating the supposed savings. DOGE has taken credit for ending programs that finished years or at times decades ago. It has also counted the same cancellations more than once and, at one point, shared a claim that jumbled “billion” and “million.”  This month, DOGE removed a contract that had been cancelled for less than a day, but also added five revived contracts to its “terminations” list, claiming $57 million in savings, which had already been restored, according to the paper.  Contractor Larry Aldrich was told in February that his contract doing web design and making videos for the Department of Veterans Affairs site for veterans with PTSD had been cancelled. The agreement was reinstated two weeks later.  “The V.A. cannot do this work on its own,” Aldrich told the paper. “They don’t have the manpower or the skill set.”  The reversal started in the middle of February, less than a month into President Donald Trump’s second stint in the White House. On February 14, Raquel Romero and her husband lost their contract offering leadership training to Agriculture Department attorneys. They regained $45,000 in revenue when all their other federal business had dried up.  “We had lost all of the income that we were planning for calendar year 2025. We’ve had to sell our house. We’re in the process of moving into a condo,” she told The New York Times.  The department told the paper that it revived the contracts after finding that it was required by law. Romero added that she believed the reversal was due to a personal intervention by one attorney in the department, who Romero said retired two weeks later.  Regarding contract reversals, the Department of Veterans Affairs comes on top with 16 cancelled and revived contracts. According to veterans’ groups speaking to the paper, some of the contracts were required by law, noting that one contract was for a contractor who helped veterans search for military records as evidence when applying for benefits, which was restored after just eight days.  Even with the revived contracts, experts say DOGE’s cuts have damaged the quality of government services.  “There doesn’t seem to be an approach to dig in on places where government services could really be improved,” the executive director of the Yale Budget Lab, Martha Gimbel, recently told The Guardian. “Any improvement in government services takes time. You have to invest. You have to build it out. You have to figure out how to fix it.”  “There has clearly been a degeneration of government services,” she added.  DOGE claimed to have saved $38 million over several years at the Department of Education after ending a contract to manage a data repository about schools across the country. However, lawmakers and advocates pushed back, arguing that the law required the information to be gathered for the government to know which schools were eligible for some grants. The contract was resurrected after 18 days; however, $17 million in funding had been removed.  The E.P.A. signed a contract with a company in Maryland in 2023 to help raise awareness about asthma. Contracting data revealed it was cancelled just after 4.30 p.m. on March 7 of this year. That same night, shortly before 7 p.m., it was reinstated. The E.P.A. told the paper that the reinstatement of a contract shows that the agency found that “funding action supported Administration priorities.”  The agency extended the contract for another year last month, agreeing to pay $171,000 more than before the contract was cancelled.",T_Shurt,2025-05-09T18:27:33,36
"While Musk was distracting his followers on Twitter with vague and misleading claims about his painstaking effort to eliminate ""waste"" and ""fraud"" from the government, he was also simultaneously abusing his unelected powers trying to protect his company's interests while secretly manipulating information about major ""spending cuts"" from his ""wall of receipts.""  Aside from his obvious conflicts of interest, I want to take the time to illustrate how it's actually Elon Musk and DOGE who are perpetuating fraud, abusing power and mismanaging government operations.  Most of Musk's public boasts on Twitter have been inaccurate or flat out unfounded. This has forced him to silently backtrack while still maintaining many of the lies about DOGE's efforts.  Musk has taken credit for ""cutting costs"" where credit wasn't due. For instance, he bragged about cancelling contracts that weren't going to be renewed in the first place.  > David Reid, an environmental scientist in Michigan, was surprised to learn his contract studying invasive species... was included on the list. “That contract wasn’t canceled by DOGE or anyone else,” he said. The contract expired on Dec. 31 and he decided to retire and not renew it, he said. “If they took credit for canceling the contract, they’re lying.”  Musk made frequent, erratic and false claims about ""massive amounts"" of fraud, but when those claims were proven to be misleading or inaccurate, he provided little to no transparency about these mistakes and his grovelling supporters on Twitter remained ignorant of the dishonesty of the whole DOGE operation.   DOGE deliberately obfuscated data and quietly deleted many of its claims from its own website. And even then,  its so called ""wall of receipts"" was still riddled with accounting errors, outdated data or other miscalculations.  Even as the number of errors continued to grow, the DOGE website was still increasing the total amount of savings it claims to have gleaned from its cost cutting efforts.  If you've spent any time on Twitter, you would have come to the conclusion that Elon was not only driving the narrative, but his audience was taking every single word of his as a matter of fact. And whether consciously or not, they put up blinders and disregarded any information that might have contradicted Musk's claims.  One of those claims came early on in Trump's second term, when Musk stated that he had helped eliminate $55 billion (now over 100 billion) in ""government waste,"" but the math says differently. Real estimates show that the number is substantially lower. While keep in mind, many of these agencies, employees and programs that DOGE is targeting aren't even warranting scrutiny in the first place.  As far as more examples go:  Some of the contracts that DOGE claims credit for canceling were sometimes double—or even triple counted.  In at least one case, DOGE claimed that an entire contract had been canceled, when only a portion of the work was stopped. And in other cases, these contracts that DOGE claims credit for cancelling actually ended under the Biden administration.  In another more commonly reported instance, DOGE announced that it had saved $8 billion by cancelling a contract with a company providing technical support for ICE. As it turns out, the contract's actual value was $8 *million.*  And whether deliberately or not, DOGE was also making some serious miscalculations.   To provide an example of how they were operating this way, I'll show you a specific case where DOGE cancelled a contract for alleged ""DEI services"" for the Department of Homeland security.   They claim that by canceling this contract, they saved exactly $5.4 million.  The total cost of this contract was $7.5 million. DOGE arrived at this $5.4 million figure by subtracting an amount that had already been presumably spent.  But it's not nearly as straightforward as this. Analysts say that values like this $5.4 million spending figure are way over-estimated.  This is because spending figures are often undercounted due to the data being out of date. Something DOGE hasn't accounted for in its cancelling of similar contracts.  What's more, the numbers don't account for other costs. Like the termination costs the government will have to pay to close these contracts, making these savings estimates what one expert called a ""meaningless metric.""  Contractors will have to lay off staff, close their offices, terminate leases and get rid of equipment. This is a time consuming process that can sometimes face legal challenges.  In other words, DOGE never took these things into consideration and its math has been way off from the beginning.  But wait, there's more...  DOGE also made unrealistic estimates based on savings from terminating what are called ""umbrella contracts.""  These are larger contracts where the government sets a ""ceiling"" that represents what it's willing to spend through orders with multiple vendors. These contracts can have ceilings as high as several billion dollars.  And in a lot of cases, the total cost of orders from vendors does not reach these ceilings. But DOGE did not account for this, and instead included the entire cost of the umbrella contract in their math. In other words, it's not real money, not real savings.  Another case involved DOGE *triple* counting savings for contracts with the USAID worth hundreds of millions, and after trying to make up for this mistake, they still ended up overestimating total savings by at least $270 million.  A similar case involved a contract with the EPA for ""DEI services"" that was over counted three times as well.  In another instance, DOGE incorrectly claimed $232 million in savings through a contract with the SSA, when the actual amount was closer to $560,000.  You want to talk about fraud and mismanagement? Look no further, the call is coming from inside the house.  What's more, Elon's ""wall of receipts"" includes hundreds of cases that haven't saved taxpayers *a damn thing*. For example, in one case that was listed, a contract worth $10 million with the SEC actually amounted to $0 in savings because that contract expired a year ago. It was all a scam.  Many of these cancelled contracts relate, in some form or another, to the elimination of perceived ""DEI"" programs. Most of the cancellations listed include businesses that are disproportionately run by women and minorities.  Meaning that this effort was far more ideological than strategic. Elon and his Muskrats were simply going after whatever agencies they perceived as operating under some radical left agenda.   And all the while, Musk and his supporters were failing to address, or even acknowledge the fact that his companies are subsidized to the teeth and he was taking active steps to protect his own interests.  In reality, DOGE was not acting on behalf of the American people, but was pursuing an agenda that was fueled by the right's culture wars and the narcissistic, shallow ambitions of an unelected plutocrat and his team of lackeys who all thought they were the main character in Mr. Robot.   This effort was driven by the irrational fears and ideological convictions of a small number of incompetent reactionaries. There was nothing sincere, ""merit-based"" or strategic about it. One might say it's all been quite *wasteful.*",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-09T18:48:19,37
