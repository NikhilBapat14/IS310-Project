Characterizing Buttigieg as 'wandering' into hostile territory reads to me as a direct attempt to downplay his political acumen. He wanders nowhere.,darsynia,2025-04-25T14:07:32,15

">Pete Buttigieg made national headlines after his noteworthy appearance on [Andrew Schultz’s “Flagrant” podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx7GvYSq64) this week. Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, received praise online for his conversation on the podcast that many describe as being a part of the “manosphere” that helped President Donald Trump win the election.  >Buttigieg has often wandered into hostile territory for Democrats and made frequent appearances on Fox News in the lead-up to the election. Buttigieg has been applauded for his comments on Fox News, which he said during the podcast has not invited him back recently.  >“Like it’s all well and good for me to keep going on Fox News, and I will. Although they don’t seem to be inviting me as much lately,” Buttigieg said on the “Flagrant” podcast.  >Schultz then suggested that Fox News was a coward for not having Buttigieg on with a vulgar insult.  >“Mayor Pete is not exactly the one you send out to get the young broke. I mean, you may as well send Dylan Mulvaney doing a makeup class,” [Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo said](https://xcancel.com/Acyn/status/1915563896888500562), referring to a social media influencer at the center of a Bud Light controversy last year.  >“He's pretending not to be a beta,” [Rachel Campos-Duffy, co-host of “FOX & Friends Weekend,” claimed.](https://xcancel.com/Acyn/status/1915565101098426864)",lightlantern,2025-04-25T13:21:12,4

"“Pete is pretending not to be a beta”, per Fox News.   Pete is the opposite of beta: Harvard graduate, Oxford University, Rhodes Scholar, Naval intelligence officer, and deployed to Afghanistan.

"He’s one of the most effective communicators the dems have. The right always downplays  him because he is arguably one of the more substantial threats to their to their power in that arena.   He’s a gay vet who understands how to speak to and interact with conservatives, and generally how to just act like a normal, decent human being while still being clear and upfront with him about where his values and perspectives differ.   People can’t help but like him when they give him a chance, and his leadership qualities are apparent to pretty much anyone who gives him a serious listen. I.e. one that doesn’t come in the form of a short sound bite or a nonsense ‘ambush’ style interview (like some of those he’s done on Fox) where they simply talk over everything he tries to say. But there is a reason why they do that... they are afraid that if they let him talk, he will actually get through to some people. They want to bring him on to try to shut him down and discredit him, but at this point, I bet you most Fox hosts are straight up terrified to step on stage with this guy. Every time they’ve tried to do that to him in recent years, he crushes it and leaves the host reeling back towards talking points to avoid engaging with him. It’s honestly hilarious to watch, especially the Fox News ones where the hosts get really worked up. Still frustrating to see, but it’s funny how poorly equipped most people on the right are to have a serious conversation with a guy like him.   Of course these media figured on the right do everything they can to try to lump him in with other democrats and portray him as someone who is out of touch with conservatives.   If they let the word get out that he is a dem who will actually listen to conservatives, and who can actually speak to the things they care about without offending their ‘delicate sensibilities’, Pete very well might steal their own audiences out from under them.   Can he convert them away from conservatism? No. But that’s the beauty of it. Pete is never trying to do that when he does this kind of outreach. He actually listens, even when what is being said is batshit crazy or straight up stupid. That’s why it works. He utterly breaks the Fox News narrative that all dems are radical elitists who don’t care about the things that matter to conservatives, pretty much every time he does these sorts of interview. And conservatives who take the time to really listen will actually eat it up because they don’t feel like they are being pressured by him to adopt more liberal views or break with conservative positions on things.   He talks to them like real people and gives them actual reasons to consider changing their minds without trying to change who they are. That’s why I love it when he does these interviews. If only we had a hundred more just like him in the Democratic Party. We’d be a lot better off. I don’t agree with everything he does, but for that talent of his alone, he’s worth more than the majority of the seniors in the party, combined. We need people like him to cut through the noise and fog spewed out by the right wing propaganda networks.",nikolai_470000,2025-04-26T07:05:28,3
