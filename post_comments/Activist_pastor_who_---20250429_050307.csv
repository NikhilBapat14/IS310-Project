"Agreed. To be clear, I approve of what this person was doing. It seems like an effective form of protest. But as any seasoned protester knows, you can't intentionally break the rules while protesting and then act surprised when they come for you. That's part of why punishable protesting is such a strong gesture--those people know they might face jail and care strongly enough to do it anyways.  Though it's always reasonable to complain about uneven treatment. I'm still confused why the mob of traitors in 2020 was allowed to even breach the doors. Around that time, the police were going full war-mode against peaceful BLM supporters not breaking any rules and singing church songs in support...but a literal angry mob chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" was allowed to enact the greatest assault on the US capitol since the war of 1812?

It sure sounds to me like the cops are saying he was arrested for praying.  Can you clarify why that is inaccurate?  >When I was a police officer I routinely heard ""they arrested me for just walking to the store,"" when they were actually arrested for assault and battery while walking to the store.  And also ""they arrested me for driving to my mom's house,"" but while driving a stolen car involved in a hit-and-run.  None of this has anything to do with this case.   Also, the people they arrested didn't claim they were arrested for praying -- the capital police themselves are saying that.  Do you think it is reasonable to arrest people for praying? If so, why?  And if not, then why do you seem to be unhappy that people are talking about people being arrested for praying?",helmutye,2025-04-30T01:47:14,2

Also: [https://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm](https://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)  ""Agap√© is a term used in the New Testament to describe **a selfless, sacrificial, unconditional love.** It is the highest form of love, often associated with the love of God for humanity and the love that believers are called to have for one another. Unlike other Greek words for love, such as ""eros"" (romantic love) or ""philia"" (brotherly love), **agap√© is not based on emotions or feelings but is an act of the will, characterized by a commitment to the well-being of others.**""  Do you think Jesus and His followers went around attacking people who were against them (enemies) with swords?  The only time one did, if I'm correct, was when Peter cut off a man's ear, but Jesus rebuked Peter and healed the man.  An often quoted passage to justify violence is [Luke 22:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A36&version=ESV), but immediately after, in [Luke 22:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A37&version=ESV), it's shown why Jesus told them to go buy swords.  It seems as if people don't read, they do but don't understand, or they just pick what appeals to them.  >And while you‚Äôre entirely correct that anything can be ‚Äútwisted‚Äù.

"I am not projecting anything. Christian isn't an identity. It may be part of someones identity, but it isn't an identity.   The only thing required to be a Christian is professing Jesus as your personal savior. If all this other stuff actually applies to deciding if someone is a Christian then who makes the distinction? Cause the Bible isn't clear. It contradicts itself. So who makes the determination? And by that I mean here in the real world where it actually matters. Not the afterlife when it does not one living any good. The answer is no one. The person themselves makes the distinction by professing Jesus as their personal savior.   If identity is being invoked it is worth pointing out that you are saying that a part of a persons professed identity can be denied by other Christians just based on their own interpretation of a millennia old book written, translated, and re translated over the course of a thousand years.",FeedMeACat,2025-04-29T12:37:07,1

Especially since Deborah, Ruth, Esther, and other, virtuous women played important roles, if I'm correct.  Paul using Eve to condemn all women isn't right.  >Slavery is just A-ok in gods eyes: Leviticus 25:44-46 Most of Exodus 21 Ephesians 6:5‚Äì8 (Again so many more)  I wouldn't say it's A-OK with God, since He wants people to choose to not oppress others and to free others from oppression, while He also intervenes sometimes (When or why, who knows?

"Dog - as a non-practicing jew, let me clarify that my understanding and appreciation of most faiths is historical in their context.   Calling yourself something and practicing that something is two radically different things. Hence, in earlier posts I posit that appreciating how and why someone identifies as something is important.   Plenty of people identify as Christians, but have never read the bible or understand the core elements of the faith - e.g. abiding by the specific directions of Jesus, which really comes across as hippy-dippy-drug-commune shit if we're being honest.   We fail to appreciate that there are LITERAL SWATHES OF THE UNITED STATES where you are born into being a Christian Republican because that's what is there and nothing else, with literally no ability to easily extract yourself from the homogenized mass. They don't know why they are, they don't care why they are, they just know they are - and generally don't care much about it as they are fighting to survive like everyone else, lacking the time, drive, or education to see value in being different.  And when things go wrong, that conservatively controlled squawkbox that monopolized their region tells them their suffering is caused by people outside of their homogenized mass, we then get what we see now.  I also posit that we should ignore the religious theming - because this is about individuals, disorders of thought, and moral positioning rather than a wide ranging indictment of an element of faith. I agree - most of these people are not ""real"" Christians, but that doesn't change that their structures of belief are being used and manipulated by others.  At base, even if Christianity vanished tomorrow - the problem would remain. It's not a religion problem, it's a societal and individual one.",8anbys,2025-04-29T12:52:56,1

"I don't know what you want. Maybe your Jewish history colors your perception where someone can't just become a member of the faith. They have to be approved. That isn't the case in Christianity.   If you profess Jesus as your personal savior you can call yourself a Christian. Other Christians will call you Christian. Will accept you into the community of the church. They don't run some test of living the values or knowing the text. That acceptance means they are Christian. There is no practicing of anything other than social performance each Sunday. That just isn't part of it. I know, I was raised in it.   If you are looking at these other qualifications then you don't understand this version of Christianity. I recommend you attend a few services.   Making this distinction lets people off the hook when it comes to the group critiquing itself.

When I say God isn't A-OK about something, I'm not suggesting God couldn't prevent such things, but I'm pointing out that elsewhere, there are passages stating God is against them.  ""A-OK"" means ""[completely right or acceptable](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/a-ok)"".  Now, regarding God's potential to prevent awful events from occurring, and His not doing so, this doesn't show that He endorses it, any more than the Law saying divorce was allowed meant God endorsed divorce.  Saying that, I think God should act against harmful acts like slavery and inequality.  >I don‚Äôt have time or the energy to explain to a (god I hope) teenager how the Bible is an abhorrent book. You even admitted it yourself, you just don‚Äôt realize it or refuse to accept it.  Am I admitting it or refusing to accept it?  Also, no, I'm 30.  To an extent, we're probably on the same side, and the distinctions I'm making are to show that people calling themselves Christian don't meet the criteria.  I'm not defending Christianity but trying to make sure people can't take advantage of it.  It's very possible that the more Christianity becomes distorted, more people will follow that version.",EsperGri,2025-04-29T15:29:59,1
