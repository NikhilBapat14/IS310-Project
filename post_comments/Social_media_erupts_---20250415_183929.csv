I really hope that she runs in 2028.   My mostly normal but still liberal friends are very afraid of her running because they know she's bonkers and they know she'll go down in hard flames.,TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-15T19:11:58,24
"Part of me wants to see her run so she can get DESTROYED, the other part is scared that something could potentially to terribly wrong and she would end up winning, which would be disastrous for our country. She is about as woke and radical as they get.     I'd much rather see Tim Walz run, vance has already destroyed him one, can do it again!",backpackingquestion,2025-04-15T23:14:07,4
The worst thing to do is underestimate her.  They need to take it seriously even if she is a nutcase.,ponmbr,2025-04-15T20:27:04,6
Agreed. If she became president... that would be very scary.,TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-15T21:03:36,4
