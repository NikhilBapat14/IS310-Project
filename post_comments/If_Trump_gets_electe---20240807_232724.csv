"So just to start, we don't know. This would depend a lot on your mother's specific situation. If she maintains her legal status, that might significantly affect her ability to stay.  But with respect to Trump, we don't know. He frankly has no real plans written down, and I'm not aware of any specifics. Here is the only policy statement he has on his website related to this.  >Carry out the largest deportation operation in american history  From the 2024 RNC platform:  >President Trump and Republicans will reverse the Democrats’ destructive Open Borders Policies that have allowed criminal gangs and Illegal Aliens from around the World to roam the United States without consequences. The Republican Party is committed to sending Illegal Aliens back home and removing those who have violated our Laws.  So we have no real specifics. But if you are in the country illegally, I wouldn't expect any leniency or forgiveness from a Trump Administration.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-08T12:39:49,3
"I work in immigration policy now and through the entire first Trump presidency. We won’t know exactly what he’s going to do until or unless he is elected, but generally speaking Trump made life harder for all immigrants, legal or undoc, to varying extents based on individual circumstance. Is a Canadian in a legal visa status going to be the target of anti-migrant policy? Probably not. However, we can logically assume based on round 1 that he’d be installing far-right xenophobes in leadership positions and defunding administrative agencies that actually adjudicate benefits to increase $$ for enforcement/detainment, which means a lot of immigrants who are doing things “the right way” are inevitably going to suffer. Trump will be bad for all immigrants and their loved ones, full stop.  Your mom should talk to an immigration attorney not necessarily because of perceived future risk so much as understanding her status, rights, and pathways to permanent residency right now. She should have been eligible for a marriage-based green card based a long time ago, but only an experienced immigration attorney to provide a comprehensive assessment based on her immigration history. She’s going to be fine, just get her on the right track and get her adjustment application filed if she hasn’t already. Good luck!",demeter2,2024-08-12T17:26:53,1
