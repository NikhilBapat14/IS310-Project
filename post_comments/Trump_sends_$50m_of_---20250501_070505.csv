50 million?? Lol.  that's so small an amount and  not even remotely helpful it's basically insulting,coatofforearm,2025-05-01T07:12:08,30
The Navy fighter jet that fell into the Red Sea this week cost 60+million dollars.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-01T07:36:11,11
"Trump is still extorting Zelenskyy. Trump is a dumber, uglier , and more immoral version of Tony Soprano. I blame every republican.",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-01T07:16:24,9
This is really the best case scenario we can hope for under trump.   He's not going to help anyone without some sort of material value coming the other way. It's the only way to have them invested in any sort of way in the well-being of Ukraine   If this does lead to a ceasefire Russia will break it eventually as they always do. It's not over. They will regroup and rebuild and invade again some point down the line  Zelensky isn't stupid. I'll trust his judgement that he knows what is best for his county here and how to deal with different administrations.   Europe cannot support Ukraine in any serious way on their own. They don't have the money or equipment to do so for the long haul,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-01T07:12:05,5

"He told Ukraine they could keep it if they go fish it out, and he cut the price by $10mil because of the water damage.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-05-01T10:30:42,1
"He is, but also a lot of Ukraine’s concentrated mineral wealth is in areas currently occupied by Russia so we’d have a difficult time extracting, which I think is a plus.",Lontology,2025-05-01T09:03:37,0
">If this does lead to a ceasefire Russia will break it eventually as they always do. It's not over. They will regroup and rebuild and invade again some point down the line  That's precisely what has got me worried. If Trump is trying to acquire rare minerals and this is the route he wants to take, then that basically means America is positioning itself in a really tight spot ~~if~~ when things escalate.",Connect-Review117,2025-05-01T08:00:21,5

""" wtf man, dis don't even work!! it dont even have an engine!!""",coatofforearm,2025-05-01T07:55:10,0
Yeah agreed. And it's not like they are just set up already to extract things.  I don't know what the timeline would be for investment to come in and things to get set up and ready either.  None of us can get in the mind of Putin but I imagine he would try to test the waters on a small scale as things start to ramp up in terms of infrastructure just to see how we react,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-01T08:13:09,1
He didn't say it was better- he said people are misunderstanding the action item of the article.,Connect-Review117,2025-05-01T08:06:18,5
The minimum being sent is 50m but likely much more. Reading comprehension is fundamental.,SwaySh0t,2025-05-01T11:27:49,3
I don’t think my comment mentioned it being better or worse. Could be mistaken.,bizcliz6969,2025-05-01T08:01:58,1
drones too or cash to buy components would probably be great for them.,Skraelings,2025-05-01T08:57:51,1
