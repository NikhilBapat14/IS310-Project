"I agree with Bill Mayer!  HBO ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher condemned some younger elements within the Democratic Party for failing to decry radical Islamic terrorism while supporting anti-Israel demonstrations. He declared that the party is ""doomed"" if it doesn’t get rid of this fixation.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-10T12:26:53,42
"The corrupt politicians leading the Democratic Party know that they've dug their own pit (from the inside out). If these radicals don't support the Democrats, then the Democrats will lose elections in all purple states (and a few solid blue states). So, the DNC is forced to try and cater to the whims of the whiny radical left. So, oddly enough, the Democratic Party has essentially been *hijacked* by the radical left.",chrismireya,2025-05-10T11:44:27,41

The liberal party has a built-in defect. They are unable to criticize anything related to minorities without it being racist. They are now the party of terrorism and antisemitism. Good luck winning another election with that.,TryCopingPlz,2025-05-10T12:13:06,31
Their treatment of Jews is nothing compared to their treatment against Whites. That's the problem we need to be talking about.,Right_Archivist,2025-05-10T11:19:18,41

It’s democratic leadership. They are the problem.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-10T13:55:27,6
Why didn't he stand up to all of the racism against white people from the Democratic Party for decades prior? He had to wait until leftists became antisemitic to take a principled stance against bigotry?,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-10T16:18:56,2
This random TV show guy gets way more posts here than he deserves.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-10T13:36:32,3
Nah they can do what they want they just imported more votes than many states have people living in it and it is looking like it's going to be impossible to deport even a fraction of them before the anchor baby up.,Hectoriu,2025-05-10T15:12:58,0
