"If conservatives needed to provide concrete proof to their base for all their horseshit, we'd be living in a much more pleasant reality.  Alas, that's not the case.",Pantarus,2025-05-04T11:53:15,143

The closest thing to actual litter boxes in schools - the emergency bucket-toilets to be used during lockdowns with the aid of a little cat litter - could potentially be eliminated if we as a nation took a rational approach to gun control legislation and mental health care availability.  Instead we have this idiocy.,PunfullyObvious,2025-05-04T12:35:16,38
"Even if it were happening, why would a bill be the ""solution""? I would expect this sort of thing to be handled at the school/school district level as a dress code violation.",snoo_spoo,2025-05-04T12:18:37,18

Possibly motivated because Heritage Foundation was hacked by a gay furry hacktivist group last year? Conversation between heritage exec mike howell (in charge of finding DEI-affiliated feds to target for illegal firing) and sieged sec got spicy: [https://gizmodo.com/heritage-foundation-denies-that-it-was-penetrated-by-gay-furry-hackers-after-bizarre-chat-logs-leak-2000469356](https://gizmodo.com/heritage-foundation-denies-that-it-was-penetrated-by-gay-furry-hackers-after-bizarre-chat-logs-leak-2000469356),Huge_Excitement4465,2025-05-04T12:17:48,8

The last Republican candidate for governor in my state of Colorado had a really similar [issue as well](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/heidi-ganahl-colorado-furries-identify-b2196410.html) Let's face facts- a significant portion of their voting base is primed to believe this kind of crap.,ipanoah,2025-05-04T17:51:38,3
So the Texas legislature is coming for the [high school football mascots](https://texashsfootball.com/20-best-mascots-texas-total-results/)? Hmm... Perhaps opponents of this bill need to recruit some of them to show up at meetings to illustrate how furries are a widely appreciated community asset.,ohbonobo,2025-05-04T19:39:52,3

"It's no joke that furries run the internet. This legislation is stupid, but if they make a larger push at a higher level to make wearing fursuits a crime, I can absolutely see government officials losing internet access which would be hilarious.",Hammeredmantis,2025-05-04T13:47:26,6

I live in rural VA and they still talk about litter boxes being in schools although there has never been a confirmed case of that happening.,NegotiationExtra8240,2025-05-04T16:52:38,12
It does matter to them. This is how they scare the hell out of parents to vote against their best interests and get those private school vouchers flowing. Now we have to exert effort to stop it.,Dapper_Peanut_1879,2025-05-04T12:14:31,14

"There is, in Colorado.   After Columbine a high school kept kitty litter in classrooms in case active shooter drills went too long and someone had to urinate while in lock down.  https://www.denverpost.com/2018/03/03/school-shooting-preparations/  This was back in 2018. If my hunch is correct, conservatives latched onto a legitimately sad/concerning reason why kitty litter and schools were mentioned in the same paragraph and flipped it on it's head to their advantage.  Their base will believe any horseshit without fact-checking them, so here we are.",Pantarus,2025-05-04T18:14:46,18
