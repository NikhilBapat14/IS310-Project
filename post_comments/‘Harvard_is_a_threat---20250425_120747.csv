"What Trump is doing to the universities, their professors that disagree with his policies and students that exercise their free speech comes from Hitler's playbook after he was elected Chancellor.  The irony is rather than openly embracing antisemitism as Hitler and the Third Reich did, the Trump administration is using it as the reason for their undemocratic actions.  Free countries in the future, and let's hope that the USA survives Trump to remain free, will discuss this perilous time in the future.",anitarielleliphe,2025-04-25T12:15:13,45
"Says the one who is the real threat to Democracy!! 🤦  Snippet:  >The Trump Organization has fired one of its legal advisers because he also represents Harvard University, with whom President Donald Trump is in a pitched battle over federal funding.  >The move came after Trump slammed the attorney, William Burck, in a post to his [Truth Social network](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114393194962253226) on Thursday, [The Hill reported](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5266636-trump-org-fires-lawyer-william-burck-harvard-ties/).  >In that post, Trump urged his sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, who oversee the family business, to fire Burck.  >""Harvard is an Anti-Semitic, Far Left Institution, as are numerous others, with students being accepted from all over the World that want to rip our Country apart,"" Trump said in the post.  >*“The place is a Liberal mess, allowing a certain group of crazed lunatics to enter and exit the classroom and spew fake ANGER AND HATE. It is truly horrific! Now, since our filings began, they act like they are all “American Apple Pie,” he continued. “Harvard is a threat to Democracy, with a lawyer, who represents me, who should therefore be forced to resign immediately, or be fired. He’s not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!”*",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-25T12:08:45,27

"Thank you for sharing that link! Ironic that it's on our government's website, right?  Just a small part...because it should remind us of someone else who used to have one of Hitler's books on his bedside table, according to his ex wife!     >After Adolf Hitler was appointed German Chancellor in January 1933, the new Nazi government began an effort to completely reorder public and private life in Germany.1 The Nazi regime quickly targeted German universities—among the most elite in the world at the time—for restructuring according to Nazi principles.2 While the Nazi Ministry of Education initiated reforms, local Nazi organizations and student activists worked to bring Nazi ideals to German campuses.   >These forces, along with increasing antisemitism under Nazi rule, transformed everyday life at German universities. Throughout this period, students, faculty, and staff made individual decisions that both upheld and opposed Nazi ideology.3   >With the passage of the ""Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service"" in 1933, **most Jewish professors in Germany were dismissed from their positions.** Others, such as Professor Eugen Mittwoch, were able to keep their posts temporarily only due to the political value of their research. After purging Jewish and ""politically undesirable"" faculty, the regime then targeted the student body with the ""Law Against Overcrowding in Schools and Universities.""",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-25T13:00:43,9
"Mean words will come back to all of us eventually.   When these vermin decide to weed out dissedents by having A.I. scan everyone's social media and tie it to us via the new federal government linked database that was mandated. It is to hold *every* piece of information that the federal government knows about you in one location.  I assume that I will eventually be incarcerated for my naughty words on political forums, even though I never make threats or advocate for violence.
