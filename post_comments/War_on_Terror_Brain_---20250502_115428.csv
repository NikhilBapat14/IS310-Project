"Yup, old, old playbook.  And there are genuinely dangerous people.  But Trumpism and fascism is not a solution, in fact, they are part of the problem.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-02T11:55:31,25
"So many of the world’s problems would be solved, or at least significantly lessened, if we just stopped fucking around in the Middle East. No more bombing, no more couping, no more genocide, no more never-ending wars, and all we would have to do is nothing. It is so much more difficult to power the war machine than it is to shut it off.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-05-02T12:02:41,8
"I know I'm not the only one who's been saying for years that all this domestic surveillance, police militarization, expansion of ""anti-terror"" laws to include protesters, etc. would inevitably lead us here. The country has had a latent population of authoritarians and fascists for decades, and leaving those kinds of tools around would make it that much easier to make a move.   Now here we are.",Crommach,2025-05-02T14:59:50,6
"""Illegal"" immigrants commit __less__ crime than Americans.    ""Illegal"" immigrants start more new businesses than Americans, and contribute more to our GDP in the long term.  ""Illegal"" immigrants are less prone to ignoring science and medical facts than Americans.  Seems to me, we need more immigrants to dilute the crappy native-born ignoramuses.  Illegal or not.",insuproble,2025-05-02T12:02:39,11
“Colored and homosexual ‘vermin’.” to put a point on it.  Goes back further than the war on terror. I’ll just pick one out of the American history hat:   [Operation Racial Slur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback)  Bigots will make up anything to have us vs them. It’s how the American bigot remains so powerful.,LuvKrahft,2025-05-02T12:02:34,10
"The thing that’s really scary to me is that once you get past the morons in the middle who got duped by targeted propaganda like “Kamala is gonna take down the Internet”, we’re being governed by like 15% of people who are fucking nuts, with an additional 5-10% who simply don’t want to be wrong or for their side to lose.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T12:04:16,3
"I love that the title of this article uses the phrase ""brain rot."" The youngbloods of this generation made the perfect phrase to describe what happened to their parents' brains in the wake of 9/11.   It started small with Colin Powell holding up a vial of white powder to justify a trillion dollar catastrophe, continued to grow through the 2008 crisis and the repression of the Occupy Wall Street protests and the bailing out of the banks who robbed us first, and really took off when MAGA were called ""deplorables"" and absorbed the moniker, first ironically, then entirely in earnest.   Now they claim their guy was anti-war the whole time and they salivate at the same people who got us into this mess now removing the checks and balances that would stop us from doing it again (and again, and again, even domestically).  Total brain rot.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T12:09:26,2

"That wouldn’t solve anything. The mix of arms with which they kill each other would merely be richer in Chinese and Russian originated weapons, or with axes and swords if those proved unavailable.",CaliMassNC,2025-05-02T14:22:44,0
"Even if every nation stayed out of the Middle East, the wars would not end. The people in that region have been killing each other for one reason or another since before the Bronze Age. There has never been a serious long-term peace in the region. Even when one Empire or Caliph gained control, inter-tribal warfare and raiding were common to the point it was basically an institution.   You pull every army and arms deal out of the Middle East and in 5 years all that would change is that they're using spears and knives to kill each other.",DisMFer,2025-05-02T16:08:57,0
