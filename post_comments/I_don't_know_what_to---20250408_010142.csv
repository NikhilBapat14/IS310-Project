"There's us a guy over on IG claiming China just signaled they might just copy all of our IP and patent laws be damned. Where they (China) used to alter their knock-offs a tad to avoid international legal action, since these tariffs they are retaliating with claiming they could actually hurt us by copying our IP.  Remember China only sends 16% of it's goods to us, but they sell to the world, we need them more than they need us.  [https://www.chinaiplawupdate.com/2025/03/chinas-national-intellectual-property-administration-releases-2025-budget-and-targets-expecting-over-5-million-patent-applications/](https://www.chinaiplawupdate.com/2025/03/chinas-national-intellectual-property-administration-releases-2025-budget-and-targets-expecting-over-5-million-patent-applications/)  Some guy was the only one in the comments claiming this would never work but who is gonna stop China from copying iPhones, microwaves, computers etc from top to bottom with no alterations? I don't know if its going to work but if I were an IP/tech concern I'd be pooping my pants right about now. Even the threat of violating patent, copyright and trademark law is scary let alone actually doing it.

">  Remember China only sends 16% of it's goods to us, but they sell to the world, we need them more than they need us.   That's around 16% of exports that go to the US. In 2023, that represented 2.9% of its GDP. A hit, but recoverable. China has been moving away from being so heavily export based to having a stronger domestic market for a while. This addresses complaints not just from the US, but also from other trading partners. That said, there are still concerns from trading partners, like with a tendency to build up excess capacity in state owned enterprises and then dump that excess capacity into other economies.",pingveno,2025-04-08T18:38:40,2

"You know what is a trip (thank you for your thoughtful reply) I tried to write my comment as a neutral inquiry.

Sure I posted these links because as I stated ""some guy over on IG was claiming xyz"" so I'm over here wondering my darn self why someone would reply off beat like that!

I don't know if what the guy over on IG was correct or not but ""IF"" China did flout our IP laws this is exactly what can happen.  When people come into conversations and try to obfuscate or introduce misinformation and disinformation for whatever purpose they only serve to further divide this nation and our communities.  and hamper remedies to cure already deteriorating situations.

"Depends on what you mean by stolen? Most IP is not Coca-Cola's secret recipe. IP is easily known. For example, with a handful of circles, I can draw Mickey Mouse, but I haven't stolen Mickey until I use it for my own profit.   US companies eagerly show Chinese companies their IP secrets. They have to make the products after all. But contracts have stopped these companies from cutting out Apple and just selling iPhones all over the world.   But if these Chinese companies suddenly can't ship the US products to the US to keep their contracts, what is to stop them from just selling these products around the world and cutting out the US companies? If China won't enforce the contract, there is no recourse for US companies.",SumpCrab,2025-04-08T18:54:41,2

Considered to be worth millions, it was sent to his accomplice in China. It would ultimately benefit the Chinese government, as well as China-based companies and universities.

So it seems they actually have U.S. IP, which goes to my point they can now just make this stuff and sell anywhere they please.
