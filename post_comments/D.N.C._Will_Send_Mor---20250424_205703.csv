"Never gonna happen. I watched a super moderate, veteran, well spoken man who truly cared about the people and visited every corner of the state lose in a landslide to a dude who visits Missouri once every few years. Kunce and Hawley are who I‚Äôm referring to. It is what it is at this point. We are so polarized that people don‚Äôt care about actual candidates or policies.",TDeath21,2025-04-24T21:00:35,31

"As much as I shit on the DNC for being reactionary centrist hacks, this is actually a good move.  Post New Deal Democrats (from 76-present) neglected state legislature so badly. It allowed the gerrymandering to get worse and worse and this is the first of many steps to turning that page.  Democrats used to dominate state legislature. There's currently about 4,100 Republicans in state legislative seats to about 3,200 Democrats. Chip away in the state houses for the long term projects.  The GOP motivates their base across consistent ideological points with local flavor sprinkled on top. Democrats need to recapture the message that local government affects people the most, focus on statehouses and start peeling back control from the GOP.",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-24T21:11:16,13

"It doesn't matter.

"It kind of sucks because there is no way red states will ever see past this. Everyone who votes in red states has a really comfortable life. So they feel like the Democrat‚Äôs social spending programs are a threat to their lives.¬†  I actually agree that there needs to be more outreach in red states. The Democrat voters there know they are outnumbered and they know they will lose the election. They‚Äôre tired of having to put up with Republican policies.¬†  But the thing is, Democrats are hemorrhaging in blue states. Trump made the widest gains in blue states. Republicans know that by pitting men against women, they can cause massive losses to Democrats in blue states because now you have 45% of the population debating whether Trump is a little better for them. And if you only get 25% to vote red, that 25% might convince their wives to vote red. California is 35% to 65% state where Dems are safe. But with this new agenda, you got 25% voting red reliably and that 25% brings in 15% with them, bringing the total to 40%. Then they can make further gains by pitching economic growth to the undecided female voters. Although that might be like 2 or 3%, this number can grow if you pass very restrictive abortion laws, but you let the blue states decide how to follow them. Then all of a sudden you get 1% more believing that maybe it‚Äôs not the end of the world if they have less rights, as long as they get to keep a comfortable lifestyle. And then you defund education, where women outnumber men, 55% up to 60% in some states. That means in 10 years, women will be more focused on nonpolitical agenda. And this is actually where the Republican Party excels because they go into small towns and sensationalize the violent crimes in the area and the people there have developed a belief that the violence is spilling over from a nearby Democrat-run city who can‚Äôt keep control. And violence is an issue that women care deeply about as it is harder for them to fight back (think Ana Kasparian). But the men are told that Liberal women are too naive about the real world. And they are also told that since they fight the wars, their vote should be stronger.¬†",JollyToby0220,2025-04-25T02:06:41,0
I think that‚Äôs a good idea. A problem that people have with democrats is that they view them as coastal elites. Having them run for offices in local races is a good way to combat that.,D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-04-25T00:05:48,3

"Agreed. The Democrats are facing a monumental task to undo 50 years of listlessness.  I read a good book last week called Chaotic Neutral by Ed Burmilla, an unabashed progressive, but talented political historian tracing the shift of the party from being a stalwart for the working class to being the baroque lifestyle branding it's become.  A large portion is focused on how Democrats dominated statehouses into the 90s and how the gerrymandering of 2000 and 2010 from state legislature slimmed down Democratic national chances to gain consistent majorities.  He also goes into the way that the Republican party is able to consistently message their party platform at the localest of local levels (think about insane school board members) all the way to the white house. And how Democrats haven't responded to this shift for 20 years and it detached people from the national party. I don't agree with all his points necessarily but overall I highly recommend it.",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-24T21:22:36,1
"You‚Äôre acting like primaries are fully democratic. Closed primaries don‚Äôt allow all citizens to vote, only the ones registered in the party.

"And that was at a time when there were tons of actual swing voters and split ticket voters. Bush also tried to privatize Social Security in 2005 and got huge backlash for it and the unpopularity of the Iraq Invasion had come to light. It was a perfect storm of everything, none of which the Democrats actually did. The cherry on top of course was the most well spoken, articulate, and charismatic candidate fell right into the Democrats lap when Obama decided to run for President earlier than expected and shot up the primary polls seemingly out of nowhere to snag the nomination.",TDeath21,2025-04-24T21:48:38,8
