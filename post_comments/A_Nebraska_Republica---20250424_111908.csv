"Look, John McCain was a war hero served his country with honor and distinction. For that, he will always be a hero. Having said all that, he's partially responsible for the mess we're in now. His nomination of Sarah Palin for vice president normalized stupid people getting into politics is the reason why we have the moron in chief. We don't need a new John McCain.",mev186,2025-04-24T11:30:10,9

Nebraskan here that has never voted for Bacon.  His district has been increasingly becoming blue - Omaha voted for Harris and gave her one electoral vote.  He's likely playing the middle ground to appeal to his constituents more than he's trying to be altruistic.,TheBahamaLlama,2025-04-24T11:55:43,2

"From Bloomberg Opinion's Patricia Lopez:   Republican Representative Don Bacon is a maverick in the mold of the late Senator John McCain — loyal to country and party but unafraid to speak his mind should either go down the wrong path.   He takes his work seriously but not himself. His nickname, which started out as his Air Force call sign, is “Bits” (as in “Bacon Bits”), and he plays off that pun regularly on social media.",bloombergopinion,2025-04-24T11:20:25,1
"That's cool. If McCain had won in 2008, do we think he'd have magically acted any differently than Bush? Would he have vetoed major Republican legislation? How would a Vice President Sarah Palin have accelerated the downward trend of the party?",alabasterskim,2025-04-24T13:03:01,0
"McCain voted against abortion rights over 98% of the time, was against federally funded sex education and birth control, and was against same-sex marriage *and even civil unions.* He also pushed the ""vaccines cause autism"" nonsense, and school vouchers.  But he voted against republican bills a couple high-profile times, and probably wasn't literally a nazi, so he was basically AOC except a little older. /s",erocuda,2025-04-24T12:06:12,4
"John McCain did not ""normalize stupid people getting into politics"".  Say what you will about Sarah Palin, but that was Trump's doing, with the assistance of Putin.  John McCain was staunchly against Putin.   Sarah Palin was vocally critical of Putin.   They were part of the old faction of Republicans, who were ""wAr hAwKs"", deeply patriotic, pro-military, anti-communist/Soviet, and supported interventionism.   Which Russia *hated*, as they were actually being dealt with militarily by the US.  MAGA was the entryism efforts of Russia and American business interests into the Republican party.   They rotted out the Republican party from within.  *That* was what ""normalized stupid people"" getting into politics.",chi823,2025-04-24T21:39:38,2
>loyal to country and party but unafraid to speak his mind should either go down the wrong path.  *loyal to party* is the problem. His party is evil to the core.,Professional-Can1385,2025-04-24T11:55:47,1
">""How would a Vice President Sarah Palin have accelerated the downward trend of the party?""  McCain, Palin, and the old Republican party would have dealt with Russia more strongly than Obama.   Putin *hated* them for a reason.  They may have prevented Russian election interference and propaganda warfare in 2016.    And the mess we are in today.  I say this as an Obama voter.",chi823,2025-04-24T21:43:17,1
"Russia certainly helped put the moron in charge. I'm certain that he would still be considered nothing more than a joke if Sarah Palin never got involved in national politics. Trump ran for president before Sarah Palin, and was pretty much laughed out of the race. Back then a small political gaff would be enough to torpedo a presidential campaign, ask Howard Dean. After Sarah palin, it was permissible for a politician to know nothing about politics and still have a hand in it. At the end of the day, it was John McCain's call to put Sarah Palin on the ticket and normalizes all is absurdity in politics.",mev186,2025-04-24T21:53:48,0
">""After Sarah palin, it was permissible for a politician to know nothing about politics and still have a hand in it.""  Sarah Palin is considered one of the main reasons why McCain lost.  She did not make it ""permissible for a politician to know nothing about politics"".   She was resoundingly rejected.  Even during the 2015 Primary Season, Trump was severely mocked, while the rest of the Republican field tried to maintain professionalism.  *It was not until after Trump's victory that the tide shifted.*   And ""stupid people"" began treated as actual potential threats in politics.   That was in 2016, 8 years after Palin.  So, no.   McCain did not ""normalize all absurdity"" with Palin.",chi823,2025-04-24T22:40:55,1
