"Politicians in city centers are doing the opposite, trying to get people to return to their offices to stimulate downtown economies.",gaxxzz,2022-08-08T01:02:42,20
The big money owning downtown office towers and the like might not be too thrilled with such politicians.,spacester,2022-08-07T23:53:05,9
"Individuals would save money, a lot of money, and businesses would save money on rent and office space. But local small business groups municipal governments don’t want permanent WFH.  In DC, which has a high concentration of federal workers who can all be ordered back to offices by the president, [the DC mayor’s long-held position is to get people back in offices as much as possible](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2022/03/03/dc-economy-boost-federal-workers-return) so they spend money in DC at stores and on parking.  Biden, rather than making the government a leader in how WFH can benefit everyone, including urban business owners who relied on workers’ spending money, is just trying to return to the old model of commuting to offices, which is ironic considering he works from home.",NYSenseOfHumor,2022-08-08T06:33:35,5
"It seems like not having to pay rent is a bigger incentive than the government can reasonably do. If an antiquated boss is willing to pay unnecessary rent, he ain’t gonna be swayed by a tax credit.",gsfgf,2022-08-07T20:38:47,7
"Quite the opposite. There is power and big money in commercial real estate and it has been suffering from the pandemic. They want to keep their industry making a lot of money so they lobby the government and we get President Biden a few months back saying it's time to get back into the offices and what not.   Environmental impact may be significant but there isn't money in saving the environment.  Or in saving money, time, and quality of life for the workers for that matter.",ArcherChase,2022-08-07T21:31:59,3
People want to live in cities where the restaurants are. Maybe some of the big office buildings could be converted to condos.,Short-Resource915,2022-08-08T09:15:54,2
"My son works for a think tank in DC. He can WFH, but goes in 2-3 times per week because it’s a cool building, they have good snacks, he admires his boss, and he might brush shoulders with authors.",Short-Resource915,2022-08-08T09:18:51,2
"That sounds like a really good idea, which is why I haven't heard of a politician doing that. I keep up with a lot of politics, though I admit not most. So if anyone DID propose something like this, I'd love to know about it.",ray25lee,2022-08-07T20:11:24,4
"unpopular opinion but given all the facts and what little we actually know compared to the elites, pollution is not a big deal from humans. Therefore no incentive to change behaviors to reduce pollution.  Money is not the issue either.",rurrohh,2022-08-08T10:45:59,0
The businesses that run America need people to be in office to work there.,Big_Piccolo4987,2022-08-08T15:14:33,1
"No, but there are relatively few of those.   The people who work in businesses that are supported by downtown office workers are going to be *pissed*, and lots of them are in fields where they personally can't work from home and where working from home kills their jobs- local food and drink establishments, mainly.   So you don't just have fat-cats in towers opposing this, you've also got scads of waitstaff, restaurant owners, small business owners and employees in or near downtowns, etc.",[deleted],2022-08-08T06:58:50,6
"Apparently only about [30 percent](https://dcist.com/story/16/08/24/who-lives-and-works-in-dc/) of the people who work in DC actually live in DC.   So if they basically all start working from home all the time, how is the non-government part of DC's economy not going to collapse? The notion that this could somehow benefit urban business owners in DC seems very disingenuous.",[deleted],2022-08-08T07:02:38,3
"Not to mention you could probably get away with paying less for work at home. My job can't be done from home but if I was offered one that could I'd gladly take a pay cut for it especially if it was only a $1 or 2 an hour. I'd probably take home more money after saving gas, work clothes and other BS I have to pay for to work my job.",OhTheHueManatee,2022-08-07T21:55:37,5
"Do downtown office workers actually support downtown restaurants (to continue your example)?  Don't they eat most of their food near where they _live_, not _work_?  Some of them are going to eat out at lunch, sometimes.  But it feels like people are talking about an effect that isn't real, like when people say building stadia boosts local economies.",Kumqwatwhat,2022-08-08T10:37:07,3
"The government will have a lot of now unused office space all over the country (not just in DC) that will need to be repurposed. The government (taxpayers) still owns that property, it is publicly-owned real estate in desirable, urban areas that does not need to turn a profit, it just has to break even. The government can turn these properties into the centers of walkable, mixed use urban communities.  By creating more demand to live in cities, there will be overall benefits for everyone, including the urban business owners. The government just needs to get out of the old and inefficient model of how we lived and stop trying to recreate the past.",NYSenseOfHumor,2022-08-08T07:29:23,3
"They definitely do. You are underestimating how many people buy lunch everyday. In the financial district of my city there are tons of places that close at 3pm because they exist just for the lunch rush.   Then people go downtown out after work, probably much less often but when there are tens of thousands of white collar workers its enough to fill up restaurants after work on a Friday.",Sheol,2022-08-08T11:06:00,3
"""Let's meet for food/drinks after work"". I imagine it's a thing.   But for all of that, someone's going to have to do a study.",[deleted],2022-08-08T11:13:22,2
"In my city, there's a whole office building that has an entire food court whose business relies on office workers and conventions, It is in their interest for people to be in the office.",Kevin-W,2022-08-13T23:38:35,1
"So if I'm following you, you're essentially suggesting that people move into where their offices *were*, because the office buildings will be turned into residential ones or replaced by them, which gives the local businesses continued access to those people as customers?  I suppose whether this works or not depends on the math of it. And I do mean ""works"" not ""makes workers happy"", of course. We obviously are willing to trade misery for money.",[deleted],2022-08-08T07:38:18,3
"The office buildings can be converted into mixed use buildings, part residential, with retail and office space for lease. Companies that need office space will need less, and this can fill some of that need.  >We obviously are willing to trade misery for money.  It's already owned by the government, it does not have to turn a profit. Each project just has to break even after the cost of converting the properties, and that can happen over 25 years (or more).  >I suppose whether this works or not depends on the math of it. And I do mean ""works"" not ""makes workers happy"", of course.   It would only work if people choose to move there. If people are happier living elsewhere, they won’t move into these communities. I wouldn’t want to live in one, even at a low cost, but a lot of people would. A government-owned, dense, walkable mixed use, urban community would be fuckcars wet dream. Many of those people would love to live in these places.",NYSenseOfHumor,2022-08-08T10:13:36,2
"That was my thought- even if you're going to do all this, are the people who are happily living in Virginia or Maryland going to want to move into DC, which is basically a slum with some museums amid the government buildings, cold in the winter, hot and humid in the summer?  If you're going to work remotely, work someplace nice with neighbors who don't use as much crack, right?",[deleted],2022-08-08T11:09:06,2
"There are a lot of federal properties in DC, but this plan isn't exclusive to DC. The government owns properties across the country in every major and nearly every minor city.   While I would not want to live in one of these communities now regardless of the city, I probably would have wanted to live in a dense, walkable urban area when I was 21 and 22. But that's me, there are people of all ages across the country who want this lifestyle.",NYSenseOfHumor,2022-08-08T15:23:47,1
"Functionally, what you're suggesting is massive government housing projects.  Works in Singapore, I think. I suspect it might get some pushback politically here.",[deleted],2022-08-08T16:27:53,1
