"> Civics has just been removed from so many schools’ curriculums,” McMahon said  Two things:  1. What schools removed civics? Name them.  2. As a civics teacher, you people are making it pretty damn hard when you refuse to abide by the Constitution. How exactly do you want me to teach the concept of impeachment when GOP senators publicly said they would never convict Trump regardless of the evidence? The emoluments clause in the constitution— your guy called it “phony.” Due Process? Pretty big part of the constitution yet your team says it doesn’t apply. Help me out here.",pomonamike,2025-05-07T11:17:23,22
I had no idea the Nat Cs were even talking about this stuff. I did not click the link but a google search of the phrase reveals a host of right wing end times crazies are pushing this.,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-07T11:17:09,10

"She's attacking real educational institutes, that challenge young people's minds, and praising a fake university, that creates five minute long propaganda videos on youtube. I wouldn't be surprised if she re-institutes trump university.",HelloPeopleOfEarth,2025-05-07T11:21:42,6
"I’m sorry, is all the flag waving, fire works popping, parades parading, and ribs barbecuing too secular of a 4th of July for these anti-Americans?",BrujaSloth,2025-05-07T11:20:17,2

Linda McMahon is owned by Israel so it's no surprise she wants the US o model it's independence after an ethnoreligious social holiday.   She wants the state to be the church and vice versa. First amendment be damned.,Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-05-07T11:35:22,0
"Yeah, checks out. Equivocating what would otherwise be the corniest thing to happen at a July 4th BBQ (which you’d really regret having not come up with an excuse to get out of it once it starts) to a Seder has this very real & offensive implication that Jewish people are practicing something civic, not religious, and thus suggests they’re not faithfully American (read: Christian) enough.  Fascists are wont to appropriate the symbols & language to demean & subvert others, and I can’t imagine this administration suggesting anything different.",BrujaSloth,2025-05-07T11:47:18,3
