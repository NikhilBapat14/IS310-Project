It’s probably the same deal we had before this dude rocked the boat,animalslover4569,2025-05-09T01:58:51,14
" ""We still have our 10% tariff on which will produce $6 billion of revenue for the United States,"" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.  Howard Lutnik is a know-nothing fool. Neither Trump nor his administration has ever admitted who pays for tariffs. It is we. The people.",smithpd1,2025-05-09T02:08:13,10
The firehose of horseshit from Trump never stops.,hughcruik,2025-05-09T02:52:14,4
"Awesome! We got a “breakthrough” trade deal with the UK,  you know, the place we barely buy anything critical from. But don’t worry, now I can save a few bucks on a Jaguar I wasn’t planning to buy anyway. Meanwhile, I’m still getting slammed with tariffs on actual essentials from China. But hey, at least I can pretend I’m fancy while I watch my costs go up. What a win!",prajwas2004,2025-05-09T01:47:17,5
If you bought your Rolls Royce in the last couple weeks you may have paid too much as now tariffs will be dropping to just 10%. Happy days at the country club are back again.,Nice-Lakes,2025-05-09T02:02:21,2
The deal is two weeks away.,GooglyWooglyWoo,2025-05-09T02:08:32,2
"This is the best news of the 21st Century! People can now buy a Rolls-Royce without having to pay a huge tariff. Every man, woman, and child in the United States should be totally overjoyed.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T02:48:03,2
When Trump calls it a breakthrough trade agreement you can be sure it is nothing of the sort.,crazybones,2025-05-09T05:10:27,2
But did they say please? And are couches exempt from tariffs now too?,Died_Of_Dysentery1,2025-05-09T05:44:56,2
The “breakthrough “ is that we’ll all be paying more for goods from the UK. Orange dipshit.,MakalakaPeaka,2025-05-09T06:29:09,2
"Smart move by the uk.  The Vatican appointed an American as pope – smart move to avoid tariffs.  Heard Island, has in return formally requested JD Vance to become emperor penguin.",AdCharacter7966,2025-05-09T02:28:08,2
Why is that Mark Carney (the new Prime Minister of Canada) in the picture?  He’s Canadian.,Prestigious-Ad-3086,2025-05-09T06:36:37,1
"Trump breaks something, ""fixes"" it even though it's still worse than it was before, claims victory as his supporters kneel in awe before their orange messiah.",HandsomePistachio,2025-05-09T07:55:59,1
Break stuff then get a “fixed” version that is worse than before. Claim that “fixed” version is the greatest achievement ever.,OldschoolScience,2025-05-09T20:44:02,1
"It isn’t, it’s still worse than what you had before.  You’re still paying 10% import tax on pretty much everything you buy from us except steel and aluminium, which we don’t make much of and sell even less to you. We export about 110k cars per year to you, and now instead of 0 tariffs you’ll pay 10% on the first 100k and 25% on anything above that.   There are once again zero tariffs on rolls Royce jet engines and plane parts, likely because about 15% of every f-variant fighter jet is UK produced parts.",Drolb,2025-05-09T02:16:13,13

I call it a tornado of bullshit. My mental picture of it is the dust/debris cloud surrounding the tasmanian devil in the Looney Tunes cartoons.,faster_tomcat,2025-05-09T06:35:56,1
> now tariffs will be dropping to just 10%.  Weren't they already 10%?,DaveChild,2025-05-09T04:29:26,2
"I read your entire post and my only thought was, “I wish I had money to buy a Rolls Royce”… sad",animalslover4569,2025-05-09T02:26:39,3
