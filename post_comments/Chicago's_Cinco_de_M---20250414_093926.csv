Chicago is a liberal cesspool so Iâ€™m not surprised. I used to live in Chicago and now in the suburbs so I see it up close. Democrat mayors then liberal mayors and now a very leftist mayor. Hard to believe itâ€™s still going downhill!,rigorousthinker,2025-04-14T12:19:00,-3

"Not really, itâ€™s basically limited to the city where the battle that occurred on may 5th happened which is Puebla. Itâ€™s a significant battle in Mexicoâ€™s history but not really something celebrated on a national level. Itâ€™d be as if the battle of Gettysburg was celebrated in Canada in order to have an excuse to sell whisky and drink",just_one_random_guy,2025-04-14T10:51:11,34

"Not really.  It's celebrated on the order importance of the Battle of the Almo.  More important to the people of Puebla, but isn't even a national holiday.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-14T11:15:19,7

My Dad told me in the 70's it basically became a bar holiday in border towns on the Mexican side so 18 year old's from the US would come down and get hammered on crappy cheap beer.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-04-14T18:34:46,14
