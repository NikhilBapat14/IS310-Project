In Trump 1 he was content overcharging for hotel rooms for his staff.  In Trump 2 his corruption could net him billions.  This crypto scam is next level and the Dems should be yelling from mountain tops about this.  For example with strategic investments Putin could continue to invest in Trump’s coin ensuring the value does not drop.  In exchange Trump would abandon Ukraine.  That would be a good return on investment for Putin.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-30T08:47:21,3

"So Trump put guys like “ZMoney” who ""once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls"" in charge of a World Liberry Coin, a crypto currency that funnels money to the Trump family. Zmoney pressured businesses to give $10 million and $30 million each to World Liberty. Trump gets into the white house and removes crypto fraud oversight.   Then magically...   Their ""investors"" fraud cases dissappear   Certain startup businesses have unfair advantages  Foreign investments, for example from Israel, start flowing in .   Business dealings with clear conflicts of interest are going down with the Trump family at America's expense.     This is soooo corrupt!!!! Imagine if ANYONE ELSE IN US HISTORY did this. What the frick is going on with US Republicans? This is the kind of thing they used to freak the heck out about.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-30T08:59:16,1
