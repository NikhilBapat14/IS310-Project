"The world is getting a first hand look at how 99% of high tech and start ups in Silicon Valley operate.  They are run by posers who are actually quiet bad at managing organizations and people.   Either their technical acumen got them there or their network- who they know   I've worked in tech almost my entire 27 year career and nothing that's happening here surprises me one bit.   There's a tiny fraction of tech billionaires who landed jelly side up- unbelievably lucky- in the right place at the right time..... That is what they are good at... Acting like they had more to do with their fortune outside of celestial good fortune.   They are , with very few exceptions, grotesque pigs who are indifferent to their employees or families.  This is in fact what it's like inside most tech companies.   Ive done well in tech, it can be lucrative.... But for the life of me I cannot understand why these very fortunate people are so horrible when there success is literally knowing the right people and being in the right place in time. They are street angels and house devils.  Not so Googly now is it?",goderdammurang,2025-04-25T07:21:33,3
