OSC is an executive branch department with its new head appointed by Trump....how is this independent or a watchdog?,therapistofcats,2025-04-22T09:11:44,7
"The Office of Special Counsel has told thousands of probationary federal workers that it will not pursue their complaints about their firings, according to a copy of an OSC email obtained by The Washington Post.  The decision was a reversal of the [position of the previous head of the independent office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/24/hampton-dellinger-special-counsel-filing-probationary-employees/), who was fired by President Donald Trump.  The watchdog agency said it does not have the purview to pursue the complaints made by more than 2,000 federal employees, the email said. It acknowledged that many of the workers disputed the poor performance that was cited in their removals. But the OSC said it was impossible for them to challenge the firings as unlawful.  “This is because your termination, in the context of the government-wide effort to reduce the federal service through probationary terminations, was more likely effected in accordance with the new administration’s priorities than a decision personal to you,” the email said.

The email notes the acting special counsel’s decision against pursuing claims that the terminations fall under “prohibited personnel practices,” which are forms of discrimination, retaliation or improper practices that are banned because they violate the government’s merit system.
