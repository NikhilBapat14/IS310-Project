"Our government simply wasn't designed to be tested this way. Checks and Balances only work if the branches of congress have independent interests. Pre-Trump, they would have. Even if parties had majorities, in all three branches, congress didn't just go along with what the president said.    Trump's populism changed that. Now pretty much every republican has to be a Trumper or risk getting primaries. So even if these people are like Vance and were never-Trumpers, they still have to ride the MAGA train to keep their cozy DC jobs. I don't even think it's about power, just self-preservation of comfort.    Essentially, Trump (and Bernie's tbh) populism changed the game. ",8monsters,2025-03-18T21:00:52,1295

"This is what happens when an entire political party has decided that their leader should never face any consequences for their illegal actions no matter what. When that party has power in the executive branch, the legislature, the courts, a bunch of states, and in media, then they can pretty much veto consequences.",honorable_doofus,2025-03-18T22:34:16,80
"My genuine answer is twofold:   First, everyone who opposes this stuff seems to be operating under this presumption that, at some point, there will be a hard stop somewhere. A line that, literally, cannot be crossed. Like ""Okay, he's saying all this stuff, but he can't actually go through with it. The courts will stop him."" and then the courts don't stop anything by enacting any real punishment, and people go on the news saying they'll openly defy the court, and people say ""Well, sure, but I guess nobody is putting their foot down because it's not that bad, or that illegal."" and they all wait for something, somewhere to stop things, or enact some kind of failsafe like a governor in a cars speedometer that slows you down if you go too fast.   Second, and this is the big one, I think anything that could've potentially derailed his political ambitions has been just ""not that bad"" enough to let him skate by. Things were always not nearly as bad as they could've been.The Access Hollywood tape, for example. Could've been much worse. I've heard people say much worse, for sure. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough for people to handwave it off. The pandemic, again, was only a respiratory virus that felt like the flu (that people were already familiar with) and the deaths that it caused were less dramatic than with something like, say, rabies where there's a really dramatic mental shift and a pretty dramatic death in a short window. If people were going insane in the street, refusing water, and you basically had to watch your family go feral and die in a week, that probably would not have caused the political division over vaccines. Jan 6, same thing. I think if it'd been an absolute bloodbath, if the shooting of Ashli Babbitt had caused an out and out firefight in the capital building, I think that would've been insane enough that politicians would've said okay, this is enough, we have to take a stand for it. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough in relation to what it could've been that people were not only fine with sweeping it under the rug, they basically rebranded it as a guided tour and everybody got pardoned.",Trenta_Is_Not_Enough,2025-03-18T21:18:39,79
"Because our constitution and democracy was flawed from the beginning, it was always based on trust that people would abide by their oaths and operate in good faith, and that there were enough safeguards and guardrails in place in the case that they didnt.   But they were wrong. There were numerous holes and gaps in the protections and trump has been exploiting them, literally like an idiot savant in terms of using everything to his advantage to abuse and exploit for his own personal gain.  They thought voters would care. But voters are even dumber than the cabinet and congress in terms of holding him back.",Riokaii,2025-03-18T21:31:05,61
"Because the Republicans have been working for decades to make the courts partisan and to make sure they prioritize getting their people on the bench.  Because the Biden administration thought it was still the 90's and everything was going to go back to the way it was and did not prioritize prosecuting the political actors responsible for J6, just the cultists.  Lastly, because the electorate has a very short memory and felt gaslighted when the Biden and then Harris campaigns told them the economy was just fine when they did not feel like it was fine.",SpoofedFinger,2025-03-18T21:05:12,53
"The main problem we have now, as I see it, is that the GOP has an entire network dedicated to delusional propaganda, and at least 30-40% of the nation watches ONLY Fox News, and trusts it more than any other source. So although Trump's malfeasance is a matter of public record, it will never appear that way on the only network 40% of Americans watch. (And it's not just Fox News's fault: the conservatives DEMAND to be lied to, and will start to drift away the second they don't get the news they want. Remember the Tucker Carlson warned his co-workers not to report that Biden had won the election before they absolutely had to because it would hurt Fox's stock valuation.)   My biggest fear is that AFAIK every major genocide in the modern era was caused or enabled by a dedicated news & propaganda outlet. Nazi newspapers had a regular front-page report: Today in Jewish Crime. In Rwanda, the Hutu paper had a feature: Today in Tutsi Crime.  Before he was mainstreamed, Breitbart had a daily feature called Today in Black Crime. And what is Fox News except Today In Democrat Crime?",wordboydave,2025-03-19T03:39:23,19
"The laws on the books for the past 200+ years have been passed by mostly lawmakers who get favors from the rich or are the rich themselves.  As such, there are tons of loopholes and ever growing number of loopholes that anyone who can afford lots of lawyers can abuse.  When the normal pool of loopholes started drying up for his businesses, Donald Trump went for politics to throw another wrench into the works, which were already shaky from the complexity of all the crimes he was juggling.  Laws don't exist in practice if they can't be enforced.  Enforcement won't come if it is prevented from being carried out.  Money talks and the world listens.  Ideally, Donald Trump should be properly sentenced for his crimes, but the reality is that he took advantage of the flaws in the legal system and won the game.",Storyteller-Hero,2025-03-18T21:26:27,36

That's why no human ingenuity or set of laws can get rid of him. And why he dodges every bullet. His ability to charm his followers surpasses understanding.

This country elected him again despite all that was known about what he had already done and all that he planned to do.  This is why you don’t see people in the streets. He got more votes than Kamala. Are we going to protest the will of the people?  If the voters that elected him don’t like the ass reaming they will get, they can get off their ass and protest it all themselves. We (liberals and Democrats) tried to warn everyone. We were called fear-mongers and then the country gave Dems no power at the federal level. So, good luck to everyone. Next time vote better.

"Donald Trump has been able to operate as he has because the U.S. system is not what it claims to be. What we, as ordinary citizens, experience is merely an illusion— a shadow of governance. The actual workings of the legislative, judicial, and executive branches function differently than what we are taught in school.  Wealth has become a dominant force, capable of overriding laws and due processes. The U.S. has always had oligarchic tendencies, as its foundations were laid by individuals whose true nature and intentions remain obscured by historical writings rather than absolute truth.  Black people have long recognized this reality, speaking out against systemic injustices, only to be met with brutality. It is only when white supremacy clashes with itself—when those in power turn on each other—that the illusion begins to fracture. What many perceive as the Civil War was, in essence, a struggle within white supremacy itself. That conflict laid the groundwork for the system we see today—one where power is concentrated, and democracy remains, in many ways, a performance rather than a practice.",KingOfDragons54,2025-03-18T21:41:12,7
"Speaking as an outsider who avidly looks in... it seems a systemic failure in the system across multiple levels.  1. There isn't any easy way for Americans to recall a politician - you are locked in so it seems hopeless. 2. Media loves Trump and pumped him up with billions of free coverage (right wing especially) 3. The left is disorganized- captured by centrists who only know how to virtue signal and not fight 4. your supreme court  and federal courts were captured... completely 5. Money reigned supreme  in politics and social media + money broke the brains of most people - leading to rightwing populism 6. Young People haven't suffered enough to give a fuck and fight back with full on protests.  in the end... if the US didn't have a supercharged nuclear mix of social media, unlimited money in politics, giant media orgs that saw how older people loved to fear, and a bunch of dickless virtue signallers in the center...you'd probably see more protests from the young anyways.  Right now they are too busy doing duck face to TikTok (or whatever else is new today).  EDIT: I'll also add one other thing; while people haven't suffered enough to lash out directly at Trump, the gradual erosion of the middle class (far weaker today than say 40 years ago) has led to cynical outlooks that social media also preys on.",thedabking123,2025-03-18T23:52:58,7

Even the Un-Constitutional deportations of gang members.  It's so easy to paint the Dem's as ""soft on crime"" for attacking him, he's just deporting these gang members!

"I dunno man, Trump fights through stuff.    So, awesome red thumbtack bullet points (really cool, don't know how to do that):  - The first one I think this is an insight into how Trump thinks, how he calculates how he thinks the world should work.  Biden gives an interview in the mid 2010's about threatening to have Obama hold up a billion dollars in US aid money if Ukraine didn't fire a prosecutor.  He had his reasons, but that's what happened.    Trump thinks of power the way the US Supreme Court thinks of free speech: as content neutral.  Trump thinks the president can have reasons, not particular reasons, the same way the Supreme Court thinks protesters can have slogans, not particular slogans.    As such, Trump thinks his impeachment for having wrong reasons for holding up Ukrainian military aid was a terrible injustice.  Further, and this is the striking thing that I think identifies the personality insight: the first thing he does when winning the second election is walk over to USAID, throw it up against a wall, and beat it to a bloody pulp.    What now, impeach him for temporarily withholding some aid, again?  That going to work twice?  It either works right, right now, or it's not going to work at all.    - The petty impeachment, the moot post term impeachment, strikes me as being so plainly impolitic that I can't really comprehend how anyone decided it was a good idea.    - The Washington Post, or maybe the Wall Street Journal, one of the big W's, reported that FBI agents who had seen the documents said they were not marketable, and that only thread they could see between them was genuine pettiness, Trump was throwing a hissy fit because he thought they were his.    - It's not illegal in New York to lie to the public about whether you are buying a movie script or paying a lady not to talk about a blow job.  Just like it's not illegal to lie to the public in general.  It's only illegal to lie to people involved in the transaction.  Ironically, Cohen was actually guilty of the crime Trump was accused of, not Trump.  He testified during the trial that he gave Trump a fraudulent bill overcharging him by twenty or thirty grand for his work in the Clifford (Stephanie Clifford is the lady's not stage name) contract negotiations.    - I know a lot of people read between the lines on that phone call, where ""find the fraud"" is supposed to be ""rid me of that troublesome priest.""  It's not obvious the way you all think it is.    - Are any of the foreign nationals legal residents of some sort?  If so, that's a big deal.  If they are not US citizens, didn't have a visa of any sort, etc., then yeah, if they're not in the United States the courts don't have any say over them.  I can see that becoming controversial, though.    - Roberts didn't really rule much of anything in that case.  He said we can't possibly decide what acts might qualify for immunity until we can sort out what are the core vs not core constitutional duties.  It was a very elegant can kicking.  He asked the lower courts to try to sort out what the core duties were, knowing they could be doing so until the sun burns out if no one checks back in on them.    Here's the bottom line: Article 2 of the constitution says ""The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."" It's been a sort of consensus since Roosevelt died, and especially since Nixon was impeached, that the executive power is vested in federal agencies which are administered by congressional oversight committees. The elected president has the power to make some agency appointments. It's like his power to appoint judges. But once appointed, he has no more business telling them what to do than he would telling a judge what to do.  The last man to have that power was Roosevelt, and the last two who tried to exercise it have been impeached.  The first more successfully.    That's where we're at.  I've lived my whole life with only two and a third or so branches of government, and I share in everyone's apprehension at the prospect of a solid three.  But it is what's written on the 238 year old piece of parchment, so I hope it can't be that bad.

Presently Republicans value the power they get by ignoring Trump and his various misdeeds more than upholding the law. It's that simple. Until that changes nothing can be done about us peacefully.

"Trump can get away with all of this because he's following the guidelines as they are written in the constitution and decisions made by the Supreme Court allow him to do these things. Corporations lobby (bribe) Congress to pass legislation that aligns with their interests. These laws face legal challenges and make their way to the Supreme Court where corporations advocate for decisions in their favor.   Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and Roe v. Wade being prime examples. Citizens United enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections. When money talks, everybody listens. Capitalists get their wealth from their investments and interest gained on their capital. Most of them never worked a day in their life. Studies by Forbes magazine show half the billionaires out there inherited all of their wealth. And about a third of the millionaires inherited their wealth as well. Elon Musk is a colonizer from South Africa. He's a daddy's boy and his wealth was inherited from his daddy's emerald mine, he hasn't invented anything and his first loan came from the US Department of Energy for a whopping $465 million.  Now, some of you might think this isn't very democratic and if you want to know why that is go online and search the United States Constitution PDF. Click on the three dots and select find and search the page for democracy. Let me know what you find out. And if you would like even more mental clarity, read The Federalist Papers and the correspondence of the founding fathers before and after the Constitution.  The bill of rights is up for interpretation and most of the amendments have no legal backing since the Patriot Act was passed in 2001. The 1st Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, but the PATRIOT Act allows increased surveillance and monitoring of communications, which can chill free expression. The 2nd Amendment was written for the National Guard and absolutely not meant for the American public. The 4th Amendment protects privacy, requiring warrants for searches. The PATRIOT Act introduced ""roving wiretaps"" and secret searches, enabling government agencies to bypass traditional warrant processes in certain cases. The 5th and 6th Amendments for due process and fair trial are no longer valid. The PATRIOT Act allows indefinite detention of legal citizens suspected of domestic terrorism without formal charges or access to legal counsel, violating due process rights guaranteed by these amendments. Anti-capitalist activism could be framed as ""domestic terrorism"" under broad definitions in the PATRIOT Act.  To summarize, Donald Trump gets away with everything because the United States is not a democracy and the Supreme Court has made decisions that allow him to do these things.

"It's because Democrats never had any, or enough *real* proof of anything. EVERY SINGLE time Trump was aquitted and/or let off the hook was because there simply wasn't enough proof or evidence.   There has not been a single President in the history of our country who was impeached and *removed* from office. In fact, no President has *ever* been removed from office.   \* Impeachments are silly and quite meaningless in all reality. Clinton was impeached for abusing his power to have sex with a woman half his age who worked for him but, acquitted by the Senate. Trump was impeached by the House x2 and acquitted x2 by the Senate. TLDR: Impeachments are pointless. Always have been too. They literally don't mean anything.   \* Trump had classified documents that he, who was POTUS at the time, shouldn't have had them at his home but he did. He was investigated for this and it fell flat on it's face. Meanwhile, biden had classified documents in his GARAGE while he was VP and not a single thing was done to him. It's one thing for a President to have them but there is literally NO reason for a VP to have *classified* documents at their home. EVER. Biden was let off the hook because he was deemed to be not mentally there enough to stand trial lol.  \* The hush money thing was just a joke from day 1. It wasn't about him having had sex w/ Stormy and it was never about that. It was about him having ""supposedly"" used campaign money to ""hush"" her. Which wasn't ever proved to have happened. The sex or the money used to ""hush"" her coming from campaign funds.  \* Not sure about this one tbh  \* Once a plane leaves the US, judges literally cannot dictate anything as it's no longer within US territory and no longer have any jurisdiction, so I mean... And even at that, those planes were quite literally full of cartel members, drug traffickers and horrible criminals. WHY would we want those people here anyways? He didn't ""defy"" any orders there as those orders were not made until the planes were far outside the US jurisdiction.  \* Judges do not make the laws, enforce the laws, or tell a President that he can/cannot do something that is already legal to do. Judges interpret the law. That's it. Judges can ""block"" whatever they want but ultimately, it's not illegal for POTUS to disregard a judge's ""block"" on something. Biden certainly did it multiple times, where is the outrage for him doing it?   \* Presidents have ALWAYS had absolute immunity while in office. That is nothing new. Biden was not OFFICIALLY the President - Confirmed as POTUS - until January 7th. So, Trump WAS actually still POTUS on J6.

There is something pathological about cutting programs for the people who have been investing in our social security trust that past presidents keep borrowing from our SSI Trust expecting us to pay it back. President Bush borrowed 3.5 trillion from our trust for his war for example.  My suggest is doing away with the electoral college (not needed as it’s purpose is antiquated) and getting back to public funding for presidential campaigns.

"I'm not going to give you the answer of ""Oh the Democrats are spineless cowards"" (even though I believe in that position) because it assumes that the Trump problem is just a matter of resistance and not a matter of systematic flaws that have existed in this country since its founding. When talking about politics, we tend to isolate things to just voting for one person. Often times, espscially today, it's about everything around the voting of a person (the media for example). The framers could not have imagined the world we live in today (nor should we act like they should have).    The government of the US, as was designed in the Constitution by the framers, was not designed to be tested this much by sociopaths or cult dynamics. The framers were brilliant (at the same time flawed) but assumed the people would a.) be educated enough to reject such blatant demagoguery (all politicians resort to this but still have to be competent and at least try to tell the truth) and b.) assumed that the people would continue to have the revolutionary spirit that the framers had that led to the independence of the country in the first place.     The problem that we are facing now is that, for a long time, we have taught people that there are legitimate checks and balances in our system of government (there aren't). The framers of the Constitution, despite being flawed men, were men of their word (for the most part) and respected the rule of law. This meant that there were not really any guardrails other than the assumption that humans wouldn't be dicks.   In the US, we tend to teach our Constitution removed from politics and people. This is why people who grew up on the message that this country has checks and balances and leaders who respect the rule of law are having a meltdown right now. Once you explain that the framers were not all-knowing and could not predict the rise of fascism and populism and designed a government that worked specifically for them at the time, it becomes easier to explain why sociopaths were able to step in and take over. The framers assumed that people would always value education and common sense (they were wrong).

"Because he's not ""getting away"" with ANYTHING. All he is doing is challenging the decades old power structure that exists in modern day America where big coporations, the government, and the media all collude to retain power and generate wealth.    If you want to look at it from a different perspective, the only real one IMO, its that no ""President"" or politician in general who went against the status quo, who wasn't beholden to years of corporate lobbyists influence and backdoor deals that helped them win lower elections, will EVER be regarded by the media and the big corporations as anything but the ENEMY.   Jesus Christ himself could come back tomorrow and within weeks, once the power structure recognized that their money and power were in jeopardy, would launch an all out assault in the media claiming he was the devil, a nazi, Hitler, anything to remain in power and wealth.  The advent of social media and digital information has created, and they are well aware of this and use it to their benefit, a world where public perception is INCREDIBLY easy to shape with propaganda. If something goes ""viral"", even if untrue, the damage is done.  Social media is being used to keep the sheep in the pasture by convincing people that someone who could actually help bring about positive change, is in fact the enemy and a nazi...  People have been fed such a steady diet of this propaganda for so long, that literally NOTHING will change their mind.  Its as much psychology as it is business for them.  Bottom line, if 98% of the media hates a politician, he is probably doing what's best for the little guy and not the power structure.  Its really that simple.  It amazes me that people still don't get it even though all the evidence points to it. How does he keep winning if everyone hates him?  Is America really a bunch of racist nazis?  Are we being told that because the power structure is being threatened and they need some powerful imagery to dissuade support?  If he is so bad, why do they have to lie about it so much?  You can propagandize people to a point that literally nothing that is said or done will change their opinion.... look at North Korea, they've completely surrendered to their media. Don't trust the media!!!  I'm in no way condoning everything Trump has done, quite the contrary. He is a flawed human like all of us.  The ""picture"" of a President were used to is a carefully manicured perception of a person, not a real person.  Previous Presidents would never utter a word that wasn't first tested against market test groups.  Trump fires from the hip, says alot of dumb stuff, as do the rest of us.  His ideas though, once you get past the surface crap that doesn't matter, actually make sense and could save the country from continuing on the path were on.. these ideas would never be allowed for a typical politician because they wouldn't even BE A POLITICIAN if they voiced them - they'd never get support from the power structure...  Trump is a revolutionary being labeled a nazi so you don't join the revolution.  The media said Trump was for billionaires and would raise taxes on the poor and cut taxes on the rich, HE IS NOW DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.    The media (and Biden) said Trump was going to round up black people and put them back in slavery, COME ON, DO I REALLY HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WAS BULLSHIT.  The media claims the tariffs are going to hurt to US consumer, YES, THERE WILL BE GROWING PAINS BUT ULTIMATELY ITS THE BIG CORPORATIONS THAT ARE GETTING THE BRUNT OF THE HIT (That's why they are railing against his tariffs on every channel)  The media claimed that if Trump were elected he would install himself as a King and we'd never have another election, THIS ONE ILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY BUT IT SOUNDS PRETTY ALARMIST TO ME.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PAY ATTENTION AND IT WILL BECOME VERY OBVIOUS WHY THE NARRATIVES ARE WHAT THEY ARE...  THE POWER AND MONEY (REAL CORRUPTION) CONTROL THE MESSAGE THROUGH ADVERTISING DOLLARS.  (This is coincidentally also why the only way to possibly beat them would be to create your own social media platform (Truth Social) where you cant be banned for dissenting ideas, or buy one that, under your control, can no longer censor dissenting ideas (Twitter).

Threatens to invade countries if he cannot buy them. Rich CEO attitude narcissistic arrogant. Cut out Democrat supported departments related to dei or more likely to vote Democrat.  On the otherhand, Democrats spending money on poor and not realizing that others are still homeless, mentally ill, and unemployed abused by the coroporations. Alot of them used to be anti-China and pro-business. Pelosi was pro-tariff until she realized her stocks would get hit by US companies making things in China. Bernie was pro-business at one point before switching to pro-workers. Some unions have turned into major corporations with a pyramid scheme. Democrats overly sided with dei and LGBT and went way too far. The biggest majority of voters is male and white. Guess who they voted for.  I was interested in the Forward Party under Yang but they gave up with no plan no direction being an anti-trump party.  US is in decline being in so much debt with fighting wars overseas and overly bloated bureaucracy that does not do all that it should do for its people. Open departments to solve a problem create bigger headaches with red tape and official blocking your needs and also dealing with fraud or allowing them through public spending. Symptoms of an Empire in decline. It once hoodwinked Americans with 9/11 threat about killing Osama Bin Laden to 2 wars in 2 countries: Iraq and Afghanistan that bankrupt the US. You now have war vets. Other countries won't mess with the US. Need to be a strong military to be a superpower. Need combat experience.  That being said Americans ourselves are to blame for this. The decline of unions actually looking out for people allowed businesses to have too much power. Excessive lobbying is like the rich having too much advertising power and campaign donations is a nice way to get power for who knows what they are doing. Everything ends up about making money for the sake of money. Manufacturing is not going to bring jobs back to US.

Now they are out on the streets, the sidewalks, parks, rivers, under the bridges, and vacant land. People complain about them. Wage increases do not work well in the long run because corporations raising prices harder for profit and costs. Working people are even hit harder with metrics. Illegal immigration occurs because other countries have slave labor conditions and US pays better with less slave labor like conditions.

Even Rubio has recently admitted the US may have to give up on negotiating a peace because the Russians are not falling for Trumps bullying tactics.

Maybe it’s because most of the “charges” and “scandals” are complete political theater designed to distract from Biden’s failures.  Let’s go down your greatest hits playlist:  “He was impeached twice!” Yeah, and acquitted twice. Do you know how impeachment works? It’s a political process, not a legal one.

The second was a rushed joke with zero due process, designed to punish him for Democrats’ own security failures on January 6th. Neither stuck. That’s called innocence in the real world.  “Classified documents!” You mean the exact same “crime” that Biden committed — except Biden had documents scattered across his house, garage, think tank, and who knows where else from when he was a Senator and VP (when he didn’t even have declassification power)? Trump had documents in a secured location at Mar-a-Lago, with Secret Service protection. But sure, let’s pretend it’s totally different because MSNBC said so.  “Stormy Daniels case!” It’s not a hush money case — it’s a bookkeeping technicality being spun into a felony, with an expired statute of limitations. Meanwhile, the entire Clinton campaign paid for the fake Steele dossier and reported it as “legal services.” Where’s the outrage there?  “Georgia election interference!” You mean questioning an election is now a felony? Funny how that only applies when Republicans do it. Hillary Clinton still claims 2016 was “stolen,” Stacey Abrams never conceded, and Democrats pushed fake Russia collusion lies for years. But Trump suggesting officials “find votes” — as in, identify irregularities — is somehow a crime? Please.  “Global outreach and USAID!” Trump didn’t destroy anything — he reprioritized American interests. Sorry that we stopped sending billions to corrupt foreign governments who hate us. America First doesn’t mean America Alone — it means we stop being the global ATM machine for failed regimes.  “Alien Enemies Act and deportations!” You mean enforcing immigration law? Trump actually secured the border, unlike Biden who created the worst border crisis in U.S. history. And yeah, if deportation planes are in the air, court orders aren’t going to yank them back mid-flight. That’s how law and logistics work.  “Supreme Court immunity ruling!” You do realize that ruling affects all presidents, right? So if you’re mad about it, blame the Constitution — or maybe focus on how Biden has abused executive power without consequence. Trump just exercised the same authority every president has used for decades.  “Crypto scams?” You’re digging deep now. If you’re suddenly anti-crypto, welcome to the party. But calling Trump’s NFT or meme-coin involvement a “scam” while ignoring FTX (where Democrat donor Sam Bankman-Fried stole billions and bankrolled your side) is peak hypocrisy.  And let’s not pretend Trump is the only politician ever involved in questionable business. Biden’s family literally has shell companies receiving millions from China, Ukraine, and Romania. Where’s that outrage?  Trump’s “getting away” with everything? No, he’s just not rolling over while your side weaponizes the legal system to remove a political opponent. And the only reason he’s still standing is because none of these accusations hold legal water once you remove the partisan spin.  But keep coping — because come November, voters will remember who gave them inflation, open borders, war escalation, a dying economy, and a mentally vacant President. Trump didn’t “get away” with anything. He just did a better job than the guy your party installed as a placeholder.  Want sources?

"A big reason is that people outside the left wing propaganda bubble know several details that have been kept from those within. I will list a few.  *Jack Smith tried to hide a pile of exculpatory evidence in the documents case, including a witness interview that revealed that several pallets of classified documents were essentially dumped onto Trump by the presidential records office. The paperwork equivalent of planting drugs on someone.   *The hush money case where he got those felony convictions. Sooo many things legally wrong with it. The DA magically turning misdemeanors into felonies, citing Trump had broken a federal election law, never saying which one. This was done because the statude of limitations had passed. The statude  Trump was accused of breaking required that any falsification of business records be to conceal another crime. What crime did Trump conceal? Bragg did not specify in his indictment. He brought up another law during the trial, which would have been within his authority to charge Trump with, but he did not. However, that law also required Trump to break a different law, which again Bragg never specified. The second law would have been impossible for Trump to violate because he did not submit the records until 2017, after the election.   So you have two laws being cited that both require a person to commit a root crime. Which AG Bragg never determined. And no, Paying hush money is not a crime unless it is to conceal a crime, which an affair is not.   *For the recent incident with the deportation flights, by the time the order was written, two of the flights had already landed, and the third was too far along to turn around.

"It's not just that.  Past Presidents actually respected and believed in the system and its design, the separation of powers between the branches, and the checks and balances.  Or at least they wanted to *appear* like they believed in it.  Maybe some Presidents didn't actually respect the system, but they at least paid lip service to the strength and wisdom of the foundational design.  Maybe some would seek to undermine it or gain advantage behind the scenes (e.g. Nixon), but they were still cowed when the other branches would publicly impose limits on the Presidency.  Trump doesn't care to even *appear* to respect the system.  When representatives of other departments or branches of government oppose him, he *publicly* criticizes not only their competency, but their Constitutional powers, rights, and *legitimacy*.  With his populist message he has convinced the public that the government, its design, it's institutions, and its human members cannot be trusted as reliable or legitimate - only he, the strongman, can be trusted.  When the Constitutional limits of the Presidency inevitably collide with the powers and responsibilities of other branches, those branches are afraid to actually exercise their powers because of public backlash that no longer trusts them or even the *idea* of a responsible, functioning government with checks and balances.  Government is supposed to fear the people in the sense that it should never overstep its limitations and violate the rights of the individual.  The populist strongman has corrupted this public contract, and now government fears the people in the sense that it fears actually enforcing the limitations of the President.  And so Trump runs roughshod over two centuries of law and tradition, and the other branches of government tasked with challenging that power stay silent and tacitly complicit.

"I know it's something you want to downplay in service of your ideology, but the UN recently published a report where 890 medals have been won by transgender athletes:  https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/un-study-reveals-transgender-athletes-have-won-nearly-900-medals-in-womens-competitions-united-nations-sports-lgbt-gender-identity-title-ix-athletics  And regardless of whether it was 890 or 1, it should never be a thing in the first place.   If we're going to compromise on this issue, the only reasonable thing to do would be changing the sex segregated spaces to ""female"" and ""open"". If females want to compete with males, they are free to do so, regardless of their gender identity. But males would be prevented from competing with females.   This would allow for generational talent females to compete with males to be shown to be ""the best"", while females are protected from having their ability to become champions stolen by males who aren't even close to being the best among male athletes. Lia Thomas is an example, where her rank moved from 65th on the men's team to 1st on the women's team in the 500-yard freestyle, and 554th on the men's team to 5th on the women's team in the 200-yard freestyle.  Segregated spaces have never been about some internal feeling of whether you want to be seen as a man/woman... it's always been about the inherent differences between the sexes. If gender and sex are truly distinct as gender theorists claim, then there should be no issue clarifying that the only thing that matters to the government is your sex (which cannot be changed).   As for intersex (a completely separate issue from ""transgenderism""), those disorders merely make sex difficult to discern, but not impossible. There has never been a case where an individual could simultaneously produce large and small gametes, and specific intersex conditions usually are found in one sex or the other (Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) for example is only found in males... their body doesn't respond to testosterone, so they develop female-esque secondary sex characteristics).   But regardless of whether something *looks* like something, it doesn't mean it *is* that thing. Have you ever seen the videos of things that look like ordinary objects, but turn out to be cake? AI generated videos of people that look like living humans? Looks can be deceiving. Someone can *look* like a female, but they aren't actually female. Intersex conditions make it difficult to discern the sex, but not impossible, and they are not a ""third sex"" because by definition sexual dimorphism is ordered towards sexual reproduction. It wouldn't make sense to say there's a ""3rd sex"" when it serves zero purpose in sexual reproduction. It doesn't exist.  There are 2 sexes, 0 genders, and infinite personalities.   There's no right or wrong way to be male/female or boy/girl. Telling someone they are born in the wrong body and *need* surgery and hormones to ""be themselves"" is wrong, especially when told to children who cannot consent to life altering procedures that cause permanent damage to their body (can't get a tattoo, but can go on puberty blockers that risk sterilization... A child cannot consent to sex, but they can consent to undergoing a procedure that deprives them of the ability to ever have an orgasm? No...). Adults are free to alter their body in pursuit of a self image, change their name, and ""identity"" however they want. It doesn't change their sex and that's the only thing the government cares about when saying males can't go into female sports/bathrooms/locker rooms/prisons/dorms/scholarships/etc.",Private_Gump98,2025-03-19T08:50:14,0

"You’re not wrong. Yes, the courts have occasionally pushed back on Trump’s actions. The Supreme Court ruling limiting presidential immunity didn’t give him blanket protection (even though it came dangerously close). Lower courts have also ruled against him on issues like the classified documents case and some aspects of the January 6th litigation as well as the recent Venezuelan migrant's deportation and trump defying that court order.  **BUT** — and this is the important part — Trump’s strategy isn’t about *winning* in court. It’s about **delaying** and **surviving** long enough to outlast consequences. Here’s how it’s working:  ✅ **Delaying tactics:** Trump's lawyers file endless appeals, motions to dismiss, and procedural challenges. The goal isn’t to win — it’s to drag things out past the 2024 election. If Trump wins, he can either pardon himself or order the DOJ to shut down investigations. (which of course he did)  ✅ **Weaponizing public perception:** Trump has turned every indictment into a fundraising bonanza. His supporters see legal trouble as evidence of political persecution — not criminal behavior.  ✅ **Stacking the courts:** Trump appointed over **230 federal judges** and **three Supreme Court justices** — shifting the judicial balance in his favor. Even if he loses in lower courts, the higher courts (which now lean conservative) could bail him out.  ✅ **Presidential immunity loophole:** The Supreme Court’s ruling established that a president has **absolute immunity** for core constitutional acts and **presumptive immunity** for broader official acts. This creates a dangerous gray area where Trump could argue that almost anything he did while in office is protected.  So yeah, the courts have pushed back on individual issues, but the **structural advantages** Trump has built into the system are why he’s still standing. He’s not escaping consequences because of innocence — he’s escaping because he’s playing the system better than anyone else.  This isn’t just about legal defense — it’s about **turning legal trouble into political capital**. And that’s why he keeps “getting away” with it.  Maybe the courts will hold him accountable *eventually*.",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-19T16:41:34,1

Let’s apply that to Trump:  * He hasn’t been convicted **yet** because he’s mastered the art of delay and manipulation — not because the evidence is lacking. * Just because a trial hasn’t concluded doesn’t mean the allegations are baseless. The hush money payments happened. He *did* have classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. He *did* ask Georgia officials to “find” votes. These are not theoretical accusations — they’re backed by **recorded evidence, documents, and testimony**. * Trump’s defense isn’t “I didn’t do it” — it’s “I’m immune because I was president.” That’s not innocence; that’s exploiting legal loopholes.  Innocent until proven guilty applies in court. But outside of court, we’re allowed to apply **critical thinking** and conclude that someone who’s facing **91 felony charges**, multiple civil cases, and has a well-documented history of shady dealings *probably* isn’t just a victim of bad luck.  If you’re holding out for a guilty verdict before admitting Trump’s done anything wrong — good luck. His strategy is to stall until he’s back in office, where he can make the problem disappear. That’s not innocence — that’s strategic immunity.",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-19T18:21:58,0
"Weak cases don’t usually lead to **91 felony charges** across **four separate jurisdictions,** especially when those cases are being handled by career prosecutors, grand juries, and judges across different states and legal systems. If the cases were that “weak,” they wouldn’t have gotten this far.  The **Stormy Daniels case** isn’t just about hush money — it’s about falsifying business records to cover up an illegal campaign contribution. John Edwards faced similar charges — this isn’t a new legal concept. The **classified documents case** includes photographic evidence of boxes of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago and documented efforts to mislead investigators. Even Trump’s own lawyer testified that he was instructed to obstruct the search. The **Georgia election interference case** includes a **recorded phone call** where Trump directly asks Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn the election. The **January 6th case** is based on public statements, private communications, and testimony from Trump’s inner circle — including people who resigned in protest over his actions.  So no, the cases aren’t weak. The evidence is overwhelming.  \>This is what a dictator would do.  Right, because holding a powerful politician accountable for *actual crimes* is what dictatorships do? In reality, authoritarian regimes **shield their leaders from prosecution** — they don’t investigate them. In fact, letting a former leader face criminal charges are a sign that democratic institutions are still functioning — even when it’s messy and politically charged. If anything, Trump’s attempts to use presidential immunity to escape accountability is the more authoritarian move here. And his whole ""I’ll lock up my political enemies if I win"" platform? That’s actual dictator behavior — not prosecution based on evidence.  \>Trying so many cases at once proves it’s political.  Or… maybe Trump just committed a lot of crimes? If you rob three banks, commit tax fraud, and obstruct justice all in the same year — you don’t get to cry persecution when you face multiple indictments. You face multiple cases because you broke multiple laws. That’s how the justice system works.  \>Helping the normies see through it.  If the goal was to hurt Trump politically, it’s backfired in the short term — his fundraising and poll numbers spiked after the first indictment. But that doesn’t make him innocent. It just means a segment of the population is more invested in the *narrative* of victimhood than the *reality* of criminal behavior.  The fact that Trump has turned his criminal exposure into a political advantage is a testament to his skill as a media manipulator — not evidence of innocence. If anything, it proves that his followers care more about “owning the libs” than whether or not their candidate is a criminal. So yeah — this isn’t a dictatorship or political hit job. It’s what happens when someone who’s lived his whole life above the law finally faces some consequences. Whether he actually *suffers* those consequences? That’s the real question.",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-19T18:35:49,2
"Wow, this is some weapons-grade nonsense. First off, have *you* considered that you might just be wrong? Trump absolutely broke the law, and the evidence is overwhelming.  January 6th? Are you seriously suggesting Trump was some innocent bystander? He *incited* the riot with his ""fight like hell"" speech, pressured Pence to overturn the election, and then sat back for *hours* while his supporters stormed the Capitol, attacking police and hunting lawmakers. He *knew* it was happening and did nothing to stop it — that’s criminal dereliction of duty at best, and incitement to violence at worst.  The hush money case? Oh, so because it’s never been charged that way before, it’s not illegal? That’s not how the law works. Trump falsified business records to cover up a campaign finance violation — that's illegal, period. Just because a prosecutor finally had the guts to hold him accountable doesn’t mean it’s illegitimate. If an ""average citizen"" committed campaign finance fraud and tried to cover it up with fake business expenses, they’d absolutely be charged. Stop acting like Trump deserves special treatment.  The classified documents case? A judge ruled the *special counsel* was illegally appointed — not that Trump was innocent. Trump still *knowingly* took classified documents, refused to return them, lied about it, and obstructed justice. And comparing it to Hillary or Biden? Laughable. Biden and Clinton *cooperated* and returned the documents. Trump actively hid them and lied. That’s why he was charged, and they weren’t.  And the whole ""lawfare"" narrative? Please. Trump isn’t a victim — he’s a serial criminal finally facing accountability. Jack Smith wasn’t ""timing"" anything — Trump's team dragged things out with delay tactics to push it closer to the election. If Trump’s innocent, why was he so desperate to avoid a trial before people voted? This isn’t some grand conspiracy — it’s Trump being held accountable for his criminal behavior.

"The reason Trump has been under investigation is because he’s actually *done* things that warrant investigation. The Mueller Report confirmed Russian interference in the 2016 election — even if it didn’t result in criminal charges. The classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were held illegally — something even Bill Barr (hardly a left-wing shill) acknowledged. This isn’t a witch hunt — it’s consequences for actions. Yes, impeachment is political, but the *evidence* behind both impeachments was very real. Pressuring a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political opponent is abuse of power. Inciting a mob to storm the Capitol is insurrection. The only reason he wasn’t removed? Senate Republicans prioritized party loyalty over accountability. When you say ""Biden did it too"" that's false equivalence. Biden voluntarily cooperated with the National Archives and the DOJ, and he wasn’t accused of obstruction. Trump, on the other hand, ignored subpoenas, lied to investigators, and stored top-secret documents in a ballroom and a bathroom. But sure, it’s “the same thing.”  \> Stormy Daniels case is a bookkeeping error.  That “technicality” involved falsifying business records to cover up an illegal campaign contribution. Also, campaign finance violations have landed other politicians in jail (see: John Edwards). If it’s no big deal, why was Trump so desperate to hide it?  \> Georgia election interference — questioning an election isn’t a crime.  Asking questions isn’t illegal. Calling the Georgia Secretary of State and telling him to “find” votes that don’t exist *is*. That’s the definition of election interference. Trying to submit fake electors is also not “just questioning.”  \> Alien Enemies Act and deportations.  You don’t get to selectively enforce court orders based on convenience. That’s literally authoritarian behavior. If Biden had done this, you’d be screaming about tyranny — but Trump doing it is just “law and logistics”? Okay.  \> Supreme Court immunity ruling applies to all presidents.  And that’s exactly the problem. The ruling effectively says that a president can commit crimes while in office and face no consequences unless Congress impeaches him. So yeah, it sets a dangerous precedent — and Trump is already exploiting it.  \> Crypto scams  Trump’s NFT and meme-coin grift isn’t just morally dubious — it’s potentially illegal under SEC guidelines. And bringing up FTX is a nice deflection, but last I checked, Sam Bankman-Fried is in prison, and Democrats aren’t rallying around him as a political martyr.  \> Biden’s family business.  If you’ve got actual evidence that Biden committed crimes, by all means — present it. Republican-led committees have tried (and failed) to find a smoking gun. Hunter Biden’s shady deals? Sketchy? Yes. Legally actionable? Apparently not — since even the GOP-controlled House hasn’t managed to make a credible case. You say Trump isn’t “getting away” with anything — but the fact that he’s still running for president despite being charged with *91 felonies* suggests otherwise. And if the best defense is “but what about Biden?” then maybe the facts aren’t as solid as you think.  But hey, you keep coping too.

"Yea honestly the 2nd time has been the most disturbing too me. The first time I really started to lose hope was in the republican primary. When primary voters voted for him overwhelmingly despite Trump not even respecting them enough to participate in the debate I thought “wow these republican voters don’t even respect themselves”, and it was the first time I had to actually wonder if these people even have the same basic values I do like democracy, rule of law, etc. like they would’ve gotten all their conservative policies with Desantis or Haley but for some reason it had to be Trump and I think it’s because they feel a loyalty to this one guy rather than actual policies or an ideology.  Like I don’t care how charismatic they are but if Obama or Bernie refused to debate in the primaries there’s no chance I’d vote for them as that would show they don’t even respect me as a voter to even try to convince me to vote for them. I often wonder if many Americans don’t even want a constitutional republic as that requires work and being knowledgeable about government and keep up with not just the president but your congressman, senator, mayor, etc. and would prefer a king to do everything. I don’t think many will admit it but I think a scary amount of Americans do just want a king like figure. The cultish devotion to trump is just something I’ve never seen in my 30 years of living in the USA.

The legislative branch can impeach the president, but they are not currently getting enough votes to impeach it seems.  The judicial branch can check the executive branch by making court decisions if the executive branch (or the president, as is happening right now) does something unconstitutional. However, the problem we are facing right now is that the president is openly disobeying court orders or making excuses as to why he couldn’t follow a court order.  The issue currently is that the president is violating the law and the judicial branch has never had a president that has openly violated a court order, so their hands are kind of tied while they figure out what to do.

"You’re not actually engaging with the substance of the argument — you’re just trying to frame it as ideological bias, so you don’t have to confront the evidence.

It’s not “faith” to conclude that Trump broke the law when **multiple judges** and **independent prosecutors** have ruled that his actions warrant criminal charges. And It’s not “progressivism” to think that asking a state official to “find votes” is illegal — it’s just reading the damn statute. You want to compare this to evolution? Okay, sure. Evolution is supported by overwhelming evidence across multiple scientific fields — biology, genetics, paleontology. Denying it requires willful ignorance.  Likewise, Trump’s legal exposure is supported by mountains of evidence — documents, recordings, witness testimony, and public statements. Denying it requires the same level of willful ignorance.  If anything, the “faith-based” position here is the unwavering belief that Trump is somehow always the victim, despite a career-long track record of corruption, fraud, and obstruction.

His secret service didn't let him walk with the people because they had observed weapons in the crowd, and informed him about it, so we at least know that he knew there was certainly the potential for things to get out of hand.   Now when you look at all the behind the scenes scheming, send fake slates of electors to various polling stations, and attempts to compel lawmakers to commit voter fraud so he could overturn a democratic election, it was an attempt at a coup. An attempt that utilized the chaos of the riot to delay the vote in order to see if any lawmakers would go along with his plan. This is why he sat and did nothing for hours as it unfolded, he was hoping that some Republicans would cave to his pressure and give him the win. If you read all of the texts that were sent to him by family members and White House staff pleading with him to do something, and he just didn't, you get a much better insight into what was going on in his head.   When you go further and read the texts between conservatives (Meadows, Jim Jordan, Giuliani, Hannity, etc.) that were uncovered by the Jan 6th committee, it gets even more eerie, because there were certainly people who knew what the plan for the coup was ahead of that day. It's wild so much time is wasted talking about the speech when so much subterfuge was happening behind the scenes. You also forgot to mention that Trump attempted to pressure a Georgia state official to commit voter fraud. There is so much evidence against Trump from that day that his legal team appealed to SCOTUS not saying they didn't try to coup the government, but saying they had the right to do it. And SCOTUS bizarrely granted the president immunity, making it impossible to prosecute the first time there has been a direct attempt to overturn the peaceful transfer of power in the US. I mean, you can't make this stuff up; never in my lifetime could I have imagined this would happen...And they don't deny it. The Democrats dropped the ball so hard on not staying on the insanity that was January 6th, and today, hardly anyone knows what actually happened.",MSD101,2025-03-23T13:25:09,1
"The report explicitly stated that it *did not exonerate* Trump. In fact, it laid out multiple instances where Trump *likely obstructed justice* but noted that charging a sitting president wasn’t within Mueller’s authority. The Department of Justice’s policy (thanks to a Nixon-era memo) prevents the indictment of a sitting president — which Mueller directly cited as a limiting factor. Mueller’s team found *sweeping and systematic* Russian interference aimed at helping Trump win the 2016 election. The reason they didn’t charge Trump with criminal conspiracy was because they couldn’t establish a direct agreement between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. That’s different from saying there was “zero evidence.” For example:   📌 Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, handed sensitive internal polling data to Konstantin Kilimnik — a known Russian intelligence operative.  📌 Donald Trump Jr. met with Russians in Trump Tower, explicitly expecting “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.  📌 Trump publicly asked Russia to “find” Hillary’s missing emails — and within hours, Russian hackers started targeting Clinton’s servers.  📌 Roger Stone acted as a middleman between Trump and WikiLeaks to coordinate the release of hacked DNC emails.  Mueller listed at least **10 separate incidents** where Trump obstructed the investigation or attempted to. These included:  * Trying to fire Mueller. * Telling White House counsel Don McGahn to lie about that attempt. * Dangling pardons to witnesses to influence their testimony. * Pressuring Jeff Sessions to limit the investigation’s scope.  Mueller’s team concluded that Trump’s conduct met the legal definition of obstruction — but they followed DOJ policy that prevents indicting a sitting president.  So, did Trump *collude*? Not legally provable. Did he benefit from Russian interference? Absolutely. Did he obstruct justice to cover it up? Indisputably — but he was protected by the technicality that a sitting president can’t be charged.  In other words: Trump didn’t walk away clean. He just managed to run out the clock.  But sure, keep pretending the Mueller Report was some kind of “total exoneration.” Maybe actually *read it* next time instead of just parroting Fox News talking points. 😉",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-18T23:17:48,5

"First off, that ""Legal Expenses"" label? That’s the entire problem. The payment wasn’t for legal services—it was reimbursement for hush money payments. Falsifying business records isn’t about what “fits in the check’s tiny space,” it’s about misrepresenting the purpose of the expense. Any competent lawyer—well, one who isn’t desperately spinning for Trump—knows this.  Now, onto your laughable claim that because the records were submitted in 2017, they couldn’t have affected the election. That’s not how election interference works. The crime wasn’t about when the records were filed—it was about the cover-up of payments meant to silence a damaging story before the election. That’s deception to mislead voters, which is precisely why it falls under campaign finance violations.  And since you’re so desperate for a specific law citation, let me spoon-feed it to you. The relevant federal statute is 52 U.S. Code § 30109, which governs campaign finance violations. The idea that “Bragg never cited a law” is another right-wing fantasy—he referenced state law against falsifying business records (NY Penal Law § 175.10), which becomes a felony when done to conceal another crime, in this case, a campaign finance violation. No, Bragg didn’t have to charge Trump with a federal crime—he only had to show that Trump falsified records to cover up a separate illegal act, which he did.  So, yes, an “amateur” like me just did what Bragg, a whole team of lawyers, and a jury did—laid out why this was a crime.",Master_Principle2503,2025-03-20T23:10:07,1

"I think the reason why McConnell is so universally despised is because he's different from ALL the rest of us - Bernie, leftists, Democrats, Republicans, MAGAs, even Trump himself.  Everyone in that list believes in SOMEthing, whether it's maximizing opportunity for all or maximizing wealth for Trump.  There is SOMEthing that everyone else above stands for.  But McConnell just stands for ""Republicans"".  No, NOT the GOP.  The ""Republicans"" he led in 2014 were not the ""Republicans"" he kneeled to in 2024, but he supported both equally.  He supported a ""ticket"" that was radically against many things he believes in.    He stands for only the literal name itself.  Everyone else stands for a value or principle - Mitch stands for a single word.  I think this is also why he freezes up on occasion.  We distract ourselves with our principles, and live our lives in spite of the fact that we are but dust, and to dust we must someday return.  And that's the right thing to do!  If there's no external value to our lives, there's nothing keeping us from creating the value for ourselves.  We give the world meaning.  But Mitch has embraced the emptiness and futility so utterly that he has no shield when it comes calling.

His lust for short-term power destroyed his legacy!  His entire life's work he was successful at meeting his evil goals and building his evil GOP empire and executing his plans.     But by not impeaching Trump, everything he worked for got stolen from him and his cronies, and went to Trump.  It's like in breaking bad >!when the Nazis kill Hank and stole all the money!<  He hates Trump and Trump hates him.  Again, Mitch prides himself on being a supervillain.  But he let himself get defeated right before the end of scene.  This absolutely torments him at night.  Not only does he care, but he really really cares and knows very much how badly he fucked up.   But he's too much of a spinless prick to ever come out of his fucking turtle shell and admit it.  Which would give him a small speck of redemption.    Mitch and his establishment GOP ilk also hate Putin and Russia too.  Establishment GOP loves being the wealthiest people in the most powerful and wealthy country in the world. It gets them high to have that status.  And thus, they are against anyone who will take that away.  Like Putin, who wants to steal America's power and wealth.    But Mitch knows now that because of his cockiness in 2021, Putin now has an upper hand on America with Trump in the White House.   These politicians aren't like you or me.   They are very concerned with their legacy.  They want to live forever.  It drives everything they do.  Mitch fought for and led the team of ultra powerful wealthy conservative white Americans. The ""old money"" of the country.     He did so successfully for decades where he schemed and undercut and executed his plans to considerable success.  Democrats wish they had a political talent like him.     But he got cocky and because of that completely screwed his legacy at the end, and made his life's work pointless. MAGA took over his team.  And he'll be bitter at himself over it until the day he dies.    I would be happy about this, since I hate Mitch McConnell, except for the fucking fact that MAGA is **even more destructive** and threatening to the middle class than the neo-cons were.

Trump's populism appeals to the common blue collar worker who is upset with the lack of change in their lives. Bernie's does the same, but what they want to do is two totally different engines.    Trump wants to engage in far right policies, Bernie wants to bringing democratic socialist ideals into the fold, but the methods of firing up a pissed off base of common people is similar.    Bernie's effect is a drop in the water compared to Trump's but I still believe it had an non-negligible impact on both the 2016 and 2020 elections, especially how the DNC screwed Bernie in 2020.

Unfortunately, most Americans don't care much about climate change, foreign policy (as long as we're not at war), LGBTQ issues, or Gaza.

"I'll try to keep it short since I've had this argument many times on reddit already  Paying hush money is not a crime, not declaring campaign spending is a misdemeanour, and the president is allowed to declassify and take presidential records. So turning those into felonies requires threading a politically motivated needle. Bragg combined a non-crime (paying hush money) with a misdemeanour (which it's debateable he's even guilty of since paying it can exist outside of a campaign, and he could claim personal reasons to pay her off) into a felony by claiming it's election interference in a total novel way, because he was obviously using whatever tactic he could to get his political win.  Trump probably shouldn't have had that phone call, but it requires putting intent into his words, you can say ""find votes"" on a phone call and not in that way, and just have it be a poor choice of words. Overall putting him in jail for that seems like a stretch. Another thing that seems fine worthy, maybe.  There was that one claiming it's overvaluing Mar a Lago when it's not only a massive property but now famous and part of political history and therefore there is tons of ultra rich conservatives or Saudis or whatever that would pay for it for the prestige. Because the judge wanted to get Trump, she claimed its value is only based on the revenue it makes instead of what people would pay for it, which is ridiculous.  On J6 he organized a protest, told them to march peacefully and then sent tweets or videos telling them to go home while the breach was happening.  These are all weak AF, the left just doesn't care because they think Trump in jail is a net positive to society for other reasons so they would take Al Capone arrested for taxes type of move.

Despite recognizing Trump's moral failings and the threat he posed to democracy, McConnell repeatedly chose party interests over national welfare.

McConnell's approach of denouncing Trump's actions while simultaneously enabling his power grab exemplifies the cynical strategy adopted by establishment Republicans to deal with Trumpism. This shortsighted tactic allowed Trump to consolidate his grip on the GOP, erode democratic norms, and potentially evade accountability for his actions.

That is to say, the Supreme Court can make rulings, but they've always relied on others to enforce them. That wasn't a problem in the past, as the courts legitimacy made not-cooperating with them an illegitimate action itself.  That began to change in the 1930s, sped up in the 60s and 70s, and over the past 100 years, the Court has made enough decisions that are serious reaches (Wickard v Filburn imo) or seriously controversial (Row v Wade), that the label of ""activist judges"" has stuck. This was coined by the Republican Party, and at this point, I think any Supreme Court ruling against Trump would be viewed as illegitimate.

"It absolutely was about slavery: the principle cause of the Civil War was the dispute over whether slavery would expand into the western territories. For decades Congress kept the peace by admitting new states in pairs: one slave state, one free state. That prevented either side from dominating the Senate and the House. The entire history of the mid-19th century is driven by the increasingly violent conflict over admitting new states to the union. Bleeding Kansas, the Missouri Compromise.   South Carolina seceded because of slavery. [Their secession document makes it plain the slavery was their sole reason for leaving the union](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Immediate_Causes_Which_Induce_and_Justify_the_Secession_of_South_Carolina_from_the_Federal_Union). They were convinced that Lincoln's election spelled the end of slavery. The other states [said much the same)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Category:Confederate_States_of_America_documents. Here's Mississippi:    * ""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world.""  The Republican Party platform was [filled with descriptions of slavery as a moral evil](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1860) and made clear its goal to prevent its spread into new territories (thereby ensuring its eventual abolition).   Lincoln spent months trying to avoid civil war, and only went to war after cadets from The Citadel in South Carolina fired on relief ships headed to Fort Sumter. He initially had no plans to abolish slavery in the slave states, even allowing Kentucky and Virginia and any other states to remain in the Union with their slaves. (Such a policy would have been hugely controversial in the North, at least before years of war changed millions of minds.) But he absolutely did intend to prevent expansion of slavery into the west, thereby dooming its future.   TL;DR - Don't believe whatever pseudohistory you may have heard.

"Trump and Sanders were putting up similar vote shares in the 2016 primaries.  Trump had a field crowded with establishment Republicans, splitting their vote, and benefited immensely from the RNC's winner take all rules.  Sanders had just Hilary because it was her turn or some shit and even if there was a field crowded with establishment Dems the DNC goes with proportional delegates.  They had the same amount of support so it's not like progressivism couldn't see a similar rapid growth in support.  Voters are livid with establishment Dems right now.

"Because they literally forced their way in, almost crushing a police officer to death, there is literally a video where the police are pushing against the crowd but an officer at the front is getting crushed and screaming in pain. You can literally see his face in the video. Idk why people forget this. A few officers that sustained injuries (can't remember if they were head injuries or not) actually committed suicide days after j6 as well. They let them in because the police didn't have enough bodies to keep them out. Why risk getting killed at that point? They were out numbered. A police officer even got shoved into the crowd where someone actually stole his gun, then immediately more people noticed he was in the crowd and were about to attack him but luckily someone stepped in to shield from the crowd him. This was all on his body camera footage. That shit was far from peaceful. All of those officers gave statements, and it was aired on the news. There was footage of everything that happened, absolutely everything. Even a protestor getting shot while trying to make his way to where the officials in the building were. There was a door that was shut that separated them from the crowd. I can't remember if they pried the door open, or if the door had glass and they broke it, but one person made it through and someone in a suit that was waiting in case they broke through, immediately shot them.",lewis_swayne,2025-04-07T18:10:05,1

These interactions, as detailed in the Mueller Report, highlight the various contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian individuals or entities during the 2016 election period. While these contacts were documented, the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign    Edit to add: the important bit to remember here is that Mueller didn't find Trump innocent or guilty.  In fact he didn't that was his call and was up to congress so put it to them.  Mitch McTurtle basically said ""bro this dude is so guilty that he should go to prison so let's let that play out"" but the Supreme Court stepped in and said ""dude, Trump is above the law"".

"You think its too late already. I dont want to be this pessimistic yet. I have hope that the people will reflect and recognize whats going on.

I have faith that in America its the same and the people wont fall for the facists.

"> I have hope that the people will reflect and recognize whats going on.  Ok, but that requires each group to recognize what the other side thinks of as grievances, and that seems unlikely in the current political atmosphere.  You mention Germany, which I'm tangentially interested in because I did six years of German in HS/college (it's horribly rusty nowadays though) and spent 3 weeks there 20 years ago.  > I think we all learned from history.  I don't think you have. Or, rather I imagine you're hyper focused on one part of history. I think the lesson you learned is that you need to resist fascism. I don't think you've learned to avoid the conditions in Weimar Germany that made fascism desirable to the populace.  My understanding of the current division behind the rise of the AFD is that east Germany feels like it was exploited by west Germany after reunification. You can see this in metrics like # of CEOs from east Germany, or what percentage of rents in east Germany go to west German landlords. And support of the AFD is roughly double in east Germany.  My reading of history tells me that divide and conquer works *amazingly* well on societies with a built-in line of division like that. Specifically the period of British colonization of India is what informs that. There are ways around that, but they often involve pushing a strong national identity, effectively converting those grievances into a position of honor for contributing to the nation. This is 1) the opposite of the way Europe has been going for some time, and 2) very taboo in Germany for historical reasons.  Just like the British managed to colonize a country with way more people using a military tech advantage, I don't think Russia will have that many problems colonizing a more economically prosperous nation with their comparative advantage in psychological warfare.",Sarmq,2025-03-23T11:13:50,1
"Thanks for mentioning that you went there 30 years ago that makes it easier to understand your perspective.  ""I don't think you have. Or, rather I imagine you're hyper focused on one part of history. I think the lesson you learned is that you need to resist fascism. I don't think you've learned to avoid the conditions in Weimar Germany that made fascism desirable to the populace.""  I agree with you, our politicans in power dont focus on the problems of the not priviledge ones. The east/west division is in my opinion not the main problem. It is highly critisized that the media tried to frame the rise of the AFD as an only east german problem. Many people left the east so there is much space, less dense population. The extreme right saw that and decide to settle there and build nazi communities. Thats the reason why the right are stronger in the east. They also try to influence the normal population with their ideas, like the front national in France, they talk more face to face, like Hitler did.   One politician from the green party admitted that they had no public debate about the AFD and their topics, cause when you dont pay attention to the problems, the narratives that come with such topics don't get burned into people's minds. They dont want to support stereotypes. Now they say it didnt help and their take was wrong.   In media there is every year a big east/west survey but last year they said it might be the last time cause the divison is dated and enhances stereotypes. The other problemes you mention are not only to the east. You can find these left behind areas everywhere in Germany. In my bubble no one thinks in categories of east and west anymore thats outdated to my generation. The only time I heard the term east west in discussions from someone in my age were 2 people from Berlin. But I myself live close to switzerland and even my grandparents never really cared about the east cause its 800km away.  Like I see it, the rise of the fascist here, have similar reasons to the US. People are afraid of mass immigration and the culturally challenges overwhelming us. The AFD is rising cause they said to the immigrants that live here ""the new people that will arrive, will take your jobs so you have to vote for us we protect your jobs"" basically the same Trump said to the Latinos.",Realistic_Isopod513,2025-03-26T09:10:02,1
