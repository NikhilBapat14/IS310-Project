"""...first-quarter profit beat market estimates and the parcel delivery giant said it will cut 20,000 jobs"".  If Trump was not in office... This sentence would be bat shit crazy to see.",williamgman,2025-04-29T09:45:32,1

">“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tome said.  It's truly awful. I mean, seeing a company like UPS, so important to our supply chains, having to resort to job cuts and network reconfiguration just shows how precarious things are, especially when you consider that Amazon made up nearly 12% of their revenue in 2024, just showing how risky it is to put all your eggs in one basket. A situation like this just shows how much we need to support American workers and businesses, so this doesn't keep happening... it's just really depressing.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-29T09:32:39,1
"It's honestly just sickening how reliant UPS was on Amazon, like, 11.8% of their revenue came from them, so it's no surprise they're cutting 20,000 jobs now because of it.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-29T09:47:22,1
The ripple effects will keep growing until even one of Trump's dumb reversals won't stop the crash.,zubbs99,2025-04-29T09:49:58,1
"What does buy American even mean anymore, what do we really produce here? It’s not like the 1920’s or 1950’s even where we actually produced a lot of products in our country, the world has changed so much.  We need to realize we can’t be an isolated country.",Handyhelping,2025-04-29T09:49:45,1
"Shit was fine pre ""tariff wars"", just saying. Buying stuff on Amazon was supporting Americans who work in logistics.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T09:38:32,1
