"This bill doesn’t “protect women and children”. It just hurts trans people.   I’m a woman and I want trans women in the ladies where they belong and where they are safer.   Also, having trans guys having to use the ladies bathroom is just confusing and lays it open for actual sexual predators to go into a women’s bathroom claiming they are trans man when they aren’t. As things usually stand if someone who looks like a guy comes into women’s spaces we can shoo them out. This bill requires even fully transitioned trans men to go into the ladies room, and trans women to walk into a rest room potentially alone and vulnerable with men. It’s all just stupid.",Limberine,2025-04-25T08:30:09,1
Dumb and pointless.  What we need is a law that requires businesses and public areas to remove urinals and add stalls if they switch to gender neutral bathrooms.

"The typical conservative mindset is ""I am normal, therefor everyone is like me. Everyone thinks and acts like me. Any deviation from me is just a delusional liar. So trans people must be doing what I would do if I put on a dress. Use it to sneak in and rape people. It's the only Logical reason.""   It's the opposite of empathy.

They dont care about trans men that much. They barely acknowledge that trans men even exists. It's the trans women they want disappeared. The bulk of their hatred and anger is directed towards any cis-man or any person assigned male at birth who doesn't conform to the stereotypes and expectations of that male gender assignment. There is no flexibility. They view non-conformity as a threat to society.,InsideAside885,2025-04-24T20:40:37,7
