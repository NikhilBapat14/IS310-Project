"Instead of inventing a lot convoluted and contrived rules to accomplished their goal, why don't the white people in Wyoming just make it a crime for anyone besides white people to vote?   Okay, illegal for anyone but white men to vote.   Okay, okay, okay, illegal for anyone but Republican, heterosexual white men with money to vote.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-07T14:32:37,3

"I'd go the other way, honestly. Let them vote but only on the standard pink ballot. If you're a rugged white male Republican you can ask for a white ballot which is less likely to spontaneously catch fire. That way everyone has a right to vote and you can dispense with all the complaints.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T14:52:49,1
