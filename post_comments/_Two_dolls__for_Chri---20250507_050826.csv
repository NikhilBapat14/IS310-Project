"A bit from the commentary:  > it seems obvious that Trump is working off instructions, likely given by his ever-present aide/manager Stephen Miller, to keep the focus on dolls and maybe ""pencils,"" which he brought up with Welker. Either way, the telling detail is that the only children Trump will talk about are girls. Boys aren't mentioned. Neither are toys more stereotypically associated with boys, like Legos or toy trucks. This is likely not an accident, but part of a larger effort to sell the otherwise indefensible tariffs to the MAGA base by invoking the same misogynist resentment that helped Trump get elected.  >  > A little over a month ago, Trump superfans on X started arguing that the tariffs were the key to restoring male dominance. They falsely claim that tariffs will drive women out of the workforce and force them to get married to survive. ... >  > Fox News picked it up, and tried to argue that tariffs will restore the patriarchal gender order by bringing back manly manufacturing jobs, while destroying ""email jobs"" that are primarily held by women in MAGA fantasy version of reality. The opposite, however, is what's happening: Trump's trade war is shutting down American factories that need foreign-sourced materials, as well as devastating other ""manly"" blue-collar jobs like truck driving and farming. But the gender resentments Trump taps into were never about facts, but about giving Trump's male supporters a scapegoat for all their self-inflicted woes: women. Or, with the ""doll"" gambit, girls. Guardian columnist Moira Donegan joked about this on Bluesky,  ""As we all know, the only workers who ever produce anything are men, and all women are exclusively parasitic consumers (men do not consume). This is how the economy works in the right wing symbolic order. """,zsreport,2025-05-07T05:11:03,48

How many sets of legos can the boys get???    Do they only get 5 pencils as well???   I really want someone to parody this by making their daughters 30 cornhusk dolls and then giving their sons legos while opening Christmas gifts.  ,North_Zookeepergame4,2025-05-07T05:23:28,11

Sexism? I’ve heard this quote in lots of contexts. Sexism is a weird angle to push. I assume it’s a democrat stratsgist.   He’s resorting to “you’ll be poorer and you’ll thank me for it” to sell tariffs,CoachCrunch12,2025-05-07T06:21:35,-14
"I'm a woman and I actually work in manufacturing as an engineer lol.  Sorry boys we still have manufacturing jobs too.  I noticed this before and alot of the maga chat that women being allowed basic rights like voting and employment were the cause for such a left leaning political environment and the deficit.  Not true.  This was caused by people who decided instead of paying their fair of taxes, they would use things like diversity to turn the countries attention there. Some people are happy to have someone to hate especially if they're an easy target. ",arilupe,2025-05-07T05:35:46,36
LEGO announced a US factory in 2022 but it won’t be completed until 2027. If tariffs stay until manufacturing comes to the States then every Christmas will be ruined for many years to come.,loveispenguins,2025-05-07T06:44:57,12
