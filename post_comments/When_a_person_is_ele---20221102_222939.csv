"The answer here is nuanced. Of course state level stuff does factor into the national policy positions. Folks often get it backwards, but party platforms are determined based on what voters want to see. It's very hard for politicians to get voters to care about something they don't want to care about. It's very easy for voters to get politicians to care about something they didn't care about before. And obviously this grassroots perspective has go from voter->local organization->state organization->national organization.  But is it formulaic? Of course not. There's no mathematical equation here that perfectly explains how much influence is there. Some state level politicians are only state level politicians because frankly they're not talented enough to be more than that. Those folks may not always be able to have as much influence as someone else. But also the most talented state level folks tend to move up to federal office.  In short, broadly, yes, of course, lower level party folks do contribute to the national platform. A national candidate cannot afford to disregard the state level stuff happening, certainly. But is there a clearly precise amount this can be measured? Not really.",mormagils,2022-11-03T09:32:45,1
