"Pete Buttigieg is putting the podcast microphones aside and [heading out on the road](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/politics/pete-buttigieg-iowa-town-hall?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit).  The former Transportation secretary, who in March passed on a run for a US Senate seat in Michigan — guided by what people close to him confirmed was interest in a possible second presidential bid — will be in Iowa on May 13, CNN has learned. He’ll headline a town hall with the group VoteVets Action Fund that will be his first public in-person event since finishing his Cabinet job with the Biden administration in January.  Since Democrats moved away from using the Iowa caucuses as their first presidential nominating contest after the 2020 election, the state is no longer as critical for a White House race. But Buttigieg’s decision to head back to the state where he narrowly won the caucuses in 2020, and to make that trip in coordination with a group that focuses on veterans, is still meant to be a tease at a time when prospective 2028 Democratic presidential candidates have started stepping out more.  It’s also a shift for Buttigieg, who spent the first few months of Donald Trump’s return to the White House making a flurry of media appearances, from appearing on Stephen Colbert’s late night show to provide a live response to the president’s address to the joint session of Congress to spending three hours on the “Flagrant” podcast, making him one of the first potential 2028 Democrat to head into the “manosphere” outlets which were a core part of Trump’s strategy last year. He’s also appeared on podcasts hosted by NPR and “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart along the way.",cnn,2025-05-01T12:12:15,3

We're just gonna get force-fed this corporate nerd because the party so aggressively shuts down progressive candidates that there's almost no one with actual name recognition besides AOC.,Ozark_Toker,2025-05-01T12:21:06,-1
"He did come in second in the Iowa caucuses in 2020. First, if you go by delegate equivalence instead of just raw votes, so it makes sense for him to go to Iowa.    I would take a Pete Buttigieg instead of whatever the RNC comes up with in 2028.",Round_Ad_1952,2025-05-01T12:38:25,4
Progressives accusing other people of force feeding us candidates is really funny.,Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-01T15:09:33,4
"Democrats should pick a candidate to actually get excited about instead of a former McKinsey consultant that's ""better than the Republicans"".   He's a younger copy of Hillary Clinton and isn't any change from the Democratic Party of the last 40 years.   Democrats have lost two presidential elections to Trump running this type of candidate and would have lost a 3rd if it weren't for COVID.",rtd131,2025-05-01T13:41:52,-5
"You would take Buttigieg, but would enough other general election voters?  Having a husband has to affect his electability.",aleph32,2025-05-01T13:40:48,-2
"Hillary came very close to winning and probably would have if if she had a better strategy.      Pete, looks like he has her advantages and none of her disadvantages. ",Round_Ad_1952,2025-05-01T15:00:37,1
"Iowa is a very conservative, very white, very rural State.    And Bernie Sanders and Pete basically tied with Biden being a distant fourth.    But Pete did not do well in South Carolina, and I'm guessing he would not have done well in the South because traditionally African Americans won't vote for a gay man.    African Americans are a key constituency of the Democratic party though, so apparently gay people should just not look forward to being Democratic presidential candidates. ",Round_Ad_1952,2025-05-01T14:59:41,3
"Came very close to winning doesn't mean anything - she still lost.   All of Pete's views are the same as the Clinton's, Obama's etc. It's time for the party to move on and pick a candidate who sticks up for the working class and not wall street.   Run Pete in 2028 and say hello to President Don Jr.",rtd131,2025-05-01T15:09:10,1
