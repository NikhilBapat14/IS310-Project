"Republicans should be worried about the midterms, because democrats have a large base of active and tuned in voters, while republicans now have a base where many of their voters only love and will vote for Trump.   It’s the same thing that happened to democrats when Obama was president.   Republicans will more than likely get crushed in 2026. 2028 will completely depend on the economy and who each party nominates, but there won’t be a Trump on the ballot to activate the millions of people who care about one person and one person only: him",2057Champs__,2025-04-02T03:15:35,190
"I think people rely too much on the idea of historical trends. The Assumption that everything is vaguely always the same and never changes that isn't accurate. Between 1865 and 1965 the U.S. experienced the Civil War, Spanish American War, WW1, WW2, and the Korean War. Millions died. Additionally that period experienced Reconstruction, the Great Depression, Mexican repatriation, Segregation, and the inclusion of 14 new States.   In the 65yrs since then we haven't experienced anything like that stuff.",8to24,2025-04-02T06:53:24,58
"It should be an early warning sign, but on the other hand it does not mean Democrats can coast to victory   Right now the Democrats have a more motivated base because the Administration is busy slamming their dick in a car door on a daily basis.   By Nov 2026 most of the headlines won't be about layoffs of federal workers, because most of those headlines will be done by June of this year. They won't be about huge pending cuts to Medicaid, because that will have already failed in Congress or will have *passed*, and people will have had a year to become accustomed to the new normal. Even some people who are directly negatively impacted in the latter case will still pull the level for the Republican candidate because they dislike ""Woke"" more than their loss of insurance    Certainly, candidates in 2026 should and will be talking about the chaos of the moment, but they're going to need to offer more than ""we fucking told you so"". The ""something else"" will depend on the candidate and the district - a message that sells in a D+30 district isn't going anywhere in an R+2",Objective_Aside1858,2025-04-02T06:53:51,32
"So a couple of thoughts:  1) These results should be flashing red lights for Republicans. Special elections show who's motivated and who's not motivated to vote and right now it's Dems who are motivated. The Republican margins in both FL special elections are another big indicator of that.   2) Another red flag is that for 2016,  2020 and 2024, Republicans have had Trump on the ballot and like it or not, he has a ballot magic that makes people turn out to vote. Now Trump isn't on the ballot, that magic is gone. Look at what happened in 2018, 2022, and now 2025.   3) That being said, Democrats cannot coast. Maybe this is a fluke? But my thing is, Dems should keep hammering folks on key issues like Elon, abortion rights, and potentially healthcare.",Zwicker101,2025-04-02T07:22:39,29
"This happens all the time, usually the party out of power over performs in low voter turnout elections including the midterms. In the past, Republicans have the edge on voter turnout, but since the Republican and Democrat coalitions have shifted in the past few years, now Democrats have the lead when turnout is low.     Basically, the Democrats will kill it in any special or lower turnout election, they have their coalition and out of power boost",northernlake926,2025-04-02T07:05:07,7
"Midterm elections tend to go against the party of the president because unhappy opponents of the president are more likely to vote.  Overall turnout rates of midterms are also lower than they are during presidential election cycles, as voters are most interested in the presidency.  Special elections can be even more skewed due to very low rates of turnout compared to the norm.  As an example of this, compare the total number of votes in Wisconsin for president in 2024 (about 3.4 million), then compare it to the total number of votes in yesterday's state supreme court race (still being counted, but will probably end up at around 2.4 million).  The latter is notably lower than the former.",I405CA,2025-04-02T09:18:35,6
"I remember John Boehner giving a speech, as Speaker of the House, the evening before the ACA (Obamacare) vote was passed. He talked about how politics often acts like a pendulum, when pushed too far in one direction, it inevitably swings back just as far in the opposite direction.   I don't think it can be rationally denied that Donald Trump, elected Republicans, and MAGA voters have pushed that pendulum very damn far to the right. Logic and the karmic nature of reality suggests an equal and opposite reaction is inevitable. Is this the start of that? Maybe. Whether it is or not, that reaction is coming and it is going to be intense.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-02T06:20:40,17

">all four counties shifted left by a sizeable margin even from just a few months ago in November.  That's not surprising to me at all. Special elections have lower turnout than presidential elections. Trump tends to do well with voters who don't vote very often, while Democrats tend to do well with highly educated, highly engaged voters who vote even in non-presidential elections. Plus, Trump is sui generis and he wasn't on the ballot in the special election.   I think it is also likely that Republicans won't do well in the 2026 midterms, but that's normal: whichever party has the White House tends not to do well in the midterms. So that's not necessarily related to the Wisconsin special election.",dear-mycologistical,2025-04-02T12:49:25,3
"When 538 was around, they put together some good summaries of special elections and relative shift from partissan lean. In the absence of this, rough estimate is that it's going pretty well, maybe [similar to 201](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/)7 (although one would have to crunch the numbers), in which they won the national House vote by over 8%, highest in decades, even while districts were still heavily gerrymandered in favor of Republicans from their 2010 redistricting efforts. The WI supreme court election is more indicative in that it more closely resembles a midterm environment and arguably closer to a presidential election environment, with massive money spent on each side, with Musk even giving money to individual voters in a possible illegal move, Republican party leaders going all in, and candidates leaving no doubt about where they stand ideologically. That Crawford still won by 10% in a high turnout special election environment is significant.",gmb92,2025-04-02T13:19:40,3
I think a better measure of the midterms is in congressional races.    And yesterday's results from Florida suggest that all of Trump's craziness is not costing the Republicans any power in Congress.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-02T09:47:20,2
"Great observations! I agree that special election dynamics often differ significantly from general elections, particularly regarding turnout patterns. Historically, Democrats have indeed shown stronger performance in special elections due to mobilization efforts, but consistent shifts across multiple counties or states—like the examples you've pointed out—can sometimes indicate broader electoral trends. It'll definitely be interesting to monitor if this momentum holds up as we approach the midterms. Thanks for highlighting these data points; always fascinating to watch these early signals unfold!",AbsoluteReason,2025-04-02T12:29:22,2

"The party of the incumbent president tends to lose ground during midterm elections: since World War II, the president's party has lost an average of 26 seats in the House, and an average of four seats in the Senate. Couple this with the fact the POTUS has been letting a ketamine addict make wide sweeping changes to government, the killing of middle class jobs with these mass firings of federal workers, the on-again, off-again tariffs that are going to raise prices for every raw material, the cancelation of billions in federal grants, a drunkard is texting literal warplans to journalists, the ridiculous unprovoked harassment of our closest allies.

"My simple observation is this. Americans have no intestinal fortitude for the long process ( things that take time to effectively change for improved outcomes or not) any longer. The majority of our neighbors through technology, self entitlement and lack of self discipline and self awareness have become conditioned back to the adolescent mindset of “ give it to me now” or “ I can wait until things get better”! Or the simple, “ it’s not fair”!  Thus any immediate hardship encountered ( not just politically) but in one’s life in general is approached denial, great aversion, fear and hostility.  It is not an accusation of how entitled ( or spoiled) we have become as a Nation. It is just one man’s observation as he has travelled his life around this Earth, spoken to many peoples and listened with open mind to their stories and opinions of our citizens and myself.

It’s a normal trend for voters who are angry to turn up to vote more than for the voters who are happy or neutral. So it makes sense that democrats are in the polls more now for midterms.,BNTMS233,2025-04-02T18:33:53,1
"All three elections last night are a gigantic, screaming, five-alarm fire for Republicans.  \-The turnout advantage for Dems in WI was reduced by the investment of money and attention that was poured into the race by Musk and the GOP.  The Dems still managed to swing it more than 11 points left from November.  The Florida elections didn't show *as* insanely high turnout (although still high!), and the leftward swings were 15 and 20 points instead.  \-This happened when Trump is nearly the MOST popular he has ever been, and during his honeymoon.  These are TWO very compelling reasons just based on historical precedent that he will likely be less popular (possibly much less popular) by this November's big-ticket races.  \-Conversely, these also happened when Dems are the LEAST popular THEY have ever been.  Reversion to the mean suggests they will likely be more popular in November.  The ray of light for the GOP here is that record unpopularity is driven by a very dissatisfied Dem base, and as last night proved quite ably, that unrest is not making them run out and embrace the GOP right now.  Therefore, you wouldn't necessarily see big gains if the Dems get base voter confidence back (although if they *don't*, it could mean they *lose* some of their current edge).  \-Economists are not mincing words about the tariffs.  The economy is in decent shape right now, but likely will not be in November.  And with a GOP trifecta in Washington, the GOP will not be able to persuade many voters who weren't already locked in for them that the crash was Biden's/Dem's faults.  Keep in mind that Trump won in November on the back of inflation (i.e. the economy) alone.  These swing voters have already proven they will turn on you if they think you hurt their wallets!  Suffice it to say that pulling Stefanik's nom is one of the smartest political moves Trump has ever made.

The presidential election is still so far out that it's hardly worth talking about until summer 2027. For the Dems the big win would be taking the House and winning the competitive senate seats including Maine and North Carolina. If they can do that then they put themselves in a position where they could win the trifecta in 2028.   The other big thing to keep in mind is that Trump is ""relatively"" popular right now and the economy is ""relatively"" good. For most of Trump's first term his approval was a few points lower than it is today and if we see a return to those figures it could spell trouble for him. Also if the economy stagnates or gets worse it could also spell trouble.",socialistrob,2025-04-02T13:53:58,5

"How a majority can ""back him""? Passing a law that says the 22nd Amd doesn't apply to Trump? All courts, yes including SCOTUS, will shoot it down. OK, then what?   The bureaucrats, lawyers, and clerks who run elections are actually State and county level, not federal. Trump *could* make death threats and incite angry mobs their way, or even call Governors and ask them to fire them. The firings are overturned by courts. Ultimately whether or not the machinery of govt and  elections functions sanely depends on whether these people can physically enter their places of work and do their jobs. 2020-2021 was a genuinely dangerous test of that, but only a small % of officials and activists had drunk so much Kool-aid they tried to defy basic legal reality. Of that group, the worst chunk was an angry mob that culminated in Jan 6. There was no cabal of judges, Congresspeople, and military/security forces who could be convinced to follow Trump in a proper coup attempt. Most people who DID follow him got fines and jailtime for it all, including at the State level for election obstruction. Had the Biden admin been less timid, Trump would've gone to jail and the rioters would still be there.      Trump ultimately cares more about staying out of jail than doing the job of President. He may argue for a loophole between Amds 12+22, and he may succeed! But if that fails, his best bet is to get Vance elected legitimately and convince Vance to pardon him. Banging his head against a brick wall and declaring ""I am the President, now and henceforth!"" will only help get a Democrat elected and make it easier to rack up new charges against him.",ClarkMyWords,2025-04-02T12:07:57,6

"I don't think it would even be a puppet Presidency. I think their inaugural and farewell addresses would be one and the same. The loophole being discussed leaves Trump eligible for the office of President, but not ELECTION TO that office. It would require death, resignation (the obvious plan), or even impeachment/conviction of the sitting President. Then Vice President Trump takes over.   I say this not in any political support of Trump, but in detaching my emotions and wrangling the legal technicalities for what they are, not what I would like them to be. My personal take on Trump is that if he finds he can legally be elected VP, he won't be content to sit back and guide a protege on running the country. That IS what Putin did as Prime Minister ""under"" Medvedev. The PM in Russia is already more powerful than our VP, and Putin still got mad at Medvedev at times when the two disagreed. Trump would expect a near-immediate resignation. Again, if SCOTUS rules that Trump can run for VP (and the technicality, absurd as it is, makes sense) then the 22nd A sure doesn't override the 25th.   While the 25th seems redundant, there was once some ambiguity in the original legalese from 1787 as to whether a VP becomes President or ""merely"" acting-President. Starting with John Tyler, we got used to a tradition of assuming he was full-on President. Then the JFK assassination prompted speculation on what the hell we'd do as a country a President survived a crisis but with major brain or bodily damage, in a coma, etc. Amidst the risk of nuclear war, Congress + States passed the 25th to settle both issues.",ClarkMyWords,2025-04-02T10:54:14,5

Trump has a cult of personality and can get at least the party to go along with such a charade even if they don't like it. Obama would have to be pickier if he chooses to run for ""Vice"" President.

"Let me start by emphasizing I despise Trump and the GOP, and believe that Presidents should not be able to serve more than two terms.  You aren’t understanding him.  This will be a battle of \*exact words\*.  Trump is not eligible to be ELECTED President again.  But the VP just has to be someone who can BE President.  These are heavily overlapping groups, but they are not the precise same, based on a purely literal interpretation of the relevant Amendments.  Now, that doesn’t mean it’s a done deal for Trump.  If there is evidence that the authors of the 22nd Amendment meant for it to preclude a two-term President from ever being President again, then an objective and unbiased Supreme Court would interpret the 22nd to bar Trumps gambit.  When you consider that there are 3 liberals, Gorsuch who is a very sincere originalist unafraid to buck conservative orthodoxy in some cases to be so, Roberts who still cares about the APPEARANCE of legitimacy, and Barrett who has been a bit of a wild card, I think there’s a reasonable chance that’s exactly that would happen.  If, in fact, that evidence is brought to light.  If there is no such evidence?  Then it’s one of the most contentious court cases in the history of the country.  I suspect that the 22nd WAS meant to bar Presidents from serving more than two terms in ANY way, because that’s just common sense - there’s no reason why you’d keep them just from running for the office after two wins.  In fact, if we are talking about an indefinitely long leadership, it is critical for it to be as democratically determined as possible.  But I doubt anyone will be able to prove it beyond a doubt, and the argument to “let the people decide” is difficult to beat without a really strong case.  So I’m really hoping this is not a question that gets answered in the near future.",InCarbsWeTrust,2025-04-02T18:19:08,3

Until then, we're all just spitballing dystopian scenarios about which we can't prove one way or another.",NoExcuses1984,2025-04-02T19:36:23,1

You're speaking too logically for the man who still thinks the tariffs he's placing are paid by other countries.,derbyt,2025-04-02T14:50:50,8
"Yes, burden of evidence. The evidence you provide doesn’t affect the 22nd A and how it is executed.  I’m one of the career people who was fired and I have been vocally critical of tariffs. I’m not defending his job performance and absolutely think guardrails around a LOT of norms and laws are broken. But let’s game this out.   If Trump files to run for President in 2028, literally anywhere he files will face blockage. Most officials would deny the filing outright. A few may be cowards, or even sycophants, and accept it so as to pass the buck. So some civil group files a lawsuit, and whatever court has jurisdiction there will promptly rule against him. Yes, even the conservative ones. Look at how they’ve treated his EO against the 14th-A.   Now every State and county official has an explicit ruling to do what was already obvious: continue denying Trump 2028 filings. So what Trump can do now.  Appeal? Denied. Appeal to SCOTUS? Denied again 9-0 like his claims of fraud were in 2020.   Tweet death threats, or dox the county clerks? Order them arrested? Order whom? FBI and military officers would refuse. Complain to Governors? I doubt any would face the political and legal risks *to themselves* by helping him do something so obviously illegal, that would be so obviously overturned, again, and that Trump cannot offer pardons for.  So, how do YOU game out Trump getting past the 22nd Amendment, specifically the human beings who enforce it?   Anything he tries after getting ruled against just makes it likelier a) a Democrat wins in 2028 b) he goes to prison after.",ClarkMyWords,2025-04-02T16:42:36,1
"When I was in the State Dept I brought up something with my boss about a recent court ruling. I was hopeful it meant we’d see a change in policy. He pointed out that nothing was certain, and to not make assumptions based on the news; we had to sit and continue doing our jobs until we received further guidance from higher up. Everything else in my experience there shows other bureaucrats, diplomats, analysts, etc think the same way. The mindset is “I’m just gonna stay in my job, do it well, and not worry about politics that I can’t control.” Like, I certainly get the sentiment when you are confident a President and their Cabinet will accept judicial review.  And it makes sense if you work in DHS tracking cartels, and you think something like DEI is overblown as a culture war in how much impact it actually has on daily lives. But what about when you get directions to follow that seem really heavy-handed, even cruel, against people who clearly aren’t cartel members?  You see it’s being challenged in court, but some Deputy Assistant Secretary assures you at a monthly meeting to keep following policy and wait for more guidance. Then a court rules against it. You bring it up with your boss a day or two later and he says “Sorry, I understand, but we haven’t heard anything yet.”   You try and bring it up with the DAS at the next monthly meeting. He says “A lot of stuff is in motion, we have no further guidance at this time. Just keep focused on the great job you are doing, because you all are part of such a vital mission…” blah blah, the usual DC pep talk. You’re not a lawyer but it sure sounds like this Admin is pretending a court ruling just doesn’t exist. And you’ve spent a month having to tag some people as more suspicious or less (for potential searches and seizures) based on whether they spoke Spanish or English and reviewing the Spanish-speakers’ social media for “anti-American sentiment” as a sign of… drug activity. Hypothetical, but plausible.  Like, at what point do federal workers recognize this admin is ignoring courts and pulling the wool over their eyes? How much of it builds before govt functionaries say “No, that’s illegal, I know about this stuff being overturned from multiple reputable sources, and ‘we’re just following orders’ isn’t a good reason for continuing this $h!t” ??  It’s been a few weeks since most of these layoffs were overturned and I still have no “guidance” about going back to work.",ClarkMyWords,2025-04-02T20:48:58,1

"Sorry. Not accepting this because we still haven’t seen how anyone will react to Trump saying “oops! Couldn’t turn that plane around. That gay barber is fucked. Nothing we could do. We ain’t listening. La La La - can’t hear you”   The first guardrail is gone. None of the republicans are giving a shit.   I’m naturally a pessimist. I’ve seen nothing yet that gives me hope.   BTW - I’m not rooting for this to happen. To repeat the last line - nothing is giving me hope that things will stop before it’s too late.   Soldiers refusing to carry out an illegal order - what does that mean anymore with the career military gone?  Edit   Adding the entire transparent Eric Adam’s bullshit and the inevitable, no good choice “we got to shoot the hostage rather than let them blackmail us - I mean drop all the fucking charges!!” Geez another cop walks free.",checker280,2025-04-02T19:57:33,2
"You're not answering my question of \*how\* this plays out, you're citing other bad things Trump has done. It's not about if Congressional Republicans will vote to impeach him. They won't. Democrats probably would if he files to run for a third term.      I get that a lot of people, including military, aren't sure about the legal specifics of what's going on around them and just have to act on the best info they're given, especially with the threat of serious punishment for insubordination. But I guarantee you every county/State election clerk knows what the hell the two-term limit is. The ""Trump 2028 campaign"" has to go through them to get on the ballot. So the clerks reject it and never let it reach their Secretary of State's desk. \*And Trump can't fire them.\*  Maybe he complains, even calls up the Secretaries of State and tells them to fire/threaten these bureaucrats. Now IF a bunch of States had delusional cultists like Kari Lake in charge... you'd be onto something. But they don't, so you're not. You cite prior, separate actions by Trump that went unchecked because he had political and/or legal power over these people.       So you want to look at past examples of his guardrail-ripping? In 2020 he tried pressuring just one Republican StateSec - it went absolutely nowhere, and Trump would've gone to prison if Merrick Garland didn't dawdle for 2+ years. The Congressman he endorsed in the 2022 primary also ran on Trump's lies about voter fraud, and Raffensberger swept him aside by 20 points. So you tell me, what can Trump do about that using people he actually has power over?       His only viable path is to run for VP based on inconsistent language between the 12th and 22nd Amds, and hope it holds up in Court. So if he does THAT in a few years, don't grumble about me saying it couldn't happen. If anything I'm saying it might because a plan to just pretending the 22nd doesn't even exist and is absurd by comparison.",ClarkMyWords,2025-04-02T22:47:47,1
"How does it play out? The sane way the tariffs just happened.   Trump says they are doing it. Does it. And nobody responds.   He just made an executive order about voting the other day. Has anyone responded yet?  Edit:  Here’s the link. The Dems are suing. We better hope we get a reasonable judge.   Has anyone Republican responded? What happened to State’s Rights? For or against? Is Fox News covering this? No?  Are the abstainers paying attention? We are in the minority.   https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/01/trump-election-executive-order-democrats-lawsuit/82755125007/  We should be hearing from a judge about the Federal government disobeying the Judge’s order to turn around two planes today.   Will his response have teeth? Will anyone see any punishment or will they just get a furrowed brow and a stern scolding?  The pilots of those two planes - has their consciences got them to come forward yet? Sure, sure - lots of lip service that no cop or soldier would follow a bad order but I see no evidence that they won’t. A lot of cops voted for him despite all the shit he says about them.  “Thursday’s hearing could present the most consequential face-off yet between the executive and judicial branches of government since Trump took office in January, as Trump attempts to unilaterally implement parts of his agenda amid a flood of litigation.”  https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/judge-hear-arguments-trump-deportation-flights-defied-court/story?id=120446845",checker280,2025-04-03T11:36:17,2
