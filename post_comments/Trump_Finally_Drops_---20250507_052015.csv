Obviously this isn't about Trump's crusade against anything antisemitic. This is a crusade against DEI .,RiseDelicious3556,2025-05-07T05:57:18,1
"Not that it matters because itâ€™s all bad, but itâ€™s hard to tell how much of this is him, and how much of this is him being a channel for the Russell Voughts (Project 2025) of the world. I always knew Trump was a racist, sexist, anti-immigrant (well, with the exception of his wives anyways) back in his NYC days but ever since his second term itâ€™s become clear these hate groups have really taken over.   What we saw the first time around in Virginia with the antisemitism that got that young woman killed was not a one off. And so when I think about thatâ€¦I have a hard time believing any of this crusade is about antisemitism. Because if that was true this wouldâ€™ve started the second after we saw that march on tv. That was a disgrace and for Trump to say â€˜there were bad people on both sidesâ€™ just cinches it.   Same goes for the trans-girls-in-sports thing. I remember back when the same Trump people YEARS ago used to say that playing sports turned girls into lesbians. So which is it!? Do you need to cancel girls sports to prevent us from â€˜turning into lesbiansâ€™ or do you need to protect us from men having sex changes just to see us taking showers? I mean - when you see it written out itâ€™s absolutely ridiculous.   Long story short - just keep this administration away from us.",jl56649,2025-05-07T06:17:15,1

"I never thought he really cared about antisemitism, itâ€™s just a stick to beat people he doesnâ€™t like - Muslims and brown people.",macandcheesefan45,2025-05-07T05:53:17,1
"Maybe Linda McMahon should stick with theatrical wrestling.  Someone leading US Education who has no idea what AI is (or ""A-one"" as she calls it), is clearly out of her depth.  As far as anti-semitism, we all knew from Super-Karen Stefanik's TV-show McCarthy hearings, that the objective was to wrest control of top US schools, not to address actual anti-semitism.  If the Trump administration cared ONE WIT about anti-semitism, it wouldn't have a Seig Heil Saluting coPresident, who has to be admonished by the ADL to stop making holocaust jokes.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-07T06:34:19,1

Trump's an antisemite but doesn't get called on it because the corporate media thinks support for Israel is the only test of antisemitism,RobutNotRobot,2025-05-07T12:43:29,1
"Look at New York. The Israeli sourced people are off the chain. If youâ€™re that pro any country other than ours, the United States, go there and fight. Embarrassing",Itchy-Radio-1059,2025-05-07T07:02:24,1
"And it goes broader than that. It's liberal ideas in general.   And it's part of Trump's larger power grab to exert control over as much as he possibly can.  Like Dr. Seuss's Yurtle the Turtle, it angers him to see anything he doesn't control.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-07T06:07:56,1
"Yeah, crazy that if there was no DEI, there would be no Trump.   If Biden only ran the economy instead of trying to manipulate society by incorporating corruption in Departmental policy while simultaneously destroying the principle of bipartisan departments, then Kamala would have been elected.   Before that, if the Democrats didnâ€™t sabotage Bernieâ€™s election campaign, then they never would have proven Trump correct in saying that there was a swamp in Washington and Trump never would have gotten elected the first time.  And thatâ€™s how corruption breeds corruption.",PlanetCosmoX,2025-05-07T08:21:23,1
"Actually more enraging he said there were ""very fine people on both sides""  The 30,000ft view: He finds it politically advantageous to DIVIDE US",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-07T06:27:03,1
"This could be total bullshit, but I think there is a feedback loop at play here. Trump has always been the things that you have called out, no question, but I don't think he cared all that much until he discovered that adherents to his political movement love it when he feeds into their bigoty and rally around it. The more excited they are about him, the more excited he is to feed into what drives their adoration.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-07T07:06:18,1

Yup.  Just like his old days as the King of Queens.  He is also targeting universities and educational institutions - how else could he control youth and snuff out 'liberal arts education'?  Red meat for the base.    He loves the poorly educated.  Where would he be without them?,XSinTrick6666,2025-05-07T06:22:10,1

">Before that, if the Democrats didnâ€™t sabotage Bernieâ€™s election campaign, then they never would have proven Trump correct in saying that there was a swamp in Washington and Trump never would have gotten elected the first time.   TIL that when Trump said he was going to drain the swamp he meant he was going to make the Democratic party's process for selecting their Presidential nominee fairer.",bin10pac,2025-05-07T09:34:41,1
