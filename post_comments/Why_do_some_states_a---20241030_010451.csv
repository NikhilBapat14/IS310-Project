"You aren't required to have ID at the polling station. Per federal law, you are required to present either a drivers license or social sercurity number proving citizenship when you first register to vote.    Your polling place has a list of all the names of everyone that is registered to vote at that location, which they mark when that person arrives. So *theoretically* a person who is not registered to vote could show up to a polling place in one of those locations *if* they know the name of someone who is registered at the same location, though they risk that person having already voted, which then starts an investigation. Pretty large risk of jail time for something likely to go wrong",bmilohill,2024-10-30T10:41:11,12
Non-citizens can’t vote. It’s not like you show up and get a ballot. When you register to vote your state’s Board of Elections double checks everything to ensure you are a US citizen over 18 etc. Furthermore every year they do an audit to see who died so you don’t have dead people voting. In NY They also check if you’re in prison for a felony and also check if a court has judge you to be mentally incompetent. This stuff is done in the background as that it’s easier in the voters to vote.,theconcreteclub,2024-10-30T10:35:38,10
"Non-citizens aren't allowed to vote, period.  If you don't have an ID, you wouldn't be able to register to vote. In most precincts, you still need an ID to vote. In every precinct, you need to be registered.  There is a thing called a 'provisional ballot', which is where a lot of misinformation and confusion originates. This is a ballot for if there is some disagreement about your registration status (say you registered but for some reason you aren't on their list, or you're voting in the wrong precinct due to an address change or something). Anyone can fill out a provisional ballot. However, provisional ballots will only be counted if they are fully vetted: there is a high threshold of certainty that needs to be met to validate the authenticity and legality of said ballot before it gets counted.  If someone is intentially abusing provisional ballots, in even a futile effort to skew election results, they would likely face criminal charges.",cossiander,2024-10-30T11:33:57,3
"On top of other answers already posited, the reason it doesn't get fixed is because it's a political football.   The obvious solution would be to issue every citizen a voter ID, but in order to make this fair it has to be issued to everyone for free. As a country it was long ago decided that any fee required to allow you to vote was illegal\*, as this was a tool used to disenfranchise poor(mostly formerly enslaved) people. A voter ID is a popular idea, but it runs into  opposition for a few reasons:  1. There are, contrary to popular belief, no federal elections in the US for ordinary people. Elections are all held by individual states. When it comes to voting for president, it's just an election to tell your state representatives how to cast ballots in the federal election they participate in.      2. States generally create ballots exclusively by address. What I mean by this is, your voting is done by where you live. If you move to a new address in the same state, and you don't change your address on your voter registration, you won't be allowed to vote at your new home.\*\* There's a patchwork of laws on how to address this, including for people who are currently living outside the country and military.  3. And most importantly not having a simple solution (eg, issue everyone ballots for all races their eligible to vote in(eg, statewide races) leaves a problem you can continually point to. There's more political benefit to NOT letting people vote if you hold positions that would not survive a popular vote in a fair election.   \*That said, there are still ways to make poll taxes exist-for example, the restoration of voting rights in place like Florida for former felons requires paying a fine. It's legally dubious, but hasn't got enough support to challenge it.  \*\*Most states offer some degree of provisional ballots, with varying levels of acceptance criteria. Some never get counted unless it's a close race, or some other circumstance exists,  some allow votes to be tallied separately for local vs statewide elections. There's really no uniformity to voting in the US.",scubafork,2024-10-30T12:22:29,2
"Another reason I haven’t seen yet: history. In our country there used to be laws, mostly in the south, meant to curtail the minority’s votes. They did poll taxes, poll quizzes and held people at work to prevent them from voting. Truly some of the most evil sh!t.  So there is still a deep scar in this country that makes it so we don’t do a single thing more than the bare minimum to prevent people from voting. Anything else can and will be abused.  A modern day example: early voting drop boxes being set ablaze.",31engine,2024-10-30T12:58:10,1
So the whole thing about not needing an ID to vote is a spin from the republicans to say that voting system is illegitimate?,Flatzic,2024-11-05T01:57:47,1
"Its so that the illegals could get their votes in for Kamala, however even that wasn't good enough.",AlvinYakito,2024-11-08T13:01:48,1
That's not true in every state,Important_Present302,2025-04-04T18:07:14,1
"Who told you that lie? Before our state had voter ID, which had only been a few years, a person could walk in on election day and just bring in a utility bill, register to vote, and vote.  Literally anyone, even illegals with a utility bill, could vote. States hardly check on voters. There is no way they could tell if they are a citizen, only a resident. What makes you think they check anything? States can't even clean the voter rolls without a law suite and they keep claiming they don't have the manpower. What makes you think they can do all you claim",Important_Present302,2025-04-04T17:48:27,1

"Yes, because you technically do need an ID in every state to vote. But in states like California you only need to show your ID  (such as an ID Card, driver’s license, birth certificate or passport) if you’re a first time voter. Afterwards, you’re automatically registered. You save yourself a lot of time, trouble and money that way. Especially if you’re someone of low income, who probably doesn’t have the time and wealth to take care of all that bureaucratic stuff along work.",Imaginary-Durian5953,2024-11-11T05:11:52,1
"No. Not every state has the same requirements. In my state before voter id, all you needed to register to vote was a utility bill showing you lived in the distric you were voting in. No idea was required.",Important_Present302,2025-04-04T18:13:05,1
No. Not all state require id's to register. Some only require you live in the state. Proof can be as little as a utility bill with your name and address on it.,Important_Present302,2025-04-04T18:16:27,1
