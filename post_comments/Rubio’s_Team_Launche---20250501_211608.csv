It's darkly comedic how Alex Jones used to be thought of as a fringe lunatic but now He's just a regular republican.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-01T21:16:58,225

"Headline undersells:  >In particular, Beattie wanted records held by the agency’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub, which replaced the now-defunct GEC that exposed Russian propaganda and Chinese disinformation operations.  >The State Department also sought documents and correspondence that mentioned: Trump, Elon Musk, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as keywords like Black Lives Matter, January 6, Q-Anon, immigration, and anti-vaxx.  May as well just search for their own names too",nerphurp,2025-05-01T21:44:38,40
">Beattie, a conservative journalist who was fired as speechwriter during the first Trump administration for appearing with white nationalists, reportedly told State Department officials that he aimed to release internal agency documents “to rebuild trust with the American public.”  But in Trump 2.0 appearing with White Nationalists is a badge of honor?",dremonearm,2025-05-01T21:38:29,16

They all have to serve Trump's interests or they will be given the chop. Don't expect a single one of them to do anything that will actually help the American people. Rubio is more dangerous because he is more capable than the rest.,dbzelectricslash331,2025-05-02T05:04:06,3
