"Having seen the pic of Cheeto Hitler looking old and sick and fast asleep at the late Pope's funeral, I am really wondering how much longer he's going to last.  The Trump Slump will collapse the US economy, and he will attempt to steal the 2026 election.  The result will be a backlash that will have... consequences.  On this day in 1945, another Authoritarian Leader ended his reign abruptly.  VA's official state motto was apposite then and it's apposite now.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-30T19:41:33,10

"rid media, one that is state media but shifting across The second Trump Administration's treatment of friendly media is one of those slow-moving Rubicon moments in American politics. This will not go away. We'll see it employed across Republican and Democrat administrations.
