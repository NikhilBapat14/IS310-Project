"Americans need to keep repeating this.  The ""Freedoms"" described in the Constitution must be for EVERYBODY, or else they are for NOBODY.  Fighting for your neighbor's rights is fighting for YOUR rights.  Real American Patriots fight for Democracy and a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.",Awesome_Bob,2025-04-08T15:06:32,16
Governor Walz is spitting NOTHING but TRUTH here! NOTHING but TRUTH! And I'm willing to fight for our country to remain based on the principles of FREEDOM--- NOT privilege!,Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-04-08T14:38:14,12

"I love Tim Walz and he speaks nothing but the truth, the sad part is the Trump regime doesn't care about truth or laws or common sense, we've all seen they just break rules regardless. They've caused so much damage in a record amount of time it's already to late.  Either the bipartisan congress and the supposedly blind SCOTUS actually follows the laws or we are doomed to a sad existence and a painful recovery. All so unnecessary, I voted Harris/Walz, just think of where we could be now.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-08T15:17:58,14
Don't listen to him. Elon says he's a creep for not being sad that Elon is sad. He's hurting Elon's feelings. Won't anyone stand up for the poor billionaires?   /s,meowsaysdexter,2025-04-08T19:26:06,6

"Then the government probably should've done a better job at convincing the average person that freedom can be obtained by all without sacrificing the prosperity of the individual.  Notice how the greatest progressive achievements such as the civil rights, happened during periods of prosperity and growth?  If the DNC is unable to address the reality of what drives people to this ""privileged"" ideology, they are going to lose 2028, or 2032, whichever, and we'll be back here, at step one, wondering how, when the answer is really simple. The people who didn't vote, or who voted Trump, believe to some extent that freedom for everyone means marginal improvements to their individual prosperity, and freedom for the select few (see: America First ideas) means significant improvements to their individual prosperity.  DNC needs to figure out how to convince people that it's possible to significantly improve lives of *everyone*, but so far they've only offered small improvements that don't effect the majority.  Yea the DNC could only make small improvements because they get interference from the GOP, but that only means they can't effectively fight the other side.",Naticbee,2025-04-08T14:58:15,1
