"Who in absolute preposterous fuck even cares.   This pants-shitting moron is just pointing to random features and declaring they're named something else.  Republicans, this is your alpha? This old-ass makeup-caked deranged fool staring at a globe and just declaring random geographical features have new names?  This is the most weak-ass saddest fucking thing I've ever seen. Are you people serious? This ass clown? Really?  **EDIT**: Comment from a Republican asking how weak Trump could be if he beat the Democrat ""alpha"" in an election.   First, no one on the left calls our political leaders that because we didn't stop emotionally maturing in the eighth grade, you fucking weirdos.  Second, the only reason Donald Trump wins is because you vote for him. And only you people can answer why you are incapable of seeing what a bad fucking choice that is.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T20:22:44,223

"This is not new. Soon after Jihadist Arab invasions, they tried to destroy local languages and laws, forcing Arabic on people from Egypt to Iraq. Persians resisted which is why Arabic stops at borders of Iran and everyone east of Iran retained their language. So unlike what people think here, it matters a great deal to Persians. And Trump is knowing or not, putting a stamp of approval on the same sort of terror that inflicted US in 911. A globalist Arabist Jihad, it just happened first to Persians 1400 years ago. The majority of Iranian Americans contributed to his campaign and voted for him because they thought he would help with democracy in Iran. I am sure they are now enraged and feel like fools.

Not at any other human endeavor but most especially any endeavor requirint intellectual thought, creativity, and keeping a cool head in crises. You don't put the person best at murder at the head of the army. You put the cleverest. The ones able to manage the logistics of an army on the march, able to strategize at scale and do the mental work requisite to achieve goals.  Violent ones are the ones that don't have the mental capacity to exist in any other way except the most savage and least-intellectually demanding of existences and in nearly every possible case they are the worst choice for a leader.  I don't want a POTUS who photoshops himself on a muscular body he can never attain in real life holding a light saber from a movie he never watched. That's a mentally deranged individual. If you do that while occupying an office whose decisions affect the lives and livelihoods of billions of people on this planet then you fundamentally don't posess the maturity to serve in a job that significant.  Donald Trump is emotionally a toddler. I don't mean that as an insult. I mean that he is deeply mentally damaged and displays the emotional and intellectual capacities of a young child. That's a really, really bad thing. He needs a constantly, endless supply of validation to feel even the remote sense of fleeting happiness, because his dad endlessly physically and verbally abused him as a child and raised him to be a pathological narcissist endlessly seeking attention and validation and never knowing a moment of love or contentment in his miserable crime-filled life.  And I had the naive hope that I lived in a country where that would have been obvious to enough of the voting public, too.   Because it is obvious. If you can't see that it's obvious, then you need to ask yourself how loose your grip on reality really is.  POTUS is a bureaucrat elected to fulfill a routine administrative function. Which, yes, unfortunately requires a reading comprehension beyond the sixth grade level to grasp it should be a level-headed, experienced legislature who is familiar with the federal bureuacracy, and not a reality TV show host with profound mental health issues and a lifetime of evidence of poor decision-making, bankrupted businesses, emotional impetuousness, and innumerable other failings each of which individually would disqualify him from holding office in a serious country with a far better literacy rate.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T20:43:30,59

"This isn't about the Democrats. It's about Trump being a joke.  What Trump's election says, though, is that we're collectively a bunch of morons that value authenticity (including authentically crazy) over competence. Pausing to consider a response is seen as a weakness, whereas spouting whatever nonsense enters your brain in the moment is seen as strength. It doesn't matter that the former makes for a MUCH better president than the latter, the American people know what they want.   I listened to an interview recently where a question included the fact that politician had been involved in politics as a child and she responded ""you just broke the first rule of politics - pretend that you just woke up one day and decided to run."" That joke says so much about how stupid voters are, and how aware of it politicians are.",BlooregardQKazoo,2025-05-06T21:17:59,2

"Portions of the US Military (for instance, the US 5th Fleet) have been calling it the Arabian Gulf since 1991.  Which, of course, well precedes Trump being President.  We're on much friendlier terms with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar and Oman (among others) than we are Iran.
