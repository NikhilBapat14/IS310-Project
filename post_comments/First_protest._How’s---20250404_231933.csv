You spelled everything right. Definitely not a republican.,oscar-the-bud,2025-04-05T05:19:30,3
Good sign. Not sure it's true. But good sign nonetheless.,MysteriousScratch478,2025-04-05T01:21:22,4
"I like it. Makes me want to nod in agreement, and it‚Äôs nice and readable from a distance. I have not seen many green signs so it will stick out, too.",LegitimateBeing2,2025-04-05T01:36:09,2

This is why democrats are losing. You need confirmation from other random people on the internet about your softly worded sign before doing the lowest level of resistance possible in response to being absolutely stomped on. We need to take meaningful action and be confident in ourselves in doing so.,Quiet-Competition849,2025-04-08T00:20:10,0

The USA is better than Trump and Musk. It‚Äôs time we kick them to the curb,newshirtworthy,2025-04-05T11:07:29,0
If we get a solid majority we could finally pass disinformation and propaganda laws. We could make news standards/laws for cable news and take the teeth outta Fox.   There is always a chance until we‚Äôre dead.,MightyFrex,2025-04-05T07:56:01,2
I feel this. I‚Äôm hoping the sign sparks conversation. I like to believe that we are better than Trump and Musk,newshirtworthy,2025-04-05T11:08:52,0
I‚Äôm making meaningful action. What else do you expect me to do? Me making a sign and going to my first protest is ‚Äúthe reason democrats are losing‚Äù?  Why not share some examples of how else I‚Äôm expected to save the democratic party?,newshirtworthy,2025-04-08T02:18:52,1
I do believe ‚ÄúMost‚Äù of us are better than this.,Key-Time-7411,2025-04-05T07:58:14,1
70%+ wanted this or consented to it via inaction.   By my 51% rule. No we are not.,SandiegoJack,2025-04-05T09:02:58,1
