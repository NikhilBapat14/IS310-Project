"As resident Canadian, I want to explain somethings here. Its not a win, but its not as big of a loss as it could have been.   This isn't like in America where its binary, he wins or he loses, its closer to the house, who got the most seats and who is the majority leader.   They won a minority, which means they got the most seats out of all the parties, but not enough. So say the Conservatives and the Bloc decided to team up they could out vote them.  Also, it looks like we gained a lot of conservative seats over last time. How did we lose then? Well the far far left NDP voters really didn't like Poilievre and strategically voted Liberal. Anyone telling you this is was his fault is wrong - he did the best we could ask for.   So is it a loss? Yes - but this isn't as bad as say Kamala Harris winning the presidency. Basically I expect shit isn't going to get done for the most part and we'll have an election soon than 5 years from now, basically whenever NDP thinks they can afford one and its advantageous of them to pick up more seats so they can help us vote for one.   That said,  in the unlikely event of anyone reading this has an ear to President Trump - tell him next election to shut the fuck up. We had this until all the 51st state talk.",mattcruise,2025-04-29T00:13:23,333
Why on earth would anyone want Canada to be part of the US when they are incredibly liberal? No thanks,UConnSimpleJack,2025-04-29T06:53:11,46
"Poilievre supported Canada taking in 200-250k permanent resident immigrants a year. This guy supported mass migration and did not deserve a victory when his only qualification was ""not Trudeau."" Right-wing Canadians deserve better than that. If you want to see what this approach gets a country in the long-term, look no further than Britain with its useless Tories.  When Carney took the stage as a *relatively* more moderate candidate compared to Trudeau, Poilievre could barely distinguish himself from him.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-29T00:12:57,114

Good job canada litterally selling your country out to China. Somehow managed to pick someone even worse than truduea. Its gonna be rough for you good luck.,ultrainstict,2025-04-29T06:05:24,2
"That's a shame - More of the same ruinous policies for Canadians.   Granted the Trump shenanigans were singularly unhelpful, but the fact that people couldn't see they were being completely played by the Liberals on that point and bought into it 100% is more than a little sad. ",WPWeasel,2025-04-29T05:42:29,4

Canada committing suicide through liberals along with the rest of the Anglo Commonwealth. No surprise.,Far-prophet,2025-04-29T09:18:33,1
lol some of the comments here  Did Trump hold a gun to their head in the voting booth and force them to vote liberal?,plitspidter,2025-04-29T04:28:19,-6

"The people voted for who they want, irregardless of Trump's comments. They still want higher home prices and constant immigration, alignment with China, so be it.  Trump will just increase rhetoric at this point. Canada chose to keep a liberal in power.",BucDan,2025-04-29T08:39:38,-2
This is great. Now Canada can break up slowly with Alberta first to join the US and more can follow.,the445566x,2025-04-29T00:22:50,-30
This is actually great news. The mainstream conservative Canadian party is similar to the UK tories. They are bad. They will poison the well for the Canadian right. With liberals leading again it opens the door for potential actual right in the future.,kaytin911,2025-04-29T00:50:03,-30

"Trust us, we've been telling him to stop his trash talking and nonsense tweeting for over a decade now.   He's not going to ever change.  We're sorry that he cost your conservative citizens the election.  Despite what the media and Leftists try to spin, we still really like our northern allies and wish nothing but the best for you.     Hopefully this won't make things too difficult for you until your next election cycle.",MildlyBemused,2025-04-29T03:48:27,62
"Sure he won't have that much power but the issue is Canada is already on the wrong track because of the previous liberal administrations. If nothing changes Canada is still fucked they needed a conservative win to try and get back on the right path, although I think Canada is too far gone already.",Hectoriu,2025-04-29T02:46:51,-20

"Nobody who has ever read Carney’s book or paid the smallest bit of attention to his career and public statements would consider him “moderate.”  Mark Carney is one of the most terrifying human beings on the planet, and he is far more radical and ruthless than Justin Trudeau.",collymolotov,2025-04-29T01:06:35,-7
Yes he would have poisoned the well for the Canadian right. This is great news. Good riddance.,kaytin911,2025-04-29T00:51:04,-17
"I really hate the Trump did this mindset. Canada is already incredibly liberal and they are importing millions of left votes yearly. Saying Trump did this is the left being way too self important, not everything is about them and their issues.",Hectoriu,2025-04-29T02:49:08,8
Thats what they want you to think. Remember in the liberal mindset everything is trumps fault. Even if a meteor hit the earth.,Jurclassic5,2025-04-29T07:34:25,11

"Can you elaborate on that? Most of us have very little idea of Canadian politics, and the media is doing its best to portray Carney as a reasonable, moderate savior.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-29T03:31:12,39
"Mark Carney wrote a political manifesto called *Values: Building a Better World for All.*  The ""Values"" of which he speaks are not moral values but are the ""values"" of what a human life (and quality of life) is worth when it comes to technocratic measures in the name of saving the planet from the alleged apocalypse of climate change. It is interesting that he notes that individual human beings are not capable of assessing the value of their own lives, and that this must be assessed by the State.  Carney advocates in this text a totalitarian system of government in which each and every aspect of a persons life is controlled by powerful, centralized state authority, and to which all personal decisions are subject to ESG/DEI/Carbon Credit metrics. He explicitly advocates for a central bank digital currency linked to social credit scoring to facilitate this.  Carney explicitly states that a decrease in both the quality of life and the *quantity* of life (IE number of people, years of life lived) is acceptable in pursuit of this broader net-zero agenda, which is granted religious levels of latitude in how it can be imposed. It is effectively positioned as being *the new state religion:* literally everything in terms of public policy must revolve around achieving net-zero, including how individuals are permitted to invest and spend their own money.  Carney also explicitly states that the peoples of developed, advanced, first-world but carbon-intensive) countries like Canada should ""look to the wisdom"" of the most impoverished nations in the world when it comes to how they should expect to live under this regime, he explicitly cites Niger, the Central African Republic and similar countries as examples of the standard of living we should expect.  It is an argument for a return to feudalism, and a plan for how such a regime might viably be brought about.  Mark Carney is, in short, a viable candidate for being the *literal fucking Antichrist* if you believe in that sort of thing.  This subject was never discussed even once by the mainstream media in Canada during the 36 day election campaign, the shortest period permitted by law after he was installed in a Liberal Party leadership contest in which 89% of the vote was in his favour after 350,000 ballots were thrown out and his two anti-establishment challengers disqualified, the rules of which permit foreign citizens who affirm that they reside in Canada and children as young as 14 to cast a ballot. Ultimately roughly 150,000 internal party votes made him our Prime Minister after Justin Trudeau resigned. Mark Carney had never been elected to any previous office.",collymolotov,2025-04-29T03:48:16,25

"Marvelous. I expected nothing good, but this is ludicrous.  If it's any consolation, I am German and we have genuinely evil people from the same cabal in power. ESG, DEI, mass migration, carbon certificates, that kind of stuff is their religion, and you better believe they are going to convert all of us forcefully, unless we start actually defending ourselves.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-29T04:26:14,10
"One thing common to all of the WEF types is this:  They want everybody else to live like peasants.  They will still have private jets, 3 huge homes, large luxury automobiles, vacations on tropical islands in private private resorts that cost $10,000 a day, and hand tailored suits.  The rest of just live in a one bedroom apartment and get 2 new shirts per year.",WIlf_Brim,2025-04-29T07:29:03,11
