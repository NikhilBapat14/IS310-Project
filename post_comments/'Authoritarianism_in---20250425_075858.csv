"Thing is there probably is by the letter or the law  “illegal”activity at ActBlue. Just as there is at every other political fundraising organization. The entire political “donation” and fund raising industry is nothing but legalized money laundering, bribery, and fraud.   So be ready for screaming headlines about all the illegal activity found at ActBlue, with no mention about every other political organization that is almost certainly doing the same things",DrEmil-Schaffhausen,2025-04-25T08:35:53,0

"How would it be money laundering though? The money doesn't go back into the hands of the one donating. Also, nothing but? There's heaps of people actually donating because they actually support the cause. Especially considering ActBlue supposedly consists of mostly small donations by individuals. Where would the bribery even be? They change a law because Billy donates 10 bucks?

"What are you talking about like the first 3 articles alone when you look are money laundering. Trump uses campaign funds to fund Maralago, reorganizes campaign funds to “pac”, trump uses campaign cash to pay personal legal bills. Florida, desantis illegally coordinating PAC money, New York mayor illegally using campaign money, list goes on.  Because of Citizens United nigh infinite dark money is funneled into campaign or PAC funds that are frequently laundered for purposes beyond their intended spending",Mediumcomputer,2025-04-25T12:34:58,-1
