"Unfortunately this was largely caused by Trump tariffing Canada and making those silly claims about making Canada the 51st state. The Conservatives there were absolutely leading and set to have a massive win, but Trump caused an about face in the polls. [Polling data shows that.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2025_Canadian_federal_election#Pre-campaign_period) If he'd waited a few months we would've had a pretty friendly government in Canada, but instead we have those assholes to deal with.",ergzay,2025-04-29T03:37:01,58
"I'd say this is a case of Canada having national Stockholm syndrome, but it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge that Trump's 51st state comments basically nuked the ""Conservatives"" there, they were on track for the largest majority in Canadian history, and all he had to do was shut his mouth for 4 months.  Secondly, calling the Canadian Conservatives conservative is like calling a dog a cat. Not only are they an ineffectual party led by sheep in wolf's clothing, but their positions are cowardly and inadequate.  Canada gonna Canada though.",IamLiterallyAHuman,2025-04-28T22:08:46,353
"I blame Trump on this one, the tariff war with Canada makes almost zero sense, actually most of this tariff war makes zero sense.  It enraged the lefts base in Canada and to be frank made conservative sit it out to their detriment. You can see it all in the polls, deny it...its your cognitive dissonance getting in the way.  This is another bellwether for conservatives, along with Trump's tanking poll numbers.  Trump has spend so much political capital on his tariff war this might go down as the largest self-own in history.  I hope Trump gets this hint and reverses course on tariffs to focus on things that with actually MAGA.",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-29T06:46:56,31

"It destroyed their polling because Trudeau also conveniently stepped down right around the same time. The same Trudeau that was effectively forced out by his own party because he was destroying their polling and causing internal strife.  Poilievre’s entire focus the last 3 years has been the carbon tax and Trudeau’s disastrous management that was fragmenting the Liberals. Yet when Trudeau stepped down and Carney won the Prime Minister race, everyone rallied behind him despite Freeland losing and everyone who pissed and moaned about a banker buying his way in mysteriously shut up when he won the election in a landslide.  Another thing that Carney did was repeal the carbon tax and is now talking about assembling the Canadian Parliament early to pass tax cuts. Poilievre has been campaigning so long on being anti-Trudeau and anti-carbon tax that he was unable to readjust his footing and pivot to anything that might resemble change. The only other thing Poilievre really had was the cost of living crisis and even that started showing signs of going away after the carbon tax repeal spurred an almost immediate gas price drop.  So yes, the collapse of the Conservative polling from being unable to pivot from the current leadership is a disaster of their own making, not because Trump stoked Canadian nationalism from the 51st state talks and tariffs.",MT_2A7X1_DAVIS,2025-04-29T07:32:17,7

The UK conservatives did the exact same thing and completely blew a slam dunk opportunity to obtain significant conservative political power there for decades. The results in these countries should serve as a reminder of what would've happened to the republican party in the US if not for Trump. Just like we see in senate and house races now where the party still doesn't get it.",day25,2025-04-28T23:53:01,-15
"> the media will cover for him.  Trump doesn't care how our media covers him, I can't imagine he can even name a Canadian media firm.",crash______says,2025-04-29T06:53:15,0
"That stuff is genuinely too high-level and distant for the average voter to care about even if they were aware of it. It's not an impossible type of politician to defeat, they just have to be railed against in a populist way. Poilievre was unfortunately not the guy to do that.   It's a shame too, because European and American right-wing parties are going in a much more positive direction. Canada/NZ/Australia are late to the party.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-29T03:11:11,7
"All they do is propagandize the population with a narrative then push poll them on that narrative. If Canadians are never exposed to the opposite narrative of course the people in these polls wouldn't support it it goes against all their social proof and perceived authorities. Their polls said Kamala would win Iowa how did that turn out? Institutionalists are notoriously untrustworthy and incompetent when it comes to polling populist support and related issues. Which is why they are routinely wrong. We know for a fact three times in a row against a hated Liberal government the conservatives in Canada have tried to run a RINO TDS campaign, and each time they got destroyed.  And btw, the first election against the hated Liberals the conservatives had a chance to elect a populist as their leader who was by far the most popular among the grass roots supporters. The party base voted for him to be the leader in a landslide but what happened was the establishment dairy cartel rigged the vote and stuffed the ballot box with votes from new ""conservative"" memberships they bought in a sleazy op to quash populism in the party by literally a 0.1% margin. If it wasn't popular the establishment conservatives wouldn't need to do corrupt stuff like this and then go on to lose every election anyway.",day25,2025-04-29T23:50:37,0
"Projection as usual. It's exactly how he ran his campaign from the moment the tariffs started. I couldn't tell him apart from a leftist with TDS.  This was literally his [response](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1885819065710829892) to the tariffs. Instead of blaming the Liberals, he actually said the tariffs were ""unjustified"" (aka. it's not the Liberal's fault)! He called for Canadians to ""unite"" (effectively saying to support the current Liberal government). Did he forget which party he was running for?  It's so cringe. The icing on the cake is the bolded **Canada First Plan** so in the same post that he's attacking Trump he's using language from Trump's America First movement! Unbelievable.  And [look what he posted literally on election day](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1916854056183644583). And now you want to gaslight us and pretend that attacking Trump wasn't the very core of his campaign strategy? Well guess what - it was 100%. He ran a RINO campaign and got RINO results.",day25,2025-04-29T23:31:42,1
