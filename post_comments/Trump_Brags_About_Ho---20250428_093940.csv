Trump Brags About How Much Fun He’s Having ~~Running~~ Ruining ‘the World’,AndyB1976,2025-04-28T09:43:33,41
"In his interview with the editor who broke the [Signalgate leak scandal](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-team-leaks-war-plans-to-the-atlantic-editor-jeffrey-goldberg-in-jaw-dropping-security-fiasco/)—the president appeared to ignore his tumultuous first 100 days in office and news of record-low approval ratings, and literally declared that he runs the world.  “The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,” Trump said when asked if this term felt different from his first. “And the second time, I run the country and the world.”  But Trump’s trademark hubris glossed over the fact that he has failed to deliver on [key campaign promises](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-worst-first-100-days-of-any-administration-in-history/) and has, actually, made some things much worse. Trump, however, doesn’t care. In fact, he’s enjoying “blowing up” the White House: “I’m having a lot of fun, considering what I do.”  [**Click here to read the story**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-brags-about-how-much-fun-hes-having-running-the-world/).",thedailybeast,2025-04-28T09:39:55,14
