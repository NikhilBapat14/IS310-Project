"I don’t know much about Bessent, although I did just read that he has previously supported Gore, Obama, and HRC and he’s a very out gay man, but he has seemingly been the closest thing to an adult in the room over the last few days.  It really would’ve been fun to see that spectacle.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-24T01:27:34,3

"Rupert Murdoch paper uses WWE mention to drive clicks, what a non-surprise.  The Times is no different from The Sun, The New York Post, nor Fox News. All owned by the same awful people.  All drivel, none worth the paper they're printed on nor the electrons on your screen.  The amount of damage this man & his family have done to the world ...",4LAc,2025-04-24T03:08:58,2

"Musk apparently went around Bessent to appoint the new IRS commissioner by just bringing some papers to Trump, who signed without reading. Normally the Treasury head appoints the comm. So that got overturned. Gary Shapley, Musk's pick, lasted 4 days. Bessent appointed his guy in replacement.",MonkeyCube,2025-04-24T02:18:00,11
"I've never understood kayfabe (but I also don't like wrestling (or any other sports where people are hurting each other (or are pretending to), so I may be biased)..
