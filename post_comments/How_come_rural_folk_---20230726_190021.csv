"The mid-west used to be pretty middle of the road I think what happened was AM radio and Fox news.  There's not a lot going on in these places and people send a lot more time in their cars than other places, anyone  that has spent hours in the car knows after a while you stop listening to music and more over to talk -because it's not repetitive.  The problem is the only talk on the radio since 1983 is Right-wing, these people have been fed a steady diet of right-wing bullshit for decades and that stuff sinks in.  Understand that these places are not diverse in any way, so people like to follow and the right-wing propaganda is easy to follow, it tells them that they are the ""real Americans"" and that all their troubles are the fault of the Democrats, the liberals and immigrants.  This has been going on for 40+ years and the internet accelerated the conversion.  There are still liberals and middle of the road people in rural areas but they won't speak up because they don't want to be exiled, just another example of ""good people"" who don't speak up.",tossme68,2023-08-11T23:51:51,7
"Environmentalism is likely the biggest culprit. The Democratic Party strongly supports an view of environmental stewardship based on the ideas of urban elites.  However, such a view directly threatens the livelihood of rural workers - who depend on agriculture and extraction industries.  This leads to a situation where the nominal party of ""Labor"" is working against the best interests of the actual laborers. As a result, those voters are given a choice between a party which will implement policies that negatively impact their lives (Democrats) and a party that will largely just leave them alone (Republicans).",ViskerRatio,2023-08-04T12:57:10,5

"u/Welpe gave a pretty good answer.    But as someone who grew up in a rural area and now lives in a city what I can say is that the rural folks want to work, they want jobs, they want to provide. They want their family and community and to be able to live their lives.     They don't care about wealth put on display as is in most urban America. They don't want Gucci and 3500 sq ft mini mansions, they just want a roof over their head and to be able to provide.  It really gets me when people say red or rural states vote against their own interests because it's 100 percent clear to me that they have no idea where their interests lay. It's not that same as city folks. That's the economic part of it.  The social side of it is tradition. Most rural places are culturally similar, meaning white Christians.  The understanding of Muslims or Asians or any other immigrant culture is based on what is shown on the news. And if we're honest, the news shows the bad and rarely the good so they are distrustful of  they see. I don't blame rural communities for not knowing what they don't know. How can they?    So they will continue voting the party that sells itself as being moral and Christian and preserving jobs and the ""American way"" because ultimately they just want to stay the same as it ever was and ever will be. And they want to be left alone about it.",Purple_Pansy_Orange,2023-08-04T16:40:12,3
"The US has had left-wing agrarian parties in the past.  The key thing to differentiate is between left-wing on economic issues, and left-wing on social issues.  Rural areas tend to be right-wing on social issues, but on economic issues it can go either way; so it becomes a question of which issues they're primarily focusing on when they vote.  Right now they're focusing more on social issues than economic issues.  The hatred instilled against socialism/communism is far stronger than it is in Latin America, I'm not really sure there's any in latin america, but in the US, as a result of the Cold War against the soviet union, there's a lot of anti-communist sentiment, especially amongst more conservative groups.  In Europe they more often have parliamentary systems, and quite a few have systems other than first past the post, so small focused parties are more viable.  In the US, there were times, moreso a few decades ago, that when it came to a farm issue, Congressfolk would vote the farming interests of their state regardless of party alignment, and that was widely accepted and just the norm.  This lessened the pressure to have any sort of special farm interest.",zlefin_actual,2023-08-02T08:45:52,2
"In  the USA, right wing ideology also has a basis in the idea of, ""leave me alone to do whatever I want"" This is easier to sell to people in rural areas who probably live out there because they want to do their own thing with as little government intervention as possible. ""Don't tread on me"" and all that. Whereas Left wing ideology is based more around heavier government involvement, and the people who often feel like they need that the most are likely people who live in more urban and/or expensive places and have a desire for the government to pitch in and help them out.",christian_daddy1,2023-08-06T18:59:58,2
It was not the case that long ago.  I can not speak to other nations. But in USA the rural area have become less populace as young people simply leave after high school or college.  Only ones left are old people.  Go to NY or FL or CA and you will meet a lot of young people from places like Iowa or Oklahoma or Montana.  They will tell you that they left as soon as they could.  I have been told people leaving a week after their high school graduation or a week after college graduation.  They all say the same thing as nothing to do and every young person who can just gets out.  I remember one group from Iowa I meet they said that half of their high school graduating class left the state the summer they graduated.  Its insane how the rural area are drained.,BlackPriestOfSatan,2023-08-10T11:47:57,2
"It’s a mixture of things — a toxic brew of lack of education, most of,the young people leaving for better paying careers in cities, Christianity teaching them that they’re always persecuted, and the unrelenting negative impact of conservative media 24x7.",Dr_CleanBones,2023-08-22T23:09:23,2
"Why does it seem people paint Conservatives with this broad Christian brush ? It is absolutely not the case. Most aren’t religious at all. Its rarely even discussed. Ive lived in multiple states in rural areas. Know literally hundreds of people that have lived anywhere from 5 miles out of town, to 25 miles to the nearest store you could buy gas. I would say maybe 1/8 of them are church goers.    Its been my experience, that zlefin_actual is the closest. Its the issues. Peoples personal issues do not affect them. On the federal level, they believe the country should work, how it is designed to work. Those are state issues. Which they are. That is the whole reason behind having states. Most are very much “leave me alone, and I will leave you alone.” Many even lean left on many issues. Legalization of weed, etc. They are actually very liberal people. Liberal by definition. Which is freedom.      Another issue I see is the focus on education. Intelligent people can educate themselves. By doing so, they are actually thinking more for themselves. They aren’t subjected to Professors beliefs or forced specific reading. Fairly often overly educated, is also overly indoctrinated. Because they learned what they were told. Which is really not that difficult, but gives them the “I have a piece if paper that says I know something about a subject or two. Therefore I must be very smart.” kind of mentality.  Which is rarely, actually the case. It seems many of those people miss out on the part where you learn the most. Life experience, in multiple environments. Definitely not always the case, but it appears to happen often.   I apologize for the Infj, encyclopedia size response. Lol",pinealprime,2023-10-18T17:48:37,2
I was listening to one farmer talk about it period he said he thinks a lot of it is driven by the consolidation of radio stations period he said he remembers that back in the 60s most radio stations were little local affairs.  That would give you a wider sense of people in the area period he suggested. That when especially in some areas where the Christian stations started controlling huge numbers of these small radio stations that the messaging became much more limited and one-sided.,Head-like-a-carp,2023-10-24T14:14:50,2

"This hasn't always been the case, and there have been strong leftist movements among the agrarian class in the US at various times in the past.  In more recent history, Iowa used to be one of the core ""weathervane"" states that was always within a percentage point of the national result from 1992-2012, though Trump changed that.  I don't think there is any single factor however, it's a very complex issue.  The simplest explanation is that it's cultural issues that overwhelmingly dominate economic issues in US politics to a degree, and the Republican party has been able to successfully position itself as the vanguard of ""traditional values"" that rural Americans tend to value more than anything.    One of the consistently silly mistakes that the left makes is to frame everything in terms of economic divisions, which works wonderfully when you are trying to write a position paper in college from a Marxist perspective, but doesn't really correlate to how actual people tend to vote, at least here in the US.  It's easy to pretend that it's just a matter of how the Republicans have campaigned hard to mislead people about what socialism is and lack of education, especially in rural areas, has allowed them to get away with it...which is true to some extent, but is insulting to act as if it were the only reason and that they are voting against their own interests because they are ""rubes"".  The truth is that while poverty is always a concern, rural Americans tend to value ""God, Guns, and Family"" as much more immediately important interests than economic systems.  For better or worse, the left in the US has no interest in appealing to these things and so it is very easy for the Republicans to pin them as ""the opposition"".  For many of those people, it doesn't matter if you could GUARANTEE them a better personal financial outcome if they see you as being irreligious, anti-gun, or pro any number of social policies that can be construed as ""anti-family"", many of which are very important to more left-leaning voters.  I'd also maybe disagree tentatively with your first point.  Although it appears to be decreasing over time, in the 2020 census over 76% of rural Americans identified as White Non-Hispanic, about 15% higher than the country as a whole.  That's down from just under 80% in 2010 by the way.  Though you did just say ""substantial"" and that's not very strictly defined, so if you count 9% for Hispanics and 7.7% for Blacks, I guess I can't disagree, but those are quite a bit lower than the overall numbers.  They aren't absent per se, but they are definitely under-represented.",Welpe,2023-08-02T01:51:35,1
"There might be exceptions to this, but historically more rural people tend to be conservative. For instance, in the Middle Eastern and Asian countries conservative values are in rural places. Women dress traditionally and little has changed through the centuries. The cities are the ones where new ideas are formed, and where there is greater acceptance of Western liberal values and perspectives.  The US, Canada and other places rural communities don’t experience change like the cities do. There is automatically more diversity in the cities. New immigrants and refugees tend to live in cities because they have greater employment opportunities. They are familiar and so are not as threatening.  Rural communities have less people and those who have different values, religions, practices, skin colours, accents and mating habits stand out. In cities these people blend in. Anyone can walk along a city sidewalk and experience the all sorts of non-conformists, exotic commodities and languages. So city dwellers are more accustomed to change, diversity, new ideas, and are not threatened by such things and so are more liberal. Rural communities have much more constancy in those things and feel more uncomfortable when new ideas, people and values are thrust upon them, and so are more conservative.",MangoMalarkey,2023-11-02T18:35:45,1
"The reason poor people in America are not socialist is because socialists expect the rich to share their wealth with the poor. People who originally immigrated to America had the possibility of wealth and classlessness dangled in front of them. Everyone could be rich if they worked hard enough.   So if you want the rich to share their wealth you have to admit that, a) you are of a lower class in a classless society, b) you will never be rich and get to look down on the poor like the rich are now doing to you, c) you don’t want to work hard enough to become rich yourself but want the state to give you other people’s money, d) you are a failure as an American because you failed to become rich when supposedly you had every opportunity to do so.  The poor people in the poorest states tend to be the most hostile to socialism because they think a) the rich deserve their wealth, and b) they deserve their poverty. That’s why they are against government handouts of any kind and proudly vote Republican, a party that does not give one fig about them at all.",MangoMalarkey,2023-11-02T18:56:51,1

"I had some good friends who listened and were big Rush Limbaugh fans. So I started listening and reading so I could shoot down those evil ideas.   What I found was that Rush was telling people to not beleive what was on mainstream media, they tell half-truths and lie and manipulate. He would give examples, and he was correct. When someone tells you what you want to hear, and backs it up with facts, you get pretty set in your ways.  While I learned to fact check mainstream media, I also fact checked the alternative stories as well. It seems that once Rush pointed out the lied on the left people unquestionably believed him. (This is the same thing the left suffers from, if you beleive in the NYT, you always beleive them, even when they are wrong)  In one way Rush was good at telling you to do your own research, but he was trusted so much that people went along with whatever he said.",other_view12,2023-08-17T13:58:10,4
"Leave them alone? You should finish the sentence: “leave the alone to face the negative consequences of the rapidly approaching climate disaster.

In my book, there’s nothing worse than a man who knows good and well than man-made climate change real and is already causing extreme weather, yet who knows that agricultural and extractive industry workers are generally under educated and therefore are unable to accurately analyze self-serving contrary climate opinions, and who encourages those workers to ignore what’s surely coming and to under value science,  all so that his investments in those same industries will continue for a few more years.",Dr_CleanBones,2023-08-22T22:38:41,2

"First, the apocalypse you're envisioning isn't going to happen and no one seriously claims it will. Over the course of a human lifetime, the climate changes are normally only perceptible with data analysis and precise instruments - they're not something that is going to meaningfully impact the day-to-day lives of such people.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to it. But let's not pretend that such a grand scale issue is of direct interest to them.  To put this in perspective, 11-year solar cycles cause a greater temperature shift over time (although it oscillates rather than going one way) than carbon forcing does. Yet no one out is stepping outside and saying ""Yep... we're in the 3rd year of the 11-year cycle"". The change is simply too small to detect on a human scale.  > yet who knows that agricultural and extractive industry workers are generally under educated  It depends on what you're talking about. If you're talking about the people who pick your vegetables, true. If you're talking about the people who run the farms or the skilled/professional labor working in extractive industries, you're incorrect. Those latter people are generally far more educated - especially in terms of science and technical knowledge - than the norm.  More importantly, they can do the math. They are being asked to bear the lion's share of the cost for other people's concerns and it should come as no shock that they're unwilling to accept that bargain.",ViskerRatio,2023-08-22T22:47:57,2

And that’s who has an interest in making damn sure the workers aren’t educated enough to,figure our what climate change will bring. Today’s owners and investors know today’s industries will suffer, but they don’t care - they’re only interested in today, not 10 years from now.

Would you ever expect your neighbor to give up their weekend to mow your lawn, let alone lay a new driveway, or feed your family for a week if you’re sick. But in rural America that is lifestyle.
