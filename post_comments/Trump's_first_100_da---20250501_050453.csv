Reconstruction was of course very unpopular in the South and when the Democrats won back Congress in the early 1870's following the economic recession caused by the demobilization efforts after the war, Congress defunded Reconstruction efforts, and as part of the corrupt bargain of the 1876 presidential election, reconstruction as a policy formally ended.",Willem_Dafuq,2025-05-01T08:26:57,43

"I'm fortunately in a really good, racially diverse public school and my students by and large are pretty aware. But it's a well-to-do suburb and I live in the impoverished city that it's next to so the disparity in educational offerings and outcomes is apparent.  The lesson we did on Korematsu v US was great cause kids were drawing very clear parallels with CECOT. It was not the same in my old district where the kids were well below grade level and US history didn't have a tangible impact on their worldview as much because they were operating on survival instinct.  I just didn't have the emotional stamina to keep working in an underfunded, crumbling district til I retire.",Pike_Gordon,2025-05-01T11:26:07,8
"It would take someone with the clout of Bernie and AOC.

"We need to get away from people electing old people because it‚Äôs their ‚Äòturn‚Äô.  Hillary ran because it was her turn, despite the fact that there was deeply ingrained hatred for her among a lot of the population, and Dems didn‚Äôt read the room.  There has been at least once where, for example, AOC was going to head a committee but they gave it to some old guy because he had waited for it and he was up for it.  Nothing about whether or not he was the right person for the job.  Radical change requires young people (Bernie is an outlier).",atlantagirl30084,2025-05-01T10:09:03,1
"Oh, friend. I get that. I was teaching in a remote Inuit community with an extra traumatic past for my last posting.   If I ever teach again it will not be in a challenging community.",enonmouse,2025-05-01T11:30:34,2
