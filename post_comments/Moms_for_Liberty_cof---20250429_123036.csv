">Tina Descovich, a former member of Brevard's school board, was appointed to the commission by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2024, then again in February 2025 after the Senate chose not to confirm her. In 2024, she was allowed to remain in her post. Because this marks the second time the Senate declined to consider her as a nominee, she can't be reappointed, and she'll be required to leave her post.  Sounds like someone should have had more GOP lesbian threesomes.",dblan9,2025-04-29T13:07:09,13
