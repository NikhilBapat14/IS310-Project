I'm always down for more holidays and excuses to get together. Why not just have a Victory Day celebrating victory in both WWs and leave Veterans day alone though,ElderberryMental101,2025-05-03T12:53:13,3
I would love more Holidays celebrating US Military and the accomplishments.  Tired of giving WHOLE months to some stupid thing but we don't remember the good things we did and accomplished.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:37:21,1
