More like an eight-year old president.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-05T09:34:44,5
"This should be cut-in, wall-to-wall breaking news on every broadcast in the country.   The US is a constitutional democracy. Our government is based on a constitution, which is held as the supreme law of the land. The constitution and laws passed using the process outlined in the constitution limit the powers of the government.   Our highest-officed representative has spent months (including the last few days) talking about how he doesn’t think he has to abide by the supreme law of the land. That our government’s powers with him at the helm are not subject to the limits put on them by the people.  It’s a big fucking deal, but apparently the media is going to continue freedom-washing fascism in realtime, because they know most the people in this country are so fucking dumb that they won’t care. ",ddark4,2025-05-05T09:59:22,4
"He'll be a fascist dictator if he says fuck the constitution and its not ""Just trolling"" if he keeps trying to entertain the idea   Really want to emphasize to MAGA/Republicans:   Do you really want to run an 82 year old dude who is clearly showing his age already at 78? You have plenty of other republican talent who are much younger that you can legally run (since trump cannot due to the 22nd amendment)",blues111,2025-05-05T09:41:11,2

"And when he changes his mind in three years, will the media go back to talking about how this is shocking, unexpected, and totally unprecedented again?  Of course they will, because this kind of head-in-the-sand reporting is good for their business.",OkayComputer1701,2025-05-05T10:40:41,1
"People in here trusting the Constitution and norms to keep him from a 3rd term are kidding themselves. We've seen him telegraph his moves in advance this way, floating the idea in advance to get people used to it regardless of legality, then does it anyway.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-05T10:41:21,1
