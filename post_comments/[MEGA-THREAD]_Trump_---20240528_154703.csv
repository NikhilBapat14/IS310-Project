"Does [Richardson v United States](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1998/97-8629) apply to this case or any non-federal case?  Contrary to the jury instructions for the Trump trial, in which the judge said the jury didn't need to agree on the underlying crime in order to find him guilty of the felonious crime (leaving that discussion for another day), it would seem that it would run against this precedent... except it was for a federal crime, not a state crime.  And I'm not sure if its incorporated like the constitutional rights are.  For those who don't want to click the link, Richardson said that the jury had to be unanimous on the entire *series* of crimes, not just the final one.  That is, almost entirely opposite what the jury instructions were here - they'd have to agree to the entire set, not just the final step.",LordFoxbriar,2024-05-28T21:38:26,2
