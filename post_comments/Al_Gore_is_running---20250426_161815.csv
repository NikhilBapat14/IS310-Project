"""Democrats have no good candidates, that's why they're pushing...  - Hillary Clinton   - Hillary Clinton (again)  - Joe Biden (again, from the 80s)  - Kamala Harris (unpopular VP)  ... and now Al Gore?   You love to see it lmao",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-26T23:55:00,9
I could see that.  He will try....thinking he has way too many skeletons in his closet though.  The infighting will bring all of them out in the open.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-26T19:36:04,7

"Yo he is going to get torn apart. Someone like Vance will outclass him and insult him 5 times before he can get a word out. They need to go back to the drawing board.  Vance will just say his ""All gore"" because he wants wars and its over after that.",No-Entertainer8627,2025-04-27T10:34:04,2

"I just finished reading Michael Crichton‚Äôs book State of Fear. He does a masterful job outlining the hypocritical and harmful effects of the environmentalist movement and the stupidity of how the global media and politics have muddied science and the work that could truly be done to address global needs like starvation, poverty, proper environmental management research, and disease research, instead opting to cast all of that aside for what is the biggest con job in history.",ITrCool,2025-04-26T19:44:54,9

"You should try to find a copy of the movie 'An Inconsistent Truth'. It was produced by Phil Valentine, who, if you're not aware, was a Nashville based talk radio host who was syndicated nationally for a time. He passed away from covid in 2021. It was really unfortunate in so many ways. I half expected him to get the job replacing Rush Limbaugh. He would have been phenomenal.",Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-04-27T08:10:07,2
I‚Äôd heard of that. It‚Äôs a total rebuttal to Gore‚Äôs flop film.,ITrCool,2025-04-27T08:21:15,2

"Yes. And as I understand, it did a phenomenal job of shredding algore's bullshit.",Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-04-27T08:22:14,3
Welcome. I was a huge fan of Phil Valentine. I figure getting the word out is a decent way to honor the memory of someone gone way too soon.,Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-04-27T17:12:17,1
