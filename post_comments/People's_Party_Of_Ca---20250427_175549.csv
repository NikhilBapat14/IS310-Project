Shades of the Truckers strike and Trudeau's freezing of their bank accounts! Canada no longer qualifies as a free country!,Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T19:09:20,83
Tomorrow we will find out how tired Canada is of liberal incompetence.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-27T18:32:56,36
99% of Canadians are afraid to stand up for themselves. Their timidity is just bewildering to me.,SpecialFree25,2025-04-27T22:14:15,14

Polymarket has 79% chance of Carney victory.  Poilievre was leading until Trump started trolling Canada about becoming the 51st state.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-28T09:49:46,11

"I got 20 dollars that says they will double down.  US dollars, not Canadian because those would be frozen too.",codifier,2025-04-27T21:45:03,18
"Agreed. May not be a landslide sweep for them, but my money’s on a “squeak by” election victory for their leftists, with just enough control over their parliament to enact their agenda.  Hopefully I’m wrong and we find out a pleasant surprise instead, that Canadians haven’t lost their minds after all.",ITrCool,2025-04-27T21:43:46,23
"After Trump's comments on Canada, which are not going over well with Canadian voters, the election is not going to give an accurate read of where Canadians are on the right-left spectrum; however they vote, I would assume that the result is probably going to be skewed leftward by Trump, so their actual sentiments are more rightward than the results.  Poilievre is not a fan of Trump, and he has [actively discouraged Trump from commenting on the election](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5271654-pierre-poilievre-trump-canada/), which is probably a sign that he knows Trump's comments are hurting him. The pull or influence of someone like Trump is big though, in a way that I think Americans are sometimes not able to appreciate. A large portion of Canadian voters (I have heard from some) equate Poilievre with Trump and a significant portion of these voters may vote Liberal in part out of spite against Trump.  There things I don't like about Poilievre, but they don't have anything to do with his relationship to Trump. He is pro-union and pro-minimum wage, two views I disagree with. He also opposes carbon tax (which I support, I like market-based approaches to environmental issues, and I like that the revenue from carbon tax can offset other more damaging taxes like income or payroll tax) and instead he adopts more management-intensive and restrictive approaches to energy and environmental issues, like he has supported a import ban on foreign oil, which is an anti-free-trade and anti-free-market intervention that I oppose. Overall though, I think Poilievre is a much better candidate than Trump and if I were given the choice of the two to lead either company, I would pick Poilievre without much thought; not only are his views closer to mine overall, but I think he's smarter and more competent, better able to represent a constituency, and just a more reasonable, balanced person.  I'm not Canadian though so it's a moot point.",cazort2,2025-04-28T17:00:45,2
"It's their country, if they want all their issues to continue by voting again for liberals it's their prerogative.  It's just unfortunate I'll have to pay double for ketchup potato chips because their country suffers more from TDS than US citizens do.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-28T10:16:56,2
"I wouldn't be surprised at 60-40 for Liberals when the votes come. Anti-Americanism is the strongest force in Canadian politics, and even their own Canadian patriotism stops and starts with their resentment for America.    It's a great move by the left; don't let the people look at their real situation or the reason they're overtaxed and overburdened with regulations, blame America so that people can be distracted with a fake issue, rather than a real one.    When Conservatives point out that America isn't the problem, Liberals call them names or unpatriotic, and claim they're just shills for the US, and use their own compliant media to shut the conversation down.  Can't let the people wake up and disturb the order of things like they are in the US.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-28T11:20:16,5
I agree with that.  It’s just unfortunate that Trump didn’t think far enough ahead to realize he’d have better luck negotiating trade deals with a Conservative than a Liberal.  He should have done what he could (legally) to help the Conservatives win.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-28T10:27:07,6
