"I have the best leopards. BEAUTIFUL leopards. People come up to me all the time and they say ""wow your leopards are amazing"". Everybody knows these leopards are the best. Everybody loves them. They eat faces to a degree never before seen on this earth. Adult faces, child faces, they don't even care! Give it up for my leopards, folks. We're going to take this country back and my leopards, let me tell you, they are going to be full. Letting your face get ripped off is going to take strength, but you're patriots, aren't you folks?",destinyeeeee,2025-04-07T16:46:53,25

"The winners of the ""fell for it again"" award.  His first term should have shown them his gross incompetence and his complete disregard for them, but a cult leader is always right, even when he's wrong.  The difference is, this time, he doesn't need them to vote for him again, so he can do exactly what he wants, and he doesn't need to hide his questionable actions anymore.  I just hope Trump voters who realized how massively fucked they are remember this in midterms and vote blue so senate and house dems can boot Trump out of office so hard he can't sit down for a month.",aaron_adams,2025-04-08T11:49:59,8

"All the republicans I know are all quiet now. Two months ago they were boasting about trump and now that their 401k took a dive, I don‚Äôt hear a peep out of them. If he‚Äôs really doing all these great things why aren‚Äôt they out celebrating all their wins?",mlineras,2025-04-07T17:18:09,24
Agreed! I bet the Conservative subreddit is praising all this stupid tariff bs this clown did too.,Shalar79,2025-04-07T19:13:38,8
I live in a liberal area but there‚Äôs this old man who is obsessed with trump and he really stands out bc I rides an adult trike all over town and it usually has full sized trump flags waving in the back. It‚Äôs always been this way. This week I saw him and for the first time- no trump flag. He‚Äôs flying an American flag and some yellow flag with a green seal. I don‚Äôt know what this flag means. For all I know he‚Äôs still maga. But I‚Äôve noted the change.,strange-loop-1017,2025-04-07T20:08:29,11
