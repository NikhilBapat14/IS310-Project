Please donâ€™t negotiate with a terrorist. Itâ€™s going to be short term gain (if you can call it that) for a world of long term pain. The goal should be to make his tariff misadventure fail so epically that he canâ€™t politically survive the next four years.Â ,Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-29T19:02:03,15
Don't appease him.  Make f\*\*king sure he regret every decision he took.,thieh,2025-04-29T18:49:24,18
This isnâ€™t specific to Trump by any means. US effort to persuade the world to support the idea of a global minimum tax started under Biden. https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/01/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-todays-agreement-of-130-countries-to-support-a-global-minimum-tax-for-the-worlds-largest-corporations/,Ok_Breakfast4482,2025-04-29T19:26:44,6
"In my experience as a historian, European leaders enacting a ""policy of appeasement"" to satisfy a fascist has not ended well...",thesammyjames,2025-04-29T19:22:07,7
It will never be enough. There is no appeasing this guy.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-29T18:56:02,5
"I wonder which eu governments. I could understand the Italian wanna be Trump lady would suck up and we got some semi dictators aswell that could find some reason, but the rest is just stupid if this is their play.",StrikingAnxiety5527,2025-04-30T00:29:43,1
"The world: Shits on Americans for not fighting a fascist dictator violently enough  Also the world:  Keeps looking for excuses to appease said fascist, consequently making our work harder.  Im disappointed, but historically these failures are not surprising.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-29T19:56:06,0

I seem to recall the appeasement strategy before. But where was it??? idk ðŸ¤·,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-29T19:24:48,0
I think they're buying time.,lurkylurkeroo,2025-04-29T21:58:41,0
"Yes please. As American, make us suffer. We, like Germany post WWII, need a punch in the fucking face. Make it so bad the world forces us to demilitarize too!",yourinternetmobsux,2025-04-29T19:11:49,8
Well then us consumers have to make it clear that any country that negotiates with trump will be boycotted.Â ,Bakedads,2025-04-29T20:04:16,1
"Agreed. But I think he's too narcissistic to regret things, he just blames others.",Initial_Abrocoma_642,2025-04-29T18:54:53,4
Because he can never appease his oligarch masters enough.,killjoygrr,2025-04-29T19:04:27,5
"you are mistaken the WW1 policy with the WW2 policy. The first one lead to the rise of fascism, the second one to a stable democratic government. The WW1 policy was penal, the WW2 policy supportive.",kaas-schaaf,2025-04-30T01:42:23,1
"Make *his voters* regret it. Trump lives too privileged a life to ever feel the consequences of his actions, but his voters absolutely can and will.",LittleSnuggleNugget,2025-04-29T20:45:32,6
I think a decent portion will regret it. Once they have no job and they are homeless.,Initial_Abrocoma_642,2025-04-30T07:25:57,2
"Absolutely. We are all going to suffer for his administrationâ€™s actions, but only some of us saw it coming and took the time to prepare, while others stuck their heads in the sand and relaxed.",LittleSnuggleNugget,2025-04-30T07:45:29,1
