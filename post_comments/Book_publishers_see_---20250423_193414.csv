"It's probably a bit dated by now, but I'd also suggest a book called The Words We Live By by Linda R. Monk for any laypersons out there who want to increase their understanding of the Constitution and some of the historical context of its various parts. I read it years ago and still remember how it helped give me a better grasp on things.",seven_corpse_dinner,2025-04-23T19:48:32,7
"Federalist 68's argument in favor of requiring the president to be born on US soil:  >Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one querter, but *chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union?*  Federalist 68's argument for the electoral college:  >The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. **Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States.** It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue.  That worked out well.  If there is any president who has ""talents for low intrigue"", it is the current occupant of the White House.",I405CA,2025-04-23T19:51:32,4

"This is like the surge in Google searches for ""what is a tariff"" after the election. Little late to want to finally check what he Constitution says.   It's one of many reasons why we are a dying state.",InfinityComplexxx,2025-04-23T21:00:59,3

"It's extremely ironic that the electoral college, which was meant to make it harder for a creature like Donald Trump to win the presidency, was used by Trump as the means of gaining that esteemed office.",KimmyT1436,2025-04-23T19:56:07,5

"The irony is painful, although it should be noted that this was a sort of back-filled explanation.    The real motivation was that the slave states wanted to have their slave populations provide them with representation but without giving those slaves the vote.    The result was the 3/5ths compromise, and the electoral college was part of that.  States such as Virginia ended up with more House members and electoral votes for the president.",I405CA,2025-04-23T19:59:34,5
