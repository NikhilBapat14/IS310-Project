"How does this break before the midterms, if trump is too proud to admit he was wrong and an R majority in Congress is too scared to impeach?  What offroads do we have, if these two assumptions are true?  Even after the midterms, he likely cannot be impeached and convicted unless the D's have an unbelievable landslide in the Senate.  They would have to flip something like 17 of the 20 R seats up for reelection, while holding all of the 13 seats they have up for reelection.

The problem is that the chaos trump is causing is also generating an enormous amount of wealth for himself and his family.  He is perfectly happy to sacrifice the nation for personal wealth.    I think trump is perfectly happy with how this is playing out.,rogozh1n,2025-04-28T09:13:39,3
Exactly. It not even that he has to contend with the media. The reporting on Trump is so vanilla soft that it‚Äôs infuriating. The most he gets for criticism from the major networks and outlets amounts to mild skepticism that his leadership may not be doing well. They‚Äôve sane washed his completely idiotic policies to the point where for many uneducated and/or uninformed may think that his failures are minor setbacks.  The guy started a trade war that absolutely everyone said he would lose and is losing. He may even be losing in a worse way than predicted. We don‚Äôt yet know what the impact truly will be. God forbid something doesn‚Äôt happen to add fuel to the fire like idk a Global Pandemic or an additional Financial Crisis. Thankfully none of that has ever happened before under a republican president.,hmr0987,2025-04-28T14:32:21,1
"When trump dies, the party will first eat itself as others try to assume his position of power.

"Thats what I think he will do, sadly no matter what he does the market will respond the same way- so the truth will not matter. As long as he caves before a huge financial crash or something. And for me. Him lifting all tariffs and lying about it is probably the best deal we will get, if we don‚Äôt get this deal and Trump plays stubborn then millions of retail workers will lose jobs.  Edit :  okay maybe not millions of retailer works will lose jobs, but enough for it to matter in unemployment stats",animalslover4569,2025-04-28T08:42:20,3
