The actual video needs to be put out and all of this speculation stopped. Karmelo has already been expelled from school while the Metcalf twin is still in school. Schools don’t do this unless there was a danger to other students. If the surviving twin was a danger he would have been expelled as well. ,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-18T10:47:42,322

I remember the father said less than 24 hours after his son was murdered in cold blood that he already forgave the perpetrator.  Do you think he feels the same way after being kicked out of a news conference with Karmelo's family and being told that his very presence was disrespectful? After Karmelo's supporters sent a SWAT team to his house? After seeing thousands of people loudly rally around Karmelo online simply because of his skin color and relishing in mocking his deceased son because of his skin color?,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T12:03:23,132

The more and more i read about this case the more and more depressing it gets. The father who has been publicly apologetic FOR HIS SONS DEATH is now being disrespectful. I bet you my entire life savings all he wanted to say he didn’t hate Karmelo and wanted to not have his son be the martyr for a race war. But no these ignorant idiots can’t even see that. Also the people comparing this case to the Breonna Taylor case makes me sick that’s was obviously government overreach and a man that feared that he was getting robbed at gun point this was a piece of shit kid who thought antagonizing someone counts as self defense.,Choice-Cycle1231,2025-04-18T11:28:10,110

You know how easy it is to not tell someone your a drug lord lol. They are people who lived entire lives and didn’t tell their partners they did horrible things in the past. Carlos Marcello was a crime lord and lived a regular life outside of it raised a family and everything.,Choice-Cycle1231,2025-04-18T15:09:49,4
