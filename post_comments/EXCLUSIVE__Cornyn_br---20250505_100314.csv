I'm sorry but what the FUCK.  This is what Cornyn is bringing to the floor.  THIS is the executive order they're going to try to codify?  THIS is what they're doing?  Before codifying tax cuts?  Before codifying  executive action at the border?  Border codifying anything with DOGE?  I swear the GOP congressional delegation is more useless than a wet towel at the bottom of the ocean.,pimanac,2025-05-05T10:15:13,13
"Completely agree, but I don't think Cornyn has the power to codify tax cuts. For that, he's just one of many chamber votes. This is just to remind the pedocrats of what they did to her.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-05T11:25:12,1
