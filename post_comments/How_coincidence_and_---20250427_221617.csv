Trump’s “opinion” is literally from the last person that talked to him.,Beforemath,2025-04-28T00:05:00,7
The world saw him get cold shouldered by macron in favor of Zelensky. He needed to save face in his own narcissistic mind. If he gets asked he’ll say Zelensky was begging to make a deal.,Physical-Dare5059,2025-04-27T22:24:46,5

A deal was already made. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons for territorial integrity guarantees by the United States. Why would you want another deal that’s worthless?  Trump is a fucking illiterate moron.,Sad-Demand6732,2025-04-28T06:44:09,2

Underrated comment. Many are saying— including Trump's nephew— that his behavior mirrors that of his father's in his final years of life as he struggled with dementia. I believe his nephew revealed that point a few years ago as well.,Alarmed_Walk_198,2025-04-28T00:15:13,0
