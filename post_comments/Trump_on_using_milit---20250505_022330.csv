He fails to do a lot of what he says and when he does do things he hasn‚Äôt thought them through and reverses course - he‚Äôs incredibly weak,marshallaw215,2025-05-05T02:27:54,21
"Trump saud a metric ton of bullshit but for THIS alone...joking he could see taking Greenland, a nation alogned with an ally, by force, no fucking less, should be reason for his ass to be drug out of the White House in cuffs. Not that anything will happen and his supporters will all either lap it up or excuse it as a joke. The world eith pities, hates or fears us but NONE of it respects us...and the real sad part is we don't deserve it. That said...we can keep working and EARN some respect but...y'know..(.waves hand at, well...everything)",Rex-A-Vision,2025-05-05T02:46:13,13

"Maybe because he's promised Greenland to Peter Thiel, so he can build a libertarian utopia there. I would think climate change has something to do with it.",korkythecat333,2025-05-05T03:03:22,7
I get it now. Trump thinks he‚Äôs Tony Soprano.,damnthistrafficjam,2025-05-05T03:30:12,5

Obviously this is fucking insane. I do wonder how the world would react if he was truly dumb enough to legitimately take Greenland by force,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-05T04:30:16,1

Has Trump ever described any of the US states as cherished?  Does he think that It is tempting for Greenland or Canada to join the US considering how well he treats the people already part of the US.   He is just like your neighborhood pedophile trying to groom the neighborhood kids by offering them candy. He is so gross.,Working-Ad833,2025-05-05T07:23:08,1
"I don‚Äôt watch interviews with Trump for the sake of my own sanity, but I‚Äôve read many quotes from him saying that taking over Greenland is vital for our national security. Has anyone ever asked for and/or gotten any further details from him about _why_ it‚Äôs so important? Like, if it really was necessary to own it to protect ourselves, wouldn‚Äôt we have tried to acquire it during the Cold War? It just seems like one of those stupid things he says that doesn‚Äôt get any follow-up or pushback. And sure, he may be really trying to get it to pillage its resources, but the media should at least challenge the premise of his lie instead of just repeating it for him.",BookBison,2025-05-05T10:14:52,1
I like how he‚Äôs just pontificating invading sovereign nations and MAGAs are pretending like this insane shit is normal and they aren‚Äôt fascist pieces of garbage.,RetakePatriotism2025,2025-05-05T13:07:16,1
The funniest thing Trump could do in office is instate a draft to invade Greenland. Watch as literally 80% of young people in the country collectively tell him to go fuck himself.,BenevenstancianosHat,2025-05-05T03:03:28,8
"This dragging out of the White house better happens when he does it, because the other alternative is war. These people have no morals, so the only way they back off is if they are afraid that it would impact them personally. It's probably a good idea in general to keep the government afraid of the people, but when it's an authoritarian one then it becomes essential.  Are his political opponents, specifically at the state level, organizing against this? Because the only way to stop them from actually doing this *before* it starts a war is to make it perfectly clear to him and his handlers that invading an allied or neutral nation will result in a rebellion and a mutiny. The USA's legislature has shamefully abdicated its power to declare war to the president, so this will have to be stopped on the streets, in state capitals and in barracks. It's an existential threat anyway because if they are allowed to do this and all that happens are a few ineffectual protests while the army ""just follows orders"", the USA will end up at war and the fascists will have all the tools they need to suppress dissent and abolish democracy.",barryvm,2025-05-05T03:53:48,7

"Climate change is definitely a factor. We've (understandably) focused so much on the ramifications of rich people ignoring/denying it, we've kind have forgotten to also shout about what they're planning to do while paying attention to it.   Climate change from an average person's point of view: ""Oh no, the weather is getting erratic, food/water shortages are going to occur, and so many places are going to end up uninhabitable.""   Climate change from a rich person's point of view: ""Ooh look at all the new resources getting uncovered. Even though every single member of my family¬†has enough money to live a thousand lifetimes over comfortably, we want more. Time to prep the poors into going to war for us to get that wealth.""",LurksAroundHere,2025-05-05T05:03:18,9

"Greenland could call on Article 5 as a NATO member, meanwhile Denmark could call on Article 42(7) of the European Union which calls for EU members to provide aid when defending an attacked nation (and as long as Greenland isn't independent, it arguable is part of Denmark which in turn is part of the EU, even if Greenland itself isn't part of the EU).",Its-A-Spider,2025-05-05T07:22:43,2
