"Right? What a weird place to do this. shocker, shithole country was a shithole. 80% of communism's shtick is finding severely underdeveloped areas, tagging along for their industrialization, and then shitting the bed into an authoritarian regime pretending it did anything in the first place.  Like the implications that China did Tibet a favor lol. took them 30-some odd years to realize communism was keeping the place in perpetual poverty and introduce amazing concepts like ""you get first dibs on eating the crops you pick so you don't starve""... in the 80s.",Stoppableobject,2025-04-22T00:03:46,12
