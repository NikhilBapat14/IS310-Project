Trump is already setting the wheels in motion to steal the 2026 and 2028 elections. It's clear as day.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T12:54:29,25
"Pertinent details:  >The U.S. Election Assistance Commission has operated in relative anonymity since, but is now central to President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to overhaul elections. One of the commission’s boards will meet Thursday in North Carolina, the first commission-related meeting since the directives were announced. > >Among other things, Trump directed the agency to update the national voter registration form to add a proof of citizenship requirement. But whether the president can order an independent agency to act and whether the commission has the authority to do what Trump wants will likely be settled in court. > >... > >The four commissioners who lead the agency are nominated by the president based on recommendations from the majority and minority leaders in the U.S. House and Senate, then confirmed by the Senate. No political party can be represented by more than two commissioners. > >At various points, the agency has faced budget cuts, staffing shortages and gridlock caused by vacancies in the commissioner positions. But a consistent budget and a quorum among the commissioners since 2019 has led to increased stability, with election officials praising its efforts in recent years. > >... > >While Trump directed several federal agencies to act, two of the order’s major provisions were directed at the Election Assistance Commission. > >It was instructed to “take appropriate action” within 30 days to require documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form. The order outlines acceptable documents as a U.S. passport, a REAL-ID compliant driver’s license or official military ID that “indicates the applicant is a citizen,” or a government-issued photo ID accompanied by proof of citizenship. > >It also directed the commission to “take all appropriate action to cease” federal money for any state that fails to use the form that includes the proof-of-citizenship requirement, though a handful of states are exempt under federal law. Trump also wants the commission to revise standards for voting systems. > >Election experts have said the changes are unrealistic given the process outlined in federal law, which includes reviews by advisory groups and a period for public comment. The last major update to the voluntary guidelines for voting systems took years and was approved by the commission in 2021. > >“It’s practically impossible to demand that commissioners of the EAC create wholly new voting system guidelines based on highly questionable criteria within 180 days,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research. “It raises the question as to whether this was designed to create chaos since it cannot be practically and competently completed.” > >... > >On Thursday, the commission’s Standards Board begins its annual meeting in North Carolina, where it will hear from election officials from across the country, many of whom are likely to have questions about the commission’s role under Trump’s order. > >Earlier this month, the commission’s executive director sent a letter to state election officials summarizing the proof-of-citizenship requirement outlined in Trump’s order and asking how states would propose to implement it, if required, and what effect that would have on voter registration. > >Chairman Donald Palmer said the agency was following the law, which governs the way any proposed change to the federal form can be made. > >“That’s the process that we’ve done in the past, and that’s the process we did this time,” Palmer said. “In my mind, this is really to get information from the states.”  Thus far it looks like this independent bipartisan commission has been doing a reasonable job with their mandate, and unlike members of the upper and lower chamber have been able to be effective at improving the processes around elections. Following the executive orders would run counter to this, and would be a detriment to the effective democratic functioning of the nation.  edit: added clarifying word",Hrmbee,2025-04-23T12:57:26,9

"Ok at least this is happening 3 years before the next election and not within the last 6 months of an election.  So I’ll give them credit for this attempt, at least.  Inb4 still in the Courts 3 years from now",MariosBrother1,2025-04-23T13:25:14,0
