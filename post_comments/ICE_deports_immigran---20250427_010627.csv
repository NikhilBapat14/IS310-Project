"It‚Äôs so upsetting how they are targeting people who are following the rules and going to their scheduled check ins with immigration courts. This administration is so fucking lazy they can‚Äôt be bothered with finding the illegal immigrants hiding in the shadows who might actually be dangerous. No, instead they pick on desperate families hoping to gain asylum or legal status who are following all the rules they were told. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting but not surprising given this is all Stephen millers doing.",tresben,2025-04-27T02:11:03,34

"The guys who get screwed in these cases are the left behind fathers in the US. The government gave physical custody to the women without going through a family court. The government basically aided and abetted these women into committing international parental kidnapping, which is a felony.",_GD5_,2025-04-27T02:22:15,1

"It's not laziness. It's deliberate. The message they want to convey is not (as they pretend) ""if you are illegal we are going to get you"". It's ""we can get anyone, at any time, for whatever reason, and neither the law nor society will protect you"".  Their supporters are similar. They're not ""anti-illegal-immigration"". They're reactionaries, racists and outright fascists. They're angry and resentful against anyone they perceive as different from them and actively look for reasons to hurt them so they can feel better about themselves. They don't care about your legal status. Once you're ""othered"", for whatever reason, you become a legitimate target. They are reactionaries who want to construct a social hierarchy and one of the ways they want to do that is by making themselves the only people who have the ""privilege"" of feeling secure, i.e. by oppressing everyone else.  These immigrants who follow the rules are targeted not just because they are easy to hit but because the USA government wants to hurt them, wants to show their power over them, wants them gone. The rhetoric against illegal immigration is merely a facade around racism in the same way their anti-abortion stance is a facade around misogyny.",barryvm,2025-04-27T05:22:16,9
"This statement is SO true.  I know a couple that was undocumented on January 20.  They said they were really nervous about Trump.  Got a provisional green card a month later and declared Trump as the best thing ever.    When their provisional status gets yanked, I hope they at least enjoy the weather in El Salvador.",Bigfoot_Cain,2025-04-27T05:16:51,8
