"President Trump needs to follow the laws that are in place. When these activist judges stop him, he can immediately appeal to SCOTUS because of judicial overreach.",Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-25T09:26:35,245
"That’s because not every deportation needs judicial review, because there are laws, passed by Congress, that describe such situations. Anyone screaming on Reddit (or in front of some cameras in a Louisiana swamp) about “due process” is probably an idiot.",777_heavy,2025-04-25T08:50:55,189

"The numbers are staggering: in 1995, 1,400 immigrants were subject to nonjudicial removals, representing 3 percent of total deportations. By FY 2012 that number had sharply increased to 313,000 nonjudicial removals – an all-time high.  Wow, no judicial reviews for any of Obama’s deportations?   Is Van Hollen reading this? What were these to democrats, law abiding US citizens?  What hypocrites the left are!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T09:07:16,49

Oh how far the Dems have shifted.,AndForeverNow,2025-04-25T13:44:21,6
Do we know how long it would take to deport an illegal alien if they had to have a judicial review? I heard it would take 200 years just to deport the criminal illegal aliens alone if they all had to see a judge. But this is the point of liberals when it comes to illegal immigration. They adore illegal immigration. They want to try to slow it down by any means possible. Even though their own liberal presidents they voted for shipped out hundreds of thousands without a single complaint from them.,BossJackson222,2025-04-25T09:17:17,13

That's because it's allowed to deport people without what the left is saying they need now.,kaytin911,2025-04-25T18:47:43,-1
Why are you referring to him as 'President' in the title?   He's no longer a President and undeserving of the title.  It doesn't mention that anywhere in the article either.,Ironman650,2025-04-25T18:00:54,-9

"Well theres about 700 immigration judges and atleast 20 million illegal immigrants many of which we cant even find. Even just going by the 11-14 million knowns its still a ton. Each trial could take months, appeals could take years. Sure theyd be able to see multiple cases at once but realistically how many cases do you think they could take in a year. Like lets go on the low estimate for trial length taking 3 days, and we'll even round up to 150 trials per year per judge. Thats 105k trials per year or 105 years for rhe lowest 11 million estimate.   Obviously thats rediculous because illegal immigrants dont get the same due process that you or i would get, trial are only there for those who came legally such as overstaying visas or applied for asylum the correct legal way(by going to a port of entry, applying then being let in by an immigration official), if you are here legally all you get is a confirmation of identity and immigration status.    The whole arguement from the left that they deserve due process is based entirely on a lie.",ultrainstict,2025-04-25T09:48:02,13
"Or more! @ 680 but my point was more about Obama having zero judicial reviews, none, zilch! Zero!  If you are illegal, you are violating the law. Simple!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T09:13:09,-4
He can push for 6 months!,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-25T09:25:34,-6
Idk why your getting downvoted this is the main reason they're doing this. Not to stop it but to slow it to a crawl until they can seat another dem into power. Its also for them to point and go see see he said he was going to fix immigration but he didn't as if they weren't the ones setting up roadblocks.,Katzchen12,2025-04-25T18:49:26,25
