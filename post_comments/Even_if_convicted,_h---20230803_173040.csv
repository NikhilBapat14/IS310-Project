"Presidents only have the power to pardon federal crimes. Governors generally have the power to pardon state crimes. Trump is facing two federal indictments, and likely two state indictments.  Let's take the federal indictments first. If Trump is convicted of these crimes, a future Republican president can pardon him. In fact, it is extremely likely, if not inevitable a Trump pardon will happen the next time a Republican controls the White House. Ironically, a pardon would be iron clad if it came from a Republican president other than Trump. It's still an unresolved question whether a president can pardon himself. So if Trump is re-elected, he can try to pardon himself, but it may not stick. The sure fire bet is for another Republican to pardon him. That would be impossible to challenge.  Trump is also facing an indictment in New York state. Winning the presidency would not help Trump resolve this matter, because pardon power rests with the Governor of New York, currently a Democrat. It's conceivable a Republican could win the governorship in 2026 (they came within 5 points in 22, I think). But unlikely. So a New York conviction is the most likely to stick. However, the jailtime would be minimal - possibly even non-existent. The whole thing could get bumped down to a misdemeanor.  Lastly, Trump is likely to be indicted under Georgia state law. The Governor of Georgia does not have pardon power. Rather, the power is vested in a panel appointed by the governor. This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.  So there's your tally. A New York conviction will likely stick, but it won't be for much jail time. Federal convictions will last as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. And a Georgia conviction will probably be pardoned.",typicalredditer,2023-08-03T21:38:10,17
Kemp will pardon him in Georgia. New York is a problem for him. Federal will depend on the upcoming election. I feel that trump will lose to Biden if he has already been convicted somewhere. Then he will need to wait at least 4 years for a fed pardon. Spoiler; trump will die in prison after 2 or so years.,smedlap,2023-08-03T19:11:07,7

"It is quite sad to me,that the law can be circumvented, after the law has decided that the person on trial is guilty. However,Mr Trump,when speaking on January 6th, used one word,that I think could keep him out of jail. Mr Tump said the word ""peaceably "".

Georgia has an interesting element that folks are overlooking because they’re focused on pardons. They have a committee that handles pardons (not the governor) what’s overlooked is that this committee also review’s sentencing and can commute sentences. So even though trump can’t be pardoned until the time required after his sentence is served he’s s sentence can be reviewed and commuted almost immediately.,Tricky_Acanthaceae39,2023-11-13T01:30:00,1
"I do not think Trump will live long enough to be pardoned by a Republican president because there will not be any election of Republican presidents who will pardon criminal cronies as soon as they get into office.  The Republican Party is now adopting a policy that if they get a president into office that he will shield Republicans from prosecution for crimes and falsely prosecute Democrats.  There won’t be another Republican president for a generation. Nor can they be trusted with a majority in either chamber of the legislature.  Over the next couple of elections, they are going to get kicked out of power at the state level too. They are recklessly irresponsible criminals. We can’t allow them to be in charge of anything.",[deleted],2023-08-06T08:04:53,9
I consider Georgia a swing state now after the last couple of elections. But I agree with your overall synopsis. If a democrat wins there would be ample time for trump to rot in jail. 1 month in actual jail would please me greatly.,smedlap,2023-08-04T08:45:07,10

This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.   That's interesting.  I would have more faith in that than in a sole executive granting pardons and doling them out to political allies.  Kentucky's current Democratic governor is one of the highest polling ones in the country, which is funny because his Republican predecessor was one of the *lowest rated in the nation.*  If you don't know anything about former KY Governor Matt Bevin, then [this pic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECM_nuyWwAASYPs?format=jpg&name=large) tells you everything you need to know.  Anyway, pardons.  Bevin signed a bunch of controversial pardons on his way out the door (tons on his last day).  One pardon was for the brother of a Bevin fundraiser. That guy was pardoned for reckless homicide and is now *back* in prison after pretending to be a cop, invading someone's home, and murdering them.  I think I would prefer pardons reviewed by a committee with a process that is documented and can be reviewed.  As for Georgia, even if the governor is not the one handing down the pardons I could still see political pressure on the committee appointed by him happening.  That said, Brian Kemp doesn't seem like he's ready to go on a limb for Trump. He survived Trumps efforts to get Georgia Republicans to vote him out and I don't think he feels he owes Trump anything.",[deleted],2023-08-07T17:47:55,4

"As others have said, GA is hardly a red state. It has two democratic senators and went for Biden in the last election.  More importantly, though, is that GA law requires convicts to fully serve their sentences and remain free of any criminal entanglements for 5 years after completing their sentences before they are eligible to be considered for a pardon by the board.

"This would have to be resolved by the courts. And it would be ultimately a political decision by the Supreme Court.   My personal opinion is that someone in state prison when elected would stay in prison. The presidency is not a get out of jail free card. It sets up all kinds of conflicts of interest where the true reason for his election is not to serve the public, but to secure his personal freedom. Second, in a federalist system we have overlapping sovereign powers and the state’s police powers should not be overridden here. Third, to the extent this causes a “constitutional crisis” by hindering the president to his job because he’s incarcerated, the constitution offers two easy remedies. He could be declared incapacitated for the duration of his prison sentence under the 25th amendment. Or congress could remove him from office.",typicalredditer,2023-08-04T19:17:58,2

"It’s a matter of demographics. Support for the Democratic Party and its platform of policy is between 55 and 63% in the general electorate. That trend is not likely to decline over the next three elections.  This year and next year, Democrats will be successful in dismantling the gerrymandering that Republicans used to gain a razor thin majority in the House.   Dismantling their advantage in the Senate will take at least two or three elections, but once it is changed, it is not likely to be reversed for at least ten years, and maybe longer.  There are ten or eleven states that will flip over the next two or three elections. When Democrats are in charge of making the maps, they will make maps that are fair, and competitive, and therefore, not reversible in court.   Republicans will still have a chance, theoretically, of winning seats, but they won’t win. Because they oppose popular policies. They will become more and more attached to crackpot lies and gaslighting and doubling down, and people are sick of that.  Republicans will double down on culture wars. And it will get them kicked out of school boards, county boards, city councils, and statewide offices.  Republicans will continue to lose power on a nationwide scale over the next ten years, and then comes the census in 2030, which will reorder districts in a way that further reduces the number of Republican office holders.  This coming change is a realignment similar to the 1980s realignment. Democrats lost 1000 seats during that period. Now it is the Republicans turn.  Perhaps in 2032, there will be a rising star in the Republican Party who finds a way to win the presidency. Whoever it is, they will have to become more like a Democrat to win. Does that sound familiar? It should. It should sound like Bill Clinton in 1992.  History doesn’t actually repeat itself, but it does rhyme.  By the time there is any glimmer of hope for a Republican Party comeback, Trump will have been in jail for ten years. “Free Donald Trump” is not the rallying cry that is going to win any elections.

"The Supreme Court has a political question doctrine.  https://constitution.findlaw.com/article3/annotation12.html#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20has,able%20to%20address%20the%20issue.  This hypothetical case could be resolved without the intervention of the Supreme Court, but it involves very corrupt actions that could be challenged in court. The challenges, however, are unlikely to be heard or resolved by the court.  Let’s suppose that Trump is convicted for both federal cases (Conspiracy against rights, and espionage) and both state cases ( Falsifying Business Records, and Racketeering and Election Interference)  And despite that, and despite being in jail, he wins election to the presidency. Let me pause here and comment how extremely unlikely it is that Trump will be elected president while being in jail after being sentenced to decades in prison. It’s extremely unlikely.  If Trump were in jail and wins the presidency under this hypothetical scenario, he would likely be in federal prison, since he would probably be convicted of the Conspiracy Against Rights first. That’s my opinion, based upon the timing of the cases.  Since he would be in prison, he would be unable to be inaugurated and assume office. However, his Vice President Elect could be inaugurated and become the Vice President.   The term of the current president ends when his term ends, and if there is no president inaugurated to succeed him, then the newly inaugurated Vice President would become the Acting President.  Now here is where it gets really weird and really corrupt.   The Acting President could pardon Trump, and then he could be released from federal prison. However, Georgia could request that the Bureau of Prisons transfer him to the custody of the state of Georgia to begin his sentence there, but the Bureau of Prisons is run by the Justice Department,   SO, in order for the Acting President to pardon Trump and order his release, there would have to be an Attorney General to carry out the Acting President’s orders  BUT the Senate is unlikely to confirm an Attorney General whose first priority is to upend the rule of law and pardon a felon who was elected to the presidency   SO, the Acting President would have to appoint an Acting Attorney General who was the corrupt clown that he or she would have to be.  AND THEN, the corrupt Acting Attorney General would have to process the pardon for Trump and order the Bureau of Prisons to release Trump and NOT turn him over to Georgia.  At that time, Trump could be inaugurated as a *fugitive convict* president.  OR the newly elected Acting President could just avoid all of that, and refuse to pardon Trump, and then become the president.",[deleted],2023-08-06T07:45:31,1

"One of my hobbies is demographics.  Here is my breakdown of generational partisan affiliation. This is based on research (Pew, US Census, voter registration, election results)  Silent Generation: Long a reliable majority Republican group, is changing. The most conservative members of this group is the oldest, and the youngest members are very liberal (Think Nancy Pelosi or John Lennon)  I estimate that SG will be roughly 50/50 in the next election, and for the first time in 50 years they will not deliver a net advantage for Republicans next year.  Boomers: I estimate they are 60/40 in favor of Republicans. There is a subset of younger Boomers (60-66) who are far more conservative (70-30), but that 30 % is very liberal (many of the original punk rockers belong to this group. They invented the “Generation X” label.) The Boomers are the only group that will deliver a net advantage for Republicans next year.  Generation X: Some of the most famous Gen Xers are also the most right wing (Proud Boys, Oathkeepers, Musk), but Gen X are 60/40 in favor of Democrats. Because they are a smaller group than Boomers, they can’t entirely outvote the Boomers or even cancel them out, but they can narrow the Boomer advantage significantly.  Millennials: Overwhelmingly Democrats. 70/30. This is why the Republicans are going to be wiped out in the next election. The one-two punch from Gen X and the Millennials will outvote the Republican advantage among Boomers next year.  Gen Z: actually a small group of about ten million, they are 80/20 in favor of Democrats and they have voted in large numbers recently. They will make the victory next year deeper, possibly flipping state legislatures, like what happened in Virginia a couple weeks ago.  So, take heart and vote vote vote.",[deleted],2023-11-22T10:54:02,3
