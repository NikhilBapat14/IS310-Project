So he is admitting that he doesn’t know if he’ll abide by his oath of office? It’s not surprising considering that he broke his oath the first time.,MatrimCauthon95,2025-05-04T12:06:40,14
“Dictator on day one” explicitly means not upholding the  oath of the presidency or the constitution.  Promises kept.   Solution: Need to evict all enablers in Congress.,Lumpy-Loan-7350,2025-05-04T12:12:22,12
"It’s so clear from this interview trump has no god damn clue what is going in his administration. He’s the auto pen he accuses Biden of. Every answer is just “talk to the lawyers, talk to the DOJ”. No responsibility or logical argument cuz it’s clear he has no clue what the questions are even about.  We elected racist grandpa in mental decline whose head is filled with Fox News and right wing social media (social media which he has no capacity to even understand the algorithms or how it works). If anyone else was acting like this we’d be talking about a nursing home, not the White House",tresben,2025-05-04T12:18:38,10

"The constitution... idk man... sounds onerous.  Article 1:  Section 4... nah, feds got this  Section 8... my power now.  Tariffs!  Section 9... What's habeus corpus... we speak American in America.  Article 3:  This is preventing him from his 'mandate', so ignore it.  Amendments:  5th amendment... not sure.  1st amendment... can get you deported... or your broadcast license revoked  14th amendment... overruled by executive order  4th amendment... overruled by DoJ memo  22nd amendment... that's probably flexible  8th amendment... have fun in El Salvador  19th amendment... we're looking at it.  See SAVE Act.  The declaration of independence... it's about unity and love.   This dude is as backwards on what this country stands for as one can be.  He's got to go.  For realsies.

This coincides with Trump’s lawyers before SCOTUS arguing that he didn’t swear an oath to uphold it.  Trump now admitting that he isn’t loyal to the Constitution truly shows that we are in a post-Constitution America in MAGA’s mind.,arsveritas,2025-05-04T13:20:10,1

"It’s in his oath of office.  Or is he really deranged.  Only a few months ago   “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.”   So what does he think “Support and Defend” actually means ?",nobackup42,2025-05-05T07:22:30,1

"partial text:  WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was uncertain whether he was duty bound to uphold the Constitution, saying in a television interview aired Sunday that was a question better posed to his lawyers.  Trump was asked whether noncitizens are entitled to due process, which the Fifth Amendment requires before any person within the U.S. may “be deprived of life, liberty, or property.”  “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know,” Trump told interviewer Kristen Welker on NBC News program “Meet the Press.” While the Fifth Amendment “might say that,” Trump said compliance would require “a million or two million or three million trials” before undesirable immigrants could be removed.   “I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it,” Trump said.   “Don’t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?” Welker asked.  “I don’t know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said,” Trump said. ",Then_Journalist_317,2025-05-04T19:33:53,2
