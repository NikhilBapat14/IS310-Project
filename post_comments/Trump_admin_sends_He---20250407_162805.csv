Trump had to get his money from Bonesaudi Arabia.,BL0w1ToutY0A55,2025-04-07T16:38:21,1
Reflects Trumps nature. He cares more about money than honoring fallen troops.,RoughWestern9152,2025-04-07T16:43:36,1
I am surprised that this isn't getting the attention it should get but again the president decided to enacte Armageddon level tariffs on literally everyone. Including penguins and polar bears.,randomnighmare,2025-04-07T17:11:35,1
"It sounds bad, but as an officer that has been on funeral detail for many of these ceremonies and gone down on a knee and presented the flag to the next of kin, not having either one of those 2 very unserious individuals there would be for the best. Those are some of the most emotional experiences of my life - spouses or moms grabbing you, not letting you go and crying. It takes everything you‚Äôve got to remain professional.  Now by all means if the family wants VIPs there, it‚Äôs a ceremony to honor their loved one and that‚Äôs what matters most.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-07T16:49:50,1
Trump doesn‚Äôt give a crap about the military! He shows is constantly!,Then_Pirate_2460,2025-04-07T17:14:11,1
"Imagine your loved one serving in the military, dying, and then having to deal with that drunk idiot asshole at their ceremony. Only way it could have been worse would have been if Trump insisted on going. He would have made it all about him.",AmrokMC,2025-04-07T17:25:58,1

"We need to rail on this as much as possible, hammer home how he very openly does not care about our troops. With how much we supposedly worship our armed forces, that messaging should resonate.",LordSiravant,2025-04-07T17:53:08,1

It amazes me that he can‚Äôt even do the simplest presidential tasks. He has zero interest in good optics and being a leader.  Showing up to support the families and friends of 4 fallen servicemen is a political layup.,TasteTheBizkit,2025-04-07T19:54:02,1
