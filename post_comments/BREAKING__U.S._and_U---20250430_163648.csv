It isn't like we're going to drop American mine bosses and workers in there tomorrow.  Most work won't begin for well over a year.  And, it isn't like he could just drive around them and continue fighting, or just bomb the fuck out of them and claim Ukraine was the one who bombed them.

">Why? Putin believes he needs Ukraine for Russia to continue surviving  No, he doesn't.     Russia holds the world's largest proved natural gas reserves accounting for nearly 20% of the global total, the second largest gold reserves at roughly 13% of global supply, is the world's third-largest crude oil producer at 12% of global supply, has the world's sixth largest oil reserves and they accounted for 37% of 2022 global production of all industrial diamonds.   [Russia has nearly double the value of natural resources as that of the U.S.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090516/10-countries-most-natural-resources.asp)  Does anybody honestly believe that Russia ""needs"" to take over Ukraine or else Russia will crumble?  This is an ego war brought on by one person, and one person alone:   Vladimir Putin.  Do you want to know the *real* reason why Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine?  It was Western timidity and greed.  Every time that Putin used Russian military power to occupy the territory of another country, the West did nothing.  First in Georgia in 2008, then in Ukraine in 2014, in Syria in 2015, and finally in Ukraine for the second time in 2022.   Instead of showing NATO strength to Putin, the West basically rolled over and showed its belly.  Strongly worded condemnations from the United Nations mean exactly nothing to someone willing to use actual military force to achieve their goals.   Germany also had a large part to play in the invasion of Ukraine.  They were so in love with the cheap natural gas they were getting from Russia through the Nord Stream gas pipeline that they *still* went ahead with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline deal with Russia even after Putin annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula in 2014!   On the eve of the war in Ukraine, Russia provided a third of Germany’s oil, around half its coal imports, and more than half its gas.  And Germany did so despite the fact that the biggest threat to NATO in Europe is Russia.  So they were basically paying to arm their most dangerous enemy.  Oh, and let's not forget that Germany, and in fact most of NATO, weren't spending even the bare minimum on their own military defense as required for being a member of NATO.  As much as I don't like Trump's heavy handed approach to... well... EVERYTHING, he did manage to shock NATO into finally starting to invest in their *own* defense rather than counting on Uncle Sam (definitely not looking at you, Poland.  You guys are awesome.)   I do agree with your assessment that Vladimir Putin is attempting to recreate the glory days of the U.S.S.R. by means of military conquest.  He would like nothing more than to be seen by his Russian ~~citizens~~  subjects as the hero who returned Russia to the spotlight of world military power by conquering the countries that broke away from the U.S.S.R. in the early 1990s.  Instead, he's demonstrated that, once again, Russia is powerhouse on paper only.  Right now, Russia's military is being depleted.  It is estimated to have lost approximately 14,000 main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  They quickly burned through their good equipment and have been forced to start pulling WWII era equipment out of old U.S.S.R. storage areas where they've been sitting and rusting for decades, just in order to have *something* to keep fighting with.  But they're running out of tanks and APCs that are still in good enough shape to refurbish.  The rest are just too far gone to be used as anything but spare parts.  They're also having difficultly getting Russian men to sign up.   So between three years of war in Ukraine, worldwide sanctions, limited military production capabilities and a shortage of manpower, Russia either has to win Putin's three-day ""Special Military Operation"" in the next year or two or it will have no capability left to do so.  If the U.S. and NATO were to start supplying Ukraine more heavily with modern military equipment, I don't believe that Russia would have the staying power to keep going beyond 2026.  It comes down to simple attrition.  The U.S. and NATO can far surpass Russian and North Korean military supply production, both in quantity *and* in quality.",MildlyBemused,2025-04-30T20:39:54,40

">Because, if you read the press release, it's going to be American companies and Americans on the ground in Ukraine building the infrastructure to extract these rare earths.  You're taking years of work to develop and build, in a war zone. No American will be doing much work until the war is resolved.  >As soon as you put American lives and investment on the board, even Putin knows the game is up.  If he doesn't figure out a way to stop the war, he now knows that one errant missile and we have dead American non-combatants then there's zero reason for us not to backstop Ukraine to the hilt with as much military equipment as they can use.  That's not believable. At worst Putin will have to face Trump selling weapons to Ukraine at an inflated price. By the time that happens Russia will have made serious gains. Heck, they may even control some of the mines before a single American gets there.  >We've been giving Ukraine enough to defend themselves...with the scenario I described above, we have the ability to give them the equipment and logistics and intel for them to eject Russians from Ukraine entirely.  We have not given them enough to defend themselves if Russia is still there.   Plus, that's not how war works. The things need to be constant. You can't come in later, give a bunch of weapons and somehow win. The longer Russia is there, the longer they can dig in and the harder it is to remove them.

"Thanks for the compliment.  I do try to make my posts both informative and interesting for people, where I can.  To answer your first question, my response is, ""no"".  I haven't even seen the White House in person yet, much less visited the Oval Office itself.  Perhaps someday I'll be able to.  As far as your second question regarding Victor Belenko, that name definitely sounds familiar.  I'm going to guess he's Russian, or at least of Slavic descent?  But it feels like I heard it a long while ago.  How does Mr. Belenko tie in here?",MildlyBemused,2025-05-01T00:38:00,3
">You're taking years of work to develop and build, in a war zone. No American will be doing much work until the war is resolved.  I'm sure you're well versed on such things so we'll just have to take you at your word regarding your expertise on building infrastructure but the entire country isn't a war zone.  As for ""No American"", the very crux of the agreement is that American lives and American interests WILL be on the ground in Ukraine.  Otherwise, the agreement would have been described like ""as soon as hostilities in Ukraine cease"" and then the rest.  The agreement isn't preconditioned on a cessation of hostilities.  It's very value is to be the onus to stop hostilities.  >That's not believable. At worst Putin will have to face Trump selling weapons to Ukraine at an inflated price. By the time that happens Russia will have made serious gains. Heck, they may even control some of the mines before a single American gets there.  Hm.  Let's stay on this planet and discuss what's actually believable.  In your scenario, the Russians will now simply exert their will and gain all sorts of ground ahead of Americans arriving on the scene...as if, up to this point, they've not already been trying they're hardest?  As for mines, there aren't any.  Most rare earths collection comes from surface open pits.  That doesn't negate your assertion that Russia would move forward to claim the land those open pits would be on...but again, if they were capable of doing that, they would have done so already.  As for the weapons mention: the point of the minerals being declared to be part of American security interests means that weapons could be deployed to guard American installations that house Americans.  We already sell/give Ukraine all sorts of weapons but we currently place restrictions on how many and how they can be used.  With our lives and interests at stake, those restrictions could be removed.  >We have not given them enough to defend themselves if Russia is still there. Plus, that's not how war works. The things need to be constant. You can't come in later, give a bunch of weapons and somehow win. The longer Russia is there, the longer they can dig in and the harder it is to remove them.  Russia is 4 times Ukraine's population.  It is only by our aid and that of like minded countries that Ukraine has been able to effectively defend itself.  Where Russian forces are today are NOT their high water mark in this war.  Your definition of ""defend"" apparently means ""ejecting every Russian from the borders of pre-war Ukraine"" and I accept that your ""point"" needs that rather stilted definition in order to exist.  Ukraine still exists and they have pushed the Russians back since their initial invasion gains.  That's the true and actual definition of ""defend themselves"".  History would like a word with you about your assertion of ""things need to be constant"".  Once upon a time, Hitler's German armies stood on the coast of France and could see England across the Channel and could do so for nearly 4 years...before they couldn't anymore.  The Americans joined that war 2 years in progress, gave the English and Soviets a bunch of weapons and somehow won.  That situation wasn't constant and I'm surprised you weren't aware of that.  It was in all the papers for a time.    >Can you cite any examples where a trade deal somehow stopped a war? Some sort of proof that this is remotely feasible?  You're asking about how trade and war interact?  I thought that to most educated and informed people it was a well known fact that most wars are started over money, treasure and resources.  The Japanese war in the Pacific in 1941 was a direct result of the American and other allies embargos.  The German capitulation in WW1 was due entirely to the blockade and stoppage of their trade.  You want an example where one nuclear power allies with a nation being aggressed by another nuclear power to de-escalate a war between the latter two?  Does an example need to exist to establish the sense of such an arrangement?  How about the very existence of a nuclear United States backstopping NATO to deter the aggressions of the former Soviet Union?  Will that work for you?  This isn't that but the arrangement isn't far off.  You can't make that next step logic and need establish precedent?",Euroranger,2025-05-01T09:11:07,0
"You can now look him up  after your answer, yes, it would be way back in 1976. He took his Mig25 Jet 🛩️ and defected to Hokkaido, Japan, we inspected it from head to toe and returned it after that inspection, back to the Soviets. We took our time.  As I read your synopsis and the “crap” that Russia has militarily ( not everything) but “where they’re have been sitting and rusting for decades” reminded me of my talks with Victor. The Mig25 that we were so concerned about turned out to be a joke. We were shocked at how bad it was. The US Government (without concerns of China back then) knew that propping up Russia gave the USA reasons for continued military support and upgrades and although I support it, Russian was and is not nearly the formidable foe the MIC (Military Industrial Complex) portrayed them to be but it provided the needed increase in our military budget to constantly keep up with our enemies. Russia should not be taken lightly but your synopsis is correct, Putin carries a poker face.

"I remember reading about that!  The U.S. and its western allies were scared spitless of the Mig-25 after it demonstrated that it apparently had the capability to intercept our extremely fast and very top secret SR-71 Blackbird spy planes.  It threw the U.S. military into such an uproar that they immediately started designing the F-15 Strike Eagle to counter it.    It wasn't until Victor Belenko defected to Japan and they got the opportunity to closely study the Mig-25 that they realized it wasn't the super advanced fighter that they were assuming it was.  Although it *was* extremely fast and appeared to be an advanced design when viewed at a distance, it turned out to be a heavy, crudely built airplane that achieved its performance through sheer brute force.   The Mig-25 was simply one in a long line of future Soviet military designs that overpromised and underdelivered.  How did you get to know Victor Belenko personally?  You weren't actually one of the people who inspected his Mig, were you?",MildlyBemused,2025-05-01T01:36:13,4
"I wish to diminish any thought you may have of any importance, I like to maintain privacy but not for any reason of what I do. I will answer your question, no, I did not inspect the plane.  I arranged for Victor to speak to an audience of about 1800, much publicity surrounded the event, including Radio and Television, an appearance at a University campus and other events. During this time, mostly during driving, we spoke endlessly about America, Russia, politics. He told me when he was first allowed freedom in America and visited Supermarkets he told CIA/FBI/STATE what a great show they were putting on. He told me he was convinced that the supermarket was a set-up by our government to impress him when they advised him they are all this way, no set-up, he didn’t believe it and it took time he told me for him to believe it. As he visited other places, he marveled how the US Government was manipulating him because in Russia, food was scarce. It took a long time for him to believe it was real, food was plentiful in America. He was amazed that it was real and loved America for it, among other things.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-01T02:00:57,5
