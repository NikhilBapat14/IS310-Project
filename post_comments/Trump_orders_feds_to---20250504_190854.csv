..it’s been a museum since it closed in *1963*. The money it would cost to have it be operational again up to modern code…,According_To_Me,2025-05-04T19:28:21,1532
Wait ... what? Alcatraz closed decades ago ... for being too expensive for what it did. How is re-building the prison (which is effectively what it would take at this point ... I went there a couple years ago ... it's not exactly set up to house prisoners nowadays) going to make ANY financial sense to do?,DonkeyMilker69,2025-05-04T22:28:49,354

"""REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!"" the president said.

They need to build US versions of CECOT. The salt water in the air will corrode the steel just like back in the 60s. Not to mention the ~~millions~~ billions in repairs it would need.

"It would be around $250M, at least. Typical prison costs $250K per bed. If they expanded it from 360 (original size) to 400, that’s $100M. Just for the cell block. Add in the security, demo costs, infrastructure (water mains from the mainland) and you are easily tacking on another $150M. The prison would basically need to be demolished and rebuilt to code.

It's a waste of money regardless. Alcatraz was closed originally because it was so expensive to run in comparison to land based prisons. I'd rather he build a prison in continental US and put a moat around it than this. It'll probably be cheaper.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-04T20:06:48,371
