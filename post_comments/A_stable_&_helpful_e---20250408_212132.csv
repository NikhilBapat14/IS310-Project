"Here’s the full 40-minutes on YouTube: [Kamala Harris reveals economic plan in Pittsburgh I Full Speech I MSNBC - Sept 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-zTQl83nw). She starts @ 1:50 and ends @ 41:28.",biospheric,2025-04-08T21:21:54,9
"I wish she was elected, but she wasn’t.  Driving the car while looking into rear view mirror will get us nowhere.  Unless you know some rule where if we can get 10% of Trump voters to change their votes she gets to take over.",phxees,2025-04-08T22:11:07,15
"I love Kamala, but this isn’t it. She didn’t deliver the vision in a way we all can relate to. She just read out policies…",Strict-Relief-8434,2025-04-08T21:32:46,-18
"I'm reaching back to bring these economic policies into the present. Her policies & vibes are still relevant. She might not be the messenger next time, but I feel it's important to remind (or introduce to) people what sane Dem policies look/sound like, especially compared to the sh\*tshow of Trump & Associates, Inc.",biospheric,2025-04-09T03:39:18,4
"Does it matter? Like I agree with you, there were things she could have done better, but it will never not blow my mind that we had the choice between a normal person and a fucking vengeful lunatic and we picked the lunatic.  We take good leaders for granted, often are hard on them/grade them on an impossible curve, and then wonder why we ended up with criminal frat bros in power. History will look very kindly on Biden/Harris, and it hurts to see old interviews of them literally a mere months ago and be reminded on how we used to be better than this. Yeah, she read off policies. Those policies would be nice right about now.",cpatkyanks24,2025-04-08T21:42:18,24

"We need to draw up a new contract for Americans.  If you have or are contributing you will be compensated fairly for your labor.  If you can’t work we’ll help you next.  If you won’t work, we’ll work with you next.",phxees,2025-04-09T06:33:28,1
"I love your passion. And I agree with literally everything you said.   Unfortunately, I think us Democrats need to have a come to “Jesus” moment. We’re playing by the rules and they just lit a flamethrower to the rulebook. I wish we lived in reality where being a straightforward, rational politician, conveying good policies actually meant something. But we don’t live in that world.  We need to be looking forward right now. How do we take advantage of the situation and not make the same mistakes . How do we play by the new set of rules and implement the good policies we know we will bring prosperity to Americans.",Strict-Relief-8434,2025-04-08T22:19:01,-4
"It’s so dependent on what the mood of the country is I think too. Donald Trump won twice as a challenger where he whined about how unfair and terrible everything was and basically raging at the status quo, but he got his ass kicked as an incumbent by a country that was tired of chaos. In 2020, the country WANTED the straightforward, rational politician.   It’s very possible that Dems can’t and shouldn’t run the same type of playbook in 2028 as 2020, because they are much more unpopular as a party than they were then and are in need of a vibe change as is. I still think being rational and common sense is a positive, but the broader electorate does not see the Democratic Party on the whole as “common sense” anymore. Which seems crazy to me personally, but I think THAT’S the reality Dem politicians need to accept and go about changing. Whether that’s messaging, leadership, candidates, or all of the above. Until we have that credibility with voters again that we used to, it’s going to be hard to win elections in anything other than the most favorable, anti-Republican environments.   Like Biden did not run some incredible campaign in 2020 by any means. He was just a generic white guy with universal name ID and was associated with a popular Democratic administration the country was nostalgic for and that was enough.",cpatkyanks24,2025-04-08T22:46:21,2
