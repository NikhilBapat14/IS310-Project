"We all know the answer, he's incompetent and doesn't care.",Kroe,2025-05-08T17:17:58,29
"They're all brown people so he doesn't give a fuck.  Meanwhile, be grateful that he's not involved. They're both nuclear powers.",AINonsense,2025-05-08T17:26:22,26
"After how Trump ""intervene"" in Ukraine, I think its better for India/Pakistan and the world for Trump to stay out as much as possible in international conflict...  Trump can not be trusted and he's a moron. The worst combination.  Europe should step in and fill America's void and lead the free world.",wizgset27,2025-05-08T17:21:26,11
"I doubt he could even find either country on a map, even if it was labeled",Ftheyankeei,2025-05-08T17:37:07,6
It's probably because he has no idea about what's going on anywhere at all.,CaptainMurphy1908,2025-05-08T17:20:50,5
Because Modi hasn't sent him a sweetly worded letter with a check inside it yet.,Infamous-Sky-1874,2025-05-08T17:19:09,6

"Why would anyone want Trump involved?  He has no idea what is going on, wouldn't bother to learn, and the same goes for the fools running the administration for him.",pinetreesgreen,2025-05-08T19:13:44,3
"Trump isn't doing anything because they aren't white, and they aren't non-whites in his yard.",Spam_Hand,2025-05-08T17:21:28,5
"1) I'd be mildly surprised if he could point to Pakistan, or even India, on a map.  2) There's no way he can grift it for his own personal benefit.  3) ""I don't know.""  4) His Evangelical Christo-Fascist handlers probably actually *relish* the idea of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan.  5) It's Thursday.",XennialBoomBoom,2025-05-08T18:48:28,2

Trump is incompetent and doesn’t understand the issues or the consequences. ,Maximum_District1959,2025-05-08T19:37:41,2

He doesn’t care.,Doublebosco,2025-05-08T17:21:20,1
Doesn’t care about either country. He probably wants to see how it plays out.,Gold_Honeydew_8530,2025-05-08T17:22:05,1
Because he's bad at closing deals. Unless they're bad deals.,YoungestDonkey,2025-05-08T17:30:03,1
Because it never would have happened on his watch.,AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-08T17:44:16,1

The wealthy that do business in India  are going to nudge him soon if it threatens profits.,VladtheInhaler999,2025-05-08T18:06:36,1
No one has showed him where they are on the map yet.,windwatcher01,2025-05-08T18:25:59,1
Because he doesn't come up with policies and grifters give him notes based on his interests and their own interests. They don't react to new events only working towards their own ends. He's an orange ornament more than a leader.,potchippy,2025-05-08T18:26:40,1
because if he did it will get worse and a nuclear war will happen,saiyanscaris,2025-05-08T18:54:51,1

But the IMF approves loan of 1.8 billion dollars to Pakistan yesterday. And the same money will go to the USA in the name of selling weapons! So who’s the real sponsor of the terrorism ?,Beginning-Forever597,2025-05-09T20:08:54,1

It been going on for over 75 years. Why get involved. It’s Britain problem.,That-Resort2078,2025-05-08T18:15:36,-2
"Because he's too busy taking over the First Lady duties such as redecorating the White House in the most tacky manner possible, to make it look as much like Mar a lagoon as possible, because she refuses to do First Lady, also.",Watchhistory,2025-05-08T17:46:47,9
Aged well.,Past_Idea,2025-05-10T08:52:44,2
