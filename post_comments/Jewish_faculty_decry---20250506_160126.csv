Because it was never about antisemitism. It was always about whether you're anti Israel militarism and the bloodthirsty government or not.   If they cared about antisemitism then they'd go after the KKK and American Nazi Party. But they don't give a fuck if you hate Jews as long as you're white and like Israel.,Mattractive,2025-05-06T17:24:19,18
well the panel lived up to its name.,TintedApostle,2025-05-06T16:03:19,9
"This is disturbing for sure, but it shouldn’t be surprising to anyone at this point. NO ONE, not even the Republicans leading these attacks on pro-Palestinian sentiment, believes that this is about fighting antisemitism.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T16:10:33,9
">The university, the memo notes, is not among those facing congressional investigations, which are instead **focused on pro-Palestinian speech**.  This is ultimately what it comes down to. Punishing speech politicians don’t like.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-06T16:11:29,8
"Watch this selective politically convenient alliance between ""Jews"" and Christian nationalists grow more toxic as the republicans who are pushing it get ahead of themselves.",Seasonal_Evergreen,2025-05-06T16:30:35,5
Sadly just like all the other single issue voters... Trump and his admin don't give a shit about you. Here's a short list of single issue voters that got suckered into thinking he cared about them:  Christian & anti abortion folks.  2A folks.  Pro Israel.   Pro Palastine.  Unions.  Auto workers.   Cubans & conservative Latins.  He does not give a shit about your beliefs. He just wanted your vote and your money. He's done with you.,williamgman,2025-05-06T19:17:03,2
Jews in America overwhelmingly voted for Harris and still get blamed for everything.,Thumbkeeper,2025-05-07T12:24:07,1
But which branch of Christianity??? There are so many in the US!!!,[deleted],2025-05-06T18:53:45,0
"The “calls for Jews to covert to Christianity” headline is more than a little sensationalist; the Great Commission of Christ, to go into all the world and preach the Gospel, is hardly threatening, especially when done correctly through generosity and love. My parents lived and worked in Israel and the West Bank for a Christian organization and they were forbidden to proselytize to Israeli’s. If I recall, the Latter-Day-Saint church  had to come to some agreement with Israel’s government to not go door-to-door talking about Joseph Smith.",BornInBigD,2025-05-06T21:22:32,-2
There is only one for MAGA: Evangelicals. But even then... He got their money and their votes. Suckers.,williamgman,2025-05-06T19:18:35,1
