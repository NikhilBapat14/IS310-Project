They keep voting in favor of increasing the gas tax on themselves to fight global warming. Newsom is also shutting down refineries.   But I’m sure they’ll blame Trump,Sheriff_Hopper,2025-05-06T17:30:55,105

"And this is seperate from the new regulations from november that just raised gas prices by 60c and are set to continue to raise prices by 150c by 2035.  We are going to have $10 gas in california.  State has litterally everything going for it, can grow every food, can support nearly every industry but at every opportunity they somehow make it worse.",ultrainstict,2025-05-06T22:32:53,17
"Oh boy, California’s gonna be feeling this one pretty hard. Nearly $10 a gallon at the fuel pumps are going to be what kills the state’s economy.   Newsome better get his head in the game real quick before California collapses, because this WILL be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. The cannon has been loaded and the fuse is burning.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-06T16:55:22,35
That’s my cue to leave California. What I’m paid is not enough to put up with this or even buy an EV.,SouthernNumismatist,2025-05-06T18:38:58,22
"I keep wondering when they hit the breaking point in California. At some point, these basic cost of living increases will break the local economy of that state such that it will create a more serious crisis.",deadzip10,2025-05-07T08:04:45,4

"The ~~$350~~ ~~$500~~ $750 gas bill and counting.  Does the planet still need saving after this? They keep saving the planet every year but yet the planet always still needs saving for some reason.  >!Do you mean heating or transportation?!<  >!First one, then the other.!<",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-06T17:03:05,13

There are plenty of conservatives in California. Just overwhelmed by Los Angeles and San Francisco numbers. Hence Jefferson.,Blarghnog,2025-05-06T23:22:40,10
