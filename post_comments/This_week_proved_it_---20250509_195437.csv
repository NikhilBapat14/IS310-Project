"Because his ""plan"" has nothing to do with antisemitism and *everything* to do with fascism.",BukkitCrab,2025-05-09T20:33:14,24

"It is planned, so it will be a continue unrest in US; and he will continue his power grab.   Stirring unrest   Claiming he needs more power as national emergency   Stir more unrest",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-09T19:58:37,4
The overwhelming majority of America and the world understands that criticism of the ongoing genocide in Gaza is not antisemitism.,Marxian_factotum,2025-05-09T21:13:14,6
"Wait. Are you telling me that Nazis are bad at stopping antisemitism?   We live in a bonkers world where Israel's government has found safer harbor in the eyes of the ""hitler wasn't so bad crowd"" than with the traditionally diversity-loving eyes of the left.",E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-09T23:35:05,2

The stupidest thing anyone who cares about antisemitism can do is make 'antisemitism' appear to be an empty worthless and utterly meaningless act of partisan mudraking.   But no one cares what I have to say so go ahead and let me know how that works out in the long run.,Lord0fHats,2025-05-09T20:47:48,2

"Interesting article. A highlight:  ""How exactly might cutting funding into research that could improve the lives of mothers and children help Jews? And how does cutting funding into research that could improve the lives of mothers and children, and saying that the funding is being cut for the benefit of Jewish students, keep Jews safer? This is to say nothing of the Jewish researchers whose funding will be caught up in these cuts, or the Jewish patients who would surely benefit from such studies.  Of course, these moves do exactly what the Trump administration intended: use antisemitism as a pretext to attack institutions of higher education.""",oatchick,2025-05-09T23:05:01,0
"It is ludicrous that the party that marched with tiki torches while chanting ""the Jews Will Not Replace Us"" as many in the administration hung their heads in shame when the Republican president claimed there were very good people on both sides, the party that courted anti Semites to join its base is suddenly declaring they are interested in stopping anti Semitism.   It is heinous that people use the very real danger of anti Semitism as a bludgeon to turn other members of marginalized communities into scapegoats. That is chilling -  using the history of the Holocaust to create scapegoats and rile up citizens against them...",SicilyMalta,2025-05-10T06:36:33,0
"Schools are finally expelling students who commit anti-Semitic acts.  Foreign students who commit anti-Semitic acts are being deported.  These are good measures.  The reason it's slow is because Dems and liberal schools have let anti-Semitism fester so far and so deep, it will take a lot to remove it.",WorkerClass,2025-05-09T22:31:07,-6
"Yes, Republicans are using a pretense of worrying about anti semitism as a bludgeon to turn other people into scapegoats.    Terrifying.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-10T06:46:49,0
"The Trump Administration has employed multiple antisemites and made antisemitic conspiracy theories such as ths Replacement Theory part of their platform. They do not give a fuck about antisemitism. Mahdawi and Ozturk have already been relessed because the cases against them are bs.   Protesting genocide ≠ antisemitism.  Writing an op-ed suggesting your university divest from Israel ≠ antisemitism Collaborating with the Canary Mission and conflating antizionism with antisemitism is not going to do anything about antisemitism. How many Dems or left-wingers shot up synagogues, mosques, grocery stores, Walmarts, etc. motivated by antisemitic conspiracies vs people on the right?  How many people on the left or in the Democratic camp have ties to hate groups compared to people on the right? Be for real.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-09T22:45:03,8
