They really should.  It'll help buyers make better decisions.,cathbadh,2025-04-29T19:03:06,64
"That would be too transparent. Now they can pad the profit margin of their cheap Chinese shit and claim tariffs. If something goes from $2 to $6 they hope we'll just think tariffs. If it was $2 and they announce tariffs are $2.90, we'll know their $6 is BS",rob_s_458,2025-04-29T13:38:11,72
  I use [Keepa](https://keepa.com/#!) to help keep track of price changes on Amazon.   It's a great extension and if you order from there even once a month I suggest you download it.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-29T14:30:01,16
I don't care either way. People buy less plastic shit they don't need from China is for the better.,ManufacturerFine2454,2025-04-29T11:46:09,35
I've been looking all morning and haven't seen a single 'tariff' tag on anything.,Daniel_Day_Hubris,2025-04-29T14:32:11,2
Good! Anybody with half a brain could see this was politically motivated.,MFN_blessthefall,2025-05-03T08:09:08,1
"Tariffs have been in place for quite some time, including increases from the Biden admin. Why is it only relevant to display now?",RandolphE6,2025-04-29T16:37:25,-11
Is there really a reason they should?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T11:32:00,-25
That's ultimately what they're against. It's plausible deniability when you go on Amazon and buy a WEIRUOFDE blanket. You suspect it's Chinese crap but you don't have definitive proof.  Add a tariff breakdown and you will clearly see just how much useless Chinese junk is peddled on Amazon.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-03T01:21:25,2
"I’ll have to check this out. Does it track price changes of items *after* you add them to a list, or can it pull price history from items you are currently looking at?",whitepageskardashian,2025-04-29T17:10:01,0
Because Trump made a massive deal out of them and placed a 145% tariff on China? How do you not understand why it's relevant now?,MadClothes,2025-04-29T19:24:53,21
"Yes.   Transparency. If you’re going to apply a price hike of products, but not tell me what the price hike is and why, then I don’t trust you’re being truthful. Just like the other comment says. If the price goes from 2 to 6 dollars, but the tariff only increased it by 1$ then they make 3$ profit and blame it on the administration.   Easily allows companies like Amazon to gauge consumers and take no blame at all. And people are dumb enough to believe it.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-29T14:06:13,54
"It’s a line graph that will show price change history for the entire history an item has been on Amazon (since the extension was created)  So you can add something to your cart and then if/when you wanna buy it, view that price history and see if you’re paying more/less/same.   It won’t show the history in your cart though. You’ll have to click on the item and go to the items main page to see the graph.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-29T17:50:15,2
"So according to you, it's only relevant when Trump does it. Why don't you advocate for this on literally every item sold in existence? If your stance is it should only be displayed after it crosses some arbitrary threshold, why don't you advocate for anything over that threshold? How do you not understand how stupid your argument is?",RandolphE6,2025-04-29T19:36:18,-13
"So a business should explain every little price hike. From increase in employees salary, increase in taxes etc...   There  is no legal obligation to do that.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T16:17:52,-11
"Either the sub us inundated with lefty bots and lurkers, or our fellow conservatives are dangerously ill-informed on how tariffs work and are overly frightened. We've become weak. That is why you're downvoted.",MikeyPh,2025-04-30T04:40:17,4
"No, but I’d find myself having a lot more brand loyalty if a company was more transparent about their full process. Like where they acquire resources, manufacture, and how they price.   There’s already companies that currently explain why prices have increased,",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-30T06:20:48,3
Do you hold every company to that standard or only Amazon?   How about EVERY car manufacturer? Every Computer maker? Pretty much everything made?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T09:54:46,0
"I mean it’s ultimately the companies decision. But if companies began doing it more often, I would feel much more confident purchasing products from them.   The reason companies don’t is because they have tons of shady business practices.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-30T10:12:47,3
"Take a page from the Muslims in Dearborn MI.  Back in the 90's they would protest outside of businesses until the business started posting dual language, arabic and english. All we can do in any situation where the business is not doing something we think is good. Push them to change. Don't push the government, it shouldn't be their problem.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T10:54:35,1
"Are you lost or something? You seem lost. From my perspective it seems like you’re fighting for companies ability to continue to fuck over the American people.   I did not ever claim the government should enact a law that makes transparency required.   This tweet does not state anything about a law, or government.   This tweet states there was a discussion about providing more transparency on certain products, which Amazon decided it will not do.   I have stated that I believe transparency would increase my likelihood of buying a product from a company and being a bit more loyal if I know a few more things about it. I’d like to know why an item doubled in price, and specifically. Is it to improve employee salary? Is it to make more money to move manufacturing to a country that uses less inhumane practices of employment? Or is it to boost profits for the share holders? Too often companies increase price of things during times of instability in world events like COVID, and these tariffs, and inflation. Yet when things like tariffs go away, the prices never decrease. If a company was up front about tariffs being the reason they needed to increase their price, and all of the sudden the tariff dropped as well as their price, wouldn’t you trust that company more and be more confident in buying from them?   How could you disagree with that?",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-30T11:11:42,3
"No I am not lost, I look at everything with a critical, logical eye and some common sense.  Would I like to have the cost associated with tariffs? Yes but it is not something I want to spend my time protesting or complaining about because it wont make a difference other than to see what products might be lower or higher based on it.  There are 1000's of things that affect costs everyday for products. Gas prices to supply and demand to minimum wage to shipping to a whole lot of things. Most of us barely read the ingredients on a cereal box let alone the information that could affect the price of a product one way or the other.  Why only certain products? Cars parts are made all over the world, why not also point out they don't show the cost of Tariffs. Electronics are made almost exclusively outside the US, why not point them out as well.  To focus on just Amazon show more that there is an agenda than actually caring about what the cost is for tariffs on a product.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T11:20:29,1
"You still seem lost.   I explicitly answered your previous question when you asked if I felt it was necessary to apply it to all products. I’m not referring just to Amazon. So let’s clear that up… again.   Sure those things fluctuate, but just because gas and oil goes up a certain month, doesn’t mean a large number of products prices are increasing that same amount to compensate. Prices on mostly every product out there is not fluctuated on those 1000s of “things” you are claiming daily.   It’s almost as if you’re not even reading my response and just so closed minded and willing to get fucked by corporations without knowing why.   I’m not asking you to go picket fence protesting. I’m going to guess you’re against government transparency of spending as well because “it’s too difficult to measure” or some dumb ass reason like that.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-30T11:29:50,3
"I never said it was too difficult to measure. And saying ""some dumb ass reason"" usually means you are trying to insult me without being direct about it.  I am tired of going in circles as well.  Bless Your Heart.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T11:36:53,1
"I mean you haven’t even made a solid point as to why you disagree with transparency. So you’ve really contributed nothing to the conversation. You’ve blatantly ignored statements I’ve made. And haven’t made your argument clear at all. I genuinely don’t understand your motive, or reasoning behind a single comment you’ve made.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-30T11:56:23,4
