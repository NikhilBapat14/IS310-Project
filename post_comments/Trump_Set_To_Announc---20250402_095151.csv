"This is going to be a f\*cking disaster.  All these extra taxes represent money not going into 401k funds, not available to pay for loans on homes, big ticket items (washers, dryers, ranges, refrigerators for said homes...and there is only one domestic washer/dryer mfg in the USA left) new car sales...  It's going to tank the economy in the short to mid term.",GG1817,2025-04-02T10:14:12,41
"The economists on MSNBC divided Idiot Trump's outrageous tariff revenue claim by US families and came up with a cost of $5,000 per year per family.   I guess this is the ""little disturbance"" as billionaires see it.",YallerDawg,2025-04-02T10:03:44,9

"Probably the biggest tax hike EVER.   If you hear somebody say ""Trump tariffs"", politely let them know that ""Trump tax hike"" is a more accurate description. And if they seem like they'd like to be enlightened further, bring up Trump's campaign promise to end inflation on ""Day One"".   It's American consumers who pay these tariffs ‚Äì not the exporting counties. Any legit economist or importer knows this.   Be relentless with such reminders ‚Äì MAGA and its broligarch billionaires are not shy about spreading disinformation 24/7.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-02T10:19:58,5

"The rich vs. The rest of us. I swear we had this conversation back in November when we warned the rest of the country, and they all denied it and said they were going to own the libs.

Trump and Musk both made their billions sucking off the public tit. Wisconsinites made a good choice yesterday. Tired of the chaos, don't vote Republican.

All this tells me is these companies are having a harder time increasing their year over year increase in profits and so they needed someone to trick the US into paying more because we would not do it normally.,Aaneata,2025-04-02T17:08:22,1

"My car was starting to do that thing where shit starts to go wrong. I just had the timing chains fixed and it was showing signs that the pistons were next. We were going to fix that, too, but with the tariffs looming, I was worried something else would go sideways and it would need to be replaced, so I traded it in for a new car two weeks ago. Got a great deal and am glad I did it now and didn't wait. I really didn't want a car payment yet, but I also didn't want to overpay for a car, either.",BustAMove_13,2025-04-02T10:54:41,17
A lot of people cut all of the things on your list thanks to rampant inflation. This straw is going to break a lot of backs.,BetterBiscuits,2025-04-02T11:16:40,3
"Trump doesn't give AF about economic nationalism.  He is currently surrounding himself with crypto and other tech geeks, not the CEOs of Honeywell, GM, or Kitchen Aide.   I think in his mind it will all sort itself out in 2 - 3 years and he will be praised as a genius.",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T15:23:01,1

"What is this number based on, though?  I mean, if the average family continues to shop as usual, then they would spend an extra $5K per year?  Or, was this figure derived from paring down to only the essentials?",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T15:28:59,1
