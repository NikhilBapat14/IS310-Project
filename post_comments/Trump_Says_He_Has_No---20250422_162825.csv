"Good... can he stop pressuring him to raise rates?   The President is pressuring Powell to change rates and inflate the dollar so that the double and triple digit taxes/tariffs on imports the president created don't hurt American consumers. That's nuts. There is no emergency. He can just lower the tariffs to fix the problem. Furthermore, changing rates to negate the tariffs also negates the entire point of the tariffs which was to bring jobs back!  This is why Powell is saying no. He doesn't work for the stock market. He knows this is an inflation bomb for the real economy and knows that the real problem in the stock market is the Presidents erratic impositions of astronomical taxes. The problem is one the president made and can fix. But he's refusing to do so and presenting it as if Powell is making all the decisions.  The President raised you taxes and says Powell can make it better. Actually the President can make it better by getting rid of the taxes. But he's not, so the country's economy is going to be devasted.",shatterdaymorn,2025-04-22T16:33:59,4
"*From Bloomberg News reporter Stephanie Lai:*  President Donald Trump said he had no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell despite his frustration with the central bank not moving more quickly to slash interest rates.  “Never did,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “The press runs away with things. No, I have no intention of firing him. I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.”  [You can read more here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/trump-says-he-has-no-intention-of-firing-fed-chief-powell)",bloomberg,2025-04-22T16:30:15,3

"the issue with being an agent of chaos who regularly lies and has a long history of firing people right after saying you won't....  ... is that your word is worthless.  this might=right + magical thinking is just crashing into reality in a terrible way for the US economy.    Although it is actually nice to be upset about the economy for a few minutes, its a nice reprieve from being upset about the erosion of the rule of law.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-22T16:35:34,1

"Trump may have finally, finally, *f i n a l l y* figured out that one of the very few ways of getting his cabinet, Congressional Republicans and maybe even MAGA to turn on him is to violate one of the most basic rules of US politics: ***Don't. Touch. The Fucking. Money.***  Of course, this is not the first time he's learned that lesson (see: the reciprocal tariff backflip).

"What's important isn't the 'can't' - this is Trump, that's NEVER important to him.
