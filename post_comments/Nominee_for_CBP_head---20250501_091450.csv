"The posted article buries the lede in regards to his [rape threats towards a former border patrol agent](https://dailyboulder.com/i-was-just-challenging-her-creative-imagination-trump-nominee-offers-bonkers-excuse-for-rape-threat-on-gov-employee/)  >The former agent, who had previously accused Scott of fostering a toxic culture and even covering up a brutal killing, had also revealed she was raped during her time at the Border Patrol Academy.  > Scott’s response to her? A tweet that read: “Lean back, close your eyes, and just enjoy the show.”  >...  >The senator also questioned Scott’s membership in a Facebook group that featured disturbing content—racist jokes, sexual posts, and even mockery of the deaths of migrants in U.S. custody. The group reportedly included crude comments about a photo of a father and child found face down in a river, suggesting the tragedy was staged.",sad_cosmic_joke,2025-05-01T09:18:15,2

This administration has consistently named the most unqualified people to their posts.  Which only hires the best people. /s,thieh,2025-05-01T09:25:55,1
All of these seems like the qualifications the administration has been looking for.,thieh,2025-05-01T09:24:21,2
