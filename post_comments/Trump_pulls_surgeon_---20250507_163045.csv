"Can we please remember that this woman became known because she locked herself to the Twitter office door when they suspended her account. These are our political influencers, folks.",rubizza,2025-05-07T16:35:01,54
"Jesus, we're fucked. His first term, Trump was stupid, but he had guys like Mattis and Kelly to rein him in. This term, he's both stupid and senile, and he has people like Loomer and Hegseth egging him on.",alleyoopoop,2025-05-07T16:51:15,15

"Loomer is in a petty cat fight with Bobby brainworm fangirl influencers so she's out for blood to take the Maha moms down a notch.Â  Rats eating rats, folks.",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-07T16:39:12,8
"Yeah, and theyâ€™ve replaced her with an unlicensed physician. Never was, and has no ability to legally practice medicine as she never did a residency",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T16:56:35,6
Makes you wonder why Laura Loomer of all people has such a strong influence over Trump. Wonder why that could be? Itâ€™s almost like all those rumors about Loomer sleeping with Trump during the campaign might be a little more than just rumorsâ€¦?  I just threw up in my mouth while typing that. Talk about two completely repulsive human beings. Truly disgusting to even think about. So gross.,Dexx009,2025-05-07T16:56:26,9

"And it was one of two double doors and all she did was cuff herself to one single door handle, and literally everyone just walked in and out like she wasn't there.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-07T16:57:56,31
Whatâ€™s even more insane: somehow - some way - Laura fucking Loomer was the person put an end to that disastrous pick?  Laura Loomer was the voice of reason in this White House decision.  JFC. The brain rot and voluntary sacrifice of integrity in the GOP congressional ranks is really setting a historical precedent. There is no way these folks wouldnâ€™t enable a repeat of a holocaust/holodomor/cultural revolution/pol pot year 0 type of event given half the chance.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-07T17:32:27,7
"I remember her best for the time she accused Antifa or whoever of slashing her tires because she got a flat, then posted pictures of her Jeep with the most dry-rotted, been out in the sun for 15 years, crispy, treadless, brittle tires known to man. Obvs she got extremely roasted. I miss the good old days of Twitter lol",cardueline,2025-05-07T19:58:50,3

"Worse, this new lady has made consistent outrageous claims such as diseases are entirely a metallic issue and other nonsense. She is a health influencer with no medical background. She did go to a medical school then flunked out of residency.",spookyjibe,2025-05-07T20:53:32,6
When I found out Laura Loomer was younger than me I thought I was being pranked.,strawberrycreamcheee,2025-05-07T17:10:00,9

"Yeah people are looking into figuring out what happened at Oregon state now. Itâ€™s only a matter of time until someone brings it up. It was about 10 years ago, it should be easy to find since that residency is 5 or 6 years, I forget",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T20:55:38,2
The high-school Mean Girl thatâ€™s press secretary is 27.  Stephen Miller is 39 but looks like Nosferatu.  Hate ages these ghouls like milk left out in the sun.,Tainted_Bruh,2025-05-07T18:15:08,13
