"""Katie Hodds...Rejects...Bills on Election Integrity....""  Be realistic, how else was she to get elected in the first place?  How do you expect her to stay in office?  Be realistic, Democrat is gonna Democrat.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-27T07:38:25,24
i.e. - she keeps Arizona a cesspit state,ITrCool,2025-04-26T21:21:18,90
Soon she'll be ex-governor.,Dependent-Aside-9750,2025-04-27T09:12:17,6
"She's been HORRIBLE for our state, and Fontez is a close second.  Neither of them want anything to do with securing elections.  Arizona does not require proof of citizenship, only a sworn statement. ""I pinkie-promise swear..."" is good enough for them.",Ida_PotatHo,2025-04-26T23:02:57,29
Worst governor in my 45 years here. What an embarrassment.,BercCoffee,2025-04-26T23:58:55,27

"Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a large portion of the bills sent to her this session by the Republican dominated Arizona Legislature. So far this year, she vetoed 52 and signed 70 into law.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T23:42:27,7
"The American people should watch closely at what happens in these days, to see who is really on their side.",AstraVolans_21,2025-04-27T01:49:48,8
"Dems have been fighting like hell 24/7 for the past decade, while GOP has largely been playing the *""I ALREADY did a thing today""* game when the thing they did was just for their financiers instead of their voters.  We should be asking why our own side doesn't fight so hard.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-26T21:59:16,9
Arizona voted for this. The voters there made their own luck.,daved1113,2025-04-27T07:26:32,-1
"Arizona is not really a cesspit state though... most of AZ laws are very libertarian/conservative leaning (maximum gun rights, low taxes, pro-parent and school choice, business-friendly, etc.) because she was preceded by a long line of Republican governors who typically enacted reasonable policies. She has not been able to really liberalize or walk back the GOP agenda that is in place because she has no control of the state congress, which currently both chambers are controlled by republicans as they have been for a long time. All she is doing is stone-walling the republican congress from getting anything done like passing an election integrity bill. She is a completely useless obstructionist who needs to be shown the door, but I wouldn't conflate her own shortcomings as governor with Arizona's shortcomings. Most of the current state laws and policies are conservative and are the opposite of what Katie Hobbs wants for the state. She would turn it into California lite if congress let her.",TheSleepyTruth,2025-04-27T01:22:07,34
"I hate it! Due to the Kalifornication people moving here is why we got her, the Dem AG, Kelly and Gallego. I hope Robson or Biggs wins the Governor spot next year.",Status_Control_9500,2025-04-26T21:28:26,36
Then why didn’t AZ elect Lake?  I don’t get it ,ButterYourOwnBagel,2025-04-27T02:36:19,10
They actually didn't.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-27T07:43:12,4
"AZ has been a hotbed entry state for illegal immigration, perhaps President Trump federalizing the border will help since that means AZ gov can't prevent the border there from being patrolled or secured and illegal immigration slowly drains out of the state. But that doesn't guarantee AZ becomes a solid red state anytime soon.",ITrCool,2025-04-26T21:30:09,23
Dude. She made a deal with the cartels and had a lot of extra votes from peeps who were born elsewhere,sowellpatrol,2025-04-26T23:27:46,12
Keep up.  Hobbs was in direct control of the election.  Remember the heat maps?  Remember all the printer/scanner problems only in republican areas?,letmeinfornow,2025-04-27T07:41:18,16
Lake was too far gone on the crazy train and it’s turning democrats into more attractive candidates. Did so for the senate race this year too. Lamb would’ve had a better shot at winning than Lake did against Gallegos.,kgthdc2468,2025-04-27T07:37:00,12
We got Californicated.,BercCoffee,2025-04-27T14:20:39,2
How did she become Governor then? Am I missing something here?,daved1113,2025-04-27T07:44:13,1
"True, Yuma County doubled its votes overnight!",Status_Control_9500,2025-04-27T00:04:48,14
"You don't remember the huge debacle where she literally ran the election, refused to recuse herself?  Then huge heat maps were found in the main election office showing where the majority of Republicans vote, and just coincidentally, those were the areas where the printers and scanners had 'technical problems', and huge amounts of Arizona voters couldn't vote.  This literally happened, and the media acted like it was just another day ending in Y.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-27T07:59:47,11
I never looked into it or heard about it but I'm not surprised. How horrible.,daved1113,2025-04-27T08:44:31,2
"Massive scandal the media completely swept under the rug.  Even if there was no hanky panky and it was all coincidental, the idea that she oversaw her own election without recusing herself is insane.  [Calls Grow for Katie Hobbs to Not Oversee Arizona Election | TIMECalls Grow for Katie Hobbs to Not Oversee Arizona Election | TIME](https://time.com/6227705/katie-hobbs-role-election-chief-arizona-governors-race/)  Here is Reuters running cover on the Heat Maps:  [Fact Check: Heat map showing Republican voters in Maricopa County does not prove that voter fraud was committed during the midterm elections | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/heat-map-showing-republican-voters-in-maricopa-county-does-not-prove-that-voter-idUSL1N33A1TR/)  Here is NBC running cover on the printer/scanner problems...problems that only developed in heavy republican areas.....as shown on the heat maps the elections office had on their walls, the same election office Hobbs over saw.  [Printer problems in Arizona election traced to changes in ballot paper](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/printer-problems-arizona-election-traced-changes-ballot-paper-rcna79062)  Is it possibly a coincidence?  Sure.  But being the both houses are majority Republican really makes one wonder.  Had she recused herself when she announced her campaign, then the perception of conspiracy would be greatly diminished.  But she is a Democrat....it's \[D\]ifferent for them.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-27T09:08:17,5
