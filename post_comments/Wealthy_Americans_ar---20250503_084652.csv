(Denmark) or ""Our mothers can take two years off from work to raise their new baby."" (Czech Republic) or (when asked about people who might take advantage of the system) ""Sure, some people will do that..but it's better for our society as a whole if people have health care and and know they can get help if they need it..."" (The Netherlands)  The average tax rate in the U.S. is from 17% to 37% - one of the lowest in the world for an industrialized country.(some of these countries have a 50%-60% rate).....yet all Americans do is scream about ""taxes"".
