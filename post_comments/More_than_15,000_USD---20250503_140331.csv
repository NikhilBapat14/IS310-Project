"## Important Points:  While just 3,877 USDA employees signed up for the first deferred resignation program offered in January, **11,305 agreed to leave under the second round**.  USDA is targeting as many as **30,000 job cuts**, including through its forthcoming reduction-in-force plans. Many staffers say they’ve made the difficult decision **to resign rather than face what they describe as a climate of surveillance and fear**.  The readout notes that **555 employees at the Food Safety and Inspection Service**, the agency that handles **meat inspections and helps respond to the bird flu outbreak, took the offer to resign**.  “There have been a few departures of people who were most knowledgeable or who had been there for many years,” the person wrote in a text message. “People who will be very hard to replace.”",Aakash7aak,2025-05-03T14:12:02,36
"Just to be clear, this isn’t the end of cuts to USDA staff. These people who left are the people who saw the writing on the wall and voluntarily resigned their positions rather than get fired. However, you should know as taxpayers that these people are getting paid salary and benefits through September 30, 2025 to sit at home and NOT work; they didn’t resign and come off the payroll so there is no savings to the taxpayer.  Sec Rollins still has yet to announce what the plans are for coming layoffs but based on the WH budget proposal, we are going to get decimated. She has said to the media that she plans to announce what USDA is doing as far as layoffs at some point between beginning and mid May. She has kept the entire USDA staff in the dark about what comes next. It’s appalling the way she treats her employees. There’s also talk of moving all the DC-based USDA employees to ‘hubs’ in red states to be ‘closer to the farmers’ but still no word on where these hubs actually are and if they’ll pay relocation. People who aren’t ready to be moved to a mystery flyover state are some of the people who voluntarily resigned.  Looking forward to her going on the Sunday shows tomorrow with her charts and looking like the lying idiot she is. If you have 5 minutes, contact your elected representatives about the shit this administration is putting federal employees through. There’s a lot of us trying to hold the line to prevent Trump sycophants from getting control, and any little bit helps.",YoullHaveToFireMe,2025-05-03T16:02:14,9
"Isn't it great that we're getting rid of all the inspectors for our food, canceling all the people that inspect air quality, water quality, soils quality etc. Why do we need all those people, let business regulate itself. We can always trust businesses to look out for the consumer and not pollute the environment or put cancer causing products in our foods, the soils the air, and the water. It's just a waste of money. We should be proud that Der Fuhrer is looking out for the well-being of the citizenry and not himself and big business.  /s",TopEagle4012,2025-05-03T14:19:36,13

"I'm lucky enough to live 30 miles from where my  beef is raised. My consumption is low enough that it would not be a culinary travesty if it wasn't an option.    The majority of beef in the US comes from Texas, a State well known for its distain for regulation. These new changes will not help.    Not that a public health crisis related to Texan beef is something I want anyone, even MAGA, to endure. But the The Trump administration sure does.",citizenjones,2025-05-03T18:09:39,1

"The past decade has shown they will accept any amount of suffering or indignity if they see it as endearing to Trump. It’s complete subservience. Really, it makes them the ultimate mark for scams.   I’m almost tempted to start making and selling low-quality chocolate bars and call them Trump Turds. Make the packaging all bright red, white, and blue.
