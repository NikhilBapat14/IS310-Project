I’m sure it will be no surprise to anyone that it is *explicitly* illegal for the president to direct the IRS to remove an organization’s tax exempt status.   I expect an eventual supreme court decision about whether that clause in the statute unconstitutionally limits the president’s authority over the executive branch.,finallytisdone,2025-05-02T10:52:51,2

"There is an argument towards reviewing and possibly removing tax exempt status from universities.

Republicans are not doing enough to protect their constituents from Democrats and it is possible the Democrats are doing nothing because this is the playbook for change.   Evangelical churches that close during hurricanes and use the church for political purposes revoked.   Domestic terrorist like Jan 6 could go to Gitmo next time.   Student loans can be forgiven even if the court says no.   School or Mass shooters are reason for strict gun control and DOJ can use the registry and no knock warrant to get the gun. Beto will be the Gun Violence Czar.   This is a slippery slope when the checks and balances are not in place.,Morepastor,2025-05-02T09:12:33,-8

">There is an argument towards reviewing and possibly removing tax exempt status from universities. The cost of education certainly has skyrocketed    Taking money away from universities will not make education less expensive. If your goal is to burn US higher education to the ground, leaving behind only hollowed-out shells of the most prestigious universities to educate the  children of the wealthiest elite, then taxing universities is a great way to go about it. Otherwise, taxing universities a terrible idea.   In addition to bleeding endowments dry, stripping universities and colleges of tax-exempt status will drive away donors. No one is going to give money when (a) it doesn't qualify as a charitable donation and (b) some of it will go to the government instead of the institution the donor is attempting to support. Among other things, the resulting financial downspiral will drive top researchers out of the US and lock out promising grad students/early career researchers from other countries.",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-02T10:37:04,1

"College was largely free until the 1980s, now you need to spend six figures for most schools.  I kind of do think higher education should be burned down.

"This is not an invention. 1 - they have a  18% approval rating because they aren’t doing anything. That is bad. 2 - If you can use some critical thinking skills this is a message for conservatives, these are the things they worry about most and they are setting the precedent that a President has the power and authority to do anything they want. This should concern them and this is why we have checks and balances.
