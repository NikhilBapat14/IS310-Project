"The half brother of Vice President JD Vance is projected to finish in the top two in Tuesday‚Äôs primary race for Cincinnati mayor, according to the Associated Press, and will advance to the general election in November.  Cory Bowman ‚Äî an evangelical pastor and coffee shop owner who shares the same father as Vance ‚Äî ran in the nonpartisan primary as one of two Republicans to challenge Democrat Aftab Pureval, the incumbent mayor. Bowman finished a distant second to Pureval, with¬†[about 13 percent](https://results.votehamiltoncountyohio.gov/OH/Hamilton/123661/web.345435/#/summary)¬†of the vote. But as the top two vote-getters, Pureval and Bowman will face off in November.  Republican Brian Frank, a procurement specialist who ran with the slogan ‚ÄúMake Cincinnati Great Again,‚Äù was projected to come in third and not qualify for the runoff.  Bowman has no previous political experience but¬†[told the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-2025-cincinnati-mayor-ohio-vance-sibling-d4dd68e0ea2ff4db00eb7b660b8e4d25)¬†that he felt inspired to run for something after watching Vance get inaugurated as vice president in January.

"A few months ago, Corey Bowman called J.D Vance a ""role model"".  A boy (I can't even call JD a ""young man"") with no sense of identity who's only in this position, because, of doing ""favors"" for Peter Thiel, who's obsession with birthrates is so creepy to the point where before I got to know his history/childhood/past, I was under the impression he was a legit pedophile, and, who thinks even rape victims should be forced to have babies is *such* a ""role model"", you gotta be kidding me.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-07T14:16:04,1
"Since Vance came along, I don't even respect the title of ""vice president"", because, if even that clumsy idiot can be the vice president of the United States, literally *anyone* can.  Oops, I forgot, if he wasn't a prostitute for Peter Thiel, he wouldn't be VP.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-07T14:05:52,2
