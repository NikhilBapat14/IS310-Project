"From the article:  >Tariffs can’t both create permanent domestic jobs and be a temporary negotiating tool.  >Tariffs can’t both protect domestic industries and generate trillions of dollars in revenue.  >You can’t both eliminate the federal budget deficit and protect Social Security, Medicaid and other popular programs.  >You can’t eliminate the federal budget deficit and also cut taxes.  >DOGE’s actions are likely to increase the federal budget deficit, not lower it.  >The national debt can’t matter one day and not the next.  *yes these are all pretty obvious, but I’d imagine those that need to see these aren’t going to click the link lol*",FearlessSea4270,2025-04-28T13:04:46,17

Cuz the so-called 'president' is just tossing darts at a wall of ideas and doing whatever the darts hit?,Im_gumby_damnit,2025-04-28T12:57:58,3
They were never meant to work for anyone but the global elite/billionaires.. AKA his real constituents.,garybussy69420,2025-04-28T14:07:23,3
"Here’s dumb question: how the hell are a kind of economics “conservative?” Isn’t it supposed to be a science, where the goal is to find the most correct predictive model? How does being conservative matter?   It doesn’t take an economist to understand why Trump’s chaos and bluster as a global economic policy is doomed to fail because it it’s sheer incompetence . .  They are just or serious people.  Makes me wonder why we put so much stock in their opinions if they color their entire model on a specific political bent? Sounds made up.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-04-28T13:29:23,6
Problem is he gets in front of the camera and shouts eggs are down 97% and gas is $1.98 a gallon. And there are rubes who believe that shit despite not seeing anything close to those number with their own eyes. So they believe these ass backwards policies are working.,Physical-Dare5059,2025-04-28T13:21:59,2
"It’s pretty much a hocus-pocus blue smoke and mirrors situation for Trumps economy. I work heavy construction and we’re not building new factories and even if we where, I’m sure they would be highly automated. AI and robots making money for the billionaires.",NoReserve7293,2025-04-28T13:35:45,2

"Also - people.  People have agency and won't react to policy changes the way an economic theorist would imagine, unless they are working closely with social scientists and other ""softer"" disciplines.  They're trying out ideas they bounced around in a vacuum and on paper, and expect people to react a certain way and get frustrated when they don't fall in line.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-28T13:12:50,7
"Headline should be     ""I am a graduate of public high school in California*. I passed year-long courses in US History and US Government/Economics. Here is why Trump's plans won't work.""       *most US States have a year each of US History and US Government/Economics as a graduation requirement for public HS.    Obviously, some people will either somehow skirt this requirement, cheat their way through, or forget everything they learned in HS.",cone_snail,2025-04-28T16:55:15,6
