"“But the tariffs themselves, especially the 145% tax on Chinese imports, have had an almost immediate impact, especially on American small businesses.”   I’ve been beating this drum for some time now. The uncertainty is paralyzing business  with the uncertainty of costs and inventory. Navarro will be Trumps downfall if he continues to take advice from him and his Treasury Sec is merely a sock puppet designed to put a happy face on Trumps 50 year old bachelors economic degree brain farts.  At the moment we’re in the calm before the storm, the buzz on Bloomberg is a steady stream of ""wtf?"" from analysts on how to manage egregious uncertainty. Currently the market is too high on hopium that Trump will listen to reason but there are enough initial signs of supply chains breaking which means a future markets crash.",jpmondx,2025-04-26T08:06:25,41
"Im someone born in EU and living there, as much as I want to channel my energy to hate the US right now, I can’t. Trump is going to make life harder for everyone. But the biggest impact is obviously going to be in US. I really hope this doesn’t get the worst ending.",tacoseatingllama,2025-04-26T08:01:44,21
"Yeah....I think most of us get we are going to suffer financially under ""Mr. 200 Deals"".",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-26T08:07:36,10
It’s going to get way worse soon. I asked my liquor store owner what he thought about the tariffs and he said he has deals to lock in prices for 3 months so it hasn’t affected him yet.  Well we are getting pretty close to that time.  I imagine a lot of businesses have similar deals.,Individual_Respect90,2025-04-26T08:30:07,10
I don't think people realize it's not just tariffs but also stuff like a $50 handling fee by the shipping company to deal with all of this nonsense. Per item.  If you have a favorite imported tea or an order of socks that you always buy from Amazon you better get ahold of them because chances are they'll be gone forever after this or so expensive you'll never justify the price.,darsynia,2025-04-26T09:27:21,9
"It feels like mainstream news has promoted and replaced a bunch of staff with people who used to do romance scams and/or online scams, and the been been redeployed to talk about news and economics in this strange tone.  Like everything is this weird attempt to induce FOMO and emotional manipulation, and induce a sense of impending doom/dread but in a way that’s attempting to make the reader feel like it’s personal.  Like if they’re given base text about a subject and their job is to “make it connect more with the audience”, but they don’t respect the audience’s intelligence.",SomeYak5426,2025-04-26T08:01:43,6

"Well it'll just take enough GOPs to loose their livelihood for stuff to happen.. let it happen. Besides thell be the ones out of a job when judiciary and congress to be abolishes,, then trump will steal their money,,, what could go wrong?",Creative-Strength-60,2025-04-26T17:52:17,1
"Trucker's wife chiming in -  It's worse than anyone knows. The supply chain is crumbling and layoffs in the industry are starting. Ports will be mostly dark inside 1 week, empty shelves within 2, national emergency within 3. Civil unrest will start when ports shut down and people start asking questions. As soon as the media gets hold of it and starts running stories, panic will set in. People will strip stores and there won't be any re-supplies coming. It will be months of not being able to get basic essentials. People will starve. Hospitals will be out of supplies in a few weeks and people will die.  It's absolute economic armageddon. Just the spark trump wants for his stupid insurrection act/martial law.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-04-26T16:21:49,14
"No, that's just SEO and engagement-bait. Anger and fear keep readers scrolling.  However, that doesn't mean the situation overall isn't really, really bad and already putting people out of jobs and onto streets, right now. It's hard to even find words to describe just how much trump's insanity is currently turning everything upside down in the entire world.  I recommend to just go to less ... excited news outlets. DW is great. Anything that's not directly part of the US political civil war insanity.",anti-DHMO-activist,2025-04-26T08:37:14,8
