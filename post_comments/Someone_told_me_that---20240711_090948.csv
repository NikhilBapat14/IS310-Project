"The primary system as we know it now is a very recent system, really only dating back to the 1960s.   The conventions used to be working conventions that came together to actually figure out who to nominate vs having electors bound to the decisions of a primary election.   The first primaries and caucuses were nonbinding and did nothing but indicate a preference in a state.    Jimmy Carter was the first to really take advantage of the system we know now,   Campaigning very early in Iowa at a time he was unknown, realizing an early delegate lead could compound itself into a victory.",olcrazypete,2024-07-11T10:11:09,12
"Electors actually elect the President. Each State has a handful of Electors that elect the President. But at some point (most) State laws were structured such that the public’s vote is who the Electors need to elect.   But going back to the former, it actually wasn’t that different from how the governing coalition picks the Prime Minister in a Parliamentary system (instead of the public directly voting for an individual)",SovietRobot,2024-07-11T09:49:44,4
"> And I’m not talking about the process of choosing the one party candidate who then goes head to head with the other party candidate in the election.  I think you're confusing two things. What you're describing did absolutely happen to pick the presidential *candidates* in the election--it wasn't until 1972 that the modern primary system came into use to pick the candidates, as a result of the chaos at the 1968 Democratic convention. (Before that, the candidates were selected at the convention; some states held primaries but they generally weren't binding.) But that's separate from the process of picking the actual president once the candidates have been established.  The president himself is selected by the Electoral College, where each state has delegates to elect a president. As the founding fathers envisioned it, these would be unpledged delegates who could select who they wanted as president--they didn't necessarily have to adhere to what the majority of people in their state wanted. But the states started having elections to determine who their state's candidate should be quite early, and by the early 1800s states were already using the popular vote to determine who their Electoral College delegates should support.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-11T10:57:36,1
"That person is mostly correct. It's not that the party leaders chose the president, but they did choose the presidential *candidate* for their party.   The modern primary system was born in the aftermath of the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention (coincidentally in Chicago, the same as this year). Prior to that, party insiders in the individual states would select delegates to go to the national convention where a lot of speeches, backroom dealing, and multiple rounds of voting would end up hammering out a ticket. Sometimes, the candidate they ended up with hadn't even participated in primaries or caucuses.

"Henry Wallace was the incumbent VP and the people's choice at the 1944 Democratic Convention, but party leaders made sure that he was replaced by Harry Truman. It's an interesting story worth reading about.",rogun64,2024-07-11T18:14:09,1
I’m guessing your acquaintance misinterpreted either the electoral college or the system parties used to select candidates before the modern primary system.    There was never a time where the general public put forth candidates and had party elites select the president from that list.,Mrgoodtrips64,2024-07-11T10:11:42,1
"Early in 1968, Eugene McCarthy, running as the antiwar candidate, forced incumbent LBJ out of the race by beating him in the NH primary (and 1 or 2 others, I think)--8 years before Carter. RFK didn't enter the race till LBJ bowed out. If RFK hadn't been murdered, he would have had the nomination in the bag, but in the event his delegates split between McCarthy and LBJ's veep Humphrey, who went on to lose. Nobody liked Humphrey, and even host mayor and kingmaker Richard Daley tried to draft Ted Kennedy to fill his brothers' shoes, to no avail. But the party's bosses were dead-set against the outsider McCarthy, and would no doubt have found a way to block him even if he'd arrived with a solid majority of delegates.  In 1972, McGovern (like McCarthy an heir to the Progressive tradition of the northern Midwest) beat the DNC candidate Ed Muskie in the primaries, but had to use every trick in the book to hold on to his advantage at the convention. I think it was his all-star team that really nailed down the change from conventions being inherently crooked to being a reflection of the voters' will as expressed in the primaries.",coleman57,2024-07-11T12:02:51,3
And the reason the Founders set up the EC system was specifically as insulation against a persuasive demagogue swaying the masses into electing an unsuitable President and undermining the whole democratic experiment. Nice try.,coleman57,2024-07-11T12:06:31,1
"Thanks! Do you think this process is better than our current one? I feel like now we just pick who we know from popular culture like some celebrity or pick someone that makes ridiculous claims and promises like they will bring back all the jobs China stole to the USA and cut off all ties with Mexico and grow our economy ten fold and make the national debt zero etc. And the general public who aren’t experts in politics will just vote based on those quick sound bites/tweets and/or knowing the person from tv or movies or as a ceo, like the ceo of McDonald’s.",poopyfacemcpooper,2024-07-11T11:45:25,1
"> If RFK hadn't been murdered, he would have had the nomination in the bag  This is a huge overstatement. RFK was still pretty far behind Humphrey in delegates when he was killed (although pledged delegates was far from definitive back then). [Here's an article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/05/rfk-bobby-kennedy-myth-legend-history-218593/) that lays out many of the difficulties that RFK would have faced.",curien,2024-07-11T14:11:20,2
"There are problems with both systems.  In 1968, the country was deeply divided about the Vietnam War. There were huge protests on college campuses across the US. One of the Democratic candidates, Robert F. Kennedy (father of the man running this year), was assassinated while campaigning and the Warsaw Pact (led by Russia) had just invaded its neighbor Czechoslovakia. (Lots of echoes in this year's race, huh?)  Against that whole background, the Democratic party ended up nominating the candidate more aligned with continuing US participation in the Vietnam war, even though rank and file party members were largely backing the anti-war candidate. It caused a lot of internal conflict and the nominee went on to get beaten badly in the general election. Regular Democratic voters blamed the elites, calling them out of touch.  But as you point out, in the modern system, when a primary is controlled entirely by the voting members of *only that party*, there's a chance they can choose an extremist candidate who won't appeal to the larger electorate, or a super populist who makes a lot of promises they can't keep. This too can result in the party losing.  The Democrats tried to solve this by implementing a ""hybrid"" type of system, where most of the delegates were selected in the primaries, but a bunch of party insiders, called ""super-delegates,"" would also participate in the process of selecting the nominee. In 2016, when Bernie Sanders was competing with Hillary Clinton for the nomination, these super-delegates became an issue, because they were seen as representing the interests of the party instead of the voters (which was exactly their purpose). A compromise was reached where super-delegates weren't allowed to vote on the first ballot, but if there was no clear majority of support behind a candidate such that subsequent ballots were necessary, they could vote.  The point is, there are pros and cons to each system and the whole concept of how parties choose their nominee has been in tension for over 60 years, with everyone trying to figure out how to balance the preferences of primary voters with the desire to put forth a winning candidate.",nosecohn,2024-07-11T12:19:35,2
"Thanks--excellent article. I only very recently learned that he didn't actually sew up the nomination in Cali, after believing that myth was fact since my 11th birthday. This article clarifies the Dem incumbent-challengers of both '68 and '80. I still remember Teddy's disastrous 60 Minutes interview, and then Carter's debate debacle ~8-10 months later. My friend and I watched it in a bar, and when he talked about depending on the foreign policy advice of his daughter Amy, we both groaned--the nation's fate was sealed. The quote from the guy in Queens about needing a father figure was especially chilling. Ain't no doubt about who he likes now, if he's still alive.",coleman57,2024-07-11T14:34:22,2
