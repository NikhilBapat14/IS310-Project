"A crash is coming.  The recent 20 % drop was just a correction from the 40 % run up in 2023 and 2024.  The pain from the multitude of bad acts by Trump are not priced in.  We are head towards a depression comparable to 1929  Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidency is already descending into disarray amid a legal morass, self-inflicted errors, and a vast gap between its massive ambition and its capacity to enact that vision. Exhausting  crises on multiple fronts point to a potentially failed administration.  A recession that the president seems determined to talk the country into might puncture the bubble of achievement that the White House falsely cultivates each day. High prices and job losses, don‚Äôt discriminate between Republican and Democratic voters.  Hubris is threatening an administration that has made overreaches by previous presidents seem tame by comparison.  Trump‚Äôs victory, while clear, was not a landslide. Together with a tiny GOP majority in the House, it‚Äôs a thin political platform on which to base an attempt to simultaneously remake the global geopolitical system and the world trading paradigm; to transform the US government; and to destroy elite establishment centers of power. Weeks ago, the Washington narrative was that Trump‚Äôs second-term team would be more disciplined and unified than his first. But that‚Äôs looking increasingly incorrect.  Backbiting and organizational chaos at the Pentagon came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed fears about his fitness for the job by posting details of military strikes in Yemen on two Signal chats.  Trump‚Äôs trade wars have wiped trillions off global stock markets and are likely soon to hike prices for inflation-weary US shoppers.  His threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have shattered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading to its worst April since the Great Depression.  And the world is wondering whether the dollar is a haven anymore. All of this may be behind an apparent and emerging climbdown that the administration signaled on Tuesday on the China tariffs and Trump‚Äôs warnings that he might fire the central bank chief.  ‚ÄòMHis purge of first-term officials who knew how Washington worked is resulting in embarrassing accidents. An undocumented migrant from Maryland was deported by mistake to El Salvador, igniting a massive legal showdown. And the administration set off a feud with Harvard University, apparently by mistake.  Trump‚Äôs claims that the force of his personality alone would end wars made him look foolish. His Ukraine peace effort looks amateur. Carnage is still raging in Gaza.  He‚Äôs destroyed America‚Äôs closest diplomatic friendship, with Canada, with unhinged demands it become the 51st state. His bullying means many tourists are staying away, frightened by potential harassment at US borders. Allies are making alternative arrangements, thereby diminishing American power.  There has been no blizzard of lawmaking to bolster Trump‚Äôs claims he‚Äôs had the most successful first 100 days in generations. How Republicans will pass his huge tax plan is unclear.  Tax season at the Internal Revenue Service was marked by dysfunction, with a revolving door of acting commissioners at the key agency.  Elon Musk‚Äôs evisceration of the US government may be setting up a series of disasters that are not yet evident. Massive funding cuts may gut US emergency preparedness as hurricane season approaches. Canceled health research on diseases like cancer may cause unnecessary deaths in years to come. The mistaken firing and hurried rehiring of technicians who look after nuclear weapons seems like an emblem of the Tesla chief‚Äôs tenure in Washington, which he said on Tuesday he‚Äôd soon begin to scale back.  And Trump‚Äôs incessant demands for more power have pushed the United States to the brink of one of the worst constitutional crises in 250 years. The forest of legal challenges has also severely disrupted many of the administration‚Äôs top priorities, including its signature mass deportation program.  Trump‚Äôs tariff wars seem insane to Wall Street investors and middle-class Americans who‚Äôve seen their 401(k) plans plummet.  Trump‚Äôs America first creed horrifies the foreign policy establishment and threatens to undo generations of US leadership.  America‚Äôs reputation abroad is being slammed by Trump‚Äôs dismantling of USAID, genuflection to Russian President Vladimir Putin and abandonment of Africa.  A veteran of those early 21st-century wars, Hegseth now runs the Pentagon. His defenestration of senior uniformed officers who advocated diversity might be unfairly wrecking military careers and rocking the leadership of the world‚Äôs most lethal military. But the former Fox News anchor has the support of conservative media ‚Äì one reason Trump is standing by him despite reports of his cavalier attitude to classified information.  As  the daily pandemonium unfolds, it‚Äôs worth remembering that this divisive presidency is a dangerous failure.",HawaiiStockguy,2025-04-26T15:36:44,6
