"Glenn Youngkin is really going to hurt the woman running this year. He was able to fool swing voters in a off year election, with them ""I'm not maga"" 2001 Republican who doesn't say the quiet parts out loud, but does them anyway schtick. I don't see the GOP candidate doing well at all, especially since she's a black woman, she's not going to get swing voters, and she's not going to turn out maga because she's obviously not the r(white)ight color.  Getting Virginia back under a Democratic Governor and winning other state seats would be a good morale booster, through all this shit.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-07T11:48:25,10
