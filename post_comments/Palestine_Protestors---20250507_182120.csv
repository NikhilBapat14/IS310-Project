Columbia University is a private university. They have no constitutional right to protest and disrupt the campus. There should not be identify or face arrest. It should be Identify AND BE arrested.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-07T18:39:22,135

"Police interaction -> failure to identify -> handcuffs -> transport -> booking.  Traditionally it means the person has warrants (why else) but in modern times it can also mean the person just wants to pick a fight with the police thinking it'll get them a million subscribers and jumpstart their influencer career.  Just because they call their mass disruption event a protest doesn't mean nobody can do anything about it, police can still run their ID to see if they have any warrants and they can still book them for fighting that process.  It's always:  \>block traffic  *>I HAVE RIIIIIGGGHTTS!!! (and everyone else has to listen to me scream at them instead of getting what they're here for, which is their own right and their own business)*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T19:36:29,36
