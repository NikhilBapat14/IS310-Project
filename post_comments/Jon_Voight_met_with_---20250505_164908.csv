"It has long been known that [Trump often apes the last person he talks to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/).  Wouldn't be surprised if Voight made an offhand remark, blowing smoke up his ass about how awesome his tariffs are, then said they needed something like that to protect Hollywood movies. This is the result.",travio,2025-05-05T17:03:18,22
Ha ha ha of COURSE he spoke to Jon Voight  Just imagine the fucking idiot conversation between those two imbeciles  Clueless how films are made in 2025  That Trump inly singled out film productions and not tv just shows even more how fucking stupid he is  This tariff idea will go away in less than 48 hours when it's explained to him and studios make a fake promise to try their bestest hardest to shoot more in America,ElPlywood,2025-05-05T17:04:34,9
Why couldn’t a giant snake eat the real Jon Voight?,Greenman8907,2025-05-05T17:05:43,5
This idiot is 86 years old. He hasn’t had a role that goes beyond a cameo in over a decade. He has zero idea how films are financed these days.   Films require international funding. From the biggest blockbusters to the smallest indies. Any sort of ‘tariff’ will result in retaliation and absolutely wreck this business model. Hollywood also make as much as 55% of their revenues from foreign markets. This industry is actually one of the few industries that actually has a trade surplus with the rest of the world. Of course Trump wants to wreck it.  I wish these boomers will just grab some hamberders and do as a favor already.,Funkymonkeyhead,2025-05-05T20:07:13,5

You mean the guy from National Treasure?  Because that’s all I remember him from aside from his more famous and talented daughter.,toodlelux,2025-05-05T17:53:21,3

There is no coherent conversation happening between these two. Except maybe about how long their balls hang,beadzy,2025-05-05T17:46:06,2
