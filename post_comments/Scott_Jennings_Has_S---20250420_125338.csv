"As long as Abrego Garcia has been in the news, Jennings has been chiming in to pointing out how foolish Democrats are for standing by this illegal immigrant who is also a member of MS-13 and who was alleged to have abused his wife. Jennings did so again on Friday.  But democrats donâ€™t listen! Trump playing chess while you still play checkers!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T13:18:08,12
Nice to see some Repubs play smart offense for once.,KevtheKnife,2025-04-20T13:04:48,9
"I don't know this guy but I have to thank him for standing firm on this issue.  I was worried about how the current administration and their bulldozer tactic would influence voters in the next cycle, but if democrats really want to support illegal immigrants from El Salvador over American families, than I think we will win again.  The stakes are just too high right now globally to hand over the Whitehouse to Dems in the next election, and perhaps I was mistaken by wanting Trump to be a unifier. The whole ""they weren't going to vote for us anyway"" tactic always seemed harsh to me.  Hearing this mother's testimony about her daughter brought tears to my eyes and reminded me that we really do need to fight against the Left. At least until they chose to course-correct their agenda, which so far evidently isn't on the table.",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-20T14:36:58,-1
