"I've been to six protests so far, the most recent on Friday.  They're all a lot of fun and it's nice to be with other people who feel the same way I do about Trump.    But make no mistake - in the 21st century with our fragmented media most people never even hear about these protests and with the media in the hands of right-wing oligarchs, those that **do** see them on the news will see them in a bad light.      The other thing about all six protests I've attended is that they're 80% boomers.   A handful of young people, some brought kids, but overwhelmingly **boomers**.   I'm in my 70's and took part in Vietnam and civil rights demonstrations in the 60s and 70s and those were much more demographically diverse.   Chanting and waving placards makes for a fun afternoon but it will take **action** not words to stop Trump.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T09:55:30,326

"Sadly in think we are past gathering for peaceful protests and patting ourselves on the back for simply making signs and posting them on IG.

"I'm not sure protests are going to be enough at this point.  A national social 1-3-day strike to supplement the protests would get more people involved. Essentially everyone sits out work for that time period. (I'm guessing even young people would embrace that idea.)  Nothing runs. Nothing works. No stores are opened. No planes or trains are flying/running. No shelves are restocked, no sales are made, no gas stations open..and on and on.  They can't arrest everyone and already 36% of Americans say they will join a protest if given a chance. As one person said: ""Our country doesn’t run without the workers who make it run.”      Yes, there will be scabs (MAGA) who will still go their jobs. The point is to show overwhelming support for a change in direction from Trump's agenda. There is an election coming up, and yes, they are doing horrific damage in the meantime. But - if you want to get your point across...bring the country to a standstill. That will show them the power we have as Americans who still believe in democracy.They WILL notice.",progressiveprepper,2025-04-27T12:53:40,6

"The best theorized reason I’ve heard about why it’s older people, is that the younger people went to BLM protests and pro Palestine protests, and then they faced consequences for going.   I do think for younger people, it’s hard to imagine politics being anything else, especially because there isn’t something concrete we are fighting FOR. It’s all mostly opposing Trump, with no talk of the better future to fight for. That’s why Bernie’s Oligarchy tour is doing well.   Plus, a lot of these protests are Democratic Party coded, and most young people I know have become completely disenchanted with the Democratic Party after this last election.    That’s not to say we shouldn’t be protesting. We all need to do our part. Yelling at young people to go to protests doesn’t inspire them to go. Instead, make it seem easy and fun to go. Start messaging about what we are fighting for, instead of what we are against. Anger and fear don’t turn people out, but anger and hope does.",kateg22,2025-04-27T17:30:59,8

"Boomers don't have nearly as much to lose as everyone else because they're mostly retired and don't have a whole lot of years left. They also remember a time when things were better. Zoomers and younger millennials are afraid of losing their jobs because jobs these days are hard to come by due to the job market being what it is now, with things like lean staffing, ghost jobs, and applicant tracking systems bloating job-hunting websites with fake jobs that don't actually exist or aren't intended to be filled. There's also a sort of learned helplessness exacerbated by an addiction to technology and social media that is fostering a pervasive nihilism amongst younger people. They don't feel heard or represented because politics is dominated by corrupt interests that are propped up by sophisticated propaganda and extremely wealthy oligarchs who are immune to consequences. They see the world dying around them and don't feel like they have any power to stop it because they see real power in this world being represented by money. The firehose of bullshit is also an extremely effective tactic at wearing them down and making them too mentally tired to react. Many of them also spent some of their most critical formative years isolated by the pandemic and are now less emotionally mature and more agoraphobic because they aren't accustomed to face-to-face social interactions or stress management.

Most people are scared to get the ball rolling, hardly anyone is in a position to be the first person to step forward. But that's exactly what makes these types of protests worthwhile. They attract more and more people, they build morale and keep the idea alive that the current situation is not okay. People will *feel* that they aren't alone in thinking this administration needs to be stopped.

"I am an older Millennial and I also noticed this pattern. There were obviously younger people too, but very noticeably less than the 50+ crowd. This was on a weekend protest so no excuse. Its truly depressing.   I’ve asked friends my age, even politically aware ones and it seems to stem from different things: 1) Fear of losing their jobs or of being detained. One is a federal worker for example and though hes a Dem, he says he does not want to risk his job by being seen. I told him we have the First Amendment in this country and it’s his right to peacefully protest - he believes that this right no longer exists in practice. 2) Fear of guilt by association: one of my friends, also a Dem is a graduate student. He is pretty well off and does not fear personal harm by protesting, but he has basically been advised not to “cause waves” by his department at his university and that any activity he takes place in could reflect badly on them. While they haven’t (and can’t) explicitly tell him not to participate, they’ve made it pretty clear that they do not want him doing so since they rely on federal funds and are worried about retaliation from the administration. 3)Apathy. Many are tired of it and just want it to go away. They feel that there is no point to protesting and that there are no benefits to be gained.  I am so disappointed in them. If this is what younger generations stand for, then authoritarianism is in our future once again.",antigop2020,2025-04-27T15:28:51,8

So many younger people could not have dared go to this, no matter how much they wanted to. We wanted to go, but we were working. We're being compensated roughly like any children you would've had coming of age in the 1980s, too. Nothing has kept up for us. Everything has taken steps backward. It's so hard just to exist in this country now, at our age. Even if we won't be fired, the loss of a day's wages in and of itself may be brutal.  A lot of us can't take a day like this on any date we choose without immediate termination -- even with all the advance notice in the world, many employers feel completely free to just say ""nope, not that day."" Still more of us are living paycheck to paycheck, and the few of us that have decided to go ahead and have children have them to feed.  It would have been lovely to be retired and in possession of a Boomer-level savings account .... it would have been lovely to have the OPTION to have the day to go and do that, or even live in a country that would force an employer to account for the odd day out now and again ... but neither thing is true for us.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1933_German_federal_election  Federal elections were held in Germany on 5 March 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January and just six days after the Reichstag fire. The election saw Nazi stormtroopers unleash a widespread campaign of violence against the Communist Party (KPD), left-wingers,[1]: 317  trade unionists, the Social Democratic Party[1] and the Centre Party.[1]: 322  They were the last multi-party elections in a united Germany until 1990.  The 1933 election followed the previous year's two elections (July and November) and Hitler's appointment as Chancellor. In the months before the 1933 election, SA and SS displayed ""terror, repression and propaganda ... across the land"",[1]: 339  and Nazi organizations ""monitored"" the vote process. In Prussia 50,000 members of the SS, SA and Der Stahlhelm were ordered to monitor the votes by acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring, as auxiliary police.[citation needed]  The Nazi Party (NSDAP) saw a large increase in votes and seats compared to the November 1932 election and gained a Reichstag majority together with its coalition partner, the German National People's Party (DNVP). This was the first time since 1930 that a governing coalition had held a parliamentary majority. However, despite waging a campaign of terror against their opponents, the Nazis only tallied 43.9 percent of the vote on their own, well short of a majority to govern alone.  This would be the last contested election held in Germany until after World War II. Despite now holding a bare working majority in the Reichstag, Hitler wanted more. Two weeks after the election, he was able to pass an Enabling Act on 23 March with the support of the Nazi Party, the DNVP and the Centre parties, which effectively gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Within months, the Nazis banned all other parties and turned the Reichstag into a rubberstamp legislature comprising only Nazis and pro-Nazi ""guests"".",VanceKelley,2025-04-27T11:41:05,3

"Good point about younger people not knowing anything different.  But ""the 10-15 years prior to that weren't all that hot either""?  I'm no Obama fan but by the time he left office things were looking quite good.  Read [washingtonmonthly.com](http://washingtonmonthly.com)  obamas-top-50-accomplishments-revisited.  (I didn't include an actual link for fear of violating some rule or other.)  In short, Obama inherited the wreckage of what proved to be the worst U.S. recession since the 1930s. The economy contracted by more than 8%. Unemployment doubled, from 5% to 10%—a net loss of some 8 million jobs. Average housing prices dropped by 30%. The cumulative wealth of Americans fell by nearly a quarter: a loss on paper of some $15 trillion.  Obama’s new administration went immediately to work on the largest economic-stimulus bill ever enacted by Congress-about $8oo billion. Much of the money went to tax relief, unemployment insurance and other direct infusions of cash into the pockets of Americans who would, in tum, the administration hoped, spend or invest it. But the new president also seized the chance to pump billions into priorities that would normally struggle to receive much smaller sums. The stimulus bill was packed with record spending on renewable energy, a modern electrical grid, computerization of health-care records, high-speed rail, and new bridges and roads. Obama also directed billions to basic scientific research.  Obama reforms include: the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as ""the ACA"" or ""Obamacare"", the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.  He achieved steep tax increases on higher income Americans designed to fund health care reform, reduce the federal budget deficit, and decrease income inequality.  Removed most US forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, and got the nuclear deal with Iran.",nogooduse,2025-04-27T21:11:07,5
