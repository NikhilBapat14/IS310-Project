It’s justified because of Hunter Biden. /s,Zolomun,2025-05-07T09:19:59,10
"It’s absurd how wild Trump is running with bribes. First he lets Elon musk bribe him to the tune of a quarter billion to run amok in the federal government. Then he let private donors, who he has not yet released names, fund his transition. He solicited bribes to attend his inauguration. And now he’s openly soliciting to anyone in the world to share a room with him for millions or billions of dollars.   Even Trump in 2016 wouldn’t have gotten away with this level of corruption. It’s more proof that the man is above the law currently.  We do not need a king, and leaders who are this corrupt do not deserve any mercy. ",3MATX,2025-05-07T09:39:14,8

"From Bloomberg News reporters [Leonardo Nicoletti](https://x.com/Leonardonclt), [Anthony Cormier](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AV1xJ7TzGso/anthony-cormier), and [David Kocieniewski](https://bloomberg.com/authors/ASG_9tF0AMk/david-kocieniewski):  More than half of the top holders of President Donald Trump’s memecoin — who are jockeying for dinner with the president — have used foreign exchanges that say they ban US users, suggesting that many of the purchasers are based outside the US.  Buyers of the Trump token, a cryptocurrency the president began marketing days before his inauguration, drove sales higher in the past two weeks after its issuers announced an unprecedented promotion: More than 200 of the memecoin’s largest holders would be invited to attend a May 22 dinner with Trump at his Virginia golf club, while the top 25 would qualify for an exclusive reception beforehand and what the memecoin’s [website](https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner) describes as a “VIP” tour.  Now, an analysis by Bloomberg News shows that all but six of the top 25 holders who have registered on the website’s [leaderboard](https://trumpdinner.gettrumpmemes.com/leaderboard?_gl=1*1xtl3ip*_ga*MzMxMDQzMTA1LjE3NDU1OTM3NDc.*_ga_G1ME2HFSXK*MTc0NjExNTEwMi43LjAuMTc0NjExNTEwMi4wLjAuMA) used foreign exchanges that say they exclude customers living in the US. More broadly, at least 56% of the leaderboard’s top 220 holders used similar offshore exchanges. The prevalence of these likely foreign buyers echoes concerns that congressional Democrats have expressed about the ethics of marketing the coin with a promise of presidential access. And it raises questions about how attendees at the promotional dinner, who are publicly identified only by three- or four-letter usernames they’ve chosen, will be vetted.",bloomberg,2025-05-07T09:18:13,2
