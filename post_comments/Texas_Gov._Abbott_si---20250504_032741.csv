"Paying for public school once *and then being required to pay a second time for private* made it a cost barrier - it meant public school is for the poor and private school is for the rich. Like other highly controversial actions of recent history, *this new change actually does something* instead of selling words to get rich in politics.  Implications of racism and elitism are downstream from the cost barrier. If clearing that barrier means some public schools are abandoned because nobody wants to attend them, then also it means those schools were weak links.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-04T11:59:33,6

I sent my kids to private school.  Didnâ€™t want them to associate with the byproduct of a dysfunctional society.,jackdog20,2025-05-04T06:15:42,-2
