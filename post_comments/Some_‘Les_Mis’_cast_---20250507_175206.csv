"I'm surprised the show was still allowed to run considering the running themes throughout the musical.  Of course....you'd have to have some knowledge, intelligence, empathy and historical background to understand the plot....so......",CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-07T18:07:49,49
"They should costume Thénardier in a blue suit with a red cravat, and slap orange paint all over his face. Then just get someone with a vicious hangover to piss all over a spiderweb for the wig.",4ivE,2025-05-07T18:21:00,27

"As if Trump's gonna sit through the full run time of Les Mis.   If he does, he definitely won't be doing it silently, or showing any respect to the performers. Fair play to them refusing to perform on those grounds alone.",LostTheGameOfThrones,2025-05-07T18:25:36,8

Les Misérables is like three hours long - can Trump stay awake for the entire thing?,Constant-Notice849,2025-05-07T20:46:41,11
"I’m actually really nervous about this happening. We were unable to see Les Mis when it came through our city earlier this year due to last minute scheduling conflicts, but the whole family was excited when I saw that it would be playing in DC while we were passing through (we are literally in town for 2 nights and seeing Les Mis on one of them). If freaking Trump causes this show to get cancelled, uugh. Why does he ruin everything?!?",blusher4lyfe,2025-05-09T14:40:58,2
