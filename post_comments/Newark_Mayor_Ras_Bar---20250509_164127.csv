That’s a federal facility.  The same as Fort Sumter.  Attack it at your own peril.,cchris_39,2025-05-10T02:45:42,29

Immigration was one of the big reasons Trump won. And oddly Democrats have double downed on immigration policy so far. Bold strategy cotton. Let's see if it pays off for them.,r777m,2025-05-10T00:04:00,12

This is what an insurrection looks like. Imprison him until every illegal has been deported.,Fact_Stater,2025-05-09T16:44:12,1
"This a great step, although there's still so much more work to. Mayors who break federal law by interfering with ICE must be imprisoned. Nobody is above the law in our country.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-09T16:54:51,7

Was going through the news channels with my father earlier. Funny how CNN and MSNBC were saying how horrible it is for a mayor to get arrested. But only Fox would say why the mayor was arrested.   These people literally did their own Jan 6th but CNN and MSNBC don't want to say that part.,AndForeverNow,2025-05-09T18:14:50,2

And the ICE agents have to wear masks.  What a sad statement about the state of the country.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-10T12:42:32,1
"As a lifelong resident, NJ republicans have no interest in having a republican, let alone a conservative, as governor.  The last gubernatorial election should be proof of that, and yes I know this is about one of our many idiot mayors.  The obvious outcome of that over the years is that we get all of these batshit and barely literate mayors, and NJ state senators representing us with virtually no real opposition.   A NJ Republican politician in this state is essentially the same as  a left of center Democrat in California.",LysanderSpoonersCat,2025-05-09T18:43:50,-7
