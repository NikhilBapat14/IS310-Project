">If sudden sanity sets in and they cleared all tariffs tomorrow, we'll still be receiving tariffed cargo from the 90-day ocean voyage.  Great point - about the cargo and what that means in reference to much higher prices.

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and GOP Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Todd Young of Indiana and Susan Collins of Maine.  >A similar bill is being introduced by Rep.
