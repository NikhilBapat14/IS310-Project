When democrats sent millitary police into student protests last year in Los Angeles it sent a message to us across the country that any real act of resistance will be met with extreme violence and oppression.   The way they treated us pro Palestine kids is why we refuse to act now. Because what will it matter? All you want us to do to fight back is to chant songs and stand with signs. It does NOTHING. Actual civil disobedience does. But that’s discouraged. And the last time civil disobedience was actually occurring was for the Free Palestine movement.

"> and that is an agenda that speaks to the needs of the working class  I'm sorry but that is demonstrable bullshit.  Biden spent 4 years focusing on only middle and lower-income households, the first two years he passed the 2 biggest pieces of legislation for those households, to the tune of nearly $5 trillion dollars (last two years were obstructed by a GOP House majority).  It's simply not true to say Dems haven't focused on the working class.  You can argue about how much they deliver ($5T sounds like a lot) or how quick (in 2 years is extremely quick) or if they ""fee"" like they got something which is a media problem, but it's dishonest to say Dems aren't delivering.

"'Wealth Inequality is Destroying the Fabric of Society' was the lefts message for several decades, especially in the aftermath of Piketty's 2013 book on the subject.

Worse pay, worse benefits, no unions, no guaranteed holidays, COL keeps going up (and is about to get catastrophically worse thanks to the Tariffs)  This is *America*. Our media, our culture, our *everything* has sold us the idea that if we work hard, we'll have a house, a car, a kid, one vacation a year, and medical care.   Men are told they aren't ""real men"" if they aren't *providers* who are able to provide for a trophy wife, even though dual-incomes are needed in most places just to survive.

"And everyone, including Bernie, is either missing or downplaying the true root of the issue, and that is racism. The entire reason 47 and his regime are in the game in the first place is because of racism toward black and brown people. Does everyone remember when Obama was elected? White people thought the world was ending. There were children crying in their mothers' arms. It was intense.   47 is a lightning rod because he appealed to his base's deep hatred, especially after Obama's two terms.  Everything, and I mean everything, comes back to that. From why there are huge costs to colleges, to why universal healthcare isn't a thing, to the fucking ice cream truck song.  Hell, wasn't there an article where a GOP in the Midwest basically said no Medicaid cuts except for the people on ""Welfare?"" Something we all know is a dog whistle for minorities?

People would rather go into a dictatorship where they are paying out the ass due to tariffs, losing their rights every day, and the quality of their food going downhill due to the FDA being gutted than suffer the sight of seeing another black or brown person walking the streets safely.   You can't get rid of America's special brand of Capitalism because it is deeply intertwined with America's special brand of racism. Bernie, AOC, JB Pritzker, or whoever, could find the way to make everything we all want come true with everyone saying they could do it and the steps that they needed to do it in, and yet people will STILL vote against it because minorities will also benefit.

"I’ve read her platform and obviously voted for her and was on social media promoting her for the months before the election and drove people to the polls to vote for her. Bernie supported her.  Bernie wanted Bill Clinton to do more to help people. He opposed Bush cuts to important programs. He wanted Obama to do more to lift up struggling Americans. He and I obviously acknowledge the ACA as a significantly better system than previously while knowing there is more work to be done. People in other countries are shocked that in America if you get cancer or get shot you better win the lottery the next day or you won’t be able to afford to get healthy. And so of course he had criticisms of Hillary for not pushing to do more to help struggling American.  And the American people wanted change in a major way. They voted for fucking Donald Trump in 2016 because he said he would blow everything up and do things “better”. He gave no plan but the nation wanted real change and not the status quo. Hillary promised to improve on the status quo but claimed that Bernie was being too disruptive and was wanting too much change.  In my opinion, the possibility of Rump was much too scary for us to nominate Clinton who had the highest untrustworthy and unlikable ratings of any candidate in history. Not her fault, it was republican lies and bullshit that had painted her as such an awful person, but avoiding the potential of hatemonger donald dump becoming president was too important to choose her as the candidate.  Gallup polls consistently show that 40% of voters identify as independent compared to 30% who identify as Democrat and 30% as Republican. As an Independent and somebody critical of the parties, Bernie was able to bring people in to the Democratic Party that didn’t consider themselves Democrats. As a general election candidate he would have grown the party beyond its base.  Bernie’s message was exactly what the country needed to hear in 2016. If people heard Bernie as the general election candidate talking about how we are all brothers and sisters and that a nation is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable folks among us, the country would have come together more instead of splitting further apart. I do think that people would have voted for the old white guy who was angry about big money interests and passionate about wanting to improve living conditions over the old white guy who was a braggart about his riches and full of hate in every speech.  Bernie was saying at his rallies and news appearances that “I care about your children as I hope you care about mine” and that elderly people shouldn’t have to cut their medicine in half to make the prescription last until they could afford a refill and that he is sick and tired of seeing unarmed black men being shot.  Bernie raised the most amount of money, without accepting superPACs or certain major industry donations, filled stadiums in city after city, inspired memes, and got young people involved in politics for the first time.  Bernie does really well with Independents, he had the youth vote, and if establishment Democrats had gotten on board with the strongest general election candidate in the field, we could have avoided all this shit.",NewAltWhoThis,2025-05-06T13:54:58,1
"From Bernie’s DNC speech. [Read the whole thing if you want context](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-bernie-sanders-dnc-speech-226187).  “Based on her ideas and her leadership – Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.”  “Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure – our roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater plants.”  “Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country. Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman’s right to choose, workers’ rights, the rights of the LGBT community, the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government’s ability to protect the environment.”  “This election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt, and the many others who cannot afford to go to college. During the primary campaign, Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches. Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less – 83 percent of our population – will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.”  “Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that – unless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near future – there will be more drought, more floods, more acidification of the oceans, more rising sea levels. She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs.”  “Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange. She believes that anyone 55 years or older should be able to opt in to Medicare and she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers.”  “Hillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors, disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine. She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and that drug companies should not be making billions in profits while one in five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need. The greed of the drug companies must end.”  “Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails or incarceration.  In these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up. While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths.”  “I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children.  Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight.”",NewAltWhoThis,2025-05-06T14:14:47,0

Dems tried to push a national minimum wage increase and were blocked by Republicans and a couple conservative Democrats in the Senate.  So instead, both Obama and Biden have worked at the state level to increase minimum wage and all blue and nearly all purple states now have at least a $15/hr minimum wage and/or are increasing theirs to get there and many have it indexed to inflation.  They've done the same thing with marijuana.  Working with states to let them legalize it so there's enough support at the federal level and Congress has come close while Biden decided to change the classification himself which he initiated (but it requires Congress to change the law, he can't actually do much himself since there are laws around classification).  And again, it's all blue and purple and even some red states which now have it legalized medically and/or recreationally because of Obama and Biden.  And that's not to mention the $5 trillion Biden gave lower and middle-income households in his 2 big pieces of legislation (covid relief and infrastucture), the two largest pieces of legislation since The New Deal.

Got the neighbors talking about my Harris Walz yard signs. We needed that campaign to work so badly. And she is an incredible person and candidate.  The number 1 reason we lost to Trump again, putting all of us now in serious danger, is because of the brainwashing that Fox News has done to so many. In the Obama years we should have found a way to explain that they were fiction and not news. Elon Musk buying Twitter and posting falsified videos to 93 million Americans every day about how Biden and Harris were destroying the country didn’t help. That in itself likely swung the election. (Bernie spoke loudly about the danger of allowing people like Bezos and Musk to have so much political power back in 2015/2016)  As for what the Democrats could have done better - they could have taken a lesson from why there was so much enthusiasm for Bernie. I wasn’t **lying** that Hillary’s platform was to do nothing - that was the takeaway from the common person in the country that doesn’t pay much attention to politics like you do and like I do. They didn’t hear anything big that would change for them and so they didn’t see a reason to vote for her.   Similarly - Biden was pretty great, but he didn’t push as hard as possible to do even more to cement in the minds of Americans that the Democrat party is truly fighting for them. Especially now that we were in a post-Trump-presidency world and after the insurrection and how bad things have gotten in Congress, there is so much to fight against and Biden/Harris kept things pretty “back to normal” - that’s how it felt. And that in itself was a big deal! Especially coming out of the pandemic! But most people are too busy working multiple jobs and trying to keep food on the table for their kids. They’re not paying attention to politics. They’re basing their vote or decision not to vote based on their feels.  I am 100% on your side. I want and hope and wish and work to have a nation where all people are respected, free, not worried about being killed for no damn reason, and can get healthcare when they get sick no matter what their financial situation is - like in every other civilized country where the only cost for your doctors’ visits and any procedures you might need is the parking.  As Bernie always says if people starts to chant his name at a rally: “No! It’s not me! It’s us!” The hope is that when enough people wake up, stand up, pay attention, and work together, we are powerful enough to create the government that we deserve.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

"Good Lord, I wouldn’t want a communist revolution! My point, perhaps poorly expressed, was that there’s nothing WRONG with socialism, or liberalism, or populism, or whatever helps the little guy get a leg up and lessens the great inequalities. Creating labels and turning them into ostensible evils is a brainwashing technique that divides in order to conquer.   FDRs policies are still benefitting everyone today, as far as they still exist. I would suggest that non-white, and female led families rely more on social security today than white males, who are more likely to have earned higher salaries and have pensions or other additional retirement plans. And as far as unions are concerned, Nixon and Reagan did more to destroy them than was done at any other time in recent history. Unions were still a force for large segments of the workforce when Reagan took office, and Federal laws gave employees the right to unionize if they wished. Now, half the country has so-called ‘right to work‘ laws that undermine that right. I started my working life under Nixon, and worked at various unionized jobs until 1992. NAFTA was the final nail in the coffin for unions, and things have still gotten steadily worse for most of us.   One problem I keep seeing is that the big, multinational corporations no longer have anyone they need to answer to. If a government tries to rein them in, they just threaten to go elsewhere. They’ve bought enough influence to change laws to their own benefit wherever they wish, no individual country can control them effectively. Science fiction authors warned about that in the 1950s, as did President Eisenhower, a Republican.",Beanie1949,2025-05-07T17:27:15,1

"It is absolutely amazing the total projection from you.  >how did I help Faciests win?  I said why several times. A constant message of ""Democrats aren't pro working class"" while also believing that not being pro working class causes election losses, and being wrong about the former means by your own logic you are helping fascists win.  And even when politicians like Clinton do have progressive pro working class policies, what do you do? Basically say ""they are just lying we can't ever trust their positions"". Wow what sort of voter wants to vote for that? So yes by your own words you are helping Democrats lose which means fascists win.  >(like the one you're painting that I want children in poverty and don't want children to have free lunch).  Ok so then why is Clinton such a ""begrudgement"" for you? If you want children out of poverty why such animosity for a candidate proposing exactly that? It makes NO sense. It would be like if I really wanted M4A and massive taxes on the wealthy but also said ""I'm just forced to vote for Sanders begrudgingly"". It doesn't make any sense. How do you not understand that?  >You guys work with leftists? Really? You have conversations with them? Really? No. You don't. If you did, then you'd also know that free school lunches, family tax credits, and the like are lefty policies. Not the place to attack me, I want all those things (cause they actually mean something to people like me).  Do you not see the total irony? We liberals want the same exact things. They are liberal policies. So why do leftists just attack liberals constantly and our candidates?  Leftists don't have ""conversations"" with liberals and you are just proving it. Everyone who disagrees with you is a ""centrist"" which you know what that word actually means for leftists.  And those things mean something for me. Which is why I support politicians like Clinton who literally wanted to solve all those issues. Again with the projection.  >You guys only go low when it's someone to the left of you, the moment it's someone to the right, boy you want to go hold hands.  It is the left who has constantly said since the election that we need to hold hands with literal Trump voters and blames Democrats for not doing so. Sanders is doing it right here, when liberals have been clear we can win with people who agree with us and don't need Trump voters.  It is absolutely delusional to look at the Harris or Clinton campaign and think they were about holding hands with the right.  >It's pretty sad that instead of campaigning on that,  She did campaign on it. She spent 200 million in advertising, the biggest amount of her total ad spend, on economic issues and her plans. You just didn't care or pay attention. And I thought I had no reason to bring up Harris? You are just confirming why I did.  >she decided to court Republicans who were never going to vote for her  She decided to have a pro democracy message and hoped Republicans would reject Trump because he is a fascist. She didn't try to ""court"" Republicans on policy. And I guess NO one in America liked her? The 80k seat stadiums she filled were actually empty? People liked her and her message and campaign. So why act like no one did?  > and play too nice with the campaign messaging on Trump.  This is objectively a lie. She called Trump a fascist dictator threat a billion times on the campaign. His total disregard for basic democracy was her centerpiece argument. In what universe was she ""nice"" with Trump?  >You guys, never have to do anything, right? Never have to make nice or anything.  We cut child poverty in half under Biden. We passed the largest climate bill in history. The sense of entitlement leftists have like liberals ""never have to do anything"" or ""make nice"" is insane.  >I dont see him going to the White House to make deals  Sanders continually makes excuses for Trump voters  >You guys, well, MLK summed it up real nice (dont worry, no link, but you probably will find a way to feel its meaningless to the conversation):  No idea why you are quoting MLK at me.  I'm not the one saying Trump being a literal fascist is something that can be put off because the ""working class"" feels like they are aggrieved.  That abortion rights need to be put off because some white working class people totally have just concerns about labor or something. That is Sanders and leftists. Continually saying every single harm Trump promised on the campaign and in which Harris spoke at length at about is completely unimportant because the ""working class"" decided it so by voting for Trump and ""you need more than just ""Trump bad"".",silverpixie2435,2025-05-06T13:04:41,0
