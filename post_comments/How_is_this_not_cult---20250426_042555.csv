People will go to great lengths to avoid publicly taking responsibility for bad decisions.  And it's all the easier when you have millions of people who will support your avoidance.  I knew a ton of closet Obama voters in 2008. Including folks who slapped a Bush/Cheney sticker on their car in 2004. I have no doubt that these folks voted for Trump and would turn around and closet-vote for another Democrat if things get bad enough again.,KR1735,2025-04-26T05:55:50,44

Right. These are people who were teachers and blue collar workers in the 70s-90s and have no fucking clue that they would be poor trash with their $25-50k salaries they retired on in 2025.,pastelpixelator,2025-04-26T09:53:21,1
"They also don't realize that the reason it is all made overseas is because Americans do not want to do those jobs for those wages.  It's not about price of goods in this situation, it's a strict cost of labor.    I'm not sure they know what they are fighting for anymore.  It was the republican dream to send jobs overseas to keep a strong dollar.  Cheap non union labor....",No-Kings,2025-04-26T09:12:36,23

I wonder how they would feel about paying more for US goods if a t-shirt cost $50.,Jaws12,2025-04-26T12:51:49,11
"They also don't realize that we don't have the factories to make things we haven't made in decades (or ever). Factories take 7-10 years to build, they don't just magically appear because of tariffs. I would love to ask any one of them ""who's going to invest in building a factory in this uncertainty?"". Also, by the time the factory is built we are out of the supply chain even if you can find Americans to work in that factory for minimum wage. They thought as far ahead as the simpleton they voted for.",russlebush,2025-04-26T21:26:00,5
