“Unsafe Foreign Truckers” want to get out of the business of being unsafe.  I don’t see a problem with that.,mdws1977,2025-05-01T14:06:28,56
"UPS hires contractor truck companies for peak season, and very few of their drivers speak English. Big mix of Spanish and Russian. Dealing with them was a nightmare.",Goongala22,2025-05-01T16:49:21,34
What makes anyone think they can work in a foreign country (in any capacity much less driving a semi) without speaking the language? You couldn't even work in a bar in Italy if you don't speak Italian.,cossbobo,2025-05-01T14:47:01,58

"Obviously we need the strictest safety standards but non US born truckers has been an ongoing trend for years.   I first noticed it when many truck stops were serving Indian food.   I know this trend started when they just couldn't find enough drivers. I don't know if that's still the case but truck are really the backbone of our economy. As is rail.   Personally, if they meet the criteria and are legally here then I don't have an issue with it. It's a tough job and I respect anyone doing it the right way.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-01T19:58:53,12
"Sounds like a potential boom job market opportunity for all those Liberal Arts degree holders who suddenly need to start paying their student loan debts again.   Driving a truck can pay very well, especially compared to Starbucks…..",docholiday999,2025-05-02T05:34:15,5
Can't believe a federal judge hasn't struck this down already what's taking them so long,PastorofMuppets79,2025-05-01T17:07:51,6
"They were driving trucks and they can't speak English?  I hope they sell their rigs. The road signs are in fucking English! I don't want them driving anywhere near me if they can't read ""left lane closed 1/2 mile ahead"" or ""drive slowly, icey conditions ahead""",Typical-Machine154,2025-05-01T16:11:45,1

Imagine the companies that are hiring these people.,jcr2022,2025-05-01T14:50:44,30
"Possibly because it plainly states in a CDL manual that you must be able to read, write, and speak the English language. I believe there needs to be investigations as to how some of these foreigners got their license. There have been cases where a person could ""buy"" a CDL without taking the test.",bulldog522002,2025-05-01T19:34:39,16
Very shady ones. Otherwise there are a lot of regulations. You can just hire a rando off the street.,cossbobo,2025-05-01T14:52:55,20
"They are independent contractors that will hire someone to coordinate loads.  That’s how small trucking companies start. Some person does well enough to buy a second rig, hire on someone to drive, they coordinate their loads taking a cut. Rinse and repeat until they don’t have to drive anymore and just coordinate loads and dispatch.",jacksonexl,2025-05-01T20:28:33,6
It does for sure as I have a CDL. So why did Trump not just say I'm going to enforce this already written law.,PastorofMuppets79,2025-05-01T19:36:27,5
