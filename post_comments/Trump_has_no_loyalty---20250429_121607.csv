Trump has no loyalty to anyone ...except Putin.,Smithy2232,2025-04-29T12:19:37,13
Trump is only loyal to himself. He is the most selfish person you would ever see.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-29T12:27:00,5
"Trump is loyal only to himself, because he's a malignant narcissist. He'd throw his own family under the bus if it benefitted him enough. He loves no one.",LordSiravant,2025-04-29T13:31:07,5
We shouldn't be discussing Trump's loyalty to billionaires. We should be discussing consumer loyalty to those billionaire brands. What does it take for Americans to give up the convenience of Amazon?  Here's a handy static link to [pause your Amazon Prime membership](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GEG9TDENGGVMB453). You can bet Jeff notices the weekly aggregate reports on this.,mzieg,2025-04-29T12:25:47,4

But Bezos and all the other tech bro oligarchs are loyal to Trump. Look at Amazon deciding not to show tariffs in pricing. This is what they paid for!,gjenkins01,2025-04-29T12:51:26,2

"You know who is loyal to his billionaire sycophants? Democratic consumers. They just love all of their convenient amazon junk and amazon prime. If they didn't, amazon as a company would not exist. Democratic consumers are even worse than republican christians when it comes to hypocrisy. ",Bakedads,2025-04-29T12:33:40,-1
I don't know if I would call it loyalty. More like fear of Vladimir releasing the video of him with preteen girls.,zach_doesnt_care,2025-04-29T12:26:42,8
"I would say 'envy' rather than loyalty. Donnie wants to be an oligarch, an equal or superior to Putin, on his own terms, not subservient or obligated to one. As longs as Putin is useful to him, Donnie will continue to use him for his wants. Putin is not likely to allow this but, for now, this is the dynamic that Americans have to deal with.",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-29T12:47:17,3
Trump only believes in power. Bezos made the mistake of not forcibly holding Trump to his word.,rusty_programmer,2025-04-30T06:10:50,1
"He would crash the entire US economy and plunge us into a deep depression for shits and giggles and media attention. He would defund and halt the leading universities’ research on cancer and Alzheimer’s just because he felt slighted by Harvard once. He gets a lot of sadistic pleasure in knifing those who suck up to him; he wants and expects compliance, but he loses respect for those who comply. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-29T14:29:59,1

"Eh. I'm all for people boycotting Amazon, but most of their profit comes from AWS. Good luck boycotting that.   Edit: also, Reddit uses AWS for hosting, for example ",kittenpantzen,2025-04-29T14:51:09,1
Why would he be afraid of that? What would anyone do with that proof?,SniperPilot,2025-04-29T23:19:32,1
