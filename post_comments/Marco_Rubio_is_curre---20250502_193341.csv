I would prefer him to Vance in 2028 tbh.,Scamandrius,2025-05-02T21:51:58,67
Rubio has impressed me as much as any of Trump's cabinet appointments.,SIewfoot,2025-05-02T21:21:35,16

"Heck no, itâ€™s temporary and Marco can manage with the best of them.  Heâ€™ll get things started off right, and when the permanent candidate is on board - handover the baton.  In the mean time he can start the process of department by department recon, get reporting spooled up, begin audits where needed.   Itâ€™ll be cool for the permanent person to show up to a refurb project thatâ€™s already under way.    Itâ€™s better than the old school practice of giving a flunkie the temp position, especially given such a person could end up being one more government official who is absolutely willing to run roughshod over theyâ€™ve actually been tasked to do.",cliffotn,2025-05-02T20:56:09,-71
"If Rubio were Vance's VP, Rubio would be 65 at the end of two Vance terms, still young enough to go for POTUS himself and be 73 after two terms. I'm not sure that Vance would go for anything other than POTUS at this point, so if he's out then he's probably out for good which would seem like a waste based on his performance so far.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-02T23:27:26,-7
"That's a rather odd take, care to expound?",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T22:46:29,15
You're not wrong. Vance is also far more well known and popular with normies than Marco is.,fordr015,2025-05-03T01:42:32,0
In the U.S. history only Kissinger and Rubio had both the State and NSC portfolios.  Is that good enough?,Ask4MD,2025-05-03T13:43:08,6
