"Harvard is a very conservative institution in the true meaning of the word. They have a lot to guard, a lot to conserve. They take their time and carefully collect info, connect dots, they confer and they consider all their options and  reach judicious decisions on what is best for the institution both long and short term. Harvard is the best at being Harvard. Princeton is pretty close. The others follow them.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T16:35:40,8

"They act in whatever way they think is their best interest as an institution, often that means they think in the interest of others because that requires long term thinking and planning. Harvard is constantly setting themselves up to succeed in the future.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-24T05:19:31,1
