I strongly recommend publications like this seek to seat themselves ~~in Avignon~~ overseas and out of legal reach of this bullshit if necessary. I worry that it's that or every single shred of American scientific reputation will end up shredded by the end of this.,darsynia,2025-04-25T14:03:45,13
Does this mean that the NEJM will now publish my article on how all disease is caused by demons? /s,Syzygy2323,2025-04-25T14:42:20,7
Question.  The Trumpet people realize that there are non peer reviewed medical journals right? That what they are supposedly looking for already exists? Just not where they are looking.  Also incredibly what they are talking about is an equal time rule. Which is the opposite of what republicans want in journalism.,[deleted],2025-04-25T14:35:54,3

Surely this has nothing to do with RFK’s mission to blame autism on vaccines.,[deleted],2025-04-25T17:27:32,1
It won't be necessary.  All the researchers will leave the US if this is how it's going to be. They'll live somewhere else and they'll publish in those journals instead. This is how you wipe out a country's technical and scientific advantage.,Lord0fHats,2025-04-25T14:38:37,10
"I want them out of reach of the *suggestion* that they've caved, though. As in, I want the journal's reputation preserved, and if possible, them out of reach of legislative or judicial overreach and retaliation.  And yeah, it's like someone heard the warnings about moving the Department of Agriculture and went 'how do we do that but with the whole country?' (the warnings were that they were setting back agricultural science by decades)",darsynia,2025-04-25T15:07:58,3
