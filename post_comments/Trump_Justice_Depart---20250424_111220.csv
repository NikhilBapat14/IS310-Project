"Yes, banning soldiers who want to be there from being among your ranks. Good plan, dipshit. The military already is suffering recruitment shortages.  Also what is their reasoning for 'impacting military effectiveness' - taking pills isn't hard and ya'll dont need to do injections on the battlefield/on mission. Pills are cheap.",DesignerCorner3322,2025-04-24T11:40:48,10
">The government claims that allowing transgender people with gender dysphoria to serve would impact military effectiveness and **increase health care costs.**  Meanwhile...  >It refers to the amount the Pentagon spends on erectile dysfunction medication annually: about $84m (£63m), according to the Military Times newspaper.  >In contrast, the Rand Corporation think tank estimated last year that gender transition-related health care costs for transgender personnel would increase the military's active duty health budget by $8.4m per year at the most.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40741785",BlotchComics,2025-04-24T11:16:49,16

Can we stop with the distraction talk? A genocide against trans people isn't a distraction. Be serious with how dangerous and evil conservatives are.,Dracogal5,2025-04-24T11:16:56,18
"It is worse than that, because Army intelligence is absolutely fucking chock full of trans people.    Trans people used to join the Armed Forces at a higher rate than other people because the armed forces were a place where people were not allowed to treat them like shit.",Deinosoar,2025-04-24T11:15:27,10
"Seriously I am so sick of the word ""distraction"" on here. This isn't a TV show, it doesn't have a single plotline. Stuff that affects me isn't a distraction from stuff that affects you (or vice versa).   If someone wants to have a single-minded focus for their own advocacy and activism, great. If they want to call for everyone to participate in a specific action, great. But people on here just like to show off that they're too clever to ""fall for it,"" whatever that even means.",pervocracy,2025-04-24T11:28:58,12
"Yes, this issue is serious. Yes, it affects real people. But calling everything a “distraction” isn’t always wrong. It can still be used to shift focus even if it’s harmful and real. These things aren’t mutually exclusive.  And look I get the urgency but throwing around the word “genocide” every time something awful happens kind of waters it down. It’s a heavy word with a specific meaning. If we keep stretching it, people stop listening when it actually applies.",Extension_Court_2754,2025-04-24T13:54:40,-4
"What sucks is that yes, some right wing politicians *are* drumming up hate against trans people as a means to distract from the other ways that they are grifting and cheating the public.  But even if their hate isn't genuine, the threat posed by it is *very real*.  Knowing that it's being driven by cynical motives doesn't change that one bit.  The trans community can't just ignore what is happening to them, and whatever's left of the good part of society shouldn't either.",UnauthorizedUsername,2025-04-24T12:34:47,7
They have literally used dictatorial power through an EO to define us out of existence. Stop trying to argue we haven't crossed the line yet.,Dracogal5,2025-04-24T14:03:54,5
