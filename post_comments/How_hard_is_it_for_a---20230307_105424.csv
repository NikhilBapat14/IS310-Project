"""Sticking to principles"" isn't a very mature way of understanding politicians. Why is Sanders more principled than, say, Biden or Buttigieg or Klobuchar? Simply having more extreme political views or liking less popular things isn't inherently virtuous. Further, from a certain angle, supporting something only because voters ask you to do it kind of does have a certain amount of inherent virtue in democracy.  What this ""money corrupts principles"" thing usually comes down to isn't actually a corruption of principles. People point out how folks get big donations from oil companies and also are not supportive of green initiatives. But establishing a causal link here is actually quite difficult. Put another way, people aren't anti-environmentalist just because oil companies paid them to be, but rather they're anti-environmentalist because they choose to be so, and oil companies like that enough to support those candidates.",mormagils,2023-03-08T08:54:14,3

"I would say a big factor is your base. I've seen politicians who both WIN and publicly reject big donors are from areas that are more progressive than the rest of the country or state, so they can still win an election without the big money.   AOC won an NY district without big money through a lot of her own effort, but also her district is a different scenario than running elsewhere.   Bernie needed to win people state wide. He took a like time to start winning at all bc he was willing to stick to his principles rather than ""flop"" on his ideas in order to win. I believe I remember he lost on local elections multiple times.   There's also the question of what you're willing to sacrifice relative to your opponents. If every single person in the race say for the presidential accwpts billionaire money except for you, you may see that as a disadvantage. If you are not as well known as others, that's another disadvantage   Then there's the revolving door. First, if you get booted out of office, you can get a cushy job at one of your donors places or their connections. This happens very often of someone becoming a board member or exec after leaving office. When a company donates a lot of money, the politician typically feels like they owe something and don't wanna give up that money in the next cycle, especially bc donations are everything in races. Hence, lots of politicians tend to vote in a way ""just happen to"" benefit their donors as well  I've seen a range of politicians from both sides who have different levels of sticking to principles and seen how they differ or change depending on the voter base at hand and the donations at hand   Source: worked in elections",misschickpea,2023-03-07T23:54:53,1
That depends wildly on the district and the candidate.  It's not impossible to avoid being purchased by corporations and vested interests.  It's just easier. I really do think a fair number of politicians go to Washington with good intentions and then are pressured into joining the corruption.,[deleted],2023-03-07T23:59:32,1
"It would require a new American Revolution, but some other countries simply limit the time their politicians can campaign to a couple weeks before an election. Rest of the time they have to actually DO something to get on the news, and if it's not something that pleases their voters, they lose.",Olderscout77,2023-03-08T10:00:14,1
">Most people would perceive, say, Bernies Sanders as sticking to his principles however. Even if you disagree with his views, the man's consistent. I don't know how wealthy his background is, but to run a good presidential campaign you've got to be absurdly wealthy, and that requires... donors. Maybe you can grassroots that with your followers, but is that really enough?  First of all, Bernie Sanders has an incredible PR team. His views have changed quite a bit throughout the years, particularly during his runs for president. So let's make sure we're on the same page about that. When it comes to funding, he did raise a ton of money through grassroots efforts and low-dollar donors. The super PACs who supported him also brought in millions of dollars to boost his name ID. I think it's also worth noting that Sanders broke the all-time record for political campaign finance violations, something like 2500 violations compared to Trump's 300 and Clinton's 0. It's easy to raise money when you ignore the law and the FEC is a toothless organization with no real way to punish you.  To get to the meat of your question, though, /u/ArchdukeAlex8 is basically correct. Every position on every subject has funding sources behind it. If you're pro-gun, you go after gun manufacturer money. If you're anti-gun, you go after gun violence prevention money. The conservative side of this and basically every issue is better funded than the left side, but both sides do still have hundreds of millions of dollars they're willing to invest in candidates.  You also need to consider the personal moral backbone of the specific politician. I worked for a senator running for mayor who used to say, ""I don't care who wants to donate to me, I'll take their money to run my campaign and I won't owe them a single favor in return. That's how it works."" And with him, I do believe he meant that. His principles didn't change depending on who donated to him, but who donated to him did depend on the principles he displayed... unions donated to him, women's rights orgs donated to him, pro-education groups donated to him. Occasionally he'd get a donation from a group that he was totally opposed to (I specifically remember a big billboard company donating) and we'd just laugh it off and take the money and he never felt obligated to return their calls. Ideally that's how it's supposed to work, and while I realize it doesn't always work like that, in my experience as a political consultant that is usually how my candidates viewed finance.   It's hard to explain unless you've worked in the field, but as an ""insider"" who has seen how campaign finance is run, it actually makes perfect sense to me. Basically, there's plenty of money out there for everyone on all sides of every issue.",[deleted],2023-03-08T21:32:51,1
"I wonder how much donors influence politicians, versus how much they donate for views already held by politicians.   For example, the right doesn't vote for gun rights *because* the NRA gives them a lot of money. The left doesn't fight for abortion rights *because* they get funding from Planned Parenthood. Those organizations are donating to their respective sides because those sides are fighting for the causes of those organizations.",waterbuffalo750,2023-03-17T18:47:24,1
"I don't think anything you've said here discredits an inherent level of skepticism we should have with politicians who take substantial amounts of money from industries and proceed to deregulate those industries. Let's not forget how common it is for regulators to end up on the boards of many of the companies they were previously charged with regulating.  Just because the policy came before the money doesn't mean the policy wasn't made FOR the money.  Having more trust or respect that a politician believes what they say when they don't take large money and deregulate whoever they took money from is not only pretty reasonable, it's an obvious conclusion.",yaya-pops,2023-03-15T16:55:44,1
"For a number of issues, it is that simple --- there are well funded pro life and pro choice groups, to pick an obvious example, so all you have to do is fundraise from whatever side you actually believe in.  So for the really big items, like abortion, guns, environmental, and other stuff where you can think of two clear sides, there are usually also two clear sides that will donate.  (In fact, this is how it often works---special interests donate to politicians who *already* believe or support their side.  i.e. you're pro-choice first, and then get support from pro-choice organizations.)  The problem comes when you have lots of money from one side but not much from another --- think big donations from the owners of car dealerships in your district, which are constituents, and influential, but there isn't necessarily a specific group of people who fundraise on behalf of making it slightly easier to get your car repaired at independent auto shops versus dealerships or something.",digbyforever,2023-03-07T21:40:18,3

"No, but the point is that it's not about ""principles"" or personal conduct. There's no evidence that just because something is profitable, it must be non-genuine. Just because something in profitable doesn't make it virtuous, and just because something is profitable doesn't make it suspect.",mormagils,2023-03-15T20:45:15,1
