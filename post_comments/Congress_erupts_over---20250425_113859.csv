"CALL A DUCK A FUCKING DUCK  This is a fascist regime unchecked by Congress or the Courts. Fuck the GOP and all of the fascists that voted for this.   Edit: I’m done responding to people defending fascism. An administrative warrant is not the same thing as a Judge warrant for arrest. ICE does not have jurisdiction to walk into a state courthouse and start arrest people. Even if they have an actual warrant for someone’s arrest. They routinely arrest people outside of courthouses, the arrest isn’t the issue. It’s the blatant fascist overreach of using some bullshit Trump up charges from an invalid arrest attempt to then arrest a judge over an offense that amounts to a $1,000 fine.   If you’re defending this you would also have defended the Gestapo arresting judges for helping Jews. You little geese can fuck off. ",SpicyButterBoy,2025-04-25T12:12:12,2106
"In light of this FBI arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan, I believe our system of checks and balances is fundamentally broken when one party controls all three branches of government.  The Republican-controlled Congress has no incentive to investigate questionable actions by a Republican executive branch, demonstrating Lord Acton's principle that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" Our founders, while wary of political factions, never anticipated how party loyalty would overrule branch loyalty and disable the oversight mechanisms they created.  I propose that minority parties should have full rights to open investigations regardless of their numbers in Congress - this isn't about partisanship but about preserving the constitutional principle of checks and balances that protects us all from unchecked power, regardless of which party holds control.",jmcdono362,2025-04-25T11:49:22,2390

"""Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It’s not so bad' or 'You’re seeing things' or 'You’re an alarmist.'  And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.""  -Milton Sanford Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45*",pleasedothenerdful,2025-04-25T13:06:06,35

"One other thing is worth pointing out.  Typically, when DOJ makes an arrest and releases a statement or gives a press conference, they stick to the facts.

Any semblance of an independent apolitical DOJ is long gone.  So many norms are being upended that it’s difficult to keep track of all of them.

On that day, Dugan “became visibly angry” after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case, according to a [sworn affidavit](https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2025/04/25/DuganCriminalComplaint.pdf) unsealed Friday.  Dugan and another judge entered the hallway and confronted the arrest team, telling one deportation officer that he needed a judicial warrant to make an arrest instead of an “administrative warrant.” Dugan then ordered them to the chief judge’s office, the affidavit alleged.  After returning to her courtroom, Dugan “escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel” through a jury door, which leads to a nonpublic area of the building, the affidavit stated, citing “multiple witnesses.”  Flores-Ruiz and his attorney then returned to the hallway and took an elevator down to leave the building, the special agent alleged. After being told that Flores-Ruiz was in front of the courthouse, agents ran toward him and identified themselves as law enforcement officers.  “Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued,” according to the affidavit.  “The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained,” it alleged.

"People aren’t understanding what happened here. But hear me out, it’s actually bad in other ways:  A lot of people here assume the title means a judge who has ruled against what the AG wants has decided to arrest Judge Dugan for that. Not true.  She allegedly hid a person in her private chambers to avoid federal agents who had a warrant to arrest the person. (This is what you’ll see reported on FoxNews, by the way.)  While technically true, she was 100% in the constitutional right to do this (with precedence!). First, and this is key, this was an administrative warrant, not a federal warrant. Administrative warrants aren’t signed by a judge, just an ICE employee. While the state can’t cancel or stop this warrant (because it is a federal, not state, warrant) they can still control what happens in their courthouse. This includes refusing to allow ICE to arrest someone without a federal warrant while on any courtroom property.  They could return and present a federal warrant, and at that point I’m sure Dugan would accept the rule of law and allow the arrest regardless of location.  Why I feel this is more dangerous in some ways than what’s assumed to have happened. Granted, arresting any judge for not ruling how you like would be the #1 worst-case scenario. The two really bad things that did actually happen are they showed they’re going about this selectively and smartly and not all crazy willy-nilly like everyone on Reddit thinks. They have only been selecting “grey….ish sounding” battles to fight. (i.e., an undocumented person who had a deportation order still standing but a CAT order had been issued overriding the order even if still standing.) This Judge Dugan arrest shows to me they are being careful and picking steps they can test before standing on. (Project 2025 has smart people behind it and I really think they are writing the briefs on all the AG stuff.) This case not only sounds like the judge was acting politically and breaking the law on the surface but she was actually defending the state right to be free from federal interference (this person has a pending criminal case). By attacking this they can erode each individual state’s protection from the feds doing what they want there.  By showing careful selection of this situation and the implications of state rights, I feel this is almost as dangerous as a judge getting arrested for opposing this admin.  I am not a lawyer. I do follow this sort of thing and I do my research if I’m not familiar with an aspect.

Troy Nehls (R-Texas), a staunch Trump ally, told Axios he, too, supports the arrest, exclaiming, ""Lock em up!!"" * Said Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.): ""If she broke the law, she needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. No double standards.""""  Clicking through the article.   ""Flores-Ruiz was scheduled for a hearing on April 18 in a criminal case in Dugan's courtroom, the complaint states. ICE agent went to the courthouse with an administrative arrest warrant and planned to take him into custody in a public area outside the courtroom after his appearance before the judge.  * When Dugan learned ICE agents had come with an administrative warrant, rather than a judicial warrant, she told them to go speak to the chief judge, per the complaint.  * During that time, Dugan allegedly took Flores-Ruiz through a juror door and out of the court room, witnesses said according to the FBI's complaint. * Agent later arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse.""",[deleted],2025-04-25T15:41:28,1

Reminds me of an old saying.. with ignorant peasants you can't have a revolution.. the reason I say this is because we must not be teaching people enough history from the past such as Nazi Germany and the things that led up to it. I also say we should be teaching more of civics and how government is supposed to work when done properly maybe everyone would appreciate democracy and our freedoms a lot more.. I know my father my grandfather and his grandfather and father fucked for Independence and freedom and our freedoms and they would be rolling over in our Graves to see what this jackass of a president is doing and the Congress is doing.. have about decided we should eliminate both parties and just have straight up vote for the one person one vote. No electoral college etc etc. And while I'm at it another thing this business with IRS.. the only way to make people pay taxes properly is that the cash register get rid of an income tax charge some subliminal tax I don't know 10 cents on a dollar or less.. the reason this would be good is because it's a simple math calculation done at the cash register at which point the states would collect the money and send it up to the federal government for the dispersionary purposes it wishes to do.. I believe it would be a lot simpler no exemptions. That means people with money when they spend it or whatever it is and I mean whatever it is they pay a tax that tax collect about States sent up to the federal government we eliminate a whole lot of jobs that are required to give all these exemptions that we have to take to survive Maybe I'm Wrong feedback is appreciated I'm always listening and I'm open-minded but we've got to get this clown under control and the Congress needs to wake up and smell the roses because they can go just like any judge or anybody else and it will happen to them because he turns on everybody. Okay that's my two cents worth for the day I hope things get better for you I hope things get better for me and I don't sure hope things get better for the United States you know the ones that have the Constitution that's supposed to be followed.. it's not America it's not let's make America again how about let's live up to the US Constitution as it is written it doesn't take a brain surgeon you read it it's pretty simple. Our forefathers even had the sense to know they were going to be things they didn't foresee coming such as electric and the Technologies but they had the sense to make it where we could change it as a people not a person not a tyrant not a king as a people a group of people. And people let's get ourselves together and that's right like the democracy I know it can be. You know originally all those laws are written to stop tyranny and kings and treasonous acts and wow what happened to the laws we followed I just can't believe what's happening in my lifetime I know that my family members that are long past would be rolling over in their graves and I thought I would never ever see this in the United States. That's why we don't have dictators we don't have authoritarian governments we don't have a lot of things that would make your life miserable every doggone day. I appreciate you listening to me I needed to vent a little bit but think about it we were once the strongest Nation and best Nation probably in the world and now we're a laughing stock of the world due to tariffs which by the way help start the Great Depression as well as the stock market.. there's another place we need to get rid of some lobbyists and the like. You have to start buying time with a present with memes that is clearly conflict of interest and you see somebody like Elon Musk coming in saying this trash that's trash everything's trash and it's all lies when you go back and double check it and nobody does anything about it but yet they destroy things from the inside out can't you see this people I mean I'm not the most brain in the world but doggone and I'm not blind either and when I'm wrong or if I voted for somebody wrong I would sure want to change it.. I can say I didn't vote for anybody wrong and would never vote for anybody wrong or treasonous or a known felon or chronic liar I mean the list goes on and a narcissist where does it stop what does it take for people to understand the difference between right and wrong and to do the right thing not the wrong thing they don't realize they're killing themselves in the process all because they were promised things that they're never going to get in this term especially if he gets in on another term after this you know there's reasons we limited the number of times a president can be in office and it was a good reason look it up.. please take your time to read the Constitution as it's written and I do not think you will have too hard of a time understanding it unless maybe you can't read. Which goes back to the fact that I say with ignorant peasants you can't have a revolution if people have not seen a better and brighter way to do things then they don't know any better and they're happy and content living in squalor and tyranny etc etc etc the rich get richer you have no chance of having a better life because they don't care about you can't you figure that out yet it's all about the money money in their pockets not ours why are we giving these high-dollar people these tax breaks why there's at least people in the world that need them trickle down economics has been proven not to work over and over again are you this dumb or can you not read and check out things like that I mean my goodness don't listen to me go check it out take a few minutes out of it life of yours and do some checking and reading you'll make your own deductions you can't be that program to not understand the difference between right and wrong. Okay I bored you enough so I'm going to shut up for now but I needed to vent I think you should read and make your own decisions I hope they're the right ones I won't be around much longer so it doesn't really matter but you may be young you may have to live with it the rest of your life and trust me 80 or 90 years seems like a long time but when you get into that last stretch of life it's not time enough and you really are too old to do anything about it except try your best that's all I ask of you anyway have a great day everyone I'm going to try and do the same though it may not work out that way at least in my heart I know that I tried.,Organic-Dinner8983,2025-04-26T14:09:48,1

"Judge Dugan simply asserted her authority as a member of the Judicial Branch of our government, confronting ICE and pointing out they had a defective warrant (Administrative warrant NOT a Judicial warrant) which could not be lawfully enforced at her court. She then lawfully allowed the defendant's attorney to escort him from the courtroom.    And now Trump wants to arrest her for obstruction of Justice.     - How many kids did Trump rape with Epstein, who he had murdered in custody while waiting to testify?     - How many thousands of documents did Trump steal and then lie to the FBI about having at Mar-a-Lago?  - How many felonies was Trump convicted of?   - How many millions was Trump directed to pay a victim the court found him liable for rape and defamation?   - How many people died as a direct result of Trump's attempted coup on January 6th?

You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It’s not so bad' or 'You’re seeing things' or 'You’re an alarmist.'  And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.""  -Milton Sanford Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45*",pleasedothenerdful,2025-04-25T13:05:32,9

"Sounds like she directed the immigrant to exit the court room in a manner that would not be visible to the agents, so it's more than just that she directed the agents away - she then took an active role in assisting the person to avoid arrest.  It will be interesting to hear the other side of the story. Directing the agents to see the chief judge seems reasonable. If that led to the person passively taking that opportunity to avoid arrest it also seems like you couldn't say the judge ""helped"". But the active part of directing them towards an exit the agents were not monitoring is problematic. It may depend on the judge having another plausible reason for that (or contesting the facts of it). I could see the judge arguing that they decided to adjourn proceedings because the pending arrest compromised the ability to conduct proceedings in a fair manner.

"As if the democrats were leftists in any meaningful sense, save for a handful of them.  The democratic party is right wing.  Forty-plus years of shifting the center has obviated even the marginal gains made by center-leftists during the 1960s and 1970s.    The dems buy into right wing rhetoric - whether that is DEI ""being racist"" or as in the case of one of my state senators (Slotkin), talking about how dems need ""alpha energy"" (bunch of Andrew Tate-level horseshit) and that they need to stop being ""so woke"".    It's depressing that the so-called opposition party takes on faith this kind of dumb bullshit.  It plays right into republican hands.

Saddam called an emergency council session and the party members showed up not knowing what to expect. You can see party members joking and making small talk with each other as the session begins.  Muhyi, secretary of the former Iraqi President, was forced to confess to a conspiracy against the Ba'ath party.  After Muhyi's confession Saddam took the podium and said he was going to start naming people, and when he named them he wanted them to stand up say the party slogan and then leave the room, then he took a seat behind a desk filled with microphones and started naming people one by one.  As he lists off the names, the named party stands and speaks, the first few just sit back down after speaking, but later military guards come into the council chambers and escort the named out of the chamber.  Party members start looking around in confusion, and fear.  As more and more names were listed, party members started spontaneously standing up yelling *Long live Saddam Hussein*. Saddam smiles and smokes a cigar.  All 68 were tried as a group and found guilty of treason. 22, including Muhyi, were sentenced to execution. 21 were executed. 1 escaped because he was tipped off ahead of time and avoided the emergency session.  Some of the 46 that were not sentenced to execution were forced to perform the executions of the other 21.",Consistent-Law9339,2025-04-25T15:00:40,388

"I asked ChatGPT to overlay Trump’s presidency with Saddam Hussein’s regime and here is what it came up with - I didn’t mention anything about judges being arrested…  ——  U.S. Timeline: The Trump Regime (2025–2049)  An authoritarian state rises from the ashes of American democracy  2025 – Return to Power & Emergency Rule Trump returns to the presidency after a disputed election marred by voter suppression and coordinated legal obstruction. He declares a National Emergency for Electoral Integrity, citing mass fraud without evidence.  Within months, Trump suspends key civil rights and places the Department of Justice and FBI under direct executive oversight. Independent federal judges are removed or arrested on charges of corruption. Loyalist governors and senators are installed in key battleground states.  2026 – The MAGA Purge Trump stages a public loyalty ceremony at a Republican National Convention-turned-""National Unity Summit."" During the event, several prominent Republicans (former critics) are accused of treason. They are escorted out by federal security forces and later “disappear.”  This mirrors Saddam’s 1979 purge, where Ba'ath Party members were forced to name fellow “conspirators” before being executed.  Dozens of former political allies, governors, military leaders, and media personalities are arrested under new ""Patriot Acts"" for ""undermining the American spirit."" Secret tribunals sentence them to death or life imprisonment.  2027–2030 – Institutionalised Terror The Department of Homeland Security becomes the Department of National Protection, enforcing loyalty with impunity. A vast network of secret detention centres—modelled on ICE facilities but expanded—are used to detain dissidents, journalists, academics, and minority activists.  Mass graves are found years later in the deserts of Arizona and Utah, containing the bodies of undocumented immigrants, Muslim Americans, and left-wing protesters. The regime blames “rogue elements.”  Surveillance becomes total. Religious minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals are subjected to police harassment and extrajudicial punishment. Like Saddam’s brutal use of secret police and torture, Trump’s regime disappears thousands.  2031 – Trump Dies, But the Regime Survives Trump dies suddenly in his sleep at Mar-a-Lago. State media mourns ""The Last American President"" for weeks. A cult of personality explodes, with his embalmed body placed in a golden tomb dubbed the Sanctuary of Liberty in Washington, D.C.  His death is used to justify The Transition Charter, placing executive power in the hands of a Supreme National Council, led by Ivanka Trump and Stephen Miller. The council rules collectively but brutally, ensuring the continuation of Trumpist ideology.  2032–2038 – Cultural Genocide & Internal War The regime launches a campaign against so-called ""Anti-Americans"" in California, Chicago, and the Pacific Northwest. Similar to Saddam’s Anfal campaign against the Kurds, Trump’s regime uses drones, cluster bombs, and chemical agents to quell resistance.  Entire cities are flattened under the guise of fighting domestic terrorism. San Francisco becomes a ghost city after being shelled during the Western Insurgency.  Ethnic cleansing begins in border states: Hispanic communities are forcibly relocated inland. Native American tribes are stripped of land rights and placed in ""protection zones.""  2039 – The Texan Rebellion A failed coup by conservative military generals in Texas—once staunchly loyal to Trumpism—sparks the Texan Rebellion. The regime's response is devastating: Austin is bombed, over 80,000 civilians are killed, and the survivors are rounded up in detention camps.  The regime uses the Trump Broadcast Network (TBN) to claim the rebellion was a foreign plot backed by Canada and ""European Socialists."" This mirrors Saddam’s repression of Shi’a uprisings and his mass reprisals.  2040–2045 – Total Collapse of the American Dream The U.S. dollar collapses under international sanctions. The country is diplomatically isolated. Black markets and foreign-controlled supply chains keep cities barely functioning.  Paranoia intensifies. The regime begins purging its own members. Don Jr. has allies of Ivanka executed after a failed assassination attempt. The government, now fractured, collapses into rival factions.  Like Iraq in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the regime is economically broken, diplomatically isolated, and internally chaotic—but still violently clinging to power.  2049 – The Regime Falls A coalition of states led by a reconstituted Pacific Confederacy (California, Oregon, Washington) launches a coordinated rebellion. Federal buildings are stormed, and mass protests turn into full-scale revolution.  Ivanka is found in a bunker under Trump Tower and captured. Don Jr. is killed by his own security detail. Survivors of the regime are put on trial for crimes against humanity, with evidence presented of forced sterilisation, political executions, and mass torture.  A Truth and Reconciliation Commission is established to document the regime’s atrocities. The Third American Republic is formed in 2050.",twhoff,2025-04-25T18:56:03,2

In other words, to what level was Judge Dugan obligated to ensure that the proper procedures were followed in a state court (IE the administrative warrant properly being executed in a *public* location) and what potential implications could a failure to do-so have not only on the state/county's liability, in addition to what impact these could have had on a defendant being improperly served during a court hearing *which is not a normal part of a county/state hearing*, but also the matters of her court room that she was being impeded from fulfilling and what jurisdiction individuals had in those areas *once she was made aware of their intent*.

You know every single SCOTUS judge after their 10yrs is up will move to some corporate private sector job in lobbying or similar. The entire reason we have lifelong judicial appointments is to avoid this and that issue is a very real concern that we don’t want to entertain.

Being from italy the thing that gets me the most about the American system is that it considers the judiciary to be an independent branch while at the same time placing federal prosecutors under the executive. Our constitution considers both prosecutors and judges as part of the judicial branch that is constitutionally fully independent. Judges and prosecutors are not elected but nominated after passing specific exams. Members of higher jurisdictions are elected by the same judiciary. Moreover police are considered as working directly under the direction of public prosecutors so it is unthinkable for the executive to disobey a decision because this is literally impossible.,Gedfile,2025-04-25T18:26:58,3

I mean it’s like saying you can work on the mathematics team that’s probably going to win a Nobel Prize but then you have to quit mathematics - a lot of the best and brightest at the highest levels just couldn’t give up their work like that because it’s not only their work it’s their passion too.

"Self-preservation incentives and historical precedent are good points. The Nixon example is particularly telling - congressional Republicans ultimately chose country over party when faced with clear executive overreach. What concerns me today is the apparent breakdown of this institutional self-preservation instinct.  While I agree that individual character matters enormously, I believe we need structural guardrails that don't depend solely on the courage of politicians. We now understand that the guardrails were written with the expectation that our politicians would enforce and respect them using good faith. That tradition is gone.  The founders created separation of powers assuming institutional loyalty would come before personal or partisan interests, but didn't anticipate how party discipline could override this.  The arrest of a judge for a courtroom decision strikes at judicial independence in ways that should alarm everyone regardless of party. My proposal for minority party investigation powers isn't about undermining the majority but rather creating a consistent check that functions regardless of which party controls what branches. After all, power inevitably changes hands, and the protections we establish when our ""team"" is vulnerable will benefit us all when the tables turn. Wouldn't Republicans have wanted these powers during unified Democratic control, and vice versa?",jmcdono362,2025-04-25T12:07:43,36

"The closest analogy to a true worst-case-scenario would be for America to descend into something akin to Colombia's [_""La Violencia""_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Violencia), a ten-year long medium-intensity civil war, which saw an extremely corrupt but democratically elected right-wing government lose the ability to exercise control over most rural areas (which fell under control of left-wing rural paramilitaries), or adequately handle paramilitary violence and rioting in most cities (where right-wing militias ran unchecked; in part because much of the government sympathized with said paramilitaries). The failure to contain the violence ultimately resulted in a military coup which saw Colombia transform into a full-blown dictatorship for several years. The dictator was able to successfully bring an end to most of the violence, but suspended the great majority of civil liberties. After it became clear that the military dictator wasn't going to leave willingly, massive protests engulfed the country, which led to other military officials forcing the dictator to step down, and initiating [an 18-year program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(Colombia\)) to very gradually restore the country to democracy, which was ultimately successful, but took an extremely long time during which freedoms were still somewhat restricted, and Colombia became inundated with the drug cartels (most famously that of Pablo Escobar) that developed out of the remnants of the extremist paramilitaries.  Wikipedia article about it is pretty barebones but unfortunately there's not any particularly detailed overview of the conflict written in English.   A perhaps more likely, but still very bad scenario, would be for America to descend into something more akin Italy's _[""Years of Lead""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead)_, a 20 year period in which far-left and far-right paramilitary organizations were able to routinely conduct attacks on eachother, carry out terrorist attacks, and arrange the kidnappings or assassinations of the politicians they hated most. The wiki article for this is **MUCH** better than the article for La Violencia, and I think it provides quite a good overview.   There are key differences between the things that caused these civil wars vs. the current situation in America but I believe it is still important that Americans concerned about America's current trajectory to become familiar with both, as to get a more realistic idea of where we may be headed if we fail to adequately foil the authoritarian plans of Trump and his allies. 60s Italy and 40s Colombia had political cultures **far** more similar to modern America than either 30s Germany or 90s Russia. And as such, both La Violencia and the Years of Lead are infinitely more relevant to America's current crisis than the more common comparisons to Nazi Germany or Putin's Russia.",p00bix,2025-04-25T15:46:36,10

Specifically:  Obstruction of a Federal Proceeding [\(18 U.S.C. § 1505\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and [Concealing a Person from Arrest \(18 U.S.C. § 1071\).](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1071)  Here is some other relevant case law:  1. [United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411 \(1976\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/423/411.html) Holding: Public places do not require a judicial warrant for an arrest, even if the arrest is based on probable cause. Her insistence that a judicial warrant was required was incorrect and obstructed lawful enforcement.  2. [INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210 \(1984\) ](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/466/210.html) Holding: Routine questioning or immigration enforcement in public workspaces is permissible without a judicial warrant. ICE was within its rights to attempt enforcement in the public setting.  3. [Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 \(1980\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/445/573/) Holding: A judicial warrant is required to enter a private home to make an arrest — but NOT for public areas.  Only after Flores Ruiz exited into private/restricted areas would a judicial warrant become necessary. Before that, her insistence on one (not to mention her aiding his escape) obstructed the lawful performance of ICE officers’ duties.  You're talking about separation of powers and due process and conflating things that have nothing to do with his arrest.  Mr. Eduardo Flores-Ruiz is a Mexican national with no legal status to be present in the United States. He was previously deported in 2013 and re-entered the U.S. which constitutes a federal offense under [8 U.S.C. § 1326](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1326).

Agents approached him on the street outside the courthouse. “A foot chase ensued,” the complaint said. “The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse” before catching and arresting him, the complaint said.

"To be fair, there is a *literal* double standard.  Most of the cases you hear of people being prosecuted for stuff like this are because they're violating the UCMJ. The rules for soldiers mishandling classified materials are **far** more stringent than the rules for civilians.  Soldiers can, and have, been prosecuted for simply misplacing classified material because negligence is criminal under the UCMJ. While *gross* negligence is technically criminal under federal law, in practice it has never been charged and almost certainly would fail if charged due to a series of standing precedents.  This, incidentally, was part of why Clinton and Biden were never charged. Because even if you argue they were grossly negligent civilian law only really covers intentional violations. This was why Trump **was** charged, because he knowingly violated the law as evidenced by the cover up.  As for Hegseth? Their running argument is that US war plans aren't classified.

Republican legislators are fine giving up their power to the president because it furthers their republican goals even if it weakens their individual power as legislators.   Traditionally the legislation has fought against giving power to the executive, not on moral grounds but to protect their own power and interests.

In about 2-3 weeks Americans will finally be feeling the consequences of tariffs at which point public opinion will further drop. Acts like arresting judges and sending people off to foreign prison camps don’t have as an apparent window of when it will affect our every day lives but it soon will.   Too many Americans seem believe bad things from government overreach can’t happen to them even as they watch events unfold from a distance getting closer and closer. By and large it seems like a profound failure in modeling a realistic future within their minds. ,somethingsomethingbe,2025-04-25T12:30:56,14

SCOTUS' ability to review constitutionality is itself a result of a contentious battle (Marbury v. Madison) in the earliest days of the country.

We also have a Congress that successfully blocked a supreme Court nomination.    The system has failed, the people elected have long since abandoned the constitution.  I think that's why Reddit is surprised at the support Trump still has....  Many people want the federal government reduced overall and powers granted back to the states.    It's just a mess, a long time building.  My knowledge of history leads me to believe the right wing elements will simply seize the whole apparatus, which we see before us.  The dreams of libertarians will go unfulfilled, the federal power will only grow with authoritarianism.  This will probably lead to sectarian violence.  And with the state of the environment itself faltering, we really don't have time to work these issues out.  I would put my money on total worldwide systematic collapse in the next thirty years.  Yay",brontosaurusguy,2025-04-25T14:31:51,1

And she walked him into another non public spot post adjournment, connected to her courtroom. Where he then proceeded to exit into the same hallway the agents were waiting for him in. Was seen by two, then entered an elevator where there was another waiting, and was arrested once in public space outside where they had the authority to do so. So my point, is that she didn't obstruct anything. She has judiciary authority in her court room, if she needs to have a discussion with a defendant or attorney post trial she has the right to go into that room and sign a paper, schedule the next one, whatever. There is no recording of what was said, there is nothing that suggests it was illegal or that she warned him to get out or anything bc he literally did not hide in there, exited into the same hallway he was expected, and was arrested .

"> Well, if you look at the project 2025 tracker under the department of labor section here, you'll see that unions won't matter at some point...   I'd like to present the argument that unions were actually more powerful prior to the NLRB, specifically because the stakes involved in negotiations were immensely higher and there wasn't baked in labour complacency due to institutional state legitimacy.   ""Labour peace"" and ""industrial pluralism"" has hurt unions because it's made them complacent and allowed institutional corruption to rot throughout them because state recognition and certification becomes the most important priority.   Rather ironically to Project 2025, destruction of the NLRB will actually make unions more valuable and consequences of failed deals way more violent.

"I disagree with the judges arrest. The legal complaint doesn't assert probable cause in my opinion. Her questions, anger, initially stating they needed a judicial warrant despite it only actually being needed in SOME areas of the courthouse (when she hadn't even been told where they planned to make the arrest anyways....) none of that is an obstruction to the arrest. Especially because at the time of this discussion Eduardo was sitting in a courtroom where a judicial warrant WOULD BE needed to arrest him. But once the administrative warrant was explained she no longer asserted a judicial warrant was needed. She actually just asked to see the administrative warrant, and it wasn't shown to her. So she told the officer to go speak to the Chief Judge about it and went back to her courtroom. Requesting some general admin to ensure ICE isn't overstepping, after years of it just being considered common law to not arrest people in courthouses, should be expected from a branch considered coequal to the executive and responsible for checking it's power. Not to mention someone had just come into that judges courtroom and announced 'ICE is here' out loud... others in the courtroom were discussing, other court employees were becoming distracted--it was having an impact on her courtroom, even if they weren't physically inside of it.   When the agent did speak to the chief judge, he asked for clarification on the public areas. Great, responsible. Judge says yes hallways are ok, tells him where not to make an arrest, asks to see the warrant, makes a copy. Cool. Perfectly reasonable. No crimes thus far. Then there's statements about the judge retuning, gesturing, speaking with people, walking through a door with Eduardo and his attorney, and returning to her bench. She confirmed to someone later that the hearing was adjourned. Could be for any reason, misfiled paperwork, the request of an uncomfortable witness, a hostile or unsafe environment..... but it's convininently left out of the legal complaint. ICE's interests do not take away any of her judiciary power in this sceanrio, and every judge has the right to adjourn when something impedes on the court's ability to offer a fair and just trial. If most people in the courtroom are now aware ICE is here, and those involved in the case (defendant, witnesses, translator, clerk, judge) are fearful, intimidated, distracted, etc. to the point where it can be reasonably argued as having an impact on the case, it is no longer a fair trial. A simple and foundational concept of how courtrooms work.  So what's left in terms of committing a crime--going into a non-public room attached to her courtroom with an ajourned defendant and their attorney? Even though her prior actions have clear justification that can be proven as independently valid, so this point now stands on it's own? There could be any number of possibilities for using that room, needing to discuss post adjourned trial things before he left, scheduling, providing paperwork, anything. We're not familiar with this damn door. But we do know it lead him right back out to the same hallway as the other one. Where the defendant was immedietly seen by two agent. And where he then proceeded to enter an elevator WITH ANOTHER ICE AGENT already inside. And was then arrested upon exiting the elevator into a public space. ICE quite literally accomplished what they went there to do, arrest the guy once he was in a place where they had the authority to do so. And they did. Yet the arrest was apparently obstructed and a criminal was concealed.... Hm. Okay. right. Even if the legal complaint frames everything with vague speculation and tacks negative adjectives in front of every action taken by the judge, it doesn't disguise the fact that it's just fluff. It doesn't change how weak the logic is.   If you want to send me another case reference for this one please make sure it actually includes a precedent that would apply here, precedent considers how similar the facts of the case are not just the ruling itself.",digitalgloss,2025-04-25T20:36:16,1

"Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf in 1925 “the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated”. In 1933 Jews were banned from government, political, medical, teaching, and other jobs. In 1935 Jews were stripped of citizenship and forbidden from marrying “aryans”. In 1938 kristallnacht happened which led to synagogues and Jewish businesses being burned down, hundreds of dead Jews, and many more arrested. In 1939 mass killings and the rounding up of Jews began in Poland. The holocaust is considered to have started in 1941. So yeah, I’d say there were plenty of signs that being Jewish in Nazi controlled areas was bad for your health.
