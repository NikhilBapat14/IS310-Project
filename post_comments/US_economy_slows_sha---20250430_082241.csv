"Here are the most important parts:   >The decline in GDP was attributed primarily to an increase in imports, which count as a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, as well as a decrease in government spending. Those shifts were partially offset by increases in investment, consumer spending and exports.  The media will predictably overlook most of these points. Continued strength in consumer spending, increase in investment, and decrease in government spending. All of those are good things.

"Which no economist takes seriously. China's real economy has not grown since at least 2005. Alternative economic comparisons like energy consumption, night time illumination, or consumer wealth show China's economy is 40 to 60% smaller than official GDP. How can this be? Currency controls and financial manipulation used to maintain full employment. Remember even the Soviet Union showed robust economic growth even as scarcity for everything worsened and the economy collapsed. 3% Soviet economic growth right up to the end. A government managed economy can do this easily with bottomless subsidies and it is a foolproof plan right up until it collapses.   For comparison the United States banking sector is about 100% of US GDP, China's about 350%. The CCP has walled off their domestic economy from the rest of the world with a two currency system blocking capital outflows and using forced currency exchange to transfer foreign currency wealth to itself instead of the Chinese people.

It is chaos, and we will pay for it.  If they don't come up with something consistent pretty soon, we'll end up with a Democrat controlled Congress in 2026, and any hopes of Trump doing anything again will be over.  Hopefully there's one actual conservative economist in the administration that can talk some sense into our leaders.  >Has anyone actually been feeling any real economic hit from this, outside of stock-obsessed tech bros? I certainly haven't, and I doubt most average people have either.  Tariffs take about three months to start hitting us at home.  They don't cover goods in transit or in warehouses, so we won't be seeing the effect until the middle of May.  The only effects we've seen now is the slowing economy, a stock market that has lost trillions in value, increased government spending, and promises of big government bailouts already coming from the White House.",cathbadh,2025-04-30T15:36:27,24
