We are far from hitting the bottom and the Trump flip flop dance is not helping. Other countries are moving on.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T13:59:16,20
Consumer expectations are accurate. ,SubstantialTennis537,2025-04-25T13:58:55,11
Get ready for empty shelves. I remember Covid and empty stores. This is going to be worse.,morbob,2025-04-25T14:08:22,6
"I’m an anecdotal example of the consumer described here. I am not a big spender anyway but now I’m having to forego even the smallest purchases including soda, meat, and new clothes. I am trying to set aside as much money as possible for the inevitable Trump recession.",RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-25T14:11:09,4
"The problem is that we don’t fund education enough. Because when I went to school, they taught us how everything works. And the president has nothing to do with the price of eggs or gas. Now trump has figured out how to make prices go higher! I mean I guess he’s a genius? He could have literally taken office and played golf for 4 years and everyone would have said that he was the greatest president ever? Nope felon and his chainsaw, flip flopping on a daily basis about tariffs and not having a clue about how to run the country will be the disaster that most of us saw coming.",nopulsehere,2025-04-25T14:54:06,2

We're getting a bit of an artificial boost from people rushing to replace cars and electronics a bit earlier than they planned to avoid tariff price raises. It will be downhill once tariffs are in place.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-25T15:12:50,1
More golf in Joisy after the Pope’s funeral. Guaranteed we will see him batshit bored /annoyed at the Vatican. ,Express_Ticket1699,2025-04-25T15:42:05,1
They're probably too high.,account312,2025-04-25T15:25:29,3
Yup. I stocked up on what I could before the inauguration.,act17,2025-04-25T14:17:33,4
