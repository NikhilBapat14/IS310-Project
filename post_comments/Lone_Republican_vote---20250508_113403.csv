"Yes and no.  It's not like anything has a ""real"" name - it's just whatever we humans call it by. So it's all kind of made up and arbitrary.  Obviously one country can't make the other country refer to something by the same name. But they do generally standardize what things are called by the government. As such, the US does have the [Board on Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names) and other countries have equivalent bodies ([Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_Names_Board_of_Canada), for example). The [UN also has a similar body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Group_of_Experts_on_Geographical_Names).  If the US calls it the Gulf of America, it's doubtful anyone else will. But disputes where the same thing is called different things by different countries is hardly unprecedented - the [Sea of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Japan_naming_dispute), for example, is the widely recognized name by everyone except for South Korea, which instead calls it the East Sea. There's a whole lot of other [disputed names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geographical_naming_disputes) as well.  To be clear, the whole thing of wanting to call it the Gulf of America is really fucking stupid.  But the process of how official names are decided upon and get standardized both nationally and internationally is actually [really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWztO3Hbt-M) if you're the sort of person who finds esoteric bureaucratic processes interesting.",ejp1082,2025-05-08T16:36:42,25

"You can see how each person voted [here](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025122).  All members of Congress aren't at DC all of the time. They'll only all be there when it's necessary. At other times, they'll be away for various reasons such as private things like attending weddings, vacation, etc. or public things like returning home to visit with constituents.  They'll only stay in DC to block a bill for *really* important things. The minority party doesn't control the schedule, so they would all need to stay there all the time to block anything. Usually, the majority party will bring things to the floor when they know there's not enough people in the minority around to block them.  In this case, Donald Norcross had been hospitalized with sepsis. He only returned home today (Thursday).  The other Democrats who didn't vote were Troy Carter, Gerald Connolly, Josh Gottheimer, Glenn Ivey, William Keating, Mikie Sherrill, and Lori Trahan.  Gerald Connolly was there as he [introduced a resolution](https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6418) today. But he hasn't voted on anything since April 10. He announced on April 28 that he's retiring due to his struggle with cancer, so that may be the reason why he hasn't been voting lately.  Lori Trahan, Troy Carter, Mikie Sherrill, William Keating, Glenn Ivey and Josh Gottheimer voted on things earlier this week. Perhaps they left a day or two early for a trip (today's the last day Congress will be in session before a short break).",joggle1,2025-05-08T19:26:43,6
