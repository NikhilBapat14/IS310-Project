"The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is a federal law that ensures educational rights and services for children and youth experiencing homelessness. It provides funding for programs that support these students' enrollment, attendance, and success in school. The Act defines homelessness and outlines the responsibilities of local education agencies (LEAs) in identifying and serving homeless students.  https://www.google.com/search?q=McKinney-Vento%20Homeless%20Assistance%20Act&client=firefox-b-1-m",FervidBug42,2025-05-10T14:56:32,1

"Definition of homeless individual? Lemme guess, if you have a heartbeat then you're not homeless according to Republicans.",TheeHughMan,2025-05-10T15:01:43,1
My guess is they will try to cut off spending for homeless immigrants.  Because these people are full of evil hate.,laseralex,2025-05-10T15:48:22,1

Is this just to be able to criminalize homelessness at the federal level?,beadzy,2025-05-10T16:35:03,1
$50 says they want to change the definition of “homeless individual” to something with cisgendered language to exclude trans and nonbinary kids from the services.,codyashi_maru,2025-05-10T17:21:51,1
Probably some more DEI nonsense ,arilupe,2025-05-10T15:49:53,1
Can you find any info on what's being amended? I tried to navigate the page and didn't see what this does.,Pad_TyTy,2025-05-10T15:02:16,1
"They can't quite go that far, primarily because they still need more groups to demonize once they're done with trans people, and also because they need some horrific statistic they can point to once they're out of office to say that the new guy is fucking everything up.  So they'll likely to change it in a way that can still let it be used as a weapon, while putting less money into it.",StevesRune,2025-05-10T16:13:22,1
