Lawn signs? Really? Former President President Trump always finding new ways to show how tacky and weird he is.,Blasphemous-Bill,2025-04-28T09:06:37,12
Arrested is not the same as tried and convicted.  So innocent until proven guilty is no longer a thing in this administration?  The crimes are horrendous but rule of law says you need a trial to find you guilty first.  Trump being judge jury and executioner here for real.,Cleanbriefs,2025-04-28T09:00:26,23
"One says ""Arrested: RAPE.""  Would be terrible if someone switched the photo on it.",subUrbanMire,2025-04-28T09:04:08,10

By the end of the week you'll be able to buy these signs at the official White House store for just 4 easy payment of $999.99.,ImWithTheBanned1,2025-04-28T09:15:32,4
"Gross. This is why Americans need to keep applying the pressure. Pack your town halls and your streets. Overwhelm your rep’s and senator’s offices. Be loud and relentless about your disapproval. The people in this admin are the most damaged, demented, and deranged characters we’ve ever witnessed. Truly sociopathic. Without pushback, one could easily imagine a day in the near future when those signs are replaced by the actual bodies or corpses of the countless minority groups they’ve hammered into their base as  “the enemies” of this country. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-28T09:19:28,4
Where is the picture of the infants they are deporting?  Or the mothers being torn from their families?  How about the people that are here legally but sent to prisons?  Anyone celebrating this (looking at the Fox Entertainment comments there are many) you are disgusting excused for human beings… and the God you pretend to follow… he is going to judge you harshly.,Brokkyn2024,2025-04-28T09:02:51,3
"Next can we get posters of major polluting CEOs who care more for profit than mercury damaging infants' brains,  those who kill by denying health care to millions,  those who cause death by profiting off anti vaxx and other conspiracy theories, those who cut off meals on wheels, cancer research in order to give tax breaks to billionaires,  those convicted of violence during J6....  We could go on...",SicilyMalta,2025-04-28T09:03:19,3
What about the convicted one now leaving skid marks in the Oval Office? He's okay because he's a citizen? Or cos he is a 'billionaire'?,AnAcctWithoutPurpose,2025-04-28T09:04:07,3
"And these crimes by immigrants are still a small percentage of overall crime. If they are criminals, sure arrest, try, convict and deport them. But they deserve a day in court. And of these yard sign people, are these allegations? Or convictions? This could be seen as defamation if they’re not convicted.",hifumiyo1,2025-04-28T09:10:24,3
How many *convicted* from Trump's first administration?  Because *that*  lawn display would make quite the counter-protest to the current lack of due process.,subUrbanMire,2025-04-28T09:18:13,3

"Weird, first one looks AI generated, most are not mug shots, and no names are given. * Picturing Bondi giving a media staff member instructions: I want a hundred posters made, images must depict non white men, lable them illegal immigrants and randomly lists crimes committed.",No_Technician497,2025-04-28T13:30:36,2

"When people keep saying the child with cancer who was an American citizen simply left with his mother, I'm appalled.   We give visas to parents who come to the US to get medical  treatment for their foreign children all the time - but we wouldn't do the same for one of our own citizens??  Disgusting.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-28T09:12:38,3
"I'm sick of people screaming about BLM whenever we mention J6. J6 criminals despite causing the death of people and severely beating police were all pardoned and freed.  There were  boasts that the first thing they did was buy a gun and many promised retribution. Dozens have past criminal convictions and have ended up incarcerated again. Why are we not hearing every day on Fox and OAN about this?   In the meantime ,  all BLM people who were convicted of violent behavior are still in prison.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-28T13:09:57,2
"You're confusing the government with public opinion. Just think of OJ for example.  Also you clearly just want to argue with that comment, just wanted to point out why it doesn't Make sense.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-28T09:14:40,12
Rittenhouse has been absolutely shown to be not the kind of person you want to vouch for. A lot of stuff has come out that if known at the time would have probably seen him convicted. His weird roleplay in uniforms with a vigilante desire to murder people....  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/kyle-rittenhouse-texts-disillusion-ex-spokesperson,SicilyMalta,2025-04-28T09:09:23,11
"“Mom! Drive me across state lines with a borrowed gun so I can defend businesses that I don’t have any stake in because I don’t like protestors! Oh, and I’ll act like I’m a medic, even though I have no training and chase down the protesters to provoke them!”",hifumiyo1,2025-04-28T09:13:28,7
"The facts of those cases weren't really in dispute. The only question was if their actions were justified, and you don't need a jury to decide for you if you personally feel their actions were justified. The court finding them guilty or not guilty is irrelevant.",DartTheDragoon,2025-04-28T09:35:30,0

Murder is OK if you are pleased that those who were killed disagreed with your opinion.   Got it.,Im_gumby_damnit,2025-04-28T10:26:36,2
It was a straw purchase. It's in the transcript where his buddy testified that that dipshit wasn't allowed to take it out of the safe without explicit permission from he or his stepfather. The friend testified that he and his father did not that day. Ironic that you bring up facts from the trial.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T15:01:06,1
