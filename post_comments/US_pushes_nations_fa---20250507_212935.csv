"Not just plain old corruption, but I wouldn't trust any infrastructure that's ultimately in Musk's hands. We've already seen him use it as leverage against Ukraine, after all.",Crommach,2025-05-07T22:13:50,8
"If democrats ever regains control all  contracts, grants to any of Elons businesses need to be terminated and investigated.",sedatedlife,2025-05-07T22:08:27,4
"Note that, even if they do *literally everything* being asked of them, they still pay a 10% tariff.  There is no fucking reason for any but the absolute poorest nations to give in.",absentmindedjwc,2025-05-07T23:26:02,5
No corruption here...,SGD316,2025-05-07T23:37:37,3
So most Americans and much of the world gets poorer a while Trump and Musk get richer.,econoquist,2025-05-08T00:22:23,3
What in the Skynet is going on here?,MariosBrother1,2025-05-07T21:51:23,2
How long before he demands every country allows musk to create doge branches to tear their governments apart too?,prodigalpariah,2025-05-07T22:06:50,2
Then Tesla must fold. There must be punishment. Oligarchs only know the value of money.,williamgman,2025-05-08T00:21:36,2
"I'm sure nothing will go wrong with massive corruption in this administration pushing a private citizen who \*\*\*can't even be trusted to not meet with our foreign adversaries secretly \*\*\* with the infrastructure to control satellites, internet, and surveillance. Nothing at all. Especially if and when it becomes even more clear how badly Musk sold out this country.",Purusha120,2025-05-08T01:14:13,2
"""That way we can rig your elections also!""",kevendo,2025-05-08T02:17:04,2
All of Musk's businesses would be bankrupt without gov handouts & corruption. Fuck that loser.,CosmicLars,2025-05-08T02:50:07,2
Madness to comply as Musk can and probably will just turn it on and off at whim.,krakeneverything,2025-05-08T03:34:57,2

"Wouldn’t it be wild if the US Military actually protected citizens from domestic terrorism, like all of the human rights violations, kidnapping & human trafficking, data theft, corruption, abuse, discrimination, racism, treason, constitutional violations, espionage, ignoring any security measures because they don’t care if anyone dies…",DrFarfetsch,2025-05-07T22:13:01,2

Definitely no to starlink or any Musk related products,Great_Revolution_276,2025-05-08T04:35:34,1
If EVER there was CLEAR evidence of corruption this is it. The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT is pushing for a PRIVATE COMPANY to receive contracts as part of national trade negotiations. Why not just skip the middleman and demand they show up to the negotiation table with a briefcase of money?,athornton79,2025-05-08T06:06:39,1
"Don’t worry must just be a coincidence since the corporate media and Xitter told me “he was stepping back” and not going to meddle anymore, and that couldn’t certainly just be PR bullsh*t.",PrismPhoneService,2025-05-08T02:21:30,1
"The blackmail is astounding too, if you ask me...we're at mafia levels here.",Stranger1982,2025-05-08T05:17:04,1
I’ll bet the contracts have some kind of “full payout upon early termination” clause. Because these AHs will try to play it that way,kokopelleee,2025-05-07T22:14:04,3
We need US vs All Elon's Money and US vs All Trump's Stuff.,account312,2025-05-08T01:32:28,2
It's insane how elon already controls the majority of \*\*\*all satellites.\*\*\* He's embedding himself into all the different parts of US government defense and R&D contracting and intends on making himself indispensable (more like building up a blackmail document),Purusha120,2025-05-08T01:15:42,1
Republicans have been successfully campaigning on making the rich richer and the middle class poorer. Reagan broke this country's brain ...,Purusha120,2025-05-08T01:17:31,2
He's already probably fed so much private data from our tax and health records into his little bot. Revolting.,Purusha120,2025-05-08T01:17:03,1
"It's only going to get less likely as Trump and his Gestapo purge the upper ranks as well as all positions they find filled with... ""undesirables"" and people who won't obey each and every command including deployment and harm against US civilians.",Purusha120,2025-05-08T01:16:40,2
