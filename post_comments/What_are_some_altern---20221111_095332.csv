"How much have you search already?  This topic has been covered on the internet many times in various sources, and i'ts unclear what you've already found from googling.  There are lots of ways to change the redistricting process to be fairer.  There's plenty of computer and other methods to divide districts; as well as metrics to measure how distorting a particular setup is. Note that most districts are equal population already, as that's fairly easy to enforce, and you can still have a lot of distortions even with equal population.  Generally, most fixes are about adjusting who decides the redistricting.  As there's lots of subtle ways to influence a result; so you want the deciding group to be one less interested in partisan concerns.   Though really, what's most effective would be to switch to a proportional system, or some other system that is inherently immune to gerrymandering.",zlefin_actual,2022-11-13T10:44:48,2
"The only way to really, truly, completely ""solve"" redistricting is to take away the problem entirely by either uncapping the House or by allowing for multiple member districts, or both. The problem with single member districts that are of a fixed number and must be periodically redrawn is that the various values that make for a good map are in tension with each other. Maximizing one value minimizes another, which means at a certain point judgements have to be made, which means even a mathematical/computer method will still have the same inherent flaws as the current structure. In fact, it's probably even correct to say that we currently DO use mathematical methods that are then tweaked and adjusted as needed by humans--but the ""as needed"" part is the thorn in the side that can't ever really go away.  For example, there are four main values a map maker wants to maximize: compactness (districts should be intuitive and place communities with similar issues together), demographic representativeness (all of the various groups within a district should have political sway that is commensurate to their population size), competitiveness (it's good when districts have actual political choices that can be selected between), and political representativeness (I'll call this ""safeness"" going forward, basically it's about making sure that a conservative area is a similarly conservative district, etc). The problem is that these four a best illustrated as two spectra, with the first two values being poles of one and the second two values being poles of the other.  Let's discuss the competitive vs. safeness one first. It is obviously good for districts to be competitive. Folks shouldn't have only one political option that always wins. Elections can't be meaningful if they are preordained, and there's no way to have effective political feedback without competitiveness. BUT it should be pretty obvious that Staten Island should have an easier time electing Republicans than the Upper East Side in Manhattan. This is also pretty obvious. What's the point of having districts at all if everything is essentially random? The point of a district is that it will be a form of local representation, and Staten Island is a pretty conservative place, so the representatives there that advocate for those values should have a pretty clear advantage.  It's similar with the other two issues. We could easily make simple blocks that group all the similar places together. It would be nice and compact and folks would very easily understand the logic behind a given district. But, doing that would limit the ability to accurately represent all the various people groups in the state. It would create a ton of districts where the minorities aren't big enough to wield any political power. This is made worse by the way human settle--contrary to all the pretty youtube videos explaining the one simple mathematical trick to solving gerrymandering, human beings settle in clumps. There isn't an equally dense distribution of people across the given area, which means just prioritizing neat, evenly sized spaces would create situations where there is a massively uneven spread between the amount of constituents represented in Congress, and it would hugely favor rural folks. That's not a good option either. To make it even more complicated, look up the story behind the ""earmuff district"" IL-04. In this case, the shape of the human settlement was weird enough that creating a district that literally looked like an earmuff was actually the *best* solution to ensure the state had the best mix of all of these values.  So the problem here is that no matter what, you've got some judgement calls to make. When should a given district be more competitive or less? When is a weird shape worth it, and when is it not? There aren't absolute truths to answer these questions. At a certain point, there are answers that *obviously* are insufficient. But in most cases, there's a range of answers that are all somewhat defensible, and that's why we still have this problem.",mormagils,2022-11-14T09:56:07,2
"I just posted this as a reply to the Politics sub, but I’ll copy it here to maybe get some discussion going…  What if you start by declaring a standard district size to be X sqr miles.  Then divide each state by horizontal/vertical lines (which would always result in an even number) to get districts as close to that standard X sqr mile size  Then give a weighted average vote to the rep of each district to compensate for discrepancies in the population to even them out?",LeftPhilly,2022-11-11T10:31:37,1
"To answer the last part, the times, places, and manners clause basically says that States have the default authority to decide election regulations, including district creation, but Congress may theoretically override it.  For example: drawing district lines to require the creation of majority-minority districts is federally required for all states.  So either states or federal government has the power to specify district drawing, and I think ultimately the answer boils down to which level's plan you like better.  But, if you want to argue that federal representatives should all be subject to the same rules, that's a perfectly fine argument.",digbyforever,2022-11-15T08:15:16,1
