"It's possible to imagine bringing new technology into the government in an intelligent, beneficial way. Too bad we've got an evil, incompetent team on the job.",30mil,2025-05-07T05:57:35,16
"*The goal — a centralized system with unprecedented access to data about Social Security, taxes, medical diagnoses and other private information — would create a multitude of vulnerabilities, experts say.*  — sub-headline",lotta_love,2025-05-07T05:52:16,7
There’s a reason this data is decentralized by law. Too bad this administration doesn’t care about law.,BigDaddyBain,2025-05-07T06:16:16,12
The conspiracy theorists got so close yet so far by voting for the deep state Republican Party.,menagerath,2025-05-07T07:18:18,4
Great idea! Now if Noem's purse gets stolen again all of our information gets stolen. ,arilupe,2025-05-07T07:58:51,3
Doge already took all the data. The data is not at risk it is gone.,mytthew1,2025-05-07T08:18:38,2

The real deep state... just like China. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-07T08:20:52,1
"After giving away all our private data to techbros (by not imposing serious Data Privacy laws), the icing on the cake will be turning Americans' PII into a loosey-goosey experiment for a bunch of pimple-face supremacist incels.  DOGE have to re-hire most of the people they've fired, and we have to pay for it.  How did THAT information help them?  The only information DOGE needs to pool:  CLEAR understanding of US LAW, and the US CONSTITUTION.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-07T06:04:04,9
"Not incompetent. They have competent guys who will competently do evil things with this data. It's only incompetent if you assume they are trying to improve the government, rather than break it and steal things.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-07T08:33:22,1
"""Hey, I'm trying to log in but all our passwords are now in Russian.""   Da, dis is da feature!",theaceoffire,2025-05-07T06:47:36,1
Remember when republicans decided to combine federal police and other agencies into DHS.  Its the same goals.,TintedApostle,2025-05-07T06:18:44,5
"If I were on the outside looking in, it would be funny af that the ""I need guns to defend myself from tyranny"" crowd voted for the people who actually want to turn the country into a police state.",Puma_Man_619,2025-05-07T08:10:45,3
It made their work of oppression easier. Now it looks like they’d be able to build a whole profile on you in one database. The bits of information they need would typically be harder to access.,BigDaddyBain,2025-05-07T06:28:42,4
"That passed 90-9 in the senate. The house was a bit more split, with almost every R in support and 40% of the Ds.  The 2000s were a weird time. A lot of bills got more bipartisan support than people expect.",SomeDEGuy,2025-05-07T08:03:04,3
"It was done under the guise of ""the terrorists are coming"" and that the reason 9/11 happened was because ""they were not sharing data"".  In reality it happened because Bush purposely dismissed Clinton's teams security warnings.",TintedApostle,2025-05-07T08:04:26,5
