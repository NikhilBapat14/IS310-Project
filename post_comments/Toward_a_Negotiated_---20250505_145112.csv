"Writing at *RealClearPolitics*, [Peter Berkowitz](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/peter-berkowitz) examines the Trump administration’s ongoing legal battle with Harvard University and proposes an alternative course: a negotiated settlement. Seeking to remedy the underlying causes of the current dispute, Berkowitz argues that “a reasonable settlement should reduce indoctrination at Harvard in favor of liberal education while obliging the government to honor the university’s academic freedom and institutional independence.” Berkowitz sees many salutary aspects of a settlement for Harvard, its students, and the Trump administration—as well as for American citizens, who “could draw inspiration from the White House’s and Harvard’s cooperating to achieve compromise and conciliation that advances the public interest.”",HooverInstitution,2025-05-05T14:51:28,-4

">I’m of the mindset that the federal government shouldn’t be giving any money to any colleges and universities.  Agree 💯 %, unless it's for genuine research (example an Apollo program) and not for NGO goverment money laundering schemes and the usual leftist (and rightist,) government corruption schemes.",GiediOne,2025-05-05T16:07:21,4
