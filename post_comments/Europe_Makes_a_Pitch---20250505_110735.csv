"In some twisted sense, Trump is a victory for leftists who hated the American empire. Brain drain was one of the main ways the US maintained its dominance.Â ",JesterOfEmptiness,2025-05-05T11:23:54,1

They are likely leaving because of the similarities of trumps USA to the Khmer Rouge.  Not saying they are going to purge the intellectuals but they seem to be starting the firing process and the campaign against intelligent people.,waitedfothedog,2025-05-05T11:37:04,5

"Many of the brightest minds of my generation are being used to figure out how to target advertising better. We do not pay or appreciate researchers or scientists in this country. There's very little material incentive for driven Type A people to use their ambition to help communities.   The people who are choosing those careers do so because they deeply care about the issues and science. They absolutely could be making much more money finding new shampoo blends, building a slightly better laptop that will delf destruct just ij time for the next generation release, or other commercial research than fighting diseases or whatever.",RainyRobin2,2025-05-05T12:03:15,2

"Iâ€™m not a scientist but an engineer and I make double to triple my european/oceanic counterparts. There is no way I would ever move unless they up their pay. I know this is true across many professions, so iâ€™m not sure where youâ€™re getting the idea the pay is equal.",[deleted],2025-05-05T20:01:44,1
now contrast the pay difference with the benefits you dont have to directly pay for like insurance etc.  Does that bring it any closer?,Skraelings,2025-05-06T08:41:52,1
"No, in good jobs the benefits are great. My health insurance is arguably better than any Europeans, I have $0 premium and a $750 deductible and can choose any hospital I want. I have 4 weeks PTO but am able to earn extra weeks throughout the course of the year. Bad american benefits are generally just attributed to lower skilled jobs.",[deleted],2025-05-06T12:24:01,1
