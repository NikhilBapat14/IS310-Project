"“Yes, actually, that perception came from some focus groups we did in Michigan with a bunch of people in February, just trying to understand what happened in 2024.”  For fuck’s sake, we just want you people to have a spine. The reason the Democratic party is in a crisis is because they’re so goddamn scared of doing anything that hasn’t been market-tested and focus grouped a million different times. Slotkin is the exact opposite of who we should be looking toward for leadership. How can we expect our representatives to hold people to account if they’re too scared of how it’ll be perceived?",coltvahn,2025-05-01T08:44:05,20

I don't like this lady and am really hoping she's not who the Democrats are trying to shove down our throats for 2028 or whatever - we need someone who is willing to say the truth and who has more charisma saying it.,OverallDisaster,2025-05-01T08:43:30,8
"We do not need any more alpha energy. Alpha energy is how we got to this exact place. We need collectivism, far-sighted policy initiatives, and a marginalization of corporate interests in politics. We need people who will fight for The People, not to sit around collecting ever-ballooning dividend checks until it’s time to start the campaign back up again. Where are all the litigators and policy nerds?",420andhikingboots,2025-05-01T10:39:41,6
"Slotkin just sounds clueless here.   Her solution to the Dem Party’s perception ills? The Dems need to provide a positive view of what they will do for people and focus on economic issues. How novel.   That’s what Kamala’s campaign did, that is the precise playbook they ran. So what is Slotkin even talking about?   Also, constantly handwringing about why Dems have low ratings is not particularly “alpha.”",Donkletown,2025-05-01T08:47:53,6

"It's not even about that now. Their message each and every day should be that America is becoming a fascist, militaristic  surveillance state and that Trump needs to be impeached.

"I mean, I hate the term ""alpha"" but she's right.  They need to step up like Jazmine Crockett.  She's not holding back, or sitting on steps asking for a conversation, or waving a cane.  She's actively calling them out on their bullshit at every turn.",2cigsaday,2025-05-01T17:04:41,1

"Yeah, but voters also need to stop falling for Republican agitprop which is a big ask. Ideally, it wouldn’t all be on Dems to try to find the exactly precise buzzwords to wake people up. It would be nice if Dems put the general point out there and voters were able to meet them there and able to see reality.",StormOk7544,2025-05-01T08:47:28,0
">PBS Dude:  >So, as part of this road map to, as you say, contain and defeat Donald Trump, you say the Democratic Party should shed its public perception as weak and woke. Why is that the right approach and how do you suggest Democrats get there?  >Sen. Elissa Slotkin:  >Yes, actually, that perception came from some focus groups we did in Michigan with a bunch of people in February, just trying to understand what happened in 2024, why we didn't win at the top of the ticket, because you can't figure out where you're going until you understand what's happened.  >And I think we — those are the two words that were used over and over again. And I think, for me, focusing on pocketbook issues, people's wallets, people's kids, and then, on the second side of it, just bringing a little alpha energy back into the party, right?  >And I'm from the Midwest and for us, leaders like our coaches are just — they have got some alpha energy to them. And I think we have lost some of that in the party and I want to see that come back.  A lot of us will trip up on the phrase Alpha Energy, and rightly so, but the specific of the question and full response make Slotkin sound less stupid than the headline. The phrase is shitty, the idea behind the phrase is erroneous,  but at least Slotkin wasn't fully channeling Andrew Tate",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-01T08:33:11,0

"I disagree he is just another rich person out for himself under the idea of a good billionaire. We should fight for people like Pete Buttigieg, someone who cares about the working class, and is willing to dive into right-wing podcasts and Fox News to actually put our points forward. He is a popular and well-spoken person with a strong political future and strong support across the democratic spectrum. Pritzker, on the other hand, is what the establishment democrats want you to believe is the way forward so they can push the same policy status quo that hurts us all.",Classicman269,2025-05-01T10:17:24,2

"Uh, not sure i agree. The added context actually makes it worse. She uses the phrase more than once.    Why do so many democrats insist on co-opting republican rhetoric and republican vocabulary?

"Watching them scramble so hard to find a narrative they can roll with in that ""how do you do fellow kids"" way while they actively capitulate every day is so embarrassing and all it reveals is that they don't actually mean anything they say, which is the real problem.
