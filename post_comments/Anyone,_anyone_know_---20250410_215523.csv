"Ironically, Ben Stein is an actual economist and genius who said Trump doesn't ""know a goddamn thing about economics."" Also called him ""dangerously misinformed."" And this  >He is not a great businessman. He inherited a great deal of money. He did some successful real estate deals. Hardly anyone could miss doing successful real estate deals in New York considering the incredible boom that has taken place and the very low base point when he started out. He is not a great businessman at all – in no way.   He was then asked  >*Imagine Trump is elected president and he starts enforcing some of the policies he has mentioned. Would the economy improve, stay the same or get worse?*  Answer:  >It would get much worse. In terms, it would be a disaster. Trade is very important. The US economy is roughly 15% trade dependent – very roughly 15%.  >The question of the day: would his gains in fossil fuel deregulation offset the losses in trade? I doubt it.  >It’s very, very important that he get educated about the benefits of free trade.  He is also famously against tariffs. Writes books, essays, and does videos about them.    Yet voted for Trump. Twice.   Also said it is ""crucial that Trump be elected to *literally* save America.""  So, yeah.",undercurrents,2025-04-10T22:41:24,61

It would be a disaster but the lady laughs too much so my vote is for the man who will most certainly wreak havoc on the world’s economy.,Electrical_Key2085,2025-04-11T13:01:57,6

"I've always wanted to see a parody sketch of this scene where Ben steins character talks about how if the kids in the classroom don't learn from this lecture, that will have to have to live through the great recession, trumps first term, covid and trumps second term and the kids still ignore him. Then it cuts to 40 years later where they resent not listening to him",Mission_Hat_3476,2025-04-11T13:11:27,3
The kids in this video clip or reminiscent of the current GOP that have a hard time understanding many things especially the last kid drooling on the desk.,Danube11424,2025-04-11T14:41:23,3

He cries when he talks about Nixon resigning. He’s a sycophant by nature.,SignificantBid2705,2025-04-11T04:44:33,15
It would be a disaster if allowed to go on.  Whether or not you like Ben Stein he is completely correct.,ridauthoritarianism,2025-04-12T14:24:20,0
