why is this woman at a congressional hearing? Republicans are so obsessed with this stuff on campus. While also pardoning the proud boys and doing Nazi salutes. As an American Jewish woman it totally creeps me out.,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-05-07T21:06:29,9
I understand the current meaning of antisemitism... But the same MAGA behind this is the same MAGA that support the tiki torch bearing white nationalists in Charlotte North Carolina. They were chanting something pretty loud and clear (something about not being replaced)... Has something changed?,williamgman,2025-05-07T21:32:39,5
"Meanwhile Israel just announced they're seizing all of Gaza for ""an unspecified period of time"" and bombed the refugee camps.",ScientificSkepticism,2025-05-07T21:06:21,3
The GOP needs to investigate antisemitism within it's own ranks.,CraftyAdvisor6307,2025-05-08T06:00:14,2
Can we ask them to define antisemitism? Without including the country of Israel. It goes far beyond the borders of one country,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T20:53:55,2
Why wouldn’t they look into all discrimination?,ponyflip,2025-05-07T21:46:20,-3
Far easier than coming up with actual policy.  With the added bonus of when they utterly fail to (assuming we have more elections) their intransigence gives them something to run on next time.  As they know their fanbase will never blame them as they should…,oliversurpless,2025-05-07T21:15:41,5
"They weaponized islamophobia.  Support for Gazans, or Palestinians in general, now automatically means supporting Hamas and being a terrorist sympathizer. They also tucked in criticism of Israel to mean antisemitism in general, because you can in no way criticize a government while supporting the existence of the country and people. It's deliberate conflation to muddy the waters and leverage emotional manipulation. It gives his base something to rage at and something he can attack to make the base happy.  Trump doesn't actually care about Israel, Israelis, or antisemitism clearly. He just cares about folding in another authoritarian strong man archetype into the fold. Bibi, Erdogan, Kim, Putin, etc. it's a means to an end. They're all types that have malignant narcissism traits that can be exploited by other malignant narcissists. Bibi wants something, Trump can leverage that to enrich himself. Same for all the others.",mattgen88,2025-05-07T22:59:03,4
