">It is not an overstatement to say that the Trump administration has launched the worst White House assault in history on the environment and public health. Day by day and hour by hour, the administration is destroying one of the signature achievements of our time.",nimicdoareu,2025-05-05T03:34:46,34
"Hey at least with the elimination of NIOSH, these miners don’t have to worry about pesky policies and protections getting in their way of doing their job. OSHA won’t be an issue much longer either thank god, or trump, either way same thing.",BBQFLYER,2025-05-05T03:49:22,10
"Earth will eventually sluff us off and start anew. Trump only thinks of money to be saved or made in the here and now, not about the future of the planet. What a despicable human being.",invalidpassword,2025-05-05T05:45:03,8
It’s not enough he is going to leave us all broke .. he has to scorch the earth as well.,jimmygee2,2025-05-05T04:03:41,7
"He is an active threat to life on Earth. His belligerent stupidity places everybody at risk, globally. He should be taken out of the White House and placed somewhere he cannot cause any more harm to the planet. It is in everybody’s interests that he ceases to have any power.",silverfish477,2025-05-05T08:35:32,6

"Got a friend from college, we both have Wildlife Resources degrees. He posts a lot on his story of petitions and such about stopping congress from selling federal public lands. Yes, he was one of those people that complained about the price of eggs. I even remember Vance saying that we have too much federal land and how we should build complexes on them to fix the housing crisis (This was on the JRE). Good riddance.",Nervous_Tax3843,2025-05-05T05:37:34,2
Making Nixon look good is quite an achievement.,BenevenstancianosHat,2025-05-05T04:13:27,14
“Complexes” likely means building luxury vacation homes. Developers with a history of donating to Trump’s campaigns will win the bids.,MultiGeometry,2025-05-05T10:14:24,4
"I mean Nixon was the one who initially created the epa, he was a terrible president for a variety of reasons but the environment was not one of them.",jonermon,2025-05-05T05:45:34,9
"He was probably still smart enough to understand that the environment should transcend politics, if it goes down so does everyone and everything on this planet",HeadfulOfSugar,2025-05-05T07:41:16,3
