Have you even seen the numbers of deportations under prior admins?  Did you know a criminal conviction has been the fastest way to lose legal immigration status for decades? Did you know a crime that is merely committed (in other words the conviction need not predate the date of naturalization) is a common way for naturalized citizens to even have their citizenship stripped post-conviction?

"The downvotes don‚Äôt matter. I may be missing the posts where people wanna keep convicts here, but I don‚Äôt recall seeing any. As of about 20 years ago it‚Äôs been well known that a conviction of any crime carrying a max sentence of two years would be treated by the Feds as a felony and out they go. About that same criminal defense attorneys with immigrant clients of any type started providing very small-c conservative advice and telling their clients practically any conviction was problematic. Not all lawyers are that risk averse or care, though, and a lot of people have been railed thanks to bad advice.  TL;DR - about the only convictions I see people tolerating are the lowest of misdemeanors. Maybe it‚Äôs just my bias, but I don‚Äôt see people willing to die on the hill arguing that convictions should not result in deportation. As I said it‚Äôs been the priority to boot those for decades.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T18:13:44,6

You‚Äôre still not acknowledging the fact that you said democrats and the left want zero deportation when the facts show that during the last administration they were deporting people at a similar pace but with due process in tact.

Now it‚Äôs either you‚Äôre on ‚Äúteam deport‚Äù or ‚Äúteam keep‚Äù if you get what I‚Äôm saying.   I did a bit of research and found what you‚Äôre saying, Biden did deport a lot of illegal immigrants. It‚Äôs just taken a shift now that we have Trump",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T15:31:36,-1
"Personal experience - I‚Äôve said time and time again that I support deporting criminal aliens, not all illegal immigrants. That take gets me downvoted so often, when I do feel that‚Äôs a moderate stance to have.   Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? The other options are deport everyone, or don‚Äôt deport anyone.

"A few things -   I believe in empathy. There is a reason why we have immigrants coming to the US. Many of those reasons are due to US policy creating situations where people cannot survive where they live and must find better work. I believe we approach everyone with the understanding that they are victims of this mess of a system.   Part of it is because US propaganda keeps selling a grift that the US is opportunity incarnate, and people bought it, including ourselves. We sell false dreams and then trap people in poverty traps until they *do* commit crime.   *It feels like Le Mis, eh?*  It‚Äôs also because industry does not care about laws because they know that illegal immigrant (that they bring in) are the ones punished if caught, not the companies themselves.   I believe that criminals - no matter their status - should be held to account for their actions. Immigrants and companies - That means that they do their time and sometimes that means being deported. Cool. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are in the US without a visa or if your the President (pregnant pause).  It doesn‚Äôt mean they get shipped to terrorist prisons in foreign countries without due process, or dumped on another nation to be exploited or persecuted.  All of these are progressive values. They are not radical. I put empathy first, always. Empathy is not leftist, it should be standard for everyone. Having empathy doesn‚Äôt make you a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù  You are (effectively) saying the same thing. That‚Äôs not centrism. That‚Äôs progressive.   And finally - the average age of a redditor is 23, with only around 13% over the age of 30. Reddit is *not* real life. The demographic of Reddit has more black/white thinking because most folks are still at that stage of brain development. Further, only about 2% of the IS population visit Reddit and leas than 1% comments. Reddit is not a representative sample. (In multiple ways)  I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and I feel there isn‚Äôt any centrism in the US. What you said is progressive, full stop. And a few snot nosed kids who think they have the world figured out can‚Äôt change that or gaslight you into something different.",wanderlustcub,2025-04-22T16:21:18,1
"I try not to be that way but I‚Äôm as flawed as anyone who isn‚Äôt a politician.   Immigration is a complicated mess and the GOP has been more dishonest about it over the last decade than dems. It‚Äôs super frustrating because one non partisan way to stem undocumented migration is by holding the people who employ them to account. We both know why that doesn‚Äôt happen: because the people taking advantage of them are rich and pump money into politics.  I would love to return to a time when there was policy debate, but that‚Äôs like wishing for tv to return to its pre-reality tv days.  Maybe I‚Äôll be wrong but we are careening towards several national calamities and this regime isn‚Äôt up to dealing with any of them. Best advice I can give you: learn gardening and canning.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T18:06:04,2
"Yeah having empathy is important. You could argue the most progressive strategy is to deport very few and instead crack down on companies hiring illegal immigrants who are desperate for any work. I agree that due process should always be given. This is why mass deportations are probably not feasible, given how much time and effort you need to provide to make sure everyone is fairly deported.   I do probably hold some progressive ideas, but I hold ones that are downright conservative too. I support Israel and their fight against Hamas for example. That‚Äôs super unpopular here, because most people believe Israel instigated Oct 7, while I believe the conflict has more to do with extreme religion than anything else.   I feel like this sub has got to be older than all of reddit. People talk about Al Gore too much, lol   I‚Äôm hoping Steven A. Smith makes it far in primaries leading up to the next presidential election, he would be my guy.",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T17:14:31,1
"Eh I‚Äôm sure once the Donald is out in ‚Äò28 that we‚Äôll have some sense of normalcy again. He will simply be too old even if he wants to rule forever. The only thing is, how much will his opinion influence politics after he leaves.   On immigration, I feel like most illegals already in the country are hard working and don‚Äôt want to cause trouble and put themselves as it is. If you come here and commit crimes, then it shouldn‚Äôt be a left or right issue, you‚Äôve gotta go.   Idk if I‚Äôm going to build a bunker and prepare for the worst, I feel like cooler heads will prevail when it comes to conflicts with Russia or China.",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T18:58:18,1
