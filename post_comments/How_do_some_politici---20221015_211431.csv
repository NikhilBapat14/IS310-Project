Democracy is hard. You have to educate yourself on the issues and the candidates for so many different offices. These guys make democracy … “Trust me and I’ll make all the other decisions! No need for you to use that big ol’ brain God gave you because he told me all the right things to do!”,HeartwarminSalt,2022-10-16T16:19:14,9
"It's a case of picking a few culture wars and creating a narrative that binds them together. Eg immigrants are coming into the country, voting Democrat which will allow the democrats to force abortions on you all and they'll take away your guns so you can't resist.  If you hate immigrants, abortion or want easy access to guns you now have a reason to care about the other issues too. And there's only one guy selling what you want to buy.",[deleted],2022-10-16T09:32:19,9
"You can simplistically divide politicians into populists and machine politicians. The latter spend their time appealing to their peers within the party to get enough support to take 'their turn'. Of post-war American Presidents, you'd probably classify Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Bush I/II, Clinton and Biden this way. While they obviously have to be popular enough with the voters to get elected, their policies and rhetoric are aimed at a narrow class of elites who occupy positions of power in the party.  In contrast, populists attempt to circumvent the party hierarchy by appealing directly to the public. Eisenhower, JFK, Carter, Obama and Trump would all likely fall into this category. Because they're focused on the rank-and-file voter, they tend to generate a lot more enthusiasm from those voters. However, they tend to have difficulty building a durable legacy because they don't have the party hierarchy behind them.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-17T05:29:54,3
"This is literally what charisma is.  Some people have it and some people don't.  Your question is like asking why some comedians make people laugh more than others - much like having an innate predisposition to being able to make people laugh, charisma is impossible quantify or explain objectively.  It just is.  **[Edit]**  I have no idea why this would be downvoted, and I can't believe that I'm having to cite dictionary definitions, but:  > [charisma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charisma)  > 1: **a personal magic of leadership arousing special popular loyalty or enthusiasm for a public figure (such as a political leader)**  > 2: a special magnetic charm or appeal  My original comment was extremely literal.  What the OP is describing is *literally, in accordance with the dictionary definition*, charisma.",regissss,2022-10-16T18:44:24,3
Trump also came 2nd in votes in 2016.,redrumWinsNational,2022-10-16T20:20:59,4
Literally all the the people you class as “machine politicians” won the popular vote and yet one of your “populist” politicians never won the popular vote. Furthermore the idea none of the former “appealed to the public” is completely unqualified - no modern historian would describe Clinton or Bush I/II in this manner.  I think we can come up with a better explanation than something this shallow. Most of its logic falls apart on just a little examination.,dunpyklungo,2022-10-17T06:35:51,3
"Being a ""populist"" isn't about being *popular* but about appealing to the popular sentiment rather than the sentiments of the party elites.  Moreover, you're mistaking the distinction I'm drawing. The ""machine politicians"" needed to work their way through the party hierarchy first while the ""populists"" didn't.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-17T06:59:51,2
"There is nothing you are saying that's right though. All those people except Trump literally were establishment politicians. Either Governors or Senators, or in Eisenhower's case supreme general of the allied army. If you get there,  you are a part of the party hierarchy. I mean Obama was the keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention for christ sakes.",Ziggythesquid,2022-10-17T07:29:33,2
"What? How exactly did one appeal to 'popular sentiment' if they only won the Presidency through the backing of a minoritarian movement? The person who had more people vote for them would logically have appealed to the public more; the reverse side implies people like Trump (and Bush II, forgot him) actually won through appealing to a small slice of elites that would get them elected absent a popular mandate.   >The ""machine politicians"" needed to work their way through the party hierarchy first while the ""populists"" didn't.  They just had to win the presidential primary. Trump won the nomination the same way George Bush II did: he won the primary.   This is far too simplistic a definition. Furthermore, none of it explains why Trump has such a cultish following whereas other populist politicians (under your own definition) like Clinton and Obama do not. There clearly is a deeper explanation.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-17T22:34:47,2
> All those people except Trump literally were establishment politicians.   So was Bolsanaro. Is no one a populist in your mind then?,ViskerRatio,2022-10-17T09:35:22,2
"> How exactly did one appeal to 'popular sentiment' if they only won the Presidency through the backing of a minoritarian movement?  Because your criteria has absolutely nothing to do with the definition of 'populism'.  > Furthermore, none of it explains why Trump has such a cultish following whereas other populist politicians (under your own definition) like Clinton and Obama do not.  Obama definitely formed a cultish following - just look at his activities post-Presidency where both he and his wife are viewed as celebrities in a way other past Presidents are not. Clinton does not because he was what I referred to as a machine politician.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-18T01:13:42,2
"Not the examples you're providing. Bolsanaro and Trump both styled themselves as populists but the bulk of their support came from wealthy, conservative families in Brazil and the USA, respectively. Not entirely sure what's populist about that. Someone like Viktor Orban is more clearly a populist, or perhaps demagogue is a better way to put it. Perhaps Jokowi, the current President of Indonesia, as well.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-17T22:36:30,2
">Because your criteria has absolutely nothing to do with the definition of 'populism'.  No, you appear to be confused. By all metrics Trump’s political opponents were more popular than him. You cannot win on a minoritarian movement without popular support and call it ‘populism.’ The word you mean is probably ‘ochlocracy’ or demagoguery.  >Obama definitely formed a cultish following - just look at his activities post-Presidency where both he and his wife are viewed as celebrities in a way other past Presidents are not.   Do you think ‘being liked’ is the same as a cultish following? I see virtually no difference to how other Presidents with Obama’s approval rating were treated. By what metric do you even quantify something like your statement? It’s easy to see Trump has a cultish following because supporters were willing to attack Congress out of their adoration for him. I don’t see anything near comparable elsewhere.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-20T18:43:31,2
> By all metrics Trump’s political opponents were more popular than him.  *Popularity* has nothing to do with *populism*. Go re-read my original post - I explain what populism actually is.,ViskerRatio,2022-10-20T18:49:04,1
It is nigh impossible to state one appeals to popular sentiment outside elites if a minority of elites puts them in power. The bigger appeal to popular sentiment would sit with the more popular politician.   I constantly see the phrase ‘populism’ thrown about w Trump but with very little to actually substantiate it. That’s all. Furthermore you haven’t addressed any of the other problems with your take I pointed out.,dunpyklungo,2022-10-20T19:59:29,1
