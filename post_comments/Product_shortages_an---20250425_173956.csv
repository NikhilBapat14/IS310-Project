People who voted for trump are just horrible. This sucks,henningknows,2025-04-25T17:48:24,38
It's going to be a grim holiday season....  What toys and electronics that make it to shelves will be expensive.  Thanks Donald The Grinch!,SadLeek9950,2025-04-25T17:52:20,20

"Snippet:  >Retailers are warning that U.S. consumers could once again be faced with empty store shelves and the kind of supply chain snarls that marked the Covid era if President Donald Trump's tariffs on China remain at their current levels.  >Companies have been canceling their shipments of goods from China and halting new orders after Trump put a 145% tariff on nearly all Chinese imports this month. As a result, the number of freight vessels scheduled to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles is on track to be down 33% year-over-year for the week ending May 10,Â [according to ship tracking data](https://volumes.portoptimizer.com/)Â from Port Optimizer.  >Typically, U.S. retailers would be ramping up their orders for two critical periods later this year: the fall back-to-school shopping season and the winter holidays. And the pullback is creating uncertainty about whether U.S. shoppers will have the selection of goods they've grown accustomed to in the coming months.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-25T17:40:33,13
"One of the biggest retailers in the world cancelled $10M of products that I sell that are built and ready to go to the port in China. Now there will be no product on shelves. Now there is a fight between the retailers and vendors/brands on who owns and is responsible for what, and the Chinese supplier is unlikely to get paid. Itâ€™s CHAOS.",Darth-Bag-Holder,2025-04-25T20:01:23,12
"Isn't empty shelves what we use to make fun of the USSR for? That Soviet system was inferior to the American system, because our shops were full of product, while Soviet shops had lots of empty shelves?   It is going to make America look bad, if we ended up with empty shelves, while China is the one with shops full of products.",xibeno9261,2025-04-25T20:59:12,8

"I am tired of the entire Republican party actually. The Republicans in the Senate could stand up to Trump and impeach him. But they have no spine.   They could vote to revoke Trumps ability to set Tariffs, but they have no spine.   The Senate could start doing their jobs, but they are so busy profiting from insider trading off these bullshit trade deals that they just can't be bothered.",FreshRest4945,2025-04-25T18:41:21,29

"I used to think it was a spine issue with them. But really it's them be traitors to our Democracy. They are all in. No apologies accepted now. None. They will leave this planet the same way the ""ex"" Nazis did after WWII. Angry and bitter at their own choices they can't admit to.",williamgman,2025-04-25T19:37:11,13
