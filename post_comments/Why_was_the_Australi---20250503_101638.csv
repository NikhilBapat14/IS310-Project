"I think it was largely Trump tariffs tbh and the other chaotic mayhem of the first 100 days. Dutton explicitly tried to jump on the Trump bandwagon, only this time it wasn't America and there was tangible evidence of the results.  Hats off to Albanese but like Carney he was helped a lot by the incompetence of Trump.",CasedUfa,2025-05-03T19:47:45,22
"Australian politics is not a two-party model. You’re looking at the 2PP simplification.  In reality there are a whole suite of smaller “minor parties” (like the Greens and the Fusion movement) positioned further left than the ALP or further right than the Coalition. There are also a lot of “independent” candidates, loosely grouped as the “teals”, who are not affiliated with any party - my parents live in a seat held by one of them.  The assumption was that the smaller parties like the Greens would take a larger vote share than they have done, and the ALP would be relying on support FROM the Greens, independents and so on to function as a government.  When this happens, it’s called a minority government. You don’t have quite enough to form a government and pass legislation in your own right, so you negotiate with amenable colleagues from other parties or with independents to make it work.  Instead of that, though, Labor ran a really coherent campaign and won back a chunk of support from the small parties, while independents won voters away from the conservative Coalition.",AlamutJones,2025-05-03T19:11:00,29
"A few months ago, the Aussie and Canadian elections were focused on domestic issues.  Given that both Canada and Australia operate effectively as two-party systems for the purposes of choosing the PM, throw-out-the-bums sentiment most favored the major opposition party.    Trump changed the focus of those elections to foreign policy and anti-US nationalist sentiment.  In both cases, local populist right-wing mini-Trump candidates who had been leading were destined to lose support when the American who inspired them became seen as a local problem.  The previous polls were not wrong.  The sentiment changed.  It should be noted that in Canada that the Conservatives actually won more votes, a higher percentage of the vote and more seats in 2025 than they had in 2021.  But the Liberals also surged and won both the plurality of seats and the popular vote, unlike 2019 and 2021 when the Conservatives won a plurality of the popular vote while the Liberals won a plurality of the seats.  The 2025 Liberal win came in large part at the expense of the NDP.  The 2020 US election does not match either of these.  The Democrats won the presidency due to fears of COVID and Biden's promise of stability, while Republican turnout overall surged to such a degree that it reduced the number of Democratic seats in the House of Representatives instead of producing the sweeping ""blue tsunami"" gains that the Dems had anticipated.    Dems don't want to believe it, but it was the first Trump impeachment that drove much of that circle-the-wagons turnout and set the stage for both losing the House in 2022 and losing the White House in 2024.  Democrats can't win when their own side lacks motivation while the other side is highly motivated.",I405CA,2025-05-03T20:27:16,7
"I don't think there is a consistent global pattern of right wing parties doing much better than the polls suggest, that seems to be the case with Trump for whatever reason but that's not a global phenomenon.",Daztur,2025-05-03T20:53:55,5
"Just to point out two things in Australia that are quite different. Firstly, compulsory preferential voting, which means neither major party can win on a turn out your base campaign. Secondly, Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world. The only state with a large ""rural"" population (Queensland) is consistently more conservative than the rest of the country. Outside of that, though, the LNP (centre right party) now hold no seats in most of the capital cities in the country, with the exception of Sydney, where they have been reduced to fragments.",jebusm,2025-05-03T20:44:48,9
"Pretty much everyone here isn't answering the actual question: ""Why were the polls wrong?"" rather than ""Why did Labor win?""  So, why were the polls wrong? I have a couple of ideas:  * Pollsters may have been aware of that ""centre-left parties tend to be over-estimated"" trend (which bit them in the 2019 federal election, by the way) and over-corrected. * The sample of people who will actually respond to a phone poll is not representative of the general population, skewing older.",Cole-Spudmoney,2025-05-04T04:58:40,2
"The current LNP (Liberal Party) in Australia is dominated by the Hard Right faction (the most right wing of the 4 LNP factions which also include the Moderates, Centrists and the Centre Right) so it wasn't the centre-right LNP running against the centre-left Labor party in this 2025 election but the more extreme right wing LNP.  The LNP leader Peter Dutton's long term personal dislikability with voters plus the lack of consistent or positive LNP ""policies"", constant backtracking of ""policies"" and own goal moments seemed designed to get large sections of the voting public offside - including more moderate conservative voters - rather than to win over any undecided swing voters.  The polls were very much in the LNP's favour earlier this year but that turned significantly during the election campaign as the LNP's very poor campaign performance snowballed (plus Trump's bizarre and erratic behaviour escalated) and Anthony Albanese and his Labor party ran a positive campaign.  Also, after four decades of voting, I have yet to be approached to take part in any official election polling so I'm still not sure how accurately or broadly these polls represent us as voters 🤔",wataweirdworld,2025-05-04T11:35:59,2
"I know that a lot of polling companies had been re-adjusting their preference flows from One Nation to have a higher split towards the Coalition.

"Take note trump, the Australian Election 2025 result is what a landslide looks like. It is hard for me to compare as I  have a limited understanding of the the workings of the US system. The Australian result gives the ALP a 85-37 seat majority in the House of Representatives, 76 seats are require to win (78.2% of votes counted). Earlier this year there was a similar result in the Western Australian State election. Labor won 2pp 57.2%-42.8%, 41.4%-28.0% of the vote. This result was achieved with the ALP loosing 18.5% of its vote in the 2021 State Election, obviously that was more a tsunami than a landslide. Peter Dutton and his party ran a poor campaign. They provide little policy and detail about what they stood for and what they would do. The nuclear power proposal which could not be mentioned and the entitled bad behaviour in some former Liberal electorates in Victoria did not help the LNP.",LongjumpingTurn8141,2025-05-03T23:09:59,1
"In Canada 2025 the right wasn't ""underestimated."" Final polling showed them about 3-4% behind and they ended up about 2.5% behind which is well within the margin of error.  I've been noticing a trend where people seem to think polling is supposed to be way, way more accurate than it really is.  They are based on models which can become more inaccurate as underlying factors change (and they are always changing.)",ptwonline,2025-05-04T10:52:44,1
"There were many issues that punished the Dud Dutton's aspirations like Nuclear Power, Racism, Medicare, Pharmaceuticals, Preferences to Pauline & Palmer, Education etc etc etc and above all his matching everything that Labor announced as sweeteners WTF.

"australian here.   i don’t think it was underestimated by polling. the polls showed the ALP was in front, and gaining, by election date. the last polls had them around s 53%, they will end up 55-56%. so it wasn’t a huge miss.  Barrie Cassidy, veteran political operative and commentator made an interesting statement on this result: you could see it from space. nobody in the media wanted to believe it, and polling up until january showed a close race  why polling is more accurate here? that’s a tough one. but it’s fair to say that australia probably has fewer people who are suspicious bordering on hostile to media and politics in general. i think that’s what makes the polls challenging when trump runs.  one technical things:  - our preferential system: left wing protest votes tend to reliably return to labor, where needed. that is, greens and further left voters show a degree of political consistency. as antony green  noted, right wing protest votes tend to be a vote “against politics” and their preference spray around. in fact, the explicitly trumpy party did not preference the conservative majority party - they directed preferences away from the sitting member. this impact is i think underestimated, and there’s a few key things to take away; for republicans:  i would not count on trump voters supporting ANYONE other than trump",drowner1979,2025-05-06T07:08:52,1
"Trump.  I think a damn lot of people are interested and intelligent but lack critical thinking skills (minimally taught at public schools for a long time now).  Trump has been a salutary lesson in why ""common sense"" and cruelty leads to bad outcomes and obvious morons in power.   So there wasn't that hoard of quietly right wing people deceiving pollsters.",llordlloyd,2025-05-03T22:39:11,1
"I'm a Republican myself, I could have told you this back in November. If Trump gets elected, expect the majority of the world not to go completely left, but they're not going to go super right. In the Canadian case, I think Pierre is a very good leader, and I'm very happy he is staying on because I think he will lead the party to Victory. They lost by such a small margin. It was the best performance since the 1980s, but the Liberals were able to hold on because they had a further left-wing party, and their voters went and voted for the Liberals.   In the Australian case, they used preferential voting the main conservative base held, but the governing party picked up partially because of the tariffs and the liberal leader running a very Trump-like campaign which people tend to like when Trump isn't in the picture. So labor picked up from the Green Party and other small left-wing and some other parties like the Teals the teals are like a mix of the Liberals and the labor Pro big business but they had the social policy of Labor well the independent vote that had previously been split with the Liberals and labor went for the small independent parties. Ultimately, both of these recent elections are not really liberal or labor results but more anti-trump results. Australia's next election is in 2028, and Canada's is not supposed to be till 2029, but small minority governments like this usually don't last there for more than two years,s, if that. In Australia, too, they have a very long history of oh crap, our poll numbers are down. We're going to the election. We've been in power for a while turn on the leader.",Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-05-03T21:51:05,-3
"Trump's approach the politics only works because he is a political unicorn who has survived multiple scandals and still is not harmed by pretty much any of it. Excuse me, sir, you slept with a pornstar. No, I didn't, so you've called women. You don't like terrible names, only Rosie O'Donnell. The guy was indicted and one in a modern-day landslide.

"Also, in Canada's case, it was a combination of Trudeau stepping down and Carney axing the carbon tax which were the two main things CPC were running on. Once those were gone, they ha nothing left.",Kevin-W,2025-05-05T15:45:27,1
"Trump really didn't have too much impact on this election. The main reason was just how bad the Coalition's campaign was. 0 popular policies, incredibly disorganised, constant backflipping, daily scandals because of terrible candidate selection, a lack of any actual message and platform and the leader being massively unpopular. Comparatively, Labor had a focused and well thought out campaign with strong messaging, some strong policies and good candidates. The trump tariffs was a factor, but it was a small one since the tariffs that hit us were way less significant than Canada's. If there is a Trump effect in the Australian election, it would be in regard to the Coalition's mindset and planning (or lack thereof) heading into the election. It seems that Dutton assumed he'd win because Trump did, as well as all the other right-wing populist victories against incumbent governments throughout recent years. Because of this, they opted for a small target campaign designed not to make waves for an election they considered already won, which obviously proved not enough to win as the polls started turning, and they spent the rest of the campaign scrambling to latch onto something popular (they best they had was cutting fuel taxes for 12 months).",LeChacaI,2025-05-05T19:50:00,1
I'd say also that the LNP (what OP is calling COA) lost many voters with Dutton and the party's push to identity politics and Trumplite-ism. The Greens lost some for their own identity politics I think and the polls underestimated that impact on Australians.,violetx,2025-05-03T19:54:37,13
"It felt to me that the coalition lost the election, rather than Labor winning it. And the actions of the American right helped our left no end. Why on earth would anyone willingly vote for the right if that's what you end up with.",foul_ol_ron,2025-05-03T23:08:09,4
">Labor ran a really coherent campaign and won back a chunk of support from the small parties  It's a similar story in Canada, where the Liberals really benefitted from the collapse of the NDP, a smaller party to their left. By being able to consolidate the vote on the lefty half of the political spectrum, they were able to counter the significant surge in vote share which the Tories got.   Additionally, they got quite lucky with the efficiency in Quebec, where a smallish decline of the Bloc Quebecois allowed them to pick up a disproportionate number of marginal seats.",Black_XistenZ,2025-05-05T01:18:14,1
Just a correction but not all Independents are Teals. Teals tend to be conservative independents who run against unpopular Liberal candidates in conservative seats to offer an alternative to the unpopular Liberal candidate. The name comes from it being a colour similar but different to the Liberal blue colour.  A perfect example would be Tony Abbott's loss to a teal Independent in his seat in Warringah.,Appycake,2025-05-10T11:45:51,1
There is definitely a global trend of right wing parties outperforming polls and the OP listed several examples.,Knight_Machiavelli,2025-05-03T22:20:09,3
"To be fair, the Coalition usually outperforms polls in Australia. The big example is 2019, where they pulled off a shock victory after polls had been very consistently predicting a Labor majority, but it also applied to 2022, where although Labor won, Labor's tpp was a couple points lower than expected.",LeChacaI,2025-05-05T19:55:54,1
"There's also a question of ""were the polls wrong"".  If polling showed 53-47 and the final result was 54-46 as the post described, that's not a polling miss.  That's a pretty accurate poll.  Further, polling error is fairly random: it can go in any direction.  We've had some high profile misses towards the GOP in the US recently, but we've also had plenty of misses towards Democrats that didn't garner a bunch of attention (either because of fairly small misses or because the miss did not change the outcome of the race).",link3945,2025-05-04T17:13:22,2

"Not saying those aren't factors but does that explain him losing a seat he held basically forever. I think Trump is the big factor there, that sort of personal repudiation should have something driving it and cant just be his personal politics/brand else he wouldn't have even won before.",CasedUfa,2025-05-05T20:20:13,1
"I found it really interesting in the campaign how much the war in Gaza changed the Greens vote. Just anecdotally, I ran into a lot of traditional greens voters who switched away out of concerns for antisemitism, and traditional labour voters who switched to the Green due to islamophobia, leading to a more inefficient vote spread.",jebusm,2025-05-03T20:36:23,10
"From what I've seen of the count so far the Greens haven't actually gone back in their overall vote that much? Currently they're polling -0.2% compared to their 2022 vote. They've just lost their seats because last election, in Queensland, they were mostly in LNP v GRN 2CP preference splits whereas this time the LNP vote cratered in those seats towards Labor and shifted the 2CP splits to GRN v LAB making all the remaining preferences go to Lab while if Lab had come 3rd in those seats those preferences would've gone to the Greens? While for Adam Bandt (who is probably still going to keep his seat), Melbourne underwent a boundary change taking in a whole bunch of Labor votes south of the Yarra while cutting out a bunch of Greens voters north of the new boundaries. So like, they've basically stayed the same but the boundary shifts and LNP collapse massively helped Labor.",rigormorty,2025-05-03T22:21:00,3
"Identity politics don't work in Australia, and I'll make the argument they don't work anywhere. What wins you elections when you are a conservative party and the left is in power is a Culture War. But for this to work, you have to let the left one party, in this case, the labor party, bring it up, and then you pound on it.",Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-05-03T21:19:15,0
That's definitely a statistically significant sample size...   It was probably just coincidence that it happened a few times in a row,Joshau-k,2025-05-04T08:56:17,3
"The suburbs are a tough spot for the Liberals right now. They’ve got no seats in Adelaide, just a few in Perth, and only a handful in Sydney — all of which is a letdown compared to what they were hoping for. Plus, all the quick changes in leadership have left them without solid options moving forward. On the bright side, though, it's worth noting that only Bob Hawke has managed to win three elections in a row for Labor. Albanese is going to have a tough go of it.",Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-05-04T14:28:14,1
"Yes, it does. Before this election, he did not have a strong personal brand, even in Dickson. He was just known as the candidate, and later as a senior party member. He had strong name recognition in the electorate, which compounded with his longevity in the seat. Despite this Dickson has always been a marginal seat, it was always on the cards to be taken by Labor depending on the specific election, and it very nearly was won by Labor last time. Why he lost in Dickson specifically has a few extra factors on top of what I already mentioned.   Firstly, Ali France ran a brilliant campaign, and was able to build on her efforts from her previous two campaigns. She has personally put in a hell of a lot of effort into campaiging there. This was also aided by Albo recognising that Dickson was winnable and targeting the seat heavily. A lot of money was put into the electorate by Labor, and senior Labor politicians would frequently be in the electorate throughout the campaign.  Secondly, the independent candidate Ellie Smith took a chunk of Dutton's primary vote and her preferences largely flowed to Labor.   Thirdly, there were some Dickson specific issues that turned voters off Dutton. We recently had a cyclone hit Brisbane, and a major scandal for Dutton emerged out of that because he chose to go to a fund-raiser in Sydney rather than support his electorate during the cyclone. Additionally, Dutton had pledged to build a nuclear reactor in Dickson, which obviously wasn't popular.   There was also a strong campaign specifically against Dutton led by the unions. This was an extra level of scrutiny that he couldn't withstand.   I think fundamentally, the biggest issue was that he as a candidate came into the national spotlight, and along with that all his flaws came into focus where they otherwise had slipped under the radar. His record as health minister was very heavily targeted by Labor's campaign, and this led to Medicare being a key election issue, which is an area Labor has more support on. He was a weak candidate that withered under the national attention he recieved throughout the election campaign. Once people got to know him, they hated him, and this was most true in Dickson.  For reference, I volunteered for Ali France during this campaign, and I've spoken to Labor volunteers who have been campaigning in Dickson since Dutton came to power.",LeChacaI,2025-05-05T21:07:54,1
"It's not a huge slip, but Melbourne - for example, as that's my home seat - was always tighter than it looked. A slight dip in Greens primary vote in the seat would matter.",AlamutJones,2025-05-04T00:21:32,4
I'm a lefty so take this with whatever bias you think shades it but the swing towards the ALP is in real teams the largest Australia has had in decades. The ALP has a very very large number of seats in the lower house including ones they haven't held in literal decades. I think it will take more than one term to swing back to the LNP especially when currently the LNP is essentially direction and leaderless.,violetx,2025-05-04T18:54:08,2
"I'm a conservative American so. I don't disagree completely. The party needs to find direction. And immediately, however, like you said, labor is holding seats they haven't held in decades. Is that because they have disapproval for liberals, or is it because they really like Albanese? Call me a skeptic, but I think it was more of a rejection of Trumpism than it was a rejection of the Liberals. They were leading in the polls for months and depending on the poll years.",Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-05-04T19:08:53,1
