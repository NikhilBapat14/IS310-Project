"This is one of the best ideas ever!  Congratulations New Mexico you have a very winning Governor, this will come back 10X at least in returns for your state future.  Children are our future and any way we can enhance their formative years is a big win.  Big win for children, big win for parents.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-27T10:24:43,50

Absolutely incredible and how it should be nationwide at a minimum for those that make less than let's say under a $150k a year as a household (number can be debated or that there needs to be a number at all I'm just pulling one out as an example)  But my question is and this could be answered I guess if I did my own research but wondering if anyone in the area can provide a quick answer vs me doing that as admittedly I'm being lazy and don't live there    But my question is how are they doing this?  Are they just giving some sort of childcare credit to families?  Are they just having childcare places in a way bill the state?  Is it a tax credit type thing?  Is there state owned and operated childcare facilities or designated privately owned ones providing this?   Just curious how they plan on rolling it out.  As a parent of two that our household really can't afford full time childcare or atleast one of our incomes would basically just all go towards childcare costs so it's just doesn't make a whole lot of sense so instead one parent stays home and has a part time business we run out of the house as a solution but money is always tight to say the least so just curious how this will work as I didn't see any included articles or anything,kpofasho1987,2025-04-27T14:34:55,6
How to actually encourage people to have kids!,toes_hoe,2025-04-27T18:08:08,3
I saw an article the other day about the government wanting to do something to make people want to have more kids.  They were talking about giving families $5000 for having a kid.  Like that thatâ€™s gonna be a big help.     This is one thing that they can do to make people change their mind about having more kids.  Another one would be to do something about the high cost of healthcare and education costs.,bde959,2025-04-27T17:07:15,2
"A great step, but all the people who make just over the limit are going to be in a shitty spot where they canâ€™t afford childcare but also donâ€™t get subsidies. Income limits, especially ones with a hard cliff, are just bad policy. Make it free for everyone.",DissidentDan,2025-04-27T13:59:04,4

"I completely agree or at the very minimum make it so the cut off is something to where it would include pretty much everyone    A combined household of 120k with how the housing market and just how much everything costs is waaayyyyy too low of a cut-off for the free childcare help.  If there was a maximum household amount I feel like it's gotta be like at the very least $250k so like double the current amount.  I think if you're going to put a maximum to please all the powers that be then it should be at minimum the $250k but honestly completely agree just make it free for all.  Most likely those that are rich wouldn't use the free Healthcare system and do something privately anyways.  But this is atleast a really good start and one I wish we had nationwide but ain't no way in hell that will happen if Republicans hold a majority anywhere especially  presidential   But it's things like this that democrats need to campaign on along with tons of other things.  I'm all for equal rights and LGBTQ protecting their rights and all that but that can't be what you're campaigning as a main talking point.  Instead make it things like this, free lunches at school, infrastructure and school investments and blah blah blah the list goes on and on and with how absolutely terrible everything is right now and projecting to be the democrats need to get it together and win midterms",kpofasho1987,2025-04-27T14:44:47,7

"You know I go back and forth so much about stuff like this. There is something truly democratic about no means testing. We have no means testing for public school education. Childcare can be seen as an extension  of public school education. In a way. But so many things are very expensive. How do you pay for it? We are so far in debt as a country with so many non negotiable obligations already. the amount we are spending right now on debt service is totally unsustainable.  Yes we need to raise taxes on the wealthiest and corporations, and reduce military spending. but just to try to get Medicare, social security, Medicaid, the budget deficit, and the national debt on some kind of stabilization track seems overwhelming.",Cluefuljewel,2025-04-27T11:29:24,17

"Letâ€™s say you have two kids, and it costs $15k per kid. Thatâ€™s $30k out $90k after-tax income. Thatâ€™s pretty unaffordable.",DissidentDan,2025-04-27T21:55:26,1
Saying all that you must not realize how much raising taxes on the wealthy would truly make a huge impact. Those programs you listed are not all that expensive,Nodebunny,2025-04-27T20:23:54,12
"So I live in the twin cities metro and a few years ago Minnesota wanted to make childcare free for household incomes under $60k/year, which is great Iâ€™m all for free childcare but a combined household income of $60k/yr? That means both parents are making poverty wages under $15/hr. Childcare costs hurt *everyone* even upper middle class families. So essentially, the middle and upper middle class would be paying higher taxes.   You can fact check me on that, Iâ€™m not sure if those numbers are exact but itâ€™s pretty close.   Make childcare free for everyone regardless of income and for the love of God pay the childcare workers good livable wages. My wife has been in the field for almost 10 years and is a director of a childcare center. She has to fight tooth and nail for the amazing women that work there for raises.   These women have the responsibility of your newborn-5 year olds life. They deserve better. And I say Women because itâ€™s clearly a women dominated field",FrigginMasshole,2025-04-28T10:18:58,1
$60 an hour per child.  Never knew it was so much.  I never charged more than 15.,Used-Painter1982,2025-04-29T13:07:36,1
"Well I really hoped that democrats could push through universal pre-k along with the various COVID spending bills under Biden. It seemed so possible at that point in time. Yet could not get it across the finish line. Not the same as free child care, but would have been a colossal benefit  for society.  Also maybe there should be or is a website with calculators that let you tinker with crunch numbers like you can decide what percent you think should be allocated for each category of spending and tinker with tax rates, revenue, population growth.  Fun stuff like that!ðŸ¤ª",Cluefuljewel,2025-04-28T00:43:01,1
Iâ€™m not sure what the hourly rate is. I just looked up the ballpark for the annual cost. It would depend on how many hours per week you need.,DissidentDan,2025-04-29T17:06:15,1
