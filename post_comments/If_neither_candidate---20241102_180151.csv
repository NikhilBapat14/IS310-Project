"The answer to your question is...it depends. If we get into this situation, the House and Senate get to make their own rules about how the contingent election works. The last time it happened, if a state delegation tied, their ballot was submitted as ""divided"" and a candidate needed a majority of states to win.  >Does ""majority control of 26 state delegations"" simply mean a majority of a state's elected House members are Republican?  Yes. So Republicans controlled a majority of Representatives for 26 states.  >Does each state House member get one vote, and the majority of that vote gets to cast their preferred vote in the House?  Yes, that's historically how it was done. So if Nebraska has 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat, the Republicans can vote and cast Nebraska's one vote for Trump.  >What happens if a state delegation can't reach a majority opinion?   Historically, the state submitted a ballot named ""divided"". So it counts as a vote for majority calculations, but nobody gets the vote.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-04T10:10:01,3
"Itâ€™ll mean Trump wins. One thing to keep in mind however, is that the reps voting will be the ones elected in 2024.",[deleted],2024-11-04T20:38:23,2
