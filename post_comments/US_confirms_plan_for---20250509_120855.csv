">According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot.  >The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week.  >The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say.  This is chilling, so now aid will be privatised, and who will do the screening? Also, having the IDF waiting outside is not a red flag, and I am sure they will abuse their positions there and start arresting young men they will accuse of being part of HAMAS.",kuulmonk,2025-05-09T12:11:08,17
"there is a suppression of Israel and Gaza discussion on ""Democrat"" and ""liberal"" subreddits (643k members total). Screenshot evidence at below link.  As an experiment, I searched ""israel"" or ""gaza"" on r democrats and r Liberal for posts in the ""past month"". I got no results as the screenshots show.  I searched for ""israel"" or ""gaza"" comments, too, and sorted the results by ""New"". You can see that comments are being suppressed too, as of 3-4 months ago.

"Because liberals don’t care about Palestine. As the saying goes, liberals hate every war except the one that’s happening right now.   Just like how Biden didn’t do anything to reverse any of Trump’s pro-Trump moves regarding Israel during his first administration, like recognizing Israel’s sovereignty of the Golan Heights or moving the Embassy to Jerusalem.   They were more mad that people had the audacity to protest Biden/Harris on the issue than they actually were on the issue.",walkallover1991,2025-05-09T13:39:12,3
"The idea that liberals don’t care about Palestine ignores reality. The loudest calls for ceasefire, accountability, and ending unconditional military aid to Israel have come from progressive Democrats—Tlaib, Sanders, AOC, Bush, Omar—and from liberal activist groups. The people marching, organizing sit-ins, and getting arrested over Gaza aren’t MAGA Republicans. They're overwhelmingly left-leaning.  Yes, Biden didn’t reverse Trump’s embassy move or the Golan Heights recognition. That’s frustrating, but it doesn’t mean liberals support it. It means U.S. foreign policy—especially around Israel—is a geopolitical minefield. Israel is a strategic ally in a region that’s been teetering on the edge for decades. Pulling support too fast risks empowering bad-faith actors like Iran and destabilizing relationships with neighboring countries. It’s a diplomatic trolley problem: support Israel and catch fire from the left, abandon it and risk regional chaos.  That doesn’t justify everything Israel does, but it explains why presidents, even Democratic ones, are cautious. It's not apathy. It’s calculation—sometimes flawed, sometimes spineless, but rarely simple.  And finally, the outrage over people protesting Biden isn’t because they protested. It’s because some liberals get defensive when the spotlight turns inward. But again, it’s the *left* doing that protesting. So let’s not confuse Democratic establishment politics with liberal values as a whole.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-10T10:38:49,1
"I think you are equating liberals with leftists. In the current political environment, the politicians you all mentioned aren’t viewed as “liberal,” but rather leftist.   Leftists overwhelmingly care about Palestine - liberals in the U.S. political system - your Hakeem Jeffries type of politicians - overwhelmingly don’t care about Palestine. Jeffries didn’t mention Gaza or Palestine once during his landmark speech, but he did mention U.S. support for Israel.   As someone who actually works on Middle East policy, if you are looking from a pure intelligence and military perspective, Israel isn’t this strategic ally it’s made out to be. Jordan and Egypt (and to some degree Turkey, although relations with Ankara have slowly deteriorated under Erdogan, but is still a strong military and intel alliance) basically have proven themselves to be just as capable in the region.   But we would be deluding ourselves if we think that’s the support Israel provides. Israel in today’s society is a U.S. client state that works to support the current military industrial complex under the guise of corpro-imperialism. Destabilizing the region (and preventing any pan-Arab movements from arising) is a key tenant of that goal.   It’s in Israel’s (and Washington’s) best interest to keep Palestine poor and essentially colonized. It’s basic dependency theory. Could you imagine how much different the region would be if there was a developed, wealthy Palestine that had a flourished port (with access to oil) of the coast of Gaza that could rival Haifa? No way is Israel going to allow that. The weird settler stuff (like Israel must control all of Judea and Samaria) is just the icing on the cake.",walkallover1991,2025-05-10T10:53:30,1
"Hmm...you're drawing a pretty convenient line between “liberals” and “leftists” to make your point, but that division isn’t as cut and dry in practice. Yes, Hakeem Jeffries and the centrist Democratic leadership aren’t exactly torchbearers for Palestinian rights. But acting like they represent all liberal voters is as reductive as saying Republicans are all Christian nationalists. The truth is, a huge chunk of liberal-leaning voters, especially younger ones, support a ceasefire and want the U.S. to stop sending Israel a blank check. That pressure is coming from the left within liberalism—and it's already reshaping the conversation. The Overton window’s moved, whether Jeffries likes it or not.  As for Israel's strategic value? ok, sure, you work in Middle East policy, but dismissing Israel as just a “client state” ignores the practical intelligence-sharing, cyber defense, missile tech, and joint military ops that do happen. You’re not wrong about Egypt or Jordan being capable partners, but let’s not pretend those regimes are bastions of stability or democratic accountability either. They’re fragile, authoritarian, and constntly on the edge. Israel, for all its problems (and they are serious) has been a consistently functional and technologically advanced military partner. That does factor into U.S. calculations.  The military-industrial complex critique? Fair. It’s real. But if you think every U.S. foreign alliance isn’t shaped by corporate and defense interests, then you’re picking and choosing your outrage. Dependency theory, settler colonialism, all of it, yes, those critiques hold water. But it’s not some one-sided conspiracy where Israel acts and the U.S. blindly follws. It’s a two-way power dynamic, with Israel also pushing back hard when U.S. policy doesn't align.  You can call out U.S. complicity and still acknowledge the regional complexity. You can demand justice for Palestinians without pretending that abandoning Israel would magically lead to a stable, unified Arab front.   It’s all messy. It’s morally uncomfortable. That’s the truth of it.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-10T11:15:46,1
