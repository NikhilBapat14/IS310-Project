"Trump, [during an interview](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/04/trump-third-term-economy-tariffs-constitution/83443855007/) with NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that aired May 4, [dug in on a scenario he introduced days before](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/30/trump-china-tariffs-toys/83372961007/) ‒ that little girls in the United States might need to accept having fewer dolls.  ""I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs – that's 11 years old – needs to have 30 dolls,"" Trump told ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker. ""I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China.""  Then Trump suggested children are capable of cutting back on a basic school supply: pencils.  ""No, I'm not saying that,"" Trump when asked whether Americans can expect to see empty store shelves in the future. ""I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.""     Trump is incredibly mentally ill.",Smithy2232,2025-05-07T03:32:44,684

Thinking that an 11 year old is a baby ( although he may have just been trying some kind of weird term of endearment) but speaking as if it was normal for any kid to get ‘30 dolls’ and make do with ‘fewer pencils’ is definitely a ‘let them eat cake’ statement but his cultists will not care about that.,Box_of_rodents,2025-05-07T05:21:06,29

"All true except the last part. They simply don’t acknowledge that things aren’t improving. They oscillate between claiming some things are awful and it’s the democrats’ fault, and some things are amazing and it’s the republicans’ doing. And none of it is even remotely grounded in reality. When they acknowledge a thing is happening that we universally know is bad (like perpetually growing wealth disparity, deporting children with cancer, etc), they will argue that’s it’s actually a good thing, if it is being supported or created by their party. Literally all because they chose a side instead of deciding what actually matters to them and pursuing candidates and policies that support that. The party tells them what they believe, and it changes every day, always for the worse. And they don’t spend even a millisecond experiencing dissonance or questioning it.   “Being poor is good because something something China? Sounds good to me!” “Children with cancer are gang members who are causing all the problems in America? Absolutely, that’s completely true. Yes.

So in his deals, there's always a winner and a loser, someone who will profit and someone who pays. He doesn't understand that the economy *isn't* a zero sum game and that both parties can get something out of it.   We might be buying fifty billion dollars more goods from China than they do of us, but the goods we buy help our economy (and they wouldn't really benefit the Chinese economy) while the goods they buy help their economy (and wouldn't really help ours).  Like we sell them the raw goods and materials to *make* the things we buy from them, and we buy stuff to make the average citizen's life better/more comfortable. So if we shut down trade not only are we now not selling the things *we make* but we aren't buying the things we want to stock our shelves.  It's an obvious thing to most people, but Trump can't see or accept the mutual benefit, he only sees a trade imbalance and thinks all that money is ""lost"" or ""wasted.""
