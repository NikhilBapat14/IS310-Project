They are only building it because they are destroying the world and causing wars over their own greed.,crosstheroom,2025-05-08T07:44:21,45
"I still donâ€™t get the endgame with that. Like okay, the world is basically ruined and you have to live in a bunker to hide. You wonâ€™t outlive any ecological damage and you definitely canâ€™t get in a rocket and go to another planet after shit settles so why? So you can die in a tomb filled with your rich guy toys like some kind of obnoxious Egyptian pharaoh? Thatâ€™s really how you want to spend the rest of your life?",BaddyDaddy777,2025-05-08T08:20:25,15
"I always find this stuff funny because what are these billionaires trying to save themselves for? Their lives revolve around using their dragons hoard of wealth to lord over us peasants as they jet around the world in the lap of luxury.   These bunkers come with the premise that these narcissistic pathologically greedy oligarchs can suddenly lock themselves in a hole in the ground and not lose their minds.   Personally Iâ€™d be astounded if they manage to last a month before they canâ€™t take it anymore, or their army of servants decides to do away with the dead weight whoâ€™s money means nothing after society collapses.",bestforward121,2025-05-08T08:17:33,15
"I remember listening to Rushkoff on a podcast 4 or 5 years ago. I think it was one of Jon Ronsonâ€™s shows that touched on â€œthe sovereign individual â€œ. Anyway Elons acts sure seemed consistent with the tech bro accelerationists.  Good article, but you need to find another sub for the link as it violates the date rule.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-08T07:49:46,12
Can some enterprising young do-gooder publish the exact location of these on the web?  Kind of in keeping with the billionaire jet tracker?,Adorable-Narwhal-267,2025-05-08T08:14:43,6
"Interesting piece for those interested in some of the ""goals"" of these preppers:  [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk)  Warning- a pretty depressing read.",poeticfuture,2025-05-08T08:30:15,3

"Fascinating article, especially since I am now reading Aurora by David Koepp which is a fictional book on the topic of a magnetic storm wiping out all power on earth for months or years and this one uber rich guy that built a bunker in an old missile silo....",LetThePoisonOutRobin,2025-05-08T09:52:22,1
People build those bunkers know where they are and how to get in them.   Can we convince that it happened so they lock themselves up? Im good with that compromise,haroldthehampster,2025-05-08T19:38:45,1
How? Itâ€™ll be an AI issue.,norby2,2025-05-08T09:15:50,0
"If the world gets destroyed, or economies collapse, all those assets become worth far less and then all they have is a lot of nice, shiny, bullshit that is ripe for stealing.  Even their private security is a threat to them at some point.",KungFuSnafu,2025-05-08T07:52:15,24

Yes. Read the article The rise of end times fascism by Naomi Klein. Share it with everyone you know,bochy992,2025-05-08T07:52:49,2
Yes. These people are sick. You have to understand this.,bochy992,2025-05-08T08:32:45,10
Read Naomi Kleinâ€™s article 'The rise of end times fascism' if you want to understand how this connects to a broader agenda driven by a convergence of ideologies that are banking on the apocalypse.,bochy992,2025-05-08T08:36:59,8
They should read the Masque of the Red Death before feeling too secure in their bunkers.,e_t_,2025-05-08T08:37:19,6
Also look up the Network State idea. Give CEOs land with special economic zone status where laws are flexible so their workers will be living in company land and paid in company cryptocurrency.     I see nothing wrong with giving elon a area where worker and safety regulations are removed in the name of progress. Surely nothing can go wrong here!,Sir_Ruje,2025-05-08T08:39:35,2

more like thousands,haroldthehampster,2025-05-08T19:39:37,1
Read that article too? The slave collar idea and timelocked food safe that they only know the password to is a particularly hilarious idea. It never occurred to them to justâ€¦ be decent humans that their security is willing to not murder the first chance they get ðŸ˜‚.

How else will their slaves know that they're inherently better and more valuable because at one time they held more numbers that no longer have any value?,LocalEquivalent52,2025-05-08T16:12:07,2
I assume the slave collar somehow stops people from trimming them like a hedge?,CephalopodInstigator,2025-05-08T08:39:05,2
Which article is this? I'm interested.,KungFuSnafu,2025-05-08T09:11:28,1
Pretty sure it explodes or shocks them to death. Iâ€™d have to find the article again and itâ€™s too bleak for me to do that.,Aschrod1,2025-05-08T08:39:49,3
