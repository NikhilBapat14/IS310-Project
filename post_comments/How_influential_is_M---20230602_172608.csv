">But is she actually that influential? And if so, is she influential because of her position, or is she influential because of all the attention she attracts?  She's a nationally recognized politician, which is normally pretty difficult for a House Member. There are 435 House members, and most ""politically knowledgeable"" individuals can only name a handful or two by name. Part of this is because of her controversial statements which garnered her national headlines.  She is currently influential due to the layout of the House, where a single House member can trigger a new vote for the House Speaker. She is part of the far-right membership of the House, and used that to get better subcommittees in the House. She is not viewed as an intellectual powerhouse or someone who stands a good chance at a national/statewide election, but is a figurehead for the far-right of the GOP, along with Lauren Boebert.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-05T09:48:57,5
Not very I'm a moderate Republican and I can't stand her so she probably won't get elected to anything other than a 3rd string congressmen.,jcook311,2023-06-08T23:42:20,3
"I seriously doubt either Green or Boebert could pass 10th grade. It’s really very sad. More acting than Hollywood we hope, if not we are in really big trouble.",Etherindependance5,2023-06-06T17:58:37,2
"She’s a shouty poo-flinger.   Good copy for lazy reporters, though",knockatize,2023-06-06T18:51:23,2
I expect her to host a primetime talk show on Fox after she leaves office.,Cheap_Coffee,2023-06-07T11:31:36,2
she only won her election because she is in a +22 R district. She has no chance in a state-wide or nationwide election. Her current position is the highest political office she can realistically obtain.,thatguy888034,2023-06-07T18:06:28,2
"She is answer to a democrats prayer . The face of the MAGAT . There is no demographic that she appeals to that is not already voting for Trump.  The more widely she is know ( especial her prejudice and antics ) the more people will be repelled . She spiiled the beans on all Jewish man have a secret jewish space laser . I have show mine to many women and they said it looks just like a ""penis"" - only maybe a bit smaller. Thank you MTG.",Allanscl9,2023-06-24T14:39:05,2
