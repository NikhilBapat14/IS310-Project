"This is a perfect example of Trump's lack of intelligence and not understanding what words mean, and worse, not caring to find out before he opens his mouth.  Sanctuary Cities aren't sanctuaries for illegal immigrants ot criminals. If you're an illegal immigrant in a Sanctuary City, you're still subject to detention and deportation.   The Sanctuary City is a designation designed specifically as a Crime Reduction effort that allows illegal immigrants to REPORT crimes they may have witnessed, to come forward to help local law enforcement catch criminals, by simply not having their immigration status brought up during police investigation of the crime.  If you get rid of sanctuary cities, you won't be able to talk to as many witnesses of crimes, and you won't catch as many criminals.
