"I think a lot of *good* people are still in denial. A lot of people haven’t truly realized that we’re never going back to how things used to be.  There’s a lot of collective grief, I think.",yesiknowimsexy,2025-05-02T17:02:27,5
"“Dems need to get real” How about americans need to get real. Dems put up a candidate with experience and a plan and america shit all over it. This article should read, “Americans, wake the fuck up, you elected a psychopath.”",Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-02T11:20:50,10
"> I've been in an ongoing conversation with Michiganders since I jumped into public service, and they're very clear about the pain points in their lives. They're very clear about their frustration that they feel like their lives are simply a money grab for greedy big corporations. They're afraid of the insecurity of losing a job and then losing health care or watching as your employer gives you yet more deductible you have to pay to get the health care you already paid for, garnished out of your wages every two or four weeks. They're worried about PFAs plumes in their ground, poisoning their water, or whether or not their air is poisoned by sulfur dioxide from a smokestack next to them. They're worried about whether or not their kids are ever going to be able to afford a home because the quality of their schools seems like it's been deteriorating over a long period of time. >  > We are the richest, most powerful country in the world. The fact that those are shared frustrations of the vast majority of our people is, frankly, gobsmacking, and our politics needs to be about solving that. And I think there are three things we need to do if we’re serious about solving it.   77,000,000 Republican voters wanted Trump. Everyone else couldn't convince enough voters to vote against Trump. That everyone else includes every single Democrat politician.    The voters are there. Democrats have no one to lead them or motivate them to vote. Free country and all that jazz. But what all those not-Republicans want is not a plan. They want to be able to trust Democrat politicians. They want a reason to vote. And whatever you think that that reason is... it is not.  So here we are. Again. Trump in office again but this time Republicans have control and Project 2025. I'm super excited to find out what Dems do in 4 years when it's time for politicians to spend another $16 billion dollars on a Presidential election for Trump and whoever. Should be surprising. /s",tech57,2025-05-02T11:43:11,7
"It's honestly still on the voters.  > I look at these people and can't quite believe that they exist. Are they professional actors? I wonder. Or are they simply laymen who want a lot of attention? To put them in perspective, I think of being on an airplane. The flight attendant comes down the aisle with her food cart and, eventually, parks it beside my seat. ""Can I interest you in the chicken?"" she asks. ""Or would you prefer the platter of shit with bits of broken glass in it? To be undecided in this election is to pause for a moment and then ask how the chicken is cooked.  -- David Sedaris   It's quite frustrating to watch people thrash around looking for a reason -- any reason -- to avoid admitting that their actions (or inaction) led to this. America is suffering from an intense accountability problem.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-02T12:13:18,3
"> It's honestly still on the voters.  No it is not. It's called division of labor. If Hillary and Kamala want to be president they need votes. Voters are not forced to do so.  >The voters are there. Democrats have no one to lead them or motivate them to vote. Free country and all that jazz.  ""All our problems are because voters live in a free country"", does not make sense to a whole lot of voters. See the last couple of elections for recent examples.   >It's quite frustrating to watch people thrash around looking for a reason -- any reason -- to avoid admitting that their actions (or inaction) led to this. America is suffering from an intense accountability problem.  People of reddit suffer from an inability to identify the problem. They are the ones thrashing around while blaming other people. You want to blame voters? Then you need to blame the voters in the US Senate and the US House. Voting is their job.   >“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.”",tech57,2025-05-03T06:17:37,2
"""America is suffering from an intense accountability problem.""  That includes genociders and the people who insisted we needed to vote for genociders in order to stop fascism, instead of convincing their party that genocide support should be simultaneously a morally and politically untenable position.  Democrat politicians and their voters - the ""brunch liberals"" as we call them - bear responsibility for ignoring all the authoritarian nonsense that happens when their side is in charge then having the audacity to act surprised when ethnic cleansing and deportations happen under Trump.  Years of being satisfied with the neoliberal status quo and allowing the Overton window to be constantly shifted right led up to this.",ThaBigClemShady24,2025-05-02T22:05:13,1
