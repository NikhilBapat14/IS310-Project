"All court sessions are presumptively open to the public and the press. People can and do show up and see them in person. Supreme Court conferences, by contrast, where the justices discuss and vote on cases, are closed to all, even their clerks.   And, unlike the other two branches, judges explain the basis for their decisions in their written opinions. Imagine if the president and members of congress had to give reasoned explanations for their decisions.",Fluffy-Load1810,2025-04-17T12:59:31,6
"I'm British, and I just went to our Supreme Court yesterday. It was free to go in (I wasn't even planning on it when I went to London), and we could just walk around the empty courtrooms and see a bunch of shit.  It's wasn't in session at the time, but if it were and there was space, I would have been allowed into the public gallery to watch.  I've also just walked into the public galleries of Parliament while they were in session without pre booking (although if you want to go you should book).  Don't understand why you'd have it any other way.",oeb1storm,2025-04-17T05:19:58,12
"It doesn’t matter because their decisions and conversations will not be public regardless  I am on multiple boards that are subject to the open meetings act, I have never been on one where most of the decisions weren’t made in private conversations- and made “official” in public",RCA2CE,2025-04-17T06:38:42,8
"I think the idea is that Judges and Cabinet members should feel secure to speak freely. Cameras and reporters would heighten the stakes for every mistake or questionable idea. In principle it makes sense.  The problem is there doesn't appear to be a venue where these people are ever truly accountable. Their meetings are private and then when they do give press briefs those are often contentious and argumentative. When are we just getting the truth from these people?  In my opinion anytime an official, acting in their official capacity, makes a statement to the public it should be treated as 'under oath'. There should be criminal liability associated with lying and or just willfully refusing to answer questions. If something is classified and can't be discussed just say so. The other option is to just not hold a public brief in the first place.   This paradigm we have now where all decisions are private and all public statements are a denial is a serious problem. The Govt is supposed to be accountable to the people, period. People have the right to know WTF is happening and why.",8to24,2025-04-17T06:23:56,12
"No.  SCOTUS already has their oral arguments made public, as are all the submitted briefs, and they write extensively to explain their judgements.  With cabinet meetings, the President needs to be able to have candid discussions with their advisors, which you can't do with the press and public present.",bl1y,2025-04-17T14:38:35,6

"I'm all in favor of it. The justices (and lower-court judges) are adults and can police their own behavior. If airing the embarrassingly racist and bigoted stuff that the Republican justices say at oral argument (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/insight-scalias-racial-entitlement-remark-flna1c8736007) makes them look partisan, that's their fault.",Potato_Pristine,2025-04-18T13:24:58,1
"Yes and no.  Historically, the US has swapped between having public and non public votes for members of Congress a couple times, with the most recent change happening with sunshine laws in the 70's.  Prior to that, votes had been hidden from public record for about 100 years and after it was changed we saw the parties diverge as well as the power of special interests increase and a transformation in government where it became Democrats vs Republicans and not Congress vs White House.    Going to non public votes for the House/Senate seem like it could help again right now as that has historically reduced corruption rather than increase it.  The counter argument being that people just like knowing how their reps vote rather than having to trust what they say.  But someone like Trump would have been impeached and banned from office for life all the way back in even 2017 if voting were anonymous.  Much of how the tea party functions, and breaks Congress, would also fail with non public voting.      I do think there should be some increased recording of courtrooms and cabinet meetings for record keeping purposes, but would be fine with those being sealed for 10 years, or until the people involved are out of office (whichever comes first), absent a court order to turn over a specific bit of footage though.      This would strike a balance between record keeping and keeping the public informed while mitigating the ability to play to the camera for current celebrity status or political reasons.",Aazadan,2025-04-18T15:55:39,1

One of the favorite things I did when I studied abroad in London was sitting in on Parliament.

"They've got opinions about how things will likely go before oral arguments, but there's still a lot of decision making that happens afterwards.  When trying to get to a 5 vote majority, there's some negotiating over how broad or narrow to rule and the specific reasoning to be used. They might start with a general idea about the ultimate outcome, but the opinion won't be settled in advance.  There's also rare instances where in writing the opinion, the justices change their mind. There have been outcomes that get flipped because the opinion ""wouldn't write.""",bl1y,2025-04-18T09:22:14,1

I think the issue here is is that no matter how hard you try the end result is usually not that meetings become open to the public but that the meetings become a theater for decisions already made at private meetings. While shining light on these private meetings can be good it can also be bad.
