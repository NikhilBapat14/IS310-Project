"That’s the core of it.   We have our own lil King Joffrey, an emotionally stunted narcissist that is deeply insecure about his own complete lack of intelligence.   And instead of going “Hey, you’re just a stupid kid, it would be INSANE to allow you to be in charge and make decisions,” we let him sit in the Oval Office and shout out imbecilic decrees that can only have been conjured by the mind of a ten year old boy that once saw his daddy’s wiener in the shower and spends the rest of his life worrying about the comparison.",SuperLuigiUnited,2025-05-07T17:24:00,7

At what point do you switch from “oh my god what a terribly behaved child!” to “where the fuck are his parents?!”  This is on the republicans who have the power to end this today.  They aren’t.

In a press conference today he was asked about removing tariffs from strollers. He said he'd have to think about it because he wanted to keep it simple.    What kind of a world is it when people ask the supreme leader to make individual trade items less expensive that he's imposed a massive tax on?

They are so concerned about having the same job in a few years (where they don't actually do the job, they just do what Trump says) that they'd rather watch the country be destroyed than do their jobs and do what their constituents need then to do.

There have been countless kings and emperors throughout history like Commodus, Caligula or Nero whose reigns were objectively terrible for just about everyone and yet they somehow managed to cling to power for years or even decades.  I get that Trump’s inner circle and their friends are profiting immensely off his presidency but at this point he’s pissed off most of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Big Pharma and even the Military Industrial Complex.

"It's fear of his base. Standing up to Trump has never worked out once for a Republican. Until Republican voters are begging for relief from this madness like the rest of us, we won't see change.    They'll come around when things get bad, but they're not going to believe it until they feel the pain personally, because they don't believe any ""experts"" other than Trump himself. ",Frogacuda,2025-05-08T05:18:24,2

"Hey, it's not like there's any accountability. We, as citizens, have the power to stand up and say 'enough is enough'.   They keep us poor and divided, uneducated and blind. We've been coddled by cheaply made gadgets, and we're unwilling to sacrifice what little we have, understandably so. Some of us are truly struggling, and those who aren't are profiting off this forced arrangement. We need to break before we can rebuild.   The world we live in was designed in the 50s. Nothing is the same now. We had a chance to course correct during COVID, but we had a moron at the helm. And we're now, we gave the same moron the helm again, as though we like the abuse.
