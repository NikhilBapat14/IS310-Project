"As the left amply demonstrated multiple times in its lawfare against Trump, his lawyers, and his associates, over the past ten years, a grand jury is not a legal necessity.  We on the right tend to mistake custom for necessity, both when it comes to what should be done and what should be avoided... But the left have become experts at looking at the letter of the law to circumvent custom in order to achieve their desired ends.  We need to start being less concerned about asking ""has this been done before?"" And start doing like the left and instead start asking ""is this forbidden, or is this required, by the letter of the law?""  Grand juries are a perfect example... It is customary to require a grand jury prior to an indictment... But it is not a legal necessity (in most cases at least) to require a grand jury prior to an indictment.",Shadeylark,2025-04-29T05:56:49,-2

I agree that it’s frustrating that conservatives abide by the rules and the left can somehow break the rules while convincing people the rules are wrong and gain empathy and change public opinion that way.  ,49ermagic,2025-04-29T09:41:18,1
