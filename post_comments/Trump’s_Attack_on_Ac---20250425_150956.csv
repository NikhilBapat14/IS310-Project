"Convicted bank fraud artist Peter Bernegger is the source of false claims against ActBlue. The conman calls the scheme Smurfing. His evidence is gobbledygook.   Previously he derailed a Republican investigation into Wisconsin election fraud by making false claims of illegal voting in nursing homes. He had no evidence, just loud claims. His lies ruined the reputation of former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Gableman and embarrassed Republican Assembly leader Robin Vos, who became a primary target by MAGA. Vos barely survived the primary. This past election losing Senate candidate Eric Hovde repeated Bernegger's claims of nursing home residents' vote fraud. Hovde was mocked.

In fact, I think it’s funny you’re even trying to interrogate me on this when it’s something I can spend about 2 minutes on Google figuring out if I didn’t know, so I could just lie to you if I wasn’t already aware about how US politics works.  And all this for the sake of *really* owning me.   I get it. You’re a *really* big fan of neoliberal politics. I don’t think they care even half the amount back toward you or the working class as a collective, or else Trump wouldn’t even be doing a second term right now, but you go.  If you’re going to be ragebaited into donating toward a political org for a party that doesn’t give a shit about you because you want to go fight fascism, then at the least go throw your money into any local causes and go help build community instead of whatever this accomplishes lol.",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-26T09:46:53,1

Democrats still have the power to filibuster legislation, which they should be doing for every single piece of the Republican policy agenda anyway, and they just did a 25 hour filibuster that wasn’t even directed toward any actual legislation and achieved nothing other than giving liberals a feel good moment because it matters that Strom Thurmond had his little white supremacist record.
