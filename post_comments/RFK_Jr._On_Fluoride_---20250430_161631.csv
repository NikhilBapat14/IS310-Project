"From reporter Ryan Grenoble:  As Donald Trump‚Äôs Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy could pursue a rigorous, high-quality study regarding the efficacy of fluoride in drinking water and whether or not it‚Äôs hazardous to our health.  Instead, he‚Äôs glommed onto a flawed study on the matter and now we‚Äôre here, with Kennedy confidently telling the president at a cabinet meeting Wednesday that ‚Äúall the science on fluoride‚Äù agrees that ‚Äúthe more you get, the stupider you are.‚Äù  Here's what he plans to do with that ""finding.""

"The flouride debate is inane. Here's why.  If you live in a municipality that does not flouridate the water yet you want your children or yourself to have the benefits of flouride, simply go down to your local pharmacy and buy some.  I grew up in a municipality that didn't flouridate the water supply so my mother used an eyedropper to put 4 or 5 drops (or whatever the dosage was) in my orange juice each morning. From a bottle of flouride she bought at the pharmacy.  Indeed, I suspect this would be superior healthwise compared to ingesting municipal water that is flouridated. Because controlled doses, I suspect, would yield better results than ""ubiquitous"" flouride.  Pharmacy-supplied flouride makes virtually 100% of the people happy: those that want a ""clean"" non-flouridated municipal water and those that want to enjoy the benefits of flouride.",tkondaks,2025-05-01T07:58:20,1

"In Singapore they also fluoridate their water, and they  rank highest among OECD nations for mathematics and science in PISA scores. Among the top 10 highest scoring countries (which includes Ireland), almost all of them either fluoridate their water or have naturally high levels of fluoride. In Estonia (5th), they have to remove fluoride because their water has natural fluoride levels as high as 7mg/L.
