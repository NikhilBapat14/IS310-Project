Only America could chastise another country for limiting freedom of speech while brutally cracking down on college protests in their own country.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-03T23:16:47,15
"Rubio sacrificing any non partisan equity and reputation he had on to trump’s ego bonfire is amusing. It wasn’t that long ago that republicans remembered the how, why and when of Germany took up the limitations it has chosen on some speech.
