"Yes, they are openly admitting it again just like they used to do. I mean, the civil rights movement wasnt that long ago and there were so many in opposition to Black people having rights, many of them are still alive today and probably raised their families to think the same way. I think the woman who wrongfully accused Emmett Till of whistling at her is still alive.  Also, dehumanization of other races is a large part of how they ""justify"" it. Some people literally believe that other races are not human for instance. It sounds unfathomable to you and me but for them that's how they justify it  I wish I had a direct explanation. It does puzzle me too. But like all extremists they've been taught that their way is correct so that's just.... what they know and think. I don't think they question it, at least, not the weak ones. There probably are plenty of racists that had the ability to question their beliefs and even change them. But my theory is that level of brainwashing is really hard to overcome. I mean within the last 10 years or so we've seen more hate groups spur up than ever before. There are white supremacists that regularly march in the streets now days.
