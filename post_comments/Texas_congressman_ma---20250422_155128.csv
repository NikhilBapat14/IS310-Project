"U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Houston) for those who don't want to click the article.   BS in leadership & management with mechanical engineering from the United States Military Academy.  He flew Apaches for the Army and served once in Iraq and twice in Afghanistan as a diplomatic liaison officer.   After he left the military, he got masters in business administration, public administration, and industrial & labor relations.   He's been a rep since 2022.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T15:58:11,33

Do you really think Trump is going to nominate a black man? The odds seem low. ,Electrical_Room5091,2025-04-22T15:53:13,5
"Eh, I guess Hunt actually has a bit of experience. Maybe he would be a tad less incompetent.",OnlyRise9816,2025-04-22T15:55:17,4
He’s more qualified then Hegseth.,Grizkniz,2025-04-22T16:01:10,3

If he was a democrat than republicans would be screaming DEI hire,This-Gear-687,2025-04-22T16:38:38,1
Well at least he had military experience and an education from west point,Infamous_Ebb_5561,2025-04-22T17:12:48,1
Ssssh! Don't let them know!,loglighterequipment,2025-04-22T16:31:00,7
Probably still wouldn’t like him from a policy standpoint but he at least sounds more qualified than the DUI hire.,TarheelFr06,2025-04-22T17:00:09,17
So he's massively overqualified and therefor will probably get passed over for yet another partisan orange ball gargling news anchor. Good to know.,Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-22T19:17:19,3

I’ve never been in the military and am probably more qualified than the drunk.,Ready_Nature,2025-04-22T16:54:10,4
The animated general from the insurance ad is more qualified than Hegseth,themattboard,2025-04-22T16:38:55,7
I don't know much about Hunt; why is he a stupid choice?   Aside from being a republican I mean.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:01:09,2
"It's so easy to frame it in a way that serves their needs at this point     ""This is an example of how we are not against having a diverse administration.  We are simply a merit-based administration and this brown boy fits the bill.  See?

This is a bad take.  It’s propaganda. There is only one reason you are conditioned to have such a negative public opinion of hegseth.  Do you know why?,Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T16:48:07,-12
I was confusing him with Alan West.  So maybe this guy is more okay.,LeatherChaise,2025-04-22T16:05:27,2
"> There is only one reason you are conditioned to have such a negative public opinion of hegseth.  That’s actually a really tough one, is it the utter lack of relevant experience for the position or the way he’s repeatedly fucked it up by leaking classified information? Are you sure I can only pick one?",Dear_Wing_4819,2025-04-22T17:10:57,5
Why's that,gearstars,2025-04-22T17:04:04,2
"Is it because he’s completely unqualified for the job?   Look at Hegseth’s experience, then look at the experience of Lloyd Austin and James Mattis.   He has no large scale military command or staff experience. He doesn’t have a lot of experience in the civilian side of the DoD or Intelligence communities. He hasn’t run other government organizations.   Saying Hegseth is qualified to be secretary of Defense is like saying that someone is qualified to be the CEO of McDonalds because they were a shift manager for a few years.",wwhsd,2025-04-22T18:49:31,2

Neither one.  You are easily influenced.  Not a critical thinker.  And the govt has been exploiting that at least since information control division to steer public opinion.  The only reason you even mention those is because you were told to form a negative opinion and obediently followed the command.,Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T17:14:00,-9
"Comes down to money only. Pentagon/national security establishment.  By not pushing expensive arms deals, it hurts both sides of the aisle financially.  Everything else is utilized to sow public opinion through media/social networking—but there are far worse cabinet picks.  But if he is good for business, everyone here either has a favorable opinion or no opinion.",Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T17:09:09,-2

"What’s the point?  Reddit rewards groupthink.  Even if you post objective data, it’s going to get hammered very hard by the community.   It’s about feeding echo chambers and dopamine hits here.",Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T17:53:43,-1
"You aren’t giving a compelling reason to like him, your entire argument is that the government (which he is one of the highest level people in) is telling me to not like him. So does he actually have significant qualifications that are being hidden? What are they? Are you saying the repeated intel leaks are just fake news, or are they true but I’m just dumb for caring that they happened?",Dear_Wing_4819,2025-04-22T18:20:58,2
"Enlighten me then, why should I have a positive opinion of Hegseth?",wwhsd,2025-04-22T18:58:14,2
">your entire argument is that the government (which he is one of the highest level people in) is telling me to not like him.   They don’t like him because it impacts their ability to accrue PERSONAL wealth through defense contracts.  It’s like Monsanto telling you how healthy GMO’s are.  >Are you saying the repeated intel leaks are just fake news, or are they true but I’m just dumb for caring that they happened?  Well, I know YOU don’t care.  That opinion was manufactured for you.   But most opinions (even counter opinions) are manufactured too and trickles down for emotional propaganda.",Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T18:42:51,-5
I’m not saying you should.  But your current opinion isn’t even yours.,Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T19:01:13,0
"So in short you have no actual argument why I’m wrong. You’re criticizing me for a lack of critical thinking without providing any evidence that would give me a reason to change my mind and like the guy  Like I said, if you have evidence that the information I’m basing my opinions on is wrong then feel free to provide it, but it sounds like all you have is speculation on the motivations of the media (which Hegseth also was a part of)",Dear_Wing_4819,2025-04-22T18:51:09,2
"First time taking acid or something?   Just learned about manufactured consent?   People are literally basing their opinion on the facts of the matter:   No experience other than in the National Guard.   Self expressed drinking problem.   Poor demeanor and attitude combined with very frightening comments about the laws of war.   Broke the law around discussing confidential plans of military action.   Did it twice for good measure.   You are trying to claim that just because we hear certain things from the media we can't make a critical thinking decision of our own based on the source? When the source has significant evidence to back it up?   So we can't decide anything on our own without being directly involved in the situation and can have no opinion on anything from media regardless of the evidence?   Great- that's super fucking useful- go enjoy YOUR opinion on the things you TRULY know enough to have your own opinion on.. I dunno, the landscaping of your backyard and your Aunt Sally's potato salad cause by your own reasoning, I doubt many of your opinions are your own. ",Lostinthestarscape,2025-04-22T19:10:47,3
You don’t have an opinion.  It’s not your opinion.,Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T18:54:53,0
">You are trying to claim that just because we hear certain things from the media we can't make a critical thinking decision of our own based on the source?  Well, technically you could have formed your own opinion but you did not.  Nietzsche alludes to walking billboards and they’re easy to spot.  They’re reeking of persuasive propaganda.  In this case, a viewpoint is established and then details are added after the fact to enhance conviction to the dogma.   Did you weigh pros and cons and establish criteria for establishing your belief?",Zealousideal_Can372,2025-04-22T19:29:59,1
Don't forget one more reason:  even Hegseth's own mother thinks he's a POS.,Never_Really_Right,2025-04-22T20:32:59,1
"Right, so I should blindly feel the way you tell me to and THEN I’ll be a free thinker  To tell you the truth, I don’t believe you came about your own opinion organically, seeing as how you have a complete inability to articulate an argument to support it  I imagine you got your takes from some niche corner of the internet that made you feel elite and special for buying into what they told you because obviously the more esoteric your sources, the truer they MUST be because only sheep believe in mainstream information, and everyone else on the forum had the same elitist attitude  Now you pat yourself on the back for being the latest in a line of “free thinkers” from 4chan or /r/conspiracy or great awakening or whatever other cesspool gave you this unearned sense of superiority",Dear_Wing_4819,2025-04-22T19:23:39,2
