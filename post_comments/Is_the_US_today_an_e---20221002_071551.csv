"Going by definitions alone, clearly a hegemony.   I don't really agree with the dichotomy you present here since a hegemony doesn't necessarily have to be soft power.   Something can be an empire *and* a hegemony, and historical empires often were. The Roman Empire exercised hegemony over its subjects and allies.  The US is not an empire pure and simple. There may be some confusion over the term because people metaphorically compare it to empires, especially to draw a parallel to the British Empire the US once fought against only to become an ""empire"" of its own. It's imperialistic but not really an empire. But like the Roman Empire, the US, through NATO and other alliances exercises hegemony over its subjects and allies.",TScottFitzgerald,2022-10-02T10:56:54,32
"The US isn’t an empire by even the most generous definition of the word. Even the traditional definition of hegemony implies more direct control than the US actually has, but it’s a much better description.",Karatekan,2022-10-02T14:19:52,8
"The U.S. might have been considered an empire well over a century ago. However, in living memory it has never engaged in any sort of conquest and can't reasonably be called 'imperial'.  The U.S. is definitely 'hegemonic', but this is alongside a broad coalition including most of Europe and a few stray other places like Australia, Japan and South Korea. The purpose of this coalition is largely to ensure stability and free trade rather than impose rule directly over others.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-02T18:23:23,2
"Yes, it is a modern empire and successor to the British. As the British Empire waned in the late 40s and 50s many bases, particularly in the middle east were handed over to the Americans. America has engaged in wars of conquest and expanding a sphere of influence far outside its territorial borders, Iraq, Vietnam. The US had played a key role in deposing dozens of democratic governments over the last century that threatened US interests, and many more that weren’t democratic, replacing them with autocrats that serve US interests. The US has maintained colonies of its own (Philippines, Panama etc) - and US funding and intelligence oversight maintains US-oriented policy across the developed and developing world, from Germany, France, UK, Poland, Ukraine to Korea, Japan and elsewhere, many key think tanks and politicians rely on US funding, and produce reports favouring US interests - serving core US strategic interests such as why Europe hasn’t developed strategic autonomy and is still basically a US puppet. Latin America is kept in the US umbrella through the Monroe Doctrine.  It is an empire or informal empire, as much as the Roman Republic was an empire, Americans just don’t like to think of it that way. There are many academic works on the subject.",jamo133,2022-10-03T02:37:26,2
Why not both?  America is an empire. It's also the world hegemon. The current world order is one originally built after WWII in the West and expanded following the end of the Cold War.     There's a great book called [How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121985-how-to-hide-an-empire) by Daniel Immerwahr if you're interested in reading about the American empire.,[deleted],2022-10-03T03:23:36,2
"You're a bit too absolute in your definitions. Empires can have soft power, global institutions, and alliances. And ""hegemonies"" as you describe have plenty of hard power, and often use force and coercion. Literally any country with powerful foreign policy will use a mixture of these things.  A more classic definition of empire is one that involves territorial expansion, or claiming/annexation of land that was acquired most often through the use of conquest. I would say you could have called the US an empire once, but since the modern era that began after WWII, America is no longer an empire by that definition.    But by that definition, no one is really an empire. Maybe Russia would be trying to be an empire, but even then not really--Russia's claims of annexation depended on an ideological claim that these people/regions are actually Russian and have been Russian all along so it's not so much ""expanding the empire"" as it is ""restoring borders to include all Russians"" which is a subtle but important difference.  I mean, there haven't been any empires like the Roman Empire since the British gave up on India. Even the more modern day empires have all given up on the idea of conquering a foreign people by force and then ruling over them as subjugated peoples. I think it's pretty reasonable to modernize the definition to include all colonial powers and so on...but again, even that is ancient history at this point.",mormagils,2022-10-03T09:47:54,1
"Care to elaborate? Do we really want to say that, say, Germany or France are vassals to the USA? No doubt the USA has outsized influence, but we pay for that with our roughly double military spending, as a percentage of GDP.",Shakespurious,2022-10-02T11:41:15,1
An empire is simply a state that rules over a myriad of peoples and leads them under a coherent rule. The US definitely qualifies under that distinction,IRASAKT,2022-10-02T14:06:03,0
"The US is absolutely an empire, and we always have been. We're not militarily expansionist like we used to be (at least not with the purpose of acquiring new territory to colonize like we did throughout the 19th and early 20th century). We now exert control through commercial and trade relationships, more akin to the ancient Phoenecian Empire or the Dutch Empire.",[deleted],2022-10-02T11:10:52,-6

"Honestly, I didn't really think I'd have to, none of this is new or controversial in political circles. In global geopolitics, the US is considered a superpower, and after the collapse of the USSR is now considered to be the *sole* superpower in the world. Plenty of analysts have called the post-WW2 period Pax Americana for the same reason, I suggest you look into this cause it's been covered plenty and I can't be as exhaustive as I'd like to in a Reddit comment.  I would say anyone's who's permanently on the Security Council has power over everyone else in the UN, and that's just one criteria. Once you add in the US military power, nuclear arsenal, soft power, the number of multinational corporations subject to its laws, its cultural hegemony over global media, the petrodollar etc etc, it's not even close. But as I said there's been plenty of authors that explained and argued it more eloquently and thoroughly than myself over the last few decades.  > No doubt the USA has outsized influence, but we pay for that with our roughly double military spending, as a percentage of GDP.  I don't really get your point here. It costs a lot to have influence as it always has through history, I didn't say it came for free. The discussion is about whether the US has significant influence over others and even you agree it does. Having to pay a lot for it doesn't change this fact.",TScottFitzgerald,2022-10-02T12:24:51,15
"Well they are - the US funds a lot of key think tanks that develop core policy in EU countries, a lot of EU politicians depend on US funding, whether from the NED etc, this has led to a certain narrowing of political horizons in Europe - and why the EU still has such limited strategic autonomy - because it is important to the US that Europe remains in hock to the US - as much as the US is trying to secure the pacific against China.",jamo133,2022-10-03T02:41:54,1
"How? Typically an empire would require ruling over multiple countries of people, and the USA does not do that.",MagicWishMonkey,2022-10-02T16:48:15,6
"I think you're missing my point. Again, going by *definitions* alone, the US is not an empire. Words mean things, and the US is a federal republic, not an empire. It is however a hegemony. So as I said, going by definitions alone it's a hegemony but not an empire.  You'd have to be metaphorical and analogous (which you are in your example) to call it an empire, but it's not *actually* an empire.",TScottFitzgerald,2022-10-02T12:18:14,13
"Both the Phoenicians and the Dutch had numerous overseas colonies, ruled by governors that derived their authority and position to a central government.

An empire isn't solely defined by its system of government. Rome was an empire while it had an ologarchical republic. Britain was an empire while it had a parliamentarian monarchy. France was an empire while it had multiple different republics. The fact the US is a federal republic doesn't preclude it from being an empire.,[deleted],2022-10-02T12:34:25,1
">It only seemed like a pax americana to some Americans who never talk to foreigners. If it was common knowledge in your circle you have a limited circle.  Well that's very odd cause I'm not an American and studied political science. As I said, it's a long established concept. You might not like it, but you can't really deny that it exists. You might want to check up on your political knowledge.   Here's a fairly simple article that summarises the basic concepts. It's wild to me that someone on this sub is this ignorant about a fairly innocuous and long accepted political concept. And that's to say nothing of the many works written about post-WW2 American hegemony, imperialism and globalist policies:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana",TScottFitzgerald,2022-10-03T02:56:11,4

"I didn't think I'd have to spell it out or that you will be this pedantic, but my point is that it doesn't meet the basic criteria of an empire. It's not just about it's governmental structure. It can be imperialistic but not an empire. I think I've made the point several times already, I don't really see this going any further.",TScottFitzgerald,2022-10-02T12:43:47,8
"Rome is considered an empire now since around Augustus but that’s because we use de facto meanings over de jure for that definition. At the time it didn’t recognise this themselves, until around Diocletian when it dropped the pretence. But the US isn’t at this level of de facto vs de jure just yet.   “Empire” requires a dictatorial head of government, usually but not necessarily hereditary. The US does not meet this definition. All the examples you’ve given might be colloquially called an empire (in the case of the U.K. it does technically meet the actual definition) but they don’t actually meet the linguistically understood requirements.  It’s important to point out that simply not meeting the definition of “empire” does not excuse the US from criticism about how they have formed similarly authoritarian relations with other territories, similar to how the Roman republic had these relationships even before they became an empire",Ofabulous,2022-10-02T13:34:51,4
"I was going to list the six or so on the top of my mind, but as I went to check some details, I found [this much longer list instead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change).

An empire is simply put: an extensive group of states or countries under a single supreme authority. In this case the supreme authority of the US would be the Federal Republic. An Empire does not need a dictator or an Emperor to be and Empire. Empire more refers to the influence of a country rather than the actual government of that country or power.,IRASAKT,2022-10-02T14:15:56,-1
"Replace “supreme authority” with “individual or monarch” and you get the Oxford definition. I do appreciate it can be broader than that, but it’s very vague. There’s a democratic element currently to the US which just doesn’t fit properly with any definition of empire. Even if that democratic element is increasingly controlling / authoritarian.",Ofabulous,2022-10-02T14:19:52,1
"I’m sorry, but I use American definitions not Bristish Oxford definitions. The Brits don’t even know how to spell the word color correctly. The presence of democracy does not preclude one from being an empire.",IRASAKT,2022-10-02T14:23:30,-6
Merriam Webster also seems to side with my interpretation. The US is not under a single sovereign authority.,Ofabulous,2022-10-02T14:28:01,3
Then what is the Federal Government if not a single authority of three parts,IRASAKT,2022-10-02T14:32:22,-1
"There’s separation of powers, which stops a single person or institution being sovereign.   I mean you could in theory broaden the definition to “any single ruling body” but in that case all governments are empires, which isn’t very helpful.",Ofabulous,2022-10-02T14:35:32,3
"Most countries wouldn’t be empires, because they do not control a geographically diverse enough area. The UK for example is only an island and a bit of a another island, and Spain isn’t even the whole Iberian peninsula. The US however has the Lower 48, Alaska, Hawaii, and it’s other territories. And the federal government has supreme power over all other bodies in the US, and just because the government has multiple organs does not mean it has supreme power over the country.",IRASAKT,2022-10-02T14:40:16,0
"If you want to define empire as simply the size of the area governed, go right ahead, but as I say it’s not very helpful, and I doubt that’s how the OP was thinking of it  Edit: apologies if that came across as a bit blunt. I feel what’s being missed in your definition is “sovereignty”. Yes the fed is at the top, but there’s no single sovereign. A president can’t overrule the house, nor the Supreme Court. The US might be considered an empire if the president (or one of the other branches) could do these things.",Ofabulous,2022-10-02T14:41:20,3
