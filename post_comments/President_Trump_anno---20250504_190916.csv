Other countries give tax breaks and grants for filming in their country; this is the ""stick"" to counter that ""carrot"".

He's not taking the money from the people who're getting the subsidies but I doubt he cares.  But I think there's a more sinister side here too.  If you prevent your people watching movies made in other countries you stifle that perspective being shown in media.  Trump's been very aggressive in pushing his ""truth"" on the media; movies take a little longer to make so would have a longer lead time but I'd be surprised if he doesn't intend to lean on Hollywood to paint him exclusively in a positive light.

Steel, aluminum, Chinese products, the so-called reciprocal ones based on trade imbalance, everything is only for goods.

Especially today when it's very difficult to turn a profit on a small film. This would essentially kill all small foreign based films. Which is honestly most films..... The permit in some US cities is more than an average films budget.    This will turn into a huge lawsuit. You can't just tariff one media entity.  You'd have to include music, video games, books, art, etc.... the list goes on....   This is literally batshit crazy.....",Prestigious_Fail3791,2025-05-04T21:04:46,2

"  ""It’s not at all clear how such a tariff would be imposed. Films are intellectual property, not goods, so they represent a kind of service that is not currently subject to tariffs. However, the USTR notes that some services can be subject to certain non-tariff trade barriers, such as regulations and tax incentives. Those could disadvantage American filmmaking.  Many foreign cities have offered large tax breaks to film and televisions studios to shoot movies and shows outside of Hollywood. That has led to a large number of productions to shift operations to places like Toronto and Dublin. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a massive tax credit to bring back production to Hollywood""  It looks like he can't just slap a tarrif on an IP so this seems mostly aimed at fucking over Hollywood by forcing them to film in the US",Lunchb0xx87,2025-05-04T21:36:54,2

"I don't really care about the movie portion because I personally don't watch movies, but if Trump goes though with movies then what media will he go after next?  My favorite childhood book series was written by an Australian author. Half of the TV shows I watch are made in Japan, and the other half wouldn't be nearly as good if it weren't for people outside the US. My music collection features artists from Canada, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Latvia, Russia, the Ukraine, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and more. My video game collection includes games from Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, Russia, Israel, Finland, Sweden, Spain, the UK, and more.  The amazing thing about art is that everyone can take their own experiences and turn it into experiences they can share with others. Art can be replicated, but no matter how many times you replicate and recreate the Mona Lisa you can't replicate Leonardo's unique artistic vision.   We are blessed to live in a global society where we can effortlessly share art to billions of people in a matter of minutes, and I don't want a world where we are taxed for experiencing the artistic vision of people who wouldn't have that artistic vision if they didn't live in their own country and have their own unique experiences.",TheIncomprehensible,2025-05-05T09:50:07,2

"I'm a former state film commissioner. We talked at the [AFCI ](https://afci.org/)for years about establishing an American Film Office to oversee this kind of thing. The idea never went anywhere. But the key idea was to have an ambassador to """"""foreign lands"""""" to court the industry. Ya know... Like every other country already does. Such an office would establish federal film incentives to entice shooting in the US.  Sadly, there was no political will for ""subsidizing Hollywood.""  So yeah, it's a real problem. But this deranged rhinoceros of an administration just charged ahead with the most heavy-handed possible approach. A tariff on films shot abroad (some of whom will be American, not international) will force the shrinking US film industry to pay more in production costs. It is literally the opposite of an effective solution.  For Chrissakes... Imagine charging NY production companies to shoot out of state. That doesn't encourage production to shoot in NY. It encourages them to relocate to New Jersey.  You want more of the Arts? You don't tax them. You subsidize them.",Fauchard1520,2025-05-05T13:41:38,2

This could harm American films that depend on international backing to break even. He ignores most CGI is outsourced.

From the 1968 Planet of the Apes to, I don’t know… last year’s Barbie. It has always been a medium, at least in the west, that has had the freedom to express criticism, thoughts, and ideas.  But notice how the “libs” don’t get upset or try to get any pro-christian movies that have wide releases cancelled. It always seems to me like one side may disagree with your views, but has no problem with you having said views; while the other side may disagree with your views, and actively tries to take said views away from you.  2) If someone doesn’t think his actions are authoritarian in nature, even at this point, is beyond me.

"I work in unscripted television, stuff from reality TV to competition shows. There has been a definite trend of the production of shows moving to other countries to shoot. Places like the UK mostly, Costa Rica, and Canada. The reason I hear is that labor is cheaper and that the shows have less of a chance to flip (to become Union shows). Los Angeles is already on the brink of destruction as far as production goes, and I would be lying if I didn't think that something like putting tariffs on these networks possibly wouldn't be a bad idea. I will admit, I know little of the intricacies of this process but Trumps mantra of 'manufactured in the USA' could and should really apply to television and movies, especially when they are American companies every time.

For a long time Hollywood has been used to glorify Obama and Hillary Clinton outside of USA.

I suspect The Donald wants other countries to respond with similar tariffs. That would be in line with a deliberate effort by The Donald to totally obliterate the so-called liberal order.  Neoliberal globalist propaganda projected by Hollywood to countries outside of USA is a part of that so-called liberal order, and I suspect The Donald wants that propaganda to stop.

" Manifesto - by Nemik  There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.  Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they’ve already enlisted in the cause.  Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.  And remember this: the Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.  Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empires’s authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege.  Remember this: Try.",viotix90,2025-05-05T10:03:19,1

"You write up the tariff so that applies to all non US based studios. That gives a pass to US companies shooting in Canada, Ireland, etc... but allows you to penalize non US based studios. Instead of tariffs based on the cost of the product, because that's much harder to regularly determine with a film/show, you put it as a flat amount based on some parameter like length. This allows the market to effectively ban distribution of these products en masse. Because of how the internet work yes we'd still be able to hop on a VPN (for now at least) to say we are in another country and watch anime.

"I worked in a major arthouse theater and all of our movies both digital and analog were received physically. Can't speak for big theater chains, but even our DCPs (Digital Cinema Packages) were physically delivered because the files are MASSIVE, around 300-500 GB. I remember when we would host film festivals, I would always get a briefcase containing the DCPs on drives and shit and when the festival was over we'd mail them back to the sender.  So it's possible he plans on tariffing imported DCP drives and physical reels?? This seems like it'd harm mostly independent or smaller cinemas, because bigger chains don't even have analog projectors to show physical prints, and they are more likely to have the means to receive DCPs purely digitally.",Aegon_handwiper,2025-05-05T17:15:27,1
"Find the ones with foreign tax credits to their name. Means they were produced mostly in those foreign countries using their labor. Then take whatever the tariff amount is from their revenues for the film, which is to be payed first before anybody else sees a dime.   So if a film has a 50 million dollar budget. They get the 20 million back from say Canadian tax credits. Which is going to leave a paper trail. Use that to determine it’s a foreign made film. Garnish the revenues of the film and take the 50 million dollar tariff before letting any additional money start to go to the production companies. So box offices, streaming, vod, all of that doesn’t make any company or investors a dime until the US govt gets their tariff of 100% of production costs in full.

This comes out of the pocket of California taxpayers.  Ireland is already preparing to respond to California's planned subsidies with even more Irish subsidies.  What is the economic tool to combat subsidies? Tariffs.  This is a super rare situation where Trump's inclination to slap tariffs on every problem is the correct solution. I'm not sure what he means by placing tariffs on movies. I don't think he has the ability to reclassify IP or set quotas.  Forget Trump and his tariff madness for a second.

"Actually, the issue is with how films are financed. Most films are financed with some form of debt financing. A sales agent draws up estimates based on the film ""package,"" which is track record of the actors, director, writer, and the genre to generate ticket sales in various domestic and foreign regions. They draw up the sales estimates, and the producers then take that to a lender or studio to borrow against their estimates so they have liquid cash to make the film. It's a bit like a small business loan. US doesn’t account for a large percentage of sales and foreign territories, namely China and India, which are going to always be the most profitable markets. If these territories quit distributing US films, it will effectively devastate producers' ability to make movies because no bank would ever risk the loan. Studio movies self distribute, so there's no feasible way to tariff them anyway. What this will mean is fewer movies being made in general, and people like myself are facing extreme unemployment rates, film adjacent business will fail, and destabilize the countries economy even further.

"As with all things Trump,  yes, it's stupid. A blanket tariff on all foreign films will hurt the US more than help.  Doesn't change that California is losing billions in taxpayer revenue due to Ireland's subsidies of the film industry. California's current solution is to fight back with more subsidies, which only costs taxpayers more. A blanket tariff would be stupid, but ignoring Ireland's unfair trading practices isn't ok either.. It's not just film subsidies.  Ireland is a bad actor. Virtually all fortune 500 companies book profits in Ireland. All big tech IP is owned Irish corporations that are subsidiaries of the US corporation and the US entity merely licenses it license it. Ireland is a tax haven.  If you want to talk about people ""stealing"" from Americans, trade imbalance is the absolute wrong way to look at it. That trade is by choice. But tax havens? Difference story.",unskilledplay,2025-05-05T10:35:02,0
"It's a subsidy. It's the opposite of a tariff. Like tariffs, subsidies can be used to counter unfair trade or cause unfair trade.  What Ireland is doing is costing California taxpayers billions of dollars in lost revenue and tens of billions in economic damage. California is responding by increasing subsidies to bring back production, but that too comes out of the taxpayer's pocket and it will be met with even more Irish subsidies.  When China subsidized the production of lithium batteries and EVs to the tune of nearly $1T, Biden put a 100% tariff on EVs. EU put a 43% tariff on Chinese EVs. When China subsidized the production of tires in a strategic effort to flood the US market, Obama put a 35% tariff on tire imports.  You reap the benefit of exports with fair trade. Most Trump tariffs harm fair trade but when tariffs applied surgically they can be a critical tool to *protect* fair trade.  Subsidies and tariffs, when used like this, create a trade war and nobody wins.  Don't get it wrong, Ireland isn't ""investing in art."" They are also a tax haven. Profit realization of almost all fortune 500 corporations happen in Ireland. Most of Apple's cash reserve of $160B is in a shell company in Ireland and will not be repatriated until it's deployed. Irish tax havens milk tens of billions in tax dollars from US corporations and that comes out of the US taxpayer's pocket.  If you don't like Trump's tariffs then you shouldn't like Ireland's subsidies and tax laws. It's two sides of the same coin.",unskilledplay,2025-05-05T14:06:29,0

But if there's -money for the government- involved it starts to become economically feasible to enforce digital tariffs.  It's the absolute nuclear option for deglobalization and something the fascists really would want; deglobalization allows for countries like the current US to stay in their bubble and further propagandize internally while even restricting outside sources of information.

"I agree it's a confusing mess and a huge overreach from the executive. Here are my best guesses (what a time to be a film guy who used to be an e-commerce guy):  - Physical copies of foreign-made games would be tariffed on arrival based on the wholesale price (I believe most if not all discs for the NA market are manufactured in Mexico)  - Digital copies almost all run through five companies (Sony, MS, Nintendo, Valve, Epic) so that shouldn't be too hard to track down with existing tax enforcement mechanisms. I don't know how wholesale/margins work for digital sales, but let's say the game stores take a 15% cut - the tariff would apply to 85% of the retail price. How would stuff like Steam Sales or Epic's Free Game program play into this? I have no idea. - If a US distributor buys the rights to a foreign film, I assume they would be tariffed on the fee they pay the producer. This is less likely to cause a spike in movie prices than it is to lead US distributors to acquire fewer movies (and acquire less risky/interesting movies when they do).",RoughingTheDiamond,2025-05-05T09:33:50,1

"Well you have just given an idea for how he would do that. Again he’s insane there is no limit to the shit he’ll pull to get his way.   Also he could instruct his people to start collecting on the money these films make. And just call it a tariff. We know it’s not and the companies know it’s not. It’s a tax. It’s processed and collected as a tax. But the president and his congressional lackeys say it is a tariff. So he gets away with it. He obviously gets sued for doing this. And then he loses. At which point he does what he has done with every court case that he’s lost. Ignore the ruling and do it anyways.   He is going to be collecting the money. And short of every republican in congress getting shot. Congress will never stop him. The military and police won’t stop him.
