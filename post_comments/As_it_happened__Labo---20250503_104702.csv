More conservative is better than more liberal. In AU it's a game of inches    I don't know if it was all push back from Trump but I won't dismiss at least some of it.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-03T11:26:49,69

"The theory that Trump caused the ""conservative"" parties in Australia/Canada to lose isn't something that has a way to square every other election since November 5th. Countries with actual right-wing populist parties have performed very well as part of a global rightward shift.  You get to choose between two liberals if you live in Australia, or three liberals if you live in Canada. They're running Mitt Romneys in 2025. Young people aren't turning out to vote for these candidates.  Very much wishful thinking on the part of the left to see this as a new trend. Interestingly, their recent cope for electoral losses has been blaming everything on a ""global rejection of incumbents because of inflation."" Prices are going up still, yet Canada/Australia just reelected their governments.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-03T12:05:14,5
"None of it was push back from Trump, Dutton is just a snake. Worst candidate.  No conservatives I know were interested in Dutton leading the party. He has always been slimey.  This election was between a coward and a snake. Rough choices for us.",RossBot5000,2025-05-03T19:06:06,2
I don't think Australia has a truly conservative party. Just varying shades of liberal.,Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-03T11:02:40,29
