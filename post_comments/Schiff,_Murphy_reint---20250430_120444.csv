It’s probably way to late now but if there had’ve been a solid pro-gun caucus in the Democratic Party over the last 30 years, there is no way the GOP, particularly the tea party and later MAGA would’ve ever gotten the foothold that they achieved in the electorate.   This is how they lost blue collar and rural voters…more than anything else. MANY of those people turned their back on the dens because of this one thing.   None of their anti gun shit has achieved anything anyway while literally handing voters to the GOP on a silver platter over the last three decades.

"Fun fact, all the original AWB did was make those guns far more popular. Telling someone that they can't have something is a really good motivator to making them want it. Prior to the ban the AR-15 was a fairly niche gun owned by a small number of people. They only accounted for 1-2% of gun sales. Today that number is 20-25%, with a big motivating factor being the fear of losing the ability to own them in the future. Despite their popularity, these guns are responsible for a miniscule portion of overall gun deaths. Of gun murders, the FBI report about 90% being committed with handguns, vs 4-5% by rifles of any kind (not just the scary black ones). Rifles are responsible for so few murders, that if a ban prevented every single one of them, it wouldn't make a measurable impact on the overall murder rate. I don't know the numbers for suicides or unintentional shootings, but it's far easier to shoot yourself with a handgun than a rifle either intentionally or by mistake.",CombinationRough8699,2025-04-30T22:55:07,5

"I guess someone who throws “cult” around so rampantly would be in impervious to nuance, but if you look at actual AWB laws you’ll understand that the definition varies.    The only feature common to all AWBs I know of is the pistol style grip.  The same weapon is often fully legal without that one feature, so “fashion” is kind of your anchor.  Not mine.  Yes I think if a rifle of a known caliber, velocity, concealment, etc is legal without a nice grip it can be legal with one.  And AWs, as defined that way, are rarely the most dangerous in *any* of those categories.  That’s why they are used in less than 3% of gun crimes.
