"Ah yes, I’m sure they will find that waste, fraud, and abuse by harvesting all our personal, deeply sensitive information.  As per usual, the party of projection is telling us that it is, in fact, themselves who plan to perpetrate the acts they are accusing everyone else of doing.",TheEvergreenMonster,2025-05-02T17:18:20,16
The Social Security Administration has its own internal checks and balances against fraud... Which Trump defunded.  Musk being able to access to sensitive data was always the point.,Grey_0ne,2025-05-02T17:30:21,12

"**Summary**:   The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to let Elon Musk’s government efficiency team access Social Security records, arguing a lower court’s injunction harms federal priorities. A judge required privacy safeguards before sharing data. The administration claims the ruling obstructs fraud prevention. The Court gave challengers until May 12 to respond. Similar clashes have arisen over immigration and data access under Trump’s policies.",pharrt,2025-05-02T17:08:37,4
"I'm not well versed in the technicals of the court, but isn't that not the way it works? You can't actually ask the supreme Court anything directly, it has to go through lower courts until they suss out that there are constitutional issues that need to be taken up?",nimbus57,2025-05-02T17:27:37,4

Who cares what the court says,Alwaystired254,2025-05-02T17:08:13,-5
"NAL but here's my understanding:  The district (lower) court made a ruling that limits DOGE's access to social security records and requires personnel to undergo training for dealing with sensitive data first. The Trump administration is appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court (which is the way these things move up from lower courts). Meanwhile, there's an injunction in place barring access to the data while the appeal plays out. The administration doesn't want to wait, so they're now applying to the Supreme Court for a stay of the injunction (to let DOGE access the data while the appeal plays out). The article is just explaining this in layman's terms when it says, ""Trump asks the Supreme Court...""",realrechicken,2025-05-02T18:46:52,5
