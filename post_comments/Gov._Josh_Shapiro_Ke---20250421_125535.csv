"You'd be mistaken to assume after he was blocked for VP and now had his home attacked for his religion that perhaps he would see the insanity of his party... he has no true morals. A true blue politican. Willing to give up anything for the party, not the people.",itsgotoysters,2025-04-21T14:22:48,10

"Gov. Shapiro has refused to discuss the motive for the attack even while Democrats, including supporters of campus Hamas activists like Halie Soifer, who heads the Jewish Democratic Council of America, blame Trump for an attack by one of their own people. This bait and switch depends on Shapiro keeping his mouth shut even as Dems attack Trump for not saying enough about the attack by a terrorist supporter.  Society has issues, but in this case, Gov. Shapiro is trying not to talk about what happened because condemning antisemitism and support for terrorism within his own party is a career killer.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-21T13:12:11,3
