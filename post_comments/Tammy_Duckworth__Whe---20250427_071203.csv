"It is up to 3 small children, 2, 4 and 7.  Wake up people!!!

"STOP USINGNTHE WORD DEPORTED, its criminally inaccurate to what is going on.   They are BEIMG RENDITIONED. thats when you tale a citizen of your own nation and make them stateless (as they're no longer 'citizens' of your nation after being renditioned.   Jews, disabled, LGBTQIA+, unhoused ('gypsies'), the elderly and infirm... they were ALL RENDITIONED by nazis.   My grandfather had a family before the holocaust. His toddler was dashed on a lamppost before the cattle cars, and ONLY HE survived. Wife, his mom, and EOGHT CHILDREN who HAD been citizens of Germany and Poland, were murdered.  Thats where we are going.",ZoomZoom_Driver,2025-04-27T16:12:44,16

"Just staying focused on the economy did them a whole lot of good in the 2024 election   Does the entire democratic party need to be out fighting this?   No.  But they absolutely should have a handful of that can be out there spreading the word on what,how,why etc etc the republican and MAGA is doing and just how illegal and unconstitutional it is and the impact it will have    Some article from the ACLU won't have nowhere near the reach and impact that a couple democrats could have and still have plenty of dems fighting/focusing on other issues",kpofasho1987,2025-04-27T15:20:35,3

"I am referring the DEM politicians in Washington and their messaging right now. Bc in my opinion in this moment the tariffs and inflation is the message that is breaking through with the general public who we most need to sway right now.   Trump is still getting higher marks for handling the border and immigration.  I expect to get downvoted. And I do not mean it is not important. (I still think abortion is  important but it is not the messaging coming from Washington politicians right now bc it does not have traction right now.)  I do mean that the news media, courts, aclu, immigration lawyers/advocates are keeping the deportation story in the forefront and are effective messengers. We are headed for confrontations with Supreme Court rulings over illegal deportation, birthright citizenship, alien enemies act. This story will stay in headlines without help from pols.",Cluefuljewel,2025-04-27T12:04:50,0
