Shelters are hell. There's massive theft plus assault and S/A. It's no fucking world wonder that many in late stage homelessness turn to drugs when trauma after trauma are being hurled their way by a country that wants to melt them for biomatter while said country glazes the super wealthy that make quality of life more shitty every year for all of us,yungstinkleton,2025-04-26T13:56:33,1
"I agree. The hub of my county has ran the homeless off of several spots. They either confiscate their tents and they're left walking with no place to sleep or go in inclement weather or they can be taken to the jail, have their photo taken and go to a shelter where their time is limited, they have to quit drugs, drinking and/ or smoking cold turkey and they have to attend services at a certain church. Some of them complained a couple of years ago that the shelter was taking their foodstamp cards and they could not request certain foods, even if they have dietary restrictions. Of course most people see no problem with any of this. ",No_Discipline6265,2025-04-26T05:59:41,28
"While I agree to an extent, as a native Californian, I almost don't care about the homeless at all.  I work part time and I see shoplifting happen, at minimum, 2 dozen times. Yes you read that right. And I'm usually scheduled at closing, so that doesn't even include the amount it happens before I start. The majority of the perpetrators are homeless. Even the ones who aren't are still lowlifes living on the fringes of society.  I've had one homeless guy threaten to bash my teeth in because I confronted his shoplifting gf weeks prior. We've had one homeless shoplifter pee on the floor because the restrooms were out of order.  Obviously, I am completely aware that not all homeless people are like this. But when you work in that kind of environment, you'll start to get fed up. I have a few homeless customers who I'm friendly with and I hope they get the help they desperately need, but as for the rest? No tears shed from me if something bad happened to them.",Victorian_Rebel,2025-04-26T20:09:48,-4
"True.  And then the big blue cities get put down by knot-heads like Elon Musk for having so many homeless living in vacant lots and alleys.  At least blue states spend money and try to deal with homeless people in a humane way, don’t always succeed but at least they give it a good try.",Basic_Quantity_9430,2025-04-26T10:53:25,7

"The amount of luxury apartments being built in the hub of my county is unbelievable. I just wonder where the elected officials think people are going work at that will allow them to afford the rent.  We looked online at this one apartment complex that's almost complete and the smaller units are $1900 a month. A job paying $15 an hour is considered a good paying job. Almost 2,000 people in my county and surrounding areas just lost their jobs when the factories they worked at shut down. ",No_Discipline6265,2025-04-26T07:38:11,6

Companies also don’t care about the cost of living. Many use “cost of labor” as a calculation for pay even for salaried employees. So here soon no one can afford to live anywhere.,bioszombie,2025-04-26T07:55:36,6

"I know this comment is facetious, but the guy you’re replying to isn’t wrong.   I’m in Michigan and I’m homeless. The shelters near me suck. Multiple hour long lines to get in the building. Hour long line for breakfast or dinner (fair enough here, if you need free food waiting is an acceptable price), get kicked out in the morning and can’t reenter until late afternoon, they check your bags at night (and the room they’re stored in has been robbed by other homeless people breaking in and by employees), you get your bags checked, a full body pat down, blankets thrown away, vapes/cigarettes/lighter confiscated, subjected to xray machines, can’t bring in liquids or outside foods at all.   Maybe that all seems easy, but when you’re homeless a lot of these things feel like your lifeline.   I was outside in a sleeping bag over the winter through the weeks when it got to -6F/-15C covering and sealing myself close to the ground with a large quilt because it was genuinely easier than dealing with the shelter and being unable to have blankets to warm myself up with during the day or being sent outside in the morning when it was still freezing. With windchill it sometimes got to -20F feels like.   And that’s only speaking on the institutional part of things. I haven’t begun with dealing with some of the workers who treat you like abject scum or some of the more disreputable homeless. I’m 26 and it’s stressful being in close proximity with sex-offenders, rapists, and people who appear to be tweaking out on drugs, shaking and pacing and speaking to themselves.   These people still deserve help of course, I wouldn’t want them to have it even harder, the goal should be reacclimatization into society, but the spectrum of homeless people is very broad.   It’s not really helpful for me if I get panic attacks and flashbacks to hiding from my abusive father at night while people are pacing next to my bunk bed acting agitated and muttering.   It’s also just dangerous to quit drugs good turkey. Depending on what they use that could literally kill them. When I stayed at the shelter last someone died in a personal room for people in a special program from a heroin/fent related problem and they didn’t find him for multiple days until the stench of his decaying corpse in the heat warranted other homeless people complaining of the smell.   I shouldn’t have to explain how terrifying it is to trust your well being in a place like that.",ChilledParadox,2025-04-26T07:32:15,28
"Making someone quit without assistance is cruel. Many homeless people do not become addicts until they've been homeless for a while. Who wouldn't want to escape reality or feel better when living so uncomfortably? The church they are required to attend is part of a community organization that has been fighting against a medically assisted treatment facility that has bought a building and plans on opening. People here have complained about the opioid epidemic for years and for the first time heroin has made its way here, but they claim the facility will ""cause crime"".  It makes me wonder if they'd allow them to stay in the shelter if they're receiving MAT. ",No_Discipline6265,2025-04-26T07:29:56,7

"Maybe you live in an area where the homeless are saints, but I can't say the same. Why have sympathy for them when all they are is a menace?  Again, I'm aware not all homeless people are like that, but spend one day where I work, you'll change your tune. Let's see your sympathy when they're threatening you, shoplifting, making a mess, asking other customers to pay for their stuff then not even saying thank you, etc.",Victorian_Rebel,2025-04-26T22:14:40,0

"You don't need to get involved directly, it's not your store it's not your problem it's the police department and their officers You feeling this type of way and expressing it and looking at them it's just like eating food off the floor or garbage can It's making you sick Just as sick as the -shoplifters- you hate  Hate is hate there is no justification for hatred it's your choice, that makes you just as low as any lowlife",FirefighterNo2786,2025-04-27T00:28:25,3
But doesn’t have to be. Set the maximum a corporation can own of any residential home to 2. And for every home they own past that a 75% tax on income they receive from it and earn selling the property. Make it so individuals own homes. And also set the total number of homes anyone person can own to 2 with the same penalty. Then fix starter home prices to be less than 100k,bioszombie,2025-04-26T09:36:54,1
Do you have any studies on how these policies would drive down housing prices?,heeleep,2025-04-26T10:10:05,3
"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (2022 study): Found that corporate landlords (like Invitation Homes, Blackstone, etc.) drive up home prices by outbidding individual buyers and turning houses into rental income streams instead of homes. Result: Fewer homes available for first-time buyers, higher prices for everyone. 	•	Urban Institute (2022 report): Showed that institutional investors target “starter homes” in particular, the exact type you want to protect. These homes become part of rental portfolios, permanently removing affordable ownership opportunities.  Here is what I found",bioszombie,2025-04-26T10:55:37,3
