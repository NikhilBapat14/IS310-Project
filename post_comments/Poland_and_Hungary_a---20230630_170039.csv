"Since no one else is here, I'll give my  take:  Poland and Hungary used to have a common interest in protecting their national sovereignty against EU norms. However (this will be important later), Hungary broke way more norms, and more fundamental to democracy, such as removing the judiciary's independence and controling national media. Meanwhile, Poland broke fewer, less fundamental norms, such as wanting Polish courts to overrule EU ones and discriminating against queer people.  This is because Poland's opposition to EU norms came from traditionalist catholicism, whereas Hungary's came from illiberal authoritarianism.   Poland, since it became independent from the USSR, has always strongly opposed Russia (as the geopolitical heir to the USSR, responsible for oppressing Poland for decades), and the Catholic Church played a leading role in resisting the USSR, so that traditionalist catholics doubtlessly support the current democratic system against the previous one (embodied by Russia).  Hungary, under Orbán, has gradually drifted away from the liberal-democratic norms of the West, moving towards certain illiberal, authoritarian tendencies. Over time, that has led to a growing tension between Hungary and the EU, accompanied by a relatively friendly relationship towards Putin and Russia (through brotherly illiberal authoritarianism, albeit a more radical one).  Thus, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine focused the political lens on Russia vs western democracies, Poland didn't hesitate to become a leader in backing Ukraine at all levels (taking more refugees, supplying more money and arms, etc...), whereas Hungary spread Russian propaganda and disinformation against Ukraine and blocked/ignored joint EU/NATO action in support of Ukraine (sanctions, providing aid, arms, etc...).  And that is how Russia has caused the fundamental differences between those two perspectives to come to the forefront, eclipsing the circumstancial overlap is resisting some (distinct) EU norms. They are now less likely to cooperate against the EU, due to strong Polish opposition to anything Russia-friendly (aka Orbán's Hungary). Russia has united the West in opposition to it, but Hungary increasingly seems to no longer be a part of that West.",Jtcr2001,2023-07-01T04:14:23,12
"I think that the main reasons for the divergence between the Hungarian and Polish treatment of Putin's Russia can be found in modern politics and economics, particularly since 2010. When Orbán came back into power that year, Russia's model of an 'illiberal' or 'sovereign' democracy was a useful example for his overhaul of the Hungarian political system. Russia also proved helpful in delivering economic support in the form of cheap energy.   Poland instead relied mostly on domestic coal for its energy needs, making it a lot more independent from Russia. Politically speaking, the Polish government has tried to overhaul the Polish system in a similar way as Hungary, but got a later start (2015) and found more domestic opposition along the way. Using anti-Russian sentiments has been a way to create an alternative common enemy. These sentiments have been compounded by their personal connections to the victims of the [Smolensk air disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smolensk_air_disaster) and the way Russia has treated the historical memory of the [Katyn massacre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)  That said, there are longer running historical reasons for this divergence as well. When it comes to the historical narrative of their nation and nationalism, Poles and Hungarians have had substantially different interactions with Russia in the past. Although both share a narrative of being the [last bastions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antemurale_myth) of true Christianity (meaning Catholicism) in the east, only Poles have had a long history of large scale [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_conflicts_involving_Poland_against_Russia) with Moscow-based empires and experienced their country being [wiped off the map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland) or [radically changed borders and expulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_Poland_immediately_after_World_War_II), at least in part due to Russians/Soviets.   Anti-Russian sentiments among Poles are more understandable with the experiences of the [November Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_Uprising), the [Miracle at the Vistula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)), Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and [1939 Soviet invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_Poland_annexed_by_the_Soviet_Union), the [1944 Warsaw uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising) and the Katyn massacre mentioned above. In this light, Russia's threats to wipe Ukraine off the map and willingness to annex Ukrainian territory and wage a brutal war on the Ukrainian people looks very relatable to Polish experiences with Russians or Soviets in the past. Many Poles fear(ed) that Putin wouldn't stop after Ukraine and that Poland could be next. Ukrainian national survival and success in the war therefore seems paramount to Poland's security as well.   Hungarians have had experience with fighting against Russians/Soviets though, in 1848, both World Wars and of course the crushing of the [1956 Hungarian Revolution/Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956), but these seem not to have led to widespread anti-Russian sentiments. Interesting as to why that might be. Perhaps because many oppositional Hungarians could flee or because the Soviet invasion was quick and backed by other Warsaw Pact members? In any case, Hungarians seem not to draw the same conclusion from the Russian agression against Ukraine as the Poles do.   On pro- and anti-Westernism, Poland and Hungary have also had different historical experiences. Due to the victory of Western allies in World War I, Poland reappeared on the map as a sovereign country, whereas Hungary [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trianon_Syndrome) a lot of territory with the Treaty of Trianon. Poland's main fear is that Western allies lose the will to fight or provide military support, as in Munich 1938 and that Poland may become the next victim. Hungary's main fear is that it gets trapped in an escalating war against its wishes and so does not want any bellicose statements from the West.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2023-07-01T12:03:28,4

"> These sentiments have been compounded by their personal connections to the victims of the Smolensk air disaster   To elaborate, the leader of Poland's ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, believes Russia was behind the downing of the aircraft, and, therefore, directly responsible for the death of his twin brother, Lech Kaczyński, the late former president.  Mr. Orbán has no such experience to inform him one way or the other.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-07-01T23:25:21,3
