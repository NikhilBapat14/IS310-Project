"Science will always prevail. No amount of anti-intellectualism can stand against truth, no matter how much it tries to smother or erase it. Principals of matter and nature were here before this craziness, and it will be here long after we are gone.  For US science, we may fall behind as long as this administration is in place.

"*In some agencies, the intent seems to be to “cut until they can no longer deliver on their mission”, says Rachel Cleetus, a climate-policy researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She points to lay-offs at the National Weather Service (NWS), which have hindered its operations and forecasting capabilities. If the NWS could not function, it would then be easier to dissolve the agency altogether, which would open the door for private weather services to take its place, says Cleetus. “They want to privatize a lot of these essential public goods.”*  With the country in the midst of tornado season, and hurricanes up next, impacts from cuts to the NWS and FEMA have already had a detrimental effect, as Sarah Huckabee Sanders found out.",AccomplishedScale362,2025-04-29T15:28:56,2
