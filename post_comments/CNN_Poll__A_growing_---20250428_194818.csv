Overwhelming majority is suffering from his games. Just maga not admitting it,kulukster,2025-04-28T19:53:39,30
Its just a plain fact that his actions have worsened the economy. Those who are saying otherwise are ignoring the facts or do not know the facts.,sedatedlife,2025-04-28T20:06:11,21

"I feel like way too many Americans are just acting like Trump is a bad president rather than an existential threat to freedom and humanity. Like, what can we do at this point and not feel burnt out by the endless barrage of decisions designed to immiserate us to endless wage slavery and a dying planet?",toekneevee3724,2025-04-28T19:52:05,16
of of the things I find most stupid is that trump consistently refers to how well tariffs worked for America in the 1840's.. A time when Cotton was americas major export & slavery was very much alive & kicking.,pixelwhip,2025-04-28T22:25:21,7

"While I'm glad the majority thinks the economy is worse, it seems weird that they were even asked in the first place. The economy getting worse isn't just an opinion - it's verifiable. With numbers and everything.",checkyminus,2025-04-29T01:10:12,2
"“Growing majority” is kind of a sketchy claim at this point, (they’re predicting future results based on?  . . .) but I agree anyway.  Bloomberg has a free youtube channel and since April 3th it’s been one financial expert after another citing what a disaster Trumps brain farts are going to be for the world economy. These are Goldman Sachs level serious people who run money for the ultra wealthy and have degrees and tons of experience, not Sunday morning political talking heads.   Most predict recession for the US and severe economic disruption worldwide. We’re so fu*ked . . .  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f39oHo6vFLg",jpmondx,2025-04-29T05:12:19,2
