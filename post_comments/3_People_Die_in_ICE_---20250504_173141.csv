">What are the rates between the two? Dead divided by Detained  No that's stupid. How long was each held? To suggest that Biden's rate was higher because 26 people died over 4 years vs 7 in 3 months shouldn't even pass the smell test of a critical thinker   Plus your own numbers demonstrate that more people are dying in less time. Let's take your numbers for what they are.  In Trump's case he has 7 deaths with 158,000 people over 100 days. Thats 7/15,800,000 person days or  one death every 4.43037975e-7  per person per day.  In Biden's case he has 26 deaths with 273,300 over 1460 days. That's 26/399,018,000 person days or  one death every 6.51599677e-8 per person per day.  Which rate is higher? Spoiler it's Trump by more than an order of magnitude. In fact if we use trumps current rate and assume he arrests just as many people as Biden did over his four years were looking at 177 deaths.   Rather than using Biden detainment numbers let's assume Trump arrests half of the 20 million people he's promised to round up.  That's 10 million people. Let's even throw Trump a bone and assume those people are only detained for 90 days. Thats 900,000,000 person-days. At Tumps current kill rate were looking at nearly 400 deaths. If each person is detained for 180 days that doubles to 800 deaths.  Maths a bitch ain't it.  >But I don’t think this is coming through as “this is a concentration camp” for critical thinkers  You think wrong. Anyone who knows math would know better and critical thinker would not only understand that but contextualize this information in the current political climate.   Not to mention they'd question where you're getting your numbers.",NeanaOption,2025-05-05T00:42:41,2

"I’m not sure what G.I.G.O means, but I went back to review my numbers and there are mistakes:  For death reporting: https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting. For FY22, FY23, FY24, FY25 it’s 3, 4, 12, and 7, respectively, although 4 of the 7 died before Trump and 2 of the 3 remaining died just days into his presidency. So that leaves us with one from that report (February) with 4 more recent for a total of 5.   And the detained by fiscal year, page 23: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2024.pdf  Side note, Google did me dirty (yikes) and gave me 273k for the entirety when that was just FY23. FY22-FY24 was 862,711 and 158,000 for Trump so far, although I’m not too confident in the source for that (El Pais?).  But if you want to calculate by average daily population, by month, I had to eyeball (FY22-FY25) as 25k, 32k, 37k, 39k. Same source as right above, page 25.  Anyway, under the many different ways you slice it, most favor Biden but some favor Trump.   The point is that this isn’t living up to the concentration camp narrative being pushed here, and that both Biden and Trump and all Presidents have had unfortunate deaths under the their watch. And I think honest reporting should make those comparisons. ",whatisgoingontsh,2025-05-05T13:13:59,2
"Numbers come from ICE: https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting  I agree, factoring in days is probably the best way to do it but short term fluctuations can skew those rates. There was a period in 2024 where Biden had the same amount of deaths with about the same number of detainees. It would be dishonest to extrapolate that rate to his entire presidency if the conditions were the same (meaning, if it was actually the beginning of his presidency instead of the middle). But if the numbers hold for Trump (your calculation of 400 dead or anything even close to that) then we have a problem.  The critical thinking I’m referring to is taking all factors and assessing the likelihood that we have a concentration camp situation or if this is just another headline to stir people up, understanding that this would not even be a blip on the radar for the media (maybe outside of Fox News) under the Biden administration.",whatisgoingontsh,2025-05-05T10:53:30,0
