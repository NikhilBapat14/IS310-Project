Why does that even matter? It  doesn't matter to him or the MAGAs. He can implement many disruptive rulings because the US Constitution allows a president defacto king powers before the Senate and Congress can stop him and by then they may not be able to.  Not a popularity contest but an authoritarian takeover and Americans are worried about whether he will go down in history as a liked president? Bizarre.,Fritja,2025-05-03T14:50:53,416

The Civiqs data shows 51 percent in the state disapprove of the president and 45 percent approve—a margin of negative 6 points against Trump. An additional 4 percent said they neither approve nor disapprove.  >- The president is 4 points underwater in Michigan, with 50 percent of the state disapproving and 46 percent approving. An additional 4 percent of Michiganders neither approve nor disapprove.  >- Trump's approval rating in Nevada stands at 47 percent while his disapproval rating is 2 points higher, at 49 percent. As with the previously mentioned states, 4 percent of respondents neither approve nor disapprove.  So in the swing states his approval ratings are slightly under 50/50 with a slim majority disapproving. When an article says ""underwater"" it makes it sound big/grand.

"Honest question: Why do US Americans care about Gaza? I don't understand it. Since you were involved in the Harris campaign in your own capacity, could you please give me a hint?  The way I see it, Gaza is one of a dozens of horrible humanitarian crises inflicted by a close US ally who one may argue went too far in their right to self defense. But so many US Americans don't even care about the war in Ukraine which also comes at a horrific loss of life but also has a vastly larger impact on the US and their global interests as well as the collective global West. At the same time, I have my doubts there are millions more Palestinians in the US than Ukrainians. And the average US voter would likely struggle to locate either region on a world map, let alone reproduce any substantial knowledge about it or the conflict.  So why do US Americans somehow care about Gaza so much? What am missing?",RaccoonWannabe,2025-05-03T19:24:18,7

Speaking out about the obvious gets you jailed, sent to a work camp, killed, or all three.   3) We do have elections but the Heritage Foundation has rigged everything enough to make them look legit, putting up a pre-selected candidate each time. Elections are always fair but always republican or they start putting up dems.   4) By some miracle, we do have them again because of a mix of 47’s own incompetence, inability to defeat the courts, and concern over maintaining his image to feed his narcissism.

"Social media. It's as simple as that.    Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter... the Gaza situation was all over the place in the lead up to the election and since voters have the memory of a goldfish, they suddenly cared about it more than anything else because it was in their face all the time.    Obama showed that social media could win an election, Trump 2016 showed that social engineering could fake a grassroots movement, and Trump 2024 showed that people will focus on whatever is directly in front of them first and foremost. Notice how the Gaza stuff online suddenly got a lot quieter after election day? That's because it didn't need to be amplified anymore since it had served its purpose.    I specifically mentioned young voters and Gaza because they're the ones who were targeted. College kids felt like they were supporting a just cause and held strong convictions about it. They actually believed that witholding their vote was a threat or that it would ""teach the DNC a lesson"". An idealistic crusade they wouldn't back down from.

If we look at the numbers, turn-out was slightly lower from 2020 (-2 million voters), which isn't too surprising considering the 2020 is literally a statistical anomaly in that regard.  The majority of Americans weren't swayed by the Gaza issue. The Harris campaign simply sucked, and was more focused on the losing strategy of trying to flip Republican voters than engaging with the Democratic coalition.  It's basically the same mistake that was made by Clinton in 2016: take Dem votes for granted, campaign on getting closer to Republican policy, and then act surprised when Republicans keep voting for the real thing, Leftists no longer support you because you've shifted too much to the Right, and working class people simply feel abandoned by the party and don't bother to vote.",David_the_Wanderer,2025-05-04T09:49:42,2

They identify with their leader as he reflects their character, so any power he gains they imagine to be theirs. When he frustrates or harms his enemies, they see that as their ""revenge"" on theirs by proxy. You see sycophants; they see a strong leader dominating his environment. You see the breakdown of the rule of law, they rejoice in it because they reject the principle of equality that underpins it.

"Honestly, I think that there's a strong likelihood that that's where we are headed.  The roots of that conflict would go all the way back to the Reconstruction period of the first Civil War, where ideological differences were just kinda papered over in the interest of short-term peace. And you can trace the stages of ratcheted-up animosity and aggressiveness from there:  * 1950's - civil rights and particularly *Brown v. Board of Education*, which provoked Republicans to dig in on segregation, and lose, and never get over it.  * 1970's - the War on Drugs as a deliberate war on hippies and blacks according to [Lee Atwater](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/), and the Watergate break-in, as a political crime against Democrats that was so appalling that even half of Republicans supported Nixon's resignation.  * 1980's - the Reagan ""Moral Majority"" as an overtly political religious movement, sparked by the bipartisan compromise decision of *Roe v. Wade*, and responding with political warfare including a deliberate refusal to do anything about AIDS that was killing huge numbers of gay Americans.  * 1990's - the Rush Limbaugh era that spent nearly a decade whipping up anger at the Clintons, every day, over largely manufactured grievances and naked political tribalism: ""Hate these people because they are liberals."" Full stop.  * 2000's - the rise of Fox News and the ""if you're not with us, you're with the terrorists"" rhetoric whipped into a fever pitch after 9/11 to legitimize actual torture, warrantless wiretapping of Americans, lying to Americans to instigate a war over manufactured evidence, and all sorts of ghastly behavior up to and including Abu Ghraib.  * 2007-2016 - Republicans spent eight years whipping up anger over Democrats based on a host of manufactured grievances: Qanon, and birtherism, and Benghazi, and the birth of the antivaxx movement, and something about Eric Holder declaring martial law and violating habeas corpus, and Pizzagate, and of course Servergate. And just for funsies - all kind of revolting racist attacks on the Obamas that continue to this day, including persistent rumors that Michelle Obama is a man.  The overarching theme in this 70-year-long tale is growing tension between Democratic politicians trying to achieve societal progress, solve governance problems, and generally strengthen the nation... and a GOP addicted to corruption, Christofascism, white nationalism, conspiracy theories, and a bottomless, all-devouring appetite for grievance and revenge.  We've spent 70 years trying to disregard, resolve, or at least tolerate and cope with this tension. All of those tactics have failed, epically, leading directly to the intensifying crisis of today. The Trump administration has pulled out all the stops and is maximally sprinting toward a nation-engulfing conflict that will likely be enormously destructive and probably extremely violent.  On the one hand, I believe that 75% of Americans don't want what this administration is selling, and when push comes to shove, they will come down on the side of democracy. On the other hand, the biggest obstacle to that movement is a Democratic leadership that is squarely on board with appeasement and empty, purely performative #resist tactics.

U.S.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States) (i.e.: ""the president has stated a plausible rationale for not holding elections, and Congress agrees, so how can we, mere humble Supreme Court justices that we are, overrule *the President* [breathless gasp], about political questions and unitary executive authority?""), then... what do you suppose is the next step?  Even if 100% of Democratic congresspeople refuse to participate in Congress from that point forward (and good luck compelling Schumer out of his waking coma to do more than *write a sternly worded letter*), House quorum is a simple majority, which Republicans hold. They could just continue on as if nothing had changed, and maybe call the National Guard to hunt down and arrest Democratic politicians for impertinence / disloyalty / etc.  Does that behavior seem improbable or beyond the pale?

">I do. Totally failed the trolley problem.  The problem with the Trolley Problem is that it's not actually a problem. It's a false paradox implying you only have 2 choices. But people like you believe there are only 2 choices and are willing to sacrifice some to save many, when there is theoretically an option to sacrifice none. You can hit the fucking brakes. That takes actual work and critical thinking, though.  >They hate the status quo so much they are willing to sacrifice vulnerable communities  Not everyone has the time or capacity to think about every possible person. I guarantee even you, on your high and mighty throne, make decisions in your life that adversely affect others. After all, you own the technology to communicate on this platform.   >Total nonsense.  [Both dem and Rep leadership oppose banning stock trading for congressional members](https://www.bu.edu/rbfl/2023/05/17/insider-trading-by-members-of-congress/)  Another example, several years ago when I owned my own business, I leveraged that to get my foot in the door to a state congress dinner in WA state. When I finally got my chance to have just a state legislator's ear for 30 seconds and request something specific, her first response (without even comprehending what I was talking about - not that it was complicated) was, ""and how can you help us this year?""  >are just as happy to deny Americans their rights   Democrats have historically infringed upon the 2nd Amendment, which is a right, not a privilege. I'm not trying turn this into a gun debate except for saying that there is a process to ammend the constitution. If banning guns is something you're passionate about, more power to you, but you have elect people who will pursue that. In the meantime, democrats have just been making up laws with BS definitions of guns and related equipment to enact ineffective bans on law-abiding citizens' rights.   Democrats also had decades worth of time to codify roe v wade and never did it. They passed a milquetoast Healthcare law, got gay marriage legalized, and what else? All these things were broadly supported even by the largest religious sect in the country, hardly a big victory. They've never fought hard enough for workers rights (if you need more proof just ask yourself why some of the biggest unions backed Trump last year). They are soft on repeat criminals to the point where democratic-lead cities are some of the most violent in the country.  Edit:  Cities with the highest income disparity:  Miami, New Orleans, Atlanta, NYC, Houston, Boston, SF, Chicago.  All democrat led cities with extreme wealth gaps, some of the worst in the country. What exactly are democrats doing to remedy this? Their entrenched power doesn't seem to be helping.  Not saying you should elect a republican instead, but that you should really be scrutinizing your dem leadership and calling them on shit that isn't working. I know ""enlightened centrist"" is a meme on reddit, but maybe centrists really are more enlightened than entrenched democrats who keep voting for the same losers. Whoever is responsible for repeatedly electing the likes of Schumer and Pelosi surely can't be considered ""enlightened""",arequipapi,2025-05-03T21:50:47,-5
"Lot of assumptions there.  1. I've signed a petition to get RCV on the ballot in my state every year it has come up. It's never gotten enough to get on the ballot.  2. I've voted to primary my Democrat representative, who is nothing more than your standard-issue neo-con.   3. I've voted 3rd party in some local elections, including at the state legislator and city council levels. Where I live, most actual progressives run as independents at the local level, not Dem.  4. I've donated money to actual progressives  5. You missed my point entirely. As I said, I held my nose while voting Kamala but I still did it. But I understand why people have given up on the Democratic party. Sure, many democrats stand for things, but they don't even have any power within their own party as long as the likes of Schumer and Pelosi are pulling the strings. My whole point was that while I understand why some have given up, I haven't. I don't find it super unbelievable that many people simply don't care to keep supporting establishment democrats anymore.   6. Maine was actually #3 in voter turnout behind Minnesota and Colorado, and that's still cherry-picking 1 datum from a sample size of 2 because the only other state that uses RCV is Alaska which ranked #24 in voter turnout. I'm not a statistics expert but I know enough to know thise 2 data points mean nothing when it comes to predicting RCV's effect on voter turnout  7.

"> It's a false paradox  No it isn't. You can do something in the face of a looming disaster that isn't ideal or stand by and do nothing allowing the disaster to happen. I guess there were 3 choices: oppose fascism, do nothing, or be a fascist. Doing nothing is immoral and essentially is accessory to fascism. I don't expect someone that is morally bankrupt to be an ally of others but it is off putting to see someone so up front with how uncaring they are.  Conservatives are domestic terrorists that should be disarmed.  > democrats have just been making up laws with BS definitions of guns   That's not true, you are just making things up.  > They are soft on repeat criminals   Nah.

I'm a gun owner who has had my rights taken away by people who believe the AR in AR15 stands for assault rifle. I am not making anything up.
