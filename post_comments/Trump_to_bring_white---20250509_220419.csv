Should seize the farmland China owns in the US and give it to the Afrikaner farmers.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-09T22:14:30,229
The mental gymnastics will be fun from the left trying to argue that these refugees are bad and gang members refugees are good.,sub2pewdiepieONyt,2025-05-10T07:01:23,71
All of a sudden the left will hate refugees and want strict limits.,DarkFate602,2025-05-09T22:26:47,70
What is happening in South Africa is the end goal of DEI.,Mundane-Assist-7088,2025-05-09T22:30:10,63
Probably the first true use of the asylum process in quite a while.,shamalonight,2025-05-10T15:09:08,6
We have friends in SA who are not farmers and so far are away from the main areas that are affected by the ethnic cleansing. But their world is small and difficult. We would jump at the chance to help them emigrate.,Blasikov,2025-05-10T11:22:56,6
"You couldn't ask for a more model group of refugees. Industrious, culturally compatible, and actually being persecuted.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-10T00:11:57,22

The government seizing land and redistributing it maybe is not the best precedent. Remember Dems might win again one day too.,MMcDeer,2025-05-10T04:08:25,173
"The odds of any white Afrikaners being invited here as refugees, being farmers, are probably pretty damn slim.   Of the ~63 million South African citizens, [about 7.2% or 4.5 million are white](https://southafrica-info.com/people/south-africa-population/). Just for overall population context.   The total number of [farming households in SA is around 242,000](https://theconversation.com/land-reform-in-south-africa-5-myths-about-farming-debunked-195045).   Of these, only about 18% are white (same source). So about 43,000 households. Even if we assume a five person household (and assume they all farm), that’s still less than a quarter million out of a 4.5 million population.",MCRNRocinante,2025-05-10T09:43:15,18

"""No, not the white refugees!"" - Democrats probably.",Kern_system,2025-05-10T11:34:42,11
They’ll ignore the refuge portion. Hell they’ll ignore the entire underlying issue in SA that caused this and focus purely on the “white” part.,daspes1269,2025-05-10T11:53:27,-2
"They really are. I spent some time in Johannesburg for work and met one woman whose family was murdered on a farm, another guy on my security team used to take down poachers in Kruger National Park, other victims of violent crime… what surprised me the most is how all of them spoke about it so matter-of-factly and it was sad.  There’s so many wonderful people in South Africa who are terribly afflicted by crime. Black or white, Xhosa or Afrikaner, doesn’t matter. These are the refugees we want in America, not TdA gang members from Venezuela.",zip117,2025-05-10T01:09:12,69

I'm ok with instituting a 50% property tax on all foreign owned land.  Make it completely untenable to own the property.,WreknarTemper,2025-05-10T09:22:25,65

"If you only prioritized immigrants from countries where the average person wasn't racist, you would ironically end up with an immigration policy that looks like it was drafted by white nationalists.  The average Chinese, Indian, Guatemalan, Somalian, and Yemeni is just as racist if not -more- racist than the average Afrikaner.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-10T01:14:43,47
"I agree that they aren’t any less deserving than the Xhosa or Zulu people who are just as affected by crime in South Africa, but why are you calling Afrikaners losers? Let’s just stop with the racism altogether…",zip117,2025-05-10T01:15:58,19
WTF are you talking about? This isn't 30 years ago. Most Afrikaaners I ever met are not racist at all. Times have changed.,GeneticsGuy,2025-05-10T01:58:43,16

"So it's ok to go over to a foreign country and blow them up to take their land, but not ok to reject a foreign country's claims on our own land, ""Veteran""-flaired poster?  Just trying to get a sense of what right and wrong is.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-10T12:49:33,5
