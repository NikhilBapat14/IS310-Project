"All the conflicting information around this story at market open points to the usual manipulation. Trump says one thing, Amazon puts out a statement saying the other.    Is also possible Trump simply got confused to begin with on the whole topic. Because he's stupid, that happens a lot too.",AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-29T10:35:49,7
when telling the truth about you is 'hostile and political' you are not a person with popular support. No 'mandate' can be legitimate if information is suppressed.,Unsourced_hearsay,2025-04-29T10:38:24,6
"One just has to wonder what the WH logic is by saying that it is a ""hostile and political"" act if a company is transparent with what you are paying for.",GrumpyOldFart7676,2025-04-29T10:40:45,3

You could replace the dumb blond speaker with a podium and not tell the difference.     Well at least the podium would have a use and cost less.,Individual_Space4533,2025-04-29T11:14:05,1
"“This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” [Leavitt](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/karoline-leavitt) said. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?”  Because it would have shown how much they were price gouging regular people.",Unsourced_hearsay,2025-04-29T11:41:48,1

"I mean it is a pretty easy to follow sequence of events. Trump announced outrageous tariffs, import costs increase, companies raise prices to offset higher costs.   He can say what ever he wants, but where is the confusion in that?",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T10:43:36,5
"The way they are trying to spin this is amazing. Why is she holding his picture up like that, like he is some sort of fugitive to be on the look out for? Hahaha.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T10:42:00,2
You overestimate people's logic. Most would blame it on corporate greed or China or some other unrelated entity. This way it shows how Trump's policy directly affects the prices.,Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T10:40:38,6

"The most frustrating thing is she never actually answers a F'n question. She will spit out a talking point, or flat out lie, then take the next question without giving the person a chance to follow up or question her non answer.  To a simple minded audience, that might work, but anyone listening and paying attention would say..... wait, you didn't even give an answer.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T11:23:08,3
"I think enough people still believe his and his administrations words, unfortunately.   As for Trump, His confusion about the most basic things will always be a mystery to me",AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-29T10:46:43,3
"I think 10-15 percent increase and I would agree with you however products almost doubling in price almost overnight is giving people way more pause, heck in the board game world the tariffs are already hitting and corporate greed isn't being blamed.",FlyingRock,2025-04-29T11:11:10,1

"I have unfortunately had conversations with people that very wholeheartedly equate usa based suppliers as selling made in the usa products, as in they are not able to figure out how middlemen sales work; expect them to connect nothing. Don’t lower the bar, in fact discard the concept of a bar; they may find that confusing, freeze, run the other direction, and collapse something else in our society. Best practice is to avoid sudden movements around them",Fun-Rice-9438,2025-04-29T13:02:38,1
