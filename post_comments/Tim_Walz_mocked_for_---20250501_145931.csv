"I don't know what's worse, that they needed to find a specific guy who could talk like a human to regular people, or that he's the best they could find",woailyx,2025-05-01T15:30:08,224

"If you have to say that you can ""code talk"" to ""white guys"" instead of just ""talk to guys,"" you are very strange and unappealing to normal guys.   Democrats seem to think that if they just nominate a white guy, that automatically makes him appealing to men. But none of that matters if he still supports Democrat policies that men find repulsive.",majr02,2025-05-01T15:02:12,203

">he was the ‚Äúpermission structure‚Äù to win over white men from rural America to vote for Democrats.  Oooooh I remember that commercial:  ""I man enough to vote for a woman.""  Good grief the fuckin pandering.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-05-01T15:51:23,42
Apparently he cant,plitspidter,2025-05-01T15:09:39,44
imagine a republican saying they chose a  colored person running mate and saying theyre picked to code talk.,HeavensNight,2025-05-01T15:58:37,33
This is racist and sexist. Can't say I'm surprised tho,Empire2k5,2025-05-01T15:55:46,28
he code talked to me to vote trump instead of not voting.,Phenzo2198,2025-05-01T20:37:51,10
The party that despises white people so much they had to scramble and figure out how to get white people's votes! And they picked this guy? Hmm how did that work out? üòÇ,DogsLoveMeCatsHateMe,2025-05-01T17:33:01,15
"All they know is identity politics. It's their sole focus. Literally everything is seen through a racial lense. Absolutely insane.  Even when you don't vote for them they say it's because you're racist. If you're black and don't vote for them, they call you slurs. RACE IS EVERYTHING. These people are nuts.",Special_Sun_4420,2025-05-01T22:02:38,7
I‚Äôd be willing to bet 80% of Americans would be entirely grossed out by what is said in a private conversation between Harris and Walz. Their messaging is so contrived and bizarre that you can tell it was reverse engineered with a specific clandestine purpose. They are so pathetic.,MiceTonerAccount,2025-05-01T15:47:35,25
It's still mind boggling to me how they spent 1 1/2 billion dollars in such a short time.,bulldog522002,2025-05-01T17:21:10,11
"Remember that picking Walz was the first thing that Kamala decided herself on the campaign, signaling how genuinely incapable she was of making good decisions.",RandolphE6,2025-05-02T04:27:27,5
That‚Äôs where they lost half the country. Thinking they can ‚Äúcode switch‚Äù and hope we buy an inauthentic political platform with zero substance.   Gotcha‚Ä¶,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-01T17:10:13,8

Can someone please code talk to me so I can know WTF code talking is? I imagine it‚Äôs his impression of the George Carlin Modern Man bit.,sWo97,2025-05-01T15:46:17,8
There's no way he knows Morse code,Silverado153,2025-05-01T16:51:49,2
Even more ironically they tried to make Vance being weird a talking point,plitspidter,2025-05-01T19:14:28,53
They likely picked him because any serious contender in 2028 wanted zero association with the senile/hyena administration.,Based_Semen,2025-05-01T17:29:07,54
The worst thing we can do is assume democrats are stupid. Any heavy hitters are/were saved for 2028. They had the polling numbers; they knew this election was a wash.,ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-01T17:42:00,15
"Basically, haha.",skarface6,2025-05-01T21:40:33,6
That‚Äôs what they‚Äôve always done though is code switching  All the way back to Hillary and the hot sauce thing to Kamala and her changing accents,plitspidter,2025-05-01T15:10:33,53
"He even called it a ""permission structure."" What a fucking communist freak. Men don't ask for permission to vote for a guy because, oh my science, he's a -white man- in 2024! Let me check with my partner's boyfriend first.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-01T19:42:07,19

"I don't know, but it sure sounds like ""white men are so racist and sexist that they can't even communicate with women or minorities - that's where I (meaning Walz) come in.""",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-05-01T15:53:04,22

"Still makes you wonder if she didn‚Äôt listen to the Palestine crowd and chose Josh Shapiro, would they have actually had a chance at winning the Rust Belt states?   I think the election was heading for a loss either way with Biden‚Äôs cratering approval numbers, but that may have been able to save some face in the election had they not completely lost everything.   Doesn‚Äôt change that her and her team didn‚Äôt listen to anybody but themselves and thought they had it in the bag despite not even having an internal poll of them ever winning.",MT_2A7X1_DAVIS,2025-05-02T06:28:13,4

"Really enjoyed the post-election week hysteria amongst the liberals on the mainstream subs   ""Will someone, anyone, tell us why we lost? How could the voters do this??""""  ""Sure, here's why the Dems lost...""  *gets buried with hundreds of downvotes, with everyone disagreeing vehemently. Additionally, dozens of comments personally insulting the commenter and conservatives as a whole.*",Ripamon,2025-05-02T00:49:35,17
Rumor was Shapiro turned her down.,skarface6,2025-05-02T07:30:04,5
"They are not heavy hitters. They are unelectable in national elections. While the Democrats in a microcosm and in the media have shifted further and further off the left edge deep end, the front runners for elections have not been those people, because those people cannot win outside of liberal echo chambers.",North_Moment5811,2025-05-02T12:55:36,4
"Good. If those are their heavy hitters I‚Äôm not losing any sleep. Honestly, I think their only hope is a last minute out of nowhere guy like Obama. I think the new formula for the democrats will be to run a Biden-in-the-basement campaign.",IHearBedPeople,2025-05-02T16:18:52,1
"Might‚Äôve been a mix of both to be honest. Antisemitism disguised as ‚Äúanti-Zionism‚Äù has been in a sharp uptick among younger Democrats. It even led to figures like John Fetterman privately voicing their concerns to Kamala‚Äôs campaign for nominating a Jewish man for vice president, while part of that is because they have a bit of a standing rivalry.  I‚Äôd have to imagine at least part of it was that Shapiro didn‚Äôt want to put his family into the spotlight like that during the current conflict. Downside was that it killed Jewish support for Democrats in the cycle, some reports saying as low as 60% in swing districts compared to their usual 75% if not greater.",MT_2A7X1_DAVIS,2025-05-02T08:16:15,4
"If you want to underestimate them, go for it.
