"I used to think this shit was deployed to act as a deflection to keep eyes off the falling and smashed spinning plates elsewhere, however now I'm of the opinion their dumb statements simply used to exhaust the media space of any opposing views and dem attempted fight back news. Their mission..to own and command the news space and sustain a news diversity vacuum. News organisations need to get off this spoon-fed drivel and start reporting on the fightback.",bickering_fool,2025-05-07T11:35:14,4

Jeeze!  The few cartographers left on the US Gov't after the DOGE layoffs haven't even come close to finishing relabeling the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on all those maps and now he's throwing this at them?

I'm 100% sure he will claim Greenland is now Red White and Blueland. This will be the first time as far as I know any country leader has ever tried to rename a country.  This fucking guy just tried to rename a body of water that doesn't even border America at all.,Bircka,2025-05-08T03:07:13,1
"This grifting ghoul is collecting bribes from the sketchiest petro-states. The UAE alone dropped over $2 billion into his dimwitted nepo-baby sons’ crypto clown show. This guy’s net worth never reached the billon-dollar levels his whole career. But now? Suddenly he’s Scrooge McDuck diving into a vault of Qatari riyals and Emirati dirhams. He's enriching himself and milking this cow (being the POTUS and really US as a whole) to the last goddamn drop.   But hey, I hope all the racist snowflakes who voted for him are finally happy now. After eight long years of clutching their pearls over a Black guy existing in the White House, they’ve got their revenge: a senile old con artist selling off the country to oil sheikhs and hedge-fund scumbags. Congrats, folks! You ‘owned the libs’ so hard you let him own you. Can we move on now?",raddital,2025-05-08T13:25:55,1
