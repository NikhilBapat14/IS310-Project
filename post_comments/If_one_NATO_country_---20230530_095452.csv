"NATO is a defensive treaty. By attacking another country, any country, they violated that agreement and article 5 would be for the country that was attacked.",[deleted],2023-05-30T16:01:14,32
"From the NATO website (emphasis added):  >	Article 5 provides that if a NATO Ally is the **victim** of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally *attacked*.",[deleted],2023-05-31T05:57:15,8
"Technically, NATO can do whatever it wants. The treaty just builds in obiligations, and those obligations have to be invoked. They are not automatic.  By that I mean if NATO chooses to do nothing, then nothing will happen. NATO members could independently decide to join the war, but NATO is not required for that to happen.",Shakezula84,2023-06-03T16:45:27,3
Do you mean if Ukraine attacks Russia or if France attacks Spain? And really given that Russia attacked Ukraine first anything it dies now is just defense.,tuna_tofu,2023-06-04T09:43:09,1
"Theoretically no. NATO wouldn't want to encourage such behavior.   Realistically, NATO might not trigger article 5 but would move heaven and earth to support the wayward member.   Remember, NATO did support the US in its invasion of Afghanistan on very thin technicalities about the Taliban not turning over non-state actors who committed a terrorist attack against America. And NATO involved itself in Kosovo without an attack on a member, and de facto supported the war in Iraq with its bases and infrastructure.   So never expect to hold NATO to its own rules.",Kronzypantz,2023-06-20T19:59:33,1
"They will unite against the aggressor. The aggressor maybe in response to something tangible. However, has the requirement to try and resolve diplomatically. By acting aggressively with the threats of military engagement.. They incur the wrath of the NATO forces. The closest has been Turkey and Greece is what I read. However, the situation deescalated prior to the the implementation of Article 5.",IndependentNo4370,2023-06-26T02:57:28,1
"Huh?  The way you wrote that, you’re saying A5 would apply to a non-NATO country.  I don’t see that.  Short answer to the question is A5 would not apply.  It is a defensive treaty for a NATO country.  If a NATO country attacks ANOTHER NATO country, then A5 kicks in.  But that really wasn’t the question.  The question was if a NATO attacks another country not in NATO, does A5 kick in on the COUNTER attack.  I have not seen a definitive answer to that, but I would think it’s a “yes” based on the wording.  Edit: did a little more research and the answer is no.  A5 is PURELY a defensive measure and would not support an act of offensive aggression by ANY country - including NATO countries.",Boilerbuzz,2023-06-01T06:42:10,4
Thank you for clarifying all the above comments. Your comment was really understandable and I appreciate that!,Davismozart957,2023-06-01T22:14:03,3
"There is still a vagueness there that suggests if the NATO ally is losing and enemy forces encroach on their territory, NATO would respond.",Kronzypantz,2023-06-20T20:00:56,2
"That is rubbish, Iraq, FYR Yugoslavia and a few other countries didn't attacked USA or any NATO country yet they still banded together and attacked another non NATO country. To me, NATO is just a band of powerful economical countries that want to keep in check other countries, as you may have noticed, it is really starting to look like WW2 with 2 big spheres opposing each other.",zaplayer20,2023-06-23T00:40:50,1
"That is true.  There is also a deal of ambiguity over what would happen when/if Ukraine joined.   Crimea is still internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory, but it is occupied illegally by Russia.   Would that oblige NATO to join on the side of Ukraine?  Maybe it’s been discussed and agreed upon previously, but it really seems like they’re saying, “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”",[deleted],2023-06-21T10:16:03,1
The discussion wasn’t about what NATO is to *you*. It was  a question about Article 5.  Nothing more.,Boilerbuzz,2023-06-23T05:48:56,1
