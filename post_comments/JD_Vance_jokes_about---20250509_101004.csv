"I know it's not likely to happen, but what I want to see is a massive international turnout for the matches held in Canada and Mexico and an effective boycott of the US hosted matches.",Optimism_Deficit,2025-05-09T10:14:43,41

The US finally gets a shot to host of the largest worldwide events and this guy can’t wait to screw it up. The countries that don’t love the US are not going to get the joke.,Dio44,2025-05-09T12:00:30,4

"I've commented on another post about this but as someone that has been to 2 world cups it's possibly the dumbest way to plan to overstay your visa. Not only does it not really make sense, but someone that is fleeing their country likely wouldn't even have the ability or means to do so   You have to show proof of tickets, proof of lodging, and proof of travel within the country to even get a visa in the first place.   Literally makes no sense to go this route for this purpose",ATLfalcons27,2025-05-09T10:30:43,1
