For many elderly shut-ins Meals on Wheels is the only social contact they have with the outside world. It's also very important that someone is assuring the elderly get adequate nutrition. Cutting the program is as inhumane as it is on brand for MAGA GOP.,SpectacularRedditor,2025-04-24T18:11:00,30
i wonder if american farmers are connecting the dots concerning the source of the food for both this and the USAID programs?  kinda sorta doubt it.,entrepenurious,2025-04-24T18:22:50,20

"Heinous. I did deliveries for MOW after seeing how much it helped my mother/ergo our fam — not exactly haute cuisine, but the fact it also = a check-in, showing someone cares, is invaluable.",Straight-Treacle-630,2025-04-24T18:16:22,13

"I've heard some farmers who made the connection between their livelihoods and ending the USAID program, but didn't regret their Trump votes. They just need the government to give them some subsidies.  They have *not* figured out that subsidies and welfare are *the same damn thing*.",Professional-Can1385,2025-04-24T21:10:25,4

"My dad did it. Having someone check in is important. One guy on his route didn't pick up his food from the day before and didn't answer the door. My dad escalated the situation. Turns out the guy had died. But he could have fallen and just needed medical attention.  My dad really enjoyed it because he got to talk to different folks. Just a little chit chat, which is all he really likes, but he likes it.",Professional-Can1385,2025-04-24T21:15:28,4

">""…Let the farmer, so far as I am concerned, be damned forevermore.  To Hell with him, and bad luck to him.  He is a tedious fraud and ignoramus, a cheap rogue and hypocrite, the eternal Jack of the human pack.  He deserves all that he ever suffers under our economic system, and more.  Any city man, not insane, who sheds tears for him is shedding tears of the crocodile.  >No more grasping, selfish and dishonest mammal, indeed, is known to students of the Anthropoidea.  When the going is good for him he robs the rest of us up to the extreme limit of our endurance; when the going is bad be comes bawling for help out of the public till.  Has anyone ever heard of a farmer making any sacrifice of his own interests, however slight, to the common good? Has anyone ever heard of a farmer practising or advocating any political idea that was not absolutely self-seeking — that was not, in fact, deliberately designed to loot the rest of us to his gain? Greenbackism, free silver, the government guarantee of prices, bonuses, all the complex fiscal imbecilities of the cow State John Baptists — these are the contributions of the virtuous husbandmen to American political theory.  There has never been a time, in good seasons or bad, when his hands were not itching for more; there has never been a time when he was not ready to support any charlatan, however grotesque, who promised to get it for him.  Only one issue ever fetches him, and that is the issue of his own profit.  He must be promised something definite and valuable, to be paid to him alone, or he is off after some other mountebank.  He simply cannot imagine himself as a citizen of a commonwealth, in duty bound to give as well as take; he can imagine himself only as getting all and giving nothing.  \- [H.L.
