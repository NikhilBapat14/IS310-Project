"Meanwhile planes are dropping from the sky or getting lost by the towers, air controllers being laid off or quitting because of doge. I broke it and I can fix it is what he should be saying but you know he can’t admit a mistake.",individualine,2025-05-08T09:17:25,6

"This implies that the current system is flawed. If true why?  Systems like this require years of planning to redesign. You don’t just decide to overhaul a system that is functioning well. At best you layer on controls and slowly upgrade over time. The process isn’t one that can or should be done quickly. You can’t move fast and break things with systems that keep people alive. If they do this then I’m guessing we’ll have more problems not less. You can’t anti-woke, non DEI, own the libs, Alpha you’re way to a new traffic control system. You have to have qualified people doing the work.",hmr0987,2025-05-08T09:53:40,6
"President Donald Trump’s administration is preparing to spend billions in the latest bid to fix America’s outdated and understaffed air traffic control system, but his team will have to launch the plan under a Federal Aviation Administration with its leadership decimated by Trump’s own policies and its remaining staff demoralized.  A [crisis at Newark Airport](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/05/05/newark-airport-flight-delays-air-traffic-control/) that unfolded over the last week — including a communications outage between a control facility and incoming planes that caused air traffic controllers to take trauma leave from their jobs — was just the latest example of dangers that have been the subject of warnings for decades.  On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy is expected to unveil the latest plan to replace old communications and tracking equipment with a modern system. But Duffy will be attempting to build the new system without key career FAA leaders, who are departing en masse in personnel cuts engineered by Elon Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service.
