Wouldn’t be the first time such a gift had a listening device in it,treskel12,2025-04-27T02:31:45,59
Isn't it bizarre to have an enemy nation that is planning to take over the world send a gift of a flatteringly fake portrait to our Dear Leader?   This is like a grade B dystopian novel.,SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T03:32:58,24

"A Secret Service agent banged his gun into the President's ear trying to protect him. The assailant's bullets did not put the President's life in immediate danger, but much like January 6th another 'fan' did pay the price with their life.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-27T02:47:18,4

Of course he had to trim six inches off Bluto’s waist. Sad.,blue_quark,2025-04-27T08:41:38,2
A painting of Trump burning the constitution would be a more accurate portrayal of his presidency.,ineverywaypossible,2025-04-27T14:28:20,2

'The Thing'. What are the chances this gift is more than it seems to be?,HorrorStudio8618,2025-04-27T05:49:47,1
The frame includes a little speaker that plays sound bites from speeches while the portrait’s mouth moves like Billy Bass.,latouchefinale,2025-04-27T09:07:17,1
I was hoping it would be something like Rainbow Putin.       [https://www.studioberg.nl/putin-a-rainbow/vj2sxcp3ly9zk7e1ztfofcgq3mzzg1](https://www.studioberg.nl/putin-a-rainbow/vj2sxcp3ly9zk7e1ztfofcgq3mzzg1),mightiestmovie,2025-04-27T09:38:02,1

"Pretending I knew nothing about Trump, just that he was a US president at some point:  That would have been a pretty damn good painting had the artist resisted the blatant Russian inspired nationalism.  https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24195803307155.jpg  Keep the agents, give 'em a depression era style like Miner Joe and done.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T02:43:34,0
In this case my question would be: is such a device actually necessary?,Ranidaphobiae,2025-04-27T03:32:02,32
Cartoon style.  A huge reel to reel with an 80s microphone scotch taped to the back.,RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-04-27T05:11:52,11

There already is a listening device. It's the direct hotline between The White House and the Kremlin.,biscuitarse,2025-04-27T08:51:05,0
"No no, you see you're wrong about that, because Russia is no longer an enemy. Trump loves Russia, Trump wants to be a vassal state for Russia.",areyoualocal,2025-04-27T05:01:08,5
">~Proverbs 29:5 - ""A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.""  It's a trap that Trump simply can't resist stepping into.",Vapur9,2025-04-27T06:25:01,4
"I don’t know how flattering it is. Look at trumps face, particularly the right side of his face. (His right btw). Looks like he’s having a full on stroke. Just look at his mouth.",Reorox,2025-04-27T11:52:31,1

The Donald Trump Memorial Balcony has a nice ring to it.,Area51_Spurs,2025-04-27T02:46:13,19
Flattery. Trump's such a sucker for it. It's a major weak spot. And Putin has exploited it to devastating effect.,inthekeyofc,2025-04-27T04:41:55,1

"They would need to do it in shifts. Having one person do it, that person would just happily exit out the ""oppsydaisy"" window.",Votcha,2025-04-27T05:09:23,3
Look at the body they painted for him!  This reminds me of the flattering Kim Jong Un stories about how he made a hole in one in golf when he was just 5 years old. Or when the heads of the government agencies all stood up one by one in front of the press to tell stories of how amazing our Dear Leader trump is. So cringe.,SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T13:34:13,1
"Putin absolutely has dreams of bringing Russia back to historic world domination from the time of the Great Czars. That's why he's pushing so hard to kill NATO, and that's been his plan for a Puppet Trump from the beginning.   I'm not saying China and the US aren't also doing so,  but to claim Russia isn't on the path is ridiculous.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T03:52:28,6

The inverted flag is just how it appeared in the picture of Trump’s reaction in the aftermath - it’s not an insult: https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24195803307155.jpg,Fluffy_Marionberry54,2025-04-27T04:55:35,2

The person you are replying to either has a depressingly poor grasp of reality or serious mental health issues (whether they are trolling or emotionally charged).,Remarkable_Education,2025-04-27T04:07:32,7
"Thanks. I won't continue the conversation.   FYI, there are some overzealous mods on this sub. If you call someone out, question whether they are trolling,  you may get a temp ban. I got banned for a WEEK because I questioned whether someone who gave a bizarre response was a bot. It's apparently against the rules.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T04:29:15,3
"Try filing an appeal. I just got temporarily banned yesterday and had no access to the comment that caused it. I filed an appeal requesting to see the post as I didn’t remember it but was sure it wasn’t threatening anything… so I got reinstated and they apologized. The ban is done by automation, the appeal is reviewed by people.",bofh000,2025-04-27T04:55:24,3
"Yup. I tried. I didn't know that  questioning if someone was a bot is against the rules. So when my comment was deleted, it just said I broke rules. I've had that happen before and it was usually an automated bot or someone flagging the comment to get you in trouble. I would click on the link and get a reprieve.   One time the mod did not understand I was actually pro immigrant - I come from an immigrant family - he didn't grasp the comparison I was making and accused me of hate, sigh. This upset me so much that I tried to explain to him what I said was pro immigrant - but he threatened me with a permanent ban if I replied back, so I had to shut up.   This last time it was because I asked about the comment being deleted. There's a button to click , so I clicked and asked why and was told it was an automated delete , and I was going to be banned for the week.  ( If I hadn't clicked - I probably wouldn't have been banned! )   So I apologized and said I didn't know it was in the rules. They didn't care. Calling people bots or accusing them of being paid actors , etc. gets a ban.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T08:57:21,2
