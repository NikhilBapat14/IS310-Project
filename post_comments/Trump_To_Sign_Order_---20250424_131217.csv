"The president‚Äôs order directs the Justice Department to crack down on illegal ‚Äústraw donor‚Äù and foreign contributions in United States elections, the document said, and instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate allegations regarding online fundraising platforms that make ‚Äústraw‚Äù or ‚Äúdummy‚Äù contributions or foreign contributions to political candidates or committees.

As well as the official CA wildfires charity site. It's a blatant money laundering scheme and the left are freaking out. The corruption is now out in the open and no one is paying any attention... it's beyond sickening.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-04-24T21:35:50,13
