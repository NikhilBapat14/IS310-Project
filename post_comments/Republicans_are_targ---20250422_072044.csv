"Man, you guys need to change up that electoral college bullshit you use to elect your presidents.   Sane Americans (74,999,166 of you) and the rest of the planet shouldn't have their fortunes dictated by a group of ignorant hillbillies who value the pain of others over the interests of themselves and their families.",biscuitarse,2025-04-22T08:51:18,7

"Our newsroom has been following health policy under the Trump Administration and put together this primer on what we can expect with Medicaid and Medicaid under Dr. Oz, who is now leading the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).      CMS provides health insurance for 160 million Americans who get coverage through Medicare, Medicaid and the Obamacare exchanges, and its [$1.5 trillion budget is nearly double](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-financial-report-fiscal-year-2024.pdf) that of the Department of Defense.   To get an inside look at the impact Oz could have on these programs as one of the country’s top health care officials, we talked with two people: Tara Bannow, a STAT News reporter who [profiled Oz](https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/dr-oz-trump-nominee-journey-from-medicine-to-daytime-tv-to-cms-administrator/), and Tom Scully, who ran CMS under President George W. Bush.   Here are a few key things we learned in those conversations:  * **Oz has a history of touting medical treatments that** [**lack scientific evidence**](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html) **and of not being transparent about his** [**financial stake**](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5201663/trump-dr-oz-investments-cms) **in the products he promotes.** He’s also been a long-time supporter of [private Medicare Advantage plans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2020/06/11/medicare-advantage-for-all-can-save-our-health-care-system/), though in the Senate hearing he seemed open to [more aggressive oversight](https://rollcall.com/2025/03/14/cms-pick-oz-vows-to-go-after-medicare-advantage/) of those plans. * As Oz has become more involved in Republican politics, he’s become less supportive of abortion and vaccines. **“He’s a politician,” said reporter Tara Bannow. “I think he will bend to the political wills of the moment.”** Don’t look to Oz to push back, for example, if the administration wants cuts to Medicaid, Bannow said. **On the other hand, Scully believes Oz’s warm relationship with Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could give him a strong opportunity to influence administration policy.**      Read more: [https://tradeoffs.org/2025/03/20/medicare-medicaid-under-dr-oz-what-to-expect/](https://tradeoffs.org/2025/03/20/medicare-medicaid-under-dr-oz-what-to-expect/)",TradeoffsNews,2025-04-22T13:25:53,1
