...and foxconn is going to build a plant in the US.  believe it when you see it folks.  Can't trust a single word out of this administration.  But what you CAN trust is that pretty much ANY bill going to congress for Vets is likely going to get voted down by Republicans.  Historically that's what they do.,SFM_Hobb3s,2025-05-10T15:13:55,1
The last time he said he was building something his advisor got convicted of fraud in a fundraising scheme related to said project.  Maybe this time there won't be any convictions because he will preemptively pardon them all.,thieh,2025-05-10T15:17:49,1

"You go fox.  Eventually your crab in a bucket scarcity mindset will look like shit to your grandkids when they realize it is to reinforce hierarchy at their expense.  You will be remembered as a significant machine of propaganda for the already wealthy at the expense of your poor* bigoted viewers.  A real study.  *poor in the sense of critical thinking skills, not poor in terms of assets.  Varies widely on that front.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-10T15:21:46,1

This article states that the population of homeless veterans has decreased.  It also mentions the current master plan that was developed during the Biden administration and that they are also partnering with residential real estate landlords to house some of the veterans.  I read something last year about them wanting to kick UCLA off the property and at least one other tenant.  They have already built permanent structures and other are in the process of being constructed.  They are also improving the medical facilities: [https://www.va.gov/greater-los-angeles-health-care/programs/va-west-los-angeles-campus-master-plan/](https://www.va.gov/greater-los-angeles-health-care/programs/va-west-los-angeles-campus-master-plan/),Feistyhummingbird,2025-05-10T16:40:14,1
