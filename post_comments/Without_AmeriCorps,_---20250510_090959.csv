"Rural people are going to learn the hard way that people live in cities because of economies of scale, and if you don't have scale then things like ""doctors"", delivery, internet, infrastructure in general - becomes pretty fuckin expensive.   They're literally voting away the subsidies that makes rural modern life possible.",gentlemantroglodyte,2025-05-10T09:34:14,52
"I can’t really feel bad for them though, this is what they voted for. And it doesn’t really seem like they will ever learn their lesson unfortunately.",Christian_C7,2025-05-10T10:03:21,18
Let’s not forget that this is what Republicans want for America and are currently actively supporting.,yorapissa,2025-05-10T09:53:58,6
"I’m an AmericCorps alumni. Without AmeriCorps, cities of all sizes will lose essential social services. The difference is that in many rural communities, AmeriCorps are one of the very few social services readily accessible so these areas will be hurt more than larger cities which have more social services available on a per capita basis.",Foucaultshadow1,2025-05-10T11:17:54,1
I’m so sorry you’re losing services after voting for people to lose services!,k8plays,2025-05-10T13:24:39,1
Good.   Fuck these welfare queens.   We've supported these ignorant greedy assholes long enough.,Constant_Crazy_506,2025-05-10T13:20:33,1
The Nazi party wants us less educated and homes less. That is how they fill work camps and keep the people subservient.,h8hannah8h,2025-05-10T13:28:03,1
"Have you been to rural America recently? It's a 3rd world country. No services, no jobs, junkies/homeless everywhere, no doctors, roads are basically unpaved, hideous 5G/4G reception, mom and pop downtowns are gutted, dollar stores and super-Walmarts everywhere.   Only shining beacon are the high schools providing sports and activities and those are all under attack.",hobopopa,2025-05-10T14:17:25,1
"At this point: good. Screw 'em.   Not just since the election, I have been increasingly leaning this way the last few years as I visit hideously poor places that are quite proud of how poor they are because they don't pay many taxes. They are proud that their roads are washed out and that the county has no money to keep things clear so they have to keep a chainsaw in the truck to get home, etc.   It's crazy.",shoobe01,2025-05-10T14:01:31,1

And it was already pretty bad. I have rural family and their access to healthcare and services has been shit for decades. They only went to the local hospital for minor injuries or if they planned to die. Everything else required a trip to the city.,Sharticus123,2025-05-10T10:58:58,1
"The hospital in my rural hometown is in danger of losing funding because they lost a state subsidy that says no other hospital can be built within 15 miles. Like, a whole hospital might go bankrupt because of a new hospital in the next town over.",Illustrious-Data1008,2025-05-10T14:12:09,1
"Yes, because everyone knows cities are so much more affordable than outside of the city. Rent, grocery and restaurant prices, parking, etc…  And we all know doctors reduce their prices in the cities due to economies of scale.   Literally the only economy of scale is government-distributed benefits since people are more concentrated. But that’s of course how people like you think. If we just gave the government more money to hand out, problems would be solved. How did that work with the homeless in San Fran? $1 Billion per year spent and problem has gotten worse. Maybe if we make it $2 Billion we’ll solve the problem?",AbortionIsSocialism,2025-05-10T10:02:35,-28
Exactly.   I have zero sympathy for the rural folks who are getting what they voted for.,yloduck1,2025-05-10T12:21:03,1
"I was demobilized this year, sad to see the program get the cut, hoping it’ll come back soon!",bitching_bot,2025-05-10T15:11:22,1
"Having lived in both I can say you are either missing the point or intentionally ignoring it. It’s hard to get internet and deliveries in rural areas because of this exact issue. Hospitals, etc need support to exist in those areas. Public services have to provide, private can say no. So cutting support disproportionally hurts rural areas.",77Robbs,2025-05-10T10:39:34,1
"You're bitching about price when the issue is access.  Urban areas will have more providers and more access.  Rural areas don't.  And youre circkejerking about government distributed benefits when government distributed benefits are sometimes all rural areas have, and now theyre losing them.",InertiasCreep,2025-05-10T11:43:34,1
You’ve missed the entire point of the comment.,Foucaultshadow1,2025-05-10T11:15:59,1
">Literally the only economy of scale is government-distributed benefits since people are more concentrated.   I love how you said this and still immediately missed the point completely.    It's not about affordability. It's about economic viability. If you were going to open a brand new business, where would you do it? Some town in Nebraska that's a six hour drive from the nearest major metropolitan area with a population of 2000 people... Or a city with 200000 people?   Government incentives are the only thing making the former appealing to anyone— or even economically viable. Without them, no one is going to take that big economic risk, and people who live in rural areas are going to be screwed.",Prince-Lee,2025-05-10T12:08:39,1
"Through your hate you are blind. Rural areas literally don’t have the economic opportunities for citizens in comparison to cities. Jobs, roads, housing, groceries, gas, car maintenance and health services are lesser quality and often more expensive than living in a city for these things. And that’s even if these services are near you in rural areas. It might be 30 minutes to the nearest grocery store, or 15 to one that has very little selection and high prices due to a small number of traffic through the store.",Nervous_Tax3843,2025-05-10T12:59:21,1
