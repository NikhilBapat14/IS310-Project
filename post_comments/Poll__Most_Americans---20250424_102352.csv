"Everyone understands that prices are going to go up, yet only 2% of Trump voters said that they would change their votes if they could.  This was never about the price eggs.  This was always about punching down.  Trump voters cast their ballots for Trump to bash the people on the margins they see as beneath them. Why?  Because one way to feel your status rise is to see other people's status fall.  And it can't fall any further than getting abducted off the street and shipped off to a foreign gulag.  So MAGA bigots and sadists are happy with their guy and couldn't possibly care less what happens to prices as long as marginal groups are getting their teeth kicked in.  But of course you can not say out loud that you get sadistic gratification from watching the weakest members of society get abused, even to yourself.  So, they pretended they care about eggs...",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-24T10:36:49,12

"Makes sense from a business point of view. If you had no way to predict the Trump yo-yo back and forth of changing things,.. then raising prices proactively is the only smart choice to hedge your bets ungainly unpredictability.",jmnugent,2025-04-24T10:35:11,2
"So if there's another presidential election, the gop will   lose. If it's common knowledge and belief that they are responsible for much higher prices, we'll just have some shitty centrist democrat come along and say they'll lower prices, and that'll be that.",VaIeth,2025-04-24T10:43:21,2

"Poll: Most Americans would be a better President, more at 11  Hell, pick any one of the 77,000,000 Republicans that voted for Trump and they would do a better job. They didn't have classified docs in the shitter with a copy machine at a resort in Florida and they don't owe Putin a god damn thing. Trump is also an employee of Mar A Lago just FYI.",tech57,2025-04-24T10:57:43,2

"You won't.  They weren't voting based on the ""economy"" in the first place.  These are people that couldn't spell ""GDP"" much less understand it.  It was always vague reason to justify their vote so they didn't have to admit the real reasons.  You know like hurting brown people, keeping gay people from getting married and stopping 4 transgender girls from playing sports.",Fortinbrassy,2025-04-24T10:57:37,1
