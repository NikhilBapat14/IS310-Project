"I can speak to the housing piece since I’m a real estate analyst professionally. They’re objectively correct on housing, which has been crippled by horrible land use regulation.  No real debate there among anyone who knows anything about it.  The question of how we manage the politics is trickier.  Local NIMBYs are extremely powerful in city politics, so you need some kind of state level changes to make “build a tall apartment building next to the train stop” a normal thing and not treat it like a war crime or hazing ritual.  I don’t know if it’s “neoliberal” to build apartments or condos or townhomes or etc., but who cares?? We need more housing units, it’s not a philosophical question.",Books_and_Cleverness,2025-03-17T13:28:57,53
"It is neoliberalism, but I think that it's wrong to call it a ""Trojan horse"". Because the issues that the abundance movement describes are very real. Housing is super expensive because of local input that means your local gas station can be a historical landmark. This means the supply of housing is limited at a time where population is growing and fewer people are getting married. The only way housing gets less expensive is to change either of those things, and forcing people to get married seems wrong.  It's also good politics. One of the biggest proponents of the abundance agenda is Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado. If you go to the NYT swing map from the 2024 election, you will see a bunch of red arrows that all are approxomately the same size. Except in Colorado, where there's a bunch of blue arrows. In an election where the entire country turned its back on the Biden administration, it seems like we should at least investigate why Colorado didn't",qchisq,2025-03-17T04:37:37,110

"Not only is it a good idea, it's absolutely necessary for blue states to adapt an abundance policy angle.  When you compare their metrics, most blue states absolutely trounce red states in education, life expectancy, income, and development. However, more people are moving to red states than blue states? Why is that?  Red states build. Not efficiently mind you, but they build. Housing is easier to come by in most red states, meanwhile you're lucky to find an affordable apartment in cities like SF and NYC. This causes people to vote with their wallets and move to red states where housing is cheaper. Which translates to blue states losing house seats census after census. To put it in plain language, blue states are ceding electoral clout to red states.  For blue states to bring the cost of housing down, they need to build more. It's simple econ. None of this rent control or affordable unit mandates, all those do is subsidize demand and make it both harder to build housing in the first place, and for prospective renters. It's basically like a 21st century version of the French revolutionaries putting price controls and quotas on bread, which just led to more scarcity.",[deleted],2025-03-17T15:33:21,15

"This is a false choice.  We can encourage development and streamline processes while still protecting the environment and promoting equity.    A huge amount of current policy is very inequitable. Just look even a little bit into transportation for example. It may seem like a weedy, technocratic subject, but the fact that the feds pay for 80% of interstate work but less than half of transit projects has huge implications for who has access to work, housing, school, parks, quality food, etc.   We can do a lot better.",-dag-,2025-03-17T20:46:40,6
"I think it is a bold vision and definitely a net positive. The US has always been known post-World War II as the world's technological powerhouse and it's best that this continues, for both themselves and the world. It drives progress, and there's little worthwhile rebuttal to this.  Of course, one may argue about the negative environmental effects, but I don't think that's really significant. A lot of companies, such as Meta and Amazon, are already moving toward nuclear energy and I think, especially with the rise of SMRs, that this will take hold. They have all the benefits of fossil fuels (unlike traditional renewables) and NO carbon emissions.   That was a bit of a rant but my point is that if you clear up regulations and encourage un-ideological innovation, it's a net positive, with no real downsides.",the_magus73,2025-03-17T00:24:50,21

"I’m onboard with the abundance agenda and frankly when the critics are “social justice” and “environmentalists” I’m even more persuaded it’s the right path.  Those elements on the left have hamstrung left leaning policies so badly they need to be reined in.  From its first week in office, the Biden administration had described “environmental justice” as one its top priorities.    Activists pushed for initiatives like the “Justice40 Initiative,” which mandated that 40% of benefits from climate-related programs go to disadvantaged communities.  The amount of spending that was subject to Biden’s 40% rule was enormous: For example, roughly half of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill was earmarked for projects that are arguably environment- or climate-related.  So you took that bill and tied it down with economic justice initiatives that slowed its roll out.  As a result, when running for reelection a ton of the money was still unspent and people had limited projects to show for it - and the jokes about EV chargers wrote themselves.

"The idea of it being a neo neoliberal trojan horse is one that has crossed my mind more than once, but I think after decades of ignoring the working class, witnessing the decline of the middle class, and recognizing the instability that such an aggregation of wealth in the hands of a narrow elite has caused worldwide, I'm starting to believe that maybe just maybe the people may get universal healthcare in this country finally.

"I'll agree that although Democrats are better on the environment than Republicans, they also aren't taking climate change nearly as seriously as they want to portray. EVs are better than gas cars, but the idea that we can just switch out gas for electric cars isn't really sustainable either. Creating walkable/bikeable cities with serious public transportation is a much better model. But that requires mass buy-in from the public which no one has figured out how to do yet. Ultimately, it's our scientific illiteracy that is our undoing.

Americans’ electrical needs are powered by sustainable energy “so clean it barely leaves a carbon trace and so cheap you can scarcely find it on your monthly bill”. AI breakthroughs, labor rights and economic reforms mean that most people can do their jobs in a shorter workweek. Vertical farms provide cheap and fresh vegetables, desalinated water from the ocean is used as drinking water, and lab-grown meat has replaced animal slaughter.  Cool!

"I am excited to read Kleins' book. I pre-ordered it after reading his NYT column marketing it, and it should be arriving tomorrow.   Progressive groups hate it because they fear it will end their ability to abuse bureaucratic process to control developments that they don't like. It could actually result in better opportunities for Americans, and they can't have that because they need Americans to be perpetually pissed off so that they can force through radical policies.   It is telling that progressives are so adamant in their preference to make government bigger, but insist on it being also handicapped when any policy or position is on they see as a sacred cow comes up. They seem to feel the government is supreme when it's advancing their own policies, but believe they should be able to block and obstruct everything it does unless their interests are the primary beneficiaries of that program. It's so fucking hypocritical and has continually degraded my belief that the rest of the Democratic party gains anything from our coalition with them.   The blending of neoliberalism and progressive moralising in the post Obama Democratic party has failed. It's time to move on.

"Housing follows supply and demand. Over the past several decades we've seen a growing economy, growing population and continued rural to urban migratory patterns. At the same time through zoning and a variety of other regulations we've effectively made it so that building significant amounts of new housing is impossible. The result is simple. We have more people with more money bidding on  essentially the same number of homes resulting in high prices. Lower income Americans are being crushed and unable to pay off debts/save for retirement.  The cost of living crisis has been decades in the making and it's not going to be quick to get out of it but it is possible to get out of it by building a lot more housing particularly dense housing in cities. It almost doesn't matter what kind of housing is added as long as it's being added in bulk. It's easiest to fix this at the local level but many cities simply won't do so and states should set housing targets and then if/when cities don't hit them they should strip them of their ability to block housing.",socialistrob,2025-03-17T15:48:54,1

"First off that book is written by hacks - scarcity isn’t caused by fucking regulations and “cultural shift”, that’s so dumb.  Scarcity is very much manufactured to protect and raise the value of commodities. It’s manufactured by those that own capital - for instance, we don’t have a housing shortage, we could house people. We CHOOSE not to. we CHOOSE to deny housing to others, we CHOOSE to create an environment of housing scarcity   Same with food! We grow an abundance of food in this country, we subsidize farms and agriculture industries heavily, and yet everyday we throw away dumpsters full of food everyday, we burn crops. Why? To maintain scarcity, to protect the commodification of food, to protect it’s value.  And by “we” i mean those who own the capital, not “we” the workers - it’s those that own and control the land and production of goods who control our environment of scarcity. They maintain the conditions that keep workers desperate to find work.

">streamlining regulations  There's your answer.  It's Neoliberal at heart, with overtures to progressivism's desire for \[necessary\] large scale development projects.  Hell, even the term ""development"" stems from a Neoliberal desire to encourage the private sector.  A more obviously neoliberal way to ""Streamline Regulations"" in communications is to ""Deregulate the economy"" or ""Expand Access.""  The issue with this approach is that most Americans have seen this kind of messaging before and are not fooled by it.  The moment you talk about streamlining regulations and other kinds of buzzwords and phrases like ""Stakeholders"" and ""Welfare"", you are wading into Neoliberalism.  Progressivism instead welcomes regulation as a necessary force in the free market, to keep market actors honest and reduce exploitation.  An organization that embodies this to me is OSHA.  It is an agency wing of the Department of Labor, and is arguably the biggest factor in establishing safer workplace regulations; particularly in blue collar workforces.  Recently, members of the GOP have suggested the idea of eliminating OSHA from the government (Probably with the intention of spinning it into a private enterprise).  This would be problematic, as OSHA would no longer be working on behalf of the government, i.e. working on behalf of the American people.  Instead, OSHA would be functioning as a private enterprise seeking profits.  That would be a recipe for company kickbacks, rolling back of workplace regulations, and an overall increase in workplace injuries across the board.",wrestlingchampo,2025-03-17T12:16:53,-1

"I can’t imagine anybody in the abundance agenda would be opposed to overturning Citizens United but that is not their focus. That requires getting a majority in the Supreme Court. That could take decades, and the abundance agenda has shit to do today.  The regulations we focus are what would be called regulatory capture. In housing the most important are restrictions designed to limit population density and promote suburban, car centric sprawl. We aren’t stupid we know this will be hard - the Boomers literally cemented their policies in our communities by building these enormous sprawling vehicle networks.  Policies that abundance supports include things like spending more on public transit and public housing. The regulations we want to slash include things like minimum parking requirements, minimum lot sizes, and height limits or laws that forbid shared walls. They don’t want to let homebuilders cut corners, they just want to let builders build what the moment demands, and to build the kinds of housing that are currently illegal for no good reason.  The politics are tricky. Land use is regulated by localities, and these local elections are often determined by very small groups of locals who pay attention. They are always whiter, wealthier, and older than the general population, and they show up at City Council meetings opposing development because dammit they grew up here and that historic gas station and its historic leaky pump must be preserved or god dammit how will anybody be able to recognize home anymore if the leaky gas station gets replaced with a few townhomes!!!   Thus the need for state laws to make certain local laws illegal. Of course, NIMBYs (not in my backyard!) have a deep bag of tricks to prevent development. In California anybody can file a CEQA lawsuit for a few hundred bucks. This can require a project to get a full environmental review, and will subject it to multiple public meetings in addition to any meetings and environmental reviews that the builder may have already competed. When California passed laws requiring localities to reform zoning, many cities complied and then began charging massive development fees to prevent homebuilders from being able to turn a profit, getting those projects cancelled. California passed a new law last year that will hopefully reign in those development fees, and now many NINBYs, Republicans leading the way, support rent controls as a way to ensure that new developments are not profitable. My local city councilor, a Republican said this (I’m paraphrasing), “I don’t support Rent Control, it’s bad economics, but if the state keeps meddling in our local affairs a strong rent control measure could help us take back control and keep new developments out of our community.”  I get that deregulation is seen as a Reagan/Clinton era corporate cash grab. Government is big and hard and complicated. Some regulations suck. Others have outlived their usefulness.  I really think the fight between regulation & deregulation is immature, and the nation would be well served to move on from it.

Homebuilding is a small part of what developers do because of these stupid regulations. During a shortage we should absolutely be cutting the dumbest of these regulations, such as parking minimums, minimum lot sizes, large setback requirements and the most restrictive height and density limits. ",Pearberr,2025-03-17T14:10:10,2

We did massively over invest in one form of transportation, we need to invest in multiple forms of transportation, that is the only way to prevent congestion.

It would be a nice windfall for Uber temporarily but in the long run more pedestrian spaces and better public transit, which we can invest in using our new influx of tax dollars, would hurt those companies.

He's trying to undermine democratic norms because he's a technocrat.    >Capitalism requires a strong regulatory state in order to reign in the natural drive towards monopoly and monopsony power. There is no inherent moral value capitalism puts on completion: in terms of pure efficiency you can't really beat a monopoly since you can dictate prices and consumers are forced to abide by them.  Regulatory capture is a more inherent good for businesses since it prevents new competition from starting by increasing the financial obligations to comply with onerous regulations.  Regulations reinforce monopoly.    > More billionaires publicly supported Harris over Trump, sure. But that a) doesn't account for the glut of dark money coursing into the various PACs b) indicates that most billionaires understand that it's in their own best interest to actually have a functional middle class   Here you are basically making a baseless claim about dark money which makes 0 sense since Harris and her associated PACs out raised and out spent Trump, and you are admitting that billonaires understand the value of the middle class and want to build it.

"Harris may have individually raised more than Trump, but actual total spending by Republicans and Democrats was neck in neck at slightly above two billion each. That's what I'm talking about in terms of the dark money. Unless you think the *entirely* of the money spent on Republicans to close the gap in spending was small donations.  https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_campaign_finance,_2024  And I get that it's a matter of faith for libertarian types that regulation is what *actually* causes monopolies. But we have this thing call 'history' we can look at. The regulations you decry largely arose in response to the, yes, *monopolies* that arose in the Gilded Age. Late 19th century America was the exact sort of low regulation, libertarian economic system you're looking for. The result was the hyperrich using their outsized economic power to either acquire or drive competitors out of business. Lack of regulation didn't result in big, bloated companies being outcompeted by agile innovators taking advantage of new opportunities and fresh thinking to rise to prominence. It resulted in those big companies either throwing money at smaller companies to acquire them, or actively running them out of business with either predatory practices such as selling at a loss or actual, active violence. This isn't a hypothetical we're trying to speculate from Econ 101 principles: it's a historical fact we can refer to.  And Musk is playing the long game. He's very explicit  that he wants to make Twitter into a WeChat style walled garden, and expects it to make him more money than Tesla does. He just needs to get rid of those pesky regulators that want to make him do inconvenient and expensive things like 'have enough financial reserves to cover people's deposits', 'protect users financial data' or 'prevent scams'.

"That’s not what I meant by counterfactual.  Your dismissal of my “capitalist claims” was that in your experience, house prices have kept going up despite supply being added. By asking for your counterfactual, I was asking “compared to what scenario?”   To evaluate the claim that expanding the housing supply puts downward pressure on housing prices (a falsifiable claim), we have to establish a way to disprove this claim. Your observation that prices continued to rise does not meet this standard (it does not disprove the claim) because it does not control for other factors of price. If demand continues to increase faster than supply is added, then it could both be true that supply expansion puts downward pressure on prices AND that prices have risen. Rather, the appropriate counterfactual is the scenario in which the supply was never expanded, in which case a proper test would need to identify an otherwise comparable market in which supply expansion did not occur, for example.

"The explanation I am presenting though is not extraordinary, though. It is consistent with the academic consensus among economists for how housing markets work, and for why housing prices can be out of equilibrium. You are presenting the extraordinary claim that housing markets do not respond to supply shocks, and therefore the burden of proof has always been on you.   Beyond that, I never even asked you for evidence. I asked you for your counterfactual to illustrate the fact that you had not even appropriately formulated your framework for evaluation. You presented evidence (even if it is anecdotal), but you were not even yet equipped to consider evidence.
