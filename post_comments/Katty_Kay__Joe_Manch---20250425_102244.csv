Run out of coal money already Joe? ,q1qdev,2025-04-25T10:23:59,21
"""He's doing exactly what he said. People shouldn't be all upset,"" Manchin told me. ""The people who are upset right now lost. This is the system.""  I think he actually said that with a straight face...",TypicalMission119,2025-04-25T10:24:08,13
"Good lord.  ""not working with him because he's in a different party""???   What an idiot.  Not working with him because he's illegally destroying our entire country.",viewfromtheclouds,2025-04-25T10:26:34,27
Blud is a large reason we are in this mess when he hamstringed a lot of Joe's bills.,xxxIAmTheSenatexxx,2025-04-25T10:35:56,7
Did Joe Scarborough edit this piece for Katty Kay? It sure reads that way.,blue_quark,2025-04-25T10:44:16,6
"""[Trump] is the leader of our country. Why would you not work with him? Just because he's a different party? Didn't vote for him? That's not a reason.""  How about, ""He's a narcissistic, idiotic buffoon who pouts like an preteen who tries to bully people to get what he wants, and gets angry and spouts nonsense on social media when he doesn't get it."" Is that a reason?",bourj,2025-04-25T10:29:00,5
Ugh it’s one of those days all I can do is swear. Asshole!,xyz_rick,2025-04-25T13:23:58,3
"Fuck you, Manchin.  Nobody cares what a traitor like you thinks.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-25T11:01:54,3
Fuck off joe.,elijuicyjones,2025-04-25T11:42:59,2
"Everyone keeps burying their heads in the sand even when their own party-members are telling them. You can't have a political party based off nothing besides ""Not-Trump"". Democrats either need to provide significant concessions to the working class or risk losing come re-election time.  ""Well, at least we are not Trump"" is not a viable political slogan or party platform.",kristhedemented,2025-04-25T12:49:48,1
Yeah fuck this dude. He was a POS in the Senate and nothing whatsoever has changed.   Him and Fetterman should go find a quiet corner somewhere and suck each other off.,sp0rkah0lic,2025-04-25T14:50:38,1
Manchin is a traitor.,GilmourD,2025-04-26T18:32:54,1
Yeah.  Because he’s always been a Republican who called himself a Democrat so he could sabotage the Dems from within.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-25T11:03:28,5
"""Instead of opposing Trump destroying the country Democrats should work with Trump to destroy the country.""   Just because he is actively destroying the country doesn't mean Democrats shouldn't work with him.",CockBrother,2025-04-25T11:07:58,5
That’s just not true. He voted with Dems for about 75 percent of his career and every dem justice he’s voted for. And he’s voted against some gop justices. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T11:13:38,3
"Not when it mattered, he didn't.  And he never criticized the GOP for not working with Biden.  He's a republican saboteur, full stop.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-25T11:14:44,7
"What you are witnessing is the ""Facts & Science"" conveniently ignoring the truth when it doesn't fit their narrative. Far easier to paint Manchin as just a big meanie instead of someone who understands the political realities of the working class voters of Appalachia.",kristhedemented,2025-04-25T12:51:03,0
The man  voted to convict trump twice. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T11:18:42,1
And people changes their minds. Never had seen trump pulls so many former democrats into Republican Party and push folks into democrat party. most of us doubts that will changes after trump term ended.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-25T11:23:34,1
Because he knew it wouldn't go anywhere.  It was for show.  He never would have if his had been the deciding vote.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-25T11:22:31,1
