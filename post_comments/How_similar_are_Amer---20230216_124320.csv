A political party with a majority in a provincial parliament can pass whatever law they want. They cannot be recalled or impeached. They can (and in the case of Ontario have) dissolved cities and amalgamated them into one giant one (ex. Toronto). Right now there is a possibility that 3 cities that comprise the Region of Peel next to Toronto may end up being amalgamated into a giant city that will have close to 2 million people.,RogueViator,2023-02-16T16:48:29,12
"Our constitution's 10th amendment in large part says it all  >The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people.  The federal government can do only what the Constitution says it can. The State governments can do everything else without interference by the federal government.",NoTable2313,2023-02-16T21:38:46,9
"There are three main differences: Separation of Powers between the two levels, how courts work and, finally, the political system (Westminster/Parliamentary vs. Presidential).  When it comes to the separation of powers, two principles are different between the US and Canada. The first is that residual powers go to the federal level in Canada while they go to the federated states in the USA (with the caveat in both cases of the Interstate commerce clause or an equivalent thereof in Canada). The second has to do with the criminal laws, which are an exclusive realm of the federal government in Canada, while they are shared in the USA (technically States-level, but the Federal-level also has its own criminal laws). In every other respect, the federated states in both Canada and the US are fully sovereign in theory in their powers, with canadian provinces maaaayybe having the right to enter agreements with other sovereign states pertaining to their powers (the Gérin-Lajoie Doctrine for those in the know, but that one hasn't been tested in the courts.  As for the courts, Canada has an intertwined court system, where the court systems are all provincial with the ""superior courts"" judges named by the federal government with a federal Supreme Court at the top as the final appelate court (yes, there is also a federal court and court of appeals, but it's not really relevant to the discussion here). While in the USA, the federal and states courts are essentially parallel systems that culminate in the SCOTUS as the final appelate court.  Finally, one major key difference is how both countries political system work. In Canada, as the executive can only work if they have the confidence of parliament, that means that, basically, there are fewer checks and balances here, which increases the legitimacy of a political decision by itself, despite the federal government having all the rights, in theory, to disavow a law (power that has never been used in practice). In the USA, the strict separation of power that a presidential system implies means that the checks and balances at the States level is sufficient to make the decision legitimate by itself. That also extends to how executive officials are elected in both cases - elections for specific offices are not uncommon in the USA, while in Canada, for instance, the Premier (which is basically the equivalent of the governor power-wise) has full rights to designate a cabinet, as long as the members are also members of the legislative branch (or are to be members of it, the constitutional custom still allows for some flexibility here). You won't see the AG/Minister of Justice (usually the same person in Canada too) being elected directly, for instance.  I hope that answers your question.",slanifrenchie,2023-02-17T12:07:49,8
Canadian provincial laws are trumped by federal laws. Certain powers are technically sole purview of the provinces but the federal government is often involved with them: Healthcare and Education are provincial responsibilities but the federal government also has major roles in funding them.   Indigenous issues are split between federal and provincial jurisdiction and one of the many ways our indigenous people are messed with is by treating them as hot potatoes.   As mentioned provincial legislatures can't override the federal government / supreme courts... permanently. A province can have a law that is ruled as going against the Charter of rights and freedoms in force for up to 5 years by invoking the Notwithstanding clause.,truncatedChronologis,2023-02-16T20:01:59,6
"I'll just copy my answer:  Canadian provinces are also somewhat sovereign entities in the sense that the federal government can't make laws in areas that belong to them, and technically they also have direct monarchical representation via their lieutenant governors (the monarchy is like a very formal and abstract symbol of power in Canada, and officially all Canadian governments derive their power from it). To make changes to provincial powers, or provinces in general (like adding provinces or changing borders), an amendment needs to be made to the Canadian constitution, which either depends on the majority of the provinces' legislatures agreeing plus the federal government or all of the provinces agreeing plus the federal government (don't remember the details). The provincial legislatures are, similar to the US, modelled on the Canadian federal government with a prime minister (called premier to avoid confusion with their federal counterpart), and their legislative assemblies. The senate isn't really an important part of the Canadian government, so all provinces got rid of theirs at some point in history. This is basically the only difference.  Canada does have governments that derive their power from the federal government in the territories, which functionally act like provinces in every single way, except the constitution doesn't protect the federal government from overruling them on provincial issues because they aren't officially provinces. I don't know how often the federal government intervenes in the territories but there is sort of an understanding that they will become provinces at some point, just that no one wants to reopen the constitution to create those provinces because there is no urgent need.",ref7187,2023-02-16T23:22:20,2
US states are semi-sovereign entities equal in power to the federal government which they ceded some of their power to create. Canadian provinces are simply subdivisions of a unitary government and have no sovereignty.  US states have their own sovereign governments with completely sepeate legislatures and judicial systems from the federal systems.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2023-02-16T18:51:03,-9

That’s not true at all. They’re both federal systems.,rajde1,2023-02-16T19:24:24,10
