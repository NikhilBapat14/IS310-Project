"The content of the messages is pretty damning, but the REAL scandal here, in my mind, is that it seems to be pretty common practice to use a messaging app for official government business that deletes messages after a period of time.  So, unless these people are making copies of the contents of these messages and storing them they are in direct violation of the law regarding the preservation of government records.  I am willing to bet that these are not the only members of the administration using this app, and that it is how everyone inside this White House communicates.  Which means that the law is being knowingly and deliberately violated every day.  In a sane world there would be mass firings and the president himself would be called to testify about how this egregious violation of the law would become standard practice.  In a sane world we’d never elect a president who is so unafraid of Congress that he would allow this to happen on his watch.  But it seems we have taken that sane world out back and killed it dead.  We are in cartoon villain territory here and there are no cartoon heroes around to save the day.",thatthatguy,2025-03-26T22:15:51,248

"Too bad only a couple of people actually read your question, and everybody else is still complaining about Signal chat op-sec instead of the history and politics of Yemen.   I've been following Yemeni politics since 2011. The US has been an incredibly malevolent and destabilizing force in the country, much as it has in the rest of the region for many decades. Its awful that America's ""forever wars"" are continuing with hardly any controversy or public debate. Ironically, the Houthi movement and the wider Ansarallah political movement which governs northern Yemen, is a direct consequence of these ""forever wars"". The Houthi's original anti-imperialist/anti-Western outlook was solidified after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and then they spent the next 8 years fighting against the US-backed dictator of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Even in terms of the specific issue of Ansarallah's embargo against shipping in the Red Sea, it is striking that instead of ensuring a ceasefire in Gaza, the US will just carry out an ineffective bombing campaign. Ansarallah has been extremely clear and consistent about the fact that the embargo is tied with Israel's war on Gaza. Which is why they ended the embargo when the ceasefire was holding, and then re-started it when Israel stopped the negotiations and returned to war.",RKU69,2025-03-27T00:32:18,77

"Just another reflection of a dysfunctional administration who knows that they can disregard the law without being held accountable.   Incompetence aside, they had settings that deleted public records at two weeks. This is illegal. These things are supposed to be part of the public record for a reason.

"As far as I know, Yemen is one of the poorest country in the world, a failed state, most of the population is addicted to khat, and they have way more weapons than inhabitants. It is full of various tribes and religious groups that hate and keep fighting each others.   The U.S. has been bombing the country for years, first because al Quaeda and then because of the Houthi. Saudi Arabia has basically invaded it to prop up its own puppet government. Both have failed to destroy the Houthis with those methods, despite huge numbers of people dying at the result.   So why would anyone expect that bombing the Houthis again would change anything and solve the problem ? They are just doing again what failed in the past because they have no other idea what to do.   I was more shocked by the anti-European comments in their Signal conversation, as if the Houthis were the problem of Europe in particular, rather than a problem for Saudi Arabia, Israel, and everyone who is shipping goods through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, which is basically the whole world. But this administration seems to prefer attacking America's allies rather than America's enemies. With ""friends"" like these...   And of course, the conversation getting leaked to a journalist that way just made the Trump administration look like the total fools they are.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-03-27T11:58:15,5

"Using Signal is pretty egregious but tbh it’s just a confirmation of other reports that the Trump administration is sloppy with information and security. It’s unacceptable and is going to get Americans (and non American intelligence assets) killed, especially now that it’s so obvious the admin is not taking security seriously. I don’t see accountability coming for anybody except Waltz but would be delighted by Congress doing more than handwringing.   The issue that catches my attention is the casual anti-Europe and transactional tone regarding geopolitics. I’m a US citizen and wrote plenty of essays on how power projection and coalition building works in APUSH. The US gets tons and tons and tons of benefits by being “the good guy” and providing international aid or military support. It’s hard to overstate the benefits of being the first phone call when pirates in Somalia take over a cargo ship, Houthi rebels get too close for comfort, or a tsunami wipes out every power pole on an island. These private chats show how the admin broadly, but specifically Hegseth, Vance, and Trump genuinely don’t like Europe (or Egypt, apparently) and view them as a cost center rather than a partner.  This cost-first view is common in business / MBA land but doesn’t work on a global scale, especially when the US is trying to build and maintain cultural hegemony. There are not infinite trading partners and we just called our closest buddies a gadfly.",qu4f,2025-03-27T04:16:55,4

"You missed an important part of the Yemeni story. After 9/11 the Saudi's ejected Al-Qaeda from the country, they moved to Yemen, reinforcing the existing AQ militia and formed AQAP - Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That event is what kicked the conflict into high gear. Saudi backed the Yemeni government militarily because it was fighting a proxy war on behalf of the US.  Back in 2017 under Trump I the US went on the offensive, degrading the group's capabilities. By 2018-2019, AQAP was at war with numerous government backed proxy forces including the Houthis.  In the process of fighting AQAP the Houthis inherited a lot of their weapons and ammunition, and gained political support.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_the_Arabian_Peninsula#2009%E2%80%932010:_Early_years  The Houthi's began in the nineties as a relatively moderate Zaydi Shia organisation but became increasingly militant as they sought to combat Saudi-influenced ideologies (meaning Sunni influenced), but also participated in the 'Arab Spring' of 2011, known locally as the Yemeni Revolution, this led to them gaining territory. Within the year, they controlled three governorates, which gained them access to the Red Sea and the ability to attack the capital. By 2015 they had seized the presidential palace and Sunni nations in the region formed a multi country coalition with US support to attack them.  Basically, the Houthis were able to successfully use the power vacuum created by the pushback on AQAP and the Arab Spring to become a stable political and military force. Observers believe a more stable force than the actual government.  The war, US/Saudi backed naval blockade, created a famine which caused to 85,000 children under five to starve to death since 2015, along with who knows how many others.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis#History  Being Shia, of course Iran is pushing money and weapons to the Houthi's, and using them as a proxy to attack Israel and US interests.  So Trump has history in Yemen, he declared the Houthi's a terrorist organisation in 2021, which Biden reversed in order to allow humanitarian aid into the region and end the famine. Trump regards this as a failure, in as much Trump thinks, you could more accurately say Trump's Saudi friends regard this as a failure, and want to go on the offensive.  This is one of 18 current Islamist Terrorist insurgencies in Africa and the Middle East which links back to the global war on terror. In addition to 12 wars this is what is driving the migration crisis destabilising Europe.",epsilona01,2025-03-27T03:00:18,12
"Although every terrorist strike in the US has come from Saudi Arabia or the terrorists were radicalized there, and none have come from Iran, we have allied with the Saudis.  Iran(Shia) and Saudi Arabia(Sunni) are the two main branches of Islam that are fighting each other in a regional battle for control, and the Houthis are allied with Iran. They have been fighting with the Saudis for years, the Saudis have been using US munitions to bomb them for years.   The US will continue to bomb the Houthis and provide weapons to the Saudis to fight the Houthis.  As for the amateurs at the top of our government, they were selected for their blind loyalty to Trump, not for being competent or experienced in their field. In fact, Trump does not want experienced and competent people at the head of US agencies, they tend to be independent and Trump won't tolerate that.

"This really isn't about the attack itself. Part of the problem of dealing with such groups is that you can't ignore them, you can't really engage diplomatically with them, and they exist among the civilian population so military force and economic sanctions are both going to have civilian collateral damage. So while I don't care for it, I also don't have a realistic alternative that also addresses the problems they pose. In all honesty, this is where programs like USAID can help. Soft American diplomacy and aid to the civilian population mean a more favorable view of the US on the ground, so that less people turn to the anti-US factions. Yemen isn't probably the best use case of that specifically, but it can and has helped other places.  As for the Signal Scandal, it really just highlights the cavalier attitude this administration has with propriety. This is the one they got caught with, but anyone who doesn't think this is indicative about how these people are handling what should be classified materials is out of touch with reality. The problem wasn't that they accidently invited a reporter into the group, it's that none of them, who damn well should have known better, didn't think to say, ""this is not the proper medium for this information"".

If the Houthis are allowed to disrupt shipping lanes consequence-free, you set a terrible precedent. I think that strikes against the Houthis are, at least on face, justifiable.   But because the Trump admin has dropped the level of effort needed to reduce civilian casualties from the Biden admin to a very low level, I think they could end up only strengthening Houthi support in Yemen.",kerouacrimbaud,2025-03-28T09:39:16,2

You do realize that we were already bombing Yemen yes? Like they just added command elements to the list of targets that the Biden administration was already bombing.

"You heard it here first (totally 100% opinion): The Signal group chat debacle was a scripted reality TV stunt to strategically message a major US policy shift (The US is soon no longer safeguarding shipping lanes near the red sea, as it has for decades) and attempt to shift responsibility to Europe (e.g. Italy, France, Spain, etc).  It all happened as reported, but appears to be pre-planned to achieve a desired effect.   I read the chatlogs they published and they appear to be 60% honest-ish (the operational data surrounding the Houthi strikes, two hours prior--wouldn't have done them much good + they already probably knew), and 40% manipulative (the whole ""Europe is freeloading"" narrative the Trump officials give on securing the Red Sea and overall rationale is half-truths at best). From what's been leaked to the media so far, these appear to be the only two topics discussed/reported on in the group chat)    It may even be a dramatization intended for an audience of European leaders, trying to negotiate/delineate areas of responsibilities for geographic middle eastern hotspots (e.g. Europe is in charge of dealing with the houthis moving forward).

"I don’t know what you mean by ‘you people’.  I did not mention Israel but if you want my thoughts on Israel…the Israeli state was setup post the absolute the atrocities against Jewish citizens of various countries during World War 2.  I grew up watching remembrance ceremonies and movies with the word ‘Lest we forget’ drilled into my brain.  I felt survivors of WWII tried their best to remind the world of what hatred can do to others whilst never understanding at that point how so many people could have partaken in the atrocities caused by Hitler and his followers.  I still do not understand it but I do see hate breed hate.  I do not think the Israeli state at the time of creation considered the peoples occupying the land where the state was created and this has lead to unrest in the area. I do not blame the Jewish people for this but the ‘allies’ who most likely did not see those occupants as ‘people’ because they were not Caucasian??  I cannot say what their thought process was. I do recognise the 2 state solution as the only humane way forward. The Israeli state does not want this, stating they feel Hamas (a terrorist organisation) wants to annihilate them.  This is likely a truly felt fear for many Israelis, however Hamas do not have the means to do this, which is evident by the comparatively low death toll and destruction of towns and cities compared to the attempt ethnically cleanse the Palestinian.  I condemn the taking of Israeli hostages by Hamas but watching the detestation of Palestine post that event and hearing the justifications used by Government for their ethnic cleansing of civilians in Palestine shows me that they hate the Palestinian’s every bit as much as they fear they are hated and want to destroy them AND have the means.  The Israeli state has performed multiple war crimes and anyone who calls them out is accused of being anti Semitic.  For the record, I am not antisemitic, religion has never meant anything to me personally beyond my observation of where people have religion they appear happier and can give people purpose but religion can also cause so many divides where it is used as an excuse to allow the worst of humanity cause others immense pain and suffering. By the way…the more I write this the more I understand how people may have felt during WWII because I wonder did people comply because they feared what would happen if they did not fall in line and stop questioning what they were likely told was the right and just hatred they should hold towards a people despite what the knew was morally the right thing to feel about a peoples ethnic cleansing.",[deleted],2025-03-27T07:25:14,0

"The Houthis have not been erratic at all about their reasoning and motivation for trying to enforce a shipping embargo - its about pressuring Israel and the world to stop the bloody assault on Gaza. They've been *very* consistent on this. When Israel was engaging in the ceasefire from December through February, the Houthis ended the embargo; they only re-started it when the war started (or more specifically, when Israel started once again blocking aid shipments from entering Gaza).  Meanwhile, the US was already attempting to stop the Houthis militarily under Biden, via ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"". This has been widely seen as a failure. I.e. see [this analysis](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/a-draw-is-a-win-the-houthis-after-one-year-of-war/) from Westpoint CTC.   Do you think there is some new strategy or set of tactics that the Trump DoD will deploy that will be more effective? Why is more bombings and destruction the best way forward, instead of the one that *already* solved the issue - pushing Israel into a ceasefire?",RKU69,2025-03-27T13:39:56,5

"Houthis are doing this because Iran tells them to. It's in no way in their interests to get bombed by the US and the average Yemeni doesn't care much about the plight of the Palestinians.  The US is doing it for two reasons, neither of which has anything to do with Gaza.  The first is economic -- the Red Sea is important for trade.  The second is to further weaken Iran's allies. The US does not want Iran to get a nuclear bomb and is seriously considering bombing Iran's nuclear facilities if it can't negotiate a solution. Trump has threatened this and there's both bi-partisan and international support for it.  If the US (or Israel) bombs Iran, Iran will retaliate against Israel, and will use its proxies in that response. Israel's anti-missile defense is strong, but is vulnerable to being overwhelmed. If the Houthis' ability to attack Israel is diminished, it becomes safer to attack Iran.  None of this is ""US wants more dead Gazan kids.""",bl1y,2025-03-29T15:03:30,1

"Yea people are unhappy that America acts as the world police. Yet they just want to complain about it. They don't want a solution. They want to be angry. And people love to be angry at whoever is on top.  The solution is to not have America be the main provider for the UN. That other countries can protect their own interests. But then that would mean having to spend money on their militaries and take away from social programs that their citizens have come to rely on.  So they bitch and moan, but at the end of the day take it, because the alternative is worse. And they know that, at least the heads of state know that. They rely on both American support through financial aid as well as security.  To have any real change done to this structure, countries will need to start rejecting American Aid & Security, while fully supporting their own. Of course again, we're back to cutting social programs to fund that endeavor, something their citizens currently aren't willing to bear.  But who knows.
