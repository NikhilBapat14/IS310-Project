"Interview with John Stewart and Ezra Klein, ""Why We Can't Have Nice Things."" A discussion picks up starting at 19:45 through 37:15 regarding the Rural broadband plan in the Infrastructure Act. https://youtu.be/NcZxaFfxloo?si=8oouclJ3RgNrQBPJ  Even shovel ready to go road construction projects, the estimated time frame completion date might be 2027 for a bill passed in 2021.   Lyndon Johnson after passing Medicare took a year to get a Medicare Card. After passing ACA, it took years before realization of the act.   When the actual benefits are stretched out further into the future, and people don't see the results, the government must be broken!   If, a catastrophic economic downturn were to occur and Democrats were actually able to be elected, is there a plan? Easily implemented with relatively fast tangible results?   A serious topic that's just over the horizon is Technological Singularity. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity  Advances in AI combined with Quantum computers and robotics promises two potential pathways: Dystopian or Utopian.    The Dystopian future nightmare that science fiction writers and movies are based on such as the Terminator series of movies, Blade runner, etc, where AI robots have gone crazy.   Utopian Future is The Jetsons, flying cars and Rosie the robot.   Whatever the actual outcome might be, Technological Singularity is just around the corner.     Future Shock, by Alvin Toffler expressed the concept of rapid acceleration of technology that far eclipses human beings abilities of adaptation. Prior shifts in society and culture happened slower, however the speed of the shift is accelerating. Transition to agrarian age, bronze age, industrial revolution, information age and now Technological Singularity. With each shift technology used in peace was then used in warfare. Plows into swords. Technology advances in war then used in peace. Radar and the microwave.   **Hard to explain to people exactly what skills they need.**   We are arriving at this critical moment now and very little attention is being provided to this issue. Let's take just a few industries and jobs.   Transportation industry. An all out race is occuring to create self driving vehicles. A driver of any description is no longer required. There's roughly 3.5 million truck drivers in the US alone.   Retail industry. Brick and mortar retail stores already have introduced self checkout. The automated cleaning and restocking robots are coming. Walmart has 2.1 million employees alone.   Restaurant industry. Already seen the self ordering kiosk and the instant pizza machine. There's a restaurant nearby that uses a robot to deliver the food to the table.   Medical industry. I have a relative that had brain surgery. The doctor sat behind a computer screen and pushed a button. I have another relative that just acquired a PhD in Nuero Optometry and sees their job changing. Sit down and connect a machine to a patient that automatically scans the eyes and creates a diagnosis and treatment options.   Need advice? AI is right there. Quickly scanning the information provided and provides an answer within a split second.   AI creating machines that fixes machines and suddenly machines have obsoleted humans. Maybe not all jobs simultaneously, perhaps in a somewhat jerking motion instead.     Where are the jobs that pay a livable wage? Stubborn long term unemployment is potentially in the future.   In Economics, there's a term known as the Gini Index Coefficient. Really just a fancy way of saying wealth inequality of a country. The higher the number, the greater the wealth inequality. Lower numbers results in less wealth inequality.   Studies have been conducted going through history of countries around the world and some basic observations regarding higher wealth inequality have been made. Higher wealth inequality can create a myriad of adverse issues within a country such as a larger population experiencing food, safety, shelter issues. More medical issues. Society instability leading to either gradual or sudden change of government institutions. Worse, high Gini Index can have the propensity for violence. The Gini Index is just a calculation and makes no claims whatsoever regarding potential outcomes. The CIA tracks the Gini Index Coefficient numbers of countries globally and publishes data.    https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/gini-index-coefficient-distribution-of-family-income/country-comparison/  Compare Gini Index Coefficient by country and the list of ongoing conflicts. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts  ""..There are currently 56 conflicts, the most since World War II. They have become more international with 92 countries involved in conflicts outside their borders, the most since the GPI‚Äôs inception."" https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=World%20War%20II-,There%20are%20currently%2056%20conflicts%2C%20the%20most%20since%20World%20War,major%20conflicts%20in%20the%20future.  A perfect storm is unfolding. Tariffs applied against allies that assuredly will kick off a global trade war. Technology Singularity that is just around the corner. Rising Gini Index Coefficient numbers will assuredly follow. The highest number of conflicts since WWII. Just as the League of Nations demonstrated ineptitude and failed to prevent annexation and acts of aggression leading to WWII, the United Nations is increasingly overwhelmed. History tends to repeat itself. All of the ingredients are actually available for a nasty global conflict.   What's the plan? A sober New Deal that can be implemented with fast tangible results? Addressing domestic issues and returning the United States as a trusted ally and partner for stability.",Bocasun,2025-04-04T00:13:17,6
"We absolutely have fallen into the culture war. The progressive reaches of this party believe men can play sports with women and started attacking Gavin Newsome for having some common sense on the issue. When the house passed HR734 to stop transgender women from competing against cis women, the senate tabled it and Biden publicly said he would veto it if they ever pass. Then we had Maine‚Äôs governor deciding transgender athletics was her hill to go to war with Trump on. We‚Äôve done nothing to distance ourselves from these incredibly unpopular ideas, and in some cases we encourage the debate. We need a candidate who is willing to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about it, let the states make the laws they want to.‚Äù   I really don‚Äôt think we did enough to go out and connect with midwesterners the way Obama did. In the mid 2000s Democrats were driving out to farms and little 2000 people factory towns to ask how we can help them specifically and heard their gripes. Now we just trust that we can stay in the big city, hold a rally, and try to educate them on why they‚Äôre wrong through a TV screen. Propping up a fake candidate who wasn‚Äôt in the primaries and was given barely 30 days to construct a phony campaign doesn‚Äôt help, but I really only remember Biden doing that once during 2024.   Get out and show these blue collar folks exactly how you‚Äôre going to make their bills cheaper, exactly how you‚Äôre going to expand their health coverage, exactly how you can guarantee their workplace protections. We haven‚Äôt done that, we are constantly on the defensive playing catch-up trying to educate these people as to why tariffs won‚Äôt work.
