">If we googled everything would we ever have a reason to speak with each other?  Yes, actually.  I think it's a great idea to provide sources which support the argument you're making - I'll do it quite often in debates.

Perhaps you should evaluate the veracity of an article based on the strengths of its claims, which you can verify with other sources when you are skeptical of something they claimed.  Its important to be mindful of their, as well as your own, preexisting biases when doing so, and constantly thinking about what isn't being said, but just being like *isn't Al Jazeera news from The Bad Guys* and ignoring their perspective entirely isn't doing yourself any favors if you have any interest in learning how the world works.

"Whew ok -- good morning/afternoon by the way and happy Saturday -- I see you question dismissing a newspaper simply based on it being owned by a theocratic ruler who imprisons people for tweets. On that, you and I simply disagree. I WILL outright dismiss it *as a reliable source*. Sure, a broken clock is correct twice a day and many of their articles hold truth, but an unbiased source, from the ruler of Qatar, when the balance of the middle east rests partly on this election? Hell no.   The OP didn't ask 'what are some sources that aren't totally trustworthy but that I'll be able to spend time countering with other sources until I uncover the buried truth?' I think they want to do as little reading as possible.   I just don't see the value in the exercise you propose, and it is definitely not what OP was asking for. OP is not trying to bolster their own argument and counter others. They simply want some fair info, quickly, easily.   I also did not say to ignore al jazeera. We all encounter AJ articles all the time. But is it what OP was looking for - an unbiased source? No.   I just remembered -- Qatar also financially backs Hamas, who is obviously a party to one of two major ongoing international wars, and are sort of, like, bad dudes. Like really bad dudes.

"You are correct in knowing I will not change my mind at this point in the election, and I do appreciate a good question!  Simply put, do you think the president should have complete power over everything?  I think it is a testement to his integrity by going through the courts, instead of trying to use his presidental power. Should he have used that power, I think it would have been akin to the coop of installing Kamala as the candidate for presidency. (I will die on this hill that her being where she is, is a complete slap in the face to the entire population of liberals in this country)  I think if he had ""Secured"" the 2020 election, it could have only ended badly. It would have felt like an implied dictatorship, and nobody could have supported that in good intentions. Going through the courts and fighting it legally was the most American thing I think he could have done. And for that, I think he is highly deserving of consideration for office again!  May I ask, I have a highly intellegent friend. He has some incredible insight into the current political situation in these United States, in that the current election is much like Germany's election, that put in Adolf Hitler.  Do you think this election is as make-or-break as the legacy media implies? Or is it just trying to get the people out to vote?",Whitetailnh,2024-10-28T14:23:46,1
">I WILL outright dismiss it as a reliable source.   If their coverage is as bad as you believe it to be, certainly you're smart enough to figure out why an article would be misleading, no?  Are you saying you'll read it, but you'll just be skeptical?  That's just the attitude you should have for ANY source, so why do you think it merits mention?  >I think they want to do as little reading as possible.  If they don't look at an issue from multiple perspectives with a critical eye, good chance that they'll wind up grossly misinformed on the matter and frankly might have been better off remaining completely ignorant.  Either gain some media literacy and brush up on Manufacturing Consent, or ignore the news entirely, IMO.  >I like NPR <3  Which is ironic because NPR is the American news outlet MOST like Al Jazeera, what with the government funding.  The difference is that you don't see US imperialism and warmongering to be so problematic compared to those responding to it.  You believe Al Jazeera is biased because they're, as you call it, ""pro-Hamas"", but you don't extend that same criticism to establishment western media, including NPR, CNN, NYT, WaPo etc. which are all deeply pro-Zionist.  Why is that, you think?  Is it just more ""biased"" to be opposed to genocide compared to carrying out genocide?",Zeydon,2024-10-26T12:07:12,2
">integrity by going through the courts, instead of trying to use his presidental power.  >fighting it legally  You seem to appreciate his official handling of the point. To be clear, is he, in your opinion completely free from any blame of what happened on January 6th? Not responsible in any way and nothing he could have done to have prevented that escalation?   Additionally, since you praise the use of the legal system, do you also acknowledge the outcome of these cases? It would be rather hypocritical to praise the legal system only when it rules in your favor no?   I'll intentionally avoid the other topics as we both know those will not lead to a meaningful discussion.

"I didn't say they're biased because they're pro Hamas. I said they're biased because they financially back a warring party in an escalating conflict. I don't think AJ and the Qatari government are separable like NPR and USA.   I believe that, despite the subsidies from government grants dedicated to the arts, NPR is not 'owned' by the US government and does not take direction from it, like AJ does. I do not believe NPR is a voice of the current American administration which is how it would be if it was controlled by the federal government. I do not think NPR'S relationship to the American government is the equivalent of AJ's to the Qatari, despite funding from the national broadcasting act.  I don't know how to do the quote thing, but you said that I don't extend the same criticism of bias to the pro-israel papers like NYT and WaPo. I'll just take this opportunity to say that I think NYT, CNN and WaPo are biased and I don't recommend them as an individual, one-stop shop for unbiased election info for someone who wants quick answers. Get that cleared up there. However, they are still not equivalent. I do not know that Jeff bezos arms the IDF. They are biased for other reasons I guess.   But you included NPR and called them pro-zionist. If you mean they are pro Israel-existing-as-a-country, I can not argue that, as only a monster would argue for the eradication of an entire country. But if you mean supportive of netanyahu's administration's actions, you clearly haven't been listening to NPR.

I do praise Trumps use of the legal system, not the legal system itself. I do believe that there is enough evidence to highly question the outcome of the 2020 election, but not enough to overturn it in any meaningful way. From the legal perspective, I agree with the courts that Trump was not declared winner of the 2020 election, and as such find Biden's term to be legitimate.

">I don't think AJ and the Qatari government are separable like NPR and USA.  I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that matter.    One example of their editorial bias would be like how they're calling this most recent strike by Israel a retaliation:  [Israel conducts retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian military targets](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran)  when they didn't call Iran's strike against Israel a retaliation, even though it also was a retaliation:  [How Iran’s missile strike on Israel appears to have hit some targets](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran)  Editorial bias in headlines and articles (being selective as to when to use passive voice etc.), is one significant vector by which media outlets [manufacture consent,](https://youtu.be/34LGPIXvU5M?si=5V1j4SrMS2eVCYs1) though there are of course, others, such as choosing which stories to cover in the first place and how much coverage to give them.  Another example of this selective use of passive voice is how western outlets consistently will be like ""Hamas *kills* Israeli..."" on the one hand but say ""Palestinians die..."" without attributing those deaths to Israel.  >In a 2011 study conducted by the Glasgow Media Group on the news broadcasts of the BBC, the differences in the language used by journalists for Israelis and Palestinians was documented.  >The study found that the BBC used terms such as “atrocity”, “brutal murder”, “mass murder”, “brutal cold-blooded murder”, “lynching” and “massacre” to describe the deaths of Israelis, and that the word “terrorist” was often associated with Palestinians.  >In a similar vein, this time around in the ongoing conflict, it is quite significant to note that the Western press did not mention that the Gaza hospital attack, which killed 500 people, was carried out by Israel.  >The fact that **the New York Times changed its headlines after the hospital attack – first to “Israeli attack”, then to “attack on the hospital in Gaza”, and finally to “explosion at the hospital in Gaza”** – indicates that the use of rhetorical figures, or in other words, euphemism, to reduce the severity of the violent act.  >This headline of the Washington Post – “Hundreds feared dead in Gaza hospital attack, Palestinian officials say” – creates a perception as if the Palestinians died not as a result of an attack but for some other, unknown reason.

I don't think it's at all monstrous to call for the end of an apartheid, though.  Doesn't necessarily matter if a unified state is called Israel or Palestine so long as all living there have equal rights - though I do think Palestine would be a more fitting name as it has a longer history and isn't associated with a genocidal settler-colonial apartheid regime.  >I don't know how to do the quote thing  Start each quoted paragraph with one of these bad boys: ""\>""  >Another edit: quit downvoting me for disagreeing with you, you big sensitive blubber whale.

No cognitive dissonance here.  Now, let's turn the coin over for a moment here.  I support Trump BECAUSE of all that has happened.  He has dealt with political persecution ever since he started to perform well in the 2016 election.   He has been shot at.   He has been convicted of felonies on misdemenor charges.   He has been dragged though the mud.   He has been slandered.  And still among all of this, he has continued to be a fighter for the American public, Democrat or Republican.
