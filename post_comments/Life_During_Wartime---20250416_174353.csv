"Note trump is the asshat acting it out.  The maga house and senate, and scotus really are the true fascists.",smell-my-elbow,2025-04-16T17:52:18,65
"Well, what did SCOTUS expect? They did, after all, give him full immunity while acting as president. Fuckers. I bet they don't think it's so funny now, eh?",BustAMove_13,2025-04-16T19:39:18,33
"It's been here since Rump's first term. He just didn't have enough full on SS members in his government to pull of an internal coup the first time. Now that he does, he simply waiting for the perfect moment to put his plan in motion. Although I'm not an activist or a revolutionary, I'll become one if Rump declares himself der fuhrer or supreme leader of the US and be on the first train to Washington to lead the good fight.",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-16T20:09:33,13

"Heard of a van that's loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway A place where nobody knows  The sound of gunfire, off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in a ghetto I've lived all over this town  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing, or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now  Transmit the message to the receiver Hope for an answer someday I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name  High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime I might not ever get home  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around This ain't no Mudd Club, or CBGB I ain't got time for that now  Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, PA? You oughta know not to stand by the window Somebody see you up there  I got some groceries, some peanut butter To last a couple of days But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones Ain't got no records to play  Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard I ain't got time for that now  Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock We blended in with the crowd We got computers, we're tapping phone lines I know that that ain't allowed  We dress like students, we dress like housewives Or in a suit and a tie I changed my hairstyle, so many times now I don't know what I look like  You make me shiver, I feel so tender We make a pretty good team Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving You ought to get you some sleep  Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won't help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace The burning keeps me alive",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-16T17:45:03,16

Steven Miller and Trump lied. Saying that the supreme Court favor them in a 0-9 ruling. If y'all gonna tell a lie. Make it believable like 6-3 ruling,OhioRanger_1803,2025-04-16T21:02:57,6

"Have to make space in The Hague for all the bad actors when this all ends, one way or another. Or a faster solution is to send all the administration down to El Salvador's prison for a free lifetime vacation. We can put a webcam in tRump's cell for everyone who suffered by him to watch justice live.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-16T18:00:52,21
"You'll never convince me that someone didn't cut them a nice check for *that* favor. I don't trust this ""Supreme court"", for as far as I can throw them. The most corrupt version I have ever seen in my lifetime.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-16T20:51:20,15

"Some of these people think that it can't be ""that bad"" to live in a fascist country, because they look at places like Russia and Hungary and think that those are examples of ""normal"" countries. And they also have this weird belief that just because they're on the ""good side"", that their lives will just carry on as normal. They're going to find out *real quick*, that it doesn't quite work out like that.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-16T20:56:36,4
