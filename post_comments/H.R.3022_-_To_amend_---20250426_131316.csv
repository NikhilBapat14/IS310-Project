"Not sure ehat the ""other purposes"" will be, but the repealing the ban on provider owned hospitals will have bi-partisan support.  A consequence of ObamaCare has been a rapid consolidation of healthcare into very large conglomerates.  That has some benefits, but smaller providers are left with a more difficult path to compete.  This should increase competition, which is usually never a bad thing.",Never_Really_Right,2025-04-26T13:27:57,14

"This would actually be good. The ban on provider-owned hospitals has decreased competition in the health care space and resulted in large conglomerate systems owning everything, while also reducing physician control of the healthcare they provide. ",DarkestNight0,2025-04-26T13:32:24,-5

"Do you think that doesn't happen at corporately owned hospitals?  What do you think the No Surpises acts was supposed to prevent?    The competition here would be between private hospitals and provider owned ones.    The threat to public hospitals will remain a pathetic lack of funding, and lack of political will to put people over profits.  That will sadly remain whether or not this legislation passes.",Never_Really_Right,2025-04-26T16:35:21,5
A hospital owned by doctors where doctors make key decisions about the facilities’ operations and care.   How is this worse than private equity owned hospitals?,Antique-Scholar-5788,2025-04-26T14:37:57,3
"Why don’t we just look at the history of POH in the US and understand the issue with that?   A hospital is not the same as like a private practice, it’s a public service.   It’s not like I am arguing it’s better than private equity either. I think hospitals are a public service and should be owned and operated by the government.   I am still speaking as to the reason why POHs were banned.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T15:22:44,12
POH’s were banned because of lobbying from the American Hospital Association to decrease competition. Government owned hospitals were never on the table.,Antique-Scholar-5788,2025-04-26T15:39:27,8
"The idea of “competition” in hospital care is a fake goal. There’s no real consumer choice when someone’s unconscious after a car accident or having a heart attack — you go wherever the ambulance takes you, and you have zero ability to shop around or negotiate. Treating hospitals like a normal competitive market completely ignores the reality that patients usually don’t choose when or how they need care. On top of that, framing this fight as a noble physician-owned savior battling a villainous hospital lobby is dishonest. It’s just two interest groups — neither of which represents patients — fighting over who gets to control a market where the customers have no real agency. Both sides are trying to extract as much money as they can from people who are at their most vulnerable.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T16:33:06,7
"Hospitals include more than emergent or inpatient care. Most of the care is outpatient, where patients have a choice where they receive care.   The issue is that one interest group succeeded in banning the other interest group from running hospitals, thereby limiting competition.   Either anyone should run a hospital or only the government should run a hospital. Allowing only certain special interest groups to run hospitals is the worst of all scenarios.",Antique-Scholar-5788,2025-04-26T16:38:33,5
"I think you're trying to argue a point that no one is making.  For profit health care sucks.  Period.  I don't see anyone in this thread saying otherwise, much less the pserson you are responding to.  But allowing the corporate giants to continue consolidation of the hospital industry just keeps it as horrible as possible.  This legislation, if it passes, may increase competition.  And when you are stuck with a crappy for profit system, that is not a bad thing.   It should not impact not for profit or public hospitals.  Those are struggling, and will continue to struggle, due to a sad lack of funding.  Their worst ""competition"" is the federal, state and local authorities who refuse to provide adequate funding, or dund the mecanisms that can provide funding (such as medicaid and ACA subsidies.)",Never_Really_Right,2025-04-26T16:50:14,3
"Regulation rollback is not a solution. You need to start by understanding why the regulation existed in the first place.  You’re repeating AHA’s bad faith arguments without realizing that there are much deeper problems with POHs — problems consumers care about — beyond just what AHA says.  Imagine you have three players all with their own interests: AHA, POHs, and consumers. When consumers point at POHs and say, “this is a problem,” and AHA also says, “this is a problem,” that doesn’t mean they agree on why it’s a problem.  Consumers have their own reasons — reasons that matter. And when you dismiss the regulation just because AHA supported it, you’re throwing out legitimate consumer concerns too.  There are real, serious reasons why POHs are bad for healthcare that have nothing to do with helping AHA.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T17:40:01,2
" You’re missing why POHs were restricted in the first place.  This isn’t about “a little more competition.” It’s about rolling back regulations that were put there because POHs were already gaming the system — cherry-picking profitable patients, dumping expensive ones onto community hospitals, and bleeding public resources.  Saying this will make things “less bad” is like saying the EPA should loosen pollution rules because it might make energy cheaper. It ignores why the rules exist: to stop the worst actors from wrecking the system for everyone else.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T17:32:00,6
"Sure, there were problems with POH’s. But the alternative has been private equity owned hospitals, which have been associated with increased costs and increased complications for patients. It’s part of the reason for the sky rocketing health care costs.   You initially stated there was a reason that POH’s were banned. That reason had nothing to do with costs or outcomes, but due to lobbying from interest groups and concessions from the Obama administration to appease hospital groups.",Antique-Scholar-5788,2025-04-26T17:55:20,2
"You are saying provider operated hospitals could cherry pick patients, but patients go where the ambulance takes them (true), and corporate hospitals have regulations that applied only to them but not to provider owned because they did not/could not dump patients (they do though.)  So, specifically what regulations applied to corporate owned hospitals that did not apply to provider operated?",Never_Really_Right,2025-04-26T19:22:56,2
"POHs were restricted because they damaged the broader healthcare system in ways that directly hurt consumers. They cherry-picked the healthiest, most profitable patients, which weakened full-service hospitals that depend on a mix of cases to stay financially viable. POHs generally avoided offering emergency rooms or trauma care, forcing public and nonprofit hospitals to absorb the most expensive, complex cases without the balancing revenue from lower-risk patients. This model disrupted the financial cross-subsidization that hospitals rely on to fund critical but money-losing services like ICUs, emergency departments, and specialized care units. As a result, overall healthcare costs increased, access to comprehensive care shrank, and stability across the system eroded, especially in rural and underserved areas where hospitals operate on thinner margins.  The regulation wasn’t about protecting any one special interest group. It was about stopping a business model that privatized profits and socialized costs, hollowing out the safety-net healthcare infrastructure that everyone ultimately depends on.  Physicians are fully within their rights to own and operate private practices. That has never been restricted, and it is a core part of healthcare in the U.S. The issue is when a private practice seeks hospital status — because hospitals receive significant advantages, including higher Medicare reimbursements, access to public funding mechanisms, and regulatory protections intended for institutions that provide full-spectrum, community-serving care. When private practices are allowed to claim hospital privileges without fulfilling the obligations that come with them, it undermines the entire structure of healthcare delivery, pushing costs up and care availability down for everyone else.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T18:23:56,3
"Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, amended by [Section 6001 of the ACA](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/pdf/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), restricts physician-owned hospitals from expanding or billing Medicare if they have self-referral conflicts. The restriction exists because when doctors could refer patients to hospitals they owned, it led directly to cherry-picking, inflated costs, weakened full-service hospitals, and widespread fraud against Medicare and Medicaid. Doctors would offload high-risk, expensive patients onto hospitals they didn’t own, while steering low-risk, high-profit cases into their own facilities. That’s not competition — it’s structured exploitation.  Hospitals and doctors are separated by law to protect consumers. Hospitals aren’t allowed to interfere with medical referrals, and doctors aren't supposed to profit directly from where they send patients. That separation exists for the same reason we restricted pharmaceutical companies from financially influencing doctors’ prescribing habits. When financial interests start dictating medical decisions, consumers lose.  If you want to understand this properly, you can start here:  - [ACA Section 6001 (POH restrictions)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/pdf/PLAW-111publ148.pdf) - [Stark Law - 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395nn) - [EMTALA - 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd) - [Physician Payments Sunshine Act - 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7h](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320a-7h) - [MedPAC Report on POHs (March 2005)](https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/import_data/scrape_files/docs/default-source/reports/Mar05_Ch05.pdf) - [MedPAC Report on POHs (June 2010)](https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/import_data/scrape_files/docs/default-source/reports/Jun10_Ch02.pdf) - [OIG Reports on POH Fraud and Abuse](https://oig.hhs.gov/)  Repealing these protections without proposing real solutions isn’t reform — it’s deregulating a proven abuse model.  This debate already happened, it was settled for good reason, and I'm not interested in pretending otherwise. If you want to keep arguing, take it up with the actual case law and evidence. I'm done.  This wasn’t just about protecting hospital corporations. CMS, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, supported the restrictions because they were seeing real abuses and rising costs tied to provider-owned hospitals.  Repealing these protections without offering any solutions would reopen the same problems that justified the regulations in the first place.  Stop arguing about whether this helps or hurts AHA. I don’t care about AHA. I’m talking about the consumer harms, the destabilization of healthcare delivery, and the very real evidence that justified these restrictions decades ago.",Dadarian,2025-04-26T19:58:54,4
"What percentage of people, do you think, arrive at an ER via ambulance? It's about 15%.  Of that 15%, how many of those people, or their immediate family members there, weren't able to communicate where they wanted to be treated? Likely a small minority. I was asked where I wanted to go after being hit in a vehicle. I was also asked where I wanted my son transported when he needed an ambulance ride to the ER.  The vast .majority of a hospital's patients aren't even going to the ER!",vertigo72,2025-04-26T19:36:48,1
