"What an absolute clown. There is an idiotic concept in America that if you are ""big"" or ""tough"" man that somehow you can ""win"" arguments in the way that you win fights and you can deliver sound ideas simply because you have aggresive feelings and a deep, loud voice.   This ape belongs on a jobsite doing phyiscal labor where people as large and fierce as he is, but who also have brains, can yell at him and tell him what to do all day.   This is also true of fighters and other bearded podcasters who think the width of their shoulders indicates to the complexity of their brains. Back to the pits with you imbeciles - you made your choice in this life, and mental development was not what you chose.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-30T07:53:13,14

"His misrepresentation of himself during the election affects all of us, but I would feel particularly wronged if I lived in Pennsylvania.  That is some seriously messed up fraud, right there.",nikkothirty,2025-04-30T08:41:43,8

Didn't he say this like a week ago? Is it still 'news'?

Amazing how stupid people can be responsible for decision-making that can lead to the loss of American lives on the battlefield,2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-30T12:40:38,1
if trump listens to him then world war 3 with nukes will begin,saiyanscaris,2025-04-30T18:50:32,1

"not for me, I never believed in him. I thought his sweatshirt thing was cringe and even got downvoted for pointing it out here.  Feels good to see him become a total shitstain though, I feel vindicated.",Rich_Housing971,2025-04-30T07:57:40,18

I think we’d be much better off if we learned to avoid dissing people who do blue collar jobs. Fetterman can be a dumbass without it meaning he “should be a physical laborer.”,Cheshire_Khajiit,2025-04-30T10:07:43,2
Either that or he was always like this and just pretended to be normal to get elected. Either way he still sucks,No_big_whoop,2025-04-30T08:45:07,10
"All? When? A majority of his constituents voted for him, and I remember Reddit in general loving him because he wore casual clothing, wasn’t Dr Oz, ran next to a D (for some reason) and looked tough.",AndreasDasos,2025-04-30T08:15:57,5
Would've felt better to have been wrong about him I think.,TimArthurScifiWriter,2025-04-30T08:41:21,10

"Forgot about Reddit semantic Bikeshedding, I should amend to say ""most all of us knew"". I and many others have been commenting to this effect since he was elected. Many of us saw him coming. When he was elected, he was the lesser of two evils.",theombudsmen,2025-04-30T08:24:17,0
the guy is a actual case of brain damage in motion - after his health scare even he said the brain damage is making him into a facist/conservative/trumper,JimFknLahey,2025-04-30T08:20:10,8
"To pay devils advocat. ""Cooler heads"" means spending billions bombing poor people that are being manipulated as proxies. This will go on forever if the people causing it don't bleed.",JaVelin-X-,2025-04-30T08:31:01,0
"I’m not being pedantic. I just mean I’m not sure what ‘most of us’ means and how you know this. It seems a *huge* proportion of people from the left loved the guy, including a lot of people I know, relatively progressive media outlets, etc. Simply disagreeing or questioning that isn’t ‘bikeshedding’ over the world ‘all’, but have a good one!",AndreasDasos,2025-04-30T11:46:24,1
