"It won't and nobody thinks it will. It's an effort to empower conservative state legislatures to sell off the public school system to private corporations like private equity firms. It's class warfare, through and through.  Why? Republican ideology fundamentally does not accept the concept of public goods. In a very libertarian way they believe everything is best when privatized.   Largely because they are trying to implement Edmund Burke's ambition that ""an educated public is bad for business because people who can think for themselves will not be content to labor in factories for low wages,"" but families of the factory owners should be able to pay for their children to be the Supermen of society by getting an education.",GlobalGoldMan,2025-03-21T06:01:53,79

The premise of your question is wrong. States already have the authority over education in the state. The Department of Education does not dictate curriculum.  It provides funding for programs for disabled or low income. It collects data for research. It protects civil rights. It manages student loans for college. The money for low income and disabled will be made into block grants for the state to spend how they want. So now folks like Brent Farve can use that money to build volleyball courts instead of stealing from welfare.,MsAgentM,2025-03-21T06:45:08,13

The DOE was elevated to a Cabinet position in the late 1970's and Ronald Reagan tried to close it in his first term in 1982.    Among conservatives the DOE is largely viewed as a failure based on the amount of money spent.   It's existence also runs counter to the concept of Federalism.    So close it down and return more autonomy to the states along with the tax burden.  I don't believe Trump can shut it down anyways.,JKlerk,2025-03-21T06:36:58,3

"I think that the usual argument is that education is the responsibility of the States, as something not explicitly assigned to the Federal Government in the Constitution.

Despite having every advantage, like not having to pay taxes and local tax funding, they struggle to compete with private schools that manage to offer better salaries to teachers, better education, and still manage to crank out a profit. In a lot cases I don't think throwing money at educators is the solution- and I do believe states should step in to better police the financial management of their schools.

"Wow 6 hours in and not a lot of response for this one? It ultimately depends on what side of the political spectrum you are on. Personally speaking, I don't believe this to be true across the board.  My understanding from the right is that the reason they like it returning to the states is because:  1. Liberal Agenda - you know the argument, liberals are teaching my kids sex at this age and the LGBT community. We need some old fashion values teaching kinda types  2. There is a legitimate concern that a lot of kids are not reading at the proper level. I think this also goes with math as well. I think this is a very complex discussion, but on the right I think that they are in the mind that if they were more in charge then they can fix that  3. This one is more of an assumption and a continuation of #2. I know at one point they taught math differently. Common core right? I don't know if they are still doing that.

"So all of the rhetoric coming from the White House is misleading, probably intentionally so.  The Department of Education does not specify curriculums that schools are required to follow. The Department of Education provides resources that schools can leverage, but the majority of it's purpose is in dispersing federal funds to states that states can then use at their discretion to fund local schools. They also provide funding for colleges & universities and enable student loans and other financial aid packages for students that qualify, but these are also generally dispersed by the individual school or at the state level.  The vast majority of school curriculums are already determined at the state and local levels. Ending the DoE won't really change anything in that regard.  Ending the DoE is just licking the tip of those people who believe that ""schools are liberal indoctrination factories"" while also making it easier for states to divert funding to voucher programs that 100% benefit for-profit education systems. For-profit education systems like the one former Secretary of Education Betsy Devos's family runs. By removing the DoE there is no longer a centralized agency monitoring where funding goes, so it is easier for Trump's donors to funnel more of that money into their own pockets.  The goal is not to make education, and people who believe that probably failed kindergarten. The goal is to steal taxpayer dollars to make the oligarch class even more wealthy.",almightywhacko,2025-03-21T08:26:07,1

Schools cannot discriminate based on race, handicap, religious belief, etc. But the largest thing the department does is allocate funding to schools, about 10-14 percent of district funding.

Teachers already complain about not having basic supplies and all sending the regulations back to the states, especially poorer ones, is just going to exasperate this.

"The Federal education department takes federal tax income and redistributes it to states and school systems all over the country for specific programs, many of which are apparently needs-based, so that a poorer school district might have more programs being funded by the DoE. In addition the DoE tries to enforce federal laws regarding various civil rights of students as defined by congress.   Ending the DoE might, depending on how the details are handled, reduce the payments to poorer districts leading to an increase in the gap of spending per student in richer vs poorer areas. This arguably would not be good, but would prevent a 'transfer' of funds from richer to poorer districts, which is likely part of the 'real' reason for closing the DoE. A bonus will be reduced pesky meddling of federal officials in 'discriminatory' practices of local schools, allowing the local schools greater leeway in discriminating against poorer or disabled or minority students in various ways.  So the impact will be less oversight of discriminatory actions by local schools, and more money for richer school districts.

"It won't. The Federal government doesn't run public schools, set the curriculum or certify teachers, that's all done on the local and state level. If schools are failing that's on the states.  I think you can make a legitimate argument that because education is a fundamentally state function that there really isn't a need for the Dept of Education. The student loan program could be run by a different dept and the rest of the dept of education's budget could be returned to the states.   However, to do that without causing major disruptions will require a highly thought out and detailed plan. Even then it probably wouldn't go perfectly. Trump randomly taking a wrecking ball to the Dept of Education without any plan will only make everything worse. Keep in mind that most of the money the DoE gets (other than student loans) is funneled back down to local school districts through various programs and grants. Taking away all that money will mean that states will have education shortfalls in funding. That will mean higher local taxes or reduced overall funding for education.",Searching4Buddha,2025-03-21T11:04:39,1

Special needs students and lunch programs will be handed off to Health and Human Services under Mr."" I Don't Nelieve In Vaccines"". Other programs, such as Title 1 funding, will go elsewhere if they even survive.  Just so everyone is clear, the Ed. Dept. does not set circular, that is already being done at staye and local levels. What they do is set minimum standards that all states need to meet, so there is an even playing field and measurement status. Also, they grade states, districts, and universities, so we know how they stack up against one another. If this is left entirely to the states, you will have 50 different standards and structures.

"Reagan wanted to close the department of education too. The thinking centers around the Department of Education having had nearly 45 years and over a trillion dollars — and its track record is stagnant test scores, persistent inequality and a bloated bureaucracy that often creates more red tape than results.  Federal oversight was supposed to guarantee a floor for all kids. But one could argue it also built a ceiling — one-size-fits-all mandates, constant testing, and compliance-driven ‘accountability’ that has gutted teacher autonomy and squeezed out creativity. States and local communities, for all their flaws, are closer to the ground and theoretically understand what their students need — whether it’s bilingual ed in California or broadband in Appalachia. Returning power doesn’t have to mean abandoning equity. It could give real agency back to parents, teachers, and local leaders who are tired of Washington’s long-distance micromanagement.  That Is the counterpoints. Unfortunately, one need only look at Mississippi’s funding gap. Or at how long it took southern states to desegregate—after Brown v. Board. Or at how many disabled kids only got services because of federal law.

"I don't support the downsizing of the Department of Education being done without the approval of Congress, but it is a very wasteful, ineffective agency.  The Department of Education acts as a consultancy to school administrators and has encouraged the administrative bloat that threatens our schools.  Back in 1995, The Chicago Board of Education, had 3,300 employees, which was larger than the entire Japanese Ministry of Education (things have not improved since then). Japanese schools still somehow managed to *vastly* out-perform Chicago public schools.  Note: For anyone worried about school lunches, that's actually handled by the Department of Agriculture. Not saying DOGE won't come for them, too. Just saying it's a different agency.    >America’s public schools are bloated with bureaucracy and skinny on results.  Nationwide since 1950, the number of public school administrative and non-teaching positions has soared 702 percent while the student population increased just 96 percent. Over that same period, teachers’ numbers also increased — 252 percent — but still far short of administrators and non-teaching personnel (see chart above).  >Notably, that hiring trend has been just as prominent over the past two decades. From 1992 to 2009, students’ numbers increased 17 percent whereas administrators and other non-teaching staff rose 46 percent. And during that time, some states actually lost students yet kept hiring more non-teachers.  >Of course, those hiring patterns might be warranted if students’ academic gains kept pace. Academic outcomes, however, have not experienced similar growth. Public high school graduation rates peaked around 1970, and government data show reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) fell slightly between 1992 and 2008. Math scores on the NAEP Long-Term Trend were stagnant during the same period.  >Such irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars is indefensible. As state leaders continue to find ways to keep their fiscal houses in order, they shouldn’t fret that today’s economy is causing some to trim fat in public schools. It will serve teachers, students, and taxpayers well.  >For example, had non-teaching personnel increased at the same rate as students nationwide, American public schools would have an additional $24.3 billion annually— funds that could be used to give quality teachers raises, scholarships to students in need, relief to taxpayers, or some other worthy purpose.

"The attempt to dismantle the Department of Education isn’t about improving schools—it’s about gutting public education under the guise of “local control.” It’s a familiar political tactic: take a systemic issue like educational disparities and redirect the blame away from the real causes—decades of underfunding, union-busting, privatization schemes, and inequities between states—and instead blame the one institution trying to ensure a baseline of national standards. Conservatives manufacture the crisis by defunding public schools and weakening support structures, then use the existence of that crisis to argue the system should be torn down entirely.  When they call federal oversight “wasteful,” they’re oversimplifying the problem in a way that’s emotionally effective but intellectually dishonest. Public education isn’t failing because the Department of Education exists—it’s struggling because politicians at the state level have starved it of resources and then pointed at the struggling schools as evidence that government doesn’t work. It’s a deliberate strategy: set something up to fail, then use its failure to justify killing it.  This move is also part of a broader campaign to dismantle public institutions and replace them with for-profit alternatives. The push for “school choice” really means creating a two-tiered system—well-funded private and charter schools for the wealthy, underfunded public schools for everyone else. It’s not about empowering parents. It’s about removing protections, slashing funding, and opening the door to more privatization. If the goal were really to improve education, they’d invest in it.

The right wing also generally favors uneducated voters. Pretty much any stat will show you that there is a noticeable correlation between education level attained and tendency towards left wing policies (not _always_ but _generally_). College aged white women have something like a 50% disapproval rating of Trump where uneducated college males have something like 50% favorability towards Trump.

"If your child is a decent reader, OK at math, and generally doesn't struggle with school, eliminating the DOE won't impact them at all.  The DOE ensures that children with physical disabilities, learning impairments, language barriers, etc etc have equal access to education. That's the whole point of a public school: they take ALL students regardless of ability and socioeconomic status.  Without the DOE, some states will continue to ensure that all students are served, but many states (\*\*cough cough OKLAHOMA \*\*cough cough\*\*) simply wont. They will continue pushing vouchers for charter and private schools WHICH DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES or language barriers or anything else that might require expensive supports.  So IF public schools continue to exist, they will be dumping grounds filled with low achieving students with behavior problems whose parents can't navigate the system, children with learning disabilities that charters and private schools don't want to deal with, and children who don't speak English.  As enrollment in public schools decline, fewer and fewer high-quality, certified teachers with college degrees will choose education as their career (as well they should, it's already a shit show). Teachers at charters and private schools will be hourly wage workers without healthcare or retirement. They certainly wont be a political group that state legislatures are forced to battle with.  Education will become a for-profit enterprise in these Republican lead states. It's not profitable to educate your high-needs child.

The Department  of Education prevented that by maintaining and enforcing education standards, ones that all public schools were required to comply with.

"Because the department of educations main purpose was to hand out loans and grants for students. Not dictate what goes on in schools day to day. This is where the crazy dei and trans policies were allowed to be in our schools, just let kids be kids. As for college, I can tell you from first hand experience going back to school in my 30s that there is no tolerance for anyone who doesn’t agree with DEI or left leaning politics. I took a sociology class that literally told all of us that only white people can be racist. That just isn’t true, and it’s a big reason DEI is more dividing than uniting. It’s DEI that decided self segregation was a good idea. Black only dorms, DEI lounges that don’t allow white students it (real inclusive), and black only graduations. DEI doesn’t teach people that we’re all equal. It teaches minorities to view everyone that doesn’t look like them as racist and they have no way to advance their lives because the system keeps them from achieving their goals. All of which isn’t true in the slightest. I mean it is a brilliant strategy by the left, if you can’t be overtly racist, just convince the minorities everyone hates you and don’t trust anyone that doesn’t look like you, because even before getting to know them you just assume they don’t like you. How is that diversity, equity, or inclusion. I stand with Morgan freeman. The only way to get rid of racism is to STOP MAKING IT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOU!

The DOE spends around $3B a year in salaries and expenses that conservatives see as a waste. You can argue either way on that opinion because there is no universal agreement on what is and isn’t wasteful.   I personally don’t know enough to say how effective the DOE is as an organization but I’m inclined to oppose the Trump administration due to its proven track record of lies and self serving motives. ",User28645,2025-03-21T12:44:45,1

More importantly, as someone who has been strongly against worshiping at the altar of assessment (as a professor I know once put it) in education policy, the idea that you need to get rid of the Department of Education in order to move us to a non-NCLB like model is perhaps the best example I've ever heard of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The Department of Education existed before NCLB, and if you want to make education in America better what should follow is changing policy rather than demolishing the department.  If you want a clear perspective on what this administration is after by demolishing the DoEd, this [Brookings Institute recap of Project 2025 and education](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-and-education-a-lot-of-bad-ideas-some-more-actionable-than-others/) is a good primer.

"In another comment, you've already admitted you’ve wanted to eliminate the Department of Education for 30 years—so let’s not pretend this is a good-faith response to current outcomes. This isn’t about fixing education. It’s about pushing a decades-long ideological goal to shrink public institutions, no matter the consequences.  Whether it’s 10% or not, that federal contribution carries legal teeth. Title I, IDEA, Title IX—those programs don’t just appear out of thin air. They're tied to federal oversight and conditions that ensure civil rights, equity, and accountability. And no, states don’t reliably fund these things on their own—that’s why federal enforcement exists. The history is crystal clear: without a national floor, marginalized students get left behind.  Calling the DOE a ""pass-through"" is a deliberate oversimplification. It’s not just a mailbox for funds—it sets standards, enforces compliance, and ensures federal protections aren't optional. Dismantling it doesn’t just shift power to the states; it removes protections for the students most at risk of being ignored, underfunded, or actively discriminated against.  So let’s be clear—this isn’t some neutral budget trim. It’s a calculated move to weaken public education, remove federal guardrails, and open the door to privatization.

"Test scores are kind of moot anyway. Some kids are really good at taking tests, but really horrible at focusing on things like class work and homework. While other kids try very hard in class and at home, they just struggle with test taking. When I was in high school, I would skip classes for weeks at a time, show up and take the test, and then score higher than 99% of the class who showed up every day. Those kids probably understood the principles of what was being taught much better than I did. I was just really good at test taking. Classes that put more weight on test scores and very little weight on class work and homework, I would ace. But any class where most of your grade came from homework and attendance/class work, I would fail.   I also moved states kind of frequently as a child. In Phoenix, AZ in elementary school, I was in gifted classes and the school suggested I skip 4th grade (my mom said no because she was worried that being in class with older kids would result in them picking on me). In 6th grade, we briefly moved to Las Vegas, where 6th grade was middle school instead of elementary school. I struggled with that change and even the adults at the school were kind of snooty — I was the rare poor kid at this school. My mom didn’t even make me go to school for the 3 months we were in Las Vegas because they were so shitty there. We moved back to Pittsburgh where I was born and you’d think they would have failed me for 6th grade because I missed 3-4 whole months of school, but the curriculum in Pittsburgh was so far behind even the regular classes in Phoenix that they still pushed me through. But even without my own testimonial from the early 2000s, take one look at Florida and you can see that there is no national standardized curriculum in K-12 schools.

Nvm the Constitutional question of whether Trump can actually close the DOE.      Cutting federal programs for tax cuts is generally a fine proposition.

"Yeah, pretty much any news outlet that promotes editorial content as news is not a reliable source. There are some great books by Doris Graber on the subject of media and it's role in politics. It goes back beyond the last 15 years but has definitely gotten worse this century. 24 hour news or internet talking heads are less intended to inform than make money by hyper-sensationalizing stories to get an emotional reaction and keep viewers in a state of anxiety so they stay tuned in. It has caused brain rot in our society. I also wouldn't call it ""fake news"" as much as I would call it ""spin news"".   I've also had the pleasure to work in school library and digital resource software for 20 plus years. In this role I've visited rural, suburban and urban schools (public and private) throughout the country (in both red and blue states) as well as a handful of international schools. I've spent thousands of hours in rooms with many a librarian and curriculum director to talk about the main problems they face in order to help them best utilize the systems we offered. It's of note that I wasn't the sales person, but post sales support, training and adoption management. I have eaten lunch in the lunchroom at hundreds of schools of every variety. There is already a frightening and tragic disparity in the level of education students in rural areas have access to. At those schools, the primary goal might be to teach them how not to become a teenage parent, or give them the minimal skills to be able to get through vocational school to learn a trade once they do. These are the schools struggling to provide a decent daily meal to the children of their community. Without federal funding, many of these children will be lost. I can also say that all the hype about how students don't say the pledge or that teachers push a liberal agenda on kids is flat out wrong. I have never seen this in even one public school. However, I have seen very expensive private schools that have extremely strong diversity curriculums. Because the rich people understand that to be competitive in a global market, requires a cosmopolitan view point and critical thinking only comes with studying and discussing different viewpoints.

"You say part of fixing education is eliminating the federal role—but that’s not a fix, that’s a retreat. You’re assuming that civil rights, equity, and accountability will magically be preserved at the state level, even though history repeatedly shows that without federal oversight, states fail to protect the most vulnerable students. That's not hypothetical—it’s documented fact. Title I exists because poor districts were being left behind. IDEA exists because states were excluding students with disabilities. Title IX exists because gender discrimination was rampant—and still is.  Saying “you can enforce those concepts through other federal organizations” while simultaneously advocating for the removal of the one agency tasked with doing exactly that is like saying, “we don’t need fire departments, someone else can handle fires.” It's not a serious argument—it's an ideological preference masquerading as policy.  Calling the DOE unnecessary while offering no structural replacement for how those rights, funds, and standards will be maintained is what gives away the game. You frame the DOE as part of the problem, but never show how removing it improves anything. In fact, you admit the “oversimplification” of your earlier claim, then shrug it off. But if you're trying to overhaul an entire national system, oversimplification isn't a minor flaw—it’s reckless.  As for privatization—there’s a well-documented, decades-long conservative effort to undermine and defund public education in favor of charter schools and voucher systems. Major Republican donors and think tanks have pushed this agenda for years. If you're unaware of that, you're ignoring the political context that makes this move not just symbolic, but strategic.  You can say “this isn't about weakening public education” all you want—but when the first move is to eliminate the only agency tasked with protecting equity and civil rights across 50 wildly unequal state systems, the effect is the same. If you tear out the guardrails and say ""don’t worry, the states will do the right thing,"" that's not reform. It's faith-based policymaking at best—or willful neglect at worst.  AND despite all this, you still haven’t explained how the Department of Education is actually making education worse. You’ve made clear you oppose it on principle, but not once have you shown any policy, action, or outcome where the DOE has directly harmed students or schools. If you’re arguing to dismantle a national institution, that should be the starting point—not an assumption. Until you can do that, this isn’t a serious policy discussion—it’s just ideology looking for justification.",eddyboomtron,2025-03-21T12:23:03,2

"The “per pupil cost” (“PPC”) prices in the cost to educate ALL the children in a given district is an average.  The voucher is meant for students to take their PPC with them whenever they like.   However, Special Ed kids cost a lot more to educate than traditional-track kids.  Kids who need additional individual Ed plans under the IDEA act, require more resources to plan for and implement those plans than kids who don’t need those plans.  This includes kids that, for instance, are too young to give themselves daily medication or insulin.   Public schools are required by federal law to implement those plans for those kids.   If the PPC voucher is, say 7000.  A typical learner may only cost $3000 to educate, while a special needs learner or disabled student might cost $12,000 to educate.  If the $7000 travels with a typical-learner to a private school, the public school has to make up the shortfall somewhere and they can’t, unless the state pitches in even more money to the public school to make up for the loss from the voucher.  Private schools are not required to take special learners, or to accommodate students under the IDEA act (come up with IEPs etc).  Without those accommodations, special learners are more likely to fail (that’s why they’re special learners).  This means that kids with more needs will, over time, be a larger proportion of the public schools, so the overall PPC for those schools has now gone up at the same time the typical learners (who only cost $3000 to educate) are leaving with their $7000 vouchers.   Meanwhile, studies show that typically the private schools raise their tuition by about the amount of the voucher anyway, so no parents are really saving money, but the private schools are raking it in.",Bugbear259,2025-03-21T16:41:03,2

"Regurgitating media talking points??? Did you read some of your own responses? YOU are on the accelerationists side. YOU are on the side of bigots and neo nazis. YOU are afraid of blue haired people. YOUR fear is being manipulated by YOUR media choices; read one of your responses a few lines up: “Guns. Trans. Hunter Biden. Ukraine. Etc. Etc. Etc”. Project all you want, it’s one of your only defense mechanisms left at this point.   Not all media is “owned”, btw. That’s another lie you’ve been spoon fed to keep you stuck on Fox and newsmax: “we’re all owned by someone”. Demonstrably untrue. Figure it out if you’re serious about it.   Yes, democrats at the top suck too. They are in the pockets of a lot of the same lobbyists that the republicans are. The difference is that a big portion of the people on the left care about truth and we still have decent grass roots politicians. It’s why CNN and MSNBC (and others) can only really suck in the sense that they are sensationalist and biased. Too many folks on the left would never put up with what folks on the right do when it comes to the information they consume. I’m done here tho. I won’t change you or your mind. That’s your choice.",Anti_rabbit_carrot,2025-03-21T18:57:31,10
"I hope you continue to have these discussions and begin considering the things you’ve been told to be afraid of. The majority of the left does not want the extreme things you’re told. We want equity and fairness… for everyone. That includes people we don’t agree with. Your news sources are giving messaging that makes people want to destroy us. All through lies, propaganda and disinformation.   Alternative Press and Reuters. Those are great sources for information. Every human being will make mistakes, including journalists. Always check to be sure what you’re reading is true and if it’s something new in the news cycle, understand all the facts may not be presented yet, or could even be wrong.",Anti_rabbit_carrot,2025-03-21T19:22:26,6

Which means the money is a waste,JKlerk,2025-03-23T12:40:44,1
"(1) When this EO was signed, during the press briefing, it was specifically stated that Congress would be required to legislate the abolishment of the DOE. (2) “respect the rule of law, know the bounds of authority.”  Believe it or not, that is still true, …and a sarcastic troll.  May not be true 3 weeks from now, we don’t know. The legality of these actions will end up at in front of the Supreme Court, as expected, anyway.  And likely, a ruling governing these rogue judges on jurisdiction and scope. (3) You have no idea what sources of news, etc use.   Fox News?  Haven’t watched it in YEARS - cut cable/satellite like 7-8+ yrs.  That does seem to be the go-to, common accusation, to those not partaking of the Kool Aid (& yes, I acknowledge Kool Aid is enjoyed by some on both sides).  I, though, do not & I’d give the benefit of doubt to you, too. You can jump to whatever conclusion you want. (4) It’s wise to not so boldly make assumptions as to just what another person believes, thinks, does, or acts.  Because, you have a 50% chance of being wrong.",WATGGU,2025-03-24T17:15:06,2
Isn't all medication at school the purview of the school nurse?  How is that connected to special ed?,haze_from_deadlock,2025-03-21T17:56:03,1
You're downvoting every comment of mine.  You sent me a pdf.  I pointed out that the second sentence of YOUR pdf supports my point.  How is that disengaged?,callmejay,2025-03-23T12:16:47,0
"It’s about whether a school can (or is even required to) accommodate a child’s needs or not.  Public schools cant afford full time school nurses, much less more than one.  If a nurse is out sick who can accommodate the child’s medication administration ?   Public schools are required to make an education available to everyone but they simply can’t afford to as voucher money keeps flowing to private schools.  That voucher money includes money for overhead - like school nurses.  Private schools are not under an obligation to educate disabled children at all.  They must make accommodations for the public (such as handicap spots for visitors) but they are not required to make accommodations for any one child who is privately enrolled.  I haven’t explained it well here.  But the ADA basically doesn’t apply to private memberships except in some narrow circumstances.  Certainly private schools are not required to develop or implement IEPs or follow the IDEA act.",Bugbear259,2025-03-21T20:44:15,1
"You said they don’t fine - they do. Then you said they only fine states; they don’t. Now you’re talking about a sentence that says they fine schools.  Suffice it to say, any position you take that says there is no enforcement action happening isn’t legitimate. The fed giving itself the authority also isn’t legitimate. You haven’t yet shown me where states have given the DOE authority over themselves or where the constitution grants it.  So we are back to the beginning- the fed overreach and its infringement on a basic check and balance that our founders insisted on.  I posted links that show every comment you are was not true - you haven’t yet talked about the DOE not having any bonafide role.",RCA2CE,2025-03-23T12:23:49,1
"Over half of Illinois (my home state) schools don't have a nurse, but Illinois also doesn't have any voucher program whatsoever, and Democrats have had full control of the Illinois state legislature since 2005.   They could raise state taxes to pay for school nurses and that sounds like a good idea.   Nurses can probably earn much higher salaries in hospitals and clinics. The issue is clearly more complicated than just vouchers.",haze_from_deadlock,2025-03-22T14:25:46,1
"They are GIVING MONEY to states and colleges in exchange for an agreement to follow certain rules.  If those rules aren't followed, they can ""fine"" them but they're basically taking their own money back.  Any state (and I think any college?) can decline the whole deal already and be exactly in the same place as they would be if DOE were done away with.  The reason they don't do that is because DOE is a net benefit for them.",callmejay,2025-03-23T12:30:42,1
"They’re giving our money to them and fining them if they don’t follow rules they don’t have authority to create or enforce. Your statement makes it seem like this is some donation, it’s tax money collected and being held hostage unless federal rules are followed. Again, we are still at this place - the DOE has no authority to do this.",RCA2CE,2025-03-23T13:27:01,2
"What do you mean exactly they have no authority to do this?  There's a [ream of law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20) where Congress explicitly gives them that authority.  If you're trying to say it's unconstitutional, well, it's held up in courts so far for 60 years, but I'm certainly no constitutional lawyer.  You keep ignoring my main point, though, which is that (1) states are 100% free already to opt out, and they are choosing not to and (2) that even if they could opt out of both the ED and the taxes that support ED, they (red states) would then be much worse off, because blue state money is basically being funneled to them through ED.",callmejay,2025-03-23T19:06:58,1
