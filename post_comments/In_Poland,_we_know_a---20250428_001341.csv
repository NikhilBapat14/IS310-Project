From an outsider position it looks as if there was almost no resistance in the US against the rise of facism right now. It's like 'Is there nobody fighting back?!'   I don't know how it looks from the inside -  but I think creating visibility for any counter movement will be crucial.,delayedTermination,2025-04-28T01:03:15,5

"The title itself shows that while Poland has experience they are certainly not to be emulated or held up as a shining example. Liberalism is not the pinnacle of society, it is a stepping stone to conservatism. It is an attempt to hold a middle ground where no middle ground exists.",TheVaneja,2025-04-28T02:02:44,-3
"In Poland, we've got experience dealing with illiberal regimes. Here's our advice for the Trump era. Let's stay strong and united against threats to democracy. Let's learn from history and stand up for our values. Together, we can make a difference.",Old_Position_8961,2025-04-28T00:57:10,9

Not enough people care and they won't until it starts affecting them personally. Things are going to have to get much much worse here before people wake the fuck up and actually do something about the things that are going on.,Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-28T08:03:41,1

"So even though there's some overlap, there's a difference between liberal ideology and a liberal democracy. Someone could theoretically hold conservative ideals and still promote the tenets of liberal democracy.",fuckishouldntcare,2025-04-28T02:23:22,6
"WTF man, are you seriously saying that it's bad if somebody wants to fight for democracy if they don't lean left enough? Also, the views called liberal in Europe would likely qualify as very left leaning in the USA and still quite left leaning in Canada, looks like you need to educate yourself quite a bit on European politics.",hsiale,2025-04-28T06:31:39,1

"Unfortunately the cost of living being what it is, and tenant protections having been stripped away bit by bit, most of us are trying desperately to hold on to our jobs or having to work two full time jobs just to keep afloat. If most of us that want to protest were to actually go protest like we need to, we would be homeless in a matter of weeks.   I am doing what I can to help resist, I’m offering free self defense and shooting classes in my limited free time, and educating people close to me in asymmetrical warfare, and trying to build networks in case things get nastier than they already are.   It’s a steamroll at this point, and it’s only a matter of time. I don’t want this, voted against it along with everyone else I know. We’re all just along for the ride at this point.",SgtHelo,2025-04-28T09:34:21,4

"Also, DC is Very Far Away and inconveniently expensive for people to go and protest in person. People across the nation have been holding protests at state capitols and smaller rallies away from those cities. Even the smallish town where I live (pop 77K) has seen several hundred people out on weekends waving signs & making their voices heard. Town halls in this state are beginning to erupt between supporters & former supporters of POTUS.  So, it’s not great. But it’s definitely not terrible. We have a long way to go but I’m confident the momentum is picking up, largely due to the administration’s own ineptitude and proclivity for ignoring our basic rights.",Spam_A_Lottamus,2025-04-28T14:17:49,2

"Prepared..  Fair enough givin the atmosphere. But a good thing to add would be to sensibilize people that, in fact, we're all in the same boat, must be united and standing strongly together and to finally open our eyes:  the true enemy is in fact the pluto/crato/oli/klepto -anything you want- cracy.",BahutF1,2025-04-28T13:10:15,3

">Also, DC is Very Far Away and inconveniently expensive for people to go and protest in person.  If it's important to people, they'll find a way there.
