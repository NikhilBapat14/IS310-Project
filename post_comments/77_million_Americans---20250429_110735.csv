"I don't think it's devastating at all, it depends on the question you ask.  Trumpism (which has eaten the entire GOP by this point) isn't a political position, it's a religion.   If you ask a religious person if they agree that child cancer and malaria and famine are good, they'll say ""No of course not"".  But you cannot misinterpret  ""26% of followers disapprove of God's creating cancer and malaria and allowing famine"" as ""26% of followers regret choosing this God.""   They don't, really, because that's not an option.  It's just not how devotional faiths work.     If you ask a Trump supporter (who - again - is nearly all Republicans at this point) to defend tariffs and disappearing people and proposed military crackdowns, they're just going to say that they honestly don't know - it seems bad but they don't understand it.  He works in mysterious ways, but they trust the president and his plan.  Even if they didn't, who's the alternative?  _Satan_?    So yeah, if you sent them back in time to the election to do it over again, 98% of them would vote for him again even knowing it'll be a disaster.  The other 2%?

"Voters are stickier than you think. It's quite difficult getting voters to accept that they made a mistake - the human ego is almost as resilient as a substance addiction.

Unlike most people here, I actually know Trump supporters. The ones I know are disappointed at what Trump has been doing. Would they vote for him again? They're not sure. Sadly, voting Democrat is out of the question for almost all of them.  \> 98% of them would vote for him again even knowing it'll be a disaster.  It's only been 100 days. Give it time.
