"I was just down in Cape May NJ which is part of the red part of NJ. Sitting at a brewery, when no one else was around a bartender casually brought up how this was affecting them, Canadians love Cape May. She said people around her refuse to see this and dismiss her entirely so she is careful who bring it up around.",thegoodnamesrgone123,2025-04-26T10:04:26,20

I only wonder why it hasnt dropped more. One can only hope that it drops even further when people realize that this is the new normal in the states. So many other places to visit and you won't even risk getting rerouted to an ice facility,StrikingAnxiety5527,2025-04-26T11:16:08,9

"Snippets:  >“You’re looking at substantial losses this year, about a $10bn loss this year in international travel spending relative to last year,” Sacks said.  >“It comes down to the basic principle that we’ve seen over decades, which is that travelers can go wherever they want, whenever they want. So antipathy towards a destination will have noticeable effects. It’s highly elastic to those sorts of external factors, and then you add to that the high-profile detainments which got a lot of press, particularly in Europe.”  >“The way we are perceived globally is we are blowing up not just our economy but everyone else’s economy,” Jackie Filla, president of the Hotel Association of Los Angeles, told [the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-12/will-trumps-tariffs-affect-californias-tourism-industry).",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-26T09:38:16,9

"We have international offices that would consolidate here in the US 3-4 times a year for enormous conferences. Each one of those events was outright cancelled by the end of January. None, and I mean none of my international colleagues, whether it was European or Asian or African or even Canadian felt safe or comfortable coming into the US. Sure it saved my companies tens if not hundreds of thousands in T & E budget (not like it matters to me, not like my company will give us anymore of a bonus out of the savings). But that's also that much revenue not going to our customer resorts and entertainment in Las Vegas, Miami, Denver, Seattle, New York or MSP. It has Maine downstream effects that industries are going to start really feeling once they see their Q1 earnings a fraction of what they were.",J-the-Kidder,2025-04-26T10:54:56,7

"And many of those trips were planned months in advance. The country that sends the largest number of tourists to the U.S. is Canada and I doubt that many Canadians are looking to spend their summer vacations here.

Boycott Florida.,lostsailorlivefree,2025-04-26T15:02:06,3
This whole tariff thing is an obvious smokescreen to steal headlines while he and his minions continue to openly defy the Supreme Court and arrest sitting judges.   Trump is nothing but a traitor working under the direction of foreign interests to dismantle America. Once you look at all of his actions from that perspective nothing is confusing at all. He is boiling the frog.,Ba-Na-Na-s,2025-04-26T09:50:29,6

They’ll start saying America is for Americans.  Does Florida really think they’ll survive without the only thing that makes them money?  More blue state handouts for them I guess,Red_Wing-GrimThug,2025-04-26T16:58:59,1
"Rookie numbers. Wait till the summer.  I’m in the US and even I’m not traveling here. I usually spend the whole summer road-tripping.  I live in a blue state now but I spend tens of thousands of dollars going to the beach, New Orleans and visiting family and friends all over Louisiana and Texas.  You couldn’t drag me to a red state right now.  I’ll be spending my time and money on local events.

"There’s other aspects to this as well. Canadian snowbirds are fucking up some real estate markets by divesting their summer homes, and everyone I personally know who vacationed in the U.S for 5-6 months out of the year have no intention on ever setting foot on American soil again. I live in a border city, and Michigan is a 2 minute car ride away.

"Unfortunately, I think it's simpler than that. Trump sees no difference between himself and the state. It's all about him. He wants other countries to come to him on their knees and offer him something that benefits him personally, either money in his pocket or something he can sell as a victory to his cultists. Remember, the SCOTUS already ruled he can't be prosecuted for official acts, so there's really nothing he can't get away with.",gigashark0,2025-04-26T10:08:55,8
