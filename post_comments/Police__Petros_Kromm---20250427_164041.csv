something tells me maga might be involved considering the guys a democrat,saiyanscaris,2025-04-27T16:47:55,24
That's not good. There's a non-zero chance he was kidnapped and killed by a MAGA in order to silence him as opposition.,LordSiravant,2025-04-27T17:06:55,14
He absolutely drowned imo. Stop with the divisiveness.¬†,AmbitiousBat6235,2025-04-28T17:19:06,2
The timing of this is crazy to me with everything going on a NUMC . Did he have any connection to matt bruderman ?¬†,Independent_Gas1643,2025-04-28T07:31:39,1
"The fact he has a very Greek name, I'd wager that ICE wouldn't know the difference and figured he was Latino and sent him to Equador",Derwurld,2025-04-27T18:33:26,19
"I grew up in the area.   He was last seen in Baldwin, and is located in Long Beach.    Both tend to be more blue areas, depending on the part of the town (like north Baldwin is more blue than Baldwin harbor).  That being said Baldwin is within 5 minutes of Merrick, which is one of the towns that held a counter protest to the BLM protests.   It is also (for Baldwin and Long Beach) an area with lots of minorities.  The Merrick/Bellmore area tends to be more white.   Hopefully he is okay and found alive and well.  Edit to add: him getting abducted or killed isn't outside the realm of possibilities.  There is a high population density in the area and while I wouldn't consider it particularly unsafe people have been murdered before.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-27T17:45:11,8

"I feel like it‚Äôs way more likely he drown. Police found his ID at the beach, his fam said he was in great shape, training for a triathlon, and very comfortable with cold water training.   A swim alone might have done him in",randoreds,2025-04-28T14:52:12,2
Lol merrick never held an anti blm protest ! Stop with lies,Independent_Gas1643,2025-04-28T07:30:19,0
"There absolutely was.  Not a lie.   You can read about it [here](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/06/blm-merrick-long-island-protest-history.html)  But there absolutely was a counter protest in Merrick.    As I said I am from the area (grew up in Freeport, went to highschool in Baldwin) so I keep up with the news from the area.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-28T07:37:02,3
