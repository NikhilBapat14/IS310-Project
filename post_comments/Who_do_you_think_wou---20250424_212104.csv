"The issue was that the elite top tier candidates didn't want to go in half assed with no team or national network. They want to spend 3 years building a 50 state campaign, not 2 weeks. They wouldn't have joined a primary for that reason.    This along with the campaign war chest the Biden/Harris campaign already had, were why Harris was the only choice.  She had a campaign staff in every state and access to tens of millions of dollars already. ",_SCHULTZY_,2025-04-25T03:47:04,655
"Obama didn't lobby for a primary. Obama lobbied for an open convention. A primary is a state by state run process that involves all voters who choose to participate. An open convention enables assigned Democratic delegates to hold a floor vote for the candidate of their choice.   Obama's motivations for an open primary have never been stated publicly. The OP suggests Obama didn't want Harris to be the nominee but that is known. Some insiders claim Obama lobbied for an open convention so the process would appear more inclusive and fair. That just giving it to Harris would make some portions of the coalition feel disenfranchised. There are more considerations than merely liking or disliking a candidate.   Ultimately I have yet to hear a single creditable insider name any Democrat of stature that was prepared to challenge Harris. No one has leaked that Newsom, Whitmer, Shapiro, Buttigeig, Booker, Polis, etc was ready to step up had there been an open convention. In the absence of any alternative I don't think it reasonably could have been anyone other than Harris.",8to24,2025-04-25T07:13:18,162
"Honestly, I think they knew the campaign was doomed from the beginning. Pretty sure a last minute switch like that, a month before the convention, has never happened before. It was uncharted waters for the entire party, and sadly it backfired.   The only other dem who was still publicly considering challenging Kamala, post endorsement, was Joe Manchin. So the other household names most likely decided on 2028 for a proper run after JB endorsed KH immediately.",Slight_Writer_6715,2025-04-25T08:10:33,13

"I think Kamala still would have won. The most reliable democratic constituency are black women, and they were paying *very* close attention to whether or not she'd be passed over when Biden stepped down. I think she would've won South Carolina, and like her immediate predecessors -- Biden, Hillary, Obama -- it would've made her a lock for the nomination.  And, I think, if Kamala had time to organically build a coalition, rather than trying to rapidly adopt Biden's, she'd have performed better in the general election. I'm not going to say she'll have won, but she'd have had a better chance of winning.

There couldn’t have been a primary that short and it would have been a disaster. The money couldn’t have been used. The mistake was to make Biden a temp down. He did a lousy debate. He could have rebounded and talked trash about Trump and did town halls if he refused to debate again. Then step down after a year. Or else he decided in Dec. 2023 not to run again.

"The DNC didn't have the stomach for primaries again. Ever since Bernie started using the primaries as his chance every four years to force the DNC to adopt more progressive platform positions, the center-left had had enough of him, and of Elizabeth Warren too. The entrenched center-left have a deep distaste for populism, it's an existential threat to their control of the party. (I say this as a center-left Dem who basically 100% agrees with Hillary Clinton on pretty much every foreign and domestic policy issue, save for my stance on the viability of single-payer).   Anyway, it's pretty obvious (to me, at least) that Biden either deliberately or sub-consciously delayed his decision to not run again to do an end-around on the primaries.   There should have been a brokered convention. The fact that within the first hour of Biden's announcement, Harris had already received very public endorsements form central party figures in order to control the narrative is the most damning aspect of the whole sordid affair. We should all hate them for it. Harris could have won the election IF she had even the veneer of having base party support. But she would NEVER have won an open primary (you're smoking crack if you think so - she's a dreadful campaigner who occasionally gets lucky with a viral line or two). It would have been the Bernie/Warren show for the populist socialist votes, and Booker/Buttigieg/Klobuchar/Harris battling it out for the lifer Democrats. Same as 2020. No one in the DNC or the party wanted that, and they yet again underestimated Trump.   Thanks a lot, you arrogant bastards.",mehughes124,2025-04-25T21:41:55,2

If Clyburn had listened to his grandson who was working on Buttigieg's campaign, we might be looking at Mayor Pete's second term.   But there's a false assumption here: Harris' candidacy wasn't doomed by the lack of a primary. She was well ahead in the polls as soon as she was the DNC choice. After the debate, she was a shoo-in. Then came the women-got-this mentality, that women were going to bring it home and we didn't need anyone else. That killed us. Tim Walls very friendly good-dog debate with Vance didn't help a bit. Harris dropped like a rock.    A primary, on the other hand, would have driven all the candidates to positions left of the electorate and the GOP would have had all the ammunition they needed. One of Harris' advantages was that all her far left positions were four years old.

" Andy Beshear.  www.instagram.com/reel/CzXozlAuuqi/  I think Beshear out of everyone mentioned here. He's done a lot of good for Kentuckians, won 3 statewide elections in KY where Trump won in a landside. A term as AG & 2 gubernatorial races (he's term limited to 2)  He's like a progressive that acts like a moderate liberal. He's the most popular Dem governor & second overall according to some polling I read about earlier this month. He expanded Medicaid to cover more dental, vision & hearing, legalized medical marijuana, vetoed an anti-trans bill, fought against public funding going to private schools (his Lt. Governor used to be a teacher) successfully. Unions love him, Shawn Fein, UAW president said Beshear was the top name workers wanted as Kamala's running mate. He's openly Christian & talks about his faith, but doesn't use it to be hateful or as a prop, imo.   I follow news about him pretty closely, I volunteered for both of his gubernatorial campaigns but haven't heard what his stance is on Gaza, so hopefully he's not pro IDF.  I'm super progressive, the only other campaigns I've ever volunteered for were Bernie's & I love Beshear. My mom is more moderate & loves him too, she never lived in KY but she watches when he's interviewed MSNBC. still have friends in Kentucky that don't follow politics & don't even regularly vote (I know, I know) but they'd turn out for him.

Kamala Harris, happy warrior was replaced with, ""Donald Trump is an existential threat to democracy."" I can't tell you how much that shift stressed me out at the time. She might've still lost had she stayed the course, but I think she'd have had a better shot.  Now, to answer your question, there were like 100 days in which nominate and run a candidate.

"It depends.  If they held their word about Biden being a transitionary president, this would've allowed for full primaries. Right now AOC, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris are the betting favorites for 2028, I'd imagine they'd still be the top three, and to date, AOC has the best odds out of all of them. The other two were more closely intertwined with the Biden administration and represented the status quo in many ways. (I think AOC would've needed to build more cache with rural voters to win any states in the GE outside of New England/NY and California, but if she had a full 2-3 years to promote a real economic plan, who knows).   If they tried to hold a primary after Biden stepped down, Harris was winning pretty easily. She had a huge advantage in name recognition, and voters value that over the nuances in policy differences between candidates of the same party. I think it goes slightly better for her in this scenario because she wouldn't have the criticism of being undemocratically appointed, but I think she still loses the GE either way.  As things stand, I think the democrats have good odds in 2028 because republicans will have a hard time coalescing around a nominee with issues like age and rule of law likely to rear their head.

"> The issue was that the elite top tier candidates didn't want to go in half assed with no team or national network.  This is exactly it, and what people don't seem to get. Nobody seems to remember that the campaign was basically collapsing at that point. It was radioactive. Anybody with *serious* Presidential ambitions and already possessing national name recognition would've sat it out - it would've effectively been career suicide to attach your name to the campaign at that point.  Likely what you would've had is a bunch of unknowns coming out of the woodwork to make a name for themselves at a couple of primary debates by attacking the only serious candidate, which would've been Harris. Harris would've still ended up winning the nomination, but significantly weakened by spending 4-6 weeks being attacked by her own party. And then the actual campaign would've been even shorter than it was.  Sure, maybe it's possible that some incredible candidate would've emerged and swept the floor, but it's more likely than not that Harris would've ended up the nomination and Democrats would've done even worse in 2024.

Maybe her campaign weaknesses make her stumble, especially in a longer primary, but I think in a quick one she still wins.

"Technically, the convention was open still - but effectively became moot because there was no creditable challenger (or really any challenger at all) who put their name forward to challenge.   Harris didn't automatically inherit Biden's delegates. That's why there was a gap still between Harris officially putting herself forward as the candidate and even the confirmation that she had enough delegates to win the nomination. Her team still had to reach out to those delegates and get confirmation that they would also vote for her but they were officially released.   Obviously, especially given no challengers and that they were Biden pledged delegates and she was the Biden endorsed candidate, it wasn't a massive uphill battle.   But theoretically, even as it played out, if any other candidate had declared intention to run and lobbied for those delegates, and somehow managed to convince a large enough share before the virtual delegate vote that Harris lost the majority needed, it would have been a contested convention.",PhiloPhocion,2025-04-25T11:47:31,20

Only having to beat Kamala and maybe one or two others would have been irresistible. I doubt Pritzker and Shapiro would have let such a rare opportunity pass them by.  Kamala was never going to win..the evidence was overwhelming imo. Her abysmal showing in the 2020 primary, one of the most unpopular VP's ever, inept off script, weak on policy, low on credibility with the way she insisted Biden was a mental giant, weak on the border, vulnerable on trans issues, and above all she polled the absolute worst head to head vs Trump compared to the rest. Only a single poll had her ahead by a pt, the rest were 50/50 or worse when she was nominated. In contrast, the likes of Kelly, Shapiro, Whitmer all consistently beat Trump head to head with  Whitmer in particular obliterating him by wide margins. In what universe does it make sense to pick the one with the worst odds of winning? ​  I'd like to believe that a convention would've been able to fulfill its intended purpose and produced the best possible candidate not named Kamala Harris but if past history predicts future behavior, Murphys law would have all but guaranteed that we would've still somehow ended up with her",nexxwav,2025-04-25T12:33:02,-5

"You do realize this was Trump’s strategy all along, right? There are literal video clips of him at Mar-a-Lago bragging about how the goal was to undermine Biden’s mental fitness — not through facts, but through repetition. They started pushing the “dementia” narrative the day he took office despite no medical evidence. It was designed to create doubt over time, not prove anything (Haberman, 2023; Montanaro, 2024).  This was a long game of delegitimization — similar to the “birther” strategy used against Obama. You repeat something outrageous until it feels like “where there’s smoke, there must be fire.” It was never about truth — it was about eroding trust slowly, so when the moment came (Biden stepping aside), the groundwork had already been laid to paint any replacement as weak or illegitimate.  The GOP’s messaging ecosystem — significantly amplified by outlets like Fox News, Newsmax, and influencers on social media — kept that “dementia” narrative alive for years. Media researchers have shown this is a common tactic in political propaganda: repeat an unproven claim until it becomes a vibe (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008).  So yeah, it wasn’t just a lucky break for Trump. It was baked into the plan — a strategic destabilization of public confidence in Democratic leadership, no matter who stepped up. The debate was the lucky break, but many people already wanted him pulled. Look at the State of the Union. Biden was solid, but it must be all the drugs they got him on. He had a stormy night, and the vibes caught up.  Even before anyone knew what it meant, Trump and the team started saying it was a coup by Harris. Trump is awful at many things, but he knows how to take people down and manage public opinion. Much like Hitler...     ---  References (APA 7)  Haberman, M. (2023).

"Neither are the reason for the long campaigning season, India has 3x the people and has much shorter campaign seasons, and Canada is larger with much shorter campaign seasons. And even if it were simply a function of population and land area, it wouldn't justify it being 10 or 15 times as long.  The fact that Americans elect the president directly while most countries have parliaments and thus don't directly elect their leaders is a bigger factor than size alone, and this might have justified things 150 years ago, but nowadays not so much.   Many other countries have strict legal limits on the lengths of campaigns, so they remain limited, while the US doesn't (in part due to the first amendment, but not necessarily entirely so), so the election has been free to continue to grow in length as candidates try and build support earlier and earlier.",Calencre,2025-04-25T09:02:02,14

"You are missing the forest for the trees.  Nobody said Biden’s aging was fake. Biden is old. Everyone knew Biden was old. But Trump’s team and conservative media deliberately framed normal aging as catastrophic dementia, and people ran with it. It wasn’t organic concern — it was a manufactured narrative.  At the same time, the same people excusing Trump’s disengagement, limited attention span, and erratic behavior said it was fine — because the cabinet would run the country.  In 2016, Politico reported that Trump insiders reassured donors that “the people around him would handle the day-to-day” while Trump would simply “set the vision.” ([Politico, 2016]())  Chris Christie publicly said Trump would focus on “big picture leadership, not the details.”  Newt Gingrich told Fox News, ""Trump doesn’t know enough to be president, but he doesn’t have to. That’s what his advisers are for.""  Steve Bannon called Trump ""an orchestra conductor"" who doesn't need to know how each instrument works.  In 2024, Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, and others are once again framing Trump’s second term around who he appoints — not his own fitness.  When they say Trump cant run the country, it’s smart leadership.   When Biden is appearing to run the country but has old people moments, it’s proof of collapse. He cant run the country because only the president can.  It was never about cognitive fitness.   It was always about creating a narrative.  The documented origin of the “Biden has dementia” narrative:  The “Biden dementia” conspiracy began on 4chan in 2019, with coordinated threads aimed at portraying Biden as mentally failing during the primaries.  Breitbart picked it up mid-2019, running a now-archived story highlighting Biden’s “gaffes” and “brain freezes” with no medical or factual basis. ([Breitbart archive]())  From there, it was amplified daily across conservative media — Fox News, OANN, Gateway Pundit — until it became accepted as ""common sense"" in the right-wing ecosystem.  It started as a meme. It became ""reality"" through pure repetition.  It was never proven.   It was never seriously investigated.   It was a strategic hit job built on perception, not evidence.  The Bottom Line:  Trump's team admitted he would not handle the day-to-day details.  Conservatives said that was fine because ""strong staff"" would handle it.  Biden delegates, like every president, and it’s framed as collapse.  The ""Biden dementia"" story started as a conspiracy theory — not medical fact, not official finding, not serious journalism.  It was pushed for political gain, and it worked because Biden had a real public stumble after years of narrative poisoning.  Biden’s moment did not create the story.   The story was already built — and people were waiting for anything to validate it.  You are not watching an organic collapse.   You are watching a weaponized narrative complete its cycle.  In the words of 46 ""Come on man""    In the words of 47 ""I love Tesler""  Sources   [Politico: Trump’s Cabinet Would Run the Government (2016)]()  [Breitbart’s earliest Biden ""decline"" article (2019 archive)]()",Royal_Effective7396,2025-04-25T14:17:20,4

"> If you take a step back, stop thinking about Trump for a second, and just look at Biden in isolation, I think you will have to admit it's insane that the Democratic Party couldn't find a better candidate even back in 2020.

It was crystal clear that he was the best option put forward.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-25T13:46:35,2
"It proves the Biden mental decline narrative wasn’t organic—it was a deliberate strategy from Trump’s team. They wanted Biden to be seen as frail and out of touch, so every slip could be weaponized. It wasn’t about facts; it was branding.  It also shows Trump never saw Harris’s nomination or any succession scenario as a coup. It was his calculation from the start. Say what you want about him, but he is one of the most dangerous political strategists in modern history. Not because he’s smart in the traditional sense, but because he knows how to shape public perception and get people to repeat his framing without realizing it.  That kind of influence is rare. And it’s why his narratives stick—truth or not.  Is Biden old? Sure. So is Trump. So is half of Congress. But this was never about who’s sharpest—it’s about how Trump manufactures talking points that people repeat without realizing they’re part of a PR plan.  The birther movement worked the same way. It built Trump’s base by tapping into racial resentment and anti-Obama anger. It boosted his media presence, let him pose as an anti-establishment “outsider,” and created a loyalty test. It also soft-launched his entire presidential brand—loud, divisive, media-savvy, and aggressive. It wasn’t just a conspiracy—it was a test run.  And let’s be clear—Trump was never an outsider. He was in the room when Romney lost in 2012—he stormed out. That’s not “rejected Democrat” energy, that’s old-school GOP insider. His mentor, Roy Cohn, was plugged into the party’s core power network. In the 70s, Trump, Cohn, Stone, Manafort, and Atwater were literally shaping the party’s future. That’s not on the outside—that’s deep in the machine.  So yeah, Biden’s age was always going to show. But the reason it feels so heavy is that Trump trained people to *see it* that way. He seeded the story years ago, knowing Harris would be next in line and that people could be made to fear it. The “coup” narrative? Just part of the calculation.  Biden got old. Trump built the camera lens you're watching it through.  But hey, something something sheep, baahhhhaaaa.",Royal_Effective7396,2025-04-25T11:55:27,3

"  The problem with this conversation is that you are ignoring the direct statements of Trump and his team admitting that this was their strategy, not speculation, not a theory, but their own words. First, we have established that the Biden dementia narrative started as a conspiracy. It originated on 4chan in 2019, pushed as a meme to frame Biden as mentally weak. Breitbart picked it up almost immediately, running stories about Biden’s ""gaffes"" and ""brain freezes"" long before there were any serious public incidents, and with no medical evidence to support the idea. Political meme warfare got laundered into partisan media and eventually mainstreamed—not a diagnosis, not a fact.  Second, Trump and his team openly admitted that they believed the government would run without a fully engaged president. In 2016, Politico reported that Trump’s advisers reassured donors that Trump would “set the vision” while ""the people around him"" would handle the actual government operations. Chris Christie said Trump would be focused on “big picture leadership, not details.” Newt Gingrich said Trump didn’t know enough to be president, but ""that’s what his advisers are for."" Steve Bannon compared Trump to an orchestra conductor who does not need to learn how to play the instruments. This same idea was revived in 2024, when Ben Shapiro and others said what matters is who Trump appoints around him, not Trump’s personal management skills. They openly sold the idea that a disengaged president was acceptable — they normalized it.  Third, Trump and his circle openly admitted that framing Biden as mentally unfit was their strategy. In July 2024, a leaked video from Bedminster caught Trump saying, “He \[Biden\] just quit, you know — he’s quitting the race. I got him out of the race. And that means we have Kamala. I think she’s gonna be better. She’s so bad. She’s so pathetic. She’s just so fucking bad.” The important thing is that Biden had not withdrawn yet — he formally withdrew weeks later, on July 21, 2024. Trump’s campaign strategy documents and ads show that they invested heavily in weaponizing Biden’s age and slips as a central theme. Stephen Miller even called it the “Biden cognition hoax,” openly acknowledging that they were crafting public perception, not responding to facts.  We have established with evidence that the dementia narrative started as a conspiracy. We have established with direct quotes that Trump’s team admitted the government would run without a fully engaged president. With recordings and public strategies, we have established that Trump deliberately pushed this framing to voters before Biden even stumbled. This was not an organic reaction to Biden’s age. It was a coordinated political operation — created, repeated, and admitted to by the people running it. When the people building a political attack tell you openly what they are doing, it stops being a theory. I am repeating what they said and applying things equally on each side. I think its kinda funny Biden ended his career with this treatment, he was an ass. I just wish it wasn't to Trump. Hes a bigger ass.

The point is not whether Biden is showing normal signs of aging.   The point is that Trump’s team weaponized those inevitable signs before they even happened.  It’s called pre-framing.   It’s a basic strategy:  * You tell people what to expect. * You repeat it constantly through media channels. * Then when reality delivers anything even close, people already interpret it through the lens you built.  Biden didn’t need to be in perfect health for this to work.   He just needed to be old — which everyone already knew.  Trump didn’t invent aging.   Trump invented the political *meaning* of Biden’s aging.  That is why, when Biden does something every 80-year-old does — loses his train of thought, moves slower — it doesn’t register as “normal aging” the way it would with your parents or grandparents.   It registers as crisis.  Because you were trained to see it that way, it is documented that this narrative started as 4chan memes, and Breitbart picked it up and ran with it, then you all pushed it.

This sounds rambly because it's a Friday afternoon and I'm beat, but also because he has no coherent belief system so his actions and the things his supporters see neither line up with reality or are predictable.

There's no way to tell what they believe because the guy they're supporting is a leaf in the wind on policy. And there's no defending the tariffs or aggression at our allies, which are two of the only things he's consistent on, so...  Kamala had an impossible task, as it was handed to her so late. I've really only seen criticism of the job she did but it always seems like that's offered without considering the alternatives. She couldn't *force* Biden to step down earlier, and no one else could step in his place when he finally gave up his fight. And that whole time, since 2015, Trump's been screaming every which way to the point that many people threw up their hands and said ""She doesn't inspire me, and I don't like Trump, I'm not voting"". Or they loved him because of their chosen issues. She could hardly inspire as Obama did in 2008 - the deck was never stacked that way.",dubyahhh,2025-04-25T16:05:27,5

Pam Bondi is a great example of someone who should not have so much power, and should just focus on acting like a defense counsel. She’s wrong as US Attorney General.

Biden made the announcement as he and Harris met at the White House on Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandra Mayorkas and other immigration advisers to discuss the increase in migrants, including many unaccompanied minors, arriving at the border in recent weeks.  In delegating the matter to Harris, Biden is seeking to replicate a dynamic that played out when he served as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

"Yes, YOU are ""grasping at straws""      Once the funds were transferred to the DNC, they are no longer ""presidential campaign donations""  The DNC could allocate them in any way they see fit.  Or simply choose to hold on to the funds.  They wouldn't have to spend them on Harris's campaign, especially if they deemed that she had no chance of winning the race (which she never really did)  The point is this.    Harris was the ONLY candidate (other than Biden) that could have direct access to the donations to the Biden/Harris campaign.    And you can make the argument that even the ""Harris/Walz"" campaign legally didn't have access to the ""Biden/Harris"" campaign funds, because technically it is a separate campaign, though this never played out in court, and it's a moot point at this point.  In order to have access to ANY of the ""Biden/Harris"" campaign funds, any candidate other than Harris, would have been at the mercy of the DNC/PAC as to how much, if any, of the funds got spent on their campaign.    Had it been converted to a PAC, then the PAC could only give $3,300 directly to the new candidate.    The PAC could operate an independent expenditure campaign on behalf of the new candidate. But that PAC would not be able to coordinate with the new candidate, and it would have significantly higher advertising rates for television commercials, for example, relative to direct candidate expenditures. This would have the effect of lopping off millions of dollars in terms of value.
