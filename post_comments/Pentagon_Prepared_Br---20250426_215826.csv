Here's Kirk talking on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGD1nuM4MR8  I'm genuinely curious, how do we square these circles?

How many people were aware of what they were working on in the Manhattan Project, I think something like 12? That project was tens of thousands IIRC?  And also, what do you think all of the above is, people like Grusch, Elizondo, Mellon, Jake Barber, and the many others who have come forward over the years, if not leaks?
