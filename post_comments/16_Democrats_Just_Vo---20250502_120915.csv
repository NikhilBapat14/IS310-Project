"It's insane what i see repeated again and again on this app.  I'm a Biden/democrat voter as well and so much of what I see people buy into on these kinds of posts is super disheartening. People are reacting with their emotions, not with logic and compassion. I know it feels good to hate the other side. They're worthy of hate. But this is politics. We have to win the votes for gods sake. We can't alienate everyone who votes for Trump. We need to heal as a country together and calling them Nazis (no matter how much many of their actions begin to resemble that horrible group) isn't helpful. We have to somehow appeal to them and get them to join us. That's a much harder task than lazily calling them nazis and then feeling good about ourselves. But it's one that will actually change the lives of our children for the better.",regolith-terroire,2025-05-02T21:01:29,9

"What list lmao. About how democrats are communists? Lmao I said i reject the other persons list cuz ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a dictator‚Äù . Oh wow thanks for the example/proof. ‚ÄúBiden is a pedo because he likes kids,your turn‚Äù. If I put a crown on my head does that make me a king? You people don‚Äôt understand the political spectrum. You will always be able to find a similar but very distant trait of fascism in Republicans because fascism is just a very far right of republican on the political spectrum. If Hitler did everything trump is doing minus you know ,that very small detail of putting 10 million Jews in a gas chamber,he would not be written in history books and you wouldn‚Äôt be using him as a fascist example. Kamala Harris wants to censor whatever the party/state deems misinformation or makes the party look bad . She wanted to implement that into all news networks and social medias. The democrats had news networks and social media claim anything they said about Covid 19 the state deemed misinformation censored. The fbi under the Biden regime censored and blocked anything about hunter Biden laptop Russian disinformation. In 2025 50 fbi employees are now on admin leave while it‚Äôs under investigation because it was found to be true.That is a PRIME example of why one party should not censor the media. That is the foundation of communism,the stepping stones . So, based on your guys logic ,democrats are communists.",Wise-Swordfish5915,2025-05-03T20:49:32,1

"You've already deleted your response to me because someone else called you out?  Also, do note I did not say ""He is a dictator"". I said that he is a Dictatorial Leader - he leads in a way that dictators want to do, that is, by passing executive orders, and trying to remove anyone who criticizes him, which also includes the media. Which, by the way, is another fascist part; his defunding of all the media that doesn't lick his boots.
