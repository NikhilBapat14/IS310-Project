"She's a fucking idiot. If you scare a bunch of judges, they simply won't process any criminals, and you'll have a massive backup and backlog of people waiting to be processed. You won't be able to deport all of them. Some judges are already doing it. One said that their courtroom will not be open until they are given clear instruction from the Supreme Court.

"Can you imagine any former presidents AG saying this without their being serious repercussions. This is what is pissing me off about democrats. Listen I get that my party is not in power at the moment but that does not mean they are powerless. Republicans have proven time and time again that you need to fight, kick and scream. Even democrats should be subpoenaing Bondi and forcing her to explain exactly what she means to the American people. Will republicans let them do that, probably not but you‚Äôve go to try and if democrats are blocked they need to flood the airways explaining to voters how absolutely bat shit crazy this how republicans are enabling it. Seriously if these people are too afraid to fight the the fuck out of the way and let someone in who will fight. My prediction by the way, is that during the midterms we are going to to see a lot of incumbents kicked to the curb to be replaced with younger more aggressive democrats.",Belkroe,2025-04-28T19:51:49,5
