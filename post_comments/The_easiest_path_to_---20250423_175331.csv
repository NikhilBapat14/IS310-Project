"This easiest path looks very unlikely. Even if we get the selection of candidates, from both parties, suggested it’s still very hard to win all four. I would say only if Susan Collins loses the Maine primary does that race favor the democrats. The rest still favor republicans.",WildMajesticUnicorn,2025-04-23T18:40:02,28

"Jared Golden absolutely will not win the primary for the Senate. Governor Janet Mills, however? She can and would win. She’s the only Democrat in the state that can take out Susan Collins. Edit furthermore we need his seat. He needs to stay right where the fuck he is. Where he can’t cause any harm as well.",Emp3r0r_01,2025-04-23T20:25:30,3

"Tim Ryan isn’t terrible but he’s certainly not a better option than Sherrod Brown. Brown performed 6-7 points better than Harris in the state. He might run for governor tho.   I’m from Ohio and would love for it to become a battleground again. But it really doesn’t seem likely unfortunately, especially with the population decline.   If it doesn’t flip blue in 2026 then you can cement it in your brain as another Missouri-style deep red state.",Done327,2025-04-23T23:05:02,1

This is the sorry state of our so called democracy. Even with 51 seats there's no assurance we could do anything. Will the Senate be willing to torch the filibuster?,frostywontons,2025-04-24T09:21:03,0

"Maybe. But to be fair, Alaska did elect Peltola in a statewide election fairly recently. I honestly think there’s more precedent for winning in Alaska than in Nebraska.  EDIT: a word",Docile_Doggo,2025-04-24T00:37:14,5

"I volunteered for Tim Ryan’s very first House race way back when.   I’ve never seen a man so convinced of his own ability to hold higher office. He was gift wrapped a seat that no Democrat would ever lose when he mentor Jim Traficant went down. Yet from the moment he took it, he’s seemed to have his eye on the next office — despite being unable to win anything other than a very dark blue house seat.",MattTheSmithers,2025-04-23T20:25:25,8

"Dems have few battleground seats to protect and 2 - NC and Me being likeliest to flip. Texas probably would cost enough money to attack than to protect or win 3 or 4 other senate seats dem would target.   Yes, if Cornyn loses, it's like lier and Dems should be spending money on that race. But if Cornyn survives, it's his seat he won't lose a general election.",KathyJaneway,2025-04-24T07:58:25,1
"This!  ☝️it would require keeping Ga, flipping NC and Maine, not losing any other Dem seat and picking up one more.  Not sure where all that happens.   Iowa, Ne, Ks are pipe dreams but the ones that could be had in a massive Dem wave.  But it would have to be massive.   Not likely.  I have family and friends who are hardcore republicans.  They hate Trump and what is happening, but they won’t vote Dem for any reason at any time.  Would need those type of voters to vote Dem to flip the Senate in 26.",whitingvo,2025-04-23T19:13:02,17

"Tbh I think Sherrod Brown is too progressive to win in Ohio now, the state's gone way right and someone a close to the center like Tim Ryan could probably attract more independents in a midterm year.",maybemorningstar69,2025-04-24T11:39:33,0

Some are more vulnerable than others . Cruz is under performer. Cause no one really likes him, but they aren't trying to primary him from. The right - he's already nutjob. Cornyn isn't. He's of the more traditional pre-Trunp era Republicans. Ted Cruz is tea party republican. Ones elected 2010 and after, are more hard right win than before.
