It is all a ruse to invoke martial law.  How many more signs of authoritarianism need to be seen before Congress removes Trump?!,InAllThingsBalance,2025-05-02T07:55:31,61

">One open question is whether someone labeled an enemy combatant and sent to El Salvador’s megaprison CECOT, where the US has already sent hundreds of alleged gang and cartel members, would be able to appeal their detention and removal. > >While the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay had the right to do so, it’s not clear whether that right extends to enemy combatants held anywhere else outside of the US.  The people who have already been sent to CECOT have not been allowed to appeal their detention and removal, even though they have not been labeled enemy combatants. So obviously enemy combatants wouldn't be able to.  The US could bring those people back at any time! We are choosing not to. These people never got due process, and yet they're being held in absolutely awful conditions. They've had no contact with the outside world, so no one knows their health status or whether they're still alive. It's been a month and a half!!! This is a horrific abuse of human rights.",sachiprecious,2025-05-02T08:31:17,13

It’s always been wild to me that Dick Cheney hates Trump so much considering Trump borrows so many pages from the Cheney playbook.,jediporcupine,2025-05-02T08:02:47,3

"Yet another thing that's going to fail in court. The Trump-appointed judge Fernando Rodriguez issued quite a rebuke regarding Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members.

"Don't count on it.  The Supreme Court has already weighed in on the legality of the definition.    Under the Bush administration's interpretation, ""enemy combatants"" were not afforded the same legal protections as POWs, potentially leading to indefinite detention without charge and denial of access to legal counsel.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-02T08:06:16,2

"Are you referring to people who were incarcerated at Bagram and Guantanamo? Boumediene v. Bush still ruled that they had process rights, and also, those ""combatants"" were not on US soil, and were generally ""bounties"" provided by other countries.

"The question is really going to be if Trump can call anyone an enemy combatants if arrested on US soil.  That's why Bush sent them to Gitmo, because the minute they are feet dry they have rights of due process.    Here's a little write up of the law history..,https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/enemy_combatant#:~:text=The%20extraordinary%20status%20that%20accompanies,Third%20Geneva%20Convention%20of%201949.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-02T08:30:17,1
"I cannot find a single instance of a person who was in the US and then sent to Gitmo under Bush or Obama. I hate Bush, but when you're saying that we ""sent them to Gitmo"", it wasn't from the US. 86% of the people held at Gitmo were bounties. I know that extraordinary rendition occurred   The article you sent me references Boumediene and the process rights that the US Surpreme Court asserts enemy combatants have, which still makes me think this strategy isn't going to work for Trump.   Even if Trump calls them an ""enemy combatant"" the accused have Supreme Court adjudicated rights to challenge that classification. Based on what Rodriguez just ruled, I feel like it's highly unlikely that Trump would be successful (but that will not stop him from trying).",canzicrans,2025-05-02T09:01:41,1
"I'm not trying to be combative.  No Bush did not arrest an enemy combatant in the US, but I suspect Trump will.  The idea of an enemy combatant is to deny rights under the constitution.  But the Supreme Court has already recognized the designation so Trump has the ability to simply proclaim it.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-02T09:14:24,2
