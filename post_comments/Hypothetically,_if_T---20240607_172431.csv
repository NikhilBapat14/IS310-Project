This is less of a complex legal debate than a simple practical one. The Secret Service has a proactive responsibility to provide security for Donald Trump. Their authority supersedes that of any state agency.  This makes putting Donald Trump in prison functionally impossible. Anyone who tried to do so would be in violation of federal law.,ViskerRatio,2024-06-08T18:26:51,4
"Although it can still be subject of a debate, here is my take on it,   Trump can be inaugurated in the prison and pardon himself and take office. However, a jail sentence is unlikely if he does ever get a sentence, it will be either suspended or restricted to Mar a Lago.   There is, however, no prohibitions against a convicted felon assuming the office of the presidency. The U.S. constitution only lists three qualifications for the Presidency — the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.  [The Executive Branch | The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/#:~:text=The%20Constitution%20lists%20only%20three,for%20at%20least%2014%20years.)  >The President has pardon or clemency power under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, under the Pardon Clause. The clause says the President “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” The Office of the Pardon Attorney, which is part of the Justice Department, has handled such matters for the President since 1893, and [it has a detailed description ](http://www.justice.gov/pardon/petitions.htm)of the pardon and clemency process on its website.

"If Trump goes to prison, he will probably be afforded visitation rights per state law. The Chief Justice could visit him and administer the oath of office. Trump could then write a letter to the Speaker and President Pro Tempore of the Senate declaring himself temporarily incapable of exercising the duties of the presidency, and the VP would become Acting President.  If the prison denies Trump visitation rights in violation of state law, they would take it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary, and the prison would be forced to allow visitation for Trump.  If state law doesn't allow for visitation, then at noon on January 21, 2025, there would be a vacancy in the presidency, and Trump's VP would become President.",BritanniaRomanum,2024-06-25T02:40:00,1

This only applies if he is sworn in he is a president elect not acting president so technically if he is in jail before he is sworn in he has no immunity and can’t pardon state convictions only federal and Kamala would have been named presidential nominee because trump would not be legally qualified if sentenced to jail. The reason he can even run now is because he has face no jail time but once sentencing is done and he gets charged with time he’s legally not qualified to be president,Cold-Meal-2784,2024-11-06T23:38:50,1

"#**BUT**   >shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for **Offenses against the United States**  He was tried and convicted in a **state** court, so even if elected, could not pardon himself. To prevent it from ever happening, upon sentencing, the judge could have him serve his sentences consecutively. Time off for good behavior? He's be almost 100 and his Alzheimer's/dementia would be at full force. MAGATs would still vote for him, but by then, they'd likely be too few.    He could receive a pardon from the Governor of New York, but that would be in the off chance that a Republican were elected to that post.   By the same token, there are charges against him in the **State** of Georgia. Should he be convicted, again, he wouldn't be able to pardon. He'd need to serve time there once released from New York's penal system. Then it would be up to Georgia's governor to pardon him.   State's Rights would be used to keep him within their system for a few more election cycles. At 85, he'll just be a bad memory for most as he won't have the power to incite outside the prison walls. In prison, he could try to incite other inmates, but his lack of understanding would be limited as he wouldn't be among the general population. He'd be in a protective lockdown, basically solitary, which would prevent that. His daily hour in the exercise yard?  With the right offer, an inmate or guard could easily allow him to join his good friend, Jeffery Epstein. ""Worst case of suicide I've ever seen.

"The Secret Service has nearly unlimited authority to protect their principal - and they enjoy federal supremacy when doing so.  Moreover, it is a violation of federal law to interfere with their protection - and this includes by state actors acting in accordance with their own state laws. So whomever came to bring Trump to prison would be committing a federal felony even if ordered by a state judge.  While the Secret Service normally tries to work with local law enforcement, they don't actually have to do so. They can simply give the locals their marching orders and those locals can either obey or go to prison.",ViskerRatio,2024-06-08T19:08:06,2

"Yes, I can address the state conviction too, but originally, I was thinking about federal convictions. Not state laws. The question was inauguration and his path to presidency if he won.

"That is not correct. Faulty reasoning. One cannot only pardon themselves for impeachment related conviction. It is in the Constitution. As for Nixon, he was not convicted of anything.  He just had the decency to resign because after the House impeached \[or indicted him, not a crime\]; the trial in the Senate started and the indications were there was a majority of votes \[2/3\] in the Senate to convict him. At that point, he resigned, and the Senate trial never concluded and there were no convictions.  As for pardon. There was a danger that after leaving office he could be prosecuted as an ordinary criminal for his conduct with respect to Watergate conduct.  Ford decided to pardon Nixon for any crimes that may have been committed. Pardon power includes crimes that could possibly arise in the future.

"Good read. A simple example of this would be minimum wage laws. While Georgia and Wyoming have minimum wage laws, IIRC, like $5.45/hr, the supremacy law comes into play forcing employers in those states to pay the federal minimum wage. While states like Ohio, Illinois, and California have minimum wage laws that exceed the federal minimum. As long as it meets or exceeds federal law. Is my understanding correct?  Now for the ELI5 question: is there a federal law that supercedes the charges of which Trump has been convicted? I don't believe that should he be elected, ""He needs to be pardoned to serve as president,""  would be an ample reason for him not to serve his sentence. He would need to be able to serve as President from prison, and that would go over like a brick balloon, or the 25th Amendment would come into play:  > Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution reads: > > In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or **Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office**¹, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President .  In other words, the VP could assume his duties as acting president until he was released from prison, his term expired.

"Correct only insofar the application of minimum wages and other similar laws are concerned. That is, however, not the way the Supremacy Clause comes into play. In other words, there is no conflict; it provides for minimum wages; no prohibition is made on maximum wages \[if it did, it would probably be unconstitutional\].   As you noted, many states today pay more than $18.00 per hours; they just cannot pay any less than mandated by federal legislation. If they tried to pay less, that would be a conflict giving rise to Supremacy Clause.     I think the only way to understand the Clause at issue is to focus on the term Conflict.  Here the conflict would arise by imprisonment by state since it would effectively prevent the president from carrying out his responsibilities.   \[Whether intentional or not the assertion above acknowledges that much by noting the 25th Amendment\]. And the Constitution does not prevent a felon from getting elected to the office. The requirements are in the original comment. \[I do not for a moment consider the 25th Amendment to be at issue.\] His inability to discharge would be state action which causes conflict with the Federal mandate of the presidential duties.   As far as legal resolution is concerned court need not impose an immediate sentence, it can be held it in abeyance \[any imprisonment\]. It is not a novel idea. Courts do that as necessary. A higher court also need not invalidate the sentence or overrule the conviction including the Supreme Court \[though it could on some other procedural issues\]. Stated differently, the state can get him after his term as president is completed \[should he be fortunate enough to win again.\]  \[A sentence held in abeyance is a sentence handed down by a judge, but not imposed on the defendant as in the normal course following conviction. Instead, the sentence held in abeyance, means it can be imposed at any time the court deems appropriate.\]  Finally, on a side note, the Judge who will be sentencing him explained during the trial \[more than once\] addressing gag order violations at one time; noting a sentence seeking imprisonment is a last resort and that would not be his preference. Nor did he desire to interfere with his presidential campaign which an imprisonment would cause. The prosecutor, declined to comment whether it would recommend any jail time.   For similar cases in the past, only one out of 10 received any jail time. Given that Trump has a clean record; a probation is more likely, but jail is still possible; but about a zero chance of immediately on July 11, 2024.",PsychLegalMind,2024-06-08T23:58:21,2
"We had a degree of decency during the Nixon times. Nixon's closest allies were literally in tears when they voted against him in the House; as were many Democrats, but they did the right thing. You could watch it for yourself. Available on you tube.   Those days are long gone; there is nothing or very little left of decency in the Congress or for that matter the current majority of the Supreme Court.   Trump could have easily been convicted in the Senate. More than a significant majority in Senate voted to convict him including \[I believe\] 7 Republicans, but it requires 2/3 of the votes in Senate.   As for running, we cannot do anything about it without an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It only requires the person to be 34 years old, be a citizen by birth and must have lived in the U.S. the past 14 years. There are no other requirements, so he is free to run. He could be a murderer and a rapist, be locked up in prison and still run for presidency, though most people wanting to join government would be prohibited even for committing a single crime.

"You were correct the first time. He tried tirelessly last time to gain the power to pardon himself. He failed. Even if he was successful he was convicted in state court and can not pardon himself. As far as going to jail that is murky.    He won't be sentenced to jail because the world isn't fair so it's all mute but if he were my interpretation is that jail time would be delayed until after his term. He should have been removed from the ballot after his convictions. That's what should happen but again. Life isn't fair.    Being president doesn't give him immunity being rich does. He's only still rich because of maggots buying his Chinese merchandise, attending his cult gatherings, and foolishly donating their money. Plus he's a successful con man.    No matter how you shake it this is a dumpster fire. Maggots should be careful what they wish for. He has no reason to pretend he cares about them anymore.
