The IRS has been left in shambles by Trump and Musk. So much so that it's estimated they will [not be able to collect up to $500 billion in tax revenue](https://fortune.com/2025/03/24/irs-tax-revenue-500-billion-cash-x-date-debt-ceiling-default-deadline/) because of these cuts. So basically Americans save a few million on Doge cuts but lose half a trillion in revenue. This is sensible?,biscuitarse,2025-05-04T07:13:04,14

"The majority of middle class and below have already filed and been completed.  The remaining tax filers in limbo are millionaires and up and they hate paying taxes.  So, this just works in their favor.",arilupe,2025-05-04T08:14:04,8
