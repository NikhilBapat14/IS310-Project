This administration isn't going to abide by any of this honor system bullshit. We can't even trust that hard-and-fast laws will have any consequences for breaking them.

"Funny how there is a long and delayed process to speak about exactly what’s going on. Oh yes we must investigate… what’s there to look so deep into? The moron is a crook and everything he does is highly unethical, incriminating or just flat out stupid, because it’s his way or the highway to Mar A Lago. Countless evidence and yet we still need to ask questions to minimise the impact of what’s actually going on. Just an embarrassment at this point to the human and animal race",DLTwhale,2025-04-29T03:50:01,1

Is this an article from 2016? The ship has sailed on “ethics probes.” Maybe focus on actual insider trading or pay for play that is happening at this point,flirtmcdudes,2025-04-28T16:48:22,-1
The Senators in question are Democratic senators.   So their calls for an ethics probe are just rhetorical posturing.    I live in Massachusetts so Elizabeth Warren is one of my senators and she excels at these utterly pointless rhetorical exercises.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T13:21:48,-4
