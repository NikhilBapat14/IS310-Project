"Shoutout to Wisconsin, Michigan, & Pennsylvania. Twice in less than 10 years you voted for a goddamn lunatic rather than let a woman anywhere near the White House, both times with disastrous consequences.  I'm glad Biden's penis earned your vote in 2020. At least you allowed us 4 years of some reprieve before sending us back into the dumpster fire.",M795,2025-04-05T15:23:07,16
"If the DNC is gonna use this ""I told you so""  mentality, and effectively fight hatred with hatred, expect to lose the next few elections that were completely winnable again.   If they haven't learned that they can't fight hate with hate, then we def losing 2026 and 2028.",Naticbee,2025-04-05T10:27:50,-46
"Understable, but not respectable for a leader to say out loud.  Maybe though unfortunately necessary for the times.  She needs to learn from Obama's play book. His speech was inspiring for a world leader.",-Tasear-,2025-04-06T10:53:11,-1

">Shoutout to Wisconsin, Michigan, & Pennsylvania.  Add in as Georgia and Arizona as well. These two are swing states voted for Biden 2020 are the ones voted Trump last year.",Player2LightWater,2025-04-06T08:03:49,1
"No we shouldn't fight hate with hate, we should fight hate with bullying.   Trying to be nice and holding ourselves to a high standard is weaponized by Republicans. They win by holding themselves to no standards and screaming at a Democrat for daring to wear a tan suit.",destinyeeeee,2025-04-05T11:55:56,26
Meanwhile Trump won based on hatred,luvv4kevv,2025-04-05T10:31:17,47
"A decade ago, I probably would have said the same thing. Be MLK Jr, not Malcolm X kind of thinking.   But then Trump won two elections and shipped brown people to Guantanamo and El Salvador for, pretty much, no reason other than their skin color. Without any due process. So no, not anymore.   The time for politeness and “productive disagreement” is over. My rights and the rights of people I care about are under attack. So if it takes saying “I fucking told you so” to motivate people, I say do it. And if they’re willing to die on the Trump train, I say let them.   ***Because contrary to what you’re implying, what we were doing before, with the taking the high road and being the bigger person and not reminding people that they got what they wanted before and it burned them, that’s what didn’t work. That’s what lost 2024. The only certain way to lose in 2026 is to do again what already didn’t work.***",Chiquitarita298,2025-04-05T11:06:57,27
"How so? That's how the GQP keep winning! Learn from this, no more Mr nice guy. Gloves are off. Hell yes we're going to tell.them so. We lost because 10 million Dems stayed home because Dems didn't fight hard enough. No more high road pal. Those days are looong gone",blackie_4,2025-04-05T13:03:37,8
"Saying “I told you so” is an incredibly mild form of hate.  Perhaps the mildest.  Incarcerating innocent people wanting to live in peace, pulling security details, and withholding checks for the impoverished is actual hate.",phxees,2025-04-05T16:41:07,6
"So how did ""they go low, we go high,"" work for us last time?",Fit-Struggle-9882,2025-04-05T18:17:53,1
"She’s probably laughing at the irony of it all, think about the amount of sheer hatred and racist/sexist abuse that was targeted at her and she had to suffer through for years",amievenrelevant,2025-04-05T10:04:04,17
