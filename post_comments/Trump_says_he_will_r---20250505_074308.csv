Itâ€™s like we have a 5-year-old as president,RioRancher,2025-05-05T07:48:42,23
"Ok, so let me get this strait, we can't afford aid to starving children, we can't afford grants for scientific studies, we can't afford research to help cure cancer, we can't afford to run successful and necessary government departments, but we can wast 100 million dollars on a pointless military parade, we can spend 10's of millions of dollars for Trump to fly between his golf courses, and we can afford to rebuild a prison that was closed because it was too expensive to operate?   And for what reason do we need Alcatraz? We already have max security prisons that are modern and work better. This is a pointless and idiotic vanity project for a mentally ill dinosaur. Nothing less, nothing more.   It's stupid. It's moronic, and I'm sick of this crap",stjack1981,2025-05-05T08:10:40,13

"Because the USA doesnâ€™t incarcerate nearly a large enough percentage of its population compared with the rest of the world.  And because locking people away forever really does end crime! and because restoring old, insecure, obsolete prisons is always cost effective!   And because that one movie with whatâ€™s his name.        \*edited to increase sarcasm.",sminthianapollo,2025-05-05T07:49:35,4

"It's a deflection tactic that tRump has used in the past.... Don't look at the man behind the curtain...look this way... All his bullshit about tariffs, that now he seems to be backing down from, to the bullshit over reopening a very old and literally falling apart federal prison that would cost millions to rebuild.................. tRump acts like a 5 year old because his dementia is getting really really bad! **Time to impeach the idiot!**",Harry_Mud,2025-05-05T08:32:22,3
"""Mexico will pay for the wall""",BluWake,2025-05-05T08:03:33,2
We literally have a prison industrial complex and this dumbass wants to reopen that prison in the middle of the bay. A logistical nightmare...bringing materials by boat or helicopter. No wonder this dude went bankrupt 6 times.,mvs2527,2025-05-05T08:30:38,2
Is he gonna reopen Eastern State Penitentiary after that? ðŸ™„,milehighphillygirl,2025-05-05T09:16:03,2

I'm sure it would be the most cost effective prison.    But understand that this is performance theater.   He believes that grave threats will hold people in check.,Afraid_Sample1688,2025-05-05T08:10:10,1
"Can we put him there, since he likes it so much AND is a convicted felon?  Seems like a good fit.",Aggressive-Will-4500,2025-05-05T08:29:59,1
"It was closed because the cost to keep an inmate there was 3 times as much as at other prisons. More proof that he's a ""stable genius""  . . . as a genius who lives in a stable.",edmerx54,2025-05-05T09:21:42,1
"This totally screams govt efficiency. Letâ€™s shut down a museum that generates ~60 million a year in revenue so we can spend millions to reopen the American Bastille that only housed a max 300 prisoners, and then spend twice as much as a more secure ADX facility to operate.",Turbulent-Champion89,2025-05-05T14:03:58,1

"Oh we can afford all of it. We choose not to afford it. These are political choices to *not* afford the things that have made America great, and they serve an interest. What interest is it? The liquidation of public wealth for private benefit. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to you.",PommeDeTerreBerry,2025-05-05T08:36:06,5
Underestimated that percentage. Needs more decimal places.,PommeDeTerreBerry,2025-05-05T08:37:33,2
"Difference is that that was almost certainly made up by polemical historians based on accounts from his political enemies. He was generally popular with the public, and even if he may have been unhinged, most of the stories about him are from much later, political enemies and absurd, so very iffy",AndreasDasos,2025-05-05T08:05:01,5
If he sees your comment he probably will with how crazy he has been,feelinuneasy1234,2025-05-05T08:17:46,2
He actually proposed a UFC for migrants https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/trump-migrants-ufc/index.html,Agreeable-Rooster-37,2025-05-05T08:29:11,2
"It wouldn't be cost effective at all. It was shut down because of how astronomicaly expensive it was to operate and maintain. Salt air just corroded everything on it.  Does this one even count as a threat though? Its Adam West era Penguin level absurdity. Its not like there's not a far, in my opinion, scarier prison across the bay from Alcatraz. Granted San Quentin is a State Prison and not a federal one I suppose.   But him trying to restore a historical landmark to be used as a modern prison doesn't exactly have me quaking in my boots.   Dudes just mad El Salvador was getting all the credit for the super death prison and thanks Alcatraz will be as scary sounding as Gitmo.   Alternativly he can't help but identify with the mobsters it held and he Freudian slipped his way into this one.",19chevycowboy74,2025-05-05T09:30:57,2
