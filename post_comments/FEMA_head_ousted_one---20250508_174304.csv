Getting rid of FEMA is just ignorance made manifest.,FalstaffsMind,2025-05-08T17:49:37,38
This proves he wants to eliminate it. Then they can steal land from desperate people who lost everything. He can also get revenge on Carter for dying before his inauguration. Greasy orange hog.,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-05-08T17:55:35,11
This administration is allergic to facts.,jpcapone,2025-05-08T17:43:33,7
"The South utilizes FEMA assistance the most because of their natural disasters. Well, they might have to learn to live without disaster relief, but on the bright side, abortion is illegal there.",RiseDelicious3556,2025-05-08T19:49:54,4
"'For some of you the potential price you need to pay for my policies just went way, way up,' thought trump without any real concern.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-08T17:54:14,2
"Getting rid of FEMA is an admission that the GOP is only looking out for the 1%. The Rich will always seek out residences in safe havens. When a storm threatens, the 1% are the first on their jet to their other home where it’s safe. Then their insurance pays out. But the poors? Why would the Uber rich wanna pay taxes so the poors can survive a hurricane?",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-08T18:35:41,20
"Not ignorance, but malice.",ISeePupper,2025-05-08T21:14:45,6
"Getting rid of FEMA is also getting rid of the method the federal government tends to its  own properties and infrastructure post-disasters.  You know… washed out roads, bridges, communications and the like. The  F stands for “ Federal “ after all",Remote_Clue_4272,2025-05-09T08:05:25,2

How else will they buy up all that cheap land,AVGuy42,2025-05-08T23:22:00,3
"Malice born of ignorance.  Without FEMA, there is nobody to organize and facilitate disaster responses.  The idea that you leave it up to the states ignores the fact the states requesting FEMA assistance are overwhelmed.  DOGE and Trump pretend to be fighting inefficiency, but really what they are fighting is capability.",FalstaffsMind,2025-05-08T23:00:29,4
