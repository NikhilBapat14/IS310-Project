Colombia is an absolute disaster and while now fully attributable to him, he is doing anything but helping.

Utter rubbish. Just regurgitating rightwing foolishness with zero comprehension of where he was at the time of the attacks you claimed he committed.

"Gemini   **Gustavo Petro was a member of the M-19 guerrilla group.** He joined the movement at age 17. ¬†  1. **The M-19 group was responsible for the Palace of Justice siege** in Bogot√° on November 6-7, 1985. During this event, M-19 members took hostages, leading to a violent military response that resulted in the deaths of around 100 people, including Supreme Court justices, civilians, soldiers, and M-19 members. 2. **However, Gustavo Petro did** ***not*** **participate in the Palace of Justice siege itself.** At the time of the siege in November 1985, he was imprisoned. He had been arrested weeks earlier (around October 1985) for illegal arms possession. ¬†  I am not 100% certain of the accuracy but there it is.",jpcapone,2025-04-23T17:40:09,5
"Was he or was he not a part of M-19 when they bombed the Colombian Supreme Court? I didn‚Äôt frame anything incorrectly what so ever. Maybe left out the fact that it was quite a while ago in the 80s but the point stands. Are you arguing Colombias current political climate is good or‚Ä¶? Because frankly, nothing there is good, and those who voted for him, which was mostly the lower class, are regretting it, ex. his failure to pay them for switching from cultivating coca",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T17:18:36,-1
"The Vatican is a country within a country, so they have their own rules.  I would be curious if you could find the source that discusses about Trump‚Äôs restrictions.

"Now if you have an actual argument defending the current administration as opposed to changing the topic to past administrations, would love to hear it",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T17:54:22,0
"The denials of him participating are by himself. Yet according to this, it is incorrect to say that he most definitely participated in them. What I can say is he was part of the same group that bombed the Palace of Justice. I think that in itself is bad enough, regardless of if he participated personally or not, the point is he is an ex-guerrilla. I am not defending the false positives scandal by Uribe as it‚Äôs frankly horrific as well. Yet, Uribe was one of the most loved presidents for the safety during his term. That said, it‚Äôs an argument of if the sacrifice of the crackdowns are worth the public‚Äôs general peace, similar to the situation in El Salvador right now, but that is much more extreme, and frankly Obama in the Middle East. I am not pro-Uribe or pro-Petro, my point is Petro is awful and he should not be given ‚Äúprops‚Äù, we were never even talking about past administrations.",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T17:50:56,-2
"I‚Äôm not trying to support either the right wing nor the left wing, frankly ever single part that comes in to office, left or right, is a disaster, Petro, Duque, Santos, and Uribe alike. And I‚Äôm trying to be open minded here because I didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt confirmed that Petro wasn‚Äôt in the bombing. But yes, Colombia is quite the disaster right now, and heading towards a similar trajectory as Venezuela, which is a much more publicized issue. And personally, while Petro didn‚Äôt start this downfall, I think he is contributing",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T21:00:48,1
How many state sanctioned massacres have been connected to Petro?   Odd he‚Äôs so loved when he‚Äôs on trial for mass murder of Colombian citizens.,Thr8trthrow,2025-04-23T19:22:06,2
"Once again, I‚Äôm not arguing his superiority or inferiority to his predecessors, nor am I even comparing him to Uribe, I‚Äôm analyzing Petro individually as a president. If you wanna debate Petro‚Äôs presidency individually then you‚Äôre welcome to, but making a straw man argument is just futile. What Uribe did was horrendous, but that‚Äôs beside the point. The point is, Gustavo Petro, as the president of Colombia, sucks",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T20:58:00,0
"Yeah I guess when you completely take him out of context in every way, he's just not up to your high standards. Also, I'm not straw manning you, getting rid of death squads is literally and improvement lol. You're just regurgitating rightwing media nonsense.   When Petro came in, the inflation rate was 10%. Now its half that. Tell me more though about how awful everything is with the halved inflation and no death squads?",Thr8trthrow,2025-04-23T21:44:38,2
"You just repeat ‚Äúregurgitating‚Äù, ‚Äúright wing‚Äù, and ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù on a loop. It‚Äôs not like he deliberately searched out death squads and shut them down. Arguing with you is just a joke if you think I‚Äôm right wing extremist.",kramertheserval,2025-04-23T21:56:10,1
"no just a rightwing apologist, if you can't detect the delta between Petro's flawed presidency and guys who sent out death squads that collected the poor and homeless and massacred them.
