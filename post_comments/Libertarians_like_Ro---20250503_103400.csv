"I don’t see an issue with a national ID, when you already have multiple ways of identifying you on the state level and national level, but no consistency to prove you are a US citizen.",mdws1977,2025-05-03T10:53:12,25
Article has a paywall.   I don't see what the issue is with requiring states to ensure that ID cards that they issue are accurate.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-03T10:49:32,15
"I really don't get the paranoia of some over a national id. Not like we don't have state id's, SSNs, etc.",awdorrin,2025-05-03T12:34:28,13
"But Jim Harper, a senior fellow of digital privacy and constitutional law at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that though REAL ID is not technically a national identification card, since it is issued by individual states, obtaining one enters private citizens into a national database, effectively making it a national identification system.  ""REAL ID is a national ID system. And historically, national ID systems have been used for terrible things,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that we don't position ourselves in the United States ever to have that much authority reside with the government. And so, for two decades now, I've been arguing against REAL ID, simple as that.""",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-03T13:03:39,6
"We all have an ID, a REAL ID verified ID just means it’s real. It doesn’t change our identities, our records, or the availability of that data.  If my FL Driver license were not Real ID compliant, the government would have the exact same data on me, they just now when I show my ID - it’s actually me.  This is a nothing burger.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T11:55:21,7
Stop issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens and the government wouldn’t have to fix a problem they created. States can put right on the license non citizen driver if they have to drive.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-03T14:20:29,5
We'll find out next week when I fly outa here.  Wyoming had the star first.  Now it's a black star not gold.,ApricotNo2918,2025-05-06T22:43:43,1
"It isn't that it is a national ID, it is what will they decide to make it into.  Remember Social Security was NOT supposed to be for identification but they changed the law in 1972 to make it into an ID.  Give the government an inch they take a lightyear.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:03:35,3
"Many hardcore libertarians are against driver's licenses, fishing licenses, basically any government mandated licensure.  It's not so much paranoia, it's the notion that government is involved.  Live free or die baby.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-03T12:49:22,11
I would welcome a new ID number designed as JUST an ID number so everyone doesn't ask for your SSN just to be sure you are who you say you are.,ngoni,2025-05-03T12:43:52,10
What if I just have a fake ID?,imabetaunit,2025-05-03T13:34:02,2
"My problem with it is why does each state have a separate Real ID then. just get it over with and make it national. And why is it tied to my Driver's License.  -----------------  Paywall, can't even read it to see the discussion. I guess some are against a national ID, but then why are we all accepting a pseudo-national one.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-05-03T12:37:02,5
Exactly. I didn't need a SS# until I actually wanted to get a real job. About age 13. Now people are getting SS cards when the baby is born.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:05:04,1
"Way back when, before the Civil War the United States was commonly referred to as THESE united States. The Founders looked on the States as what they knew, individual countries, banding together for a few meager things for the Federal to control. State is also considered a Country.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:09:35,2
"Because why make taxpayers pay for two ID’s?   Why make taxpayers who already pay for their State System, also pay for implementing, managing, staffing, building coats - and the background IT services that would be required for a Federal system?   I think folks have frothed this up to be something, it really isn’t.  My Florida ID has been Real ID compliant for about 13 years.  In FL if your drivers license is real ID compliant, there’s a gold star on the upper right corner.  That star says it’s real ID compliant, which in turn is just a verification saying this person really is almost certainly who they say the ID says they are. That’s it.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T13:16:58,0
"Yea, so you should see why having individual ""COUNTRY"" ids isn't going to serve the purpose that Real ID or such is meant to solve. You guys all want voter ids right. So just make a government id.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-05-05T08:22:23,1
I don't remember paying for my SSN. For my SSC. I just have it. It runs in the background. I don't know why you are saying suddenly a system needs us to keep investing more when existing systems are running already too.,QuietRedditorATX,2025-05-03T14:04:05,3
You guys? I am the one arguing against it... so I am not in the YOU GUYS category.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:29:58,2
"You aren't paying for anything additional though. You already pay for your state issued license to drive, the only difference is now it's linked to a national database. No need for a separate identification which inevitably would cost money. The real ID system merely utilizes state resources already implemented and ties the state database to a national database. It costs nothing for you.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-03T14:27:05,0
Who said I care about costs? I want things done right. My state driver's license expires every few years. My identity should not. It makes no sense to tie it to the state IDs.,QuietRedditorATX,2025-05-03T19:30:52,4
"And this reply makes zero sense. It literally takes zero effort on your part to get a renewed license that IS a real ID. You want things done right, great, get a real ID. It ties it to a national database initially, after that it's always tied to said database. You act like you have to jump through extra hoops to make this happen.  >Who said I care about costs?   ""I don't remember paying for my SSN. For my SSC....a system needs us to keep investing more..."" This you?",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-03T20:25:35,0
"Yea, and did I say ""Oh no! I don't want to pay money for ID."" No, I didn't. The other guy was saying a National ID would cost a lot of money, and I pointed out that SSN right now exists and no one thinks about its costs to give each citizen one.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-05-03T22:04:19,0
