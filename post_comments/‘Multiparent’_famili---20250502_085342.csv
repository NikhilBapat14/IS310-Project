"The left really feels children are little more than pre-Democrats who need enough “proper” education (ideology), or accessories to “live your best life”.   This is horrific. Imagine the custody battles.  The kids who can’t keep one parent engaged with them, because they all feel the other spouses are doing the work.",cliffotn,2025-05-02T16:32:34,7
Tell me again how Trump was the cause of Canada electing a liberal again? Because it looks a lot like they are culturally inclined towards liberalism.,triggernaut,2025-05-02T08:55:24,23

"Canada has two liberal parties, and liberal loony vote is split between these two usually.   When Trump started to actively intervene in Canadian politics, vote share of the smaller liberal party collapsed and all loonies voted for the larger liberal party.   The conservatives here had their best performance since 1988, but they still couldn’t win because the left vote consolidated instead of being split.   And now we have another 4 years of bullshit to deal with up here, so a lot of conservatives are pretty annoyed with Trump.",patrick_bamford_,2025-05-02T09:08:45,10
