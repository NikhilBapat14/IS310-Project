These people are not afraid of him, they ARE in it with him. Why is this so hard to understand??? At this point, after everything that has come to fruition, as crazy as it may have sounded at first light‚Ä¶  Really..  Stop giving them any credit. They are in on ALL of it.",Healmetho,2025-05-02T15:30:30,7
