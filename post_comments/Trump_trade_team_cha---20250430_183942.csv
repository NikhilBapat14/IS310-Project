But. I thought he already made 200 deals with the 195 countries that exist in this world. Is this an ADDITIONAL 90 deals or?,1nconsp1cuous,2025-04-30T19:20:18,20
"We're now 19 days into their 90 deals in 90 days plan and have not a single deal to show. Not one.  Senate GOP just failed American citizens by continuing on with ""Liberation Day"" tariffs in a final tally of 49-49.   Make sure to thank the spineless senators who did this to you.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-30T18:43:03,9
I thought the plan was to bring back manufacturing jobs with tariffs. So why are we negotiating their removal?,skepticalbob,2025-04-30T22:03:44,5
"It is laughable of course given most serious trade agreements take around a year or so.  What they may do is come up with a ""memo of understanding"" or such which lays out a basic framework but guarantees nothing now or in the future.  They will then sell this as a win to the hordes of Maga's who will then brag about Trump's great negotiation skills again.",zubbs99,2025-04-30T19:23:16,2
"This is like when a project manager doesn't give any room for error in their project estimate, then they run out of money and can't deliver on time. People get fired for that sort of thing... not in this administration, you'll get promoted.",2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-30T20:19:47,2
"I'm confused, Trump already said that he made 200 trade deals.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-04-30T20:27:58,2
I think his 200 deals includes a heap of. Companies begging for exceptions. ,DeadlyFern,2025-04-30T21:42:00,2
"As an Australian, anyone making a deal with the Trump regime would be signing their political death warrant.  I suspect that we would not be alone in this.",Own_Error_007,2025-04-30T21:47:48,2

I bet Biden would be able to make 90 deals in 45 days.,SuckingDuckForQuack,2025-04-30T18:43:19,1
I asked a MAGA person I know I’ll see what they say.,zffjk,2025-05-01T06:29:05,2
I assume by the end of the 90 days they will manage a handful of token deals. India seems willing so maybe India drops all tariffs and restrictions on US beef in exchange for dropping tariffs with it something pointless but that Trump will tought as a win.,cjh42,2025-04-30T19:28:19,5
"90 days for one deal would be an absolutely absurd turn around time. Like for reference most deals of this sort take well over a year, and a 6 month turnaround is an insanely fast one",Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-30T23:01:34,2
How about just not making one terrible deal in the first place?,ZZartin,2025-04-30T18:45:39,4
Not going to sell much beef to an 80% Hindu country.,SealEmployee,2025-04-30T20:05:00,6
This is Trump we're talking about. Not making a terrible first deal is impossible.,OnlyFollowing1,2025-04-30T18:53:32,5
That was my point yes. A token meaningless concession. Same as the last concession between Trump and Europe last term over beef that essentially allowed US beef if it passed European health requirements which such a small amount does that was essentially meaningless that time as well.,cjh42,2025-04-30T20:06:29,5
