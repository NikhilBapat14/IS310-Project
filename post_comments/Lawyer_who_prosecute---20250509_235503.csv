For prosecuting the most obvious possible crime with absolute cut and dry evidence. This country is a sick joke.,Beforemath,2025-05-10T00:14:30,482
"Jay Bratt should answer what ever question they have by laying out the evidence as he would in a case.  Republicans will complain and ask for their time back, but Bratt should just continue to lay out the case!  It would be great if it was in a public hearing!",NAU80,2025-05-10T00:24:19,100
"Deposing the guy who was part of an investigation into your dear leader's painfully cut and dry criminal misconduct is some real draconian level shit...  Just say the quiet part out loud already. You all support a dictatorship and anyone who has, or ever will question king Trump, is to be put before a panel, made an example of, and punished accordingly.  And don't forget to mention how it's all justified in the name of ""saving the country."" But even if it isn't, there won't be any consequences because you'll have consolidated enough power by the next election that—as Trump himself puts it—the American people ""won't have to vote anymore.""",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-10T00:20:40,135

"This is what they are after:  ""In [repeated letters](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/JDJ%20and%20Loudermilk%20to%20Jack%20Smith%2011.8.24.pdf) to the former special counsel last year, House investigators demanded information from Smith about contacts between the Biden White House and the justice department about the criminal cases, including when Bratt once travelled to the White House.  They also sought documents and communications about meetings between FBI and justice department officials before the decision was made to ask a magistrate judge for a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. Bratt is widely understood to have encouraged FBI leaders to obtain a warrant.  The warrant later proved to be the basis for the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice charges against Trump; the FBI retrieved 101 classified documents despite Trump’s lawyers having previously claimed that they had complied with an earlier subpoena to return all classified materials.  The House judiciary committee has also taken a special interest in a fraught and disputed meeting between then-Trump legal team attorney Stanley Woodward and Bratt at justice department headquarters during the height of the classified documents case in November 2022.  The Guardian [previously reported on the complaint](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/lawyer-trump-valet-nauta-mar-a-lago-classified-documents-misconduct-allegation) that Woodward filed in federal district court in Washington about the meeting, where he alleged Bratt discussed Woodward’s application to be a judge while trying to get the cooperation of Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet and Woodward’s client.  In the filing, Woodward alleged that Bratt told him he did not think Woodward was a “Trump guy” and that “he would do the right thing” and get Nauta to testify against Trump in the classified documents case.  The allegation was that Bratt had engaged in possible misconduct by suggesting Woodward’s judgeship application might be considered more favorably if he convinced his client to flip. The matter was referred to the justice department’s office of professional responsibility but it does not appear as though any action was taken.  The extent of any potential impact on the case was unclear, since the meeting did not appear to have directly affected any testimony Nauta gave to prosecutors, and Bratt would not have had the ability to influence such an application, which is handled by the White House counsel’s office.""",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-10T07:49:02,4
