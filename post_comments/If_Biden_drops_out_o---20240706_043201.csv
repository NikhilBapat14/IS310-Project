"Harris wouldn't automatically become the Democratic frontrunner if Biden dropped out--technically, as the party nomination hasn't been finalized yet, the Democrats could pick anyone at the convention.   But logistically, there are a lot of reasons why it would almost certainly be Harris who replaced Biden. One of them is money--Harris is a part of the current ticket, so she can directly inherit all the money the campaign has currently raised. If someone other than Harris becomes the candidate, campaign finance laws prevent them from inheriting most of it. They would have to start fundraising from scratch, and you don't want to be doing that in July.  Harris could have anyone as a running mate; it doesn't need to be the Speaker.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-06T10:18:04,19
">Currently, if Biden resigns or dies in office, Kamala would then become President and Speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, a Republican, would become VP  Harris becomes the President, but Johnson does not become VP. If the VP spot is vacant for any reason - for example if the VP dies or resigns - the President selects a VP who requires a majority vote from both the House and Senate to be confirmed.",FiveDollarHoller,2024-07-06T11:40:44,9
"Why wouldn’t you want to vote for trump anyways? No wars, a president that gives us a great economy, cheap gas, cheaper groceries, cheaper living…as a middle class citizen who wouldn’t want that? Because the democrats are certainly not going to do it! But hey, you don’t “like how trump talks “ so even though the country was in great shape and he protected us, he did everything we want from a president ..but just go with your emotions. That makes sense. #Not",cheri1984,2024-07-11T20:02:42,2
"If he drops out it will be decided at the convention, like how we used to do it.",roastbeeftacohat,2024-07-07T03:55:34,1
"If Harris is the front runner, that would mean giving up and surrendering to Trump.  Harris does not bring much to the ticket.",TexasYankee212,2024-07-06T19:26:16,3
"Adding to this: if Biden were to resign (he will not) and Harris were to become POTUS, Mike Johnson would not become the VP. That’s not how the line of succession works.",lyman_j,2024-07-06T17:39:55,11
"Like they did when Agnew resigned. Nixon nominated Ford, who had to be confirmed. Nixon then resigned, Ford inherited the presidency, and he nominated Rockefeller.",Swiggy1957,2024-07-07T00:44:32,1
She can galvanize pro-choice women in ways Biden couldn't. She is a minority and would likely increase votes from fellow minorities. She would also likely bring in those in the base and independents concerned about Biden's age.,deltalitprof,2024-07-06T20:02:55,3

She is also from California and California will vote democrat anyways.  The democrats need someone in the contested states.,TexasYankee212,2024-07-06T22:49:44,4
