">John Martini, an expert on Alcatraz history who served as a park ranger on the island in the 1970s, told the San Francisco Chronicle that it would be impossible to reopen the prison because the building is “totally inoperable,” with no water or sewage, and electricity only in certain parts.  >Said Martini: “It was falling apart and needed huge amounts of reconstruction, and that would have only brought it up to 1963 code. It was always an extremely expensive place to run.”  >In additon, Alcatraz “was nearly three times as expensive as other U.S. prisons to run, due largely to the fact that food, water and fuel had to arrive",rapidcreek409,2025-05-05T09:53:11,17
"Take a few minutes and write down 5 insane things trump might do, along the lines of this moronic Alcatraz idea.   I bet you'll see one of them come true within a year",ElPlywood,2025-05-05T09:57:42,7
I don’t know if it’s true but someone mentioned “escape from Alcatraz” was recently added to Netflix.   It would explain a lot if true.,citizenkane86,2025-05-05T10:11:18,6

Had to look up why it was closed in the first place which was high costs and multiple breakouts.  Lol at cutting social services so we can pay more for inefficient prisons.  Nothing more American than that.,GhoostP,2025-05-05T13:55:31,2

He was just looking for something the media would hype so he could make a dog whistle threat to domestic protestors.,theombudsmen,2025-05-05T10:19:12,1
"When I told my husband this news he told me there was absolutely no way it would happen. In any other administration I would obviously agree, but I have stopped allowing logic to comfort me when it comes to him. We now have a bet going, if Alcatraz opens during Trump's reign, I win (win what you ask? Absolutely nothing).",Keyezeecool,2025-05-05T15:44:33,1
"There is a post on BlueSky that said the movie aired on TV in Palm Beach while Donald was there and then he started posting about reopening it.    Dude might be getting ideas from tv, somebody needs to get schoolhouse rock in front of him.",NinjaKlaus,2025-05-05T13:17:53,3
I’m assuming what this move is actually about is taking a major tourist attraction away from a blue state.,Demonking3343,2025-05-05T10:01:15,6
