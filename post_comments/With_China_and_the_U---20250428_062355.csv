"It is hard to imagine even 6 months ago but China increasingly looks like the better bet.   Imagine two grocery stores: one always has its doors open, prices clearly marked, and deals honored no matter who walks in. The other sometimes changes prices without notice, rewrites the rules for certain customers, and occasionally pulls products off the shelf mid-transaction.   Who would you do business with?",TubeframeMR2,2025-04-28T06:41:51,7
"Trump put himself in a pickle.  China isn't going to budge, and if Trump backs down, it will make him look more a fool than he already is.  It will be interesting to see how he gets out of the madness he created.",Smithy2232,2025-04-28T06:36:46,4

"I just wish Trump could say or do *anything* that would result in his cult turning away from him.  Cruelty? No. Unconstitutional actions? No. Crashing the economy? No. Surrending our preeminence in the world? No. Bolstering the positions of China and Russia, as we're made into international fools? No.  Nothing breaks the cult. They'll starve to death praising his name.",BaronGrackle,2025-04-28T06:55:15,4
There is nothing he can or will say that will push the cult away from him. They blame legislation from his first term to Biden and Obama.Â ,SpiritedEclair,2025-04-29T02:16:07,2
