"If it was all about race, how do they explain all the African-Americans who were drafted in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th rounds.....well before Sanders? Some assertions are immediately and incontestably refutable.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-26T17:49:31,26
FYI a black quarterback was drafted 1st overall. To argue that a different black quarterback wasn't drafted until the 6th because of racism requires you to either have room temperature IQ or be a despicable person.,puzzical,2025-04-26T18:00:39,25
"From many players at the time, Kaepernick was not that good of a Quarterback.   So I guess this means this player is not that good in his position either if it is the same?",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T16:56:37,13

"Sanders is a backup QB talent wise with a massive ego and attitude. He was passed over until so late because no team wants to spend a quality draft pick on a backup QB and definitely not one that brings a media circus with them. This is the Tebow effect: when the outside circus is greater than the value you bring to the team, no team wants you. Tebow did not bring it on himself but the result is the same.",captainfreaknik,2025-04-26T18:45:32,12

"BTW Kaepernick wasn't drafted till the second round, 36th overall.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T16:57:30,3
"Yet Daniel Jeremiah kept saying he had him in the top 20 and couldn't understand why he went so late. Everything else i read is that Sanders' Colorado team never played ""anyone,"" so his impressive numbers might have been different if he had to play in the SEC, for example.",Sodola321,2025-04-26T19:37:03,3
The Kaep situation was never about where he was drafted. Do you follow football at all?,GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-26T19:37:35,0
Not since that idiot started shitting on our country and other players followed suit. Bunch of entitled babies whining.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T07:37:58,2
If you followed it previous to that then you’d know it had nothing to do with his draft position.,GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-27T09:10:56,1
I was pointing out that the player in the OP wasn't picked up in the first round and that is one of the reasons they are crying. Then he is compared to Kaepernick who ALSO was not picked up in the first round....  Sorry you didn't follow that or chose to ignore it. Not sure which.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T09:20:31,2
"The assertion about feeling like Kaepernick, again, has nothing to do with his draft spot and more to do with teams passing on talent due to racial bias. Kaepernicks slide out of the first had nothing even remotely close to the race card - it wasn’t even a talking point. You’re connecting two unrelated pieces.",GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-27T09:46:44,2
How do you know it is Racial Bias? Because the news told you and just like Beyonce' claiming racism for not getting Country Music fans to love her?  Has nothing to do with Racism. Kaepernick was also a mediocre quarterback.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T09:53:12,1
I didn’t say it was racial bias?  I said that’s the assertion being made. Are we reading the same thing?,GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-27T14:18:39,1
more to do with teams passing on talent due to racial bias  Sounds like you are saying it is racial.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T17:57:11,1
Reading comprehension isn’t your strong suit it seems?  It’s a continuation of the sentence beginning with “the assertion”.   Try again.,GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-27T18:27:37,1
Looks like a separate thought to me.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T18:32:54,1
"Your comment  The assertion about feeling like Kaepernick, again, has nothing to do with his draft spot and more to do with teams passing on talent due to racial bias.  Notice that little AND there that usually means according to my mother who was an English Major, that the first section is a separate thought from the second section. You MAY have MEANT it to be an assertion for both statements but you didn't write it that way. I am not a mind reader. Nor is anyone else for that matter. So if you don't present your words properly then how are we to actually communicate.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T18:38:09,1
I don’t really know how to make it more clear for you especially after explaining it multiple times. Unfortunate.,GimmeDatClamGirl,2025-04-27T18:45:37,1
"It’s a comparison statement and a common usage of the vernacular. I’m sorry if you struggle to comprehend that.
