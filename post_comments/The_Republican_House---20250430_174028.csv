"and in non medicaid expansion states, only the disabled, minors, pregnant or elderly are receiving medicaid. I myself am disabled but my social security benefit amount puts me over the limit for ""full medicaid"". luckily, I qualify for low income subsidy (lis) and extra help from Medicare (yay for having Medicare! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).   However, in just the county I live in there's 3 hospitals and about 25 nursing home facilities. The hospitals consume a large amount of funding. So do the nursing homes. And then the amount of doctor offices. Dear lord, the amount of doctor offices. Many who accept medicaid (for the adults) unless it's the majority of their practice (for minors). So many people are going to lose their jobs from the healthcare field.   And of course, when people have no job- they don't contribute to the economy. Additionally, when there are no healthcare providers (or an extremely small amount of providers who won't continue with medicaid) then people won't be getting healthcare. So more people will end up not contributing to the economy (because they will be dead- want to know what dead people really suck at doing? Contributing to their economy.) Eventually, stores are going to be closing their doors because they won't have enough people buying their shit, so even more people are going to end up without a job and not contributing to the economy.   Yup, shit is going to get super bad.",SnooChocolates1198,2025-05-01T02:01:27,1
