"Constantly flooding the space with a new controversy every hour takes up all the attention of the media, and ensures no alternative gets heard.  American media has never known how to cover Trump, and isn't getting any better at it. From their point of view, why bother to look for stories that get engagement, when Trump hands it to them on a plate. Why try to discuss issues, when the clickbait works for them.",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-06T10:23:30,45

"From Semafor's David Weigel:  Democratic leaders love talking about the president’s flagging poll numbers. Their own numbers, not so much.  When House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries got asked recently to react to a colleague who worried that the party was too focused on El Salvador, he pivoted: “Our reaction is that Donald Trump has the lowest public approval rating of any president in modern American history.”  One day later, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer boasted that “Trump has the lowest 100-day approval rating since they started polling 80 years ago,” CNN’s Manu Raju turned the question back on him. Schumer’s own approval rating was 17% in CNN’s poll, much lower than Trump’s.  “Polls come and go,” said Schumer. “Our party is united.”  Polls nonetheless put Democrats in a notably weak position for a party aiming to win back Congress next year. In special elections held since Trump took office, Democrats have usually beat expectations, holding their Wisconsin Supreme Court majority and winning a slew of down-ballot races. But the party’s image has not recovered from 2024, and its marks in the spring of 2017 were higher than today.  “Voters don’t necessarily trust that Democrats are going to stand up for them,” said Ian Smith, the director of polling and analytics at the Democratic firm Navigator Research, and before that a pollster at the Kamala Harris campaign. “Even folks that are seeing pain from what Trump’s doing see some logic in it.”  [Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2025/trumps-falling-in-polls-why-arent-democrats-benefiting?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)",semafornews,2025-05-06T10:19:48,4

That's what the Republicans have done for years.  The Maga have used terrorist tactics to stop Democratic campaigns in Texas (any convictions on that), not to mention 1/6.

He's also not the only Democratic politician doing this either. As a queer person, I fundamentally do not trust the Democratic party as an institution on queer issues anymore. I trust some *individual* Democrats. But the past few months have been eye opening as to how many Democratic politicians view trans people as acceptable collateral.

So after many voters voted to replace democracy with autocracy last November, they still believed Democrats could stop it… but they cannot so long they are in the minority.

Yes I am surprised. Because if Democratic leaders did what Republican leaders did, they'd be just as corrupt as Republicans. For those who want to support corrupt that party is Republicans, the Democratic party must instead back ethics to stand out.",SeductiveSunday,2025-05-07T14:13:37,0
