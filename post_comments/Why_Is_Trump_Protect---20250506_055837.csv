"The point isn't to protect ""Hollywood,"" it's to protect the *American* cities and states that produce TV/movies.   ""Hollywood"" doesn't want this. They want to make their shitty TV shows and movies internationally (Canada)",john_the_fisherman,2025-05-06T06:13:20,28
"I think most of Hollywood would actually want it. I’m talking about the tens of thousands of support workers who provide catering, lights, and everything in between that work multiple jobs. They want the work to be done locally instead of Canada, UK, etc. It’s the CEOs that want to do it in cheaper locations (due to tax incentives) that are against it. It’s actually something that the vast majority of Democrats who constantly rail against corporate greed should want.",r777m,2025-05-06T10:13:36,6
Concur.  I think this is specifically targeted at Netflix.  They 'outsource' a *lot* of content.,bozoconnors,2025-05-06T08:09:20,4
