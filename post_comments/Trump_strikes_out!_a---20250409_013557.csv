Half our registered voters were too lazy to bother to even vote because the thought of voting for an Ivy league, self-made black/indian woman was too much for them and they didn't want trump so they sat home and decided they weren't going to vote. Millions of votes were rejected by republican ran polling stations and their election staff claiming ""signatures didn't exactly match"" or some stupid shit like that. They found storm drains packed full of ballots, super illegal. There were armed MAGAts allowed to stand outside polling places and intimidated voters (extremely illegal, but Republicans have never cared about legality). They shortened when ppl could vote in areas they knew were leaning blue. They closed nunerous polling stations so ppl could get there to vote (illegal). Musk paid millions of dollars to get votes for trump and dangled a ""random"" voters getting a million bucks for voting for trump (also illegal). And then there's Orange Farquad stating his ""adviser"",Elon Musk, ""knows those computers better than anybody, all those computers, those vote counting computers, and we ended up winning Pennsylvania, like, in a landslide."", which has plenty of ppl side-eying. Numerous ppl in several elections offices across the country had been caught attempting to rig the election is his favor last time and they are all pretty much just as rabid for him this time.  I don't think most of it was due to rigging votes already counted but the closing polls, purging of registered voters off the rolls, negating votes due to 'signature inconsistency' (no one signs exactly the same twice), the ""losing"" of numerous votes, ballots thrown away/""lost"", and voters intimidation wwere the biggest factors aside from half the country simply not even caring enough to bother voting.    Trump is incredibly stupid but incredibly easy to stoke his ego, he's got LOTS of dirt in his background they could use to make him go along with whatever they want (like being Epstein's best buddy and he definitely hung with diddy a lot), get him to pretend to be your typical republican and basically be their talking head. He's certainly not making all of these EOs on his own accord...except the one where he tried to take away all native Americans' birthright citizenship was because he's hated us since at LEAST the 80s over some of our tribes having casinos and he's shit at owning casinos. It's on video. He went off in court.    His blatant hypocrisy, idiocy, lies, incoherent ramblings, racism, sexism, xenophobia, repeated adultery, openly wanting to bang his own daughter since she was an infant, his repeated bankruptcy, and golf addiction has just made nearly all republicans worship him more.
