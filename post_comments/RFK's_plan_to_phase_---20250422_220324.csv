They will not... well considering the same administration is dismantling quality, and safety regulations, and enforcement systems alongside government agencies involved in them. The FDA suspending milk quality testing as a consequence of all that.   The fun shit is that they are planning to transfer such regulatory, and inspection authority to local, and state level agencies. Which does not bode well for interstate commerce of various goods...

"I agree with everything you say but as someone who has had Fanta In Europe, that shit is nasty. They use real orange juice in it and it is more tart than sweet.

[This article cites a bunch of studies. ](https://dietitiansuccesscenter.com/health-implications-of-artificial-food-dyes-do-they-cause-hyperactivity-cancer-and-ibd/)  [Here is a study in their relation to ADHD](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9052604/#Sec4).  It isn't that the dyes are artificial but that many are made of things our bodies don't like like petroleum derivatives. When it comes to introducing things to our food supply that have never before been eaten we should study it first. Artificial dyes are entirely cosmetic so they are especially egregious.

"So I’m not supporting any of that, yes that’s wrong but the idea of removing dyes from packaged foods is a good thing. You can’t dismiss any good thing this administration does by saying “it’s just a distraction”, yes it doesn’t make up for all the other shit they’re doing but that doesn’t mean we critique good calls.

"Honestly. They don't know what the fuck they are doing with half of the things in play...  The food coloring thing is right in line with anti-fluoride bullshit from the crackpot conspiracy theorist side of talking points that conservatives have picked up on over the years. They don't actually care about any of the science behind any of it, nor do they understand it... it just sounds nice, and get certain supporters riled up. Which being said once conservatives pickup on a talking point they never let go of it even when it is no longer an issue, or when it has been proven to be pure bullshit from the start. Like the water saving toilets tirades.. sure back in the 80s they were bad, but not anymore. A ton of that is equal parts distraction, and delusion.  And I mean they never fucking let go of any of it.... just look at the anti-lbgt bathroom bills, and supporting argument they are pushing not.. its literally copy pasted from the civil rights era pro-segregation crud argumentation about supposed ""safety"" etc. ""America first"", MAGA? etc.. same fucking shit with much of it having roots in literal Nazi fucking rhetoric, and things that the KKK pushed like 100 years ago. ""States rights""... civil war era... and its goes on, and on, and on.  Then there is the intentional wrecking of things they dislike to the detriment of all... like regulatory agencies etc. Well harmful outside of the short term profits of the biggest friendly corporations.",Competitive_Oil_649,2025-04-23T17:00:44,1
"I'd even concede those those can be mitigating factors for corporate harm if the FDA and other government orgs weren't pretty much the only way we'd ever actually know there was a health issue in the first place.   If no one is recording botulism outbreaks across cities/counties/states, I think there's a good chance a few dozen people dying here or there woudln't even end up triggering a court case and stock dip, especially as it gets normalized in these agencies' absence.

If you change the rules but remove the mechanisms and systems in place to detect people breaking the rules and punishing people who break those rules   Then you haven't actually changed reality   You just changed some words on a bit of paper while the companies involved carry on regardless   You have accomplished nothing except looking good  Edit to add   Do you honestly think that without any detection or enforcement large corporate entities will change their behaviour just because of a rule change?
