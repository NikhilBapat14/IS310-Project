Bad attitude towards this.  You SHOULD care.  And something SHOULD happen.    The corruption is actually getting exposed. So something is happening. Hopefully all of the funding cuts will continue and accountability will increase and be more transparent.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-07T11:53:49,8

Im glad all these scams are losing funding. I expect nothing to happen to any of them and fully expect these scams to be back in full swing in a few years once Trump is gone.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-05-07T12:05:44,1
