"“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump said in a social media post as he flew back to the United States after attending Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, where he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia.  “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions?” Too many people are dying!!!” Trump wrote.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T09:47:41,239
How long can Russia economically continue this? That's the key question really.,krazyellinas23,2025-04-26T14:53:56,71

I've been saying it ever since before the election: Trump will be much harder on Russia than the Dems would've - once he realizes they're trying to play him.   These last few months will be like a fever dream by the end of the year if Putin keeps being a silly goose.,SpaceBownd,2025-04-26T15:08:24,-37
Is there a video of Trump saying that? I don’t trust AP cat blog. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-26T10:16:32,-151
">“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,”   Killing Ukrainian civilians and demoralizing them in hopes that they push for surrender or a change in leadership is the reason.  Putin wants to take over Ukraine and isn't interested in peace.  This isn't that fucking complicated.  >Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia.  Sounds nice, but there's nothing meaningful left to sanction. The only option in that route is to start threatening our allies again and force them to stop buying Russian oil.  That'll cause oil prices to spike globally, hurt our allies, and benefit India and China as they get even more Russian oil at even better prices.  The economic warfare options have all been played out.  >“It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions?” Too many people are dying!!!” Trump wrote.  It bothers me that he hasn't figured this out yet.  Putin.  Doesn't. Want Peace.  He wants Ukraine and around five other nations.  Shit, Moldova was on the maps from day one of the invasion, and while he isn't following it to the letter, he subscribes to Duigin's worldview on what Russia NEEDS to control to survive.",cathbadh,2025-04-26T14:28:45,130
Years is my guess.   Especially if they do delay tactics and just try to hold the line for a while.,UpvoteMagnet99,2025-04-26T16:26:47,42

"Russia's oil was never sanctioned under Biden. Europe has been buying it en masse.  I don't think Trump restarted those sanctions yet, probably because of the attempt at diplomacy first. So that would put those on the table. And that's a huge one.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-26T20:38:12,5

">Russia's oil was never sanctioned under Biden. Europe has been buying it en masse.  Outright untrue. The US participated in the g7 price caps and sanctions in 2022 and 3023,and Biden did some last minute ones in January.  Most of what Europe has been buying is through third parties, and is expected. A total freeze of oil sales would result on higher prices everywhere.... Except China, who would just get richer and stronger.",cathbadh,2025-04-27T06:30:17,16
