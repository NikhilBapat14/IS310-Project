She was literally thrown in jail because she did something Drumpf didn't like  We are in a full dictatorship,Burner_Account_14934,2025-05-01T18:37:30,28
She let him use a door that led to the same hallway ICE was waiting in. ICE then rode the same elevator the man used (yes at the same time the man and his lawyer used it).,Koochikins,2025-05-01T18:45:38,18

She can't adequately do her job as a judge while defending herself from the Orange Mussolini. So it makes sense for her to not hear cases while it's happening.,TimothyMimeslayer,2025-05-01T19:06:46,6

Democrats being weak and incompetent what else is new. They have the majority on the Wisconsin supreme Court and side with the gestapo. Party is truly controlled opposition and an enemy of the working class.,PeakOk3826,2025-05-01T18:37:40,-8
Why don’t republicans want victims to get justice?  They’d rather set the offender free in another country.,Inner_Mortgage_8294,2025-05-01T19:14:47,-1
"There was a member of the arrest team positioned away from the group & dressed as a civilian. He or she remained in the hallway as others on the arrest team were escorted to the Chief Judge's office.   >Dugan “demanded” that the agents “report to” the chief judge’s chambers. Judge A then escorted five of the six agents—not DEA Agent B, who had been “inconspicuously” seated away from the rest of the group and “had not been recognized” as an agent—to the chief judge’s office, while Dugan returned to her courtroom.  Sounds like the precaution of sending him through the private exit is actually what got him caught.",TheManQueef,2025-05-02T00:26:19,3
Thats so crazy the judge scooby-doo the ice agents,mvs2527,2025-05-01T19:32:30,3
"No, it won't. You're not understanding what happened. Our court in WI is 4-3 liberal. Suspend in a legal context is not a punishment. It literally says in the article it's an administrative decision, not disciplinary.   >Court officials emphasized that this is not a disciplinary action but an administrative one.  Any defendant that showed up in her court and had a guilty verdict could appeal based her current legal status. It's in both hers and the public's best interest that her cases are currently reassigned to another judge, and in order to do that, she needs to be suspended.   It maintains the integrity of the entire judicial system to suspend a judge facing a legal proceeding. I'd much rather have them suspend her with the precedence they'd suspend any judge facing a legal proceeding, than not suspending her and allowing precedence to leave an actual corrupt judge facing a legal proceeding on the bench.   If the charges are dismissed, she would be back on the bench immediately. Again, this is administrative. It has no disciplinary effect or goes on a record of any kind.",undercurrents,2025-05-01T19:03:03,17
"The suspension is correct, and nobody should see her suspension as an acknowledgment that the charges have any merit. It's unreasonable to expect her to perform her duties as a judge while facing criminal charges, even if those charges are bogus. Suspension is probably standard policy when a judge is charged, and for good reason.",enjoycarrots,2025-05-01T19:56:13,7
The law is still the law. She can not hear cases while dealing with her own case. Should they ignore the law because it suits them?,DisMFer,2025-05-01T19:17:19,3
"You realize if they didn’t suspend her best case she’d run through her vacation days, worst case she’d have to continue to take case while also dealing with her own case.",Open_Chemistry_3300,2025-05-02T07:01:10,0
"The Scooby Doo gang could have caught the guy easier. Two of them were high all the time and another two were just sneaking off every episode to make out. and yes, I am implying Velma did all the work.

"it is still a burden for both her and the court at large to deal with, which can absolutely have a chilling effect on other judges behavior if they dont want to also deal with such a situation.",Hamwise420,2025-05-01T19:24:25,4
"""The law is the law"". Apparently not. In the reality I'm living in there is lawlessness and might. The case itself is illegitimate so is the law the law or is the law whatever Trump says it is?",PeakOk3826,2025-05-01T19:21:29,1
"The chilling behavior is that of ICE. Not the Supreme Court who is not playing favorites by suspending a judge facing legal proceedings, and whose cases could end up getting appealed and overturned.   The Supreme Court is NOT making a ruling on her innocence or guilt. It's upholding the integrity of the court by temporarily suspending a judge from presiding over cases that could later be challenged. And once again, if you don't want an actual criminal or corrupt judge still sitting on the bench while awaiting criminal proceedings in the future, you apply the same rule to all.   What the Supreme Court is doing is correct. They are not weighing in on her guilt or innocence. A judge is facing legal proceedings- they are temporarily removing cases from their docket til it's resolved.",undercurrents,2025-05-01T19:38:40,7
So your argument is that breaking the law is not itself an immoral act to condemn it only matters if the law can be broken by people you like?,DisMFer,2025-05-01T20:44:16,2
"You're reading an attribution of blame on the Supreme Court when that's not been necessarily implied. The ordeal she is going through, including the suspension, will have a chilling effect. The Supreme Court didn't cause that situation, and I don't see anybody you are replying to suggest that they did. The suggestion is only that the fact that she has to go through this will have a chilling effect on other judges.. which it will, as is the intent.",enjoycarrots,2025-05-01T19:53:54,0
By this logic why could a bad faith executive branch not bring forth charges against any pesky dissenting judges? If mere charges are enough for suspension what power does the judicial have as a check and balance? Also from my understanding charging a judge in this manner is very not normal.,PeakOk3826,2025-05-01T21:35:47,1
Because that's literally what this article is about and what OP's comment is about.,undercurrents,2025-05-01T20:10:46,1
It is not but again she's not disbarred or forbidden from taking her job back up after the case is dismissed. She's simply not allowed to take new cases until she's no longer in the middle of a massive legal battle.,DisMFer,2025-05-01T21:46:11,1
