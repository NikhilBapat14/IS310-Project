"A General Strike requires advance planning, especially saving up to weather the likely outcome for many of us: losing our jobs and our health insurance.  Yes, a General Strike needs to happen. But, no, it's not going to happen soon. And it'll never happen if we don't start organizing the strike fund many of us will require.",MMessinger,2025-04-16T07:25:17,40
If you can't even get voters who agree with you to show up to vote how do you expect to convince them to stop working for months?,darwinn_69,2025-04-16T08:45:18,16
"A general strike is a widespread work stoppage across many industries, usually organized by labor unions, to protest political or social issues. In Germany, a famous example is the 1920 general strike that successfully opposed the right-wing Kapp Putsch and defended the democratic Weimar Republic.  The Kapp Putsch of March 1920 was a right-wing attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic. Although the putschists occupied Berlin, they failed to gain widespread support. In response, the government called for a general strike, which was massively supported by workers across the country. Public services, transport, and industry came to a halt, effectively paralyzing the coup. Isolated and unable to govern, Wolfgang Kapp resigned after just four days, and the democratic government was restored.",Morgentau7,2025-04-16T01:29:04,12
"If Obama was doing the shit this administration is doing, the people who stormed the capital would have stormed the White House. No evidence of a steal, you want to stage a coup but evidence of mass fuckery and you sit on your hands?!",Blackbond007,2025-04-16T11:29:36,10

"Perhaps 25% are 100% committed to MAGA fascism.  Possibly 25% are completely opposed.  The other 50% is nowhere near convinced that the solution to everything is to give up their job, home, healthcare, education, and everything else.  An unfortunate number couldn’t be convinced to vote against Trump and what he represents, and too many would still prefer any outcome other than Democrats being returned to leadership roles.",AntifascistAlly,2025-04-16T07:51:48,3
"Real Americans who value the freedoms allowed by our Constitution need to have their own day at the Capitol.  We need to peacefully fill to capacity the Capitol building and the grounds outside with the message “Impeach it!”  If our numbers aren’t shown to the Republican leadership things will never change, right or wrong doesn’t register with them, losing an election does.",Intrepid_Blue122,2025-04-16T08:21:32,3

All they know and support is someone who in their mind will oppress and exert authority over people they perceive as weaker.

"Savings doesn't make a difference in a general strike unless you have tins of goods saved. If no one is working nothing will be produced, and nothing will be available to buy.  That is the point.  The point is that you decide you and your family's welfare is worth the sacrifice.  It will never happen though.",veed_vacker,2025-04-16T09:17:20,5

"Back then? Yes, but things were different back then.   The „New Government“ wasnt structured enough and had to step down days later cause basically all bureaucrats and everyone involved with the government as well as the entire country refused to work with them. It took the rightwing forces 13 years afterwards to regroup and install Hitler.  The Republicans sadly have dug in so deep into the government already that its like with cancer which spread too much: You couldn’t remove them anymore without causing permanent damage.",Morgentau7,2025-04-17T01:40:34,1
