"It's irresponsible of any media outlet to imply that this is all business-as-usual-just-a-wee-bit-stricter, and here's our little list of rules that you can follow to protect yourself. It's laughable.  The system is now run at the capricious whims of the various psychos and ideologues in the White House. The law will not protect you. The best bet for individuals from outside the U.S. is not to visit it under any circumstances, and it may be wise for even some U.S. citizens to avoid leaving the country and thus having to face being let back in.",Logical_Hare,2025-04-22T20:47:44,7

"I'm a native born American citizen, married to another one and we aren't even traveling outside of blue states in the forseeable future.   But in all seriousness, a lawyer friend advised us that if we traveled overseas to make sure we deleted any social media apps from our phone before going through US customs ... just in case.
