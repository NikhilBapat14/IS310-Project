"Evidently Pam feels that with the staggering amount of lives saved, 258 Million, we can safely  stop giving [Narcan](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-narcan-overdose-grant-b2739727.html) to our first responders. Even though credited with saving countless lives, evidently we don’t need it anymore.

"He's the kind of guy that your parents teach you not to be.  Everything you learn growing up about respecting other people and following rules, the guy does the complete opposite.  Then you see people in public like law enforcement or religious folks circling around him,  like he's this incredible man.   It's baffling how far everything has fallen and how weird everything is now. He's a guy that literally stole money from a charity to buy a painting of himself,  he had a fake school where he had to pay a 25 million dollar fine, he cheated on all his wives with his next wife, he nailed a p -  star while his new wife was home nursing a newborn baby",[deleted],2025-05-02T08:17:41,22

"Those are all the reasons why the boot licking cult worship him, though. He gets away doing whatever he wants to whoever he wants, he's as brash and verbally abusive to anyone he wants, he's survived multiple bankruptcies (gotten away with never paying who he owes)... They see who they personally want to be for their own lives in him. Sure, they'll never have the amount of money in their hands that he's had, but they can relate to being as rude as they want to pretty much anyone without consequence from society.",_C2J_,2025-05-02T09:08:30,13

"You know, the funny thing is in high school, he was also the guy that I despised most and yet remained constantly befuddled about how he would seemingly lead students and teachers around by the nose.    An absolute bully, a liar, rich, a braggart, stupid, no morals and yet all of the popular kids, the kids from families  with money, the pretty girls, the cool boys all fucking loved him.  He would say something awful about the kids in the school with disabilities and all the other cool kids would laugh.  He would lie to teachers and not get punished and would cheat on homework or research projects and then brag about getting the A and even about how he cheated to get the A, so long as a teacher wasn't around to hear.  And at home your parents would lecture you about how you should be moral and kind and truthful and you would go to (insert your religion of choice) and hear the same lessons, and then you would go to school and get the same lessons from the teachers yet again and see posters reaffirming the lessons every where in school.  The whole while, utterly befuddled about why after being told these things over and over and over, this guy does the opposite, so do all his friends, and they are all at the top of the social ladder in school and worshipped by all the other kids with less social capital but *desperate* to build more.  And no one ever did anything.  I still don't understand who could possibly support someone like that.",AdventurousSeaSlug,2025-05-02T20:51:16,1
