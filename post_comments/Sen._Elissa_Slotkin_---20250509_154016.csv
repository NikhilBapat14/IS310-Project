"Hello democrat strategists who want to try making a corporate/isareal friendly the face of the party. You are the problem. You are the reason the democrats let fascists waltz to power. Because you want to manufacture democrats that fit your goals, instead of democrats that serve the people.",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-09T15:53:17,14

The establishment is trying really hard to shove her down our throats. She is the problem with the dems. It’s only about fundraising and not activism. Mayor Pete is a much better communicator. I see him as the corporate candidate to beat.,Unusual_Ant_5309,2025-05-09T16:05:20,3

This. 👆🏽  Do not promote reactionary Democrats. That’s why we’re in the situation.,SnowSandRivers,2025-05-09T15:56:36,5
"> You are the reason the democrats let fascists waltz to power.  The Democrats aren't your mommy or daddy, stop begging them to help you or convince others to vote correctly. Anybody who had the option of voting and voted Trump or refused to vote owns this just as much if not more than the Democrats do.",Omegoa,2025-05-09T16:17:10,-1
Slotkin has vote for almost every Trump appointee. She’s a former CIA spook who thinks the Democratic Party is too woke.,SnowSandRivers,2025-05-09T15:56:07,10
So are a ton of other democrats who are not corporate cutouts being backed by the worst possible interests. I would rather hear from them,TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-09T15:57:03,7

"They'll both be run, probably even bring Warren back and give her another Super PAC (at least she already reneged on everything she ever claimed to believe in last time). Maybe if he's not in jail for fraud yet Musk can foot the bill this time instead of Machin's epipen price-gouging daughter.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-05-09T16:35:53,1
Wrong. The democrats are the opposition party. So by definition they do need to do something. That’s the whole point of them.  Otherwise they serve no purpose.,Key-Leader8955,2025-05-10T07:24:21,0
"Why should they care? They're all rich, mostly white people who occasionally try to do something good but will be fine no matter what happens. You're as dumb as the MAGAs if you think they're going to, or are even supposed to, fight for you when you won't fight for yourself.  Edit to directly address what you said in clear terms: ""The democrats are the opposition party. So by definition they do need to do something. That’s the whole point of them. Otherwise they serve no purpose."" Have you seen them do much in the way of meaningful opposition? The point of the current Democratic Party is to protect corporate interests, and while the corpos are displeased by the wanton chaos of the Trump admin, they seem to be fine playing the waiting game/placating Trump to get exemptions. The Democrats are serving their purpose just fine, it's simply that you dont' understand what their purpose is. And they get to cater to corpos because voters are too unengaged to realize they should primary the old neo-liberals running the show to get new blood into the party, and so it all circles back to the voters. This Democratic Party is the one the voters voted for. This President of the United States is the one the voters voted for. They did not walk in their on their own, the voters put them there. Fool the voters once, shame on the politician; fool the voters for 30 - 50 years (depending on party), that's on the voter.",Omegoa,2025-05-10T11:00:50,1
