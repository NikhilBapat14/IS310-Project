"  >""The major problem, one of the major problems, for there are several, with governing people is that of who you get to do it. Or, rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well known and much lamented fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job.

I called this after the election. The whole DOGE thing was a front for the biggest data theft in history. I don't think Trump or anyone in his orbit understands what has happened.   Elon and his buddy Peter Thiel now have all the government data they could scoop up which they can now cross reference with the immense private data from Palantir.  This was the real goal for Elon all along. He does not care about cutting costs at all. The data is worth untold billions of dollars.,MasterK999,2025-04-30T22:12:37,4

I think education on why we're here is important and that requires calling out the pitfalls of our system. Doesn't help to not talk about it and bring awareness.
