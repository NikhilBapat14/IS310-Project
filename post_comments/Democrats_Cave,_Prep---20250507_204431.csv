"Absolute embarrassment from crypto shills. They could have made their amendment a precondition to pass, but instead they're allowing it as a stand alone amendment that will get zero republican support.  The nine democrats going along with this are enabling the most obvious corruption possible of our elected officials.",Pike_Gordon,2025-05-07T20:46:25,97
"As a case in point, supporters of the End Crypto Corruption Act include the Democratic sponsors of the GENIUS Act, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), along with senators seen as favorable to crypto bills like Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI).    Elissa Slotkin at it again, helping Republicans. They are 100% going to run her CIA ass in 2028.",GargamelTakesAll,2025-05-07T20:56:33,43
Chuck Schumer is a collaborator he's fine with all of this. As long as Israel gets money and Palestinian protestors are thrown in gulags he will sign off on anything. The dems need to get rid oh him and Jeffries they are both worthless stooges,DarkRepresentative63,2025-05-07T21:00:18,45

"Unfortunately you can’t fix stupid. So far the caucus has done nothing to address, stop, curb or condemn what the republicans are doing.   This begs the question of why we would ever support them if they cannot come to a consensus and stop the destruction of the USA as a whole.   This is despicable and should raise everyones eyebrows as this os basically a death sentence to the USA based on their inability to do anything… even speak about what is going on. Just silence?   Kinda hard to get behind a group like that?",BungleBunny,2025-05-07T21:08:47,8

"How Slotkin votes should come as no surprise. If anyone thought she was going to be anything but a Republican-lite, they weren't looking at her House record.

"For general elections, yes Blue No Matter Who is absolutely what has to be followed. If you want to pull the party one way or the other, you do that in the primary process. That's how Republicans became this insane, their primaries got highjacked by the inmates so they started running the asylum.  That's basically Ranked Choice Voting, without requiring a complete overhaul of the American electoral system that is unlikely to ever happen. But it requires people to actually pay attention to primary elections and not just sleep through the entire political process, just to show up on election day in November.",CrashB111,2025-05-08T00:52:59,7
"Vote blue no matter who is correct we are trying to defend against fascism and the first step is taking back power. That in mind the Democratic primary isn't going to be rigged whoever wins will get the majority/ plurality of the party on their side.

The democrats will play dirty to get their candidate through the primaries and push this “blue no matter who” bullshit on us meanwhile the party will not fundamentally change. They’ve done this the last three cycles and nothing ever changes.,PandaBearGarage,2025-05-08T01:24:04,1
"that's the argument that is really distressing, you're admitting they're not good choices, just better than the evil fascists.  tell me more about how they're not gonna rig the primary, cause i'd love to see that actually play out, but historically it's not accurate.",LURKER21D,2025-05-08T12:23:23,1

The Democrats played dirty by having that candidate win the most votes. You know how primaries..,DeadNeko,2025-05-08T05:59:03,2
"They've not rigged a single primary in my lifetime, I still can't predict the future, but if your definition of rigging is that you preferred candidate doesn't win then you may be sorely disappointed.  Objectively Biden was a good choice we got more passed then any president since FDR. he was only a bad choice if you don't care about infrastructure, if you don't care about healthcare, if you didn't care about climate change, if you didn't care about workers rights, if you didn't care about trying bust monopolies, if you didn't care about minorities and treating people with dignity. if you don't care about any of those things then why are you here?  If you did care about those things please explain to me how he wasn't a good choice. He wasn't perfect, but no one would be. I would vote for biden happily again if he was younger. I feel like people who claim the democrats aren't good choices, with some exceptions like maybe sinema or Manchin who were already pariahs, have such unrealistic expectations that anything short of an authoritarian wouldn't be good enough for them.",DeadNeko,2025-05-08T13:14:01,1
"Please don’t act like there’s not well documented evidence of Donna Brazile and wasserman schulz tipping the scales in favor of Hillary in 2016. Or how before the South Carolina primary in 2020 when Bernie was in the lead every moderate dem bailed out and endorsed Biden, except Warren, splitting the progressive vote and consolidating the moderate vote for Biden. Just cause someone can’t see how calculated it is doesn’t mean this isn’t happening.",PandaBearGarage,2025-05-08T06:15:19,0
"> Please don’t act like there’s not well documented evidence of Donna Brazile and wasserman schulz tipping the scales in favor of Hillary in 2016.  I will, because there's not.  Did the people in the Democratic Party leadership, prefer the candidate that was also a longtime party member over the candidate that had never been part of the party before that election? Sure.  Do they actually take any action to influence the result of the race? No.  It's not illegal or improper for people to have preferences, they are people after all. And before you start whining about ""Super Delegates"", Hillary still wins the primary even if none of them voted. Because she beat Sanders by millions of votes.  >Or how before the South Carolina primary in 2020 when Bernie was in the lead every moderate dem bailed out and endorsed Biden, except Warren, splitting the progressive vote and consolidating the moderate vote for Biden.  So you mean that the majority of Democratic Primary voters, wanted a Moderate candidate and the only route Bernie had was not to win actual majorities in the primary but to slip through by pluralities? Sounds like the majority of primary voters got the candidate they wanted, by all of the moderates dropping out instead of splitting the ticket against each other.",CrashB111,2025-05-08T08:04:41,1
"You realize that even if you combine Warren and Bernie in the actual results Biden still wins by more than +10 or are you bad at math? People regularly drop out in primaries when they have no chance of winning in order to secure a position in government. The only moderate besides Biden who had a chance was Pete and he didn't have the black vote and was dead to rights on super Tuesday. All of this was not only known at the time but there were media companies talking about it before it happened because it was expected. But the worst part is even if everything you said was true and it isn't. That would still mean that the majority of the party wanted a fucking moderate your just mad that they didn't split their vote so the progressive minority won instead. That's not illegal, that's not shameful, that's not even unfair. That's just politics if you want to win convince the Democratic base your correct. It's shameful that Bernies legacy of fighting is being carried by cry babies. The men marched for civil rights only to watch his supporters be mad they can't win a popularity contest.",DeadNeko,2025-05-08T06:25:44,0
You’re going to ignore the DNC giving Hillary the debate questions before her debate with Sanders? That’s material support to one candidate.,PandaBearGarage,2025-05-08T16:22:47,0
"You act like a debate is a fucking SAT exam or something that you can ""cheat"" at. Like there's only one correct answer to any given statement, not that most questions asked are open ended and designed to get the candidate to voice their views on a topic.",CrashB111,2025-05-08T16:29:03,1
"Al Gore got sent debate plans in the mail and sent it to the FBI, like he was supposed to do. He understood that accepting it would be cheating. You can absolutely cheat at a debate.

"Any candidate and campaign staff worth their salt, is going to know what debate questions they are likely to be asked. It's not some kind of pop quiz where you just have no time at all to prepare.  Is it a slight advantage? Sure.  Is it enough to justify Bernie Bros still bitching about things being ""rigged"" a decade later? Fuck no.   You sound like Donald Trump saying anything he doesn't like is rigged against him.",CrashB111,2025-05-08T16:58:50,1
