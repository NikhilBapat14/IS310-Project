"Given the FDA cuts, any new parents that can afford it should probably start buying European formulas. Hard to trust the American brands right now given the lack of oversight.",supes1,2025-04-23T09:54:02,11

"Car seats especially shouldn’t be acquired secondhand, given how you can’t tell if they were involved in an accident (plus the materials deteriorate in hot cars and sunshine).  But if Ballerina Farm can drive a tractor with one of her toddlers in her lap, then who needs car seats?",UFOsBeforeBros,2025-04-23T12:01:49,5

"Don't worry moms, an expensive smooth stone from the alternative nature medic pharmacy will cure any and all problems your baby may have!    Also, make sure to baptize him and take your baby to church every Sunday! That way, he will always stay healthy, and there will not be a need for baby products in the long run!   It will also thankfully cure his autism, if he has it.  Love you, moms! ❤️☺️",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-23T10:28:00,1
"Being a parent is an expensive experience. A stroller alone can easily cost over a thousand dollars, not to mention the constant new clothing as children grow, formula and food for them to eat, and the rising costs (and challenge to find) of childcare. Unfortunately, there's no reprieve in sight, especially thanks to the [new tariffs](https://www.wired.com/tag/tariffs/).  While there have been delays on some tariffs hitting areas like consumer technology and cars, and tariffs for several countries have pauses until July, tariffs for China have already kicked in at [up to 145 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/economy/china-tariffs-145-percent.html). A huge percentage of products like car seats and [strollers](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-stroller-for-kids/) are made in China, putting them immediately under the heat of higher prices. “We’re already seeing a significant—and potentially devastating—impact on the cost of baby items,” says Natalie Gordon, founder and CEO of [Babylist](https://www.babylist.com/index).

I want to know what kind of luxury stroller costs over a grand.  I had one of those two kid strollers and I don't think it was over $300.,Parlett316,2025-04-23T10:00:37,1
I just bought a new jogging stroller for like $110. I have 0 clue what brand of stroller you’re buying but no one SHOULD be buying a $1000+ stroller,BelleMorosi,2025-04-23T12:03:16,1
Nuna is one brand. My wife and I bought a Graco one that we love and it wasn’t more than $250-$300.,twombles21,2025-04-23T10:54:14,1
"Uppababy vista is like 900. Whether it’s worth it depends on who you are, but if you’ve ever used one you get why it’s more money. It’s like the difference between driving a Kia soul and a Mercedes.",eastjebip,2025-04-23T14:23:53,1
Never heard of that brand until just now. Looks bad ass. I imagine it keeps the resale value too.,Parlett316,2025-04-23T14:26:25,1
