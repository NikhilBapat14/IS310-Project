"If they can reset the rent when an individual moves out, doesn’t that defeat the purpose of the law?  Why would the owner keep long term tenants when it would be more beneficial and more profitable to do short term rental agreements so you can keep raising the price of the unit above the 7%-10%?",Peacefulgamer2023,2025-05-08T01:02:44,14
Unfortunately because of this law my property management company sent me a notice at the beginning of the month. The notice said because of the new law they were forced to raise my rent before it passed and would be required yearly to do so. I know they are lying.       it just shows how scummy these property management companies are.  After this increase my rent will have now increased 130% over the last 11 years.  now it will increase 7% a year the max i am sure.,sedatedlife,2025-05-07T22:34:07,20

"A rent cap law without a mechanism to force construction companies to BUILD housing will just mean that there will be shortages (worse than what we already have).  There has to be something that measures the amount of housing on the market, measures the demand for housing, calculates the shortfall, and then FORCES builders to build enough housing to meet the shortfall.  \---  You may say that the market should determine this, but as we can see... it's not.",Joadzilla,2025-05-08T06:06:47,2

"My auntie owned and managed a pair of eight-plex apartments. It was a job, and she knew all the tenants, and when they needed something, they talked to her, and she arranged the maintenance, with trades workers she'd known and worked with for decades. She was always dealing with the apartments.   My grandfather did something similar, before I was born. It was a lot of work and he sold it!    I just wonder how many apartments used to be run this way. And now, how are they run?    Some people act like all landlords are evil, but I don't think so. They do a job. Or, they are supposed to... ",Blagnet,2025-05-08T02:31:32,8

"Because there is some turn around time built in to doing a rent increase that way. A month of no rent outweighs the rent increase profitability.  So if I rent my place out for $2k a month, and I want to increase it by 10%, I would make $200 more a month. That means to ‘break even’ in a new 12 month lease, I would need less than a 1 month turn around. That’s with a 10% increase — the max allowed by this law.   *Renting a year at $2000:*  >$2k a month * 12 = $24000  *If I leave it empty one month and bump rent 10% next month:*  >$2k a month * 11 = $22000  *Then, the next year:*  >$2200 * 12 = $26400  *So over 2 years, if I take month off rent I took in:*  >$22000 + $26400 = $48600  *If I just kept my original tenants I took in:*  >$24000 * 2 (years) = $48000  So by taking one month off of rent, then raising rent by 10%, I made $600. That’s $50 a month. I broke even 10 months in.  Sounds great, but…  That all assumes that I will be able to clean the place, do any needed maintenance, get it back on the market, and have someone sign a lease and move in, all within a month. That’s easier to do if I can market it in advance (while the current tenant is there), but still a fairly fast turnaround considering the risk is being on the hook for the entire mortgage without support from rental income. And my place is 10% more expensive than it was.   Some will take that risk and some won’t. Those that do have to compete extra hard to beat out the places that are not raising by that much.  So maybe I do a less drastic increase in rent to help reduce the risk of not finding a tenant quickly   But at 7%, my monthly profit goes up only $140 a month. That means I would need to rent for a lot longer to break even.  *We don’t need to do all the math again:*  ($200-$40)*48 months = $2880  That means I would need to rent 14 months after a one month break to ‘break even’ with a 7% raise  None if this factors in the costs of getting a new lease signed, showing the place, repairs, cleaning, carpet replacement, etc. That could be anywhere from $500-a few thousand depending on how much you DIY or contract out — keeping in mind DIY generally means longer downtime and therefore less income.  So the decision has to be, do I lose money for ~2 years to force people out, and then take on all the risk of a new tenant (assuming I currently have a good tenant).   Or do I keep my current tenant at their current rent, and have less competition because a few others have raised their rents, making my place more desirable.  Again, some will take that risk and some wont.  But if a lot of people don’t take it, now I’m trying to rent my place at 7-10% higher than what’s around it. So my risk is even higher because I have one of the more expensive places to rent.  So it’s really not as simple as “Why not just kick them out and raise the rent”. In many cases, it is cheaper to keep your current tenants on their current rent than to gamble on new ones. I negotiated my apartment rent down in a HCOL area using this logic:  “Hey I noticed my rent is the same as your market rent for these apartments. But as people move out, you are renovating them. Since my place is not renovated, I’d like to request a lower rate, or a renovation.”  I said all that knowing that it was more profitable for them to keep me at my current rate (as opposed to increasing my rent on my re-signed lease) and renovate when I leave. It was cheaper to keep my as a current tenant at a lower rate than it is to fix up my old apartment to be competitive at a higher rate (and take a month or so off the market).  Rent will still go up eventually either way. But the factors above will lower the increases to well below 7-10% per tenant and my prediction is that they will simply continue to rise at the rate they have been. Rent control is generally a stupid idea IMO (let’s incentivize people to never move ever during a housing shortage *cough cough* NYC).   But it’s not going to suddenly be viable to expect 7-10% increases in most cases.",DClawsareweirdasf,2025-05-08T05:00:22,8
"In California, one of the few states to have a rent cap law, there are safeguards in place for that.   A lease renewal cannot be denied unless the owner of the building is personally moving into the unit, or the property requires structural repairs or renovations that would render it inhabitable.  Additionally, landlords are by law only allowed to increase rent once in any 12 month period. Short term leases do not get around that limitation. For example, if a tenant signs a 6 month lease and renews it twice before they move out, rent can only be increased once.   Tenants have a lot of rights here.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-05-08T06:04:43,3

"I'd argue property management isn't even the problem. It's that their goal isn't to provide a housing service, it's to make money. We need to limit predators in industries.. everyone deserves to make a company that provides a service, but people who blatantly provide inferior service because they can shouldn't be allowed to exist. We should subsidize their competition.  Unless we give everyone a house, which we can't, we need landlords to exist. But we need people that have their communities in mind as well as their pocket.  I help make decisions for our humane society occasionally, and we take on financial burden we cannot afford all the time because our mission is the animals. We will figure out the money later or we'll go out of business but we cannot deny our mission.",DroDameron,2025-05-08T06:16:53,-1
