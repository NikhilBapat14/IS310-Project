">DOJ civil rights lawyer  These are some of the scummiest lawyers out there. Cannot overstate how much damage these people have done to America via ""disparate impact"" lawsuits.  Employers can't legally do straightforward intelligence/competence testing as often as they'd like to, so they're forced to ask for college diplomas as a proxy. This is why our college system is so busted with outrageous costs and degree inflation.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-29T16:03:57,7

"If they really feel so strongly about the cause, shouldn't they be staying where they could actually do something about it?  Or are you saying it was all moral grandstanding because it was a paycheck at the end of the day?  I'm SHOCKED. Well not that shocked.",MikoMiky,2025-04-29T15:47:47,4
