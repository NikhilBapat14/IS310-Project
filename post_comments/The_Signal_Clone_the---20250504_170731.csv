"I certainly do not expect Republicans to stop being hypocritical, unpatriotic pieces of shit, but I do wonder if anyone in the media has any regrets about how they covered Clinton's private server. Even at the time, it was very clear to anyone who bothered to learn the details (which many in the media did not) that it was not a real scandal. It was just the best thing Congressional Republicans could come up with after abusing their power for years to keep Clinton under investigation and hurt her chances to win an election. But Clinton's private server caused zero problems, no one broke any laws, and since Clinton and her team always handled classified/sensitive information properly, there really aren't any hypothetical problems it could have caused, even in a worst case scenario.   But for almost two years, the private server was treated like the biggest political scandal in the world, even though the candidate she was running against was literally working with the Russian government to get elected. And now we now that the Trump Administration was using an unapproved third party app to discuss the most sensitive things imaginable, and we've just moved on.   Honestly, Hillary Clinton should be allowed to do a few mass shootings with no repercussions.

"To be fair, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with Signal itself; audits have shown it to be consistently bulletproof. The issue is they’re using personal devices to discuss classified actions.

Anybody else doing the same thing he, Hegseth, et. al. were caught doing would be facing down federal prosecution.  Edit:   In addition, Signal's E2EE (which this is built off of) is not bullet-proof, it is not even close.  Because it allows for a user to connect additional devices to their account so that a chat can be accessed across the account instead of isolating it to the device.  And hackers have shown multiple examples of using that feature to craft an undetected man-in-the-middle attack.  This app was added via the Federal Information Security Management Act, but it was never approved for communications among people who have access to classified information.  It is silly for a person to claim that the Signal protocol is secure for classified government communication when the attackers targeting it are hostile foreign actors with orders of magnitude more resources than the private firm that maintains the app's security.",code_archeologist,2025-05-05T11:47:48,3

This is also done for the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, which authorizes the agencies to explore third party communication vendors for lower risk traffic.  The federal government for example owns a large block of Slack licenses, including an isolated set of distribution servers known as GovSlack as part of that program...

This 👆. She used Bill Clinton’s Sciff in their home too. She followed the same protocol as every other Sec of State including republican Colin Powell. Total hypocrisy and a double standard.

"Cause for what? At worst, mis-labeling communications only reto-actively marked as classified?  She herself was pretty famously not technologically savvy. I can almost guarantee she wasn’t directing anyone concerning the particulars of how her communications worked. So yeah, the team that set it up was lax in a certain security standard sense, but there was nothing at that time that made having that server illegal, and the same set up had been used before by a former Sec of State. There was precedent for using that set up.   The report stated  ""there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information”  Edited to add… don’t get me wrong.

"Conservatives do not actually believe anything.  They will stake out a position on an issue, claim it is the most important thing in the world to them, say they're a one-issue voter on it, bludgeon you over the head with it, and then abandon it completely the second it becomes politically inconvenient.  Where are all those Tea Party assholes? Why aren't they shutting everything down now that Trump is completely fucking the economy?  It was the only thing they cared about a couple of years ago.  Where are they now, besides on their knees for Trump?  Or the old white men shouting red-faced on the news every night in the late 90s explaining that no conservative Christian in this country would ever cast a vote for a man who cheated on his wife.  Where the fuck did they go when Trump cheated on all three wives and had paid sex with a pornstar?  Oh, they all lined up to spit-shine his shoes?  How about the ""free speech absolutists""?  Why aren't they out in force now that Trump is locking people up and deporting them for protesting against the military actions of *a different country*?  They're all groveling.  They don't give a shit.  *They've never cared about anything at all* except for hurting the most people possible.  Look at the policies they champion. Look at their effects.  Go back 40 years and look at every single policy Republicans have ever proposed, pushed, or passed.    They are anti-humanity.  Private for-profit prisons. Environmental destruction. Pointless wars. Eliminating basic human rights. Eliminating programs that fund cancer research.  Eliminating education. Eliminating programs that feed hungry children. Attempting to control even the basic elements of how you perceive your own identity.    Conservatives will *always* back any policy or stand behind any candidate that  causes the most suffering and misery for the most people.  They seek to undermine human dignity, human happiness, and human life at every possible turn.  > I mean, has there ever been an organization in human history that is dedicated, with such commitment, to the destruction of organized human life on Earth? Not that I’m aware of. Is the Republican organization—I hesitate to call it a party—committed to that? Overwhelmingly. There isn’t even any question about it. >>-Noam Chomsky",ThatsMyAppleJuice,2025-05-05T11:21:54,3
