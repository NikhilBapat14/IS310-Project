"I mean yes but it's only ""intentionally"" set up that way because only really stupid people would do this.   A smart person would weigh their own personal benefit and legacy against the impact of dismantling a valuable institution.   A stupid person would just go in and start ripping out the copper pipes to sell it because they're stupid and greedy.  The values ""stupid"" and ""loyal to Trump"" are equivalent to one another. It's not a thing smart people do. Smart people are not going to work for this administration. So they're only selecting people for intelligence unintentionally, by virtue of the nature of the job itself.  They all think they're *very* smart. They think they're the smartest, because the genuinely believe they're the only ones who figured out how to do crime. They think that everyone else is too stupid to capitalize on the criminal opportunities they see.   They don't realize that many people simply aren't rabid amoral shitgibbons. We care about people around us. We care that our work is meaningful and leaves the world in a better place. That's what real intelligence is. Having the broad enough perspective to understand that mindless greed and endless corruption is a mental illness, not some golden ticket to a great life.

"Agreed. I also believe the point of putting these dumbasses in cabinet positions, and I mean all of the secretaries, is to have the American people lose confidence in having these departments operate off of taxpayer dollars.  Then they'll say, ""Oh! The American people have said they don't want their tax dollars going to these pointless departments, better consolidate and shut these things down!""  As an example, DOI is in the process of ""consolidating"" all administrative staff (i.e., IT, HR, etc.) from its agencies like USGS, NPS, etc. into the DOI headquarter level to service all agencies in DOI. This requires shrinking the workforce, hence the RIFs, in the name of ""efficiency"". Even though anyone with even half a working brain (excluding those brain worms) would know that having a small staff roster oversee administrative duties for an entire department with thousands of employees spells chaos.  Pretty soon all the departments will do the same thing, and will collectively stop functioning as a civil service and need to rely on private industry to do the heavy lifting. And I'm ever so certain that whatever company they contract with will be handpicked so that our ""leaders"" can be sure to invest money and get away with even more inside trading.  Just one big criminal heist by elected and congressionally approved folks. Nothing to see here, it's all very legal and very cool.     Edit: Oh and before I forget.

Now, let me say *IM NOT SAYING ALL WWE FANS ARE DUMB*  so don't come for me on that, I won't waste my time answering. But more educated people are less likely to enjoy the violence, more likely to see through the fake stuff to the point of not enjoying it, and most importantly to me, understand the ways the WWE screws over it's wrestlers to the point of boycotting (my brother is a huge WWE fan, and I refuse to watch for exactly that reason).

She doesn't know how any of it works, and is making stuff up to tell other people who also don't understand how it works.  It fakes and lies all the way down.  There are""remedial"" classes at every university in the world, even the best, for many reasons. Always have been.  She should know that.",pinetreesgreen,2025-05-07T13:40:32,3

"I believe they had one verifiable meeting. At this point “WCW” was the name of a wrestling program TBS aired, licensed from a regional. Vince wanted Ted to drop his contract with Georgia Championship Wrestling and sign on with the World Wrestling Federation. They had a meeting to discuss it and it went poorly. Ted declined the offer. Vince decided to go behind Ted’s back and bought out GCW from the Briscoe brothers. This left Turner no choice but to work with McMahon.  For a few weeks, that is. Turns out Vince rushed this whole deal out way too fast and didn’t have any original programming to air on World Championship Wrestling. It was basically just a repeat of his earlier shows aired in syndication that same day. Ratings took a tumble and that gave Turner the excuse he needed to cancel the contract. Vince has held a grudge ever since.",SlightlySychotic,2025-05-07T17:17:00,7
"Fair. Vince also claimed he has beaten up US Marines in his younger days, so his relationship to anything resembling truth is creative, at best.",kdlangequalsgoddess,2025-05-07T19:47:00,2

"Harvard actually has a broad range of requirements for its students. For example, all students are required to take Expository Writing and the **few** students who do not do well on an essay exam (given during the first week?) are required to take an extra semester of Intro Writing. So if someone is a genius at math or physics but is not a great writer, they may have to meet this extra requirement. Similarly, students have to fulfill core requirements (they'll get a choice of courses within a subject group like History or Literature or Social Sciences). So it's not very strange to me that they might have an Intro Math course for a few students who are not naturally gifted at Math (and won't really be doing anything academically related to math for their major)- say a world-class musician/writer who never had a talent for math?   It's crazy to me that people are piling on Harvard for this. I actually have a friend who wrote a whole social media rant about it, and I suspect that she is just bitter about not getting into an Ivy League school way back when.",friendofelephants,2025-05-07T15:45:55,3
