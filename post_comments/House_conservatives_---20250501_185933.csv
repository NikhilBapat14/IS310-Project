Soulless vampires. All of them. Let's keep hurting those who are already most vulnerable.,RockoRockyBoxxyMan,2025-05-01T19:02:28,15
">There is some consensus on certain policies, like instituting work requirements on “able bodied” adults, more frequent enrollment checks, and cutting coverage for immigrants lacking certain documentation  When a Republican advocates for a simple common sense idea, it's usually the worst interpretation possible.  * able bodied: persons who are alive. * enrollment check-up: in-person visit to Alaska. * immigrant documents: of every ancestor.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T19:10:42,14
"Many disabled people are considered ""able bodied.""  You have to be abled enough, in the right ways, to get through the bureaucracy, which usually takes years, while also being disabled enough, in the right ways, for the system to recognize.  More work would also worsen many chronic illnesses, such as fm and me/cfs. And the asset limits are below poverty levels. And the marriage bans... exist...  P.S. Should say *most* disabled people are considered ""able-bodied."" There are about 204,000,000 working age adults. During major wars, conscript forces would usually exempt about 20% of the population for obvious disabilities. So you would have well over 40,000,000 disabled working-age adults. As of 2020, 9,700,000 of them have ssdi; as of 2019, 4,646,559 of them have ssi.",Ananiujitha,2025-05-01T19:24:31,7
They have to find 880 billion in savings. At the same time they hand out 4.5 trillion in tax breaks all willy nilly to the richest people. WTF,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-01T19:37:54,5
No cuts to Medicaid you chucklefucks.,demystifier,2025-05-01T19:20:39,5
That's the Republican mission statement,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T19:06:29,6
Sounds like they will need to hire a lot of people to facilitate record keeping and in person visits.,JBWentworth_,2025-05-01T19:17:01,8
It's ideas like this that are directly responsible for the opioid crisis.,VisualFix5870,2025-05-01T19:34:54,3
"The thing about Republic common sense ideas is that: (1) they're really hard to argue against, and (2) they seek to solve a problem that is not a very big problem in the first place. In this case, I can't really come up with a reason why able bodied adults shouldn't have to work to qualify for Medicaid (and perhaps get off Medicaid if they start working). I can't argue with more frequently checking to make sure Medicaid beneficiaries are actually eligible for the program (that's an enrollment check)?  And I certainly can't argue that certain classes of immigrants should be benefitting from a program designed for US citizens. I imagine that the issues associated with these things are a much smaller problem than your average Republican congressman would tell you.  But, I don't think these are bad ideas.",Zestyclose-Rub8932,2025-05-01T19:19:00,-1
"At work we were working to help get an adult with autism approved for Social Security - they said that he was able to work since a particular year (which happened to be when he was 4 years old), and during multiple appeals, SSA would make findings like he could work if he could do these particular jobs, and we had to get them to consult with one of their vocational specialists who attested that those jobs that they listed didn't often exist anymore.   It took years.  If this was for his medicaid instead, than he wouldn't have been able to get medical treatment - other people might go through something similar, but might get sick and die without getting approved for medicaid.",Fochlucan,2025-05-01T20:50:18,4
This 100% abled body means “I don’t see nothing wrong with ya.”  You know those Karen’s that harass people with invisible disabilities that’s our government. Just a bunch of bitches and bullies.  People with invisible disabilities may become homeless and die but that’s their fault because “he who doesn’t work shall not eat.”,aneggnamedvera,2025-05-01T19:42:07,5
They have to find the money so they invented the problem. Oh they approved new bonuses for ICE agents so money can’t be a huge problem.,fairoaks2,2025-05-01T19:51:44,5

"1 - in person visits provide a huge barrier for rural areas where you might need to drive over 2 hours one way for an in person visit that may not happen.  Our local office you cannot schedule an appointment, you have to take a number and wait - I'm in Case Management and I've had staff wait for hours before they were able to get a 10 minute appointment to fix an issue for a client that we serve.  This could mean people having to take entire day off work to try to get seen, and if they do not have a car, finding someone else with a car that could take them.  2 - able body work requirements requires that burden of proof is on you to prove you can't work, and if they decide you have to work to keep your insurance, you need to be able to find a job that you have skills for - also more difficult in some areas rather than others  3 - child's insurance - most people I know cannot afford to add their children to their work place insurance - some times people choose to work less because they need to keep their household income below a certain level to keep their child's insurance, if the child has a medical need.  These are some complexities to the medicaid arguments that while they may not seem valid to other people, to the people that are in these categories, it is very valid to them.",Fochlucan,2025-05-01T20:44:40,6
To add for the work requirement. I know several people who are still in college full time and don’t work but their parents can’t afford to put them on their own insurance.,pork_chop17,2025-05-01T21:14:58,1
Yeah exactly. Money is only a problem when it helps people in poverty or nature.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-01T19:53:06,6
Then we should 100% pin it on the Republicans that made it happen and make sure every American that loses their healthcare of who to blame.,demystifier,2025-05-01T20:30:47,4
