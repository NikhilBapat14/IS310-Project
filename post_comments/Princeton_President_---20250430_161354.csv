But I thought that “DEI isn’t racist and has nothing to do with skin color”. 🤦🏻‍♂️,ITrCool,2025-04-30T16:28:07,13
Princeton’s president is a vengeful administrator who punishes anyone who questions DEI orthodoxy. They have worked behind the scenes to assemble evidence of his discriminatory policies and hope the Trump administration will restore the principle of colorblind equality on campus.,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T16:42:07,9
"Systemic racism has become a clever alternative phrase for neo-racism. Which excludes white men, Asians, Jews or any one perceived as “privileged” or a “colonialist.”   This is no longer an altruistic goal for those who are  suppressed, as much as it has become a cash cow for those wanting to make millions. Specifically off the backs of people who are fearful and think they are victims of a “perceived” racists society. Because, if you asked exactly how anyone is oppressed in the U.S., they can’t give you factual specific examples. They give feelings, emotions and talking points they have been fed by those who want to make millions off those who can’t think for themselves.",Iamstillhere44,2025-05-05T09:01:08,2
"Agree completely. But keep in mind....""equity"" is not just a ""cash cow"", it's an attempt to inundate the universities (and society at large) with a new professorial/managerial class....one that is not only racially/ethnically specific (Black, Hispanic, Muslim), but - most importantly - people imbued with a corollary ideological grounding. Imagine not just universities, but news rooms, corporate boardrooms, gov't agencies, etc.,....populated and dominated by DEI hires....all of them faithful proponents of the new religion. It's quite a novel blueprint for social revolution.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-05T09:21:45,1
