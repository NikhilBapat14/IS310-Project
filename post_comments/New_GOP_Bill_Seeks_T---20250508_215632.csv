"Systems of control that limit people’s freedom always seem to come with the justification to protect women or save children’s purity. Not to be too conspiratorial but traditionally, once this is in place they’ll be able to legislate that being LGBT in public is obscene/lewd and pornographic. It’s hard to argue for supporting something like pornography without sounding overly invested in porn, but it’s part of a much larger conversation with broad implications",Yellowpommelo,2025-05-08T22:44:39,19

"This was also in Project 2025.  EDIT: And let me remind everyone here, obscene is going to be anything they consider ""woke"" in many instances.  They will define the concept of transgender as somehow pornographic. Movies, shows, and video games will be censored. This bill doesn't look like much now, but it is the gateway to controlling tons of media. We're rapidly moving toward the north Korea stage of the US.  EDIT2: My apologies, I tried to read this article twice and didn't see when it was coming to a vote. Anyone know how soon this is going to happen?  EDIT3: I must emphasize, THIS is the wording they used. ""The bill would pave the way for the prosecution of obscene content disseminated across state lines or from foreign countries and open the door to federal restrictions or bans regarding online porn. ""  Obscene content is NOT going to be limited to porn. Look what the fucking pieces of shit have tried to claim was obscene in libraries!!!  They going to make it so that ISPs have to curate and white list only content that is 100% ""safe"" which means that, in all likelihood, even social media will be banned.  This is not only how they wall our internet from the rest of the world, it is how they will keep Americans from organizing. This is fucking huge, and no one will realize it because they keep saying it's for porn, but again, the words IN THE BILL are ""obscene material"" which has not been defined yet. They could mean fucking anything that the regime wants.",rolfraikou,2025-05-08T23:27:05,13

Let’s be real this isn’t really about children they are just using them as a dog whistle. So they can shoot down any arguments by using the whole “protect the children” as a shield.,Demonking3343,2025-05-09T01:23:06,10

"Not quite. That process is for a constitutional amendment.  We're talking about a new law here that would challenge SCOTUS rulings and count on SCOTUS to rule differently to uphold the new law from congress.  This requires only a majority vote in the house and in the senate (or 60 votes in the senate if they invoke the filibuster).  If Lee really wanted to double down, I suppose he could attempt to pass it under reconciliation (only need a simple majority), but this would be uncharted territory to pass that kind of legislation in that specific manner (not that we haven't been in uncharted territory before).  Even then, it would have to stand up to legal scrutiny. While SCOTUS is conservative, they don't rule in lockstep with the GOP so even if it passes, there's no guarantees it does or does not get struck down.  And to be honest, if ignoring juducial orders of Abrego Garcia case gives the government enough courage to give the middle finger to SCOTUS if they strike down this case, there's gonna be much bigger issues to worry about (not only in this specific case, but in so many others as well).",Vlad_Yemerashev,2025-05-09T14:39:40,1

"The Utah soda shop phenomenon is a great example of this.  Mormons can't consume caffeine or alcohol per their rules, so the only vice they have left is sugar.
