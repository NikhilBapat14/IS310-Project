"If this country is what it's been said to be, if we are the people we are supposed to be, we need to rise up and drop the hammer on these people and soon.  If there are no more meaningful elections or if there are and we just vote in some Democrats who pick up the pieces and carry on, we are doomed.

">I will vote for any Democrat who promises to prosecute every member of the Trump administration who can be prosecuted and to jail them for as long as the law allows.  A good start. But we need to go further: the GOP should be declared a rebellion, and treated accordingly. And I will definitely support and vote for any Democrat who has the gumption to state that out loud.",7figureipo,2025-05-03T23:09:03,1
"Agreed. At some point, we need to talk about the rot. And have a real expectation of personal responsibility and accountability. The greater the power, the greater the responsibility. If politicians (of all stripes) don't like it, don't cash the paycheck, because frankly, they owe us. They owe us loyalty to their oath to uphold the constitution and to every single person who funds their paycheck, that includes non-nationals here for whatever reason, paying sales taxes. They owe us a professional job, honestly done. They owe us upholding the law and prosecuting those who violate it, *especially* the powerful. And if you happen to be a supreme court justice accepting an rv from a billionaire, GTFO. And then go to jail, because that is some bullsh1t.",green-wagon,2025-05-03T06:52:42,24

"Also to add onto this, because it needs repeating. An election is not a trial. An electorate is not a jury.  There are high standards of evidence in the judicial process, there is no such standard in an election. The ""voters"" cannot render someone innocent of crimes they may have committed. This BS has been sold too often in and around but not exclusively to the right-wing electorate. That somehow because Trump won an election that makes him innocent of the crimes he would have been charged with.  This is not only untrue, but it is an immensely dangerous precedent to sell the notion that very real crimes, crimes that would land most people in prison can be tried in the ""court of public opinion"" by way of election. That would turn elections into a literal get out of jail free card and attract more criminals than it already does.  Most of the problems within and around politics stem from in some way shape or form deception and the people who sell those deceptions. You can't (in theory anyway) lie to/in a court that's one of those ""standards"" I mentioned but in politics you can lie your ass off and I'd argue the only reason the right-wing/conservative side ever gets anywhere near power outside of the reddest of states is because they have an extremely sophisticated deception apparatus which is also how one of the most corrupt and vile people to grace modern politics is seen as anything but to these people. They simply aren't shown who and what he is which is lying by omission while at the same time lying constantly about his political opponents. So no, Donald Trump is not innocent because he won an election. In fact I would argue that his rampant criminality created a do or die scenario which likely prompted him and his supporters to break the law in order to bring him back to power specifically to avoid the consequences of his lawlessness, and that isn't speculation... Elon Musk quite literally broke the law. The Trump-friendly SCOTUS basically had to say the constitution said the opposite of what the constitution said to protect him.  All of this is insanity but the most insane thing is that his supporters and cultists believe because he won elections that he is therefore innocent of any charges against him.  //end rant",ManiaGamine,2025-05-03T06:50:11,27

"You're right. Fox, Internet Trolls, Right Wing Radio, CHURCHES, Pod Casts, and more bear significant responsibilities for this. The media as a whole made money off his rhetoric and did little to stop it. IMO, they encouraged it. CBS, NBC, ABC, and so many more.

"I agree. I have a list of things that should happen.  1. No outside funding when someone runs for ANY office. They get some funds to run and that's it. That should be for State and Federal offices. 2. No lobbyist allowed. 3. No convicted criminal, felony, shall run for ANY government office. That should be for State and Federal offices. 4. No religion in any public school in any state. If they want religion in school have the kids go to a religious school like a Catholic school. 5. No religious school shall receive tax dollars to run said school. 6. No private school shall receive tax dollars. 7. Due process is required to deport anyone. 8. No child that is a US Citizen shall be deported without due process and allow the parent that is being deport to arrange for the US Citizen to stay in the US unless there is no one that is willing to take the child. 9. Disband ICE for breaking US laws and Citizens Constitutional rights. 10. Arrest cops that violate a US Citizens Constitutional rights by breaking down doors on the wrong homes and/or the wrong people inside. 11. Arrest cops for taking so called evidence from a home they know is either the wrong home or the wrong people. 12. Supreme Court age limits: No one over 70 years old. 13. Supreme Court term limits: No longer than 10 years. At age 70 they must retire. 14. Congress age limits: No one over 70 years old. 15. Congress term limits: No longer than 10 years total.
