"People need to understand that Alabama is not some conservative bastion. In fact, “I like the football team but the school is too liberal!” is a frequent complaint from people there.   It’s got a good law school and is on the right side of social issues more often than not in modern times. Nick Saban is a Democrat and donated to Hilary Clinton.  Now Auburn on the other hand is actually one of those “send your kid to a college where they don’t have black people” situations. They gave you Tommy Tubberville.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-29T18:31:50,34

"Lowder and co. sneaking around to find a replacement for Tuberville looks better and better as time goes on.  I can say that there’s great people in Auburn, but sadly it’s true that it’s the right-wing college.",teluetetime,2025-04-29T21:54:17,5
