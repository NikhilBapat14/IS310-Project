Was it a deportation or kidnapping?,creddittor216,2025-04-24T20:41:38,24
Is this a deport Maryland campaign or something?,TheeHughMan,2025-04-24T20:39:01,12

Trying to intervene after they’ve been taken is the wrong approach here. Go after the ICE folks taking them and charge them with human trafficking.,Due_Street3216,2025-04-25T05:42:04,1
A kidnapping and human trafficking,sweetbutcanbesorry,2025-04-24T21:33:24,13
Maryland is a deep blue state. Makes sense that Trump and his cronies want to punish a blue state,Defy_all_0dds,2025-04-25T08:11:41,3

Just want to make it clear you are basically advocating for a military coup. Not really sure that’s the direction we want to go with this.,Graffiti347,2025-04-24T22:42:09,3
What's the appropriate direction for when such circumstances arise?,biaggio,2025-04-25T08:24:55,2
We want it. All the sacked generals would be better,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-24T23:38:24,-2
"It probably won’t. What’s more way more likely is the military refusing an order.   If it did, you have to protest and demand that they restore democracy/hold elections immediately. Generally what happens is militaries postpone election “until stability is restored” so the goal is trying to have elections as soon as possible to prevent them from cementing power/ extending the  emergency",Graffiti347,2025-04-25T09:20:39,2
Speak for yourself. Military coup is absolute last resort type shit,UPVOTE_IF_POOPING,2025-04-25T03:20:45,3
We have a little dictator. I rather have our generals depose him. They wouldn’t rule long,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-25T08:27:01,0
You have no idea what a military dictatorship would look like. You do not want that. we have thousands of examples from around the world about how that generally doesn’t work out.,Graffiti347,2025-04-25T09:18:01,1
I don’t want a dictatorship. I want a military coup that removes republicans and gives it to democrats or at least another election,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-25T09:19:37,-1
"I get your probably just wish casting and want this guy gone ASAP, but military coups aren’t really famous for just giving up power after they do the coup. Many democracies have died this way so not something we want to hope for.",Graffiti347,2025-04-25T16:11:07,2
Trump is a dictator. Vance is a dictator. I rather have a temp military govt that isn’t right wing Christian than this,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-25T16:19:34,1
The point you don’t seem to be getting is that there is no such thing as a temporary military government. Once the take power they basically never give it up.   Also Trump may be authoritarian but he’s not as bad as most military dictators in history. He’s still got a ways to go before I would consider it an even trade,Graffiti347,2025-04-25T17:00:27,1
That’s nice. Your premise doesn’t apply here. If we had a military coup it wouldn’t be long lasting and it would restore our real democracy from republicans,MyrmidonExecSolace,2025-04-25T17:19:48,0
