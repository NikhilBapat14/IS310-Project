"In the context of school systems overall, there has been a significant increase of administrators over teachers since the 1950's with an acceleration when the Federal Department of Education was created.  This increases costs significantly as well as administrators are paid much better than actual teachers.  Yet we have seen a degradation of the school systems ability to actually teach children as well.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T11:35:22,3

Probably on par with UAW or SEIU or other unions.  The only  unions I support are Trade Unions like Electrical or Plumbers.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T12:30:49,2
"I have vague memories of an existing union that at one time was involved in ""organizing"" teachers: the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Maybe that's where their ""management"" style comes from.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-24T12:36:36,1
"All unions outside trade unions seem the same, I worked at Ford back in the 90's, my wife worked for Lear and was part of the unions.  They all seem the same to me. Power, greed, control. No caring for the actual workers in reality.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T14:22:32,2
"My Father was a Teamster organizer. I remember when he told me that in his opinion the unions were mostly out of date, useless.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-25T01:17:42,2
"My wife's grandfather was a, I think Riggers Union, organizer in the 30's and 40's.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-25T04:27:26,2
