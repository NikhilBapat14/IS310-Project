The dumb red scare.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-03T11:27:27,81
"It might be a loaded label historically, but the Soviet Union fell in 1991 and the height of the red scare was in the 1950s. Anyone under 40 has at best vague memories of the tail end of the Cold War from their young childhood, or maybe heard an older relative talk about it.  I was a little kid when the wall fell. I thought it was one of the greatest things, and not just because I loved Night Rider and Hasselhof was all over it, but my grandmother was scared of a unified Germany. She was born in the little baby boom when the doughboys came home from France after the First World War and and was a young adult during WWII. That gave her a much different view of Germany than my little mind  The red scare is the same. Younger generations aren't going to have the same view of communism without the Cold War hanging over them.
