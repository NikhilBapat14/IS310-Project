The pattern is now set. You can just not comply with government and it's OK. I hope we all enjoy our trip to anarchy.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-28T10:45:45,39
"Meanwhile, Florida Republicans will be having meetings on Benghazi, Obama’s tan suit, and whatever new conspiracy theory they can come up with about Democrats (it’s about time for them to attack video games again).  Or, maybe they just need more time so that way they can fix our insurance problems, or our toll road problems, right…right?",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-04-28T10:56:14,12
"> ""We are not judges or prosecutors. While I am firmly convinced that James Uthmeier and Jeff Aaron engaged in a conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud, and that several parties played a role in the misuse of $10 million in Medicaid funds, we as legislators will not be the ones making the ultimate charging decisions,"" said Andrade, who later told reporters he has had ""discussions"" with the U.S. Department of Justice about the transactions.  That's not what they say when they're investigating people who aren't part of their in-group.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T10:45:55,18
We have an authoritarian government like Russia where people in power will always get away with every crime they have committed.  Democracy is slowly dying in America.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-28T10:50:52,9
"An Irish woman, who is here legally and has lived here for over 30 years, now sits in a massive privately owned ICE detention center.  (Honestly not sure what's happening with her disabled child at the moment, but I'm sure those pro life pro children pro family folks have that covered!  lol).  For drug posession charges that were expunged decades ago.  She was detained when she showed up with the paperwork to demonstrate that the case they were concerned about had been expunged.  Yet this is what happens when a Republican in power is accused of stealing millions of dollars from the most vulnerable.  Why are you okay with this, Republicans?  Shouldn't there at least be an investigation?",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-28T14:20:52,5
To bad we don't live in a functional democracy anymore and the rule of law doesn't appear to apply to the current administration or anyone content to break the law to make their crime into something other then a crime..,RobbyRock75,2025-04-28T12:32:57,5

"FL state House: Oh, well the suspect is not cooperating. We have them a (no-so stern” talking to. So we are just going to drop the case. Funny, we did the same thing with that Ted Bundy guy. I wonder whatever happened to him?",Internal_Swing_2743,2025-04-28T11:36:53,2
Republicans are investigating Republicans but Republicans refuse to cooperate with the investigation so Republicans are dropping the investigation into Republicans.   Sounds reasonable. /s,Traditional-Win-3368,2025-04-29T06:16:08,1
