"Isn't the Air Wing on a Carrier a separate command that's based on the carrier but not under the carrier's Captain? Shouldn't the question be ""What's wrong with the Air Wing assigned to the Harry S Truman?""",JustinCayce,2025-05-07T16:17:03,12
"It sounds like an arresting gear failure. In other words, the big wire broke. If so, it's a miracle nobody lost a leg or other death or damage didn't occur",StratTeleBender,2025-05-07T18:21:54,8

This is actually the third jet the Truman has lost in the last six months. The first one crashed after being fired upon by the USS Gettysburg in December. (The Gettysburg  would have taken out two jets but the second was able to evade fire) Then they also managed to hit a merchant vessel just outside of the Suez Canal in February. Now they've lost two more jets in a week.   Somebody put some bad juju on that ship.,ureallygonnaskthat,2025-05-07T10:56:46,43
The reason for each accident are completely different. I don't think they're related.,specter491,2025-05-07T12:27:21,6

"Yes. CAG is a seperate warfare commander than the ship CO. That said, they're both Co equal and CAGs jets depend upon the ship and air department to be running well",StratTeleBender,2025-05-07T18:23:00,6

"And furthermore, on Reddit:  every article gets posted a shitload of times, so ""another fighter jet"" is a bad headline we're going to need to know which fighter jet ***in the sequence*** the article is speaking of.  *""May fifteen 2025, bird number seven off the whale.* **(CVN-75)***""*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T13:17:50,4
wait you mean Hegseth isn't *personally* on the boat running things with an overstocked liquor cabinet?  How will NPR report on this then???,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-07T14:10:14,16
"Not even sure how much of it you can attribute to command climate, since I remember hearing a new Captain took the reins after the merchant collision.   A carrier command I'd think would be a naval officer's stepping stone to their first star, but Truman here might indeed be cursed.   I'll happily stay on land, personally.",Dungeon_Pastor,2025-05-07T12:09:47,12

"Sir this is Reddit.¬†You know we need some made up, outraged, political explanation that makes no sense but blames Republicans.  Let me give you some examples:  - Republicans deregulated deck safety, claiming planes should ‚Äúfly free.‚Äù  - Republican admiral demanded ‚Äúfreedom launch,‚Äù ignored brakes.  - Republicans replaced wheel chocks with ‚Äúthoughts and prayers.‚Äù  - Someone has to support government spending.  And finally:  - Don‚Äôt worry, they are just being deported.  Your takes are too rational, obvious and correct. How am I ever going to get my 90k upvotes on pics?",Blarghnog,2025-05-07T12:42:36,27
"Ship CO is slightly more powerful because it's essentially owning the airport, but not really. They're really coequal O6s and both are pretty much Flag officer candidates.",StratTeleBender,2025-05-07T21:03:07,6
