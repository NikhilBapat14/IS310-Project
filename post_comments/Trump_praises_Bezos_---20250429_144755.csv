"Amazon needs to be condemned, avoided, and boycotted. We cannot continue to support these monolithic corporations that destroy local economies and kowtow to fascism. The costs are not worth the convenience.  Purchase things direct from manufacturers, find alternative sources, shop locally, etc. Whatever you can do to avoid Amazon, do it.",dietTAB,2025-04-29T15:07:36,4

Bezos junked the WP opinion page from endorsing Harris while begging for space contracts.  What do you think he was doing?  He knows there is a Amazon boycott coming soon.  You think he isn't playing this?  Of course he is.,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T14:56:44,1

Not to say avoiding Amazon as much as possible isn't a good thing.  Just that it is important to recognize things like this.  74% of Amazon's profits come from AWS. :/,Toobin4Tommy,2025-04-29T21:10:34,1
