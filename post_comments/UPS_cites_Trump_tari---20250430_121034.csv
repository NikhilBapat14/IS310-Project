"If Dems are unable to get the messaging on layoffs, tariffs, the contracture in economy to voters....I blame Dems. GOP are a lost cause. Dems need to sort out their messaging problems because one one voice gets through to voters and it seems to be the Fox News slant messaging.  edit: and yes, I blame voters for getting us into this mess - however, it is up to Dems to get their messaging problems fixed to get voters on their side. Part of politics is messaging to get voters to believe in you, and if Dems can't do that - they're a lost cause. A huge reason we are in this mess is because Dems have been unable to find an effective way to fight the right wing messaging conglomerate. Biden went 4 years with ineffective messaging and a mindset of, ""the people will see the results."" Nope. They need 2020's social media bombardment and brainwashing. Kamala saw that and was able to bring a blowout loss to a near 50/50 result, but she needed more time after the Biden administration of 4 years of playing by old rules.",d0mini0nicco,2025-04-30T12:42:54,-6
I am no fan of Trump (understatement) but big companies always blame the most recent big thing by the government as the reason for layoffs as a cover for wanting to pad quarterly/annual profit margins.,L11mbm,2025-04-30T13:04:51,-6

"No, I blame Dems if they are unable to pull their head out of their corporate donor asses, sort their messaging problems out, and actually figure out a way to reach voters with the most obvious and effective messaging: their wallets negatively affected by Trump/GOP, ect.   Like the reply below, voters have been bombarded by propaganda that anything wrong is Dems fault when their are two major political parties, and one is historically the cause for the economic problems over the past several decades. The fact that people today STILL believe GOP is better for the economy is a sign Dems STILL can not message effectively and only one message is reaching voters.",d0mini0nicco,2025-04-30T13:00:17,-8
