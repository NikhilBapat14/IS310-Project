"I don't think Trump is bright enough to have deeper thoughts and plans, but there is a Yarvin-style effort driving this regime.  It's all connected...  \- Eliminate sources of cheap labor within the US by targeting immigrants, legal or undocumented.  \- Move manufacturing back to the US through tariff pressures.    \- Reduce liberal sectors for work - non-profits, government, higher education, jobs requiring degrees, etc.  \- Americans move into manufacturing jobs.  Same with farming, labor and trades.  \- Promote Christianity, eliminate gender and sexual deviance, as well as trade unions, to promote social order.  \- Women are removed from the workplace so society can grow with the ""right"" people breeding.    \- Eliminate government support, thus creating a society where work is your only path.  \- The ownership class further concentrates wealth and power with an abundant supply of workers.  It's literally the immediate post-WWII America, which works great if you're white, male, cis, straight, etc.  Margaret Atwood nailed it in The Handmaid's Tale...  *Better never means better for everyone.  It always means worse, for some.*",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T07:39:27,20

"IF ? WTF do you mean “IF” he is pushing legal immigrants out Incase you haven’t been paying attention some he sent to a prison in El Salvador , some teachers, students, scientists he pulled their visas there are so many more examples including construction workers legally working paying taxes were rounded up and deported. In a town near me the SS rounded up roofers legally here legally working paying taxes and deported try getting your roof done now there’s no one to do it. Farms haven’t planted because of the shortage of workers. It’s hitting now and will get worse wait till the shelves are empty. But the republicans want to use child labor check the law proposed in FL and other states by GQP Nazis",CAM6913,2025-05-08T08:48:08,3
"President Trump's efforts to strip legal protections and work permits from hundreds of thousands of immigrants already in the US, combined with his border crackdown, threaten the migrant workforce that has driven US job creation since 2020.  The loss of these workers could have a significant impact on industries such as construction, agriculture, meatpacking, and food processing, which have relied on immigrant labor to fill essential positions and sustain operations.

"I honestly think that the philosophy driving the Trump regime is the belief that global society is on the brink of collapse - immigration is destroying societal order, climate change is about to hit, climate refugees are going to become a thing and nations will be left to fend for themselves.  It's based on the belief that global trade will collapse in the near future.  The Christian Nationalist far right believes that the US will be uniquely positioned to survive and even better if we have the resources of Canada and Greenland.  They're banking on the collapse and are prepping, literally.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T08:14:52,6
