"""A statement released by both officials' offices said in part, ""Republican leaders have made clear their intention to use the coming weeks to advance a reckless budget scheme to President Trump's desk that seeks to gut Medicaid, food assistance and basic needs programs that help people, all to give tax breaks to billionaires. Given what's at stake, these could be some of the most consequential weeks for seniors, kids and families in generations.""",Lebarican22,2025-04-27T08:56:38,74

"Yes! Booker understands that there is a war for attention that the Democrats have been losing. I love Booker going to old school tactics, his marathon talking filibuster and now a sit in on the Capitol steps.",MrYdobon,2025-04-27T10:26:13,30

That is what I am hoping. The Republicans sit it out and Democrats/Independents/Traditional Republicans show up in record numbers. ,Lebarican22,2025-04-27T15:41:19,3
"The appointees would get in regardless of how democrats voted.  And from what I've read most of the time it was voting for people like Rubio who atleast has experience and seems like most some voted for others with actual qualifying experience but were against those that were clearly unqualified like Hegseth and others.   So I could in a way see why some dems would say hey let's vote for Rubio as he will hopefully do a better job than if he isn't approved maybe Trump appoints another person from Fox that isn't qualified.  Maybe picking and choosing their battles there.   No democrat voted yes for all.  Only 5 democrats voted yes for 10 out of the 20 or I think 21 appointees.  The vast majority voted no for the clear MAGA ones   EDIT :  I was right...all voted for Rubio... otherwise imo it makes sense to vote yes for the qualified ones vs Trump putting in someone with no experience and just a complete Trump MAGA maniac   So it's not like they were voting in Hegseth and other just clearly MAGA people and instead voted for those that they hope have some decency left.  As much as I hate Republicans I feel like it kinda makes sense in a way as regardless even if all voted no it wouldn't change anything so vote yes for a few that they have worked with as the other option could be more extreme MAGA vs the more conservative ones like Rubio   [source for where I got that info ](https://ballotpedia.org/How_senators_voted_on_Trump_Cabinet_nominees,_2025)",kpofasho1987,2025-04-27T15:34:04,3
