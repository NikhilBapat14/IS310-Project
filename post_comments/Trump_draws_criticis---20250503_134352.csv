"The minimum criteria for Pope is ""Baptized Catholic male"". Meaning Biden is theoretically eligible.    Obama is not eligible. Trump who has divorce and remarried 3 times,  is certainly not eligible.    So... quick make one of Biden.",hendrixski,2025-05-03T15:11:14,4

I don’t think Trump meets the minimums as his was raised Presbyterian and I believe identifies himself as non denominational.   It would probably annoy Trump to no end if he learned that Biden is more eligible than him.,Norn-Iron,2025-05-03T16:22:06,2

He's certainly got enough sex crimes in his past to qualify as catholic leader...or any religious leader,ggaassghd677,2025-05-03T18:34:20,1
That’s why he could never be Pope. There is nowhere else to reassign him to avoid what he’s done. The Catholic Church does love shuffling around troublesome clergy.,Norn-Iron,2025-05-03T18:36:44,0
"Meh... these comments aren't edgy anymore.  Benedict XVI put in place changes to stop that shuffling from happening, and he defrocked hundreds of priests who were accused. Francis had a legit iron fist when it came to dealing with abuse accusations. Shuffling pedophiles hasn't been happening  in the Vatican for almost 20 years now so how are people pretending as if it's some kind of ongoing activity? It was bad. It's bad in the past tense.",hendrixski,2025-05-03T19:40:57,1

Do people not know how to use Google? Benedict XVI is the one who put in place the canon laws that ended the practice of shuffling around priests. He defrocked hundreds of accused priests (including ones inside the Vatican inner circle) and met with abuse survivors. How does he get blamed for this crap?,hendrixski,2025-05-03T19:37:44,2
