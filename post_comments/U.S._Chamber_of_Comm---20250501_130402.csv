"I want his voters to feel the pain. ¬†It‚Äôs the only way they might learn.  Unlike 2007 aftermath when republicans were able to spin blame for housing crisis to Clinton era policies, this is all on Trump. ¬†Republicans own this shit show. ¬†",Gator1508,2025-05-01T13:15:15,28
"It‚Äôs too late, and Trump doesn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs already in the ‚Äúlet them eat cake‚Äù phase of democracy‚Äôs death.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-01T13:06:03,19
"Tariff adjustments, delays, cancellations, etc are what he faces everyday to curb off a recession. Yet, he still can‚Äôt be convinced that is the actual problem, it‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs Biden and not the exact thing causing so much chaos. We‚Äôre watching a snake eat its tail bite by bite.",SickARose,2025-05-01T13:09:57,6
I thought tariffs were good.,homebrew_1,2025-05-01T13:53:02,3
"Better buy TrumpBux if they're serious about ""stav[ing] off a recession.""",C_MMENTARIAT,2025-05-01T13:15:59,3
What a bunch of clowns.  Most right-leaning people know Tariffs are a bad deal but are cowards to speak up and yell it out loud.,Art_Dude,2025-05-01T13:23:06,3
The chamber needs to understand the approach to handle Trump is confrontation over policy instead of groveling-cum-exemption-seeking.,steve_ample,2025-05-01T13:30:13,2
"For Trump, it‚Äôs just a matter of control and people begging him for relief. He could give two F‚Äôs about the country or ANY of its citizens. This is what the country voted for!üíÄ",Imyoteacher,2025-05-01T13:41:45,2
There is a larger problem here that people aren‚Äôt addressing.  They are pleading with the leader for favors. The reason why patronage societies don‚Äôt work is because approval of the Leader is a terrible way to run an economy.¬†,eskimospy212,2025-05-01T17:07:25,1
Meanwhile the US Chamber of Commerce donated almost exclusively to republican candidates. They are in the FO stage of FAFO,winelover08816,2025-05-01T17:42:28,1
I work with a MAGA and he still believe this is all Biden's doing. His only source of info is Patriot radio on the way to work,Altruistic-Letter772,2025-05-01T17:34:12,0
"They CONTINUE to blame the economy on Biden, and his cult eats it up. The people voting Republican will not change their mind at this point. The majority of the population that chose not to vote, on the other hand, will be the biggest group changing their tune.",Jimmy_G_Wentworth,2025-05-01T13:32:18,12
Well dems played dead and let that happen then and they have even less fight and support now. Watch that same shit happen again.  Any day now the Russia influence machine turns on and talking points blaming this on Biden start.,justbrowse2018,2025-05-01T16:36:10,1
"Well... this is one of, if not the largest donor to the Republican Party. This matters way more than Musk to the people in Congress.",rage_panda_84,2025-05-01T13:14:17,10
"Yeah they better not be a ""PANICAN"", as Trump said that would mean they are weak and stupid people. As he also said ""ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL"".   Of course Trump may do exactly the opposite of what he told others not to do and back down. Nobody knows. What we do know is he wants to make others suffer so they have to beg.",Manicplea,2025-05-01T14:22:05,2
The independents is the group to win. ¬†When I saw the election night swing in Georgia I knew it was over. ¬† They can easily swing back. ¬†,Gator1508,2025-05-01T13:34:14,7
Came here to say this.  This is the business wing of the party standing up and clearing their throats.,DontCovfefeMyHeart,2025-05-01T13:20:03,4
"Independents blame anything bad on the current government, because they're too short sided to think critically. That might work out in our favor here for once.",hookyboysb,2025-05-01T16:56:53,8
"This should've happened weeks ago, but yeah, seems like the business wing putting pressure on Johnson and Republican leadership to at least use the leverage you have to win some concessions from the White House and grab some control of the situation.  What the Chamber is asking for would essentially end the effectiveness of these tariffs while giving Trump an out. Another sign that rank-and-file Republicans have lost faith in Trump over these tariffs.",rage_panda_84,2025-05-01T13:23:22,4
