Crazy that Pritzker is one of the leading Dems in opposing Trump. He has both the reach and the influence to actually create a sea change in the party if he can get more national attention.,DisMFer,2025-05-07T08:03:02,2295

"My Gov making me proud; Alternate link without paywall:  [https://www.nprillinois.org/health-harvest/2025-05-07/in-response-to-rfk-jr-pritzker-to-sign-first-in-nation-executive-order-protecting-autism-data](https://www.nprillinois.org/health-harvest/2025-05-07/in-response-to-rfk-jr-pritzker-to-sign-first-in-nation-executive-order-protecting-autism-data)  ""Gov. JB Pritzker on Wednesday plans to sign an executive order to restrict the mass collection and sharing of autism-related data for Illinois residents, in response to the country’s top health secretary’s rhetoric around the cause of autism.  ""The executive order comes after Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, recently said he would undertake a “massive testing and research effort” to determine the cause of autism, including an investigation into whether any environmental factors are causing the development disorder.""  The governor’s office said the executive order is in response to rising concerns about efforts to create federal autism registries or databases without legal safeguards or accountability. With Pritzker’s signature, Illinois will become the first state to formally restrict the collection or sharing of autism-related data absent legal or medical necessity.  “Every Illinoisan deserves dignity, privacy, and the freedom to live without fear of surveillance or discrimination,” Pritzker said in a statement. “As Donald Trump and DOGE threaten these freedoms, we are taking steps to ensure that our state remains a leader in protecting the rights of individuals with autism and all people with disabilities.”  ""Kennedy angered many with autism, and their loved ones, when he called it a “preventable disease” and an epidemic. The National Institute of Mental Health calls it a “neurological and developmental disorder that affects how many people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.”",ChiGuy6124,2025-05-07T08:01:37,273

"My girlfriend and I recently had a minor argument over this. At the beginning of the year I went to the doctor’s and mentioned wanting to be tested to see if I fall on the spectrum. I’m very functional and it wasn’t until the last few years that we realized I may be on the spectrum given things like hyper fixations on certain activities/hobbies, having the same routine for stuff and not wanting to change it, and sometimes having trouble understanding what others are feeling. Anyway she is a huge mental health proponent and was so proud of me bringing it up to my doctor and that I was going to be tested.   But once this insane list news broke I told her that I would rather wait out this presidency because I think it is insane for me to voluntarily put myself on a list for the Trump admin to do god knows what with, especially when my case would be incredibly mild if anything so the risk outweighs any benefit I’d get with a proper diagnosis. She got really upset but also understood where I was coming from.   I hope my governor has the balls to do something about this. I wrote him an email a month ago asking if he has plans to do anything about legal residents of our state getting deported, and he still hasn’t responded. Not even a canned PR response. The silence is deafening.  I have been saying that Democrats are starting to look like controlled opposition but I never imagined my governor would be a part of that too. It’s a stark contrast to our senator Chris Murphy, who has been very vocal about this admin. Our governor seems just fine with all that is going on.",pkosuda,2025-05-07T09:02:25,15

It shouldn’t be. Is it really controversial that the long term affects of vaccines needs to be studied and publicly reported? That shouldn’t be. It also shouldn’t be controversial that potential causes for birth defects and autism is studied, because as it is today, the autism numbers are growing each year and I think that we deserve to know if its caused by external factors.

"There's absolutely nothing controversial about studying potential causes for birth defects or autism; the problem is that what RFK Jr wants to do isn't science.   Vaccines don't cause autism, full stop. The paper which put forth that theory was intentionally fraudulent (its author wanted to peddle his own vaccine, hence the motivation to show the MMR was ""harmful"") and multiple studies since then have demonstrated no connection between vaccines and autism. There's been a publicly available database of adverse vaccine effects for years, and NIH-sponsored studies can be found as technical reports at the research institutions or on pubmed, so a lot what you hypothetically want already exists.  The problem with RFK Jr is that his beliefs are not evidence-based. He latches on to unproven or disproven theories and won't let go of them, and that's not how science works. Sure, you might come up with some out-there hypothesis, but when the data shows you're wrong, you have to give it up.  Autism data is being obscured to protect it from abuse or deletion/corruption, not to hide the truth. Given that the Trump administration has already been deleting history it considers too DEI, I don't think that's alarming.

"I think it depends on the area a bit. I grew up in rural Southwest Minnesota, went to the cities for college, lived in the metro and suburbs for 10 years after, and moved North past the suburbs for the last 5, so I've kinda experienced a few different areas in my life.   Southwest Minnesota is full of people who will talk grain and livestock prices, sports, community things, and maybe throw in some bs they heard on Fox News, but they'll generally keep to themselves and leave you alone. An exception of this is when they talk shit about you because it's a small town and there's nothing better to do.  You obviously know the metro so no elaboration needed.  A bit up North, there's some more perceivable support for more outward right wing nonsense, but there's also a solid group that is very progressive. I wouldn't call it 50/50, but it's damn close. I feel pretty comfortable where I'm at.  The area that seems to be the Florida of the North is the St. Cloud area. Most of the extreme right wing shit I've seen and heard about has been from that area, and that area makes me a bit uncomfortable.  Edit: I was just speaking in terms of safety/comfort. The red/blue in the rural counties I've lived in has often been pretty close or 60/40, but there are some areas that feel like it's 90/10.",_BlakeDeadly_,2025-05-07T11:51:26,14

"And in the end, Trump is a pitchman fronting for a bunch of billionaires.  They will not care when he gets forgotten.  He may not be thrown directly under the bus by them, just put out to pasture and his voice diminished in media volume, but the propaganda machine will keep rolling.  They'll say MAGA is bigger than Trump.  They'll say it's time for young blood.  When we point to the atrocities, the horrible things, the illegal and corrupt acts, they'll say ""that was under Trump, it's different!""  They will never once admit that MAGA, and conservative greed, are the root problem.  That the hatred they've harbored to get votes for power is now a danger to us all.  And if that means that in 15 years time, if you ask a conservative about why it was okay under Trump to do all these things they have claimed to be against (not that they're against most of them, but he's ballooning the budget and demanding to be allowed to add trillions to the budget ceiling without having to fight each time for it), they'll refuse to connect who they are with who they were (and still are).  They are dishonest people who are greedy and selfish, and we need to have a fundamental fight for an end to the greed, a reigning in of the rich.  I'm not a communist, because I don't believe in going to extremes on ideology like that; It opens loopholes when you are so firm on an ideology that you refuse to allow common sense to step in.  Yes, we can have wealthy people - every society has them.  But we need to reign in how much they can make, how much they can control, how much profit is reasonable.  The only reason Elon Musk is so much more wealthy, even when adjusted for inflation and other factors, is that we stopped taxing them so much.  Reagan broke taxes on the rich, and the rich never once trickled that shit down.  Because it's a fucking myth that they would.  When profit margins are higher than ever, our extreme system of capitalism seems to say ""ask for more, it is your duty, always more, number always go up, no matter what.""  The wealthy got this wealthy, and have pushed so much more of a wealth gap, because they cut employee benefits, they forced them to work harder than ever, they made the products worse, they charged more money, and they ensured their compensation at the top was more than ever.  That needs to go.  We need government oversight, with rotating auditors and randomized assignments of them to ensure limits on profits and a balance of profit vs employee and customer concerns.  It is time to stop enshittifingy everything in the name of almighty profit.  We can have reasonable profits, and industries where we protect businesses that follow the rules and seek more humble profit margins that do not always need to go up.  Laws that put a chunk of those profits back into the entire employee pool, not just the top.  Laws that prevent someone like Wal-Mart running at a loss for a few years in an area to drive the competition out, so they can have their monopoly and start dictating prices and controlling suppliers.  We need a balance, not extreme oligarchy and authoritarianism.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-07T20:49:23,3

"“Vaccine is injected into your blood stream whereas fish is filtered through your bodies by natural process”  You do know our blood gets filtered as well every single second, also fish gets into our blood as well  Think of it as the two alcohols, methanol and ethanol  Ethanol, which is what people love to drink for fun gets into you your blood and your body processes/metabolize it fast  While Methanol, which is crap ton more deadly and dangerous than ethanol, does still get process/metabolize your body but at a slower rate with byproducts being produced at the same time   So even if we get injected its still going to be process naturally through our body, cause our liver and kidneys will literally take it out Since there is the same situation for mercury, which is Methylmercury and Ethylmercury  Methylmercury is the what we worry the most as its literally in fish like tuna we eat, and its quite easy to get and accumulate more quickly than Ethyl mercury due to MethylMercury being processed more slowly   Infact, you could be literally eating more methylmercury if you are eating fish, than what you are being injected with.",Slibye,2025-05-08T09:33:46,1

"And lost the electoral college and the election. If popular vote mattered sure, but the popular vote only matters in like 5 or 6 states and they went for Trump in 2016. Believe me I wish it weren’t this way. 2024 was eye opening as an American. To watch a heavily qualified women lose to a xenophobic, deranged egomaniac who speaks in nothing but word salad, had numerous felony charges/convictions, sent a violent mob to kill his own VP when he DID lose an election, and has been found liable for rape and sexual assault lose an election to said man. Yeah, that was eye opening to know how truly awful a large portion of this country is. I think Pritzker is our best chance in 2024. I hate to do the whole thing”electability” thing that we did during the 2020 primaries, but we at this point don’t have time to mess around. We need a Democratic President in the White House in 2029 to fix this huge mess, and it’s definitely going to be a big one to clean up, considering we’re only 5 months into this term and it’s already a complete mess.",PsychologicalCase10,2025-05-07T13:53:27,9
