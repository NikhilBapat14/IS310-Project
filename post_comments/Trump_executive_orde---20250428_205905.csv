"This is actually a good thing lol and it’s already a DOT requirement. I don’t think u guys understand how much freight gets delayed to deliver due to non speaking English drivers that end up causing issues for everyone. That’s not to say that shippers and receivers and even brokers don’t cause issues sometimes but having a driver that’s fluent in English knocks down one of those problems. It’s also a lot of these foreign drivers that are taking low rates on freight and fucking up the market for all the other truck drivers, and then u wonder why so many truck drivers quit the business, they can’t afford the damn insurance,fuel, and truck or trailer payments put in place when they’re bidding against a non English speaker for loads  who is taking dirt cheap rates",akmmane4eva,2025-04-30T12:42:40,2

"Yes, absolutely. That’s why it’s bullshit. every country I’ve ever been to including my home here in America requires you to be able to understand road signs. I’ve never been anywhere that will let you drive around if you cant read the signs.  It’s one of the key parts of getting your commercial drivers license.  And of course, like you said, understanding the local language and understanding the nuances of specific road names is always going to be a learning process. But you must know the difference between it’s safe to park here versus dont drive off a cliff.  Which is exactly why this is nonsense. No truck driver would be authorized or hired. If they couldn’t get around safely, this thing about the English language is bullshit. Like I said my comment if you’re hauling dangerous goods or something hazardous. You really need to be able to discuss that properly for an emergency situation. You know, so you can tell the firefighters to run away or not put water on it, etc.…   As long as a driver can find their way from the road to the loading dock and ask someone where they want the truck parked it’s fine.   In the USA at least, the law requiring truck drivers to have English proficiency established in 1937. It’s just never been enforced. And so now you’re gonna end up with ice agents, giving language tests to truck drivers…  Again, and this is my personal belief, I believe this is just setting up a story so that when we no longer have goods coming into the country, this is what they will say where all the truck drivers have gone.  But it’s hard to understand what’s going on with our government right now. Lots of rules are being made that dont make sense.
