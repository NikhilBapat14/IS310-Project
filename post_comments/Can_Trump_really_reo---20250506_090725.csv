No - this is just more cruel entertainment for the MAGA crowd.,jrsinhbca,2025-05-06T09:10:30,22
"It would cost millions, if not a billion, to rebuild the site. Everything, and I do mean everything, would have to be taking down and rebuilt. They have no water source so something has to be about that. Sewage, electricity, water, buildings that are falling apart...cost is the point.    This is nothing more than a distraction for tRump. Don't look at the man behind the curtain...look over here instead.",Harry_Mud,2025-05-06T09:19:30,10
My guess is they'll spend a lot of money before deciding that it's not feasible.,DepartmentOfJustAss,2025-05-06T09:19:11,5
Not in 3 1/2 years. It will take years and close to a billion dollars. The planning phase alone will take several years.,Traditional-Win-3368,2025-05-06T09:21:12,5
It belongs to the national park service so hopefully not.  We don't want to set the precedent.  Rebuilding and getting everything up to code would most likely cost billions.  Then the loss of tourist dollars and continued maintenance due to the harsh conditions on top of that.  Why would it deter crime more than any other prison?  Some criminals may think it's cool to be locked up on the now infamous rock vs a standard prison.,LeoRavus,2025-05-06T09:42:15,5
Remember when the MAGAs all pretended to care about prison conditions and reform after January 6?,AnteaterPositive6939,2025-05-06T09:24:18,3
Yes he can. It will take at least 5 years if not 10 and spend all of the money and possibly more that Elon claims he saved.,Winterwasp_67,2025-05-06T09:28:56,4
Yes... Based on a movie. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,williamgman,2025-05-06T09:26:43,3
It would not open in his term so not likely to happen. It wouldn‚Äôt be cheap. It is cheaper to build private prisons and I am sure he will watch Shawshank Redemption and be fine with that. What is wrong with one white banker escaping in his eyes?,Morepastor,2025-05-06T09:41:14,3
no... and please don't show him the movie Escape Plan,JaVelin-X-,2025-05-06T09:45:13,3
This will happen right after the wall is completed and the check from Mexico clears.,Caraes_Naur,2025-05-06T10:02:44,3
He has a hard time opening a bag of cheeto's without help....,stayathmdad,2025-05-06T09:22:25,2
"Wouldn‚Äôt the city of SF have to agree to this? It‚Äôs classified as a museum now, right? I feel like there‚Äôs no way it can happen. Just seems like more bullshit.",CJDistasio,2025-05-06T09:30:05,2

Can he? Yes Will he? Depends on how much money they are paying him.,laserdisk4life,2025-05-06T09:38:03,1
Show Orange Fortress (1992 film) Then he will want to expand NASAs budget.,ImaginationToForm2,2025-05-06T16:02:44,1
why even waste time thinking about this?   this will not happen.  trump has probably already forgotten about saying this.,velvet_funtime,2025-05-06T17:01:22,1
Pretty much,vixox00,2025-05-06T09:13:02,10
1.5bn was the estimate I saw. And that seems conservative to me in a world where a football stadium can cost almost as much ..,Musicman1972,2025-05-06T09:47:18,10
It would take 4 years just to draw up the plans.,jimmygee2,2025-05-06T09:32:53,8
