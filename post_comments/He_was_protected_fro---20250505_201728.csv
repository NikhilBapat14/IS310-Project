"I thought this was another Kilmar Abrego Garcia article, but no...  >Crucially, Lozano-Camargo was also covered by a 2024 legal settlement that barred immigration authorities from deporting him while his request for asylum was pending. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, the Trump-appointed judge who approved that settlement, ruled last month that Lozano-Camargo’s deportation violated the agreement.  Interesting that a trump-appointed judge is responsible for this settlement! Good for her for ruling that this deportation was a violation of it.  >Gallagher ordered the administration to “facilitate” Lozano-Camargo’s return, but the Trump administration is resisting that demand. In a court filing released Monday, the Justice Department called Lozano-Camargo a member of “a violent terrorist gang” and said that disqualifies him from asylum in the U.S.  Apparently the word ""facilitate"" means ""do absolutely nothing at all whatsoever."" That's a lesson I've learned from the trump administration.",sachiprecious,2025-05-05T20:30:24,17

"Daniel Lozano-Camargo was erroneously deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration in violation of a legal settlement.  > “My son isn’t one of Tren de Aragua,” his mother, Daniela Camargo, declared in a tearful Facebook video. “Anyone who knows my son knows he’s innocent.” Lozano-Camargo’s lawyers did not answer questions about their client. His mother and girlfriend did not immediately respond to inquiries.  > Crucially, Lozano-Camargo was also covered by a 2024 [legal settlement](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.457483/gov.uscourts.mdd.457483.199.2.pdf) that barred immigration authorities from deporting him while his request for asylum was pending.
