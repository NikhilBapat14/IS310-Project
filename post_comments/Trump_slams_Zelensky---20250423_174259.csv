"This is a continuation of Trump and Vance lashing out at Zelensky at the White House.  ""I AM A MASTER DEALMAKER.  NOW WHY DON'T YOU JUST SURRENDER?!?!""  John Bolton:  >Trump has said many times publicly that he believes if he has good relations with a foreign head of state, then the U.S. has good relations with that country. And the opposite is also true. If he has bad relations with a foreign head of state, U.S. relations with that country are bad. **Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin.** He has said in just the past few weeks, “Putin says he wants peace, and I trust him. I think if he didn't want peace, he would tell me.” So that gives you a pretty good idea of how he sees Putin.  >Now, I don't think Putin thinks he's Trump's friend at all. I think Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that's what he's been doing since the inauguration, if not before.  >[https://kyivindependent.com/putin-thinks-trump-is-an-easy-mark-john-bolton-says-in-interview/](https://kyivindependent.com/putin-thinks-trump-is-an-easy-mark-john-bolton-says-in-interview/)  (Times are so strange that Bolton has become the voice of reason.)",I405CA,2025-04-23T17:54:58,11

"> “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Mr. Trump wrote. “The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the ‘killing field,’ and nobody wants that!”  This idiot doesn't understand one thing about the history of this war, does he?  First of all, both the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine are seen as clear violations of the past agreements.  That being said, a little over a decade ago, Putin offered refuge to his pro-russian puppet and former president of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych after he fled to Russia following mass protests against his government. Yanukovych backed out of a planned signing of an association agreement with the EU, and largely at the behest of Putin.   This paved the way for new elections in Ukraine, and Putin took this personally.  Around the same time, armed men began to seize control of infrastructure in Crimea.  Shortly after this, Putin ordered a snap referendum on the prospect of Crimea joining Russia. He then used the results to justify Russia's ""reincorporation,"" and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The results of the referendum have been called into question as it was held under the presence of Russian military forces.  This piece of history makes Trump's attacks on Zelensky seem all the more unsettling.  Then there's his brilliant negotiating strategy:  > ""He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.""  It's not ""peace"" if you concede to every one of Putin's demands and give him time to recoup and reorganize his forces for another ""special military operation.""  And don't tell me this isn't the case. Since when have you known Putin to uphold his end of the bargain, and how naive do you have to be to think that Putin will simply abandon his imperialist ambitions and his land grabbing campaign?  Putin has violated damn near every agreement since he first came into power, and he has made it perfectly clear that—under his stead—Russia is historically destined to reclaim its territory and become a dominant world superpower. Not to mention Putin's commitment to expanding his oil empire.  Keep in mind that Trump promised peace on ""day one"" and throughout Biden's term he repeatedly touted that if he were president, this war would have never happened in the first place.  Nevermind that Trump likely helped accelerate this war to begin with, or the fact that his efforts thus far have been nothing short of derelict, but also bear in mind that Trump failed to negotiate a peace during his first term while Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout the entirety of his presidency.  Also don't forget that Trump's ""peace"" efforts so far have involved him extorting Zelensky and disparaging him in public while not offering one word of rebuke for Putin.  Trump even had the audacity to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" not only ignoring the fact that Zelensky was elected in a landslide back in 2019 and his constitution forbids elections during wartime, but also that Putin, an *actual* dictator, has been in power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.  That being said, the Trump Administration's current ""peace plan"" aligns closely with Russia's long standing goals and Trump officials have been threatening to ""walk away"" from the so-called peace process if Ukraine doesn't ostensibly agree to the following:  - That Russian forces be allowed to remain deep inside of Eastern Ukraine  - That Ukraine withdraw its troops from territory that Russia currently occupies  - That Ukraine relinquish nearly one fifth of this territory to Russia  - That Ukraine accept Russia's annexation of Crimea as legal and legitimate  - and that Ukraine agree to never become part of NATO.  Now tell me, in what fucking world does this deal benefit Ukraine in the slightest?  And don't give me some BS about it ""ending the war,"" because for one, the war is *never* over for Putin, and two, the Trump administration doesn't care about ending the war, they just want some fleeting credit for hastening a process that will only help Putin realize some of his immediate goals.  Trump also made a detestable statement during a recent oval office appearance with Marco Rubio, calling Ukrainians ""fools"" if they don't accept the deal.   > “we’re just going to say, ‘You’re foolish, you’re fools, you’re horrible people, and we’re going to just take a pass.’”  Great ""negotiating"" skills from the president here. This is obviously directed at Ukraine. Trump has made blunder after blunder throughout the entire peace process, and now he's insulting and blaming Ukraine for his own failures.  JD Vance is also trying desperately to spin this:  > We’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”  > “The current lines, or somewhere close to them, is where you’re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,” he added. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”  Vance conveniently didn't mention what Russia would have to ""give up,"" because this so-called ""freeze"" would be forcing Ukraine to surrender a disproportionate amount of land to Russia, violating past agreements and Ukraine's right to self-determination.  And it's obvious that this deal is egregiously one sided because Kremlin officials have been welcoming these remarks, while Ukrainian leaders have had no other recourse but to push back.  > “There is nothing to talk about. This violates our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky told reporters in a news conference.  Another top Ukrainian official even weighed in:  > Yulia Svyrydenko, the Ukrainian economy minister, also vowed that her country “will never recognize the occupation of Crimea.” Writing on X, the social media site, she said that “Ukraine is ready to negotiate — but not to surrender. There will be no agreement that hands Russia the stronger foundations it needs to regroup and return with greater violence.”  She's right... She's absolutely right.  Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he knew the risks involved. He knew that Hitler was a dangerous expansionist looking to seize control of territory by any means necessary, and that any overtures of peace were merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recover his forces, only to later resume his warmongering offensive.  It's the same situation with Putin, but unfortunately our leaders don't have the foresight, nor the knowledge, not even the goodwill to care about the fate of Ukraine.  Trump even had the gall to attack Zelensky again:  > In his statement, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Zelensky of making “inflammatory” statements that he claimed would prolong the war.  Are you kidding me? Your entire approach to ""ending the conflict"" has been to escalate and inflame tensions, making allies of enemies and enemies of allies along the way.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-23T17:57:06,10
