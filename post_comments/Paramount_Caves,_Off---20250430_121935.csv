"It also turned over the transcript and camera footage from the interview to the FCC as part of the agency‚Äôs investigation into allegations of ‚Äúnews distortion,‚Äù which are now publicly available.  But that hasn‚Äôt stopped Trump from calling for CBS to face the ‚Äúmaximum fines and punishment‚Äù over the interview, including potentially losing its broadcast license.  I would have no problem if CBS lost its license, not a big deal. If you have no problem committing fraud, your license should be revoked!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T12:28:16,231
The mainstream media has to be held accountable by the law for the lies and division it brings into the society.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-30T14:02:58,95
"I think what CBS did was BS, but it's also crazy that they have to fight this lawsuit filed by the sitting President of the US, who is also the head of the executive branch that controls the FCC which ultimately controls their broadcasting license.    This is such an uneven fight it's crazy.  As much as I think the legacy media misbehaved, I don't think this is the way to fix it.  This is just a case of an all powerful government dropping a sledge hammer on a liberal leaning business.    If this is a new precedent, conservative businesses better watch out then the Dems are back in charge.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-30T12:46:52,192

All I‚Äôve heard from liberals for the past 9 years is nonstop bitching about media manipulation and election tampering via misinformation. Usually with a Russian rider attached. Given how vehemently they‚Äôve been opposed to media manipulation for election influence SURELY they would want cbs to lose their license over such a blatant attempt at influencing an election.

">I would have no problem if CBS lost its license, not a big deal. If you have no problem committing fraud, your license should be revoked!  Agree üíØ % - folks who traffic in lies should never have a broadcasting license.  Innocent mistake is not fraud.  What CBS did is fraud in my opinion.",GiediOne,2025-04-30T12:29:45,106
"Just remember, this is how Fox got sued for $787 billion or whatever it was and Tucker Carlson got fired.

"He was not a sitting president when it was filed iirc. And I'm pretty sure it was the campaign that filed it. Yeah, bad optics maybe, but the degrees of separation are there.",deciduousredcoat,2025-04-30T14:06:04,101

This one is great and they absolutely deserve it. They spliced an interview with a presidential candidate to have them say answers they didnt give. As far as im concerned its fraud.,ultrainstict,2025-04-30T14:42:32,78
Its not insane to go after violations of the law. Its not even chilling either as news networks are practically dead. No one watches them.,PFirefly,2025-04-30T15:05:51,32
If you‚Äôre pedaling conspiracy theories as news and misleading folks intentionally I have no problem with the hammer coming down on you. News outlets should be held to higher standards for supposedly credentialed professionals.,kgthdc2468,2025-04-30T18:16:56,24
"I don't think what is happening with this CBS matter is a ""legal attack by the government against the media"". President Trump sued CBS before the elections, while he was an American citizen.  I was referring to keeping the media accountable from a citizen's perspective, like how Kyle Rittenhouse did it.",AstraVolans_21,2025-05-01T05:13:31,-2
I don‚Äôt think Paramount is going to be feeling much separation.  They are probably going to pay dearly to settle to avoid feeling the personal wrath of a vengeful President.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-30T15:32:34,-15

"Not sure. Maybe just publishing better information is best.  It‚Äôs not illegal for politicians to lie.  If it were, they‚Äôd all be in jail.  It‚Äôs also not illegal to edit someone‚Äôs words and take quotes out of context.   If Harris was deceptively defamed as a private citizen, she might sue for defamation, but that‚Äôs not what happened.  It‚Äôs not illegal to make someone look better than they are.  If it was, flattery would be against the law.  People keep talking about fraud, but what was stolen from whom?  I don‚Äôt think it qualifies as fraud.  In my opinion it was simply misinformation, which should be countered by more/better information.  Let the marketplace of ideas play out.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-30T20:25:40,5
