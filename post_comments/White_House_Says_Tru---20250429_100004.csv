"Guarantee this counts tens of thousands of employees that were improperly and illegally fired by elon only to be re-hired a week/month later.  Also worth pointing out that during the first year, Biden added an average of nearly 350k jobs a MONTH (4.1M jobs in 2021).  The following year was even stronger, adding an average 525k jobs a month (6.3M jobs in 2022)  These trump numbers, even being padded as they are, are bitch-made compared to Biden.",LW_GLAZER,2025-04-29T10:15:29,11

"""More than 275,000 layoffs announced last month, reaching a level not seen since the pandemic, according to a new report published Thursday.""  The system gets broken, and then judges demand these positions be reinstated, and now it magically looks like they've added 345,000 jobs when, in fact, this like most things from this administration is a lie. Forcing federal workers to sign NDAs and take on contractual work obligations isn't exactly as good as the original position they started with.   It's good for the CEO but no one else.  https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/economy/us-jobs-report-preview-march-doge-layoffs/index.html  https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/04/va-forces-staff-workforce-reduction-discussions-sign-non-disclosure-agreements/404808/",Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T10:13:30,5

Biden was our most pro-union president since FDR.   The media just absolutely decimated him most days or blatantly ignored the positives that made it through. He stuck with his pro-union message for 4 years and attempted to follow through even with a Republican-held majority.  https://theconversation.com/bidens-labor-report-card-historian-gives-union-joe-a-higher-grade-than-any-president-since-fdr-228771,Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T10:19:33,6
