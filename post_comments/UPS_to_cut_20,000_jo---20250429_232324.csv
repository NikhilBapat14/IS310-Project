"At least in my area, Amazon deliveries are almost entirely done by Amazon drivers now and have been for a few years. Is UPS still moving a lot of Amazon volume from ports and airports to warehouses?",smersh101,2025-04-29T23:48:46,8

"Teamster union members.

"I'm assuming this is because Amazon's own fleet keeps growing. A more worrying sign would be Amazon laying off their drivers. Otherwise, this is just the natural outcome (I presume) of Amazon doing it's own deliveries and no longer needing to rely so heavily on UPS.",MajorAstronaut7970,2025-04-30T00:13:37,4
It’s probably a geographic thing. Small rural areas aren’t going to build the infrastructure for Amazon drivers while metro will.,FluidBit4438,2025-04-30T00:44:39,3

"Kinda missing the point of my question. UPS doesn't actually appear to be delivering much for Amazon anymore (at least not ""last mile"" deliveries), so I'm curious why a reduction in Amazon business would suddenly require big layoffs. What are they doing for Amazon?",smersh101,2025-04-30T00:04:02,2
"I believe it depends on the proximity to Amazon's warehouses. Something like if you are in a density populated area, then it is a lot of Amazon trucks, If you are in a moderately populated area, then it is a blend of UPS and Amazon, and then the more remote you get the more that last mile is USPS as a sub contractor.   But if anyone works for Amazon can knows better I'd love to learn how it does work...",invalidreddit,2025-04-30T02:41:29,3
So what you’re saying is the more rural communities will have more immediate job loss. The schadenfreude is growing strong here.,shindekokoro,2025-04-30T03:39:13,3
"Postmaster DeJoy wants to run the Postal Service as a business with profits driving actions, not like an utility where narrowing costs is important but second to constant service. If understand it right, the Postmaster DeJoy took on the Amazon contract to help bring the Postal Service closer to breaking even, if not making a profit.  I've no idea how that deal was structured or even who wanted the 'deal' but if the Amazon was paying a flat rate for the service, regardless of the volume then not sure if it directly leads to trickle down layoffs until that contract is up for renewal. Then again I guess if the contract was paying out per delivery that would seem to be faster since the money in to USPS would be slowed down.  If profits are priory then headcount gets in the way so maybe not laying off the workers but slowing down the frequency of driving that last mile.",invalidreddit,2025-04-30T09:22:53,1
