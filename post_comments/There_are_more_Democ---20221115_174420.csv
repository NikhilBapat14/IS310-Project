"Let me answer your question with another question. How would you do that?  These are people we're talking about, not members of some political party that would uproot their entire lives just to win a couple more seats that aren't even guaranteed.   Even if you were passionate about some cause that a particular party aligns with, would *you* make that move? To Utah, Nebraska, Arkansas? And that's just on an individual level. Corporations move based off of their own interests such as economic climate, tax breaks, existing demographics (if say, google, moved their global headquarters to salt lake city, would they even be able to find workers to fill out their ranks?)  There's simply too many factors that go into your question that quite frankly don't make sense and conflate political parties with this all powerful organization when really they're not",Kryoxic,2022-11-16T08:28:08,80
"I hate Mitch McConnell as much as the next guy, but in no way am I uprooting my entire life and moving my family, leaving my job, my family, and my friends to move to Kentucky just in the hopes that others will follow and we can get a political victory that won't show up until after he retires anyway. Dem voters like living in diverse areas with well funded public services, interesting cultural opportunities, and fewer guns, just to name a few things. If North Dakota had those things, I guess I would consider moving if the opportunity was good enough, but you won't get those things until the leadership in those states starts supporting those things, which likely won't happen until the Dems start winning some key races.  This just isn't an attractive enough opportunity. The lack of some important Dem things is exactly why Dems don't want to move there, and telling them ""if we move there en masse then maybe we can build those things over time"" is a crappy sales pitch.",mormagils,2022-11-16T08:40:29,52
"It’s not as simple as just “moving” somewhere. You need a job, you need a place to live, if you have children you need a school. And forcing people to move just for the political benefits of adding D voters is ludicrous.  You could build up a plan like to go attract them, yeah, but it’s not simple by any means. Texas’s low taxes ended up attracting quite a few liberals in addition to conservatives. College education required jobs create places like San Francisco if you aren’t careful if having a balance of non-degree requiring jobs.   Is it possible? Yeah, I guess. But it’s not easy by any means and probably not worth it.",Zeddo52SD,2022-11-16T09:57:56,11

"Jobs.   What jobs exists? I mean sure you can work remotely but for non-high tech jobs, what are they supposed to do? Farms only need so many hands, major industry doesn't really exist except for in a few states. There's just no opportunity (for a massive influx of people)  It's like a small tourist town. Amazing to visit, but zero opportunity for anyone that isn't a doctor, or in the tourism industry.

"Because even if Democrats moved en mass to Republican states, the legislatures would probably just find ways to disenfranchise them.  Disagree with what I’m saying? The Supreme Court recently made the Voting Rights Act completely toothless. Do you really think they would enforce a freeze on implementing restrictive voting laws created by the same people who appointed them?

"There’s an easier way to do it. No one needs to move. Appeal to voters that currently don’t vote Democrat. It doesn’t have to be a change in issues or policy position. It can be a voter drive to get non voters to the polls. With the country so evenly divided, it doesn’t take many additional votes to win.",SurinamPam,2022-11-16T13:21:29,2
"If only my fellow progressives, liberals, and lefties would be as committed and organized as the Repubicans when it came to voting, we would never lose another major election.   Conservatism is the enemy of progress, by definition.   The GOP base has spiraled ever further right, and many party members are actively calling for Christofacism, or some iteration thereof.   Fascism is alive and well in the modern Repubican party... See for yourself.   14 TRAITS OF FASCISM: (EDIT: this is a copy paste from online)  Powerful and Continuing Nationalism:  Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights:  Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause:  The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  Supremacy of the Military:  Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  Rampant Sexism:  The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.  Controlled Mass Media:  Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  Obsession with National Security:  Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  Religion and Government are Intertwined:  Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.  Corporate Power is Protected:  The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  Labor Power is Suppressed:  Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .  Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts:  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  Obsession with Crime and Punishment:  Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  Rampant Cronyism and Corruption:  Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  Fraudulent Elections:  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",[deleted],2022-11-16T19:24:49,2

Either they got lucky with the housing market or they had a good down payment, or they still owned their original home. Moving isn’t cheap.

"What mattered is that his money went primarily to Democrats. What it said on his voting registration wasn't really relevant. Now, you can certainly argue - and Trump said this himself - that he was merely greasing the wheels and not expressing an ideological preference.  But that's precisely the point I'm making. If you live in a one party state, you have no choice but to work through that one party. It doesn't really say anything about your underlying political beliefs to be on the side of the guy who is going to win anyway.",ViskerRatio,2022-11-16T18:10:52,1

"So let's just work through the numbers of what this would actually look like. We want to swing the state of Arkansas. So you want $50k salary from the DNC to move there. The DNC would also have to kick in relocation expenses (I'm sure you aren't paying your own way there), and you'd certainly want employer sponsored healthcare as well and other benefits. So realistically the DNC has to pay you $75k (for a $50k salary plus benefits), and another ~$10-20k for moving expenses. But we'll just say $75k per year.   Biden lost Arkansas by 337k votes. So the DNC will need to pay $25 BILLION dollars annually to win Arkansas by a handful of votes. Realistically they'd need to spend $30-35 billion to ensure they win.  Considering the fact that the campaigns spend $14 billion over the entire campaign, you are doubling that number just to win a handful of electoral votes. And this doesn't address the potential illegality of the setup anyway.",ProLifePanda,2022-11-21T10:03:44,4
