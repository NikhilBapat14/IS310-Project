I’m not sure what the point of this is. It was wrong when Obama did it and it would be wrong if Trump does it.   It’s a weird argument to point to when democrats did something similar and go “see Trump can do it too.” Like with the tariffs. Pelosi and Bernie saying they’re a good idea doesn’t magically make them a good idea.   Pointing out when democrats do the same thing as some sort of justification isn’t a valid argument.

That their indignation is disingenuous and has no merit. That’s the point.,JiuJitsu_Ronin,2025-04-15T14:37:42,2
