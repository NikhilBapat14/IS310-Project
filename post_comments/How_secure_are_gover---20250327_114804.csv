"First off, use of Signal or any other commercial messaging app looks a lot like trying to bypass public records laws.  Second, they all have access to government issue secure communication channels.  They had no legitimate reason to use Signal.",kinkgirlwriter,2025-03-27T19:41:55,96
"> How should governments handle secure communications?  Through US Gov NIPR and SIPR networks.  > Can encrypted apps truly prevent leaks, or is human oversight the weakest link?  Humans are always the weakest link. Security is boring, slow, and cumbersome. Humans are lazy, impatient, and stupid.  > Should policymakers rethink how classified discussions are conducted?  No, they should follow established practices and procedures for discussing this.  WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.  We don't have the will.  > Curious to hear your thoughts—how should governments improve their approach to cybersecurity?  If a member of the US Military or Intelligence Agency leaked the details that SecDef and his cronies did, they'd lose their job, possibly facing prison time.  I think consequences should be levied.

"Consumer apps require trust in the parent company to follow strict security practices, i.e. not hotlinking to any external code library dependencies that could be modified without their knowledge, nor pushing any updates that may include similar 3rd party libraries, or other potential vectors for code exploit. But it's more the device it's on and the network it's connected to that will ultimately determine how secure any given app is.  Signal in particular is bad regardless of security since it can be configured not to comply with record retention laws.  Forcing people to use government devices and connect to government networks should remove a lot of the human error risks. But using in-house apps rather than 3rd party ones seems a no-brainer to easily eliminate a lot of the extra risks.",peetnice,2025-03-27T20:01:46,10
The signal leak has nothing to do with the security.  They have approved communication methods thay they chose not to use.  I dont imagine signal is approved for classified material and definately not the toppest of top secret like specifics of an air strike about to occur.  They would prosecute low level people willingly violating classification laws for confidential material.  Hegseth and co are flagrantly breaking the law.,Frank_Drebin,2025-03-28T06:42:20,4

"US government communications are pretty secure. The problem comes when people don't use the government's tools for communication. Republicans are famous for this, GW Bush used the RNC email servers when he was in office. Millions of official email communications were ""lost"".  Gov Walker of Wisconsin added a private wifi server in the Capitol, so he and his team could avoid using official wifi and could avoid having their communications saved.  And of course, many officials used private email servers, including Colin Powell, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, etc.  Although not in government, I had a similar problem since I traveled a lot for work. Do I carry two laptops, one for business and one for personal? Or do emails on one laptop for both purposes?  The Presidential Records Act specifies that President and Vice-President communications be preserved and kept by the National Archives. It was the National Archives who requested the SCIF documents Trump stole and hid at Mar-a-Lago. Trump has since fired those people when he got back into office.  The Vice-President using a commercial app to discuss classified secrets is illegal, and not saving the records is also illegal. In the Trump administration though, that means nothing. Trump himself is a convicted felon, and found liable for fraud and sexual assault.",billpalto,2025-03-28T09:22:58,1

"Well considering TOP SECRET SCI documents were stored in a Mar A Largo bathtub and on a wedding ballroom stage for over a year in a hotel resort and spa visited heavily by Russians, secured with only a $20 Home Depot door lock....I'd say U.S. security is a total disaster.  The issue is not that this clown show cast accidentally added a political pundit to an EXTREMELY top secret chat group. The issue is that they are so insanely incompetent and unqualified that they didn't know that it was mind  boggling stupid do discuss timing of a military strike on an Apple App store downloadable messaging app in the first place.

">How should governments handle secure communications?  The gov't handels secure comms just fine everyday. There are policies that require the use of encryption when emailing what's called Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). You also have a whole seperate internet called SIPRNet which is for sharing and gathering Secret informafion. Then you have Top Secret (TS) which also has it's own networks. Finally there are Special Access Programs (SAP) which can also have unique networks.  >Can encrypted apps truly prevent leaks, or is human oversight the weakest link?  Encryption is not enough. For instance, Signal has a feature that lets yoy link your PC to your account. If someones phone was hacked, then a bad actor could link a PC without the other person knowing, and no amount of encryption would matter. This is why the app is not approved for operational use. It's meant to be used when you're going to be 15 mins late coming in to the office. Not for letting your coworkers know when the Houthis are getting attacked.  >Should policymakers rethink how classified discussions are conducted?  Nope.

They can start by owning their mistakes.",RnotSPECIALorUNIQUE,2025-03-28T06:42:46,1
"Government is always the last to adopt security and efficiency.  Was watching the Bret Baer interview with the Doge leaders and someone mentioned records are still being kept on paper files in an underground mine.  I’m an old guy and as soon as computers came in I transferred all my file cabinet stuff into computer memory. I back it up and when I get a new computer, I transfer all the files to the new one. I started doing it 20 years ago. Saves space! I can send files to anyone electronically or print out what I need.  Why is the Trump administration still dealing with file cabinets for these records?",baxterstate,2025-03-28T08:31:16,1
"Government communications are no more secure than private ones. They haven't remade the wheel here. It's just the advantage of having a bigger budget to build as many networks as needed.    The only added security is isolating their hidden networks and limiting direct access to white listed people and devices. But I digress.  How should governments handle secure communications?   For electronic communications, white listed devices, with restricted admin access or to add applications, seem pretty standard. You can rig the phone with a VPN to a controlled government server(s) to pull and send data.   Anything in person ... I mean, we built SKIFs for a reason.   Can encrypted apps truly prevent leaks, or is human oversight the weakest link?   I mean, encryption can be broken ... it's just usually much easier to phish phone numbers, emails, and sometimes just leaving a USB stick in an office building. I'm too lazy to look up the figures, but I want to say it is 90% or more of data breaches because of a human element.    Should policymakers rethink how classified discussions are conducted?

"Signal comes preloaded on most government devices.

"There's no possibly.  The law is 5 years per document.  The government has in the past tried to use every single individual message in a chat channel as a separate document.  That could potentially be a lifetime (or death) sentence for every single participant in that chat except for the reporter.  And even if they didn't get that, it would be a revocation of their clearance, and a dishonorable discharge (likely with reduction in rank) for any military member in that chat.",Aazadan,2025-03-28T18:45:30,5
"I mean, the first step is recognizing the insane degree to which each and every person in that chat messed up, and making them all resign, to confirm new nominees that can actually follow proper established communications protocol.      Anything less is to say security doesn't matter.      This is a solved problem, the hardware exists, the software exists, the network exists.  The government owns all of that right now, and everyone is required to use it as part of their clearances to discuss classified or otherwise sensitive information.      Just as how classification flows downward, so do breaches.  Lax security at the top propagates throughout, and renders all information insecure.  If that were a security test, every single one of them failed catastrophically.   As a matter of national security they need replaced.",Aazadan,2025-03-28T18:56:24,2
"No they're not.  Government leads the way with security policies.  Governments have the most secure systems out there.  They have to for military communications, for things like nuclear weapons, and so on.  There's an entire defense industry built around working within information standards for cui, secret, top secret, and more.  And single fuckups can destroy entire companies or individuals careers even without clearance.  This is the single biggest failure in US history given the number of breaches and the positions of those involved.  Worse, is that it showed it to be business as usual and not some poorly thought out one off event.      Also, if you need long term storage, paper is far superior to digital.  Digital communications are some of the worst kept pieces of media in existence.  An SSD holds data while powered off for about 3-5 years.  A CD typically degrades after 7, a DVD after 10.

"Using commercial cell phones and apps is absolutely a risk factor. A dozen different actors could put in some kind of backdoor: hardware manufacturers, Google, network operators, the developers of the app you're using, any *other* apps on your phone with high enough permissions (eg screen reading).   People can just deploy software updates to your phone without you even realising. Even if your phone was secure yesterday, which you have to no way to really verify, it might not be today.    National security information should not be going via these devices at all. Any mobile devices being used should be government security audited, explicitly whitelisted and have only apps audited to be secure and be locked from updates that haven't also been audited.    Also, modern encryption *can't* really be broken to our knowledge. You just work around it in some way - compromise an endpoint generally.   Additionally, using a locked down system limits human error in a big way. 12 year olds use Signal at school. I use Signal. Everyone else with Signal in your contacts is available to text. Anyone with Signal can fat finger their phone into ending their text message to Papa John. You can't do that with a secure system because only people with some security clearance are even on it at all.",Banes_Addiction,2025-03-27T23:02:45,8

Going back to Signal, even if you could somehow argue that Signal allows for such information, it would only do so in an environment where the device in question was on SIPR (or other similar network), the recipients were also all on SIPR, and an outside person such as that journalist couldn't even be on the same networks to communicate, so even if they were accidentally invited, the invite would never send, and even if it somehow did, they couldn't join.

Highly targeted individuals should assume that all communications between mobile devices—including government and personal devices—and internet services are at risk of interception or manipulation.

In cases where organizations do not, apply the following best practices to your mobile devices.**  Yes or no to each:  1. Do you think the USA Department of Defense *doesn't* already have its own best practices in place?  2. Do you think this document applies to highly classified materials, like military plans?  3.

"Incorrect.  Classified information, as well as unclassified sensitive information such as things like CUI or other unclassified but non public security information needs to be on secured systems.      This involves things like SCIF's in some cases (for this information, certainly, as all classified info requires that), it requires using government devices, using government networks.  This was on signal, on private devices, over public networks.  While signal itself is generally considered secure as an app, it's not considered secure enough for any actually important communications.  The phones themselves are the most frequent point of failure, but also the networks like cell towers are a problem.      In addition to that, everyone with a clearance is responsible for security.  Not a single person in there verified the identities of those in the chat, and all were witness to it having not happened.  That's a massive breach.  None were concerned with where others were communicating from, another breach.  The message deletion policy means no records kept, another breach.  Failure to notice the change in number of participants in the chat, another breach.  Discussing military strikes and carrying them out without presidential authorization, another breach as these are illegal orders.      See the problem?  And every single one of them failed.  Being party to someone handling such information incorrectly is considered equally guilty to the person who messed up.      If it's a fast moving situation (it wasn't, they had days to discuss), they should have been in a secure facility to discuss this stuff.  They weren't.

This was primarily done over the phone or radio which wasn’t exactly foolproof secure.  They typically had to deal with convoluted CYA orders like “you can kill Bin Laden, but you can’t want to kill him” because they couldn’t get top decision makers on the line, so they erred on the side of caution and didn’t do anything until airliners were flying into skyscrapers.  Wouldn’t it have been great if they had the technology to get all the decisions makers on an encrypted line, regardless of where they were, to say they have the target so discuss and decide now to either execute or not?

This is pointing out the partisan performative pearl clutching and falling over fainting couches over a minor spillage from an easily avoidable mistake that would have compromised the security in most systems.  Despite that this encrypted technology was used for a rapid response to successful take out high threat targets.  It was appropriate used for deliberations and timely decisions as no classified details like until names, exact location, and methods used were discussed on it.  That was the actual “war plans” part made in a SCIF while this was just a general discussion and a SITREP on the execution of those plans from top decision makers.  These opportunities don’t present themselves at the most convenient times nor do they carry a SCIF on their back at all times either.  Unfortunately given the flash point that set this all in motion was when a top target went to their girlfriend’s house had to be mentioned.  This would imply we didn’t have eye on the target, but his girlfriend.  That is sensitive information that could expose a vital intel source.

The actual “war plans” were absolutely discussed in a SCIF with top brass prior.  This was mainly deliberations and then a SITREP when things kicked off for the top decision makers.  The VP’s reservation could have easily held this up to where they missed the opportunity to take out the high profile target going to their girlfriends house.

"Incorrect, it was classified.  However, lets not even argue that right now and lets pretend it was unclassified.      Unclassified information is going to fall into one of a few categories, CUI information, sensitive information, non public information, and public information.      As this wasn't discussed over public channels, or steps made to ensure it isn't going public we know it's not public information.      Non public information, is the only category for which Signal is approved, this is allowed for information that is only indirectly related to work performed such as messaging your boss to say you're going to be late to work, or chatting with some coworkers about non work information, non government data basically.  So we know it's also not that.    That leaves CUI and sensitive information.  Both of these have the same requirements as classified information regarding access controls, networks a device can be connected to, records retention, and so on.      If it could successfully be shown that nothing was classified, while that would mean none of those participants are guilty of the laws which would put them in jail for the rest of their lives, they're still guilty of 5 other crimes, all of which come with fines and prison time, and any of which for a single failure should bring serious questions about if the person should hold their position.

Not even remotely similar to Clinton’s knowingly retaining years of State Dept classified information in her residence on a wide open unmonitored server with bare minimal protection.  I certainly see the political implications of wanting it to be that bad, but the facts do not support that at all.

If the SecDef won’t be held accountable for adhering to DoD policy, what kind of example does that set for our military and how unserious does it make us look to the world?  Anyone with an iota of common sense and love for this country should be calling for Hegseth’s resignation.",BettisBus,2025-04-02T15:41:18,2
"> I’ve made it plenty clear my argument is “Hegseth sharing **classified** (or, if you’d rather, I can use the word **sensitive**) military plans over a Signal groupchat is improper.” > >Has anyone in the Trump admin said under oath the materials discussed in the Signal groupchat are absolutely not **classified**?  You are conflating the words and using them interchangeably.  Clearly an attempt to make this more serious than it is in reality.  This policy deliberation was encrypted and contained no specific that would have put the mission at risk.  Only hyper partisans are calling for Hegseth’s resignation because the mistake here wasn’t made by him, but by Waltz.",Fargason,2025-04-02T16:18:05,1
"You have zero understanding of why we handle sensitive *and/or* classified materials with special procedures. “Known terrorist Johnny Badguy ate animal crackers for lunch today” might not seem like it should be sensitive or classified. However, if this got out, Badguy’s organization now knows *someone* who knew what he ate for lunch is an informant. The informant might be found out and killed. Or the source is burned, no longer willing to risk informing under higher scrutiny. Both create chilling effects for future informants coming forward to help us make plans on the geopolitical chessboard, weakening our position in the world.  You can live in your world of arguing on technicalities in the most redditor way possible, but in the real world, people can actually give a shit about actions like these without you projecting your own partisan motives onto them. Speaking of, still waiting on a criticism of Trump’s admin.",BettisBus,2025-04-02T16:30:45,2
