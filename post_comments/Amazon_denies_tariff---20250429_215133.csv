">Amazon now denies reports it planned to list how much tariffs increased products' prices after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed the move as a ""hostile and political act.""  >Why it matters: The reported plan further suggests a growing rift between businesses and President Trump, who has made aggressive tariffs and a global trade war central to his economic agenda.  >Trump's massive 145% tariffs on Chinese imports will hit Amazon hard because 60% of its sales come from smaller, independent retailers often heavily reliant on imports.  It's now ""Hostile and Political"" to tell the truth!! lol",StupidizeMe,2025-04-29T21:53:30,5
