"Honestly kind of 50/50 on this.  MAYBE Trump could be useful to Putin in exile spewing bullshit online BUT he could also be useful in death.  Putin could have had him killed but try to set it up as if it was a Democrat assassination. Then he could have tried to put in a younger more competent crony in his place to attempt to rally the MAGA base behind that person against the Democrats. Regardless of if this worked he could likely very easily turn the US into complete chaos and violence if not full blown civil war. Sure he could TRY to do that with Trump still alive in exile but that would require him actually taking care of Trump, keeping him protected AND actually controlling the bullshit coming out of Trump's mouth which is frankly a lot of work and I don't think Putin would want to actually deal with Trump being around him in person. Not to mention protecting Trump could escalate US support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia even more than having a Democrat in office would already.  Trump doesn't need to be alive to sow dissent and home-grown terrorism from the MAGA base, if anything him being alive might actually prevent it to some degree.
