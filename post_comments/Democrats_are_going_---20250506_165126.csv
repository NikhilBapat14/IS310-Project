Go read what Hogg himself has said.    https://x.com/davidhogg111/status/1629964651797573635?lang=en,account128927192818,2025-05-06T19:38:10,2
"Few are advocating for total gun bans, but that doesn't mean they are advocating for positive effective gun control. Some of the most popular gun control proposals are either completely ineffective at preventing gun deaths, and/or attempts to dissuade gun ownership through death by 1,000 cuts. Think of it as the equivalent of Republicans not banning abortion, but banning any abortion clinics from operating within x distance from a church, or school, or bus stop, to the point where there are little to no places a clinic can legally operate, despite abortion still technically being legal.  The best example with gun control is assault weapon bans. One of the most popular proposals among Democrats is banning so called ""assault weapons"". This is despite the fact that virtually all gun murders, 90% are committed with handguns vs rifles of any kind including assault weapons at 5%. Rifles kill so few people that if an AWB saved every single one of them (including those committed by rifles not targeted by the ban), it wouldn't make a measurable impact on the overall murder rate. More Americans are killed by unarmed assailants punching/kicking them to death, as opposed to all rifle murders.   Another that has universal support among Democrats is banning those on the no-fly list from owning guns. This is despite the fact that the no-fly list is an extra-judiciary policy that those impacted have never been charged with a crime, and have little to no recourse to appeal the decision. The only reason the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional, was because you don't have a protected right to fly in an airplane. The same is not true about owning a gun. They can't take away your guns for being in a secret watch list that you don't even have to be a criminal to be on.   Another example is allowing victims of gun violence to sue gun manufacturers. The goal of this is to allow people to sue manufacturers into bankruptcy. There was a big push because the parents of some of the children killed on Sandy Hook sued Remington the maker of the gun used. The thing is a gun manufacturer is no more liable for someone going on a shooting with their gun, than an alcohol manufacturer is for DUIs. Especially in the case of Sandy Hook, he didn't even buy the gun. It was his mom's, he murdered her and then stole it. In no way is Remington at all responsible for that.",CombinationRough8699,2025-05-07T17:00:33,2

"Thanks for the link, and I disagree with him, but you can't seriously believe that there is any danger whatsoever of either the Democratic party changing the gun control policies they advocate to agree with Hogg.   Gun culture in America has gone off the rails in recent decades, and gun control laws to try to undo some of that insanity are a good idea, but there is no scenario that is remotely plausible in which you won't be able to own a gun.   And therefore ""gun control in the rise of fascism"" isn't problematic.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-06T19:51:09,1

"Do you understand the system is flawed where voters get the shaft? Do you understand that saying nothing, doing nothing will give us the exact same thing we got in Nov?

Why not put your efforts into writing the party and relaying what the sentiments are of voters and urge them to step up? Why not participate in efforts to change the system instead of screaming at other voters who may not have the luxury of accepting whatever the party hands us? Whose side are you on? Why is it so painful for some of you to accept that these times call for far better quality representatives? Why is it that voters must whittle down their values to tiny nubs in order to fit what the party decides is important or not?

"> Why is it so painful for some of you to accept that these times call for far better quality representatives?  I can agree with that and still understand that the only way to do that is within the Democratic party, because of how our system works. I can wish we had a better system that enabled having multiple smaller parties that have to form coalitions, while also understanding that we don't have that.   I can agree that we need better representatives and still understand that if the choice in the general election is a status-quo conservative corporate Zionist Democrat or a maga Republican, anyone who wants to achieve progressive goals (and who understands how voting works) should vote for the Democrat.    I can understand all of the above and still be happy to see primary challenges that try to give us a better choice on the Democratic side.  Note that AOC would agree with all of the above. In one interview she talked about the importance of supporting Biden -- *even in the face of stark disagreement over his handling of the Gaza genocide* -- because of how deeply destructive a second Trump administration would be.   She was right. That's because she's smart, she's pragmatic, she understands how our political system works, she understands how destructive a fascist regime can be, *and she wants to achieve progressive goals*.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-07T12:09:24,3

Do the ones who suffer the most matter to the fellow voters in our party? How do we know? What do we tell them when they are literally dying from bad policy. Literally dying. We can't just approach this question from where we, individually, sit right now.Some are sitting in a much dire place, hanging on every development in gov because their fate is for others to decide. How do we tell them sorry, but you just have to suffer. Our system is what it is and you could have it much worse under Trump? We have a responsibility. At least I think we do.
