Giving Pence a courage award for Jan. 6 is like giving a kid a medal for doing his homework—while the rest of the class was setting the school on fire. Congrats on meeting the bare minimum!,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-05T05:49:18,168
I'd be more impressed had he continued the fight against Trump... instead he's done almost nothing. Probably because he's complicit with a lot of things he doesn't want us to know about from the first Trump term.,MasterOfManyWorlds,2025-05-05T08:34:19,18
He's so brave! Though somehow not quite brave enough to even mention Trump once during his speech.,Tyrannical-Botanical,2025-05-05T05:51:01,35
The bar is so low in U.S. politics to the point where a clown like this can be awarded for the less-than bare minimal opposition to what’s happening currently without him even being brave enough to call out those responsible for the chaos,Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-05T06:40:55,24
"Can this one act, that is granted courageous and probably did save the US democracy from collapse, make up for decades of serving the party who's politics brought about the conditions for a fascist coup in the US and who, ultimately, supported this coup? ",Goodk4t,2025-05-05T06:04:31,6

We will relive this story word for word except with mcconnell whenever he finally leaves. All ex trump staff all have the same story. There is nothing new about it. 45 is living sludge that thinks its cute and funny to ignore the constitution.  We already know. His base doesn’t care. What we need isnt another tell all book about how bad it is. We need someone that is willing to do something that actually *stops* him.",blackmobius,2025-05-05T12:35:41,0

Frankly many people did not do their jobs that day and Pence didn’t cave under the pressure. He didn’t sprint away like Hawley or give away legislators positions like MTG. why are people posting this same comment on all the pence posts?  Is this the new virtue signal or something? It’s a terrible comment that should not be idea regurgitated. Not sure who got karma for the comment the first time but don’t think it’s garnering the same support anymore  Learn to think for yourself instead of copying popular comments,beadzy,2025-05-05T09:21:31,16

"In the current environment there are many situations it takes a lot of courage for people to do the right thing even when doing the right thing is also that person's job. We are counting on some of these people to get through this, and there is no reason to diminish what they have done.   A relatively small handful of Republicans doing ""the bare minimum"" would go a long way right now and I'm happy to give them some awards for doing it. ",spleeble,2025-05-05T15:29:37,4

He ran against him in the primary (and lost). Then he formed a PAC to advocate against Robert F. Kennedy jr. as HHS secretary. Seems pretty solid to me.,Karmonit,2025-05-05T12:05:46,3
"The last time he went against Trump's wishes, a mob set up outside the building, erected a gallows, and then stormed the building.  I disagree with almost all of Pence's politics, but can give him a pass on not calling Trump out by name.",SomeDEGuy,2025-05-05T07:42:42,-2
It bought us 4 more years to keep Trump out of power and then we never held him accountable and here we are,geekstone,2025-05-05T11:41:28,4
"Again, Pence *ran against Trump* in the primary. And not like Ramaswamay where it was just a publicity stunt, he genuinely opposed him and emphasised his actions on Jan. 6th as the reason people should vote for him. What more were you expecting?",Karmonit,2025-05-05T12:07:25,0

"As you said, the man has done so many things worthy of hate.  But when he had the chance to break the rules and get what he wanted, he didn't.  It's a shame that is such a high bar that it's worthy of recognition, but he gave us a chance at not going down the road we find ourselves on.  Could be doing more, but the same could be said about a lot of political leaders",silver0199,2025-05-05T09:39:36,4
> He could have bailed with the secret service when he had the chance.  He wasn't confident about where that ride was headed.,AINonsense,2025-05-05T07:40:33,44

"People are shitting on Pence because he was and still is an absolute ghoul. He fanned the flames of Trump's bullshit right until it was about to burn him. He's a religious zealot who has wet dreams over Project 2025 making America into a Christofascist hellhole, and doing the right thing on Jan 6th doesn't wash away the immense amount of bad shit his political career has put on regular people.  He's awful, truly fucking awful.",SadFeed63,2025-05-05T09:29:27,14
"Yeah I dont think he’s a good person, and he failed us in so many ways as VP. But he did do the right thing that one time on Jan 6 and I’m grateful for that.   Sure, he probably partly made the choice to stay because he didn’t trust the secret service. But he also knew that there was a violent crowd calling for his hanging, heading his way - and he stayed and certified the election anyways.   Frankly, I don’t think there’s a single Republican who would do the same if Jan 6 happened now. JD Vance certainly wouldn’t.",_violet_skies_,2025-05-05T11:12:07,7

Pence is clearly very conservative and I get people on here don't like that. But ultimately the point is that he respects democracy. He will fight for his point of view but he accepts when the majority goes the other way.  That's how it's supposed to be. You can't expect everyone to agree with you on stuff like abortion or gay marriage. But you can expect them to support democracy and the rule of law.,Karmonit,2025-05-05T12:04:24,7
Dan Quayle giving Pence advice on what to do does not somehow make Pence not courageous for going through with it. Don't understand why people keep pushing this nonsense.,Karmonit,2025-05-05T17:36:47,1
He didn't campaign for Trump either. I don't see that as a big issue.,Karmonit,2025-05-05T13:57:46,-1

"I personally think you're giving him too much credit and ""very conservative"" doesn't cover how conservative, and particularly how evangelical he is. Just because he did one thing doesn't erase his past, and while he's been lower key since the Trump admin, he's still a warrior fighting the right wing culture war. He was made a visiting fellow by the Heritage Foundation, *after* Jan 6 (so it's not as if he saw the light on right wing fascism). The same Heritage Foundation who are responsible for Project 2025 (and Project 2025 is shit he absolutely agrees with). I mean, there was a time when people were saying ""Pence is worse than Trump, if Trump does die"" because Pence is and was readily known as such a true believer type  He sucks. Good for him for doing the right thing, but he's a monster too and I don't think that should be forgotten",SadFeed63,2025-05-05T12:47:10,4
Because Pence isn't some blushing innocent. We're all sick of his pious bullshit when he WAS IN ON THE WHOLE THING FOR FOUR YEARS.,Recipe_Freak,2025-05-06T00:08:16,1
"Is ""courage"" is skin deep. He paid nothing for it. That's fine, but, when you compare him to people who lost jobs, careers, we're threatened etc. kinda makes the award seen silly.    Congrats, your the 18th bravest Republican. Your ""act"" of heroism accomplished nothing, and when you had a chance to showcase real courage by going across the isle and supporting a forever opponent against a man you knew was dangerous, antithetical to American values and institutions, you chose to do nothing. Here's an award. ",pasterhatt,2025-05-05T14:11:28,1
What was there even to leak? Trump was conducting his plan out in the open. Everyone knew about it already.,Karmonit,2025-05-05T12:02:03,2

"> Is ""courage"" is skin deep. He paid nothing for it. That's fine, but, when you compare him to people who lost jobs, careers, we're threatened etc. kinda makes the award seen silly.   You can't be serious. Pence wanted to become president. He ruined his entire political career; MAGA hates him forever now. Not to mention all the death threats etc. Why would you downplay that? >Congrats, your the 18th bravest Republican. Your ""act"" of heroism accomplished nothing  It was actually extraordinarily important.

You don't go from VP to anything but a corporate board member.   You're applauding him for not breaking the law. I understand your point. If he broke the law, and committed a coup, it would have been bad. I agree.   You don't get an award for not breaking the law. If, after he saw that his political life was over, like pretty much everyone did, he then campaigned extensively for the person who wasn't going to break America, I'd laud his courage. He had the option, and he passed.",pasterhatt,2025-05-05T14:22:32,1
