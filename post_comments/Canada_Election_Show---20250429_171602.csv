It's becoming increasingly clear that Trump's America First approach has turned some our key allies against us and disrupted long-standing trade relationships.,InterestingLife8149,2025-04-29T17:20:22,45
"According to a certain conservative sub, Pierre Poilievre and the conservative party lost because they're not conservative enough.  They're saying Polievre is actually far left.  lol. So much copium.",BlotchComics,2025-04-29T17:39:09,32
"I am Canadian: fuck Trump and fuck America.   Hands off my country and remember, we are not your friends.",lcdr_hairyass,2025-04-29T17:31:13,42
"Thanks to Trumpâ€™s insanity that he has demonstrated in only the past 100 days, we already have an example of a country successfully resisting the right-wing wave sweeping across the globe. Goes to show that the faster that rightwingers act in an insane way, the quicker people realize how necessary it is to resist them. Doubt this will be the last case of this happening",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-04-29T17:27:22,12
It's doing exactly what Conservatives want though. For the US to isolate itself from other countries. Even if it's a detriment to everyone involved.,Politicsmakemehorny1,2025-04-29T17:20:36,14
I welcome any opportunity to kick trump and MAGA right in the teeth.,kh-38,2025-04-29T19:28:14,3
"Trump is the savior of the Canadian Liberal partyâ€”a Liberal hero, if you will! His meddling in Canadian politics resulted in an unprecedented 25-point shift in party support. This might just make Trump the greatest Liberal influencer ever!",Hot_Cheesecake_905,2025-04-29T18:30:53,3

"Threatening to annex, and declaring an economic war against your neighbor does tend to piss them off for some reason.  Canada will never forgive or forget.",Life-Topic-7,2025-04-29T17:51:51,32
"Far left?? ðŸ˜†   Oh, well since he needs someone to give up their seat so he can take it, maybe he should ask an NDP to hand over their seat.ðŸ˜‚",Phoenixlizzie,2025-04-29T17:48:52,7
No one really believes thatâ€¦ PP lost because he did not shift to the center quick enough.,Hot_Cheesecake_905,2025-04-29T18:33:28,3

Canâ€™t fault you. Sorry weâ€™ve let the wrong people guide our destiny.,industrial-complex,2025-04-29T17:51:43,10
We deserve that. Too many of us stayed home instead of voting against a tyrant.,kh-38,2025-04-29T19:30:00,3

"Carney had a simple message and well qualified.  US democrats canâ€™t unite on anything. Itâ€™s like there is a divide between Biden and Bernie. Ddems should Â not align themselves with things like defund the police, BLM, transgender issues.  Just small incremental changes would be ok. Make flying safe, keep our national parks, build more hosing and work on infrastructureÂ ",KunaiForce,2025-04-30T00:11:28,1
"True fucking story.  For Trump to say heâ€™s the leader(he means King) of America and the leader of the world, was detrimental to his malicious and self aggrandizing goals.  He inspired every other country to clamp down on their principles and lock their fucking doors to the United States.  MAGAts donâ€™t care. They are so consumed with thinking everything outside the four corners of their house is enemy territory, they donâ€™t care if thatâ€™s all they ever see in this life. Oh, and the inside of their coal rolling truk.   But for the rest of us, he is ruining the freedoms we take for granted to travel unimpeded, welcomed even, in foreign lands.",industrial-complex,2025-04-29T17:49:58,6
"According to Wikipedia, while he supported Hitler early on, he actually spoke out against antisemitism, even creating an organised movement among pastors. He was arrested and sent to a camp because of his opposition, as early as 1937.  Thanks for sharing his name, I had never known who wrote this.",Wild_Black_Hat,2025-04-30T10:00:08,1
"To be clear, threatening to annex is just fancy-talkin' for ""Go to war"".  So it was an economic war and a literal war being threatened.  The economic war has since been declared - we are still waiting to see about the literal one.    Canadians are not happy about that.",BadgeOfDishonour,2025-04-29T22:00:04,7
"I'd love to see him wander around the House, looking for a seat, only to get the Forrest Gump treatment of ""Taken"".    I know that's not how it works.  But it would amuse me nonetheless.",BadgeOfDishonour,2025-04-29T22:01:25,1
