"The democratic party is a failure that we have to move past clinging to. They do not and have not served the will of their constituents.

Your average Democratic politician will let this slide like Biden and Garland, slaps on the wrists that will be undone by the next Republican, because Democrats have no ideology besides appeasing corporate donors and making the barbaric policies of Republicans only slightly less barbaric so the system chugs along.",ForsakenKrios,2025-04-28T12:37:21,9
"A system wherein exploiting a single human life is unacceptable. A system wherein the government does its job of providing for the safety, health, and security of citizens, and in exchange the citizens allow that government to continue improving their lives.   The ultimate power must always lie with the people, not the state. The second that switches, the people become subjects of the state, and are therein allowed to exist by its permission.   Humans do not need the government‚Äôs permission to exist or to take care of themselves. Governments need their human‚Äôs permission to exist.  That fact has been forgotten, and must be remembered.",slowTXbrz,2025-04-28T14:11:34,5
"They have already allowed him and his admin unlimited power.  They have already *LEGALLY* decided he was immune from prosecution as president. He‚Äôs been impeached four times, about to be five. He doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck how popular he is. He gets at least 3.5 more years, unless Vp takes over which will only accelerate the timeline.   He has ALREADY destroyed elections. That happened a while back.   I‚Äôm sorry friend, but wake up. The institutions your faith is in are *already* gone, and if you don‚Äôt see that you haven‚Äôt been paying enough attention.
