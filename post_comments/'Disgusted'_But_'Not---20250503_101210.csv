"Tom Homan has a habit of threatening officials, he recently wanted to arrest OAC, who responded by saying come get me.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-03T10:16:43,291
"Tell Homan to come get him, and Evers’ State Police will be waiting.",Traditional-Win-3368,2025-05-03T10:29:22,90
MMW there will be a massive personal scandal and Homan will get canned in the next 2 years.  Dude def has skeletons in his closet.,Darkstar197,2025-05-03T10:44:22,69
"This is the way to deal with fascists.   Their threats of violence will always begin as implied. And becsue they're implied, they won't be seen doing them.   You need to force them to make their mistakes. You need to be brave and to force them to reveal the kind of craven, sick fools they are.   Yes, it's scary. But it must be done. If you do not, you capitulate in advance. You give them the power based on their threats, rather than their actions, and they can claim plausible deniability. ""See? We didn't even do anything, he just gave us what we were askin because he saw reason.""",StoppableHulk,2025-05-03T11:58:11,65
Why does Tom Homan get to threaten good folks like he does?,jwr1111,2025-05-03T10:53:46,39

Every Judge and Senator should essentially do this. Force them to cross that Rubicon and see where that gets them. There will substantial resistance.,SubterrelProspector,2025-05-03T15:11:02,8
This is intriguing,Something-clever2087,2025-05-03T13:23:45,6
Kudos to a Governor who is trying to send clear instructions to public employees on how to address ICE if they are approached. It is important for everyone to know their rights and make sure to contact your attorney due to the many illegal actions by this Administration.  Imagine they are trying to destroy our Constitutional rights and not be held accountable. This must be stopped and the judiciary must stand strong to enforce the rule of law.,Sea-Bandicoot-5329,2025-05-03T22:26:03,5

Government officials making these threats under the color of their authority should be charged with official oppression.,Do-you-see-it-now,2025-05-04T01:08:24,1
Homan is a threat to our National Security and should be treated as such. Impeachment now.,racingwthemoon,2025-05-04T11:13:20,1
That man looks like an orc. ,Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-03T10:20:48,103
That lady is a dynamo! If they did in fact actually and stupidly arrest her there would be massive protests across the US. She is loved by so many and rightfully so.,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-03T12:29:10,45

I would absolutely believe he has skeletons in his closet.  I would even believe they are *literal*.  I am less sold on the idea that there is *any* scandal beyond the personal whims of the orange man that will get someone in this administration canned.,TheFeshy,2025-05-03T11:03:32,55

"I mean do it as long as you know you can win. That can backfire if you push back in a situation where they have all the control, then it makes them look even stronger.   I don't imagine trump can do anything to a state governor, but if he does we're way into civil war territory. Seems like all talk from maga. He'll probably cut some kind of funding for Wisconsin though because of this.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-03T17:25:57,4

The firing is because he had reporters and Democrat names in his phone. Trump feared he was a leaker.  The UN gig is temporary so Trump doesn't look weak.,77NorthCambridge,2025-05-03T14:00:44,12

I'm usually disappointed by the democrats but Walz is giving me hope that there is a real path forward for the party.
