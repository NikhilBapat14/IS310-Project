"Laudable and understandable given our fiscal problems. Sorry, but it isn't going to happen. China in particular is in the middle of a strategic nuclear build-up (among every other facet of defense spending). They didn't ramp up production only to shut it down prematurely in order to please the USA.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T07:43:28,146
"Considering that both China and Russia are proven liars and cheats, this is a path we shouldn't be on because we would actually do it while they secretly kept enough of theirs.   Us disarming ourselves while trusting them would be beyond dangerous.",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-27T09:05:35,38
Didn't Ukraine give up its nukes?,Algum,2025-04-27T15:34:54,14
"As much as I love Trump, this’ll NEVER happen. I hate to say it but this is dumb decision making on his part. China and Russia are the only two nuclear super powers in that continental area. Just like tariffs, they’re a negotiating tool. As a matter of fact, their nuclear arsenal is THE BEST tool both countries have in their deck.   Trump shouldn’t pursue this. It’s just not feasible.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-27T07:46:21,59
"Ignoring the fact that neither is trustworthy, I'm not sure a world where North Korea and (very soon) are the only ones with nukes. Total waste of time.",cathbadh,2025-04-27T12:42:32,6
"I hope he doesn’t believe anything China says. They would love to make some “agreement” on this, then just keep going as they are.",jcr2022,2025-04-27T08:03:36,17
"Defense is not the place for cuts.  It’s been ridiculously neglected in terms of sustainment, modernization and training time.  Money savings need to come from eliminating FWA aggressively, not budget cuts.",KevtheKnife,2025-04-27T07:48:58,12
Good. Hopefully this can work,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-04-28T02:21:12,2
"Good idea. When they refuse, Trump will (rightfully) assume that if they only want to increase their budgets, they want war. Gives us a great excuse to radically increase the military budget.  Edit: To all the brigading leftist haters and losers downvoting, I'm sorry that I would prefer America to have a military strong enough to prevent war. Si vis pacem, para bellum.",AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-04-27T07:54:01,-19
"Need a SALT III treaty with China, like the ones with the Soviet Union.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T08:34:42,15
"Agree, Russia isn’t going to give up the only thing that’s preventing them from getting their asses kicked.",dottedoctet,2025-04-27T08:58:29,34
100%. Russia has an economy the size of Italy and less human capital than just one of our states. They’d be an absolute afterthought without their nukes,hercdriver4665,2025-04-27T09:35:20,22
"If the FwA within the defense industry and the military was addressed why wouldn’t they be able to accomplish the same amount with less funding, or at least no raise in funding.",MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-27T10:38:15,4
It's already at a trillion dollars a year. We could def cut it a lot. Just sic DOGE on the DOD,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-04-28T02:21:50,1
"Our military is very strong and has all the funds nessecary to be even stronger than it is now. Its rampant waste fraud and abuse of the system and taxpayer money that are holding us back, throwing more money at the problem only allows it to be sucked away into the pockets of the fraduders with no appreciable benefit to our military.",MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-27T10:40:31,11
"While we were busy trying to pass Salt II in the senate, Russia invaded Afghanistan. Time and time again, they have proved we can trust them at their word.",DandierChip,2025-04-27T10:33:31,27
Because the same amount is not enough to meet current day national security needs.  Recent example: 70% of Army Sniper school candidates wash out on Day 1 because they can’t even pass the Army’s basic shooting qualifications due to lack of training and lack of competent shooting instructors.    Any savings need to go toward filling the enormous gaps in Readiness that currently exist.  Our military is a paper Tiger.,KevtheKnife,2025-04-27T13:07:02,2
"It was the Soviet Union... not specifically Russia. Russia may not be the greatest but they are no longer a Communist tyranny.  Also they kept losing in Afghanistan, I hear those mountains are treacherous.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T10:41:00,-26
Would sure hate to be in a decade long war in the Middle East. /s,DandierChip,2025-04-27T10:43:28,14
