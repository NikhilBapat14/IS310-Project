Jan 6 was the first test. The 2024 election was the second. We failed. Now we actually need to accept that the 2A is not just for fat rednecks South of the Mason Dixon.,williamgman,2025-05-09T10:18:05,13
He should be exhibit B at best. Andry Hernandez a gay makeup artist was also deported to that hellhole prison. An asylum seeker with a credible fear he is now serving what is essentially a life sentence in a super max hellhole because he fled persecution and had a crown tattoo with his parents names.  If dems were smart they’d ditch Garcia as the poster boy and switch to the skinny little stylist crying for his mother as they shave his head and slap him. He’s a much better case in what’s wrong,umassmza,2025-05-09T09:45:01,6

"But it would end the “oh but he’s a criminal” “he’s a wife beater” “judges said he’s a gang member”   Well here’s a stylist that fled here due to persecution over his sexual preference. Where is the danger here? All those arguments to Garcia don’t apply any more, so what’s the issue",umassmza,2025-05-09T11:15:24,2

There’s a reason the civil right movement focused on Rosa Parks and not Claudette Colvin.,umassmza,2025-05-09T11:50:49,3
"I can assure you it wasn’t because of her criminal record or perceived criminal record. Also…  Colvin was one of four plaintiffs in the first federal court case filed by civil rights attorney Fred Gray on February 1, 1956, as Browder v. Gayle, to challenge bus segregation in the city. In a United States district court, Colvin testified before the three-judge panel that heard the case. On June 13, 1956, the judges determined that the state and local laws requiring bus segregation in Alabama were unconstitutional.  So…. In the end— everyone. Not just one person. Everyone.",Mr_Horsejr,2025-05-09T11:57:58,2
