"What, does Trump literally think his mere presence in the oval office simply creates economic success?  He does realize that to deliver on that promise, he needed an economic plan, right?  I swear he doesn't have enough brains to blow his nose.",aaron_adams,2025-04-07T13:01:41,13

He‚Äôs been a lying fool since day one of his first term if not sooner than that lol. There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs a felon ü§£. Still cant get over that America voted in the felon because they didn‚Äôt want to vote in the educated woman of color. I‚Äôm so incredibly embarrassed to be living in this country.,babyybunnyy3,2025-04-07T13:26:37,11

"You know when he is lying to you ? He says or writes some.  This man- child is incapable of telling the truth.

"I don‚Äôt know what I was watching when I saw it, but a very important little factoid was brought up. Trump says the tariffs are all about bringing manufacturing back to the US, but he is leaving the door open to negotiate with these countries to lower the tariffs if companies are gonna consider doing all their manufacturing back in the US and put all the money into investing in that they‚Äôve gotta know that these tariffs are gonna stick Otherwise why would they proceed to gear up for manufacturing using parts all built in the US?  And if he does not break down and negotiate with these countries, then it will be years before these manufacturers can gear themselves up to compete with what parts they were purchasing overseas.",Chipfullyinserted,2025-04-07T14:10:13,2

Same. How can you think a fat toddler is going to turn America into an empire?  How can you think things are going to be THIS one-sided when things almost never are in reality?  How can you believe he will make America better overall when that didn't happen during his first term?  MAGA brains should be donated to scientists.,opturtlezerg5002,2025-04-07T12:05:13,22
