">The head of Harvard University doubled down on his defiance against the Trump administration Wednesday, saying the Ivy League school would not compromise on certain issues despite the federal government’s threat to freeze more than $2 billion in funding.  >In an exclusive interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, Harvard President Alan Garber said the school had “no choice” but to fight back against what it believes is federal overreach and an illegal attempt by the government to withhold funding as leverage to control academic decision-making.   >“We are defending what I believe is one of the most important lynchpins of the American economy and way of life — our universities,” Garber said.",mvanigan,2025-04-23T14:36:41,144

Trump is trying to change the way colleges receive accreditation by installing his own lackeys on the board that oversees it. Who wants to bet that he tries to find some way to retract accreditation for Harvard law school?  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reforming-accreditation-to-strengthen-higher-education/,Randomwhitelady2,2025-04-24T06:36:17,2

"Protesting is not antisemitism, Harvard is already capitulating to infringe free speech...   From the same article:  ""Garber acknowledged that the Massachusetts campus has a “real problem” with antisemitism amid a war between Israel and Hamas that began after the group attacked Israel in October 2023.  In its lawsuit, Harvard outlined steps it has taken to curb incidents of antisemitism, including imposing ""meaningful discipline"" for policy violators, beefing up security, enhancing programs meant to address bias and hiring staff to support those programs.""",PoetrySubstantial455,2025-04-24T01:45:51,10
