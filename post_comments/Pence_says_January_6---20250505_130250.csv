"Yes, thank goodness his coup failed and that was the last we saw of that Trump fellow. Pence’s conduct was laudable that day, but it was the way he stood up for what was right afterwards and ensured that Trump couldn’t run agai … hang on.",Minguseyes,2025-05-05T13:08:12,31
Imagine getting an award for courage for doing the bare fucking minimum required of your job.,OkayComputer1701,2025-05-05T13:12:27,10
Did he get a trophy for not breaking the constitution and just doing his job like every VP before him?,GenosseGeneral,2025-05-05T13:31:44,7

"Yea bullshit.  Pence only did what he had to do BECAUSE he couldn’t legally get away with it.  Not for lack of trying, between the election and certification he had his team run through every book looking for a way to turn over the election.  He even called Dan Quayle who is an expert in this type of political law.    Dan shot down every posit he had and finally told him in no uncertain terms he would cause a constitutional crisis if he did this, full stop.  Pence wasn’t a hero, he simply didn’t want to go to jail for fucking Trump who desperately tried to get him too.  Pence was a potted plant holder who was willing to kill this election and would have in a heartbeat if he didn’t get potentially arrested for it.    The result?  Him and his family (who were at the Capitol that day) nearly got hung by that fucking traitorous mob and *even then* that fucking jellyfish couldn’t even stand up and say Trump was fucking wrong.  Fuck Mike Pence and whoever wants to kiss his ass with this horseshit award.  You want to hand out awards?  Give it to Dan Quayle - he at least didn’t toe party lines and fuck us for goddamn Donald Trumps fucking ego.",Windowsoftheskull,2025-05-05T17:39:11,1

I mean I’m not a pence supporter but not sure what more he could have done to make sure he couldn’t run again. He wasn’t in any position of power after the administration ended.,nightpanda893,2025-05-05T13:12:18,8
Yet I’m still surprised and impressed that someone in the administration did the bare minimum. The bar is on the floor and all.,MelpomeneAndCalliope,2025-05-05T16:48:04,2

He could have certainly done more and used the weight of the office of the VP post J6,RocBane,2025-05-05T13:14:59,8
