"Y’all, can we stop this weird effort to rehabilitate the Bushes, Cheneys and Reagans of the world. There is a direct line from the 80s brand of neoconservatism to where we are right now.",FewWatermelonlesson0,2025-03-29T13:51:05,84
"He bent the knee to Trump like almost every other Republican.   He was the most boring Bush.  Whenever anybody questioned him about his disastrous policies or his brother's, he would just sigh and huff and complain about why people wanted to focus on the past because he considered it all to be ancient history.",Megalodon481,2025-03-29T13:32:35,31
"I blame Jeb for orchestrating the stolen election of 2000, which made it possible for Donald and company to disenfranchise over 4 million voters in 2024",pastoreyes,2025-03-29T13:52:18,28

Yep. I also find it odd how all of those who had to have weapons to fight a tyrannical government backs the tyrannical government when it shows up.,smokeybearman65,2025-03-29T13:04:19,16

Oh yeah funny because I haven’t heard boo from him or his brother. Don’t delude yourself by thinking people like him will help us out of this mess. Their silence is intentional. They fear to speak up because of retribution. That’s how our democracy will die.  Time to rise up America and take affirmative action!,No-Island5970,2025-03-29T15:16:35,1

"Can someone explain to me what really happened to the Republican Party? It seemed like old republicans hated Nazis and dictators. Now, they’re all Nazis pandering to a dictator. What led to this? Was it forming before Trump? Was it the hatred for Obama?",After-Knee-5500,2025-03-29T19:56:42,1

"I HIGHLY recommend yins watch the documentary on Netflix Get Me Roger Stone. It goes into how deep and far back this all goes. These past instances of Republicans being normal human beings are and were a broken clock scenario. They've always been batshit looney toons and put through the most ridiculous candidates. Their favorite, Reagan, was also a celebrity. He may not be as goofy as some of their candidates but he wasn't qualified either, he was just a good actor.",TeffySwan,2025-03-30T07:28:15,1

He defended Trump during his criminal trial and claimed the charges were political persecution.

Plenty of Republican politicians privately despise Trump but still bend the knee and toe the line.  They will never oppose or denounce him publicly.,Megalodon481,2025-03-29T23:26:07,7

"Jeb isn't Evangelical... but he's been around them long enough to know their language. Jeb's first sentence is sterile-template HR-speak, and ""I'm praying for you **for our country**"" is practically *dripping* raw contempt & disdain for Trump.  If Jeb has **ever** said an earnest & heartfelt prayer ""for"" Trump, it was probably Psalm 109:8-15 (Google it, I think even the Satanic Temple would gleefully approve).",PantherkittySoftware,2025-03-30T16:58:45,0

"For sure, but you could honestly point to Goldwater as the real genesis of what eventually even put Reagan in the White House to begin with. Goldwater tends to get brushed to the side a lot because he got trounced by LBJ as bad as he did, but there's a very clear connection between his kind of anti-government/libertarian message and Reaganism. Hell, his tendency for flippant commentary that seemed to not always appreciate the seriousness of the office is very proto-Trump to me.   Think it was Chris Wallace who said that he and the other young Republicans who came up in the Reagan years believed Goldwater had won, just 16 years late. ",SkyJW,2025-03-30T02:57:18,7
">Jeb isn't Evangelical  I know.  Jeb is Catholic, like Alito and Santorum and scores of other MAGA supporters.  Being evangelical is not required to be MAGA or MAGA-compliant.  Plenty of people bend the knee while sneering and gnashing their teeth in resentment.  Doesn't change the fact that they rolled over and surrendered.  Jeb has settled into his irrelevance and made it clear he will not openly challenge or oppose Trump anymore.  He will toe the MAGA line, like 99.9% of Republicans now.",Megalodon481,2025-03-30T17:07:12,1
"If, by some miracle of divine intervention, Josh & Gay win in Florida on Tuesday, Trump's Congressional coalition will **collapse** because House & Senate Republicans will finally become more worried about losing to a *Democrat* than losing to a Musk-financed primary opponent.  It **might** even happen if Josh & Gay lose by anything less than a landslide.  The fact that a Trump-annointed candidate (Randy Fine) is polling 4 points less than Josh Weil in a district that was R+30 for Trump is nothing short of **apocalyptic** for MAGA.  Once the dam starts to leak, you're going to see people like Jeb drop all pretense of polite non-opposition & go into full ""flamethrower mode"" against him.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-03-30T17:22:03,1
