">Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a 409 page [report](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/gender-dysphoria-report.pdf) called ""Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices."" Meant to be an evidence-based look at gender-affirming care for trans kids, the report reads less like a scientific review and more like a policy hit job against transgender youth.  >Let me be clear: this isn’t evidence-based medicine. It’s state-sponsored gaslighting.  >[Conversion therapy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/guide/so-called-conversion-therapy-and-the-lgbtq-youth-mental-health/) is a debunked and discredited practice that aims to change the sexuality and/or gender identity of LGBTQ+ individuals. According to The Trevor Project, conversion therapy is based on the incorrect idea that LGBTQ+ identities are disordered and need to be fixed. Currently, 23 states and Washington D.C. [ban the practice](https://www.lgbtmap.org/img/maps/citations-conversion-therapy.pdf), and another four states and Puerto Rico specifically ban it for minors. The practice has been [linked to](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/09/conversion-practices-lgbt.html) increased depression, PTSD, and suicidality in LGBTQ+ people.  >Conversion therapy has [tried to rebrand](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-changing-face-of-conversion-therapy) before, but given the stated intent in the report— to repackage gender dysphoria as “common during puberty and adolescence” and to encourage “adolescents come to terms with their bodies” — this seems like yet another attempt. The report explicitly denies this, as the authors seem aware that they’d come up against this criticism (the authors, by the way, have not been named).  >I’ve seen the impact of this practice myself. I know the harm this kind of “therapy” causes because I endured it. Mine was called “reparative therapy”—a clinical-sounding name for a process that sought to unmake me. I was told my queerness wasn’t inherent, but the result of emotional deficits — specifically, a lack of “healthy, non-sexual male bonding.” According to my professional counselor, I was trying to “consume” other men, a kind of “sexual cannibalism” meant to fill a missing masculine core. Week after week, I was dissected—my desires reframed as pathology, my identity treated as trauma. The damage wasn’t loud or immediate. It settled in slowly, teaching me to doubt intimacy, to fear tenderness, to see my own reflection as something to be fixed.",southpawFA,2025-05-10T12:04:08,1
"Research on the issue of family acceptance of LGBTQ youth conducted at San Francisco State University found that ""compared with LGBTQ young people who were not rejected or were only a little rejected by their parents and caregivers because of their LGBTQ+ identity, highly rejected LGBTQ young people were:  * *8 times more likely to commit suicide* * *Nearly 6 times more likely to experience depression* * *More than 3 times more likely to use illegal drugs* * *More than 3 times as likely to be high risk for HIV or AIDS.*    All major medical associations, from the AMA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association stand against conversion therapy.    ***According to The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 10% of LGBTQ youth reported undergoing conversion therapy, with 78% reporting it occurred when they were under age 18.***    Youth who reported undergoing conversion therapy reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not.    ***Furthermore, a peer-reviewed study published by The Trevor Project in the American Journal of Public Health found that LGBTQ youth who underwent conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide and more than 2.5 times as likely to report multiple suicide attempts in the past year.***    * *Rates of attempted suicide by LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation were more than double (48%) the rate of LGBT young adults who reported no conversion experiences (22%).* * *Suicide attempts nearly tripled for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation (63%).* * *High levels of depression more than doubled (33%) for LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation compared with those who reported no conversion experiences (16%) and more than tripled (52%) for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation.* * *Sexual orientation change experiences during adolescence by both parents/caregivers and externally by therapists and religious leaders were associated with lower young adult socioeconomic status, less educational attainment, and lower weekly income.*    Conversion therapy must be abolished!

"Makes no mistake, I fully expect a lot of conservative states starting to push hard to make transgender expression in public become a sex offense. I also fully expect same sex affection such as hand holding, kissing, and other things that are not scrutinized heavily for male and female couples to become a sex offense when done in public.   These folks know that death camps and concentration camps are not palatable to the American public, not when it comes to doing it to citizens who were born here and are white.   Everyone also knows that having a sex offense on your record is quite literally a death sentence. Your social life dies, your ability to economically prosper dies, pretty much any semblance of having a happy, normal life dies when this is on your record and you are on a registry.   They can eliminate the problem or push everyone back into the closet by force utilizing what I said above without spilling a drop of blood. Once the arrests start happening and the penalties are severe and people see how bad life gets for those people, a majority will toe the line and conform out of fear.   The sad part is, is that the moderates and apolitical types will not lift a finger to help these people or make a big stink about it. They will shrug their shoulders and claim that since they aren't transgender and that they aren't gay, it's not their problem and that they are fine.  The time to get a passport, get asylum, or find a sponsor in another country was years ago. Hard days are ahead for those who outwardly express their queer identity, and I feel for my fellow citizens who are going to suffer soon.",AllUsernamesInUse_,2025-05-10T15:43:17,1

Gender Dysphoria   Gosh then, [it's a good thing gender dysphoria and gender incongruence are not mental health disorders](https://www.mentalhealthjournal.org/articles/gender-incongruence-is-no-longer-a-mental-disorder.html).   > the number of youth identifying as gay and lesbian has remained  around 2% over the last 40ish years,   That's ***wildly untrue***. [LGBT+ identification ticked up over two percentage points in the last five years alone, with over 30% of Gen Z women self-idrntifying as bisexual](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx). Over 20% of Gen Z identified as LBGT+, with 10.5% of all millennials saying the same.

The *foundation* of gender-affirming care for minors is therapy, with no medical interventions permitted before puberty.

"Yes, the disorders which a person's dysphoria causes and exacerbate should be treated as well addressing the social and physical causes of the dysphoria itself.  That's how healthcare in general is supposed to work.  What we already know \*doesn't\* work is trying to treat all those things \*before\* you allow someone to address the dysphoria that is the root cause of so much of their other struggles.  It demotivates people from even \*trying\* to seek help, and leads to increased rates of self-harm and suicide.  Also, do we really still need to teach people the whole ""wow everyone's suddenly left-handed"" lesson?  Being openly gay and lesbian has been a lot less risky for a lot longer than being openly trans had become 5-10 years ago so of course more and younger people are finding the courage to speak up for themselves.  The fact that more people are feeling comfortable being seen and are managing to access the help they need to address their dysphoria is a \*good\* thing.  The fact that fewer of them are being relentlessly bullied back into the closet by their peers and parents is a \*good\* thing.",StarInTheMoon,2025-05-10T12:47:00,1

You cite gay and lesbian. But now many people identify as bisexual now? How many people say they are ace or pan? How many labels now have flexibility and fluidity to them after we started to make progress in society?   There are more trans people now because we have the language and knowledge to identify our feelings.

"You are never going to convince these people. They think that your transgender identity is an arbitrary choice, that at your core you don't truly believe you are what you say you are, or that you are mentally ill and need to be treated.   The sad thing is, if there was a therapy that was ethical, effective, and evidence-based that would actually allow someone to recognize their chromosomal birth gender and to be happy and accept it,  that would be great as an option for those who do not wish to go through a transition. Such a thing does not exist though, and it seems that at the current moment it will never exist. Conservatives can't accept this so they will do their best at forcing your conformity.   Make no mistake, I fully believe that they are going to push to make transgender identity in public become a sex offense, same sex affection becoming a sex offense, etc.   This particular brand of conservatives are a little bit smarter in that they aren't going to explicitly try and do the whole death camp thing because it isn't palatable to the American public. They can completely eliminate or push a lot of these things back into the closet with what I said above.   Everyone knows a sex offense is a literal death sentence to your social standing, your ability to achieve economic prosperity, and to have any kind of a quality life and  happiness. There have already been talks in certain states of this happening, and I fully expect it to be fully embraced soon enough by most conservatives.  The time to get a passport and get out was years ago.
