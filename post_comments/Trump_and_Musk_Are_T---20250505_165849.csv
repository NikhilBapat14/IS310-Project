They are attacking it internally. On the outside it will look the same but inside they are removing IT staff and appointing a payments guru as the commissioner.   It will be privatized to the point where a service is required to maintain the IT infrastructure and to process the payments. This will insure that someone (maybe Thiel’s and Musks baby-PayPal) will be there to take a little off the top of every transaction and cronies will be in place to keep the private data flowing to foreign actors long after the DOGE kids have begun to grow facial hair.,butter_brickles,2025-05-06T07:08:54,3

Remove the income cap and start cutting out people that never paid into it. i.e. spousal support needs to disappear over 20 to 30 years. You want it work 10 years to earn it. Simple.

"Oof. Congress has never taken money out of Social Security - this is a profound misunderstanding.  You’re correct that SS is self-financed through dedicated payroll taxes and trust fund assets, but you’re incorrect that this avoids budget or deficit impacts.  When SS runs a cash flow deficit (as it does, by some $200B this year), they have to redeem trust fund bonds and that actual cash has to be found somewhere (general revenue, cost-cutting, more borrowing).  In a more indirect sense, the cost of SS is relevant even if it weren’t running a cash flow deficit. If the total value of SS taxes weren’t required to pay for SS, they could be spent elsewhere.

For clarity the bonds aren't standard bonds either. They're special bonds separate from the bond market redeemable at any time.  They're akin to how it works when you deposit money in a bank.   And inflows less than outflows happens right now. They just redeem the bonds (withdraw from their bank account) to cover the difference.

"Well, those are actually two different proposals.   The proposal that would yield the greatest benefit is raising the cap on contributions while capping benefits at existing rates. If you raise benefits proportionally, you decrease solvency impact by about 5 years.  Also, I don’t think you know the ages of boomers. The young boomers are in their early 60s.

"Yes, they are social security taxes because that’s what it costs to run the program as-is (and don’t actually cover our current costs already).   My point is that if we were able to secure seniors for half the cost, we could still collect those taxes but use them elsewhere, on modern industrial policy, major infrastructure, any number of other productive areas.

"I definitely agree on raising the social security cap. I'm wary of means testing because it will inevitably mean seniors who need benefits get locked out. It also means people who've paid into the system for decades will get less than they are owed simply because they were responsibily investing for decades. Social security after all was never meant to cover all retirement costs. So for means testing it would have to effect the very rich who won't even notice a social security check.   Not familiar with the other models so can't comment. Either way, it seems like Republicans can only propose things that negatively impact a majority of Americans on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder like raising the retirement age.

"Agree with you that the cut to payout is a huge deal. I just take issue with describing it as insolvent. Words matter and using insolvent and insolvency leads to the idea that if nothing is done the program will stop paying entirely. This primes a section of payees to be receptive to the notion that they have no dog in the fight since the idea becomes 'well I'll never be able to receive it'.

"Nobody has “paid in” to the system or is “owed” anything. Current taxpayers are paying benefits to current enrollees - there is a common misconception that people are just drawing down what they paid in.   It’s a fallacy - the taxes retirees paid have already been spent.   When we think about the economic environment for younger people today and the fact that increasing amounts of incomes will need to be dedicated to paying social security checks to a generation holding a huge share of expensive real estate, many with pensions, many with 401ks and IRAs in the millions of dollars, it opens up a massive window for a reconsideration of the SS “contract”.  Now, I wouldn’t personally support any proposal that removed Social Security from anyone currently receiving it right away. Even for means-testing, I’d recommend tapering off benefits over time. And for those who clearly need Social Security - if you’re above, at, or near retirement age, you shouldn’t have to worry about the system being changed on you all of a sudden.   But we have to start thinking about the future because this is a future-oriented program. If we’re eventually going to rely on market solutions, the time to start those investments is now.

"I’m not in opposition to raising the cap, but it isn’t a permanent solution.   Over the next decade or so, the number of enrollees is only going to rise, before plateauing for another several decades.   At the same time, the base of tax-payers is going to shrink. We reach a critical ratio of taxpayers to enrollees by 2035, with no obvious solution other than to reform social security or import in significantly more workers.   Even if we can create a solvent program, we’re still talking about a program with a $1.5T price tag. That represents taxes being taken out of our economy.
