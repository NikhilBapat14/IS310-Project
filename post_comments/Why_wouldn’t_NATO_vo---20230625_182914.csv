"There is no provision to remove a country from NATO, unless you count everyone else quitting NATO and forming a new alliance. Even if there was, Turkey plays spoiler a lot but also has a pretty important strategic role. They are one of the most militarily credible members of the alliance, they control entrance and exit to the Black Sea, and they serve as a buffer between most of the alliance and the Middle East.  You say they openly sided with Russia, but they have been supplying lots of weapons to Ukraine (e.g. TB-2 drones) and have blocked Russia from reinforcing the Black Sea Fleet. It also is useful to have *someone* who can talk to Russia, and Turkey has mediated various agreements between Russia and Ukraine (like an agreement to allow grain exports via the Black Sea).",cpast,2023-06-30T07:54:58,1
Because there is nothing in the NATO rules that allow people to vote a country out.  They also don't want to lose Turkey because they need the strategic location.,Hapsbum,2023-06-30T09:44:36,1
