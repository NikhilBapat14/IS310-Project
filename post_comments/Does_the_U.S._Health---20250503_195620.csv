"The US system poses the most challenges because it is grossly overpriced and therefore unsustainable.  Uwe Reinhardt addressed this in ""It's the Prices, Stupid.""  The US has the highest per capita healthcare costs in the world because Americans pay more for healthcare providers and services.    It's really simply a matter of paying Ferrari prices for Toyotas.  Americans don't consume any more healthcare than anyone else, they just get charged more for the same stuff.    The US has supply constraints combined with a failure to create mechanisms for bulk pricing.  We need more supply and price setters who will pay less for it.    This does not necessarily require single-payer.

"The current government run systems in the US don’t bear that statement out.     The VA spends something like 30% more per patient than the national average, and the reason that Medicare/caid appear cheaper is because the reimbursements in most cases don’t even cover the cost of providing care which is huge part of why so many providers do not accept them.      > What people won't pay out of their checks? What hundreds of federal and state programs won't be needed anymore?    You’re making the very frequent mistake of assuming that none of that money would go to healthcare when that’s not how it would work—the money would still come out of someone’s check (only now in the form of taxes) and those federal and state programs would simply become subordinate parts of whatever national system existed.

If the US healthcare system was really good I wouldn't have had mentally ill people all around my work or in the playgrounds my kids wanted to play in back in the US.  Until access to affordable quality healthcare, including mental healthcare and prescription medication, is universal to all residents, talking about reform is a waste of time.  Have you been in the emergency room lately?  My Dad waited almost 12 hours for an emergency surgery.  I almost lost my mind that they'd left him sitting in the waiting room all night.  Another thing to note is that those wait lists in other countries are often just culturally opposite to what we expect in the US and we might want to change.  For example if a 20 year old needs a hearing aid it will be almost immediate.  A 70 year old will have to wait for an appointment after all those young working and studying age adults get in there.  I'm ok with that.  I'm also ok with not paying a radiologist $500,000 a year so that there are tons of them available for immediate access to bill my insurance 10x the rate of other countries.

They do it, but they don't have to and more often than not shouldn't.  > And to pick a clear and undisputable example: people cannot make purely informed, rational decisions when they are not conscious.  Okay, great.  Can they make them before they go unconscious?  Are all health care choices made under this type of duress, or are we capable of treating emergency situations differently than the bulk of health care transactions?  > More broadly, people are not capable of entirely divorcing themselves from the fear of death, meaning they are more likely to make irrational decisions.  If I don't eat, I also die.  Somehow, we manage.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-05-05T15:29:36,1
"This is just the same old tired libertarian lore you've trotted out without fail for years now. We know how an unregulated market works, because the *reason* we have laws against monopolies is that they formed when companies were left to their own devices. It doesn't really matter how good your widget is if Uncle Pennybags has one hundred billion dollars more than you do and can sell his shitty widgets at a loss for years longer than you can afford to stay in business. There is nothing about capitalism in and of itself that guarantees competition. Even *Adam Smith* knew that. The Invisible Hand isn't invisible because it works with ineffable force, it's invisible because it doesn't exist.  Setting aside the fact that people starving to death is a major reason why society turned it's back on unfettered markets *hundreds* of years ago, food is something you can at least in theory grow yourself. You are incapable of treating your own cancer at home. The majority of people do not have the required knowledge to make the sort of perfectly informed decisions theoretical economics require. The sort of pure free market economies Libertarians yern for are based on simplified models that do not reflect the reality of the world we live in.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-05T15:44:36,2
