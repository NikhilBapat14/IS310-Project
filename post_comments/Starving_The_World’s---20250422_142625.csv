This is what the republican party truly is. It's a gang of criminals scamming their own voters for the purpose of hurting people who did nothing wrong. If you think for a single second that they're going to grow and spine and stop it you're misunderstanding what that party fundamentally is: A gang of criminals... They're never going to stop hurting people... That's the entire purpose to it... It's like a competition to see who can rip the most people off and get away with it.,Actual__Wizard,2025-04-22T15:32:45,50

We need a real accounting of the rot in our government and how it is reflective of something very fucked and sociopathic with society, on both sides and all fronts.

"You‚Äôre talking about replacing a decades-established foreign embedded global aid organization with ten thousand people directly employed and countless more whose entire livelihood depended on its existence. ‚ÄúStepping up‚Äù isn something that happens overnight. USAID took decades to build, untold amounts of hardship endured in some of the most ravished parts of the planet to save lives and lift up humanity.  Do you know what these people did? They weren‚Äôt just handing out food. They saved millions from malaria, tuberculosis‚Ä¶ HIV/AIDS‚Ä¶  The aids one is particularly rough. There‚Äôs a cheap medicine that you can give to a pregnant mother who has HIV, that will vastly cut the odds their child will be born with HIV. The existence of this medicine and USAID‚Äôs involvement in bringing it to the most impacted regions vastly reduced childhood HIV across the continent.  Those meds aren‚Äôt going to be administered. Hundreds of babies are being born with HIV every single day, that would have been born healthy had Trump not stroked that pen. The impact of just that tiny little aspect of this will be absolutely horrific.  It would take decades to rebuild what was lost. There is no ‚Äúinterim‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt result in an absolutely obscene amount of human suffering and death all from the stroke of a pen. When we look back, years from now, I won‚Äôt be surprised if the dead number in the millions. If you really want to know, do a little google-fu or ask every LLM in existence about how many lives USAID saved per year, and extrapolate how many lives they actively won‚Äôt.  One of the single most heinous acts ever committed on humanity as a whole. It‚Äôs an act of evil, frankly. There‚Äôs no other way to swing it.  But the world won‚Äôt save those people either. They‚Äôll be allowed to die.  If you haven‚Äôt been watching what‚Äôs going on around the planet, most of the developed world has actually steeply cut their foreign aid so they can refocus that money on building bullets (Europe is actively arming itself).",teachersecret,2025-04-23T03:28:57,5

Not the case.  I will give what I have to whoever needs it.  But there is a basic fact of nature here that we are trying to sidestep.  When you keep having babies but your environment cannot support your food intake then it‚Äôs time to start working on some education about birth control - and that could be in tandem with food donations - until they get their numbers where they‚Äôre comfortable,Robot_Alchemist,2025-04-23T11:42:25,0
