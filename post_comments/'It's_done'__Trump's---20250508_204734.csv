"The key word in your first sentence is ""mess"". It's hard to successfully take over a country if you and everyone around is an incompetent dope. Especially a country where the election is as decentralized as it is in the United States.  Just within the last week:   * Trump has had to pull two nominees because Republican lawmakers who are seen as vulnerable in the midterms have told him they're not voting for them. One of those lawmakers (Thom Tillis) Trump was able to bully into supporting Hegseth back in January. * Trump's ""big beautiful"" spending bill is causing House Republicans to fight among themselves because (once again) Republicans who are in swing districts don't want to cut programs like Medicaid and lose their seats in 2026. This has led Trump to give the (unthinkable) order, ""Raise taxes on the wealthy,"" Which Mike Johnson and co. have collectively responded to with, ""Lol. No."" * Per this article, his own ambassador is walking back and downplaying a claim that, until today, every member of his administration when asked (included the ""sane"" ones like Rubio) have doubled down on. * He even (seemingly reluctantly) walked back the 2028 talk. Basically begrudgingly acknowledging within in the last week, the fact that he ""doesn't think"" he can run in 2028.  That doesn't sound like someone who can successfully launch a coup. We've seen him try to do a coup firsthand, if you step back from the emotion you feel that it happened in the first place and look at it objectively, it was a pretty shit attempt at a coup and he caved within hours.  And yes, I know you (or someone) will probably pull out the, ""The Nazis weren't competent,"" But they were compared to the Trump Administration.

"I think you're not following the American resistance as closely as you think. Because idk what the Tesla protests are if not something that hurt billionaire pockets.    Protests can't do everything. Imo civil disobedience is where it's at, but your statement is still short sighted.",DancingWithAWhiteHat,2025-05-09T02:20:05,4
"They sold us out and would rather fold than come back here thats fine by me. This is the bad choices of the past catching up to them and long past due imo. I am fed up with American in name only BS. I get that those north and south of the border hate this, i would too in thier shoes. That anger though is what Americans have felt for decades now. Sure the stock portfolio's have gone up, very little of that money makes or stays on main street though.   This isnt the way that i would wanted things to be done as its too chaotic but the system that was in place had no incentive to change.",ceiffhikare,2025-05-09T08:50:24,1
"Except it is not so captain obvious with the leaked plans for Greenland and Panama.   Just call it what it is. The American people and media are complicit with, or at best unaware of, the admins imperialistic domination of your neighbors.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-05-09T01:48:25,-1
"Since the day I was born in ‘86, the United States of Fascism has only continued to barrel further and further to the political right, while continuing to wage bs wars and stripping its citizens of the most basic rights.   I’ll change my opinion when I see ANY lasting difference happen in America. Not holding my breath.",shadowgathering,2025-05-09T02:24:52,1
I am Canadian not American. I don’t care at all if they go bankrupt they make shit vehicles anyway imo. Trumps tariffs are not going to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs back to America. They may bring manufacturing back but new plants will mostly be automated. No American is going to work for Chinese wages.,Magicman_,2025-05-09T10:47:02,2
">Except it is not so captain obvious with the leaked plans for Greenland and Panama.   You're not going to find a defender of our media here. The point is that people have protested this specifically. I think some of the border cities even held their own rallies to protest Trumps threats specifically.   >The American people and media are complicit with, or at best unaware of, the admins imperialistic domination of your neighbors.   Surprisingly I disagree, when it comes to the American people. There isn't a significant contingent of the population salivating at the month to take over Canada. His rhetoric has caused distress at worst and frustration at best amongst most Americans. Even in MAGA spaces, this is a topic of conflict. It's less popular than deporting all the brown Americans they hate, and they'd prefer he focused on that.    The media being complicit is nothing new. I stand by what I said though. They don't think it's news worthy. Greenland? Sometimes. But Canada? I think they assume it's a given that Americans are against it. ",DancingWithAWhiteHat,2025-05-09T01:59:31,4
