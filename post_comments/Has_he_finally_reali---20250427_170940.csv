The next time he talks to Putin he‚Äôll think Zelensky is evil again.  He falls for propaganda as easily as my senile grandma.,aznrandom,2025-04-27T17:16:23,61
Trump isn't saying anything about Putin without getting permission from Putin first.,Vast_Breadfruit_162,2025-04-27T17:14:32,14
I doubt he's smart enough to realise putin is playing him like a fiddle.   Maybe trump is just Swaffelen.,netsheriff,2025-04-27T17:12:28,10
"A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. He probably finally understands that he's the beta in the relationship, but also isn't going to do anything to make his hero/crush mad at him and definitely isn't going to admit it to his Fox News cult.   I bet the moron genuinally thought he could waltz into the White House, say ""Hey, Zelensky, recognize the territory that Russia has invaded as their own now"", have him happily agree to that, feel like that would make Putin happy enough, and then walk away with a Noble Prize; something he desperately wants because Obama got one.   Unfortunately for the orange moron, he failed to realize that ol' Putin doesn't just want Ukraine, but to claim any territory that was once under the Russian Empire, and probably even more than that.",SodaCanBob,2025-04-27T17:20:57,10
Here‚Äôs a better question. Is Trump capable of introspection?,u2shnn,2025-04-27T17:22:31,6

No he has not realized Putin is playing him.   As a stable genius and artful deal maker he is incapable of being ‚Äúplayed‚Äù.   That will never happen.  Everyone says so.,NoFreePi,2025-04-27T17:26:31,3
"Trump was raised by his father to see the world as being comprised of winners and losers, and to never be a loser.  Trump has also been a Russophile for decades and thinks of Putin as his friend.  So he is heavily invested emotionally in favoring Russia, as he sees Putin as a great success and wishes to be like him.  There are only two things that are going to change Trump's mind about Ukraine and Putin:  \- He comes to believe that Putin is a loser  \- He starts to think that Putin is not his friend  There is a slight chance that Trump had a sort of epiphany by having his ego bruised.  Zelensky was applauded at the Pope's funeral, while he was not, which makes him feel inadequate.  Meanwhile, Russian state media is openly mocking Trump for being a dupe.  Trump has a track record of dumping his friends.  That's especially true if he comes to see them as losers.",I405CA,2025-04-27T18:47:34,3
Blowing in the wind. It‚Äôs all for show.   Russia has far too much on Trump for him to push back too much.,tcoh1s,2025-04-27T20:49:14,3

"I suspect a ‚ÄúTrump-Putin scheme‚Äù is going on.  Trump is a Russian asset no doubt. He‚Äôs playing the game for appearance, not effectiveness. He wants Ukraine to fail.",thomport,2025-04-27T21:10:27,2

Trump is un-American. Who knows what a guy like that wants went he don‚Äôt care about country at all.  Trump would be just as happy to live in Russia at his new Trump Tower being treated so specially.,yorapissa,2025-04-27T22:04:06,2
"I mean, it be nice if he did. I feel like its honestly too easy to assume its part of a larger plan considering whatever it was to achieved has not come to fruition at all.

"It has long looked highly likely that Putin ""has something"" on Trump.  And if Zelensky also has something on Trump that private meeting would have been the perfect place to clobber him with it.  Trump has several walk-in closets overflowing with awful, compromising intel on him, and plenty of it comes from Zelensky's part of the world.  Maybe Trump agreed to that one-on-one meeting because Zelensky frightened him.",Winter-Gift1112,2025-04-27T18:22:37,1

I would say it depends on how much sunshine Putin can blow up his ass before trump's opinion hardens against him...because if there is one thing donny is susceptible too is having warm glowies blown up his ass from people he sees as better than him.,dispelhope,2025-04-27T18:08:39,0

"That's the thing, too, right? A deal that is *this* one-sided is just a non-starter to begin with.

You essentially guarantee further Russian aggression in a few years at the latest with this deal.",SilverhawkPX45,2025-04-27T20:01:10,3
