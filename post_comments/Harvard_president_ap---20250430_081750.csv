"Harvard could lead the way by having high quality student debates on the topics protested. Instead we see astroturfed protests aimed at emotional agitation and the byproduct of those protests is violent antisemitism on campus. There is a choice here, understanding and solutions (debate) or hate and violence (astroturfed protests). This is what is so disappointing. Harvard leading the race to the bottom when they could do so much more.",Lepew1,2025-04-30T18:31:05,1

"I live here, and while yes, there are some passionate Harvard students who truly believe in the cause, people are coming in from other places to participate in these ""protests"" and it's a huge safety issue on top of these protests not representing reality.",ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-01T21:12:24,2
