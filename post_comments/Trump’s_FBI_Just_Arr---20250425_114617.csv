"The only path left that leads to the happy ending where this is stopped is to impeach Trump now.   We can’t wait until the midterms; he is counting on that, he is not worried about midterms or his poll numbers, he doubtlessly has his people scheming up ideas on how to subvert them and he’s confident that they will work.   So we have to impeach him before midterms, before this year is even out. And we have to succeed in actually convicting him in the senate and getting him out of office.  How can we do that when republicans have majorities in both houses? There’s only one answer - we have to convince republicans to join us.   I know it’s a huge lift, but it’s our only shot. They have their redlines too, and there’s some residual respect for the founders and the constitution. It’s all of our jobs to try and make inroads with republicans and with moderates. Oh and we have to do it fast because the clock is ticking. We also need to pressure Republican congressmen (don’t threaten them, appeal to their good side). There are a lot less house members we need to flip than senate members and the senate tends to be more moderate, so we have that in our favor at least.   So this is the only path we have to stop this, we all have to do our part in making it happen.",airbear13,2025-04-25T12:30:48,36

Breaking point for the general public always happens too late. Way to many people live in denial,Akimbo_Zap_Guns,2025-04-25T12:37:44,138
"""Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It’s not so bad' or 'You’re seeing things' or 'You’re an alarmist.'  And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.""  -Milton Sanford Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45*",pleasedothenerdful,2025-04-25T15:15:25,37

"> I want to defend the 60+ percent of you that knows this is wrong but first you’ve got to stand up for yourselves.

With the advent of recorded and surveilled everything, the youth have the fear of losing their entire future.  With the erosion of labor rights and protections, more people fear job sanctions for participating or are simply completely unable to participate due to economics, etc.  We've made that dangerous amount of not-yet-solidified-progress where more people than ever fear they have something to lose (however small) because of past success in advancing rights and liberties, which does not bode well for civil disobedience and protest.

It's actually really common for immigration enforcement to shy away from courthouses to 1) not disrupt official proceedings and 2) not discourage undocumented immigrants from supporting the rule of law and potentially even helping law enforcement (sometimes as state witnesses).
