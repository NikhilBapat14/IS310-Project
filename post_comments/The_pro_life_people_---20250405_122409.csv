"If god didn’t give enough of a damn to forbid abortion, then why would I, in gods name, throw women and doctors in prison for getting abortions?  It’s borderline blasphemous to cite Christian faith as a reason to be pro-life.",Pearberr,2025-04-05T13:57:16,14
"Argument fails cause it displeases God so according to that logic it's a sin, crime and must be protected. So it's their duty. I have two Evangelical aunts. They make Catholics look like hippies.",catsoncrack420,2025-04-05T12:48:46,24
"They just use religion as a tool because it's the only culture white Americans really have, just like being Republican is the only cultural gathering they have as well. It's also obviously a tool to make them feel better about themselves, gossip after service, and gang up on the cracker barrel waitress, without leaving a tip of course.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-05T13:42:58,10
It's also hilarious to see Christians ask for prayers while they're going through fertility treatments.  Doesn't God want you to not be able to have kids naturally?,Banned_Opinions,2025-04-05T13:58:57,9

"What gets me is how the Bible says basically nothing about abortion, trans, the importance of right to arm yourself, etc - and SO MUCH about loving thy neighbor, taking care of the poor, not lying, and so forth.   But which do the evangelicals preach?   Not the Bible.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-05T15:13:22,8

"Tbf humans do use free will for evil.   I think if anything, we should point out that conservatives treat their kids like property in terms of sex education, regions beliefs, LGBT+, etc, and those kids are already born. Why would we grant a zygote/fetus rights over an adult that is then negated as soon as it is born?",CZall23,2025-04-05T14:06:07,4

The Bible is actually the most diabolical book full of sins; the hypocrisy is absolutely wild to me,down_therabbit_h0le,2025-04-06T18:40:18,3
Some of them are. I'm technically pro-life but that's a commonly misunderstood term and mistakenly used by the psychotic anti-arbortion folks who couldn't give a shit about anyone else or anything else.,adeo888,2025-04-05T18:48:24,2

"God is not pro choice by any means. There are numerous times God contradicts free will. Aside from that, the Bible does have instructions for abortions, but they're not for women to choose. Biblical abortions are for women who cheated on their husbands (or were raped). If the fetus survives, it was the husband's baby and all is well. If the fetus dies, it was the other man's. God is pro abortion in some cases and ""every sperm is sacred"" in other cases (see Onan). There are no times in the Bible in which a woman is free to choose to carry a child or abort",policri249,2025-04-06T00:04:50,1

"When I say Pro-choice, I'm not saying I'm pro-abortion. I hate the idea of abortion in my personal opinion, but that's the choice of a woman. The choice whether to do it or not. Not the choice of 70 year-old Republicans, not the choice of the government, not the choice of the Supreme Court. No one's forcing anyone to get an abortion. It's literally called pro-""choice"" for a reason. ",Former_Exam_103,2025-04-07T10:17:18,1

Look i’m all for taking the steam out of the Abrahamic religions but at least know what the fuck you’re talking about before making dumb shit memes like this.  The Christian/Hebrew/Muslim god is a cruel and maniacle character for many many many many reasons. He isn’t pro choice.
