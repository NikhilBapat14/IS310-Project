From my observations over the last 2 decades it's been republicans who completely crash the economy followed by voters deciding to put democrats back in office who then spend 2 terms fixing the economy followed by republicans getting back in and once again destroying the economy. Rinse and repeat.   Frankly I think most people are always going to be unhappy with the world regardless of which party gets in. We live in a time where the middle class is getting squeezed out and the youth today see home ownership as an impossibility while prices continue to soar higher. Meanwhile the rich just get richer. It just seems you can only pick the lesser of the evils these days and that choice will never be the extreme right for me.,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-10T10:24:11,1

"Truthfully I don’t understand most Americans and why they’re so susceptible to right wing propaganda. Republicans are not good for the economy and they never have been. 10 out of the past 11 recessions (with another one on the way) have happened under Republican administrations.  Runaway inflation and the beginning of the gap between the rich and the poor started in the 80s and caused by Reganomics. Clinton takes over in the 90s and the Democrats sweep up the mess the best they can. We had a balanced budged and the economy was chugging along.  Bush is elected in 2000 and thanks to Republican deregulation they crash the economy in 2007-2008 with the financial crisis. Don’t forget two Bush started two wars we couldn’t afford and couldn’t win. Obama and the Democrats yet again step in to sweep up the Republican mess.   Obama hands Trump a great economy. He wrecks it with massive tax cuts for the rich, ballooning national debt, and albeit covid helped him ruin the economy, he was already working on it. Then Biden takes over and we have the best economic recovery post covid in the entire world. Trump inherits this and immediately implements tariffs and slashes vital government spending. Experts are already saying there is a 60% chance of a recession.   At this point Americans trusting Republicans with the economy is willful ignorance.",Naive-Deer2116,2025-05-10T13:05:28,1

"(Article)  ---  *The writer is chief executive of the Messina Group and former campaign manager for President Barack Obama*  Donald Trump’s global trade war and his administration’s determination to radically remake the federal government have caused instability and hit American businesses and workers hard. Yet many of the same people now angry about his actions enthusiastically supported him in last November’s presidential election, largely because the Democrats did not present a credible economic alternative.  Voters trusted Trump on the economy more than Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, according to exit polls. That’s why we lost. If Democrats want to regain the presidency, the House of Representatives and the Senate, we need to be trusted on the economy again.  Some in Democratic circles have been asking whether an “abundance” agenda could unlock working-class voters again. Unfortunately, debates like these are not how you win elections. You win by communicating your broad values to voters clearly and succinctly. Trump has always done this well, and voters know where he stands. Democrats need to provide the same clarity.  We have a perfect opportunity to draw clear contrasts with the Republicans on economic priorities, especially as the Trump administration pushes its latest round of tax cuts that would disproportionately hurt the working class while adding billions to the national deficit. Democrats should focus on four economic values and put them at the heart of our campaigning.  The first is to make the economy our top priority. There is one refrain we hear repeatedly in focus groups — from young people and the elderly, men and women, white, Black and Latino voters, blue-collar and white-collar workers alike: “We know Trump is a [insert criticism], but he cares about my pocketbook.”  Voters give Trump the benefit of the doubt because they think he is focused on their economic wellbeing. By contrast, they have no idea what Democrats want for the economy — they just think we are “weak and woke”, prioritising cultural issues not economic ones.  The second value is celebrating wealth as the American dream. At its core, this is to own a home and take care of your family. To be rich, even. Yet many Democrats (some of whom are rich) are afraid to say that and instead demonise the idea of getting wealthy.  Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who won in a swing state carried by Trump, recently said one of the keys to his success was talking to young men about getting rich. “These guys don’t want . . . ‘economic stability’, They want to really live the American dream.”  Americans want to succeed and pass wealth down to their kids. And economic success need not be zero-sum — one person’s success does not necessitate another’s hardship. That is an economic value all Democrats should embrace. Third, Democrats should be pro-business. Though many on the far left of our party will reflexively reject this, it is not about longing to return to the days of unregulated excess but acknowledging that businesses of all sizes are the lifeblood of our economy.  Democrats must stand for making America a great place to run a business, with modern infrastructure, a skilled and educated workforce, sensible regulation and fiscal predictability. In return, we expect businesses to provide fair pay, maintain ethical practices and embrace corporate responsibility. Business is not the enemy, and people must see we believe that.  Fourth and finally, Democrats should be the party of economic innovation. When Democrats have found themselves in the political wilderness, the path back to relevance has always been through embracing the future. We did this and won as “Atari Democrats” in the 1980s and as Bill Clinton’s “New Dems” in the 1990s, and again in 2008 with Barack Obama.  We have been so focused on the dangers of the future that we’ve become an enemy of it. The world is rapidly evolving and Americans know it. They know that many jobs that existed 30 years ago won’t exist 30 years from now. Democrats must be leaders on education and training, empowering the next generation to succeed in new sectors, even without a college degree. This will drive home a simple message: we understand that the future is uncertain, but Democrats will cultivate economic innovation to ensure that it benefits everyone.  There is a lot of ground for Democrats to make up before the next presidential election on November 7, 2028. But relentlessly communicating these core economic values to voters is a good place to start.",1-randomonium,2025-05-10T10:08:08,-4

"Isn't the answer that these people make their choice entirely based on emotion, and then find reasons to justify that choice?  They feel certain things about certain people and vote for a fascist whom they think feels the same. Then they find and repeat a narrative where they made their choice based on ""the economy"" so that they can keep seeing themselves as good people despite the fateful choice they just made.  They see a candidate promising them a tax break but he is also a raging lunatic and an obvious fascist. Now they really want that little bit more money in their pocket, and they don't care about the consequences to anyone else, but they do care about not acknowledging all of that. So they believe he""ll be good for ""the economy"" and can continue thinking of themselves as rational and moral people.  They vote out of habit, because they don't really care and just want to be entertained. But that sounds bad and stupid, so they listen to the TV telling them it's ""good for the economy"" and hitch their wagon to that. The choice was already made, and for the most vacuous reason, but that is now safely covered by another.  And so on. It's bad faith. They don't believe he's good for the economy and then vote for him because of that. They vote for him and then have to play a role, where they believe he's good for the economy, so that they don't have to acknowledge the consequences of their own choices and don't have to confront the moral responsibility that comes with it. Worst case scenario, he ""betrays"" their trust and they are outraged at this! Until the next time they really want to make a choice that is obviously immoral. They'll instantly believe the narrative again, because it is not based on any reality but rather on what they personally need to be true at any given time.",barryvm,2025-05-10T11:30:58,1

Possibly another factor that may need to be considered is that some people like to vote for a TV celebrity who also seems to be a bit of a colorful character, rather than all those boring but sensible full-time politicians.

I suspect something like that happened with Reagan who was - in my view, one of the worst ever presidents - but he had a seemingly charming manner and, of course, he was a well known celebrity.
