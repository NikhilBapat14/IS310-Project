"*From Bloomberg News Reporter  Natalia Drozdiak:*  The Central Intelligence Agency released two videos Thursday aimed at recruiting Chinese officials who might be disillusioned by their prospects in government in a bid to get them to share top secrets about China with the US.

The US also hopes to prevent Chinese military aggression against Taiwan.

"The American government has turned on every person who trusted them. The Vietnamese who worked for Americans were abandoned, the Afghan interpreters were left behind, Russian spies were outed and disappeared and the Ukrainians undertook a war effort that just saw them forced into a mineral deal. There is no chance a Chinese official will fall for this.",Motorbarge,2025-05-01T23:37:27,1
