"Yes, if the Supreme Courts have balls. They would protect her and trigger a constitutional crisis. üòÇ The jury now is tainted, and they need to find new juniors who I forget the executive branch is now the judicial branch.    Sitting judges rarely face criminal charges in the United States. Accusations of misbehavior are typically investigated by state oversight agencies, and 9 out of 10 are allowed to keep their jobs, according to a Reuters review of more than 1,500 such cases.  Yes, because they are in the judicial process. It is like Trump brings the court martial to the Supreme Courts during the hearings.",kupomu27,2025-04-25T13:16:05,8

"She was arrested because she directed an undocumented immigrant who was in her courtroom out a side door. That would be problematic, though not necessarily arrest-worthy, if ICE had had a judicial warrant for this person's arrest, but it sounds like they did not. If they had an administrative warrant, which it sounds like they did, she did nothing wrong.  My read is that the FBI used a flimsy excuse to intimidate immigration judges.  The judge that gets her case will immediately toss it, and put the FBI's tit in a ringer.  Patel will end up testifying to Congress and arrogance will do him no good.",rapidcreek409,2025-04-25T13:52:01,10
