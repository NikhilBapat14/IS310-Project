"Copying here: I love how Trump could have probably rode into the white house 2.0 and acted just as the typical, standard Republican. No pointless across the board tariffs creating turmoil, no drastic cuts things like Veteran's Care, NIH science funding, FEMA and USDA farmer aid which even GOP voters are complaining about, no wrongful deportations/deporting US citizens, just following due process to carry out the law, no chaos in markets and shattering consumer confidence, price hikes looming etc.  And then instead, he could just do more tax cuts (slanted towards the wealthy), more spending on the military, and he could have said something like ""We're going to build up the manufacturing in these three critical areas..."" The economy would have hummed along at like +2.5%+3%, continued record employment, profits, stocks, etc. And despite structural issues with our economy (e.g. inequality, costs of housing, healthcare, education etc), he could have just sat back and declared it the best economy ever...a lie, but he'd probably be at 51-53% approval, which is decent in modern times, and he could have rode off into the sunset, and probably continued Republican majorities for a decade or maybe longer.  But no, he and his cabal cult are insane and are proving they're insane everyday, and crashing his approval near 40%, and now there's likely going to be a backlash empowering Democrats for the next 2-6 years, that is, if we have elections.",jarena009,2025-04-27T08:49:55,18

"When working on any big project you pick and choose what you work on in a specific order to best achieve your desired result.  This administration is trying to do 50 things at once with no real focus or planning.Doge should have spent months at each agency, Trump should have focused on one item like tariffs and not immigration, Canada, Panama, DEI, Russia, f47s, golden dome, golden passport, etc.  Spending a few hours coming up with a bullshit list of countries and percentages, some uninhabited, and going right into press conference mode was unbelievably stupid.  Having a press conference with Zelenskyy right away and discussing plans and policy in front of cameras was unbelievably stupid.  Itâ€™s just rushed stupidity",umassmza,2025-04-27T19:11:19,2

"We need to stop sanewashing the actions of Trump and Musk. They're not ""cutting costs"". They're intentionally destroying the institutions that keep our country functioning. They're not ""standing up to our enemy allies"". They're intentionally destroying the US economy. They're not ""protecting us from gangs"". They're destroying the rule of law and using the full power of the state for performative sadism and racist violence.   We all have valid criticisms of the US. Some quite egregious. But we will miss it when it's gone.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-27T09:31:37,5

Moreso this is how I think moderates and independents view the Trump presidency or would view it. They're low information and would probably be okay if we just didn't have all this turmoil and insanity from the Trump admin.,jarena009,2025-04-27T09:02:25,3
