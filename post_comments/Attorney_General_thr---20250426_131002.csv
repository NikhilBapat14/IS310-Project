So, the Christian nationalists are going to imprison doctors for providing necessary, life-saving care for trans people, who just want to live and be happy.      The next move will be to imprison every trans person and anyone who doesn't ""conform to Biblical gender roles"". That's what's pending.     This is genocide in every way. The Republicans are waging a pogrom on trans people, echoing 1933 Germany. This is sick and disgusting.

"I knew a lovely 17 y/o girl who had not yet achieved menarche despite being sexually developed (boobs, body hair in the right places, etc.) so her mother took her to the gynecologist who diagnosed her as biologically male due to extreme androgen insensitivity.  Yep.  Secondary sex characteristics of the male did not develop, but this girl had testicles in her abdomen and no uterus or vagina and no penis.  She thought of herself as female and wished to BE a female.  So, she had plastic surgery to fashion a vagina for her and at the same time remove her testicles.  She's happy and married a man even though she has XY chromosomes so is 'legally' a male.    So - Bondi would deny this young woman gender 'affirming' surgery because what?  Why should the state care what an individual does with his or her body?  Some poor souls are born with a penis and a vagina.  They wouldn't be able to have anything done about it because - um, 'reasons'?

"People need to realize something. Characteristics of sex expression in biology are 98% binary.   Worldwide 2% of the human population, just by virtue of quirks of biology and genetic mutation falls somewhere outside of the 98% and within the 2%.  That means that there are some 68 million human beings on this planet right now who have conditions having to do with anomalous expression of sex characteristics and chromosomes outside of the binary .  Some percentage of these people end up with gender dysphoria.   But that means that barring doctors from performing gender affirming care and threatening sanction is going to by default impact many people who do not have gender dysphoria at all, as well as impact those who do.  This is just going to mean downgraded medical care for a lot of people.  https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities  Here is a site that lists some of the conditions people can have that are chromosomal abnormalities, that require things like hormone replacement therapy for care that has nothing whatsoever to do with being transgender.  If you are one of the people that is against transgender individuals, just consider how small that community is based on the hard data, and how much this administration is overreacting for ideological reasons.   The Trump administration dismissed all of the transgender military members.   Out of an active duty military of 1.31 million people across the branches, the administration let go of 15,000 recruits.

That being said 100:1 number can't be given outright because less than 1% of the population is trans, so that just means they have approximately equal ratio. If that number is even true.  And although I'm firm and consistent, medicine isn't black and white, there are nuances. I'd admit I don't know what cases the 100 minors, nor the 1 trans, received treatment. But as a matter of policy it's generally not legal to have gender affirmation regardless, and I'm sure there are exceptions amongst both that necessitate, I'm discussing overall policies and not going to enter the nitty gritty of which minor should undergo the gender affirmation.  If you'd like to get into that, give me cases that you think they should, and maybe I'll agree. But so far everything you've given I've been consistently against even when they are from cis.",NexexUmbraRs,2025-04-27T11:37:07,1
