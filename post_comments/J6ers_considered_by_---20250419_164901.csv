Republicans being wrong about who is fit for office is why things are so terrible.,wonkalicious808,2025-04-19T16:59:44,41
"Some crazy times we are living through. Right wing propaganda has rewired these people to believe wrong is right, 34 felonies are ok if you like his agenda, a grape charge doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt like the judge, owing 600M to NY for tax fraud doesn‚Äôt matter because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a blue state anyway‚Äù.  And despite hours of video that we all watched, J6 was ok because they were standing up for their leader.  It‚Äôs all insanity and I don‚Äôt know how we ever get back to where wrong is still wrong.",Riversmooth,2025-04-19T17:33:36,28

"Up is down and left is right. None of it makes any sense. These are the people who are all about law enforcement and the thin blue line, but the j6ers beat capital police for their supreme leader and a lie about election rigging.",modern_idiot13,2025-04-19T18:46:26,7
"I can‚Äôt see one of the reply comments (hallmark of being blocked for some reason), giving me some in depth something something about how it‚Äôs not about the crimes and mansplaining fascism to me, not getting that my comment was sarcasm & snark.",emory_2001,2025-04-19T21:52:51,2
