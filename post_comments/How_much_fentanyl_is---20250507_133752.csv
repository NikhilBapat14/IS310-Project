Fentanyl seizure is just the ruse.  It has never been the underlying problem.,thieh,2025-05-07T13:42:56,9
"This part here needs to be stressed more. It's not immigrants that are to blame - no matter how much they want that to be true.  >According to a 2023 report from the Department of Homeland Security, most fentanyl is primarily found and seized from vehicles driven by US citizens at official ports of entry.",dingoselfies,2025-05-07T14:04:38,7
"I'm so sick of this bs of we're doing this guy's look good things, meanwhile our administration is currently outwardly extorting other countries to give Musk everything he wants to expand his starlink bs.  Then there are women being forced to carry a dead fetus to term for weeks because of anti abortion laws in some states.  So so much more disgusting outright in your face evil.  Go to hell with your graphs. Get a damn brain. ",arilupe,2025-05-07T13:48:35,5
"Here's the data from the report:   >About 760 pounds of fentanyl was seized at US borders in March—about 24% more than the prior month.  >Year to date (Jan-Mar), authorities have seized approximately 2,398 pounds of fentanyl at US borders. That is 49% less than had been seized by the same point in 2024.  >Most fentanyl is primarily found and seized from vehicles driven by US citizens at official ports of entry. Between January and March 2025, 91% of all confiscated fentanyl was intercepted at these official entry points.  >Although there are legal ports of entry throughout the US, fentanyl is primarily trafficked across the Southwest Border (US-Mexico), with 88% of it passing through official southwest ports of entry and 9% seized elsewhere along the Southwest Border.  >Year to date, 2,330 pounds of fentanyl have been seized at the Southwest border, 67 pounds have been seized at coastal/interior borders (seaports and airports), and 1 pound has been seized along the northern border with Canada.  Let us know if you have any suggestions to make this data more accessible. Our goal is to update the page monthly as new data from the DEA becomes available.",USAFacts,2025-05-07T13:40:46,2

"It's also important to note that the data reported on drug seizures at US borders only reflects the quantities that US Customs and Border Protection has *discovered.*   According to estimates by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the reported figures under-represent the drugs trafficked into the country. In 2021, the [DHS estimated](https://ohss.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023_0703_plcy_fiscal_year_2022_border_security_metrics_report_2021_data_0.pdf) that they intercepted around 3% of the cocaine — the only drug measured in the study — trafficked through official ports of entry.   In contrast, DHS estimates that around 80% of people attempting to cross the border between ports of entry are intercepted, suggesting that the actual amount of fentanyl trafficked through unauthorized channels is also *under counted*, but to a lesser extent than through official ports.",USAFacts,2025-05-07T14:14:46,0
