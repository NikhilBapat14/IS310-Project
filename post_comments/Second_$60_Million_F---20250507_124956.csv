"National Security Risk. Used parts and other information in the jet will be used by foreign agents. Loose lips sink ships because any information can be used by foreign enemies.

The commander in chief is responsible for the military.  The president appointed Hegseth to run it.  He couldn't get a janitor job at the Pentagon under any other administration.  Procedes to retire the most decorated honorable patriotic generals.  Everyone who is experienced & loyal to the constitution is being cleaned out.,thelegochef,2025-05-07T18:56:53,1
Your comment doesn’t prove anything. The jet that the article is about had a failed landing attempt and crashed. It has nothing to do with anyone you just mentioned.,BlazedJerry,2025-05-07T20:13:53,1
