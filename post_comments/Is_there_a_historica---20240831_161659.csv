"We would have made George Washington a king in all but name if he let us.  Other than that, its hard to think of anyone else, especially after they served a first term, which usually exposes some flaws that detract from the initial hype.  Reagan and FDR probably come close, but not to the cult level we see in Trump fans.",houinator,2024-08-31T17:35:53,75
Several. Huey Long comes to mind. His close aid assassinated him when he saw how dangerous he and his movement had become.,Outrageous-Intern278,2024-08-31T21:55:02,20
I wasn’t around yet to experience it firsthand but I get the impression there was quite a cult of personality surrounding JFK during his presidency (hell they sampled him for the [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Personality_(song))),bgplsa,2024-08-31T23:13:18,9

"Barack Obama was very much this exact type of cult of personality mindset.  If you're 45 and don't recall the ""HOPE"" poster, the metric ton of merch and ""Change You Can Believe In"" craziness, I don't know what to tell you.  What's more shocking is that Trump was able to pull that sort of scheme off.  Hype marketing has been a big thing on the left much longer than it has been on the right, ranging from AOC and Bernie Sanders back through union organizing and far-left militant groups.  It's lowest common denominator politicking, but it's newish to the right.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2024-08-31T16:52:49,-35

"From what I understand Reagan was highly popular in his time, in spite of a robust counterculture against him. Seems like he lost a lot of that support with multiple scandals at the end of his term like Iran-Contra and the 1987 Financial Collapse.  But oddly enough he didn't become venerated to near God-like status until the Recession in 2008, even though his policies and the precedents he set bear a significant amount of the blame. Then suddenly he was our greatest modern President and never to be questioned in any capacity, because..... reasons.",sauronthegr8,2024-08-31T21:00:04,34
"AFAIK, Huey Long was shot by Carl Weiss, the son-in-law of Judge Benjamin Pavy, one of Long's political opponents. Weiss was then shot by Long's bodyguard, who may have also accidentally shot Long who was caught in the crossfire. Not a ""close aid"".",cameronreilly,2024-08-31T23:51:10,15
I was gonna say Jackson as well. Ideally someone with a deeper formation in the historical period can throw some light on whether the levels of cult-following were comparable.,Sufficient_Hunter_61,2024-09-01T02:31:49,3

The hope poster I do remember but I don't recall the same intensity... No cars covered with it and such. Bernie actually might be closer.,demosthenes131,2024-08-31T17:09:52,16
"> Barack Obama was very much this exact type of cult of personality mindset. If you're 45 and don't recall the ""HOPE"" poster, the metric ton of merch and ""Change You Can Believe In"" craziness, I don't know what to tell you.  There was definitely huge support and emotionality behind Obama.  The most I had ever seen but I was not alive for JFK so I have trouble comparing against that.    Two key differences though:  1. Obama didn't constantly test his rabid supporters with things they would normally find outrageous and unacceptable.  For the most part he managed to live up to the idealized (well, to non-conservatives anyway) image that he and his PR managed to craft for himself.  While he was not a transformative Messiah-like figure as he was starting to get elevated to (Republicans made sure he could get little actually done), for the most part he was a rational, intelligent, measured, decent, likeable family man and President.  2. Obama also had massive international popularity even without being in the same kind of media/information bubble that his American supporters would have been in.  Trump on the other hand in most of the world is seen for what he really is, and thus is reviled except in a few authoritarian/far-right nations.",ptwonline,2024-08-31T19:39:16,33
"Nope.   Obama had a lot of support to start.    He lost a lot of support at the end of his 8 years.  There were things liberals wanted that he refused to budge on: environment, driving, Getting his Supreme Court pick.  He could have played hardball and did not.  And that pissed off a bunch of liberals.    Obama had lots of support because he came in with compassion and good plans.  When people wanted him to keep taking action he did not.   And here is where things are different.  He lost supporters among voter and among congress for it.    And trump loses no support no matter what he says or does.   His worshiper support the lunacy no matter what.",MontEcola,2024-08-31T21:16:34,11

"That…doesn’t match my memory whatsoever.  Do you have any articles from the time to back that up?  My experience is if anything the complete opposite.  2008 saw the rise of the Occupy Wallstreet movement and leftist populism exploded.  Reagan always had a mixed reputation after the final years of his presidency based on what your politics were, but that was the turning point where his casual personal reputation tanked because everyone was actively speaking out on Reaganomics to such a degree even nonpolitical people understood.",Welpe,2024-09-01T00:17:19,23
Well shoot. IMA have to go back and read about this. I was parroting received wisdom given many years ago by a political historian but he apparently had an agenda. I apologize for posting without ascertaining the veracity of the claim. Thank you for the call out.,Outrageous-Intern278,2024-09-01T01:33:48,12

"Bernie certainly had an intense following but it was relatively small in comparison. Obama was by far more widespread.     And maybe not the Hope poster specifically, but there was definitely painted cars.

"Yes I agree. I was an adult for his entire era and remember it well. Reagan was lionized by the same segment of the population who love Trump now, but also by conservative intellectuals. There was robust opposition, but he held the center. The Iran-Contra affair finally tarnished him a bit, but he was never affected by any of the financial troubles of the late 80s—those were his successor’s problem.   Once his dementia was revealed, both praise and blame were muted through the early 90s. There was another round of myth-making when he died, which coincided with Bush Jr’s wars going sideways. But I don’t recall anyone blaming him for the 2008 recession. There was widespread anger over the financialization of the economy, but he wasn’t singled out for blame.   In the Trump era, he’s largely ignored, as the god-emperor has no interest in sharing any glory. The adulation he received in his time was impressive, but not quite as unhinged and cultish as Trump’s. Assuming Trump is defeated and the GOP in disarray come November, it’s possible Reagan’s star could rise again as a template for “conservatism with a smile”. But I don’t expect that to attract much support from anyone born after 1980.",coleman57,2024-09-01T02:37:53,11
"No problem, I remember talking about it on a podcast a few years ago. Didn’t know much about his story at the time and was surprised his assassination isn’t a better-known story. I guess he wasn’t well-liked by certain groups of people.",cameronreilly,2024-09-01T02:58:53,3

"If the Republicans want a move in a different direction, I actually think the only reasonable approach is to pretend whatever they're doing is a ""return to small c conservatism"", ""lighthouse upon a hill"" ""as Reagan thought us"".   It's the only other figure that could appeal to Republicans who are obsessed with Trump. All these moderates who feel left behind by Republicans will give them another look just to see. Going back all the way to the 50s, only Eisenhower could even stand in as a symbol for what they could be. And Eisenhower just doesn't have the cachet. So, yes, when it comes time to move on, if there comes a time to move on, it's going to be a return to worshipping Reagan regardless of policy. It's either that or Trump having such a stranglehold on the party that he replaces reagan as that figure. But Republicans can't survive without that.",naughtyobama,2024-09-01T08:30:43,2
