"SCOTUS: ""Are we a joke to you?""  Trump: ""Yes.""  Rest of America: ""Also yes.""",GeneReddit123,2025-04-30T05:39:39,30
"Trump's pathetic, ethically-challenged lawyers at the hopelessly politicized DOJ have been arguing that Trump is simply unable to bring back the people he illegally deported to MAGA's El Salvadoran gulag.   Now their client is bragging that he can, in fact, bring them back any time he pleases, but he simply refuses to obey the law.   Trump had no case before this, but now there is not even a laughable argument to be made.  Trump stands nakedly in contempt of the law without even a fig leaf of defense.     If this stands, we are a nation without laws that mean anything.  The Republic is dead.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T05:57:41,14
- takes a real man to admit a mistake and correct a mistake and that leaves trump and 99% MAGAs unable to do so. no surprise here at all,decaturbob,2025-04-30T05:44:20,12

"I mean, it's pretty obvious IMHO that he just generally looks down upon people of Salvadorian descent whether they're in America legitimately or not. Various ethnic purges will be enacted under various excuses (i.e. clearing out the illegal immigrants, criminals, unproductive members of society and culturally ""un-American"" people) and the masses will hail the measures too because people are easily led like sheep.   Look at any ethnic purges in history (the Jews in 20th century Germany or 19th century Russia, the Bosniaks 1990s Serbia, the Armenians in early 20th century Turkey, Etc) and they all start the same way.    You have been warned. ",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T07:41:19,2

I kinda want homegrowns to get deported by mistake next maybe more people will give a shit that the federal government is paying taxpayer $$ to El Salvador to send people to gulags when we have plenty of prisons and cells right here in America,iishouldchangemyname,2025-04-30T05:47:33,1

"Sadly, the tactic being employed is to fill the air with so much noise, as frequently as possible, while deflecting all legal enforcement through political party control of the system.  This tactic allows a lot of illegal actions and the hope is they drift out of the public sphere of media by something even more terrible so they get away with it",RobbyRock75,2025-04-30T06:36:53,3
"I understand your frustrations, but be careful.  Dehumanizing anyone is a dangerous road.  The Trump administration is very human.  They just happen to be acting out the worst of humanity’s impulses.  They could change if they wanted to.",Cassiopeia299,2025-04-30T06:28:11,8
- funny how others in trump admin clearly admit it was...so they are now lying too? Turn off foxnews and newsmax,decaturbob,2025-05-01T05:26:51,1
"You’re completely right. The tactic of flooding the zone with shit is working. In part because Americans generally have declining attention spans and little to no object or subject permeance.   Which leads to their next tactic, which is keeping Americans stupid. Defunding schools, universities, and generally attacking teachers and the school system. End goal is make enough people dumb so they root for you even when you’re shafting them.",iishouldchangemyname,2025-04-30T07:56:24,1
