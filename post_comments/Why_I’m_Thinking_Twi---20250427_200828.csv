"I'm in the UK, and I REALLY wanted to return to NY this summer.  Went for the very first time in Feb, and absolutely loved it, but this was obviously before all hell let loose.  Now though?  Nah, not a chance.  It is absolutely not worth the risk whatsoever.  I'm already in the process of booking a break in Toronto.  It's an absolute shame as well as I met some real nice people in New York.  Maybe I can return in a few years.",PizzaDude75,2025-04-27T20:16:14,14

Tourism is drying up along with business travel. Add to this the loss of conventions and conference travel and it will cost the economy in the billions.   The multiplier effect is so great that not only businesses and employment will suffer. Demand for the USD will continue to weaken as tourists stay away.   The Moron in Chief is now trying to sell tariffs as 'external revenue' in place of income taxes as if exporters are paying these levies. Importers pay these tariffs and adjust sale prices which are passed onto the consumer.  While a falling dollar makes it cheaper to buy for tourists it also flows onto increasing domestic inflation on top of tariffs. Reduced buying power of the dollar further increases the cost of imports and is an own goal.  If both international and domestic tourists stay away then many businesses dependent on this trade will turn turtle.    I,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-27T21:01:13,2
