"The Dutch government is a coalition of parties. All that's happened is that the coalition decided to stop working together due to a policy disagreement - namely the largest party wanted certain harsher asylum policies and the other parties didn't.  This is something that can happen in parliamentary systems where no party has a majority (common under proportional representation). It's a feature, not a bug.  The current Prime Minister will now remain in post until the election later this year.  To answer your questions: No. Yes. Nothing will change. Nothing will change. Yes. There is still a government. There are still police. No. Only if you have a particular interest in the complexities of internal Dutch politics.",lizardispenser,2023-07-14T14:08:57,10
"Government 'collapse' does not mean what you might think it means. It means that the cabinet fell, not that the state collapsed. In a parliamentary system the PM and his ministers need to have the confidence of a majority of representatives or they must leave office. In this case however it was the coalition of ministers that did not want to continue together. If you're only familiar with a presidential system, think of it as somewhat like a change of administration, just earlier than the scheduled four years.   As I mentioned [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/14tlto9/eli5_what_does_it_mean_that_the_dutch_government/jr3f75w/?context=3) on ELI5:  The Dutch cabinet consists of ministers and state secretaries of different political parties. On to the issue of immigration it turned out that the political parties could no longer find common ground. Therefore their cooperation ceased. That is what is meant by collapse.      Now there will be new elections organised for later this year. In the meantime the ministers of some of these parties will continue to cooperate, but in a more restrictive function, which is called a demissionary status. It means they can no longer implement new policies and laws, only continue with the old ones or act during acute crises.      They will continue in this caretaker capacity until a new cabinet can be installed. A new cabinet is formed during the formation process after elections are held, but this process can take quite a while. Essentially it means that certain political parties form a new coalition and decide what their common plan is and who gets which ministerial position.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2023-07-14T14:41:01,7
"There's already an interim government in place, they'll schedule elections ASAP and in the meantime they'll continue as the happiest nation on earth.",Olderscout77,2023-07-15T19:28:58,3

In practical terms it just means that there will be an election because the Dutch cabinet no longer enjoys the support of a majority of the parliament. Life goes on as normal. The parliament produced after the election may (or may not) produce a coalition government that can agree on an approach to this topic.,pensivegargoyle,2023-07-19T12:13:52,1
"Correct.  To add: Many people see this not as a policy disagreement but as a political power play. The government (VVD/D66/CDA/CU) is highly unpopular and the non-VVD parties in the current coalition are projected to lose a lot of seats in parliament. At the same time the opposition doesn't seem strong enough to hold elections right now because the main two left parties are still discussing a merger, a popular politician (Omtzigt) who left CDA still hasn't formed his own party and the BBB (populist pro-farmer party) had just had a very big win in provincial/senate elections and are now in dire need of good politicians before they can actually go into elections.  The VVD (the party that basically caused the collaps) seems to come out of this mess quite strong. And by pretending to be strongly anti-migration they also hope to win back some votes from other right-wing parties.",Hapsbum,2023-07-17T14:58:21,1
