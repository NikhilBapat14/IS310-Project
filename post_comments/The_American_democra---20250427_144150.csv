" I know that the term ""fascism"" gets used often and tends to fall on deaf ears as Republicans continue to dismiss the label as some kind of vague, pejorative term that means very little to them the more they hear it. Almost as if they believe the more they are called ""fascists,"" the less likely they are to *be* fascists.   That being said, see how many parallels you can draw between MAGA and fascism based on the words of these experts:  Robert Paxton, author of ""*Anatomy of Fascism""* explains what mobilizes fascists:  - a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions - the primacy of the group... - the belief that one’s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies. - dread of the group’s decline. - the need for closer integration of a purer community... - the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain... - the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason - the beauty of violence when [it is] devoted to the group’s success. - the right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint...  Jason Stanley, author of *""How Fascism Works,""* describes fascist tactics:  - The mythical past—used to invoke a nostalgia for a fictional time when the nation was great... - Propaganda—to attack enemies, to justify violence... to support the authoritarian leader. - Anti-intellectualism—to attack the media, universities, and scientists when they contradict the strong man’s authority. - Unreality—supporting conspiracy theories that tarnish the “Other” along with an outright denial of facts. - Hierarchy—espousing a “natural order”... - Victimhood—casting “Us” as victims of “Them”, who are taking resources from “Us” and demanding special rights. - Law and order—using laws to justify violence... - Sexual anxiety... - Dismantling of public welfare and unity...  Then there's Laurence W. Britt, who published *""Fascism Anyone?""*, which includes a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism:  - Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism - Disdain for the importance of human rights - Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause - The supremacy of the military/avid militarism - Rampant sexism - A controlled mass media - Obsession with national security - Religion and ruling elite tied together - Power of corporations protected - Power of labor suppressed or eliminated - Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts - Obsession with crime and punishment - Rampant cronyism and corruption - Fraudulent elections  Let's face it, MAGA covers almost all the bases here.  This movement is fueled by a deep aversion towards outsiders, by ultra nationalistic and nativist attitudes, and by notions expressing the idea that Trump and his supporters are *true* patriots, *true* Americans, and are thus entitled to rights, freedoms, privileges and immunities that others are not.  The importance of human rights only extends to those within the MAGA circle. Republicans are eager to roll back civil rights and protections for marginalized groups, foreigners, and many who exist outside of a white, Christian hegemony.  For decades, Republicans have been waging their culture wars against ""enemies"" and ""scapegoats"" that take the form of ""woke,"" radical leftist and secular forces that present an ever-growing danger to a conservative, heteronormative America.  Republicans will justify interventionism and expansionism when it suits their goals.  They are driven by misogyny and antiquated notions about gender norms and women's independence. They incessantly complain about the mistreatment of white males and insist it's a result of a ""crisis of masculinity"" caused by ""the left.""  The Trump admin attacks the media, defunds independent journalism, stifles the free press, restricts access to information, flags historical content, online images and articles, and even hundreds of terms for removal, and all while whining about ""censorship"" and the ongoing threat to *their* ""free speech.""   But when *they* are in a position to exercise their authority over the press and the spread of ideas, they will justify their efforts to suppress opposing viewpoints, control the mass media and manipulate information.   Trump and his allies have also been threatening to use the power of the DOJ to seek retribution against political opponents. They've proposed using national security measures to target protestors and political dissidents.  Proponents of a Christian nationalist agenda are embedded deep in our government, and they have more power than ever to implement a faith-based ""rule of law.""  The GOP's goals are to destroy what's left of the labor movement, protect employers, corporations and special interests, cut taxes for the rich, widen the wealth gap and install corporate cronies and billionaires into positions of power.  Republicans are bullying universities and students, sending literal ""thought police"" to oversee academic departments, are threatening to dissolve these departments and programs, are demanding that foreign students be observed and reported on and that universities teach Trump admin approved ""viewpoints.""  They're aiming to dismantle higher education, slash funding for scientific research, and fracture the public education system, which will disproportionately impact underserved communities.  Their law and order rhetoric is meant to incite hostility towards minorities, immigrants and marginalized groups.  Their obsession with crime and punishment extends to their constant threats against anyone who poses an obstacle to their agenda, to their disregard for basic constitutional rights, to Trump's attacks on law firms and judges, and to his punishment of anyone who has tried to hold him accountable in the past.  He's even issued threats towards those who investigated him for the role he played in facilitating January 6th and conspiring to overturn the 2020 election  Corruption, obstruction of justice and rampant cronyism are party tenets. Loyalty is a one way street with Trump and plays a major role in securing power and influence within his administration.  Trump has been abusing the powers of his executive to arrest, detain and/or deport a growing number of migrants, legal residents and even US citizens without due process.  His administration intends to end birthright citizenship and disregard the two-term presidential limit. Trump continues to take unilateral executive actions that have been deemed unlawful by the courts. His party has also displayed contempt for the constitution.  The Trump administration has been stripping civil servants of their protections and replacing them with MAGA loyalists, all while eliminating most areas of independent oversight.  Trump is openly defying court orders, overstepping congressional authority, flouting the constitution and violating the separation of powers.  Trump and his allies have and will continue to deny, subvert and overturn the results of any election they've lost.  Unfortunately, there aren't enough characters in a reddit post to highlight all the parallels, but it is nonetheless undeniable, fascism has taken root in this country, and its name is MAGA.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-27T17:12:44,872

"The news of our country’s death has been highly exaggerated (Mark Twain).  Trump may have taken advantage of a deadbeat Congress to circumvent the legislative branch, but the secondary checks and balances in our system have yet to kick in - e.g. SC, state lawsuits, civil suits, disbarment. Also his poll numbers are rapidly heading into the danger zone, which might result in Congress waking up to do their job - or worse for him: a blue wave. He who lives by executive order, will likely die by executive order.  I am not saying we should be complacent or not worried.

" The current state of our government raises serious concerns. Hypothetically, even if we see a return to some semblance of normalcy in four years, we face significant challenges. We would likely inherit a system where government services have been severely curtailed, key institutions dismantled, and regulations protecting citizens weakened, while potentially oppressive new laws have been enacted. The loss of experienced government employees has eroded institutional knowledge, and public trust in government is at a historic low. This has led to a significant brain drain, with limited incentives for skilled individuals to return.  Rebuilding government functions would be exponentially difficult due to funding cuts, lost revenue streams, and resource reallocation. This is compounded by the likely return of partisan gridlock, with a highly mobilized opposition base resistant to any initiative from the incoming administration. Even if attempts are made to address issues like campaign finance reform, such as overturning Citizens United, success is uncertain. The opposition has proven adept at obstruction, their base is likely to oppose any policy originating from the other side, and internal divisions may further undermine efforts.  The argument that dismantling the existing system will inevitably lead to something better overlooks historical precedent. Power vacuums following authoritarian regimes often result in the rise of equally problematic groups. A century from now, perhaps we'll witness that idealized society. Sadly, we're trapped in the present, enduring an indefinite period of struggle. While I deeply admire and support figures like AOC and Bernie, their current path, absent the gathering of a nationwide militia, seems unlikely to meaningfully address the systemic issues we face.  Despite this bleak outlook, surrender isn't an option. I refuse to succumb to despair. However, I feel it's crucial to be realistic about our prospects. We're not facing a future brimming with hope.",EveryManDies,2025-04-27T19:02:29,3

Democracy was a failed experiment because voters are satisfied with the sizzle and never demand the steak.  Midterm elections will be decided as to who provides the most satisfying sizzle.  Voters are incapable of going the full distance to actually force the politicians to give them the steak.

"Let's see, a Judge was arrested, *in her courtroom* using a warrant that NO ONE SIGNED but was authorized under the Alien Enemies Act, and under said law search warrants may also be executed without a Judge's signature and without any aforethought or warning.  Anyone who comes into your home without authorization should be treated like the home-invaders they lawfully are. This is not hyperbole, this is the point we have reached. Saving an image of your birth certificate in your phone along with a physical and up-to-date passport will not stop an arrest, Due Process has ceased and our government is moving U.S. Citizens to be held in prisons in foriegn countries (something *specifically* named in the Declaration Of Independence) with no intention of them returning alive.

"Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to “go out of your way to make trouble.” Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, “everyone” is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, “It’s not so bad” or “You’re seeing things” or “You’re an alarmist.”  And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the “German Firm” stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying “Jewish swine,” collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.",Hot-Minute-200,2025-04-27T17:02:15,3

"I'm not saying this is going to happen.  But imagine, hypothetically, a sizable contingent of the US military, perhaps lead unanimously by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, rolls up to the White House and sends MPs to arrest this entire administration. They make a media statement that these people are being arrested for the many, many crimes they have openly committed against the Constitution and the country. This statement includes an enormous number of crimes for which at least some evidence is plain and clear: the many illegal ways Trump and his family have made money off the office, the blatant illegality of the events following the 2020 election, the PPP loans, the illegal firings and dismantling of American cybersecurity by DOGE, everything. The military junta (and that's really the only way of describing who is taking control here) say that they will be temporarily suspending the government to keep order while they try the arrested parties in a military court which will have televised proceedings. The junta promises elections will be held after the trials are over. They justify their actions by referring to their oath to protect both the Constitution and the country from domestic enemies, and vow that they will relinquish control back to a civilian government as soon as they feel they have upheld that oath.

I do believe that the US came out of COVID so strong is because of the conservative nature of US laws and institutions (relative to other first world countries).  Now, back in the day if you wanted to get ""into"" republican politics, you'd turn on FOX and hear George Will and Krauthammer discuss politics from an intellectually consistent philosophy and an understanding of how the government works ( not denying that they never ran a positive story about a democrat for 20 years). Talk radio was more entertainment driven, more outlandish, but got the common folk to think that the uneducated, unexperienced in legislation talk show host knew WAY better than a lawyer that has spent a couple decades in Congress.  Trump saw the entertainment lane in politics and took it. The prolife base of the republican party was a simple fact, took no genius to see it, a crack head that needs a hit would tell them ""I'm the most pro life candidate ever"". It worked.

Scholars in the future will study what happened and come to a variety of conclusions.    Historical dramas will be set in our time and probably get half of it wrong, but still provide good entertainment for the people of the future.

"Well, tbh. Looking at how it was made, what it didn't account for and what it failed to do, I don't mind the idea of getting together and trying to figure out something new. I don't think the American democratic republic that we've had for 236 years is worth fighting for. I think it's a pretty good framework to keep in mind for something else.   But that's an ideal that's extremely unlikely to happen unless we have a big boy revolution or civil war. And even after the first civil war, we dropped the ball on Reconstruction.   The interior of the country has way too much voting power for how low its population is. SCOTUS needs to be term limited because it's turned into a political tool. There needs to be more constraints on the executive branch. We need a better way to amend the Constitution because we'll never get 2/3 of the Senate on the same page on it ever again. We could probably use amendments dealing with money in politics and making it easier for new political parties to arise when the Democrats and Republicans fail us, because both parties are too big to fail at this point due to the sheer amount of money they can pump into campaigns for name recognition and how much media has been captured by special interests.   I dunno. I don't see a way forward with things as they are right now.

"To add to this, the disturbing ways in which Hitler's rule paralleled Trump's. I think the author likely wrote it wanting this comparison to be made, so take it with a grain of salt:  >\[Hitler's\] government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His ""unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,"" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir *Zwischen Weißem und Braunem Haus*. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.  >There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos—and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.  >Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.  >He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as ""the greatest actor in Europe,"" and wrote to a friend, ""I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history."" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake"" and ""put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.""  >He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.  This is [from a 2019 Newseek article about Hitler](https://www.newsweek.com/hitler-incompetent-lazy-nazi-government-clown-show-opinion-1408136). I think the reason people assume Hitler was a more effective leader is he pulled off his fake ""disciplined tough guy"" act much more convincingly than Trump does.

"There are so many obvious parallels yet people in America seem either powerless or apathetic.

And governments like mine in the UK are to scared to call Trump etc. out, because of the economy.

Nobody tried to rein in unfettered presidential powers back then, because only third worlders were getting murdered for the sake of profits. It's now metastasized. Trump is only a symptom, and an opportunist who seized a system already flawed. It's no longer a problem of Dems vs Republicans, or which presidents, but that executive power can be abused without consequences.   Can the American people come together and demand executive power be reined in, and then indict current and former presidents (irrespective of party) who had abused the executive power?

"No offence but none of you are doing anything despite months of undeniable evidence that it's: under threat, seriously threatened, reaching emergency levels now, point of no return come and gone, and the final bell of arresting judges who don't comply.   There is, quite literally, no way for that last act to happen in a democracy. That was apparently the one last hope that there was an institution capable of reigning in an autocrat who has been single-handedly creating and enacting laws on behalf of himself.   Do you guys get that? If you have a single man with absolutely unchecked power who is unlawfully controlling the law, the police, the courts, the institutions, the universities and media and trade, and not a single body able to stop him, there is absolutely no way to call that a democracy or to pretend it isn't a dictatorship.  It's not a freaky new form of democracy, it's not strained or  nominal democracy or corrupt democracy - it is a dictatorship by every single metric.   And everybody watched it happening, saying 'i sure hope somebody is going to find a magic solution to this', and nobody stopped him.   The time to protest was years ago. Probably around a hundred years. This was an inevitable consequence of a system that allows 1 single man to write laws that the country must obey, a man with no oversight.    It's arguable that that system is itself a natural consequence of a country and constitution founded on slavery and built around the sacred principle of glorious freedom for everyone! As long as that everyone is the ruling class, obv, the non-favoured races are free to obey and make money for the real citizens. You all finally abolished slavery but stayed so loyal to the system built for the strong to make money from the weak, and even now it seems nobody would consider a new constitution that is based on all men being equal, or consider protesting because even though millions of you say you're unhappy, the slaveowners control your health insurance and wages and stuff and you're all ok with that.    You've had hundreds of years to update the rules and the ethos, to create a system where civilians hold more power than corporations and where the leader is answerable to the populace. You've had 6 months to figure out 'hey, Trump wasn't joking when he said he'd abolish democracy and rule as a dictator'.   Sorry, but nobody did anything. There were so many last warnings, and the bravest of you went out waving placards (historical success rate against authoritarianism / dictatorships: nil? I think it's nil).   Nobody formed unions, nobody went on strike, nobody enacted civil disobedience, nobody chained themselves to the senate or the white house or followed Trump around with a megaphone (old school, but it was effective against Churchill for the UK feminists back in the day).   Nobody stopped him, and now nobody can. He has control of every establishment.      And you're all so, so wedded to the system that gave none of you any rights to representation or powers of protest of civic freedoms that even now you refuse to consider the possibility of making anything better. You just say 'how dare they criticise our fine democracy! It's enough to make a man sit back and watch the country being dismantled' as the country is dismantled ",moubliepas,2025-04-27T18:36:57,0

"Donald Trump didn’t rise to power because he’s almighty or anything. He’s not even a good businessman. He rose to power because the system is heavily flawed.

I agree that we shouldn’t give up, but we also need to recognize that we have never truly been a democracy. We have made continuous progress toward becoming one throughout the years, but with Trump that progress has been halted.

">They act like it’s over and we’ve lost. I refuse to give up.   I've had an OK life but it has involved a lot of trauma since childhood repeatedly as long as I was aware. Naturally, I suppose, found myself in EMS. Recently, at the end of 5 continuous years of national hell (see, Lebanon 2019  -  present day) it was getting too much.  We just went through a major war, and the cease-fire process continues (Beirut just got hit today, but no causalities so far as i know as the IDF warned well in advance).  After the war mostly ended, and the shit I saw and experience (not my first war, not even my 5th, but this one was different - at least for me), and multiple lung-related infections (war + viral infections not good for a person already struggling, it really was getting too much.  I swear on whatever might be out there, this has lit a fire under my ass like never before.  I'm also American. And I know what it's like to live in a democracy, and I know the opportunities it provides people like my parents fleeing war (the irony, history rhyming and all). and that's why I am American.  It's not just an idea. I'm literally the product of our highest ideals and aspirations.  I too, refuse, to give up. I will not obey advance. Democratic institutions and values, aspirations and progress, I have lived the consequences of not having it or enough of it.  In short, it fucking really sucks.  Too many loved ones, too many friends, too many values I hold dear live in these United States.  I'm not giving up on our democratic republic. I suggest to any of you who wants to continue to build a more perfect union, one in which we keep bending the arch of history toward justice, refuse to give up too.  I promise you the grass isn't greener, and seconds count here. Every day you delay taking this seriously and, lawfully, constitutionally, and non-violently, resist this regime it will get harder and harder and before you know it happens almost all at once and it's gone forever. And the glory days may never come back.  Please do not obey in advance.  They're more terrified of We the People than they would ever let on. But that's what every authoritarian type regime fears the most. Its own people.  I am proud of you. Keep up the good fight. Too many Americans gave their lives for our nation, too many revolutionaries who made America better. I know our dark history well, not trying to minimize it. Hell, I had American designed, made, and shipped bombs falling around me not too long ago lol.  But you gotta sometimes see it from the outside to really appreciate what it means to have what we have, and more importantly, the potential we have.  I've been too  busy to respond and have had some internet/electricity issues, but look at a post I submitted on r/EMS and I betcha most if not all are Americans. Look at how giving and generous they were with their comments and what they have offered me.   Our better angles are already here, we just need to bring them out. It's within every American, because when you partisan out of the equation, it turns out most of us really care about the same things. The second you politicize shit, you get these insane splits.   Focus on the Americans you can reach, focus on every American. We need every American to refuse to give up and not obey in advance.  I beg you. For your sake and the sake of my loved ones and for the sake of this rich, albeit morally complex and at many times downright evil, nation of ours.

"Here's a series of quotes from an old article by Lon Fuller, former professor of Jurisprudence at Harvard, who wrote quite a bit on Nazi laws and those of other dictatorial regimes and whether we could even call it ""law.""  Is it all starting to sound familiar yet?   >**Hitler declared that during the Roehm purge “the supreme court of the German people . . . consisted of myself""**  > In the first place, when legal forms became inconvenient, it was always possible for the Nazis to bypass them entirely and “to act through the party in the streets.” **There was no one who dared bring them to account for whatever outrages might thus be committed.**  >**In the second place, the Nazi-dominated courts were always ready to disregard any statute, even those enacted by the Nazis themselves, if this suited their convenience or if they feared that a lawyer-like interpretation might incur displeasure “above.”**  >... , **what in most societies is kept under  control by the tacit restraints of legal decency broke out in monstrous form under Hitler.**   >Indeed, so loose was the whole Nazi morality of law that it is not easy to know just what should be regarded as an unpublished or secret law. Since unpublishedinstructions to those administering the law could destroy the letter of any published law by imposing on it an outrageous interpretation, there was a sense in which the meaning of every law was “secret.” **Even a verbal order from Hitler that a thousand prisoners in concentration camps be put to death was at once an administrative direction and a validation of everything done under it as being “lawful.”**  And regarding what happens after all of this is over (if it does end, that is:)   >After the collapse of the Nazi regime the German courts were faced with a truly frightful predicament. It was impossible for  them to declare the whole dictatorship illegal or to treat as void every decision and legal enactment that had emanated from Hitler’s government. Intolerable dislocations would have resulted from any such wholesale outlawing of all that occurred over a span of twelve years. On the other hand, it was equally impossible to carry forward into the new government the effects of every Nazi perversity that had been committed in the name of law; any such course would have tainted an indefinite future with the poisons of Nazism.   >This predicament — which was, indeed, a pervasive one, affecting all branches of law — came to a dramatic head in a series of cases involving informers who had taken advantage of the Nazi terror to get rid of personal enemies or unwanted spouses. If all Nazi statutes and judicial decisions were indiscriminately “law,” then these despicable creatures were guiltless, since they had turned their victims over to processes which the Nazis themselves knew by the name of law. Yet it was intolerable, especially for the surviving relatives and friends of the victims, that these people should go about unpunished, while the objects of their spite were dead, or were just being released after years of imprisonment, or, more painful still, simply remained unaccounted for.  >The urgency of this situation does not by any means escape  Professor Hart. Indeed, he is moved to recommend an expe¬  dient that is surely not lacking itself in a certain air of despera¬  tion. He suggests that a retroactive criminal statute would have  been the least objectionable solution to the problem. This statute  would have punished the informer, and branded him as a criminal,  for an act which Professor Hart regards as having been perfectly  legal when he committed it.  >On the other hand, Professor Hart condemns without qualification those judicial decisions in which the courts themselves undertook to declare void certain of the Nazi statutes under which the informer’s victims had been convicted. One cannot help raising at this point the question whether the issue as presented by Professor Hart himself is truly that of fidelity to law. Surely it would be a necessary implication of a retroactive criminal statute against informers that, for purposes of that statute at least, the Nazi laws as applied to the informers or their victims were to be regarded as void. With this turn the question seems no longer to be whether what was once law can now be declared not to have been law, but rather who should do the dirty work, the courts or the legislature.  > **With this turn the question seems no longer to be whether what was once law can now be declared not to have been law, but rather who should do the dirty work, the courts or the legislature*  And, to sum up the basic argument that underlies The Morality of Law (1964):  > To me there is nothing shocking in saying that a dictatorship which clothes itself with a tinsel of legal form can so far depart from the morality of order, from the inner morality of law itself, that it ceases to be a legal system. When a system calling itself law is predicated upon a general disregard by judges of the terms of the laws they purport to enforce, when this system habitually cures its legal irregularities, even the grossest, by retroactive statutes, when it has only to resort to forays of terror in the streets, which no one dares challenge, in order to escape even those scant restraints imposed by the pretence of legality - when all these things have become true of a dictatorship, it is not hard for me, at least, to deny to it the name of law",Celestial_Mechanica,2025-04-28T14:23:25,1

Yes, play hardball.

"The United States of America under the Articles of Confederation only look like a failed state if you start from the false assumption that they actually were a state. The clue is in the wording: the states were states. The Articles bound them together not as a single nation but as a confederation of nations.   And those states were doing fine as small republics. After all even though 90% of their combined population lived with a day's travel of the ocean or a navigable river they had just ousted the greatest naval power in the world.   Their main problem was the debt incurred to win that war but there were ways to deal with that. Unfortunately the way the newly empowered small landholders and militia members preferred to do so was largely at the expense of the holders of that debt who were international creditors and the large landholders and wealthy merchants who both owned debt themselves and hoped to secure more financing from those same international investors.   The federalist movement that culminated in the Constitution in 1787 wasn't about reform. A strong central government wasn't needed to guarantee freedom (for those lucky enough to have it by then). It was needed to drive the westward expansion to acquire more agricultural and mineral resources and allow the USA to take its rightful place as one of the great powers. It was needed for empire.  - **edited** because I mistyped the date of the ratification of the Constitution, of all things.",yo2sense,2025-04-27T22:47:10,1

"It’s meant to build up, both in size and in frequency towards sustained protests and a strike.  The first (4/5) was coordinated by a combined effort of several grassroots organizations and had an unexpected and incredible turnout of over 5 million.  The second (4/19) did not have the participation of all of the previous organizations; some called for protests, some called for community volunteering & outreach, and some stayed quiet to focus efforts on the next protest. Despite the mixed messaging and lack of coordination, protests on 4/19 apparently had a turnout of 4 million.  The same grassroots organizations have coordinated again for the next two protests: one on 5/1, followed shortly by one on 5/3.  There are also various boycotts that have been happening since January that last from one day to one week.  Americans (in general) are not comfortable with or prepared for mass boycotts or protests. We are not accustomed to sustained discomfort, delayed gratification or to denying ourselves completely for a greater purpose.  The protests are meant to build these muscles, because they will be necessary for us to be successful. Many Americans have never protested in their lives. Some are scared to start. Repeated, peaceful protests break the ice for newcomers and get out the word that the resistance is building.  This one on 5/1 is the first on a weekday. This one is meant to draw in people that have not been able to participate in the weekend protests. For those that have been committed to the weekend protests, it may be the first time they are leaving work for a lunch, an hour, an afternoon, a day, to protest. They are getting their first taste of what a strike will require of them. And if it’s anything like the boycotts or the weekend protests, after doing it, many will realize it’s not as scary as they thought and it’s something they CAN actually accomplish. For others, it’s a low-stakes test that will show them the loose ends they WILL need to address in order to strike.  Once there are enough people showing up consistently to every boycott or protest (over 3.5% of the population), then it will be time to strike. But it can’t happen until enough people are there. People need to prove FIRST that they can and will show up. Nothing will kill the resistance quicker than calling for a strike too early and burning out the millions who showed up early.  Until there are enough people willing to take action, we spread the word, we learn and exercise our rights, we practice boycotting/calling out/protesting. We network, we meet our local community and learn its needs, we build community support, we push our representatives to serve our needs. We continue to build up our tolerance for discomfort and delayed gratification. We pick apart and unravel our learned helplessness, and lower our tolerance for this bs.

"You say that we are a representative democracy, then go on to say that we're ""truly not"" a democracy which is confusing. We are, in fact, a democracy. We're a representative democracy, like you mentioned. We are not a direct democracy, which I assume is what you're trying to say. However, nobody claims that we are a direct democracy (including the article). As I said, we're a federal constitutional democratic republic.   Federal - We have a federal system of government, meaning that power is shared between a central (national) government and state governments. The Constitution outlines the division of powers between the federal government and the states.  Constitutional - we operate under the framework of the U.S. Constitution, which sets the foundational laws and principles for the government and guarantees certain rights and freedoms. The Constitution also defines the structure of the government, including the separation of powers into the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  Democratic - we are a representative democracy, meaning that citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. This includes electing the President, members of Congress, and other officials. The right to vote and participate in the democratic process is a key feature of the system.  Republic - we are a republic, meaning it does not have a monarch. Instead, political power rests with elected officials who represent the interests of the people. The head of state (the President) is elected, not hereditary.  The term ""democratic republic"" used in the article's title is correct.",EarthBowser,2025-04-28T19:55:03,1

"I think we're saying the same thing about the definitions.  We're definitely saying different things about ""democratic republic,"" which is fine. Agree to disagree. It's commonly used, but it doesn't mean it's accurate.  As you point out, and were correct in assuming my intent, we're not a direct democracy, which is the nature of the word. I don't know the exact history, but I feel like our government was the first popular representative democracy where the term ""democracy"" began to need a caveat.  While I realize the Electoral College is largely a formality of statewide (or precinct-wide) majority votes now, it is still, technically by statute, an independent electing body. This is not a minor detail, in my opinion, which is why ""democratic republic"" is inaccurate. Our electors are not obligated by law to cast a vote for the winner in a precinct and, therefore, not obligated to vote for whom the people vote. Until a Constitutional Amendment changes this definition, I'll always argue that we're not a democratic republic.  I guess I take issue because the meaning of words, in general, have been under assault for decades. Between euphemisms, altering meaning, and simply saying things that aren't held to account, I still feel like our media should be held to a higher standard than they are currently.

"A few days ago Rachel Maddow had a whole montage on things that the [Trump administration had to reverse course on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFKxLJuJPZA).  Some of these are due to circumstance rather than strictly and completely because of protest, and sometimes other forms of public criticism and legal challenges are significant as well, but the protests play a role. The Trump administration changes direction *a lot*, and part of it is because they are reacting to public opinion.  You’re never going to see Karoline Leavitt go out and confess that they’re changing policy specifically because of protests. They won’t admit it, it does matter.  A big example: We’ve heard a lot less out of Elon Musk lately. Yes, DOGE still exists, but his influence is substantially diminished. Tesla stock is doing terribly, partly as a result of changes in public opinion which includes protests centered on Tesla. Elon Musk himself has actually stated that attacks from the public are part of why he is withdrawing from government.  Harvard, I guarantee, would not have stood up to Trump’s demands if it didn’t have the sense that a large segment of the public was behind it. Columbia University didn’t, and it’s not because they’re a more fascist campus, it’s because Trump’s approval rating fell substantially between when Columbia folded and when Harvard resisted… and that’s influenced by the protests.  This stuff matters, and it does slow Trump. Protesting isn’t the only thing and in some ways it’s not the most important thing, but it is significant. It’s a very visible indication that they’re screwing up and people aren’t happy.  Trump isn’t a military tactician, he’s a gameshow host. His secretary of defense is a Fox News talking head. They’re TV people. They pay attention to ratings, it’s part of how they define their self-worth. It’s worth communicating to them that they are not well-liked.",ForgettableUsername,2025-04-27T21:32:28,3

"I didn't really ask why you would do that for MAGA voters, I asked **how** you would do that. Votes are rightfully secret, there is no vote registry you can draw on. There are registered republicans who voted Dem, and vice versa. How many of these are genuinely committed MAGA voters, and who are edgy teens who fell for misinformation? What about those who regret their vote now? Is your criteria simply ""voted for Trump once,"" or twice, or thrice? How can you tell who was coerced into voting that way? I'm saying that logistically, it's not very practical, or even possible. I imagine placing restrictions on those running for office, powers of elected officials, and genuine enforcement mechanisms would be a lot more feasible.  Post-civil war, disenfranchisement worked at the state level— states that seceded don't get a vote. Simple. This is clearly more complex, when there are many states that went to Trump by less than a percentage point, and the most hardcore blue/red states vote 2/3 that way at most.   This rot exists all over your country, and it exists because of inequality, hatred, and anti-intellectualism that has been allowed to fester for over 100 years at this point.

"^ What they said.  It's not just the tariffs, and it's not even just Trump.  It's the simple fact that the ruling party is *okay with it all*. Even if Trump magically vanished into the ether overnight, the GOP was still fully complicit in everything he did, and they're still there. So our allies have to weigh that fact as well, the fact that the ruling majority of the US government is perfectly okay with tearing up treaties, trade agreements, and even the rules-based international order.  But pales against this part, which is important enough to need quoting a second time:  >America guaranteed nobody will ever trust another country enough to dismantle its own nukes ever again.  **That**—in addition to the rest of what I said above—is why we have already passed a point of no return. In exchange for nuclear disarmament, the US promised to protect Ukraine if Russia attacked. I need to repeat that, because that is the crux of the entire issue as well as the spanner that has been thrown into the machinery of international politics. **In exchange for nuclear disarmament, the US promised to protect Ukraine if Russia attacked.** Instead, Krasnov is legitimizing Russian invasion, making the utterly absurd claim that ""not conquering all of Ukraine"" is somehow a concession by Russia, and saying that Ukraine shouldn't get *anything* else (like security guarantees) out of a peace deal.

My mom’s 1973 Ford Gran Torino with a 429 cu.in. engine cost $3500.   Their 1972 Oldsmobile Regency 98 was $5000. Comparable cars today would be around $55,000 and $80,000 around 15 times the price.

Try sent out all the manufacturing to produce it at a lower cost which made the CEO’s and shareholders even richer while wages in America stagnated. If America companies didn’t outsource all the manufacturing mostly to China America would still be manufacturing products and American wages would have kept up with inflation. Instead the companies made China rich through manufacturing and through China’s theft of American technology which they turned around and made their own versions to sell against international patent laws.

"On January 20th, they said it took 53 days for Hitler to consolidate power and dismantle the Weimar Constitution. It’s been 100 days, and Trump’s lawyers are still showing up to be humiliated in court. I don’t think he’s matching the Hitler timeline.  The justice department is on Trump’s side, but a lot of the competent talent left or was forced out. In most of the US, the police report to state and local government, not to the federal government. They’re not automatically on Trump’s side any more than state governors are.   Thus far, Trump has been largely (although not entirely) constrained by judges’ rulings. That’s why he hasn’t sent thousands more people to El Salvador, to cite one clear example.  But even if he did completely ignore judges rulings on election fraud, blowing the whistle would still matter: it would damage his legitimacy as a leader.  Trump is trying to go after ActBlue now, but it does not mean he will succeed. The purpose is to make it more difficult to fund democratic candidates. Even if he succeeds, it does not mean that it will be impossible to fund democratic candidates.
