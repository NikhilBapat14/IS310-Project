"My dad and brother think everything on Fox News is true even when I provide direct contradictory quotes and other evidence that shows they're full of shit. They're just angry people that watch Fox because of some random, baseless hatred of the government and liberals which only further fuels their anger. It's sad and pathetic. The timing is wrong, but it's almost like George Lucas came up with the dark side of the force to explain Fox News viewers. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.",Ahleron,2025-04-25T09:58:57,37
"There really is no communicating with these people. Even if you point out a lie: ‚ÄúI will end the war in Ukraine the first day after I am elected!‚Äù That‚Äôs a lie: saying you will do something and then not doing it is a lie. And then they get defensive, of both them and Him (Jesus in their minds), and twist words. You could tell them ‚Äúhe said egg prices are down ~90%‚Äù, and they‚Äôre not: a lie. But they will never, ever respond to that in a direct, intellectually honest way. It‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs a cult.",dinosaurinchinastore,2025-04-25T10:55:42,18

"Fox News created the toxic Republican Party, that then made Trump.  Not sure what the solution is, but we can‚Äôt start fixing this country until we acknowledge that Fox News is one of the biggest problems we face.  Even neo-fascists can win elections when they have a party-run propaganda network brainwashing half the population.  No one that works at Fox (or its ilk) should ever be considered a journalist, or treated like a journalist. That‚Äôs at least a start.",Timothy303,2025-04-25T11:36:09,14
That might depend. They do have some actual news. Most of it is opinion shows though and that‚Äôs (according to Tucker Carlson‚Äôs lawyers) just entertainment and can‚Äôt be taken seriously.,ConiferousTurtle,2025-04-25T09:52:53,12

"The problem with Fox News is that the entire network channel is called Fox ""News"" and yet the majority of it is opinion. They do have an actual news program on their channel and Trump hates that one because Trump hates the truth.  And Truth Social should be called Conservative Opinion Social.  When I became disillusioned of religion I realized that words like truth and perfection are nothing more than the flawed opinions of humankind.",Faithlessblakkcvlt,2025-04-25T11:21:49,5

A lot of families have suffered over the last few decades because parents or grandparents plop down in their angry chair after work (if they work) or just sit there all day long watching the hate propaganda and getting put into a constant rage. People who have never been to a major city are furious about the gun crime in Chicago. People who don't know a single minority or trans person are convinced that they're destroying the entire country. People who are living the same basic life in the same house they grew up in are convinced that their way of life is being destroyed (by the city folk/immigrants/LGBT/whatever people).,wknight8111,2025-04-25T13:14:29,3

My parents in their 60‚Äôs believe everything Fox News tells them. If I introduce facts it only strengthens their views. Having productive conversations with them are pointless. The only remedy I can see is to bring back the Fairness Doctrine and apply it to News and Entertainment outlets. Since you know legally speaking Fox News is entertainment.,Joshhwwaaaaaa,2025-04-26T03:43:44,2

"Don‚Äôt you wish someone would start a channel called VOX NEWS that looks exactly like Fox, but runs real stories?Like, dizzy-looking blondes could read them and everything. All red white and blue. All ads for American stuff.   The main story would be BREAKING NEWS: TRUMP IMPERSONATOR HAS BEEN RUNNING AMERICA. Then follow this with actual news of all the awful things the ‚Äúimpersonator‚Äù has been doing, how he tricked us all and how to stop him! (The real Trump, sadly, died of happiness at the news of his first election).  You‚Äôd turn on VOX at a relative‚Äôs house, put FOX on parental lock and let it ride. (‚ÄúNo, grandpa, it was always Vox. You must have misheard and let‚Äôs get you some new glasses.‚Äù)   Your relatives would slowly be spun back to something more approximate to reality.",evasandor,2025-04-26T13:18:53,1
Im sorry but at what point do you try to sit down and explain to these people they are being brainwashed. Me being black and in a blue state and lgbt i dont think i would run into family members or people in my circle being Maga or completely Fox coded but if i did Id think at some point id be concerned. This shit is toxic.  Too many people are okay with never correcting their racist homophobic etc.. family member. If you sit and let them continue then imo youre not helping,AggressiveRuin4147,2025-04-25T17:51:39,1

"hmm.. you're right that I was overly focused on the ""day one"" thing, but did he actually say ""the day after I am elected?""
