"Modern conservatism insists that 15 year olds are too stupid and immature to make medical decisions on their own behalf and obtain an abortion, but totally grown up and mature enough that once pregnancy runs its full course, will be wise and mature enough to make medical decisions on behalf of a newborn baby.   We can’t allow gender affirming care for minors because it might cause irreversible damage to their fragile developing child bodies and brains, but locking them in a jail cell with adults for crimes committed using those fragile developing child bodies and brains can only benefit them physically, socially, and emotionally. Of course.  Too young and dumb to know whether they’re actually gay, totally old enough to be married and hold a full time job.",EggsAndMilquetoast,2025-05-08T14:38:43,23
">Amnisty Freelen's son, Joshua Beasley, Jr., was 11 when he first entered the juvenile system for spray painting a Paris, Texas church with other boys.  >A month after he turned 16, he was transferred to the Wayne Scott Unit adult prison.  >Six months later, in March 2023, he wrapped a sheet around his neck and died in his cell.  >""In the adult system, Josh is the youngest person to die,"" Freelen said.  There's already enough wrong with the prison system. Lowering the age by one year will only make it worse.",AudibleNod,2025-05-08T14:15:59,27

Anyone who still lives in Texas needs to acknowledge that your government actively does not give two fucks about your lives or dreams and indeed seems eager to weaponize against all of you.,KenUsimi,2025-05-08T22:12:15,2
"They want to disappear, traumatize, and screw over minors who don't know their rights by giving them a criminal record early in their life, making it harder for them if and when they get released.  Thanks GOP, you're *REALLY* making the decision to vote easy by investing into being the worst you've ever been.",exophrine,2025-05-09T00:50:51,2
