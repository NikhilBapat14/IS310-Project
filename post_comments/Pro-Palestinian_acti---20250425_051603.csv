"No arrests were made, and there is presumably nothing beyond these students' active participation in on-campus protests to suggest that they were involved in vandalism.  ""The raids appear to have taken place under the direction of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has repeatedly targeted students and activists supporting Palestinian rights, including egregiously choosing to bring felony charges against students and protesters last year.""",raggamuffin1357,2025-04-25T05:21:29,19

"A Michigan investigation into a series of vandalism incidents has led to the raid of several homes belonging to pro-Palestinian activists. The probe, which focuses on damage worth around $100,000, is part of a broader investigation into recent acts of vandalism. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel confirmed that law enforcement agencies executed the raids, targeting individuals believed to be involved in the property damage. These events come amid heightened tensions over the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The investigation remains active, and further details are expected to emerge as authorities continue their work.",Complete-Buy-8174,2025-04-25T05:19:31,1
This certainly isn't disturbing at all! /s  Edit: The Trump administration has been salivating over finding excuses to crack down on pro Palestinian protests.  Searching their homes is not necessary in this matter.,Kroptokinsloaf,2025-04-25T06:25:58,1
