">The details: GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with Democrats to in favor of the resolution, which failed in a 49-49 vote.  [...]  >Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) did not vote. His office said in a statement that he has ""been consistent in opposing tariffs and that a trade war is not in the best interest of American households and businesses.""  Spineless bastard.  And also:  >Democrats' efforts to pass the measure were hindered by the absence of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) , who was returning to the U.S. from South Korea.  What on earth was so important for a single US Senator to be in South Korea that it's worth tanking the economy over?

"It’s the new new green deal. Trump will single-handedly reduce Americans’ carbon footprint. The decrease in emissions from shipping and trucking alone will have a huge impact!   Seriously.   Also, if the positive ecological impact of his tariff policy become widely known, if environmentalists shout about the benefits? If it becomes labeled as “green”? GOP senators will flee from it. ",appleandorangutan,2025-04-30T21:19:10,1
"How convenient that that one Dem didn’t show up to vote! The two party facade is going to shambles quicker than they hoped it would and there is no more denying the fact that neither party gives a flying fuck about ANY OF US. The Dem not showing up to vote is by design. Keep the status quo going by all means. Maybe more libs, who laughably call themselves leftists, will wake tf up now and stop hoping that the Democratic Party will save them. Both parties solely work for their corporate overlords. Point. Blank. Period. All we have is each other at this point. It’s beyond time for the brainwashed libs and conservatives to deprogram themselves of hating each other when we should be hating our do-nothing politicians and the billionaires who tell them what to do. All of the intentional pinning against each other the GOP and the Dems have sowed upon us to keep us too busy hating each other to distract us and keep us from hating them, The TRUE villains. This needs to stop NOW. All of us have way more in common than y’all would like to think we do. There are more of us than there are them.
