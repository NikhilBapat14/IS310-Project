"It’s trump’s budget proposal. Bet it gets changed significantly, although maybe it’s more hope it’s changed.",Woody_CTA102,2025-05-02T23:21:24,22
That shit is so trash even republicans have already called it out,FickleSystem,2025-05-02T23:40:21,23
Great.  I am not alone in having stage IV ovarian cancer and my survival depends on science finding better treatments or I die  How many people including children have to die because he cut funding for cancer research or other terminal or chronic conditions?  And that is just one aspect of the kind of suffering this will cause   I am not religious but that man acts like the anti christ,500CatsTypingStuff,2025-05-03T04:31:05,17
"Is it okay to quote a Republican on this?  ""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual-is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.  Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.  In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.  Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been over shadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.  The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.  Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.  It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.""",Proper-Landscape-226,2025-05-02T23:15:58,12
This is all to give enormous tax breaks to the already filthy rich.   We need to supercharge this in our messaging. Don't let Trump distract you with his 300 ring circus.,clamorous_owle,2025-05-03T00:18:44,8

USFS here. The cuts are part of his plan to exploit our public lands for privatization. Our research division is being cut 97% with more cuts to other agencies like NOAA and EPA.

"What's trash is that there is no emergency, and this potus is overstepping.  This is what the GOP should be out raged about. But they aren't, which means they are in on the grift (just the ones in office and who have monetized this situation).  GOP sold itself out, and the American people with it.",joylightribbon,2025-05-03T17:11:11,2

"Normally I would be on board.  However, I donated to a lot of causes in the last cycle which resulted in pure torture.  I get at least 5 texts a day from blue causes asking for $.  My mental health has eroded from the endless text bombs such that I hate my party too and dont care if the whole country goes up in flames.  You could argue that I should chance my phone number but that causes a huge number of issues and I feel they would figure it out somehow and continue with what is mental torture (and, I should not have to).        I am out - I am finally in a financial picture that I can contribute significantly and I will never spend another penny until it is linked to personal safety from the blue mafia  lifelong democrat who has lost his sh\*t",deceipt_river,2025-05-03T15:46:26,1
