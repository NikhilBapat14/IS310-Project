"Wow so many gang members, criminals and rapists but the only strange this is they look like kids, farmers, grandparents and people driving 55 in a 54",katiescasey,2025-05-08T17:07:05,17
"1. Trump uses dehumanizing rhetoric like ""animals"" and ""vermin"" and ""they're poisoning our blood."" He says he didn't know Hitler used that same rhetoric first, so give him credit for coming up with it on his own, as if *thinking along the same lines as Hitler* is better than quoting Hitler.   2. Trump tells straight-up lies, saying they're ""eating the pets"" and exaggerating crime statistics. Conservative media doesn't fact check any of it.  2. Conservative media frames everything in terms of ""they're criminals"" never mentioning that illegal border crossing is a minor misdemeanor with the same penalty as mountain biking on a federal trail, or that if they entered as a tourist it's not even a crime, or that if they've applied for asylum then entering the country illegally is waived.   And all of this serves to train the magas to be okay with, or even to celebrate, abject cruelty toward the targets of that rhetoric. It trains them to be okay with the targets of that rhetoric being due process. It trains them to be okay with the targets of that rhetoric being denied basic human rights.    It's one thing to read about how things developed at other times in other countries that parallel all of the above, and quite another to be watching it happen from the inside, to my own country.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-08T17:11:10,10
The Supreme court should stop all court proceedings immediately and hold the executive branch in contempt of there ruling to return American citizen Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the united states.   The fact that the Trump administration just ignored them is completely insane.   We should arrest Trump using the marshal service immediately for ignoring a court order.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-08T17:27:13,5

What the moron is doing is reversing everything he can that Biden accomplished because he knows that he will accomplish nothing but horror in his 4 year tenure.,Senior-bud,2025-05-08T19:11:25,1
