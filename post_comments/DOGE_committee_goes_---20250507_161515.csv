I regularly fence with 9 year olds, and 70 year olds. There's always something to learn from everyone because it's mostly a technique and strategy based sport. If we were to segregate practices by gender then women would be negatively impacted. There are far fewer women athletes in the sport and they would have far fewer people to practice against.  As was noted in the hearing, a plurality of competitions are coed because otherwise women wouldn't have enough competitions to compete and get ratings in. In my region women only tournaments are really hard to find due to lack of competitors. I wish that wasn't the case, and I'm proud of the USA Fencing board for making recruiting more women to the sport a huge priority.

"Based on how many people put incredible effort into cheating and still fail the exam, people like this don't put much effort into evaluating the efficiency of their efforts.   Arguably the bigger problem with corruption isn't that politicians make money they weren't supposed to.  It's that they make *decisions* for the rest of us that they otherwise wouldn't, because they *believe* they are getting something in return.  What they receive doesn't have to have *any* actual value as long as they believe they owe someone for it.  ",robot65536,2025-05-07T18:19:36,52

"“They rigged the match because of DEI!”  It is so crazy how DEI has just become “they’re black”.  Like you can have an overly qualified person and the moment a republican sees they’re black, it’s DEI.

"Baltimores mayor, they accused a person elected in a district with a large black population. DEI is just their new branding for Affirmative Action, which was recently changed to DEI because CRT lost momentum. They moved onto ‘Woke’ to bastardize the original meaning. Which has worked wonders, because everyone will throw out woke while never truly understanding the original meaning. This is an example of how effective the right is at messaging regardless of meaning.",Effective_Course_436,2025-05-08T11:56:54,4
