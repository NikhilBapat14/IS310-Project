If the tariffs aren't sustainable why did Maga start a global trade war? And who's side is Maga on in this war? They're not on the side of working Americans.,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-24T08:57:15,9

China says nothings happening. Trump says deals are being made. But Trump and his cronies are admitting this situation is not sustainable. Trump NEEDS tariffs so wealthy people don't have to pay taxes and keep getting the wealthy man's welfare. Such a conundrum.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-24T08:58:24,5

"> If the tariffs aren't sustainable why did Maga start a global trade war?  Because Republicans thought they could just say tariff and and other countries would just do what they are told.  ""Not sustainable"" translates to ""countries did not do what we told them to do"". It order for demands to be sustained the other countries have to give in to the demands.

""If you get mugged and put money in their hands, they will come back to mug us.""  >Oguma called Trump's tariff formula ""a mess"" and questioned if it was ""safe for a serious person to go there"" and negotiate with the U.S.  >""Consider every option, but you should never make concessions to someone who is not straight up anyway,"" Oguma said, adding: ""I hope that you will never give in to the American extortionists. I know this is harsh to say, but they are extortionists.""  >""If you listen to what they say, it will be a really bad example,"" Oguma said.  >Iwaya meanwhile has called for a diplomatic approach to the still-developing U.S. trade policy, comparing the regular changes to ""a daily menu.""

I like where you head is at. Maybe at some not Republican rallies or events instead of the crowd booing Trump the crowd just starts making chicken noises. Get it on vid and get it going viral. It will make its way back to Trump. Yes... Ba Kah !,tech57,2025-04-24T12:05:37,1
