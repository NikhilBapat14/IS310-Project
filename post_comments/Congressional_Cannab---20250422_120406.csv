"From the story:  Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair Dave Joyce introduced legislation last week that would remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances and allow states to set their own policies on its use.  Noting that nearly all 50 states permit some use of cannabis or cannabis-based products, the South Russell Republican said the existing policy has caused unnecessary harm and wasted tax dollars by diverting law enforcement resources from “violent crimes to making needless arrests and facilitating incarcerations for small possessions of state legal marijuana.”  He said his [STATES 2.0 Act](https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/joyce.house.gov/uploads/2025/04/JOYCOH_017_xml.pdf), introduced with Bay Village GOP Rep. Max Miller and his Democratic Cannabis Caucus co-chair, Dina Titus of Nevada, would “create a more logical approach to cannabis regulation that allows each state to put the policies in place that work best for their communities and unique needs.”     You can read more through the link in the OP -- no payment information required.",clevelanddotcom,2025-04-22T12:06:31,7
