"Because there's no mechanism to do so. When the country was founded it was imagined as a bunch of ostensibly independent entities (states) uniting under a common federal government to pool resources, make the united country more formidable internationally, etc. Under that mindset, changing state borders would entail violating the independence of these separate states.",[deleted],2022-09-29T08:14:50,9
"I mean, this is pretty obviously a question to make a point, not a real question. Of course we can't just redraw states every so often. That's now how this country has ever worked. It doesn't make a lot of sense practically or historically. There are actual major issues with redrawing state lines as states have different laws, unlike districts. But I'm sure you get all that. The point here was to say that redistricting is stupid.  And to a certain extent, you're right. But that's going to happen in a system with SMDP voting. The way most systems have solved this is by uncapping the legislature or by doing away with SMDP. If we're going to talk reform, let's talk real, good reform. Not just invent silly situations just to make a point.",mormagils,2022-09-29T09:11:09,7
"Because states are semi-sovereign entities co-equal in power to the federal government, it can't just redraw their lines at will.  We are not a unitary government, we are a federation of sovereign States, it's right in the name. It would be like asking why the European Union can't just redraw country's borders.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-09-29T09:47:55,3
"Because they serve fundamentally different purposes. A U.S. state is a sovereign political entity with its own set of laws and its own government. A congressional district is a subdivision of a state that exists solely to provide representation in Congress.  If you get re-drawn into a new congressional district, your life does not change. You still get to vote for exactly one member of Congress, and you're still subject to the same state and federal laws.   If you were to be re-drawn into a new state, then suddenly you're living under different laws, regulations, tax systems, etc. Imagine if you owned a cannabis farm in a legal state, and then you get re-drawn into a state where cannabis is illegal. Or what if you get re-drawn from Washington (a state with no income tax) to Oregon. All of a sudden, you have to pay income tax to a state that you didn't choose to live in and a government that you had no say in electing.  You might as well not even call them ""states"" at that point. A state derives its power from the consent of the governed. If people are getting arbitrarily forced into different states, then the consent doesn't exist anymore.",[deleted],2022-09-30T13:22:45,2
"There's no way and no need to do so. I'm not sure what purpose redrawing states lines would serve, but it wasn't included in the original programming.",HTC864,2022-09-29T08:30:16,2

"I’m asking, if there is an argument that redistricting is good then why doesn’t that argument also apply to states?  If states were/are imagined as independent entities uniting under a common federal government to pool resources, etc. then why wasn’t/isn’t that same logic applied to more local districts being independent entities uniting under a common state government to pool resources, etc.?",Dear-You5548,2022-09-29T11:32:58,1
"Don’t districts often encompass many different local governments that have different laws?  I understand that’s not how it worked historically, and obliviously that’s not how it works now, but that wasn’t my question, I’m asking people who believe redistricting is a good thing for why their argument doesn’t also apply to state lines.",Dear-You5548,2022-09-29T11:38:39,-1

"At the time of the Revolution, the states were independent entities with no linkage between them beneath the level of British rule. Counties/municipalities were not. So it would be natural to treat them in that way.  You might as well ask why they don't draw European boundaries given the existence of the EU. Should we break up France and Germany while creating a single 'Benelux' nation?",ViskerRatio,2022-09-30T09:54:32,5
"Local governments don't have different laws, really. They are only very minor things, like zoning ordinances and minor stuff like that. Local ""laws"" can't be different on major issues like taxation, crime, public funding, etc. That's a pretty obvious significant difference.  I also don't think anyone believes redistricting is ""good."" It's just a necessary thing in a SMDP system with a capped legislature. No one is saying they WANT redistricting as a feature of our system. They're saying that it comes with the other stuff we do want, like a capped legislature with single member districts elected via plurality voting.",mormagils,2022-09-29T14:09:11,3
"Because again this isn't a unitary nation. There's nothing imagined about it, states are independent pre-existing sovereign entities who surrendered portions of their sovereignty to create the federal government. They still retain most of their sovereignty and powers not expressly given to the federal government in the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people through the 10th amendment.  Districts are simple lines on paper and do not have any power as they are not political entities like counties, municipalities, and even school districts all of which's power is derived from the state's sovereignty and is granted to them through its state constitution.  So again as districts are not a political entity but simply a geographic division, like postal zip codes or telephone area codes, used to help with the logistics of voting, there is no uniting or pooling resources.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-09-29T12:28:26,3
"You're asking to prove an argument that wasn't made, and to tell you why a comparison *you thought up* doesn't work. If you have a point you're trying to make, it'd be faster to simply state it.",HTC864,2022-09-29T11:42:20,4

"The quote I provided is from the ACLU and the fact that the United States still has this system means that are at least some supporters of the status quo. I would like those people to back up their argument.

"You could equally apply that 'arbitrary' judgement to national boundaries. However, the application of fixed political boundaries over time creates real differences. The laws in different states are different while the laws in different Congressional districts within the same state generally aren't.  You might also consider how arbitrary it is to allocate Congressional representation based on population. The goal of a legislature is to represent a spectrum of interests across a society, not to simply count noses. Division by population doesn't really accomplish this goal particularly well.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-02T04:40:47,6
