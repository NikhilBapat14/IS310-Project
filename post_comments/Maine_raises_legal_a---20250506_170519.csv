"Fact: The U.S. is the ONLY UN member state that has NOT ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Regardless of US non-ratification, it is international law. Even Afghanistan, often criticized by the US for its lack of human rights for women (and rightly so), has FAR stricter laws than many US states.   The reason becomes clear when you consider that between 2000 and 2018, some 300,000 minors were married in the United States.  The vast majority of child marriages (reliable sources vary between 78% and 95%) were between a minor girl and an adult man.   Furthering complications, young girls bodies often are undeveloped sufficiently to bear children. Combined with harsh US laws against abortion, this is resulting in a spike in maternal mortality rates for minors. Let that last sentence sink in.    Furthermore, In most states, minors cannot legally divorce or leave their spouse, and domestic violence shelters do not accept minors.  This is state sanctioned sexual assault of minors, and an affront to human rights and basic human dignity, particularly for young girls, and is quite literally a situation that is unique to the USA.  Land of the free to sexually assault young girls, and force them die horribly from pregnancy complications. Stay free America! üá∫üá∏",Random-Name-7160,2025-05-07T16:09:07,1

"Health insurance, is one. If a 16/17yo gets pregnant by an 18yo and that 18yo has coverage that can help with better prenatal care, that would be a reason to rush the marriage and might be the difference between life and death if there are complications.   Remember: ""no age limit"" doesn't ALWAYS mean that it between an adult and a minor. It can be between two teenagers of a similar age. You may or may not find it acceptable but there are couples under 18 who are married and happy. a ban would dissolve their marriage and cause distress.   Another exception are religious/cultural asylum. If a minor is subject to a forced marriage abroad and has fled, legally marrying someone her own age in the US might keep her here legally, safe, and in a better situation overall.   Another exception is guaranteed escape from abusive households... where the marriage partner is protective, not coercive.   NOTE: I AM STILL AGAINST THE IDEA... But these are the reasons.",KnightDuty,2025-05-07T23:43:05,1
"I want you to first understand that I‚Äôm not trying to attack you here. These are the first things that come to most people‚Äôs mind when they weigh both sides of this issue. I believe thinking critically about this issue leads to a deeper understanding of its importance, so I‚Äôm not unhappy to be having this discussion. What I merely hope to do is show that the mission of setting the marriage age in line with the age of majority around the world is a good and just cause that should be supported by everyone and that there is truly and absolutely no reason to allow exceptions.  The first important thing to understand is how there is no foolproof way to weed out the cases where the marriage is consensual and the cases where the marriage is forced.   Parental consent does not help because parents almost always play a crucial role in facilitating a forced marriage and that consent can very often be coercion.  Some states have a judicial approval system in place. These vary wildly from judges who never even see the minor and just need to sign off on the fact that the parent consents to a full scale hearing where the minor is represented by a guardian ad litem and is required to have an in-camera interview with the judge where they swear on record that the marriage is consensual. The problem is, no matter how robust the judicial approval system, there is always the possibility that the minor will lie. When a minor is forced to marry, they are also forced to lie to the judge about it.   Lastly, minors don‚Äôt have the same rights as an adult facing a forced marriage. In most states they can‚Äôt leave home, enter a domestic violence shelter, hire a lawyer or independently bring a legal action like filing a protective order against parents forcing them to marry. Even if the minor is emancipated, their rights are only limited and may not cover everything listed above, including access to a DV shelter.  These rights also make it very difficult for an already married minor to leave a consensual marriage that becomes abusive. In some states, minors can‚Äôt even file for divorce.  Also, your statement that a blanket ban on child marriage would dissolve marriages that already occurred is false. In each of the 14 states that have ended child marriage, the legislation is prospective and only applies to marriages that have yet to occur. They don‚Äôt dissolve the marriages of two people in their 80s who married at 17 and 18 decades ago. No advocates working in this space would draft or support legislation that dissolves existing marriages. All this legislation does is eliminate the existing loopholes that allow a minor to be issued a marriage license.  With that, let‚Äôs turn to your examples of when a marriage could be beneficial to a minor.  Health insurance - First of all, for a number of reasons, a pregnant teen needs more protection from an underage marriage than a teen who isn‚Äôt pregnant. One of the most common reasons that a minor (in the US at least) is forced to marry is because of a pregnancy. If for some reason, that teen cannot get health insurance from her parents, there are systems in place like Medicaid that she can get coverage through. Post delivery, states make it rather easy to establish paternity outside of wedlock. Sometimes it just a form the father needs to fill out. Then all of his insurance and other benefits extend to his child.  Asylum - If a minor was already legally married abroad, any marriage they entered into upon arriving in the US would be void due to polygamy laws. Our immigration system is pretty broken, but asylees do not need to get married to retain their asylee status. Green card marriages create a pathway towards permanent residency, but a minor would never be expected to enter into a marriage to retain their asylee status. If they want to enter into a green card marriage when they turn 18, they can certainly do that.  Abusive parents - As I mentioned above, parents almost always play a crucial role in facilitating a forced marriage. Nearly every state requires parental consent for a minor to marry. I find it hard to believe there would be parents who are routinely abusing their child, but would also consent to their marriage so the minor can escape their abuse. Further, studies show that minors who marry are more likely to experience domestic violence and, as I mentioned above, that minor faces really difficult legal and practical barriers if they want to leave that marriage. This really becomes an out of the frying pan and into the fire kind of situation. A minor‚Äôs temporary hardship should not be used to set them up for a lifetime of hardships. Besides the higher rates of domestic violence, minors who marry are more likely to experience a myriad of physical and mental disorders, they‚Äôre more likely to drop out of school, and they‚Äôre more likely to experience economic hardship and instability. The solution to a minor in an abusive household is Child Protective Services, not marrying her off.  I hope this all makes sense. I‚Äôm happy to provide sources for anything I said or answer any other questions.",beccaface,2025-05-08T06:47:24,1
"I'm against it too, btw. That's my core belief is that therr should be a strict 18yo law because think there is net harm that can't be ignored due to edge cases.   However i feel you are being intellectual dishonest by choosing to frame every case as if there are never ANY case exceptions. By intentionally framing it as if no exceptions ever could exist ever... you make it incredible difficult for people to believe you and you do harm to the cause.   For instance when I said somebody fled due to an arranged marriage, you framed it as if the marriage had already taken place making a new marriage void. Because you didn't entertain the fact that they could have fled before the marriage, you went ahead and dismissed THE ENTIRE POINT.   To people encountering these arguments for the very first time, waving away EVERY EDGE CASE makes you look like you have a pre-determined agenda and puts them on the defense regarding your stance.   an intellectually honest way to handle this would be to acknowledge the edge-cases and then present the broader case that they don't make up for the bigger picture. Going through the counterpoints one by one and finding ways in which they're invalid makes you look like a zealot when anybody can just google the statements put out by the ACLU etc.",KnightDuty,2025-05-08T07:17:27,1
"I disagree that I‚Äôm being intellectually dishonest. I truly honestly feel that there should never be any exceptions to a child marriage ban. If there is a situation where a marriage before 18 seems like a viable solution, I hope my explanations showed that there is always another path. And that there is really no harm that comes from waiting until 18 for a minor who is in love and marrying for all the right reasons.  I also disagree that I dismissed your entire point regarding asylum status. Like I said, a marriage is not necessary to retain asylee status, especially for a minor where marriage is not legal in 28% of the country.  I do have an agenda. My agenda is to dispel the harmful notion that there are a few edge cases where marriage before 18 could be necessary. I‚Äôm not saying a marriage before 18 can‚Äôt be happy or healthy. I am saying it is never necessary. I don‚Äôt want people to conjure up a hypothetical of some poor girl in a desperate situation who can only find salvation in the arms of a good man. I want people to open their minds to all the possible solutions to difficult problems instead of saying ‚ÄúWell, marry her off. That might help.‚Äù  Also the ACLU almost never plays a role in getting these bills passed and they have actually been the main reason that the bills failed in California and Illinois.",beccaface,2025-05-08T07:31:21,1
"I apologize for using the phrase ""intellectually dishonest"" it was too blunt, not what I meant, and I said it out of frustration and instinct for debate. That ""it's not the ONLY way"" wasn't clear to me as your stance/framing.      Here's what's happening here stripped bare: I do persuasion messaging for a living. I'm reading what you're writing, and I'm cringing a little because I project your stance as having the opposite effect.  People on the fence are likely to look at your responses and think ""reading that looks like a lot of work."" Then they're going to choose to skim it or skip to the next person's response. (My belief is this is how MOST uninvested people treat this)  This isn't a problem when you've anticipated somebody skimming instead of reading. It means you can structure things in a way that skimmers still maintain information. You can lean on bolding, H1/H2s, captions, structural breaks, etc. However Reddit doesn't allow any of that.  So I'm not trying to butt heads with you. I'm just professionally frustrated. From where I'm standing these points are indistinguishible from rigid morality. They'll only get nods from people who are already inclined to agree.  I understand that ""people who already agree"" might be your primary audience. Perhaps you want to arm them or 'activate' them. Regardless I'm quite literally trained to look for the ripple effects.  I'm not 'right' on any of this. I'm just trying to add something. I personally think your position would be stronger with adjusted framing that gives a token pat on the head for the edge cases before saying a consice ""but those edge cases are already handled through alternate means so there is no reason.""
