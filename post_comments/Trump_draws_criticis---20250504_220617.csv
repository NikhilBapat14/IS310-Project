Ignore his attempted distraction from the Trumpcession caused by the Trump tariffs... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-04T22:34:50,8
"Trump is vile, disrespectful, and scum of the Earth!",dokikod,2025-05-04T22:45:02,6
"Hell, I know some catholic Trump supporters who aren’t happy about it. I’ve seen reactions on conservative subreddits too and they’re not thrilled either. At worst they believe he’s unnecessarily taking the piss and trolling the libs and at worst they think it’s insulting to their religion. Would any of them regret voting for him because of it? Doubtful, but I hope some start opening their eyes a bit.",BiscutWithGrapeJahm,2025-05-04T23:05:28,5

"Nah, it'll blow over just like the Gaza video Trump put out they've already forgotten they were annoyed about. They'll clutch their pearls for however long it makes them feel like they have any morals then go right back to kissing his ass.",LurksAroundHere,2025-05-05T00:23:03,6
