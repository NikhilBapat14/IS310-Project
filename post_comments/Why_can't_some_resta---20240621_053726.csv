Whats the difference in an $18 vs $20 sandwich to you  * Or maybe its $19 vs $20  * Or $19.50 vs $20  Some business maximize there space so that it is already competitive and some have massive amounts of Ambiance space as a selling point   Do both deserve to have rent subsidized?,semideclared,2024-06-21T11:45:14,3
"That's not a solution to high food prices, all it does is change who's paying those prices, shifting the burden to whoever's subsidizing the rent.  Most basements aren't built to handle being a commercial kitchen, it requires a lot more than a regular kitchen.    There may be room for relaxing some regulations, but others do have important purposes and it seems more like glossing over those issues and assuming it'd just be a big win for everyone.",zlefin_actual,2024-06-21T14:47:24,3
"In many places the business owners adopt the philosophy of charging what the market will pay rather than the actual value, maximizing their profits. If they had the foot traffic and name value, they'd probably charge $50. If you've ever eaten at the movie theater or been to Disney World you see this in action, and it kinda sucks for those who are just getting by.",amytyl,2024-06-21T12:48:05,6
"I think I could be persuaded to support something like this for grocery stores, especially if it were deployed in such a way as to counteract the tendency of poor neighborhoods turning into food deserts.  Restaurants I am less open to subsidizing simply because they can be considered a luxury to an extent.  I understand that for people living in food deserts, cheap fast food may be their only option, but imo it would be better to give them better options, like subsidized grocery stores, than make the bad options they currently have cheaper.",Calladit,2024-06-23T17:51:01,1
"I think we just have other ways of subsidizing food. Granted, those ways suck... SNAP and WIC don't really give people a lot of choices, and you have to be so poor you have almost nothing. Which puts people who can't get those benefits but can't afford good food in a spot where they get unhealthier and unhealthier.  The other reality is, prepared food is a business. We don't give businesses a break like that.",VoteSwappingUSA,2024-06-27T18:08:58,1
"I think their point is a sandwich should really be, like $3.00. Because even at that price point they're making a profit when they have no overhead.",BubblelusciousUT,2024-06-21T12:09:29,0
"Someone doesnt understand the restaurant business AT ALL. 23% food cost, 30% labor, 5% operating supplies, 25% rent, 10% other overhead (utilities, insurance, accounting, legal, etc) 7% profit if you are lucky.",LiberalAspergers,2024-06-21T15:35:52,7
"I think generalizations  keep things at status quo. The important point you bring up is that restaurants have a lot of financial pressures from everywhere to juggle; and the net result is \_something\_ is going to be impacted:  The problem with modernity is not just that a sandwich can cost 20$, it's that the customer has to choose between a set of bad options, not necessarily always high price. Some vendors can choose to compromise on portion size, ingredient quality, less parking or cleanliness, or just charge more because it's a high-income / high traffic area with not many competitors.  If the base costs are high the restaurant also has no incentive to offer any ""deals"", for example a  bowl of rice for 2.50$. Even though rice can bring in enough margin, they need still need to upsell you to take care of all their other costs, such as charging 3$ for a fountain soda.  We end in a weird situation where if someone wants to eat at restaurants for 3 meals a day, they are gonna pay 80$-100$/day for what amounts to 20$-40$ worth of food.  While it makes ""sense"" for people to pay 25$ for a lunch every now and again to compensate all the middlemen and overhead, and convenience of their staff being available at the moment you decide you're hungry, it scales really badly for the end customer.  As a customer, I don't want to be paying for a fixed cost of building rent in a variable, per meal format. I like paying for convenience, but it seems in the food service industry there's no mechanism for scaling quality food at a decent price.  The other issue is of course sales tax, basic groceries are tax-free but most restaurants are taxed 10-15% in Canada. Again another ""convenience cost"" that scales badly.  I'm not suggesting the government steps in to solve all our problems by offering free rent to restaurants, but some point we need to stop finding excuses to justify a 7$ item costing 25$ even for repeat customers.",clon3man,2024-06-22T13:58:06,1
"Obviously, those numbers I quoted arent exact for qll restaurants, but they are pretty close for most. Food cost is generally between 25 and 30% of total revenue, so the customer should expect to pay about 4 times what it cost to buy the ingredients. Obviously, there is some slip, where are restaurant has 1000% markup on drinks, and only 100% on a sandwich.",LiberalAspergers,2024-06-22T14:43:55,3
