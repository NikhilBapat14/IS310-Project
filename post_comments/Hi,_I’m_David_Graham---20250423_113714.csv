"The Trump regime seems to be a very loose coalition with the overall shared agenda of dismantling the federal government—but for very different reasons. I don’t imagine most of the tech oligarchs are on board with the more explicitly Christo-fascist elements of Project 2025, for example. How do you think about the conflicting interests that unite this coalition? And is there a point at which you think that coalition will begin to splinter as a result of different agendas?

"The most important area where I haven’t seen a lot of action yet is around banning or restricting abortion. Trump seemed to view overturning *Roe* as a good political tool, but he seems less excited about next steps that Project 2025’s authors want: a national ban on abortion or, failing that, withdrawing approval for medical-abortion drugs, barring the mailing of those drugs, and surveilling state abortion stats.  I also haven’t seen much action along the efforts to improve life for American workers, something that Project 2025 lays out a series of steps to achieve.  Some of the most intriguing parts of Project 2025 for me are the ones where the authors are at odds with Trump. For example, they’re much more hawkish on Russia and supportive of Ukraine. There’s also a debate inside the text over tariffs, between a free-market writer and Peter Navarro, who is now in the White House—but even there, Navarro calls for a much more limited tariff program than what Trump has pursued.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T12:34:44,42

"I think the Tracker is really good as far as it goes, but it’s a little tough to quantify all of Project 2025. What I see as the project’s central goal—“Restore the family as the center-piece of American life and protect our children”—is very abstract, and it’s hard to know what it would look like to achieve that. “Dismantle the administrative state,” the No. 2 goal—that’s a little easier to grasp, but I’m still not sure how to measure that. And the Tracker’s structure makes it hard to compare reality directly with Project 2025. For example, it says that six of six goals on USAID have been achieved, which is sort of true insofar as the administration is trying to effectively eliminate it—but Project 2025 doesn’t call for elimination. Still, it’s the best resource I’ve seen for looking at individual goals.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T12:30:09,15
"Trump has been able to win in part because people just don’t believe government works. DOGE is a very cynical exercise—it’s plainly not actually interested in efficiency—but it’s capitalizing on a widespread impression. Rebuilding a stronger, more effective federal government is going to require people buying in and wanting to fix it, rather than getting more alienated. Now that my book is out, I’m curious to read Ezra Klein and my colleague Derek Thompson’s new book, *Abundance*, [which lays out one vision of how to instill faith in government](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo)—but I haven’t read it yet, so I can’t say where I agree or disagree.

I believe it’s coincidental. Some of the ideas in Project 2025 are very old—some conservatives have been railing against the Fed and the New Deal since they were new—but a lot of the more novel structural ideas here come from the authors’ experience in government and especially in the first Trump administration; they were determined not to encounter the same obstacles the second time around.,theatlantic,2025-04-23T13:18:35,9

"Here’s what I wrote in the book when I tried to sum that up: “It is an avowedly Christian nation, but following a very specific, narrow, and modern strain of Christianity. In many ways, it resembles the 1950s. While fathers work, mothers stay at home with larger families; that’s lucky, since there’s no educational TV for children to watch. At school, they learn old-­fashioned values and lessons. Abortion is illegal, vaccines are voluntary, and the state is minimally involved in healthcare. The government is slow to police racial discrimination in all but its most blatant expressions. Trans and gay people exist—­they always have—­but are encouraged to remain closeted.”",theatlantic,2025-04-23T13:14:37,17
"This is a great question, and I think it’s a smart observation. Project 2025 was published in 2023, before the rapprochement between Trump and Big Tech, so it’s a little more hostile toward the tech industry. More generally, throughout the document, you can see some of MAGA world’s fault lines. To some extent, the goal is to renegotiate and reinstate a version of the bargain that the conservative movement struck in the 1980s and ’90s: Big businesses get deregulation and low taxes; social conservatives get conservative policies on things related to gender and sexuality, women’s rights, abortion, and other so-called culture-war issues. The rise of figures such as J. D. Vance and Josh Hawley means that the specific grounds will change to be at least rhetorically more friendly to workers—though, as I said above, this seems to be limited to rhetoric thus far. But we have seen earlier versions of this coalition splinter, and the fundamental conflicts aren’t going to go away [unless Silicon Valley really finds religion](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/tech-religion-antithetical/682184/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo).",theatlantic,2025-04-23T14:29:48,7
"Not really. Project 2025 has disappeared from conservative media even more than it has from traditional sources, so I haven’t seen great polling recently.

The trick was that few thought that Trump would do these things.

"The ideology at the heart of Project 2025 is very transportable, and the authors also identify ways to force state and local governments to do their will. For example, they want to withhold Justice Department assistance to law-enforcement agencies that don’t assist with their far-reaching version of immigration enforcement, or make some FEMA assistance to states contingent on immigration cooperation. The big systemic focus of Project 2025 is accruing more power for the executive branch, by [laying off or intimidating civil servants](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/doge-civil-servant-purge/681671/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo), converting some of them into political appointees, and seizing control of independent executive-branch agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Election Commission. It’s designed its efforts to strike at the specific structure of the federal government and target specific precedents. In some ways, states are already ahead of this: More and more states are ideologically unified, and many state legislatures are weak, part-time, underpaid bodies, which allows the governor to dominate a state more than a president can dominate the nation.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T14:00:19,11
"I hesitate to make any predictions because, man, I’ve been surprised before. But I don’t see much prospect for the Federal Reserve to be abolished or for the nation to adopt a flat consumption tax anytime soon.

"The biggest reason for everyone to be scared is: No one knows, and there’s no way to know. Americans understandably bristle at how slowly government works sometimes, but many of the things that slow down action are designed to avoid capriciousness. Musk and Project 2025 are trying to remove many of those protections, and it means that the government could do a lot of things with no warning at all. On the specific question, Project 2025’s authors are generally skeptical of public-service loan forgiveness and loan forbearance in general, and they want the government to get out of the student-loan business—though it’s worth remembering that the federal government took it over 15 years ago because predatory lending was costing taxpayers huge amounts of money.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T13:50:53,11
"Let me break this into two parts. First, I think Project 2025 diagnoses some problems well but then offers questionable prescriptions. For example, the authors are right that Congress is badly broken and has abdicated a lot of power to the president; I don’t buy that giving MORE power to the president is a good solution. Similarly, some parts of the federal bureaucracy are sclerotic; simply laying off people en masse and replacing them with people chosen for political loyalty is not going to fix that.  Second, there are a few good ideas. Some of them, such as reforms to the Pentagon budgeting process that lots of experts support, are not very controversial. Others are these interesting areas of left-right agreement: They want to provide doulas to all expectant mothers. They want to guarantee that all workers have a “sabbath,” or at the least are paid time and a half in return for working on Sundays (or Saturdays, for those who observe then). I can imagine the religious term makes some people uncomfortable, but I see that as a very positive idea.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T13:01:12,10
"I see the authors of Project 2025 as true believers. Russell Vought has become willing to embrace some very extreme elements of Trumpism, such as election denial, but he’s been advocating for his vision of government and culture for a long time. The beneficiaries won’t just be the Christian right: Fossil-fuel companies, big business, and the very wealthy will make out very well if Project 2025 is successful, but that doesn’t detract from the sincerity of the agenda. If anything, Trump is a good smoke screen for the people and industries behind Project 2025.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T14:28:17,8

"I do think distinguishing between Project 2025 and the Trump administration is important, because although they overlap, they are not the same. That said, Project 2025 has been a very accurate predictor of policies Trump has pursued, and even some of those not explicitly described in the text are ideologically related. For example: The [deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/trump-constitution-abrego-garcia/682487/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo) and the [attempt to expel Mahmoud Khalil](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-palestinian/682044/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=edit-promo) are not specifically contemplated in Project 2025, but the document does talk about pulling back student visas and deporting people who have legal status. And more broadly, I want to convey that Project 2025 is above all a framework for reshaping the federal government and then American society, rather than simply a collection of policies. That’s one reason this document, unlike the policy wish lists that come out of think tanks on both sides of the aisle every four years, has already been so influential.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T14:01:44,11
"Many of these ideas are a palimpsest of what’s come from the American right for decades: skepticism of the Fed, hatred of the New Deal, opposition to taxes and regulation, a desire to turn back the clock socially. What makes Project 2025 more radical, and important for all Americans to pay attention to, is the way that it seeks to seize power for the president and then use that power to force the rest of American society to conform to its vision.",theatlantic,2025-04-23T14:12:50,7

">Some of the most intriguing parts of Project 2025 for me are the ones where the authors are at odds with Trump. For example, they’re much more hawkish on Russia and supportive of Ukraine. There’s also a debate inside the text over tariffs, between a free-market writer and Peter Navarro, who is now in the White House—but even there, Navarro calls for a much more limited tariff program than what Trump has pursued.

"> “Restore the family as the center-piece of American life and protect our children”  It's not a coincidence that those are 14 words. ""OUR children"" gives it away the dogwhistle.

"I think this is a deeply profound observation. It will be very difficult to find any group with the intellectual capacity of imagining and implementing the level of change that America needs to function again as a prosperous democracy.  The structures that are now being dismantled arose organically across 50 states and federal institutions over a period of centuries and represent an intricate web of rules, practices and customs. They have been destroyed at the core. The core system of checks and balances has been shown to be outdated and inadequate, unfit for purpose in the 21st century. It simply cannot cope with internet media, AI and modern technological advances. This means rewriting the Constitution itself from scratch ... probably even needing to ditch British Empiricism as the basis for legal thought and develop a more robust framework that future Trump imitators that are on the way will be unable to crack.  I simply do not see in America the full realisation of what Trump and GOP have destroyed and the complexity of the task that lay ahead. I think America will try to rebuild the exact same structure that has been proven unsustainable simply because no one is smart enough to attempt building anything better.",trisul-108,2025-04-23T15:09:58,10

"This sounds very inaccurate. Are you trying to market it? With how things are going, and how hilariously incompitent the scripture is with how politics work, there isn't going to be any kind of household where men work and mothers stay home, with families today struggling to pay rent with even one family member working.  The scripture also states that it wants to imprison and seek the death penalty for transgender individuals, describing them as sexual predators simply for existing.   As for ""no educational TV"", this acts as if there's a cable TV overseen by the government, but the massive majority of America uses streaming services like Disney Plus and Netflix to put Bluey and Cocomelon on for their kids. And as for ""minimally involved in healthcare"", RFK is currently working on a registry full of people with autism that will function similarly to a national sex offender registry.   I encourage you not only to re-read the scripture, but to not downplay what it wants, and to compare it to what they are currently doing, because while P25 is full of what they want out in the open to tell their followers, there are things they're talking about openly now that are not in the scripture.  As for the racial discrimination, this is true, but their base sees all of what you have listed as a plus, and is talking about deporting natural-born US Citizens to El Salvador based off the color of their skin to a prison where a visible mound of dead bodies is visible on Google Maps, meaning it's very likely a death camp instead of a prison.
