"I've never met a group of people so hell bent on being asleep (anti-woke) to reality and wearing it proudly as a badge of honor.   It reminds me of that song by a Perfect Circle ""Counting bodies like sheep"" [YouTube link](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hBy0dzUzHUk&feature=shared) The song basically is about an abuser (Hitler, judging by the background track) telling people to ""go back to sleep"" to save them from choice, truth and reason.  It's an old song, and kind of a creepy listen, but very maga.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-06T18:31:45,31

"Saw this quote that made me think about what is going on these days in America:  ""There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""

Are they going to lose enough of their audience to know how Fox News felt after its correct reporting on the 2024 election?,wonkalicious808,2025-04-06T22:38:57,5
"Simply reporting facts is ""anti-trump."" Unbelievable.    She says she's deleting it from her Facebook. I would love to see what her Facebook feed looks like.",Patient_Reach439,2025-04-07T06:09:29,3
