"I don't know how anyone can afford to live there.  I get apartment tours in my TikTok feed. I'll see something that looks like a closet for 3k a month.  That'd be the mortgage on a massive house in my state. Hell, I saw one for sale for 1.2 million. That's a lot, but reasonable for the neighborhood in NYC. But on top of the 1.2m was monthly fees of 6k!   How can anyone afford that?",cathbadh,2025-05-04T06:38:57,33

"Don‚Äôt worry about Florida, we‚Äôre clearly seeing an influx of Red voters here in Florida.  Actually in my orbit I know of two lefties who left for bluer pastures.  Florida has become a hell for lefties - and it‚Äôs grand!  More importantly, cool to realize that about two years ago (ish) - for the first time in Florida‚Äôs history the state had more registered Republicans than Democrats, and that disparity is growing.    Let me say that again, for the **first time in Florida‚Äôs history**.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T19:12:45,130

"We worked remotely in Florida from January 2021-April 2021. We could see the state getting busier and busier as time went on. Part of it was spring breakers, but it was also the mass influx of people moving there.",According_To_Me,2025-05-04T13:11:12,2

It's amazing how the government reshaped Florida from a purple state into a reliable conservative bastion. Not just one demographic but a diverse coalition from Miami Dade to North Florida¬†,whiteKreuz,2025-05-03T20:05:38,21
Those same Democrats from California. Are headed to Texas in trying to ruin it as well. If they ever turn Texas blue. I think that will be the end of it.,Zestycheesegrade,2025-05-03T21:08:42,12

"It is, as I recall DeSantis won his first term by a gnats ass against a DEI flunky.  Covid also ended up being a blessing, because people really got a sense of the government they were living under in EVERY state, and when they looked around for somewhere to go, FL looked pretty great with it's freedom and no state income tax.  People with the means to do so, Red and Blue, have shifted around the country quite a bit in the last 5 years.  It's part of what makes America great.",TedriccoJones,2025-05-04T06:16:55,21

"Thanks. I love them both and they've shown us five kids lots of love raising us.  Once they have lived their lives to the fullest, and their times both come (not to sound morbid) and we've settled everything, my plan is to find a smaller town in central Florida not far from either coast, but not far from Orlando either. Just a nice distance to everything, pleasant to live in, and just live out my days there, fishing, camping, scuba diving, enjoying beaches and sun. Enjoying 60-degree weather while everyone up north is freezing their butts off during winter. I'm a warm-weather guy. Always have been, so Florida heat doesn't bother me at all.  My thoughts are to find a place big enough that siblings and their families can come visit the ""fun uncle"" in Florida whenever they want and have a place to stay for free for family vacations. (I'm living the single life but have nine (soon to be ten) nieces and nephews to spoil and be the ""fun uncle"" towards).",ITrCool,2025-05-03T21:15:23,8

"I live in South FL but have lived in the Orlando area, central FL has big Orlando, but the outskirts, suburbs and ‚Äúbedroom communities‚Äù are many.  One can live a very urban life, a country life, small town, and anything in between - take your pick!",cliffotn,2025-05-03T22:15:41,8

That‚Äôs what I like about it!! Hurricanes I‚Äôll gladly risk and deal with. We have tornadoes where I live now in the Midwest. That risk comes up WAAAAY more than hurricanes. Especially during the spring and the fall.,ITrCool,2025-05-03T22:21:33,3
"Oh big time!  And inland is pretty darn safe, life safety wise.  The huge/vast majorly of deaths are folks on the beach who were too belligerent to evacuate.  Inland central Florida is literally where tons of coast dwellers go to if they have to evacuate.  Yeah we have flooding, but one can mitigate that by not buying in a 20yr (or whatever) floor plain, and always carrying good insurance.  I‚Äôve lost power for a week, but I lived.  I remember when we lived in North Michigan as a teen and we lost power for 5 days in January, that sucked 1000x more than not having AC!",cliffotn,2025-05-03T22:27:58,2
