This is not newsworthy. No one should listen to that man. Just watch the looks all his female colleagues give him whenever he opens his misogynistic mouth. He's so ignorant and evil,abida_abida,2025-05-01T21:36:28,2

It was pretty dumb to admit we have such a historically unpopular president he needs to go but then think the best person to replace him is his VP.      I wonder how bad Biden's numbers would have had to be for Kamala to think hey maybe I am not the strongest candidate here given my close ties as VP?  I'm not sure there is a number? Kamala was just gonna do her thing regardless of how silly it was,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-01T22:02:42,0

"By what metric do you think she ran a good campaign? She was unable to message well enough to distance herself from Joe Biden or communicate why she should not have to distance herself from him. She lost because people were unhappy with the Biden administration. Obviously I think that is nuts, he was doing a good job. But nonetheless that is why she lost.",henningknows,2025-05-02T07:07:40,2
