"> Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a lawsuit in early April, seeking a temporary restraining order to restore funding.  > In the settlement, signed Friday morning, the agency agreed not to freeze, terminate or interfere with the state’s access to USDA funds based on Title IX violations without going through the legally required process.  > Frey and Gov. Janet Mills celebrated the news at a Friday afternoon press conference in Augusta, saying the USDA has “backed down.”  > “It’s good to feel a victory like this,” Mills said, appearing exuberant as she declared that the state had won this court battle with the Trump administration.  > “I stood in the White House and when confronted by the president of the United States, I told him I’d see him in court. Well we did see him in court, and we won.”",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-02T16:36:30,22
"You know this has to piss Trump off so badly. Governor Mills publicly rebuked him, Trump acted big and tough about getting revenge, and now he and admin are tucking tail and backing down. He just publicly lost to a woman, which is his biggest nightmare.",thedybbuk,2025-05-02T17:09:20,7
