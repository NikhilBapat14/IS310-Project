"*Bribery and Corrupt Financial Schemes:*        Trump is engaged in a complex bribery scheme using cryptocurrency, stock manipulation, and pay-to-play access.       • Trump-affiliated crypto projects, like “Trump Coin,” have been linked to fraudulent investors under federal investigation.          There are strong indications that foreign entities are using these crypto schemes to funnel money directly to Trump-affiliated businesses.       • Violates 18 U.S.C. § 201 (Bribery of Public Officials) – Accepting or soliciting anything of value in exchange for official acts.        • Violates the Foreign Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 8) – Accepting foreign financial benefits without congressional approval.        *DJT Stock Manipulation:*           • Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) stock allocations have been flagged as a tool for insider trading and illicit payoffs.          High-dollar donors and foreign investors have been given stock in exchange for political influence.        • Violates 15 U.S.C. § 78j (Securities Fraud) – Fraudulent schemes involving securities to deceive investors.         • Violates 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) – Financial deception via electronic communications.

"Another day, another grift...  The Republican party spent the better part of the last 4 years laying it on thick for the cameras while launching partisan investigation after investigation into the so-called ""Biden crime family."" But their political performances in Congress led them nowhere.  And the real frustrating part is how most of their allegations against Joe Biden and family are far more credible when levied against the Trump family.  For instance:  The Trump family and associates are currently set to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues from the World Liberty Financial project, which will amount to over $300 million based on initial valuation.  And when it comes to this whole crypto scheme fiasco, it's been reported that Trump and associates have brought in millions in trading fees from $TRUMP, and this was right before the coins value crashed, causing thousands of investors to lose (collectively) nearly $2 billion after investing in the Trump ""memecoin.""  > The Trump family and their partners have yielded almost $100 million just in trading fees from $TRUMP,   > More than 813,000 crypto wallets have lost a total of $2 billion after buying President Donald Trump’s memecoin  These early buyers were direct affiliates to the Trump organization, so there's no justification. Save me the mental gymnastics Trump supporters. Besides, you never gave any Biden the benefit of the doubt.  moving on:  Trump has spent his entire life and career taking advantage of his power and privilege to enrich himself at the expense of others.  During his presidency, Trump committed to improving Chinese IP protections and opening up its financial sector to US businesses, which conflicted with his personal real estate ambitions in China, including dozens of properties and hotels.  In 2020, it was revealed that Trump also had previously undisclosed bank accounts in China and during his first term, his family benefitted financially from trademarks from the Chinese government.  **Trump the ""business man"":**  Trump is a notorious financial fraud who has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.  Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:  - Trump Casinos and Hotels  - Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative) - Trump Magazine - Trump Airlines - Trump Beverages - Trump ""The Game"" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame) - Trump Mortgages - Trump Steaks - Trump Travel Site - Trumpnet - Trump Tower Tampa - Trump Vodka - Trump Fragrances - Trump Mattress - Trump Network - Tour de Trump - Trumped! (Trump Radio) - Truth Social (due to its wild overvaluation and massive losses.)  He has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.  Trump has profited off of screwing over small businesses and financial associates who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor.   He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even lied to get on the Forbes list, and he often threatens to sue anyone who publicly speculates about his real net worth.  Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. But he continued borrowing money, particularly from his father and from banks, which allowed him to avoid paying income tax for many years, all while he amassed unsustainable debts, only to dump them onto others later.  Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.  This isn't even the tip of the iceberg, but it's evident that Donald Trump is not the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters. He has merely spent his entire life cashing in on his circumstances at the expense of others.  Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.  During his first term, Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes  As part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and it was forced to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.  Then there's Trump University...  In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term ""university"" to describe his grifting scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, ""misleading and even illegal.""  Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.  There was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the ""university"" public. Trump University was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs. Trump was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.  Trump is also known infamously for not paying what he owes. This includes hundreds of millions in loan forgiveness and legal penalties, and unpaid bills for rally costs at cities around the country.  As president, Donald Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties were forced to overspend at Trump properties and on accommodations.  Trump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.  Trump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.  It should also be noted that just prior to his inauguration, Trump met in private with several billionaires. These billionaires pledged millions of dollars towards his presidency and were invited to sit in the VIP section at his inauguration while his supporters stood out in the cold. How symbolic.  These plutocrats, oligarchs and special interests assured Trump that they will be in lockstep with his administration, and an administration that is the richest in US history. Populism my ass...  Trump is a notorious grifter. Everything from your typical hats, T-shirts, clothing and accessories, to watches and jewelry, NFTs and digital collectibles, commemorative medallions and coins, Trump currency and trading cards, tacky sneakers, overpriced Bibles, cologne and perfume, among other merchandise and MAGA memorabilia that he continuously suckers his followers into buying. Easy money that typically gets reserved for his legal fees.   Make no mistake here, Donald Trump is not ""America first,"" he is Trump first, *always.* He is always thinking of ways to exploit his power and privilege to enrich himself. He has no reason to stop, in fact, he has an even greater incentive this time around to continue taking advantage of his presidency to deepen his own pockets.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-23T23:48:10,8
