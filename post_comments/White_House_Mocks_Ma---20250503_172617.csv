"The trump administration wrongfully deported him, and now they're making fun of him?! They should be making fun of themselves because they're the ones who violated a 2019 immigration judge's order! Abrego Garcia had an order from a judge blocking him from being sent to El Salvador and he was sent there anyway. No one has been held accountable.  I really wish Abrego Garcia could sue these trump admin idiots for defamation. But he can't, so they can say anything they want about him and he's unable to respond. You're not big and tough if you talk trash about someone who can't respond to you. üôÑ They are cowards.  These people will go on and on about Abrego Garcia on social media but they won't say these things in court. That says it all.",sachiprecious,2025-05-03T17:31:30,76
