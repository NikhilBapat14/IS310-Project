*From Bloomberg News reporter Kevin Whitelaw*  President Donald Trump insisted he doesn’t plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite his sustained criticism over the pace of interest rate cuts.  “Why would I do that?” he said in an interview on NBC’s *Meet the Press with Kristen Welker* that aired Sunday. “I get to replace the person in another short period of time.”  [Read the full story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-04/trump-rules-out-firing-total-stiff-powell-over-rate-cuts-pace).,bloomberg,2025-05-04T08:35:34,4
"The independence of the Fed is a modern part of checks and balances in the Federal Government.  Of course the Federal Reserve is not one of the three independent, co-equal branches of the Federal Government according to the Constitution.   But the enabling and governing legislation the established the Fed and maintains it is designed to insulate the Fed from just the kind of pressure that Trump is trying to apply.

"Powell’s term is up next year a believe. Trump just has to wait him out, doesn’t even need to fire him. Then he can put someone in to fuck shit up",mostdope28,2025-05-04T10:05:18,2

Doubt it. He just knows the market will crash if he says otherwise.,Agitated_Rain_1506,2025-05-04T10:29:58,1
"Trump doesn't understand economics at all, and he doesn't listen to those that do.  He's a complete disaster.  All he knows is real estate.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-04T13:23:38,1
Did he call him a “Total stiff”? lmao. trump is such a dork. It’s like he’s living in a movie from the 80s. Such an embarrassing person.,OldPiano6706,2025-05-04T22:26:51,1
I don't get why people are surprised by this. Trump has always had strong opinions about the Fed and rate cuts. He's been vocal about it for ages.,SunKissedLadie,2025-05-04T08:50:07,-2
Powell is the chairman and only exercises a casting vote in the event of a deadlock. Trump seems to think that he is the boss and makes unilateral decisions in the same way that he does.  Even if Powell was replaced  by a stooge tomorrow it would make little difference to its decision making but would further crater trust and confidence with the resultant flight of capital.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-05T02:50:33,2
"Bonds would “go wild” if there was a serious attempt at firing, and especially the GOP doesn’t want to pay higher rates (the GOP prefers to use the bond market to finance govt, while Democrats prefer taxes on the wealthy).   IRL, all the wealthy would need to do is buy more higher yield bonds plus maybe more inflation hedges, .. and that would freeze out new real investments (in, say, factories) until tariffs and/or automation is resolved in their favor.",IronyElSupremo,2025-05-04T09:49:55,10
Cause you can’t. Thirty six constitutional crises at the same time is proving to be a little more difficult than you imagined and you can’t take on this one without wrecking the entire system.,leontes,2025-05-04T08:38:48,10

"They would if they could… Obama raised the effective tax rate on the 400 wealthiest from 17% to 23% and then for the top 0.1% he raised their basic tax rate by 6%.  All while increasing the EIC (“earned income credit”) for the poorest.   Still one has to take care not to induce a recession.  Also the wealthy buy municipal bonds to directly finance city/town projects (in return for tax-exempt interest payments), so again need to be cognizant of that.",IronyElSupremo,2025-05-04T13:45:15,7
Shouldn’t be. They’ve tried it many times. I have clients who still rant about Obama. From their 30 million dollar fourth beach house.,Few_Prize3810,2025-05-04T17:52:57,5
"I guess my qualm is with their support for corporate bailouts and prior support for broad tax increases that affect the working class rather than concentrated on the obscenely wealthy. Bill Clinton's passing of the GLBA (an act that also had broad dem support in congress) was a pretty solid ""make the rich richer"" scheme and opened the can of worms that led to AIG's bailout in 2008 which came at the expense of taxpayers. To me corporate protectionist policy is like tax reductions for the wealthy with extra steps. I don't know how it all balances out in the end but I do know Dems have, at minimum, enabled this kind of corruption during times in which they really didn't have to.  They (usually) raise taxes equally rather than equitably. But it does vary with the Democratic party not just federally but also at the state and local levels whereas Republicans are often pretty one-note (in the worst way) on this issue across the board",ariasingh,2025-05-04T18:40:39,0
