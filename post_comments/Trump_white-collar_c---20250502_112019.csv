It costs the public because the pardons erased $1bn worth of restitution that the criminals would otherwise have had to pay.,aleph32,2025-05-02T11:56:49,43
That's his talent pool! Where else do you think he can find that many crooks to run the government? /s,thieh,2025-05-02T11:51:35,8
"Fraud artists just need to make sure that MAGA gets their flat service fee and for their loyalty to their racket, their ~~crimes~~ freedom will be handled appropriately! The right people know that if they using the right services and everybody knows the very good people who are using their services walk if they make money and they love to make money they can get back to work creating their very MAGA jobs and supporting the most important President they've ever seen to save American and save American businesses.",postsshortcomments,2025-05-02T12:48:15,4
They only give a shit about spending when it’s a D in. We’ll go bankrupt and they’ll still make excuses and blame Biden.,Pope_Smoke,2025-05-02T18:47:09,2
And how much did he personally gain?  The rumor at the end of his first term was that he was selling pardons at $2MM a pop.,Sideshow_Bob_Ross,2025-05-02T23:25:09,1
"It really is a good time to commit white collar crime. I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking with all this obeying the laws bullshit. Fuck it. I'm gonna do 35 in a 25 tomorrow. I'll start small, but who knows where it will lead!",YakiVegas,2025-05-03T02:58:25,1
$1 billion isn't that much in 2025.  Can't even build a bridge for that.  Oh also - the prize for pardoning the worst white collar crim in history goes to Bill Clinton for pardoning Marc Rich,box-cable,2025-05-02T11:28:34,-31
That was sunk cost.,specqq,2025-05-02T15:56:36,6
"Ya, but Trump probably made half a billion for his crypto scam, so it’s just good business.",DelayedIntentions,2025-05-02T15:20:01,8
"It would be interesting, how much costs for the imprisoning are saved now. Does this add up to the „erasure“ of 1 billon dollars?",Jenne1504,2025-05-02T19:30:07,-1
There it is- the “what about.”  Can’t just say “That’s bad we’re not gonna do that!”  Gotta do it 10x more to the MAX and have that “Whatabout” ready.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T11:37:10,19
"Even 1 dollar deprived from the American people is too much.  Let me ask you a simple question: Was Clinton pardoning Marc Rich bad?  If so, why is Trump pardoning white collar criminals NOT bad then?",periphery72271,2025-05-02T12:05:03,10
"Nah, America made Donald Trump president again. Worst pardon ever.",LuvKrahft,2025-05-02T11:35:41,5
"One of the people cited in the article owed $680 million. He was sentenced to 4 years in federal prison, which on average costs about $44,000/year. So not even close.",someperson42,2025-05-02T21:21:57,1
"Ooooo I have the answer! “When my guy does it, it’s fine, cool and normal even. But your guy does it, it’s the most heinous shit ever and should be condemned by all!!!”  This is the best political discourse and isn’t hype toxic at all.",IndependentSpecial17,2025-05-02T16:54:32,3
