"Folks on the right will point out that the mothers technically consented. However, it's important to note that ICE forced that solution by prohibiting them from communicating with their families or attorneys. They were legally entitled to leave their children in the US with other caretakers, but they were actually prohibited from making those arrangements.  The options they had were taking their kids with them or abandoning them in government custody.",Delicious_Toad,2025-04-28T12:16:25,31

"Here's more detail about the case with the 4-year-old with cancer:  >GRACIE WILLIS: That‚Äôs correct. We‚Äôre not attorneys on that case, but we‚Äôre working closely with the attorneys representing that family. This family was brought into detention less than 24 hours before the plane took off in the midmorning on Thursday. And the attorney who‚Äôs working with that family was actually with them at the ICE appointment where they were checking in. The kids were ready for school. They were expecting to go to school later that day. The family was taken into custody, asked for communication with their lawyer, who was outside, and were denied that.  >That attorney filed what‚Äôs called an administrative stay of removal, which is a request for ICE to just temporarily halt any deportation in the interest of something happening. And in this case, the lawyer requested the opportunity to file paperwork, complicated paperwork, with the court to provide immigration options to the mother and especially to allow this 4-year-old to continue treatment. The attorney filed paperwork with ICE explaining what this child‚Äôs medical situation was, explaining the diagnosis, and didn‚Äôt receive any kind of a response until the family was already on a plane on Friday morning.  First of all, how traumatic for those kids that they got ready to go to school only to be told that they were suddenly going to be sent to live in a different country!! And secondly, the lawyer filed the proper paperwork but there wasn't any response until the family was already on a plane. And you know how it is with this administration: Once you're out of the country, they can say ""There's nothing we can do!""",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T12:40:31,13

"I can‚Äôt believe people voted for this again. What a mental country we have here. Deporting a 4-year old with cancer without due process, their medication, or allowing a doctor to see him before is beyond inhumane. The dad got a lawyer and said he was trying to keep the kid here but the order was to send mom and kid back to Honduras. I really hope Honduras can step in medically for this poor kid, who is a US Citizen btw.",No_Bad_Juju,2025-04-29T00:52:54,1

"They definitely did with that deportation.    Don't know the type of support there is in Honduras, but I'm sure it'd take what little precious time to get them situated, compared to whatever care they had here.

"No, the (trump-appointed!) judge said that there was no meaningful process in the case of the two-year-old. Supposedly the mother wrote a note saying that she was taking her child with her, but we don't know the process of how that took place. The note could be fake or a result of coercion. And actually, the mothers in both of these cases said they had no choice about whether or not to take their kids with them.",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T12:42:37,3

"they were not allowed to contact their families to make arrangements for their partners or next of kin to get the kids. The kids would have been left in the custody of immigration officers. In a normal world, the kids would likely be reunited with their next of kin later on but this isn‚Äôt a normal world.

"I once worked with a group of people who provide pediatric cancer care in the developing country. Pediatric cancers are cancers with high survival expectancy in the developed countries with 80+ (sometimes 90%) survival rate, while in developing countries (including middle income countries in eastern Europe) the overall survival rate is around 20% simply because treatments exist but unavailable.  Some numbers for Honduras are here. Or rather, they don't even have numbers. Just FYi, survival rate of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is 95%-ish in developed countries. https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/ChildhoodCancer-Profile-21-ENG-Honduras.pdf",HannahArdent,2025-04-28T19:44:02,4
