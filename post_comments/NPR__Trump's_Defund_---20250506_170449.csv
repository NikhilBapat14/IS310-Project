“NPR's independence is non-negotiable.”  What independence?! You can’t listen for five minutes without being bombarded with liberal propaganda!,rdenghel,2025-05-06T17:20:13,185
Why does the government need to prop up failing entities? Survive on your own or die.,cossbobo,2025-05-06T17:50:28,54
Fuk NPR.  Voice of the left.,ApricotNo2918,2025-05-06T17:18:32,48
"Now the left has been seen as wanting to demolish the 1st amendment, by somehow carving out certain speech as not being protected, you know, their call to ban “hate” speech and “disinformation”, and “misinformation”.  And how they’ve silenced conservative voices all over social media.  The left **including* NPR have zero credibility left regarding free speech.   Of course they scream “free speech” if they don’t get their way.",cliffotn,2025-05-06T17:39:42,26
Oh no. The government won’t fund leftist propaganda. How horrible.,flyinghorseguy,2025-05-06T18:16:00,38

How? We aren't making the shutdown. Get funding. Everyone else has to,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-06T17:57:38,11
I was told that government funding only contributes to a small % of their budget. I guess they were wrong lol.,Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-06T18:44:45,12
"LOL, not receiving federal grants in no way, shape or form prevents them from exercising their speech. Americans do not need to fund their bias and to FORCE taxpayers to fund them is a violation of THEIR free speech. Americans voted (spoke out) against this kind of waste at the ballot box!",nonnativespecies,2025-05-06T22:33:18,6
You have the right to speak freely. Not for the government to pay for your megaphone.,Scamandrius,2025-05-06T20:37:44,6
That’s rich. He didn’t say they had to stop reporting or offering their political opinions. Just that taxpayers won’t be paying for it! Same for stupid PBS — even Sesame Street is wokified and unwatchable now.,Szorja,2025-05-06T20:18:24,4
"On the contrary. Not receiving ~~bribes~~ funding from the government will actually make these news organizations more independent, not less.",Hearts-Heroes,2025-05-06T19:11:45,6
So the government can’t limit its own speech? Do people just hit themselves in the head with blunt objects before writing.,sixtysecdragon,2025-05-06T18:30:35,2

NPR can fund itself the way every other radio and tv station does. Why should the government use taxpayer dollars to pay their bills for them?,Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-05-06T19:47:08,1
Nice try...but nope.,DreadPirateGriswold,2025-05-06T20:45:15,1
We have a first amendment right to be forced to fund a new organization that is blatantly biased? Who knew I actually disliked the first amendment?,Zaphenzo,2025-05-06T20:49:01,1
PSA for anyone in the bleachers: needing money from daddy is not independence.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-06T17:43:44,85
"To be independent, they must be free from the government's purse. If the government pays them, they aren't independent.",whippingboy4eva,2025-05-06T18:28:44,45
Yeah the government shouldn't be funding any sort of media that has political bias and that includes social bias that is In any way considered a political topic. Democrats love to try to force social changes and then claim that they aren't politicized.,fordr015,2025-05-06T18:47:29,16
Even if they were hard core MAGA or better yet balanced the government still shouldn’t be required to fund it,chillthrowaways,2025-05-06T19:25:00,16
"It's right there in the First Amendment, that ""Congress shall establish, pay to npr.""  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads:   ""**Congress shall** make no law respecting an **establish**ment of religion**,** or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people **p**e**a**ceabl**y** **to** assemble, a**n**d to **p**etition the Gove**r**nment for a redress of grievances"".",Papa_Ganda,2025-05-07T06:43:06,0
They say that then they charge other stations boat loads of cash for NPR 'content.' Those stations get federal funding. This is why the EO forbade indirect funding. All those member stations are going to have extra strings attached to their dollars from DC now.  The local morning radio guy here loves to point out he does three hours of radio in a major metro area and his show is exactly three people including him. If you ever listen to the credits for a single 5 minute NPR piece there's like 20+ people on it. NPR is a jobs program for otherwise unemployable leftists. They couldn't compete in the real marketplace because it requires you to actually be productive and bust your butt.,ngoni,2025-05-06T20:42:16,7
