Democrats block obvious scam.Â ,NickelBackwash,2025-05-08T17:35:47,60
Good. Cryptocurrencies ate a horrible idea. A pump & dump financial scheme that also destroys the environment with it's energy demands.Â ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-05-08T17:58:14,18
Good. Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies should be banned.,highroller_rob,2025-05-08T20:34:51,8
How did/can they block this but everything else is basically free for Republicans?,Spam_Hand,2025-05-08T17:41:36,4
"But wait.... Reddit, Twitter, Bluesky, and others insisted for the last week both parties were the same and Democratic Party would pass this...  It's almost like...",forgedbygeeks,2025-05-08T19:03:10,16
Wait until you hear about fiat...,chaosorbs,2025-05-08T18:10:52,-22
Because this is one of those things they can block via the filibuster. Cabinet appointments aren't.,Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-08T19:10:22,10
Maybe the GOP is getting tired of being scammed by Trump too.,RealGianath,2025-05-08T17:46:07,2
"This is the Legislative branch. Republicans don't pass much legislation, because Democrats actually have a say in the matter. Bills need 60 votes to go through the Senate.   The stuff i assume you see as basically free for Republicans are the executive orders and stuff coming from the Executive Branch.  The Executive Branch wouldn't have quite as easy of a time with things if we still had an independent Judicial Branch.   But since the GOP can't actually pass legislation, the GOP members in the Legislative Branch have mostly focused on pushing through Trump judges and stuff. That only requires 50 votes.   This whole strategy of governing is basically from the Unitary Executive Theory that a lot of these people push. They literally want the President to have authority similar to a king.   This idea of governance is pushed by organizations like the Heritage Foundation, who are the ones picking the judges for the GOP to approve.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory",GeoLogic23,2025-05-09T06:57:53,1
"Both sides is one of two things.   A right wing lie which means ""I'm ashamed of my republican view""Â    Or   Pointless doomerism. Hopelessness is not cool, and definitely not productive. Wet need hope!Â    Either way, both sides is bullshit.Â ",NickelBackwash,2025-05-08T19:06:32,17
The local fiat currency is backed by the world's biggest economy and military superpower.  What does cryptocurrency have to back it by comparison?,Logical_Hare,2025-05-08T18:27:44,11

"Mathematics, decentralization, and scarcity.  There will never be more than 21 million BTC.  Your local fiat will eternally inflate and devalue.  Edit: Oof, the normie subs never get it. ðŸ¤£",chaosorbs,2025-05-08T18:35:54,-29
The result of orange fuck involving himself in the crypto space. The negatives are just amplified when the POTUS is doing them all,Chef_Skippers,2025-05-09T07:45:52,2
"You know thatâ€™s not quite correct, right? Thereâ€™s absolutely nothing preventing all the miners agreeing to a network update that raises the limit - itâ€™s just code. It wouldnâ€™t be much different than a normal network update or like when they rolled it back after the overflow bug.   Thereâ€™s nothing special in the code or the math about 21 million BTC other than thatâ€™s the number that was chosen.",ItsLaterThanYouKnow,2025-05-09T03:02:15,0
