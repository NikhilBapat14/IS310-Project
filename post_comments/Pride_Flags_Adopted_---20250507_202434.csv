"I'm a little surprised SLC went with those laws, or they probably didn't have a choice since they are state laws.   The place is a tourist mecca with now two major sports teams.  That sort of bigoted crap can put a dent in their economy.  Plus it's only a five hour drive to Vegas which has no discrimination laws and three major teams, one of which is really really really good.",tinyE1138,2025-05-08T07:17:01,3

SLC though hasn’t elected a GOP candidate for mayor since 1979. They’re a liberal city compared to surrounding MAGAland. I used to live in SLC.,TyrionsShadow,2025-05-08T07:55:54,2
I know which is why I'm curious about the laws.  I'm assuming those are state laws being imposed on the city.,tinyE1138,2025-05-08T08:04:57,1
