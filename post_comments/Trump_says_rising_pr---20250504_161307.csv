I mean his tariffs did lower global oil demand as global trade fell so in that regard tanking global trade and raising prices on most goods did reduce crude oil prices and thus gas prices (as crude was one of the things explicitly not tariffed).

If he okays military strikes against Iran, prices may go up.",Buttfulloffucks,2025-05-04T17:59:24,6
