"1) The long answer to this is loooong, haha. The short answer is basically that groups coming to the US can be divided up into migrants (people who are here temporarily) and immigrants (people who are coming here permanently). Both of those groups can either be following the laws to come legally or not. If they're following the laws, migrants can use a whole lot of different ways to come to the US--things like the H-1B visa, which is a work permit that allows educated workers to work in the US for a few years at a time, or the H-2A visa, which allows agricultural workers to come work seasonally in the US, or Temporary Protected Status, which is given to refugees whose homelands are undergoing armed conflict or national disasters, and which allows them to work in the US. (If you were following the campaign and remember the Haitians story, that's what allowed those Haitians to live and work in the US.)  For immigrants who want to move here permanently, they can either become a permanent resident, in which case they have to get a [green card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card), or they [have to petition for citizenship](https://www.usa.gov/naturalization). Both of these processes are difficult and you are unlikely to be approved. Having close family in the US or some kind of extraordinary skills helps your chances. One quirk of the US immigration system that complicates things a lot is that we don't allow any given country's immigrants to make up more than 7% of the total immigrants to the US in a year, which has made things very complicated for some countries with high demand to immigrate here (mainly Mexico). That's led to a situation where someone from Sweden with a brother who's a U.S. citizen might be able to immigrate here legally in a few years, while somebody from Mexico with an American brother could easily be waiting decades or never get off the wait list.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-12T12:41:36,1
"2) Trump has indicated that that he wants to come after anyone who's in the U.S. illegally and deport them. A lot of his supporters seem to think he's going to prioritize deportations of ""criminals,"" which they believe means rapists, murderers, etc.--but Trump's view is that anyone who crossed into the country illegally is a criminal.  During his first presidency, he also attempted to limit a lot of the visas and programs that migrants are allowed to use to work legally in the country--cutting back on H1-B visas and trying to end Temporary Protected Status for certain countries. Most of this was caught up in court battles during his first presidency. He may be more effective this time around, though, because he's appointed a lot of judges that agree with him.  He's also talked about ending birthright citizenship, which is the American policy that anyone born in the US automatically becomes an American citizen, regardless of where their parents are from. It's not clear he has the authority to do this; the courts would probably determine that as well.  It's possible that he could go after immigrants who have already become citizens, as well. There is a process to do that called denaturalization, although currently it focuses on criminals--people who commit fraud on their citizenship applications or people who join terrorist organizations shortly after coming to the US. During his first presidency, Trump expanded these programs, although continued to focus on criminals. One of his advisors has tweeted that they intend to ""turbocharge"" that program going forward, but it's not clear what that means.  3) The border patrol is out in border states actively hunting down people crossing the border. But once they've crossed into the US, anyone without the proper papers/cards identifying them as a visa-holder or citizen will be at risk of being turned over to law enforcement. It's possible that the Trump administration *could* choose to start hunting people down more aggressively than they currently are.  It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen. There's a lot of things that Trump has indicated he wants to do that may not end up being logistically possible or a priority for his administration, or the courts might prevent him from doing that. But it's also possible that they let him do everything and he does it all.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-12T12:58:01,1
