"What badge?  They don't even present their badges.   Anyone can buy body armor and stick an FBI or Police patch on their body armor and play pretend.  That's exactly the problem with these people.  They are looking for reasons to execute, not arrest.",ledude1,2025-05-01T16:09:04,87

"Yeah and they‚Äôre pedos too. Apparently they like to arrest teenagers in their underwear so that means a lot of cringy forced touching took place. Forced them outside half naked / indecent exposure. How does that feel ICE? To be labeled as pedos, out there violating innocents to an extreme degree after you all swore an oath to protect and serve. They are the opposite of heros!

Luckily it's harder to become dictator here, buts there's only so much the constitution can do. It's only a peice of paper if nobody respects it. An example of this was when John Marshall and the supreme court ordered President Jackson to stop the Indian deportation west and he said: ""John Marshall made his decision, let him enforce it"".

"Yup. But technically, it was more of a ""setup"" than anything IMO.  I think they suspected Republicans would vote against it despite the fact that it's already illegal. That's why I think they snuck in that devastating curve ball:  ""raise your hands if you think that children with cancer who are citizens should not be deported.""  Every Democrat raised that hand. Not a single Republican did. It was so disgraceful it was straight up scandalous.   Personally, I think it was political theater just to see if they could force them between a rock and a hard place.  Either they vote against it and publicly expose themselves to their constituents - which has been on very shaky grounds for Republicans lately...  Or  They publicly defy Trump.   It's a lose -lose situation.  The biggest takeaway IMO: they all fear him enough to risk political self sabotage.   Which is kind of disturbing if you think about it - but I think this strategy is brilliant. I hope they rinse and repeat. üôÇ",TheMemeWarVeteran,2025-05-02T01:11:36,2
