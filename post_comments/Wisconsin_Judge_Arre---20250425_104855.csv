Arresting a state judge in a federal immigration case is already historic. Announcing it in a now-deleted tweet just makes it look like they wanted headlines without accountability.,fulltrendypro,2025-04-25T10:51:32,37

"Now kash Patel and Pam bondis real value are going to start to show. Having an FBI and DOJ completely in lock step with the President willing to do whatever he wants to attack enemies and imprison them is how we get true authoritarianism.

"From Bloomberg News reporters [David Voreacos](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ADjSGtL0H54/david-voreacos) and [Zoe Tillman](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AV4iFHxuN3g/zoe-tillman):  A state judge in Wisconsin was arrested Friday by federal agents after an investigation into whether she obstructed an immigration arrest last week.  Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was taken into custody Friday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that was later deleted. She was arrested around 8 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to Brady McCarron, a spokesman for the US Marshals Service.  The FBI had been examining whether Dugan helped an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel [reported](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2025/04/23/what-to-know-about-recent-ice-immigration-arrests-at-milwaukee-ozaukee-county-courthouse-wisconsin/83220526007/), citing unidentified sources.

When Patel was nominated I said he was low key the most dangerous one.  The FBI is far easier to corrupt than any other institution and much of what they do is done behind closed doors.  The amount of damage they can do ibefore anyone even realizes whats up is astounding.     And...Patel is also grossly unqualified and was confirmed for a 10 year term.,StashedandPainless,2025-04-25T10:55:51,7

"Exactly. The independence of the FBI is vital to our democracy. So much of what they do is secretive and behind closed doors, and because of that they have a lot of power to not be held accountable to the same checks as other institutions since they can cite their need to be secretive as vital to their function.

"Yes, she aided and abetted the escape of an illegal immigrant in her courtroom.

So now what happens to her? What are the next steps for this judge?,bluegrassgazer,2025-04-28T12:34:49,1
Like any other criminal proceeding she will likely end up being charged and jailed until she can be arraigned by another federal judge.  If people weren't so hellbent on fighting Trump with deportations this would never have happened. It's a losing issue for the democrats idk why they are doubling down on it. A vast majority of people support Trumps deportations.,AssignmentWeary1291,2025-04-28T12:39:37,1
"So, she's getting due process?  Why does the 5th amendment apply to her but not to these people who are being kidnapped and removed from the country?  >Fifth Amendment  >No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.  I would argue that this judge is following the law as stated in the constitution, but The President and ICE are not.",bluegrassgazer,2025-04-28T12:42:37,1
"Well yeah, everyone get's due process. When you get arrested, they take you to jail and then you see a judge. You're not just given a ticket and then let loose until court.  The fifth amendment is simply the right to remain silent as to not incriminate yourself. She isn't being forced to speak for herself or denied that right. It has nothing to do with a president or ICE, it's simply the right to not speak.  The Fifth Amendment **ensures the protection against self-incrimination**, a fundamental right in the United States legal system. This provision means that individuals cannot be forced to provide evidence or testimony that could be used against them in a criminal case.  Illegal immigrants are not being ""kidnapped"" that is an emotional blackmail argument, they are being arrested for breaking federal law and subsequently deported as that is the punishment for entering the country illegally.",AssignmentWeary1291,2025-04-28T12:48:16,1
">People getting deported are not getting due process.  In some cases, even US citizens are not getting due process, but the fifth amendment (can't you read?) says nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.",bluegrassgazer,2025-04-28T12:59:28,1
"They have indeed gotten due process, everyone deported has a deportation order, how do you think they know who they are and where to find them? You act as if the government is not aware of these people already. The difference is this Administration is actually doing something about it, whereas the prior administration would rather they rape, murder, and kill American citizens.  Also there is not a single US citizen who hasn't gotten due process since Trump took office. Anyways why does anyone care about due process now all the sudden? Nobody cared when the J6ers were locked up for years without due process?  Edit: too add to this, i did some research, when ICE arrests an illegal immigrant they see a judge within 35 days and are typically ordered to be removed. This is coming from the head of ICE Tom Homan himself. So yes they are getting due process, the media just doesn't want to report that because then they look like shit and lose their narrative with the people who cannot read for themselves and instead rely solely upon the Media.",AssignmentWeary1291,2025-04-28T13:05:42,1
"A deportation order is not due process as much as an arrest warrant is due process.  Judges' orders are being ignored.  Children are disappearing without their parents knowing what happened to them.  It's shameful.  The vast majority of the people deported to El Salvador had no criminal records.  If somebody is convicted of rape or murder and they are not a US citizen, then go ahead and deport them because that's due process.  To deny people, whether citizens or not, the right to this is unconstitutional.  I stand for the Constitution, not some fascist strongman wannabe.",bluegrassgazer,2025-04-28T13:24:33,1

"\>Besides it’s absolutely laughable that you talk of due process and support a Felon as your president  A felon? oh you mean that ridiculous case where they couldn't name an underlying crime (a crime which mind you is still completely unknown lmfao) and ended up just saying to the jury ""you don't have to be specific on a crime just if you think it was done to hide something""? Which is completely unprecedented and goes against due process (you have a right to know what you are being charged for so that you can make adequate legal defense, that case violated Donald Trumps rights to a fair trial just an FYI) Yeah talking of due process that ""felony"" case was the largest shit on due process to have ever been presided over in the united states.
