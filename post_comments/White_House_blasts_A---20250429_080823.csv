">“Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Leavitt asked.  For one, Biden didn't hike inflation. The inflation spike was global.

"If the goal of the tariffs is to get people to buy American made products, as stated by this administration, then they should love that Amazon is doing this. Theoretically it will motivate consumers to opt for the American made versions after seeing the tariff cost.   The only fly in the ointment would be if there are no American made products, but surely the President would have accounted for that before starting a trade war, since he wouldn’t want his own people to needlessly suffer.

"Also probably worth noting that it's a minimum 2.45x on price. Often companies price based on margins, which would add even more to that. A $10 cost landed item that they need to keep a 50% margin on would cost $20 on Amazon's site. If they try to keep margin with the new tariffs, then the cost landed becomes $24.50, putting the new margin price at $49, not just $20 + $14.50 in tariffs. It's often not just a simple ""add the tariff, and that's the cost"", it's a working capital calculation. It's currently what's devastating the board game industry, sadly.   And to note, not all companies will do that, some will eat some of the tariff, some will pass the tariff on and sacrifice margin, but a good amount just need to keep the margin to survive. Many companies can't have a huge capital outlay (cost to manufacture + tariff) to make the same amount. If they are borrowing that capital, then their margins get eaten up even faster by debt servicing. It's crushing to everyone involved.",jsg7440,2025-04-29T10:35:34,1

"I dunno.  Bezos is pretty damn sharp. He didn't go from garage to billionaire by being stupid.       He knows what the supply chain looks like with internal reports that are better than anyone elses.  He's also quite good at reading the country.  He might have calculated that he would be better off if he aligns with the resistance.    Or, he's just mega pissed off about the tariffs.  They're killing Amazon and other middlemen.   My guess is both.  He's not an inherently bad actor.  When he bought the Washington Post he really was hands-off until Trump forced him to take a knee.",guttanzer,2025-04-29T09:42:18,1

"There've been a few like that. It's often because if they answer they'll be committing perjury (by lying), revealing perjury (by being honest but contradicting something else they said), or leaving themselves open for being caught in perjury (if they want to say something that contradicts the truth later). Or a combination.  Rambling meaninglessly is a clear deception or at least obfuscation tactic, but it's not perjury. ""I cannot recall"" technically can be, but it's hard to prove as a lie. So they usually go with one or both of those.",egosomnio,2025-04-29T12:23:18,1
