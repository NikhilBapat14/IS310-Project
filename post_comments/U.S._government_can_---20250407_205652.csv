They are the last person in Canada buying US Orange juice. Let them enjoy it ,Current_Animator7546,2025-04-07T21:25:27,1
"Oasis (Canadian company) apparently sources their oranges from Brazil! Happy fact...I can have my rare bottle of orange juice with a rare, big, unhealthy weekend breakfast again :) my kids will be happy. We have plenty of other juices that are fully Canadian (homegrown) that I was still occasionally buying as a treat but not orange juice. We're just too damned cold for citrus! All those Canadian eggs, bacon, sausage, potatos and (currently hothouse but soon to be homegrown) tomatoes will be washed down with a glass of OJ once again!  (I just learned oasis was Canadian and their sourcing so I'm pretty stoked for this weekend!)",temptemptemp98765432,2025-04-07T21:34:59,1
