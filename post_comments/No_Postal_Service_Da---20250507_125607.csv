Yup. Basically eroding the already somewhat limited privacy rights people in the US have.,SaveDnet-FRed0,2025-05-07T13:02:14,11
"Did you read it? The want to mine the postal service website data that includes personal information, addresses, credit card info, places you mailed items (ie, your connections) and your *ip address.* Creating a database of known ip addresses and the associated user names, key associations, addresses and phone numbers, etc. say goodbye to online privacy.      They also want access to the “photo data” or whatever it’s called, that takes photos of envelopes and digitizers the sender-recipient. This is a way of tracking who is corresponding with who.      This information is not only used to track people but to go “fishing” for connections that *may* point to criminal activity or evidence they can use. It’s a dangerous world when the government can make connections within databases as evidence of a crime.",Artistic-Law-9567,2025-05-07T15:54:05,3
