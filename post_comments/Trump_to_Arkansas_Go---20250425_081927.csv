He will destroy everything and then walk away as the government burns behind him with his billions and stolen money.

"Feb 25 - Trump, who has moved to slash government spending since taking office in January, wrote in **[all caps on his Truth Social platform that ""The Biden run FEMA has been a disaster. FEMA should be terminated](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250211-trump-says-us-disaster-relief-agency-should-be-terminated).""**  ""It has been slow and totally ineffective. **Individual states should handle storms, etc., as they come. Big savings, far more efficient!!!**, the Republican added.  Trump echoed claims from his 2024 election campaign that the Federal Emergency Management Agency unfairly spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" on Democratic areas during its response to last September's deadly storm in North Carolina, where it killed more than 100 people.  FEMA, which coordinates the federal response to disasters when states request help, denied the allegations at the time.  It further **condemned ""misinformation"" after Trump alleged that FEMA funds for victims of Hurricane Helene were being diverted to migrants, flood-hit property was being confiscated, and that storm victims were only getting $750 in total compensation.**",Thatisme01,2025-04-26T03:00:09,1

"I mean...part of that is by design. I grew up in one of these places (rustbelt red state). There's absolutely zero Dem messaging and unions have been functionally outlawed for so long that you need to get a good political education to understand what they are. Dems don't even try to message to the point that people genuinely have zero idea what our platform is. This effectively makes political awareness a matter of classism. It's like likelihood of going Dem increases 1:1 with how much time you and your family spent reading the newspaper in the morning growing up, tell me that's not an elitist state of affairs.  I genuinely think there's been a long-term Republican drive to age out Dem bases in these regions; by this point, many of the core government services we Dems thrive on were dismantled before most voters were born. We talk like this is a modern social media issue. It isn't. I remember things starting to get bad in the 90s with government functionality, partisan polarization, and the Dem brand going into the toilet. And it's been getting steadily worse.  Imo this has occurred to varying degrees across the entire country, excepting deep Dem strongholds. It's a large part the electoral trends we saw in 2024--where we lost ground pretty much across the board outside of highly educated voters. Republicans have accepted short-term electoral unpopularity in order to literally destroy societal memory of how things are supposed to work over the years.

Usually they move because ""it's cheaper"" or because CA is ""too liberal"", or some combination of those factors. But when life starts to happen - pregnancy, illness, unemployment, childcare, education, etc. - they find it isn't so black and white.    It may be cheaper to buy a house in Idaho when you want to start a family. But when you have to go unpaid for 3-6 months because there's no paid family leave, suddenly it doesn't seem much cheaper. When you get laid off and didn't get notice and now can't get health insurance because your new state didn't expand Medicare through the ACA, it's not cheaper anymore. There are a hundred little ways in which California makes life more fair and palatable thru it's ""liberal"" policies. People here take those for granted and assume those policies are nationwide.
