"The more important thing out of this episode was how they are using an EO to deploy military across the borders of three states by declaring that territory as part of a military base, under the guise of border security, but the EO allows them to arrest people, which is banned on US soil except on military bases due to trespassing.   Essentially, they’re declaring the land a military base and can arrest anyone. ",resonance462,2025-04-29T05:23:52,22

I just want some legit answers as I’ve heard so many different things from both sides and I don’t know what to think anymore, I just got into all this politics stuff.",JG_8504,2025-04-29T13:56:49,2

"From day one of Trump's first term there have been people working very hard trying to stop him. Full credit to all of them. It's a hard fight.  From day one there have been people who could have stopped him and didn't. From senators and reps failing to follow through on impeachment twice, to the Supreme Court giving him presidential immunity, to the voters at the poles, and a bunch of other people in between.  I don't see a lot of overlap between the people who want to stop him and the people who can.  After eight years of watching how this goes I don't have a whole lot of hope left.

They’re impounding congressionally appropriated funds or not spending them as required by law. They’re dismantling entire agencies that they have no control over. Sure, the courts may reverse some of it, but the damage is done in the interim because of how slow to move the courts are. And even when the courts move swiftly, people have still been wronged—like the people sent to CECOT despite a court order.   He incited an insurrection, evaded prosecution and was let off by his party during impeachment… what is legal is what is enforced. ",resonance462,2025-04-29T07:14:27,3

"I think it's important to remember that most people don't care about the state of policy, they care about the state of their conditions. If you look at where most people were going into the last election, their conditions were getting worse (whatever the news wanted to say about decreasing *rates* of inflation or how the economy was good by the numbers..that didn't match peoples actual experiences). So while Democrats may have been pushing slow but steady policy progress over the last couple presidencies, it wasn't enough to counteract all the bad stuff happening, mostly as a result of wealth consolidation. So people didn't get progress, just steady decline.  Trump was offering change. Terrible, terrible change. Unfortunately fascism appeals to mean and stupid people more than feckless liberalism, at least when material conditions are worsening. It was a time for new deal optimism, but unfortunately the Democratic gerentocracy is only capable in thinking in one mode, the hands off incrementalism of the damn 90's. So voters grabbed what they could and now we're fucked.  I think the part that makes people want to focus on the Democrats failings is that fundamentally most democrat voters and even leaders don't want fascism, so it sucks to see them cling so hard to the the same strategies while we get marched steadily towards it. With Republicans, this has always been the endgame (even if people like Biden insist they're good people and we should work with them, or Kamala insists on campaigning with them to peel of mythical centrists).",sh1tpost1nsh1t,2025-04-29T13:31:00,1

You do realize that only white Protestant men age 21+ were allowed to vote 250 years ago right?  It wasn’t even until 1830 that we had political parties. 1868 they gave states the power to let African Americans vote but most didn’t allow it.  It wasn’t until 1890 that women were even allowed to vote and Wyoming was the first.  1920 they actually made it federal that women could vote.   Oh but wait native Americans you know the people who actually should of had a say couldn’t even vote til 1940  1971 we finally allowed 18 years and up to vote.   So I guess if you mean the last 55 years at ballot you might be closer to right. It’s crazy though when you realize how little rights we have had for all Americans.,NoFilterD,2025-05-01T13:27:07,2

They just make the shooter look insane and strengthen the social support for the victim.   Even Trump didn't take over with weapons. He did it through steady streams of propaganda, podcasts, Fox news, x, truth social, and so forth.   The most effective way we can arm protestors is with live webcams, not live rounds.
