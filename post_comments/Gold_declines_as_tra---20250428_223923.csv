"I missed the easing part. Guess I was fooled by the empty ports, China denying there are talks, and tariffs that remain in place on most of the world.",Cdub7791,2025-04-28T22:45:32,38
"This whole thing is a fucking sham.  Gold dropped but our currency hasn’t recovered.   Gold was hitting record highs and retail was going heavy in Gold.  Now stocks are up and Gold is down, but with the currency issues the rises are little more than stacking Monopoly money.   There’s really no winning. Our currency dropped  when Trump was trying to be a bully and now it’s dropping because he simply looks weak.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-28T22:46:45,17
Gold is down like .5% today. It's still very neat it's all time high. What is this even?,kim_bong_un,2025-04-28T23:15:02,6
"Gold price always increases in a chaotic, weak economy. To be clear, gold IS high. Also, there is a relationship between gold and fuel prices. With fuel price increase come gold price increase.",rainbowshummingbird,2025-04-29T00:53:52,3

I need to go gold dredging again,Mebbwebb,2025-04-29T00:29:10,1
I mean gold didn’t really “drop”. It pulled back a little from its highs and is consolidating above $3300.,Agitated-Ad-504,2025-04-29T11:13:57,1
What a predictable twist in the plot. Idk who the writers are but they’re getting lazy.,Dear_Perspective_157,2025-04-28T22:42:26,0
Once the Q2 results are in and recession is officially declared then investors will flee the stock market.  Add to this a sliding USD and retreating bond market then they will have nowhere else to hide but gold.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T22:49:58,12
