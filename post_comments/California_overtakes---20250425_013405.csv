California gets roughly .95 back for every dollar they contribute to the federal government. That figure does not include purchases the federal government makes from in state businesses that would absolutely be shifted to other states should California leave.   Furthermore California would tank once the agricultural subsidies stopped completely and the tech industry started to relocate as Silicon Valley will be much more interested in US DoD money than what ever crumbs California can put together.   California will not fare as well as you think.,Elefantasm,2025-04-25T06:45:49,-1

"California's three top industries all see a lot of federal dollars that aren't subsidies so they aren't factored into how much CA gets back for every tax dollar gets paid.   When the federal government stops buying CA food sources and ceases any subsidy that sector takes a huge hit. California will not have the money to afford covering this loss makingCA foodstuffs pricer and less attractive than say Mexican foodstuffs.   When the tech industry realizes the department of defense dollars will dry up if they remain in CA they will begin to relocate as the DoD money is significant to many tech businesses which will gut CA's economy. The very large tech companies will no longer remain in CA and will relocate to retain that money.  Finally the higher education industry, which is a significant source of wealth, will have a rough time when subsidies and grant monies stop completely and no US federal aide can be spent in CA (currently most metrics assign the scholarships given to students as being ""spent"" in the state they reside rather than the school they actually attend there's enough federal scholarship money being used in CA schools that it is possible that CA gets more than it contributes)",Elefantasm,2025-04-25T07:27:04,1
"I was more thinking: what if the second biggest economy, China, is divided in a couple of parts. Than 1 part could be bigger than California. Maybe not that interesting to you or me, but maybe for China it is.   It could be that there is other stuff questionable in determining the size of California's economy here: I haven't looked at it in detail.   Let's keep it at that California has a very big economy, certainly relatively compared to (most) other states of the US. I'm guessing Texas also has a big 'economy', for example.",drawb,2025-04-25T12:06:33,1
"There‚Äôs a lot more to that, unfortunately.

Everyone would be hurt by CA leaving. They are important like TX and NY are to the whole nation. That being said anyone who thinks CA would have the 4th largest economy after leaving is deluded.

People seem to forget how easy it is to survive being homeless here compared to elsewhere with the wide abundance of resources. Let alone then you include the stable weather we usually get here. It's no wonder you'd see homeless from other states try to migrate here,bhsn1pes,2025-04-25T03:47:23,7

Then you have to factor the weather. Which plays a pretty key role along with our huge population here with our homeless problem.¬†,bhsn1pes,2025-04-25T03:45:21,8
Yes but CA might no longer be the best source as other states could provide them as could Mexico (presuming they trade with us still) .  CA farmers are getting preferential treatment because they are US businesses.   The other factor is the Colorado River which CA needs and the USA controls. CA could expect reduced access to that water.,Elefantasm,2025-04-25T15:50:44,1
"Yes, at every possible turn they will choose to support American businesses which will no longer include CA farms.  The tech companies will leave CA. There is far too much money in the DoD for the bigger players to consider anything else. Google isn‚Äôt going to find someone who can make up for the loss of the DoD contracts so it would make more sense to leave CA.   grant monies drying up means these schools are suffering already losing the scholarship monies would kill them",Elefantasm,2025-04-25T15:47:25,0

Do you need me explain why the US government purchases goods from US businesses whenever possible?    I did explain why tech would leave. Im not sure what a source for that would look like short of having you look through corporate budgets to see how much money these businesses get from the USA which again would be directed to other US businesses whenever possible. The DoD would prefer to not have any part of their tech that they are dependent on to come from foreign or non-allied sources.,Elefantasm,2025-04-25T16:25:19,1
