"Alot of our merchandise is made in China. Unless Trump can get this stuff from another country, he is going to have to get it from China. Trump wants the working class to pay for the ultra wealthiest tax decrease. Stop worrying about whether or not the richest people have enough money, it's not helping anyone.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-27T13:05:38,1

">“In game theory it’s called strategic uncertainty,” he said. “So, you’re not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you’re going to end up. And nobody’s better at creating this leverage than President Trump.”  Lol Trump has never consciously engaged in game theory. Trump doesn't even know where he's going to end up in terms of ""deals"". All he wants is something he can flash to the public and claim as a win, even if a week later he will call it a shitty deal and it will basically change nothing. See the USMCA for how this plays out,which was really just NAFTA 2.0 anyways.",PM_ME_UR_JUMBLIE5,2025-04-27T13:40:37,1

A path? I thought big bad Donny RageTweet was just gonna steamroll the Chinese with tariffs! This kind of talk doesn't support the President's policies. Has K-Tel sent FBI agents to the treasury secretary's home yet?,ZombiePartyBoyLives,2025-04-27T13:50:17,1
"Good luck.  You path seems to be flailing around wildly in the dark hoping to find a tree trunk with moss on it to get your compass bearings.

"They're very interested in negotiating with us, just not right now. They have Trump completely over the barrel, and they know it. They can let this ride until he's desperate to get something done. My money's on us having Chinese electric cars here with low/no tariffs on them within a year.",AnalTongueDarts,2025-04-27T13:10:25,14
"they actually have more advantage in the current blockade of the US. if they gain allies in this and there's no reason they won't because Trump has attacked all the friendly nations, they could facilitate the destruction of the US economy.",JaVelin-X-,2025-04-27T13:38:14,4
"Long term they might wait until the US midterms are done, getting Democrats control of Congress brings about some form of stability and ""adults in the room.""  Short term Trump might just cave on the entire thing and China ends up with a better deal than they had before as Trump goes full damage control.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-27T14:49:55,1

I feel like a 10 year old would at least try and do a better job running trade negotiations. 10 year olds would want to have the end goal of getting cool stuff in the country. Who the hell actually knows what the demented dictator’s end goal is with tarrifs?,greyhoundbrain,2025-04-27T13:36:19,2
"Probably because Trump didn't declare an ill strategised tariff war on China, he declared one on *everyone including allies of the US*... bar Russia and North Korea.   He then threatened to annex Canada, Panama, Greenland etc.. They're supporting China because if China wins, the likelihood of blanket tariffs for everyone dropping increases drastically. He's also less likely to be able to invade his allies, or have the political credibility to start shit like openly supporting Russia.   In short, Trump put everyone on the same side as China.",DireBriar,2025-04-27T15:02:34,3

"Fucking hilarious. Never thought I’d find myself rooting for the execrable Chinese government under any circumstances, but the United States desperately needs to be taught a lesson that the average disengaged citizen will actually *feel,* and painfully so. There’s no other way we’ll be able to learn.",GrafZeppelin127,2025-04-27T13:18:22,6
Well sure...once we're in ruins and Trump has to beg them for small favors they'll deal with us again. After China has taken our place in world trade and they're confident we'll never rise to that level again.,GigMistress,2025-04-27T13:49:28,2

Are you completely glossing over the fact that it's cheap slave labor  that you are willingly supporting?  Talk about cognitive dissonance,_Doomer_Wojack_,2025-04-27T13:43:00,-4
"Because they can both reap the benefits of Trump's damage to our trade relationships elsewhere in the world and to our economy *and* keep selling us a ton of shit if they don't just watch us drive off a cliff. They can watch us suffer a bit, which I think they will, and they can inflict more suffering by selling their USD and treasuries, and use those levers to get more concessions out of Trump.",AnalTongueDarts,2025-04-27T14:15:49,1
"Sadly, those of us who have been engaged and don't need the lesson will be starving right alongside them.",GigMistress,2025-04-27T13:50:08,3
"Calling it slavery is an insult to the actuial victims of slavery in the past and in the present day.  There's a concept called cost of living. Someone getting paid $4 an hour in another country is able to save or send money to their village back home. Meanwhile someone in the US making $15 an hour is living paycheck to paycheck and is more of a slave.  And the object of your boycott is to send the work to other countries that pay even less, so you really have no point here.  We don't have the supply chains, we don't have people willing to manufacture things. Gen Z doesn't want to work in factories.  you've moved the goalpost once. let's see you move it again with more of your ""no, it's others and the best economists who are wrong"" logic.",Rich_Housing971,2025-04-27T13:53:46,3
"They'd be better off just neutralizing the US economically. Business will always come back if you are cheaper no matter how bad you treat them..people not so much. Selling off US dept is too much an overt attack when the same results can happen by Trumps self inflicted chaos and not suffer backlash for causing the subsequent destruction.  This Trumps tarrif war and surrender in the soft power war are a gift to China and Russia..China could have been dealt with, they aren't necessarily crazy. Russia could have been dealt with just by turning Ukrakne into a fortress.",JaVelin-X-,2025-04-27T14:22:50,1
"While I understand your point about the term ""slavery"" and the cost of living differences, it's crucial to distinguish between low wages due to economic disparity and situations where workers face coercion, lack of basic rights, and unsafe conditions. Even if $4 an hour has more relative value in another country, that doesn't negate concerns about exploitation if those wages are unfairly low or if workers are being mistreated.   The goal isn't necessarily to bring all manufacturing to the US, but to advocate for fair labor standards and ethical sourcing globally, ensuring workers everywhere have dignity and safe working environments.  Your point about the cost of living is valid, and comparing wages directly can be misleading at best, and the whole generation z does not ""want to work"" is a generalization at best. If corporations paid a living wage and job security, there would be no issues finding workers.",_Doomer_Wojack_,2025-04-27T14:10:12,-2
">The goal isn't necessarily to bring all manufacturing to the US, but to advocate for fair labor standards and ethical sourcing globally, ensuring workers everywhere have dignity and safe working environments.  The fact that a giant country went from subsistence farming and is still growing is lost on you. If they stopped manufacturing there and just went back to farming, I can guarantee you that their lives would be worse.  You either don't understand how the world works, or you actually want to make their lives worse.",Rich_Housing971,2025-04-27T16:26:11,3
"I feel like the Khmer Rouge tried that already when they attempted to force the country back into an agrarian economy as part of their 'Make Angkor Great Again' plan, which didn't work out so grand for the Cambodian people.",nucknuckgoose,2025-04-27T19:44:46,2
