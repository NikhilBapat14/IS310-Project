"Some key historical reminders:  >Some see Ábrego García’s arrival in El Salvador as marking a new, dark chapter in U.S. history, but Washington has long supported and harnessed lawlessness in Latin America to pursue its own aims. > >Through the 1970s and 1980s, U.S.-backed anti-communist regimes “disappeared” hundreds of thousand Latin American citizens, engaging in a form of state terror traced back to Nazi Germany. El Salvador became infamous for such political “disappearances.” About 71,000 people, or between 1 and 2 percent of El Salvador’s population, were killed or disappeared. > >A key aspect of the terror, back then, was the not-knowing. Friends and families of “los desaparecidos” exhausted themselves dealing with labyrinthine bureaucracies. Government officials shrugged off their questions, telling them their missing relatives probably went to Cuba or ran away with a lover. > >Today, though, Trump, aided by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, feels no need for such evasions. The fuck-you impunity on display during Bukele’s recent visit to the Oval Office — “Of course I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said, when asked if he would return Ábrego García — is a higher order of terror, one meant not to generate doubt but to instill helplessness. > >... > >The movement to have Ábrego García returned, as is any effort to rein in the predator Trump administration, is inspiring. Yet all those deported to CECOT deserve our attention. The state crime isn’t that an innocent person was sent to CECOT in “error” but that anyone was sent there at all. > >CECOT, however, needs to be recognized as not an aberration in the history of the U.S. in Latin America, but an extension of it. Don’t, said Bertolt Brecht, romanticize the “good old days” when fighting the “bad new days” of fascism. That advice holds for the Trump administration’s efforts to use El Salvador as a receptacle for its cast-offs. > >Washington was deeply implicated in Latin America’s deep history repression, helping create a formidable system of death squads, death camps, and death flights — helicopters or planes that dumped political prisoners into the ocean to drown. > >... > >Then, as now, the complete absence of accountability wasn’t merely a common thread among U.S. partners; it was a basic condition for the partnerships. In Brazil, Uruguay, and elsewhere, the U.S. designs on dominance necessitated such brutality — just as in El Salvador today, where Trump seeks to leverage a massive detention center to create a destination for unaccountable mass deportations.  > >The gleefulness in which Trump, Bukele, and others in that recent White House meeting discussed their plan was horrifying.  There should be no illusions here that what's happening with El Salvador is in many ways continuing a long tradition of the US government not just tampering in the domestic affairs of Latin American countries, but also using them as a means to persecute troublesome US residents and citizens without accountability or oversight. This was problematic through the lens of history, but it's also problematic now.",Hrmbee,2025-04-23T08:55:05,5
It wouldn’t be the first time the US government ships off Latinos—American or otherwise—without due process. It’s a racist country that sees Latinos (both immigrants and citizens) as nothing more than pack mules.,Partitionbaby,2025-04-23T09:49:44,2
