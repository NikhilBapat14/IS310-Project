"Actually the last thing the world, especially America, needs right now is Iran with nuclear weapons.  For they WILL use them.",mdws1977,2025-05-05T21:11:29,62
">As pressure mounts for yet another regime-change war — this time with Iran — it is imperative that the U.S. resist calls for escalation.  **What I clicked for:** reasons **why** we *must restrain ourselves* when dealing with the #1 most hostile of all our adversaries. **What I got:** a few dozen paragraphs of *Trump-admin-in-general*, with a paper thin restatement of 'dont do this!' and then that's the end of the article. It reads like a giant checklist of names that have to be mentioned for an article to be hot enough for today's internet.  There isn't foreign policy in this text, there's just play-by-play updates narrating a camera focused on people *in this country instead of that one.*  >Yet under the growing influence of the more nationalist and non-interventionist America First movement, this longstanding alliance is beginning to fracture.  This does not influence my opinions on the ayatolah's revolution regime in one direction or the other, it just makes me begin to suspect the writer is mass-producing text that only needs to mass-produce clicks.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T21:14:48,32

All we'd have to do is fly a few B2 sorties and destroy Iran's uranium stockpiles and centrifuges. Israel would be glad to take it the rest of the way.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T21:20:44,21
"No, the last thing we need is Iran sneaking a nuclear bomb into Manhattan and turning New York into a radioactive death zone.  Don’t let members of a suicidal/homicidal cult have nuclear weapons.",Frescanation,2025-05-06T05:02:10,12

"*The last thing any nation needs is war*  Sometimes war is necessary, and even more rarely, it is justified.  But, there is no geopolitical situation that exists in the world today that necessitates America going to war, and there are even fewer geopolitical situations that exist in the world today where America would be morally justified in going to war.",Shadeylark,2025-05-06T07:28:30,2

"**IRAN CAN NOT BE A NUCLEAR POWER**  It’s non-negotiable.  Also, the article is to the Federalist, that links to Newsweek as a source saying Tulsi said Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons, but that’s not what she actually says in the video - she said the **IC (international community)** has not assessed that Iran has developed nuclear weapon weapons.  That’s some very squirmy language, I would guess purposefully.  Not hammering Tulsi, I’m saying her wording seems to be walking a tightrope.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T21:15:54,28
"Le sigh... No they won't.  Nukes are like hostages; they're only valuable as a threat.  Iran doesn't want nuclear weapons to use them, because they know that using nuclear weapons would trigger a nuclear response.  Iran wants nuclear weapons to ensure that they can stretch their strength around themselves without the threat of America smacking them down.  Iran wants to be able to do what Russia is doing right now, where they can invade neighbors confident that because they have nukes America can't come running in with guns blazing to save the day.  **Nukes allow Iran to give America the middle finger without having to worry about America smacking them down.  That's why they wants nukes.  It's not about using them, it's about being able to do what they want without America being able to do anything about it.**  Iran without nukes can't get too froggy or else America will do to them like we did to Iraq... Iran with nukes can get froggy and the most we can do to them is what we're doing to Russia now.  That's why Iran wants nukes, and that's why we don't want them to have them... It is not because they'll use them... It's because if they have them we can't use our military against them.",Shadeylark,2025-05-06T07:34:28,5

">All we'd have to do is fly a few B2 sorties and destroy Iran's uranium stockpiles and centrifuges.   It would take most, if not all of our B2s, and two carrier groups including their subs at a minimum.  It would also take just over half of all of our deep penetrating munitions.  It would be the biggest naval action since the first Gulf War, going up against drones and modernish air defenses.   >Israel would be glad to take it the rest of the way.  Israel does not have the capability to do what is needed.  They do not have enough planes, enough of the correct non-nuclear munitions, and definitely not enough air refueling capabilities.  They could hit one site.  Maybe two.  Iran watched what happened when Israel removed Iraq's nuclear program.  Their sites are spread out and buried deep.  Either way the US would then have to spend billions and billions on air defenses to protect them.",cathbadh,2025-05-06T09:35:11,3

"Israel has already destroyed Iran's air defense capability, hitting multiple targets in one day. Furthermore, we have 6 B2s at Diego Garcia capable of carrying enough GB 57s to knock Iran's nuclear ambitions back to the stone age.

Of course it does.  If they were not they'd have already incinerated themselves against Israel.  Instead they've been very careful not to provoke the Israelis enough to wipe them off the planet.  The leaders of these nations are not the same as the fanatics that strap bombs to themselves; they have a sense of self preservation in spite of their radicalism.,Shadeylark,2025-05-06T13:42:26,0

"> Israel has already destroyed Iran's air defense capability  The majority, yes, but look at any analysis of the situation and you'll see that they still have more than enough to be dealt with separately before attacks commence in full.  >hitting multiple targets in one day.   Yes, they can hit multiple air defenses in a day.  They cannot hit multiple nuclear facilities in a day.  It isn't a knock on them as a country, it is the reality of having X planes, X-Y planes that can be up at a given time, and Z ground penetrating munitions.  Israel doesn't have enough quantity of everything they would need.  >Furthermore, we have 6 B2s at Diego Garcia capable of carrying enough GB 57s to knock Iran's nuclear ambitions back to the stone age.  Again, it would take at least half of our bombs to do it.  Each bomb dropped there is one not available for China or anyone else causing trouble.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be worth it, just saying the cost would be significant.  Also, the B-52s aren't going in unless we are carrying out a multi-day campaign.  Each extra day is a day that Iran can ship nuclear material out to be used in dirty bombs or to be used later in a reconstituted program.  >In addition, with CSGs 1 and 8 already on station in the Middle East combat air support would not be a problem.  If I wasn't clear, I'm well aware the US can do it.  It will cost us tens of billions in striking, and then tens of billions more shooting down every single missile and drone Israel and its proxies have, which will be launched at every ally of ours, especially Israel.  Again, every anti-air missile used is one not available later.  We can only build new ones so fast.  I'm not opposed to striking Iran's nuclear sites or even Iran in general.  They've FA'd nonstop for 20 years, attacking American forces, American civilian shipping, and all of our allies.  There's more than enough justification for FO.  I'm just saying it will be a complicated and expensive process that will 90% be on our shoulders.  It will also probably draw us back into the Middle East for another decade of having to deal with trouble.",cathbadh,2025-05-06T13:04:30,1
"I get what you're saying. Sure, it would cost a lot of money. And yes, it could get pretty complicated. But the bottom line is that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. If necessary, Israel would go it alone, whether successful or not. They'd have to, they stand the most to lose. And the last thing we need is for Israel to feel that their very existence is threatened because I'm pretty sure they'd initiate a first strike on Natanz or Isfahan if they believed we wouldn't help. Then we would all be well and truly fucked.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-06T19:19:39,1
