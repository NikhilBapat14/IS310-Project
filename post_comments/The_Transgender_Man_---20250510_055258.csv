Discharging honourable members of service because of gender identity is shameful. These are people who are willing to fight and die for their country when so many others are unwilling to do so. Shame on the US government!,thewanderingent,2025-05-10T11:25:20,1

"In my humble opinion, the issue of transsexual rights moved too far to the militant group demands  and as a result, the push back as a result is harming citizens like this soldier.  I dare say, if one even dares to question trans  rights or ask for clarity on issues, one is branded as ""transphobic"".   This is the other side of that coin.",Kooky-Language-6095,2025-05-10T14:36:50,1

"Military service is an obligation. The country cannot function, under any administration, without a fully staffed, functioning and capable armed forces. Donald Trump needs a military every bit as much as Bill Clinton did. In fact, we never should have ended the draft. The Army coming up short on recruiting is a national black eye. That 76% of men 18-26 are unfit for military service is a national disgrace. With a draft, taxpayers wouldn’t be paying new enlisteds $28k plus quarters, subsistence, training, transportation and other allowances.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-10T12:49:37,1

that’s a big no from me.  I barely can stand what this country has become.  There’s no way I would enlist or be forced into conscription to fight for the likes of white nationalists and fascists.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-10T13:55:11,1
"Respectfully, fuck that. I’m certainly not one of those “fuck the military” people, but I also recognize the fact that I am not the type of person that any branch of the armed forces wants protecting our country. I feel much more comfortable with people who *want* to enlist joining than for people like me being *forced* into it because of “obligation”.",zeldamaster702,2025-05-10T13:45:04,1
lol nah fuck that. america can suck its own ass. I’ll never fight for this country again I am in no way obliged to serve in the military because I was born here. fuck that shit all the way around. simpletons ideology,sshmage,2025-05-10T13:58:00,1

"Well the sad truth is that grown men don’t have the maturity to do what’s right. When I was in the Navy I met a lot of good people, but there’s a lot of people I wouldn’t trust if Trump ordered them to go into an ally country or hurt civilians here in America.  How can you say that men need to have the maturity to serve in the armed forces if our chain of command is currently deporting sick children and talking about overtaking other countries?   I think people realizing that this country is currently not doing the right thing and not wanting to serve is perfectly valid.",IDontKnowTBH1,2025-05-10T15:36:34,1
"And what, pray tell, is the job that “needs to be done”? We aren’t(or at least we *shouldn’t* be) some militaristic warmongering state where the only purpose that men serve is to “protect the people by any means necessary, even at the expense of their lives.” Even if 76% of 18-26 year old men are “unfit for service”, I feel more comfortable with the 24% who are that volunteer their services rather than the idea of forcing people to BE comfortable with it. For that matter, this whole conversation seems centered on the idea that it’s the male responsibility to do all this, yet I would feel equally comfortable with ANY person, be they man, woman, or WHATEVER gender identity, who WANTS to enlist.  All I’m saying is if a majority of that 76% are people like me(and I’m too old to be drafted anyway), you are going to have a LOT of conscientious observers that end up costing more money than it would to put aside this ridiculous fear that women and transgender individuals are incapable of serving in the military.",zeldamaster702,2025-05-10T15:48:44,1
It literally does not matter. A dishonorable discharge isn’t governed by the president or secretary of defense. You can’t just pass them out. Your lack of knowledge is showing,Cant_fly_well,2025-05-10T13:36:00,1
"Every job that is created needs to be done by someone. That’s essential to capitalism. Where these are poorly paid or in poor conditions then mature, self-disciplined men need to step up and do them. In effect, one and a half million people need to work at Walmart, another two million at Amazon and so on without regard to pay and treatment. As I was taught by a recruiter many years ago, a portion of the population, and I include myself in this group, needs to understand that what we think, believe, want or feel doesn’t matter. Those are just distractions and emotions that can be ignored if you have enough discipline.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-10T16:28:03,1
"For all those reasons and many you didn’t mention, I truly believe whatever version of capitalism that rules the world needs to die. My worth is greater than just settling for this bare minimum that you people should just “step up and do”.   As for whoever told what you think, want, believe or feel doesn’t matter, that person has either been lied to or was lying TO you.",zeldamaster702,2025-05-10T16:38:39,1
