"The Speaker of the House is elected by a majority of the House. If the party flipped in the middle of the term, the Speaker would still be the speaker, but the now majority party can push a vote on the Speaker and elect someone else.  So to answer your question, the Speaker is the Speaker for the length of the term unless voted out. So if the House flipped, the new majority would likely call a vote for a new Speaker, but COULD leave the Speaker in place.",ProLifePanda,2022-09-02T08:33:27,2
