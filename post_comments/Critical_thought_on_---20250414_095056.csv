"I hate how we have allowed our government so split spending and the funding into separate battles.   The CR/Debt Ceiling is arguing over paying for money already obligated in the budget bill, which itself is devoid of the funding for said spending.   It is like arguing over the credit-card bill you and your wife ran up while on vacation.  Edit: if they need to be separate battles, then the funding shuld be the first battle, and the spending shuld be constrained by the funding",Racheakt,2025-04-14T10:50:35,161
"I'd like to see more actual bills being written and signed. I know the majorities in congress are slim and so that is hard to do but you can only get so far with executive orders. If the Democrat presidential candidate wins in 2028 they can just sweep all those orders away on day 1.  I think the Laken Riley Act is the only major legislation that Trump has signed so far? It's still pretty early into the administration but we don't have forever until the midterms, especially if the house is going to be lost which is looking likely congress has gotta wake up and step up their game.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-14T18:31:11,45

"HOW is the signal leak a non-story?? Top-level officials are using a means of communication that is not approved for that level of information, with an incorrect retention policy versus what is mandated by federal law. They have probably been using it for far longer than we've known about and the only reason we found out is because of the Atlantic.   Imagine if a more sensitive operation was discussed, or crucial political moves, and one of the group participants' devices was compromised. All that information regardless of Signal's encryption would be out. Service members that mis-use communication lines get court martialed, the same standard MUST be applied to top-level officials or infosec as a whole is a complete joke.",capSAR273,2025-04-15T08:59:26,23

I expect we don't know the full story on many of your concerns and the likelihood of getting an honest appraisal of what is going on from the MSM are slim and none. '  As for the budget process. We were 4 months into the 2025 FY before Trump was even inaugurated. Trying is rescind spending authority while the US Treasury is already cutting checks is a heavy lift. I have no doubt that a rescission bill will be brought soon as part of the Budget Negotiation process for the 2026 budget which is what Congress is working on. Spending will be cut as a result of DOGE as well as the effort to cut spending going forward. We ahave not had a Regular Order Budget process for at least 28 years.

">Alexa, how many days have elapsed since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second administration?  >As of today, **Donald Trump's second administration is on its 84th day**.  Calm down and be patient.  It seems like a lot has happened since he was sworn in (and it has) but let's all acknowledge that he's not even to the end of his first hundred days in office yet.  Further, Patel was sworn in on February 20 and Bondi on February 5.  The FBI and DOJ respectively SHOULD operate without significant interruption despite who heads the agencies but that would be assuming that the Biden versions of those bureaus had existing investigations running.  I would be unsurprised to discover they did not.  If not, the investigations into figures like Mayorkas, Fauci and the rest...those investigations, at best, started less than 6 weeks ago.  And if there's one thing you want to make damned sure of before you issue an indictment for politically charged cases like these: your case better be better than a slam dunk.  It had better be Superman level bulletproof...and that takes time.  Relax and trust that the process is being pushed forward now by people who want to see justice done.  The evidence of crimes needs to be there, be unimpeachable and be damning.  Just because we've read reports in the media doesn't mean the info we have is of courtroom quality much less of conviction quality.",Euroranger,2025-04-14T11:43:19,0

Bad faith actors working for the left.  Not-quite fellow conservatives, who aren't working for the left (at least not directly or intentionally, even if their actions tend to result in the advancement of leftist goals), but whose loyalties lie with establishment orthodoxy.    These ones can be good faith actors when they are open about their intentions, but are bad faith actors when they pretend to be aligned with maga.  Think... Romney as an example of the good faith version of this conservative, and Nikki Haley as an example of the bad faith version.  The good faith version is a problem only insofar as their ideas are inimical to the current goals of the majority of Republicans and the current administration.  The bad faith version is a problem not only insofar as their ideas are obstructive and harmful to the goals of the voters and administration... But also in the deceptive way they go about undermining those goals.  Then there are the legit cultists... The people who think Trump is the second coming.  These people give us all a bad look.

DOGE is finding stuff, And now we gotta have some patience for a case to be built bc it's not just linear ""1+1=2"" when the courts are involved. Any slight misstep will end with them not being convicted bc the courts are heavily biased in their favor yet people expect instant results, That's not realistic if we truly want accountability.  I know its frustrating, I hate seeing them get away with all the shit they get away with, And its been happening far too long w/o consequences but we gotta be on the long game if we wanna actually win vs hollow victories/semblance of winning.

The only way anyone could possibly believe she did not make these trades based on her privileged access to information would be if she had declared ahead of time the intent to make those trades.

This is literally the opposite of ""Inside information"" when he tells the world on social media to ""Get it while its hot"".  Not to mention the fact that tariffs last like a week as far as the market dropping, And anyone with a brain would've bought all they could while it was down, knowing it would rebound sooner than later. Anyone who thought it was actually gonna collapse is a dunce.

"Hmm, I think you fell into a trap here.  You were lured in with what appeared to be a good faith discussion about one thing, the time it takes to process going after the bad faith actors... When the reality is that the person you're talking with never had any intention of having a good faith discussion about that topic.  He was never here to have a good faith talk about the process... He was always here in bad faith to attack mtg (or more likely, any outside the establishment, anti-orthodoxy Republican that he could create an attack vector against), and he was just using your good faith about wanting to talk about the process in order to create an opening for him to make his bad faith attack.  The dude you're talking with here really never had any interest in talking about the difficulties in the process... His intent from the start was to make this a discussion about how he believed, prior to the application of any process, mtg is a bad faith actor.  He just needed to find an opening by appearing to be reasonable about one thing that was unrelated to the attack he really intended on making from the start.  This is the same tactic the left uses all the time.  It's not quite a bait and switch, but it's dam close.  Don't fall for it.  Edit: side note... I would be extremely wary of anybody who labels themselves as an independent conservative who makes it a point to attack conservatives who are outside the establishment orthodoxy.  The entire idea of being an independent conservative is that you don't agree with the established orthodoxy.  Independent conservatives who carry the water for those defending the orthodoxy need to be questioned; why are the people supposedly against the orthodoxy of conservative thought working to strengthen the orthodoxy by undermining the anti-orthodox conservatives?  I would conclude that they are either orthodoxy supporting conservatives masquerading as independents... Or they are lefties who support conservative orthodoxy because they know the orthodoxy is no threat to their goals.  Either way... They're not acting in good faith as they are hiding their true intentions behind a mask whose only purpose is to deceive.  So again....be wary of any independent conservatives... Of course there's always the chance they're just bad communicators, but all too often bad communication can serve as the perfect cover.

"My comment was absolutely not in bad faith.  You can take your ad-hominem attack and shove it where the sun can't shine.  And FU for attempting to gaslight me on my positions/beliefs.  I'm simply stating that *anyone* in government who is making market trades and who has access to privileged information should be scrutinized the same as any other person with insider information.  Elected officials have an obligation to hold themselves to a higher standard than the average individual.  MGT appears to have done exactly this, simply based on the specific trades she made and the timing of those.  If I missed that she had declared intent to make those trades beforehand, please provide that evidence.  Pelosi is an obvious example of someone who has so clearly traded on insider information over the years, and Pelosi absolutely is NOT the same as MGT -- that is not what I stated.  If you feel inclined to defend these practices when they are executed by those on 'your team', then you are choosing to participate and defend the corruption that conservatives supposedly claim to be fighting against.

Its mostly leftist that engage this way, But you do see some of the TDS RINO types that still try to pretend they are actual conservatives. Personally I have more disdain for them then I do leftists. Leftists are usually just idiots, RINOs are often people that are pissed bc Trump remade their papa's party into something better, And more widely appreciated. I never liked the slimy Romney/Cheney types, And I like them even less now so I get what you mean on the ""independent"" conservative. For me, When I hear ""independent"" I see one of two things:  1- Someone who isn't really tuned in to things in the political space, But tries to be a bit more fair minded. I understand that some don't like to get into the weeds, And don't wanna ""dive in"". Rare these days though(Nieve too imo).  2- The more likely of them is the cowardly/spineless ""centrist"" which I have zero respect for bc they like to play the middle rather than actually stand for what's in their heart or they're just pretending to be reasonable in order to make an attempt at swaying you toward their nonsensical positions(As you said, Likely this person here fits into this category).   Either way, You'll get the bad faith, Idiocy from this group once they see you aren't a sheep to be herded, That you think for yourself w/o need of the hivemind to form your opinions. I respect a person with convictions, And consistency regardless of their leanings. I also have equal contempt for people that lack any principles, consistency, or conviction.   I hate when people use deception in order to win, And its probably the most toxic thing I see in politics these days imo. Unfortunately the leftist MSM operatives only have deception at this point bc their positions are mostly indefensible otherwise. Lying by omission, Framing, etc is all they have. Its ridiculous.",jeepgrl50,2025-04-15T12:12:22,2
"Yeah, if you'd said ""anyone"" rather than targeting a specific individual, I'd believe you when you make that claim.  If you'd continued talking about the process I'd believe you.  You specifically shifted this to target one specific individual though; nothing about the abrupt shift you made midway through says ""unbiased""  You honed in on her specifically like you had an axe to grind... And you're continuing to do so right here.  That's not a good faith argument; that's disguising your true intent.  As for ""being on my team"" you haven't done anything to prove you are on my team.  Hell, maybe if you'd shown your bias the other way you'd have more of a leg to stand on for ""being on my team"" but you couldn't even manage that despite ample opportunities.",Shadeylark,2025-04-15T11:02:33,1
"Maybe I specified MGT because she specifically was noted as making very specific trades on stocks very specifically impacted by pending Tariff changes before those actual policy changes were made public.  She's probably not the only one, and I never claimed she is/was.  If this is the only occasion vs if it becomes a pattern as it tends to do with many public officials then there is/will be no ongoing issue.  Time will tell.  Use your brain dude.  I have absolutely nothing that I need to 'prove' to you.",Slartibartfastthe2nd,2025-04-15T11:07:38,1
