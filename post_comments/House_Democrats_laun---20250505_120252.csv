"You’re dodging. The claim was that Clinton intentionally depressed wages in Haiti. You have no clear evidence for that — and you’ve conceded as much by pivoting twice. If you want to argue about U.S. imperialism or bipartisan corporate policy, fine — I’m game. But don’t move the goalposts just because the WikiLeaks cable doesn’t say what you hoped it did.

Noone said to feel sorry for her? Just that if he's actually did anything illegal she would've gotten in trouble unlike current Republicans. And your wording implies she did something illegal which dozens of investigations have deemed that she didn't.,UngodlyPain,2025-05-05T15:34:50,8

"The US state department is a bit more consequential than Amtrak ;)   And I wasn't the one to bring Clinton up. I wonder, why was she brought up? What does she represent to this person who mentioned her? Merely a rule-following bureaucrat? She hasn't held public office for nearly a decade. When you want to draw attention to the hypocrisy and lawlessness of the right, you would contrast them with a figure who was punished in some way, right? Maybe not a hero, but someone who stood for some kind of principle and suffered even a little bit for it?",Then-Pay-9688,2025-05-05T15:19:37,-5

You're talking about a man who wants to be a dictator, who wants total oligarchy and mass liquidation of the working class on an unprecedented scale. Under such circumstances, yes, you need heroes.

"For things where the crime is a fine or something? Yeah that's totally true. But my dude they literally chanted lock her up on national TV, with some people who are part of the current administration (and even part of signalgate) implying capital punishment was due,  you're kinda just perpetuating propaganda. She didn't get punished because she didn't commit crime, she also is rich and could avoid many sentences for certain crimes easily, but that's not what happened in many cases for her, she was just genuinely not guilty of most of what she's been accused of... Unlike her accusers with things like signal gate.",UngodlyPain,2025-05-05T15:42:33,7

"Yes this is concerning by itself. Full stop.   Furthermore, it makes you wonder how fucking bad the other option was that people chose *Trump* over it. You’re fooling yourself if you think everyone that voted for Trump are the crazies that think he’s a demigod and the election was literally stolen from him. That’s maybe 10-15% of America. Maybe 50% of his voters. But the other half held their nose and voted for him. Democrats, ask yourself WHY.

Ok that’s fair. Everything you said is *real*. I’m not saying they’re not. But to say those are why she lost is wrong. A better platform is the giant glaring issue and people say oh it’s cause she was black. Sure there were more than 0 people who voted the other way because of that but it’s a fallacy that that was *the* issue. And a fallacy that will hurt the democratic party’s chances of improving.,StopAndReallyThink,2025-05-06T13:15:27,1
