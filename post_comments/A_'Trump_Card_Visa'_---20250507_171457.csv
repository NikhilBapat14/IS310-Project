"Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has started rolling out digital infrastructure for a new golden visa immigration program, according to sources familiar with the matter, public records, and tests conducted by WIRED. The White House has yet to formally announce the initiative, but some US permanent residents and foreign visitors are already being asked if they have applied for a “Trump Card Visa.”  President Donald Trump first floated the idea of creating a $5 million golden visa in February, describing it as a way for wealthy individuals to buy residency in the United States and a pathway to becoming US citizens. How this would work is unclear: Federal law dictates how many permanent residency cards can be issued each year and who can get them, and experts say Congress would need to pass new legislation to raise the cap or change eligibility rules.  DOGE’s involvement in the visa project shows how quickly Musk and his team have expanded their purview. Trump’s initial executive order creating DOGE tasked the group with boosting government productivity by ""modernizing federal technology and software.” Less than four months later, DOGE appears to be playing a central role in shaping the American immigration system.

This whole thing is just so embarrassing and tacky,Cactusfan86,2025-05-07T17:26:48,8
Trump called it a trash can. They want 5 million from you to live in a “trash can”.   Not hyperbole.  You want more Andrew Tates? That’s how you get more Andrew Tates.,LuvKrahft,2025-05-07T17:22:14,7

"What a damn clown. Everything that’s wrong with America in a short article. Buy your way in. If you can afford $5 million, I don’t want you around me or my kids. You don’t make that much money being a good person. This is a guaranteed way for them to actually be “not sending their best”. A DEI program for the rich and powerful. The ones that don’t need it.
