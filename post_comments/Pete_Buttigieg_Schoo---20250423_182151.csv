"The problem of ""trust the process"" is that you can never disprove it before it is too late.  ""Trust the process! The tariffs is good, it will bring back job""  And until we hit great depression, this above sentence would always stay true.

"It felt like at the end he was just asking for Pete to come up with a bunch of false promises, which is exactly how Trump wins.   The difference is that Pete (or Kamala etc) aren’t going to tell lies to get the vote.

Caught part of it and maybe Pete could win if he keeps it up. But he has to basically be campaigning to get past being gay from now until 2028. Republicans will bring up him being gay and many are homophobic.,ianrl337,2025-04-23T18:41:03,9
Why can’t Pete just be president Pete. America would be so much better off.  I mean we’d be better off with a used diaper as president but you get the point,Wonder-Machine,2025-04-24T02:02:38,5
"This is exactly what is needed! These spaces are starting to get stale we need to get new air in. Pete is going to cut his teeth on the bro pod network and if he can win them over its an absolute game changer.   I’m going to say something unpopular and say that these brocasters are not awful people, they are just misinformed by the twisted online media. As much as you may not like it, these guys have enormously high trust levels amongst their listeners.   Also unlike Fox News, they have an independent listener base of non political people as well as their more right wing listeners. The reason they all shifted right in the first place is the right wing embraced them while the left shunned them. These podcasters brought a lot of people, young men in particular, with them right, but they can just as easily pull them back to the left.",KindaStableGenius,2025-04-24T01:56:07,2

"Goddamnit I can’t believe you got me defending this fuck head Shultz. What he’s talking about is essentially Dem “messaging” and its admittedly been on problem on the left for a while even by those on the left.   Pete did a great job explaining a vision but that’s insanely difficult to get all of that in a slogan or bumper sticker that resonates with voters.  To your point that Dems won’t lie to voters about what they can deliver to lock in their votes I agree. However, those days are past us. We can either take the high road and not “over promise” to voters or we can continue to get trounced by MAGA messaging and their co-opting of the SM algorithm.",RizzardOfOz76,2025-04-23T21:17:23,13
"Yeah, the simple and stupid rhetoric is what makes the Trump campaign so effective in its messaging. ""Build a wall!"", ""Lock her up!"", ""MAGA!"", are all effective because its so simple to digest. It takes the complication out of the world. You don't like immigrants? Lets just build a wall! Simple, easy, effective messaging.   People want simple, easy answers to complex problems that we all face today. If the solution can't fit on a bumper sticker, they don't want to hear it and until people can wrap their heads around the idea that life today isn't so simple, Democratic messaging is going to fail at every turn.",barlow_straker,2025-04-24T06:32:45,1

"I agree. . . but it’s honestly incredibly hard to do in a way that adds value when the interview is outright hostile.  You have to more or less be a talented genius public speaker, and incapable of being rattled by interruptions and bad faith.

"He did a great job. Pete really is one of the best communicators in politics, period.   Being able to get on a show like that and have an authentic conversation full of both laughs, personal experiences/connections, and real, important conversations about the issues, it goes a long way to breaking into those spaces. I actually really enjoyed listening to it, even though I don’t typically have any interest in listening to these guys. They did seem genuinely excited to have Pete on and to talk with him about stuff, so that’s nice to see too.  There are a lot of more uninvested folks, moderates, and even full on conservatives who watch to see exactly this kind of stuff from the dems. The party has been very slow to truly adapt to and embrace the modern age. It feels like half the time they still pretend like these online spaces don’t matter and don’t even bother to monitor it, let alone try to disrupt it. Most of the left/liberal leaning voices pushing back on their domination of the algorithms seems to be done by users rather than major political figures. That kinda speaks to the issues the guys on the pod were getting at as well.",nikolai_470000,2025-04-24T04:46:26,2

"Two reasons that makes me feel real frustrating.   One is they are saying this is a great experiment and we should give it time. Problem is we are not lab animals. Argentina got like 200% inflation and is much smaller, that's why they can take extreme approach. US is nowhere near that breaking point, and even Japan got 200% debt to GDP ratio and still are not doing anything this extreme. The US should not take place in some sort of economic experiment at the first place.  Second is the ""wait and see"" mindset that eventually everything would be alright. We have done that back in the 80s for the trickle down economy. 40 years later and they still using the same lie. And the most frustrating part is that we can never hold Trump accountable. By the time that everything falls apart, it would soon be the end of his presidency and he just gonna write pardon like crazy. So we basically in a catch 22.   You can't say he is wrong until he really messed up.   And by the time he really messed up, saying he is wrong is useless.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T07:54:03,2
"""Make up wild shit, and become just as flagrantly dishonest and untrustworthy as the Republicans"" is a crazy take.  America should not be in a situation where 'lie to idiots more effectively than your opponent"" is the winning strategy.",Sweary_Biochemist,2025-04-24T02:34:47,14

The america we all grew up with is gone, and gone forever. Most democrat representatives don't seem to appreciate this, even if their voters do. Republican voters actively celebrate it (because: idiots, mostly), but eventually even they will begin to appreciate quite how badly they fucked up. Too late to fix anything, but still. The US is in freefall, and it's not going to recover.  I think a better strategy at this point would be to figure out a plan for rebuilding from the ashes, working out what a post-trump america could conceivably be.
