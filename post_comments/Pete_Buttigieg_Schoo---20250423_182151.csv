"The problem of ""trust the process"" is that you can never disprove it before it is too late.  ""Trust the process!

As much as you may not like it, these guys have enormously high trust levels amongst their listeners.   Also unlike Fox News, they have an independent listener base of non political people as well as their more right wing listeners. The reason they all shifted right in the first place is the right wing embraced them while the left shunned them.

To your point that Dems won‚Äôt lie to voters about what they can deliver to lock in their votes I agree. However, those days are past us.

""Build a wall!"", ""Lock her up!"", ""MAGA!"", are all effective because its so simple to digest. It takes the complication out of the world. You don't like immigrants? Lets just build a wall! Simple, easy, effective messaging.   People want simple, easy answers to complex problems that we all face today.

"He did a great job. Pete really is one of the best communicators in politics, period.   Being able to get on a show like that and have an authentic conversation full of both laughs, personal experiences/connections, and real, important conversations about the issues, it goes a long way to breaking into those spaces. I actually really enjoyed listening to it, even though I don‚Äôt typically have any interest in listening to these guys. They did seem genuinely excited to have Pete on and to talk with him about stuff, so that‚Äôs nice to see too.  There are a lot of more uninvested folks, moderates, and even full on conservatives who watch to see exactly this kind of stuff from the dems. The party has been very slow to truly adapt to and embrace the modern age. It feels like half the time they still pretend like these online spaces don‚Äôt matter and don‚Äôt even bother to monitor it, let alone try to disrupt it. Most of the left/liberal leaning voices pushing back on their domination of the algorithms seems to be done by users rather than major political figures.

"Two reasons that makes me feel real frustrating.   One is they are saying this is a great experiment and we should give it time. Problem is we are not lab animals. Argentina got like 200% inflation and is much smaller, that's why they can take extreme approach. US is nowhere near that breaking point, and even Japan got 200% debt to GDP ratio and still are not doing anything this extreme. The US should not take place in some sort of economic experiment at the first place.  Second is the ""wait and see"" mindset that eventually everything would be alright. We have done that back in the 80s for the trickle down economy. 40 years later and they still using the same lie. And the most frustrating part is that we can never hold Trump accountable. By the time that everything falls apart, it would soon be the end of his presidency and he just gonna write pardon like crazy. So we basically in a catch 22.   You can't say he is wrong until he really messed up.   And by the time he really messed up, saying he is wrong is useless.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T07:54:03,2

Republican voters actively celebrate it (because: idiots, mostly), but eventually even they will begin to appreciate quite how badly they fucked up. Too late to fix anything, but still. The US is in freefall, and it's not going to recover.
