It turns out that pivoting away from being the academic and cultural center of the world and trying to be a manufacturing hub during a time of rapid automation might not be the best play,piratecheese13,2025-05-08T07:38:02,30
"The proposed cuts to research could result in economic catastrophe on a similar scale to the Great Recession.  ""The president's proposed cuts are just that — proposals. It's Congress that actually sets the budget. But if lawmakers choose to follow Trump's budget outline, Ramaswamy [economist at American University] projects that America's future gross domestic product could be more than 4% smaller as a result of these cuts. That's roughly the size of the contraction experienced during the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009 and was the country's longest recession since World War II.",zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-05-08T07:36:36,9
"They express the following fantasy (before backing off and saying these cuts aren't a priority)...   > ""I think getting the federal money out of this — making these labs sing for their supper and get money from private entities that want to research things that are practical for people — I think is the better way to stimulate growth by far,""  The best US scientists resent this concept and will not work under private funding, at least not without private sector levels of compensation and profit sharing. And many will not do it at all; many scientists will not even do applied research for the government, let alone privately funded.   Instead, they will simply take their labs to other countries. Likewise, the best graduate students will not stay in the US to do a corporate-sponsored PhD. There is simply no compelling future for US science if this passes.",Jon3141592653589,2025-05-08T08:06:31,7
President Stable Genius is giving every American scientist the golden opportunity to work the production line in a sock factory,AcadiaLivid2582,2025-05-08T08:13:13,3
"Most researchers do it for their love of learning, working with a community of simultaneously competitive and cooperative colleagues, teaching, and the chance to have some positive social impacts. All this is about harassing new evidence and new ideas to challenge entrenched worldviews.  These are all values antithetical to MAGA.   The economic impact of research is real, but all those other positive impacts never get mentioned or discussed.",EricThePerplexed,2025-05-08T09:18:51,4
And the researchers will leave America and make groundbreaking discoveries in other countries who will then profit from the economic benefit of those discoveries  Trump is doing a great job of sabotaging/destroying American scientific leadership  I'm sure the midterms will reward him greatly for this brilliant strategy,ElPlywood,2025-05-08T07:41:27,2
It’s so stupid. Not just gdp ruining but strategically moronic - akin to eating the golden goose for lunch.  I was just watching some general talking about the Cold War. It was won by investing in science and technology. Things like stealth aircraft depend on infrastructure and long term investments before they can be imagined let alone be built. And with China charging ahead you REALLY want to fall behind? Seriously dim. ,sir_racho,2025-05-08T15:34:37,1

"It’s easily the most regarded play in the world. It will cost the billionaires so so so much.  Here’s a physicist explaining how we benefit from funding research, yes it’s properly cited. https://youtu.be/I6X-EbE_EGo?feature=shared",SpiritedEclair,2025-05-08T08:30:11,9
"Not only that, the best improvements came from long shots that private companies won’t fund.  mRNA vaccines are the results of a long shot from a Romanian researcher who was almost disgraced until it was proven that she was right.  Crispr/cas9, internet, and virtually everything meaningful was once a longshot. ",SpiritedEclair,2025-05-08T08:32:26,4
"> The best US scientists resent this concept and will not work under private funding, at least not without private sector levels of compensation and profit sharing  It's so, so, **so** much simpler than that: the private sector *does not fund or invest it* the basic research and institutional infrastructure that you need to even *get* to the place where you can start building applied technology.  And it's even worse than you state on education. Not only will we hemorrhage research and scientific talent to other countries - people who will likely never come back to the United States - there's also the secondary effect where brilliant students from abroad will never emigrate to the US. We poach quite a bit of talent from other countries. They'll simply stop coming to the US, further bolstering their mother country's innovation economy.",counters,2025-05-08T09:50:11,5

"Huge segments of research of direct benefit to commercial space have been conducted via an NSF->NASA->DoD->Commercial transition pipeline. Given the pace of external investments in the face of our lapse, the US will be visibly non-competitive before midterms. All for some fantasy of corporations owning intellectual property from the foundations, and for Elon’s obsession to build his tomb on Mars.",Jon3141592653589,2025-05-08T09:40:19,2
"Historically, the private sector did make considerable investments in fundamental research -- GE, RCA, Bell Labs. But that's long lost, except for tiny segments of high-reward applications development.  But let's keep going -- It is even worse, as top US students will be leaving the country for their education, and potentially never coming back. I have already started to plan that my children may need to plan to attend schools in Europe, Australia, or Canada. The possibility that the US would be non-viable as a provider for higher education, due to the lack of connection to fundamental research and key aspects of the humanities, was way, way outside of my risk management radar even a few months ago.",Jon3141592653589,2025-05-08T10:42:52,2

"Spot on. For what it's worth, I've already begun having the same conversation with my family, even though we're a long ways out from working on college plans with our kids. In fact - and this should alarm most Americans - pretty much everyone I know with advanced education / degrees tells me they're having the same discussions.",counters,2025-05-08T18:13:38,1
