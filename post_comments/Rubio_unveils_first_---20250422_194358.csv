"No president should be able to unilaterally change the government this much this quickly. I blame Congress, both dems and reps, for ceding more and more power to the executive over the last 70 years.",TimothyMimeslayer,2025-04-22T20:03:52,10

"""We trained hard - but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we were reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing, and what a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while actually producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization."" - Gaius Petronius Arbiter, attrib.",mrlr,2025-04-22T20:52:53,1
Guess who could do something right now?   Starts with 'R'.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T20:07:15,9
"The only reason any of this is happening, is Republican congress people being absolutely spineless. Trump doesn't have any of the authority he's been using, it's only being allowed because Republicans refuse to lift a finger to stop it.",CrashB111,2025-04-22T20:07:54,7
This is it. Any president could have come in and tried to pull this shit but our country was designed to expect other branches to hold others feet to the fire. Congress is just as much to blame for the crumbling of our democracy as Expired Fanta Face,susibirb,2025-04-22T20:19:43,3

Guess who didn't do anything 4 years ago to start purging the executive of power after trumps first term? Did they really think Trump was just gone forever or the Republicans just abandoned fascism?,TimothyMimeslayer,2025-04-22T20:09:21,-1

"Yeah, they were up by those mega margins and they could just ram filibuster proof legislation with super-friendly Supreme Court by their side. Right?  And you know those EOs are worthless as soon as the next guy comes in. And even so, Biden did sign a whole lot of them BTW.",boriskin,2025-04-22T20:30:31,5
