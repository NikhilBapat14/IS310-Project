"\>In California, 12.5 boys have Autism which also has the highest ‘vaccination rates’. The answer couldn’t be more clear.  Because as we all know correlation is causation /s. I'm in favor of looking deeper into vaccines and other forms of healthcare in order to ensure they are as safe as can be, but folks leaping to conclusions like this does no good.",Doctor_Byronic,2025-04-17T23:20:51,148
I’m a doctor. Vaccines do not cause autism. This is all so cringe worthy. All of these diseases that vaccines have kept away for decades will start to come back if this anti vaccine undercurrent continues to grow,SpiritualEqual4270,2025-04-18T12:37:17,85
"Can we not please. I’m all for cutting government spending and increasing health awareness but when you attack my family I need to take a stand. Plenty of conservatives have loved ones with autism and this won’t be a popular move. If you don’t want vaccines then make an argument for personal liberty and bodily autonomy, don’t turn autism into a boogeyman. It makes me sick the way he speaks about autistic children and he obviously doesn’t speak from personal experience. It’s tone deaf and will drive people away.",MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-18T08:06:24,115
"Imo I think the biggest cause of autism is gluing kids to a screen as a toddler.    I think there's an over diagnosis problem that stems from behavioral traits kids develop from excessive screen time. Kids stare at a screen, lose out on social development, and then have social behavior problems that get pegged as autism.",Opening-Citron2733,2025-04-18T10:22:16,12
"If you go browse the Reddit autism community, they are apoplectic with rage over the JFK, Jr. autism tweet. IMO, he was just making a generalized statement. He wasn’t claiming that ALL kids with autism are a burden to society.",EevelBob,2025-04-19T08:25:57,2

Criminal how this data has been suppressed.  I remember doctors telling me as a parent that there is no correlation between vaccines and Autism.  Who is to blame for this?,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-18T08:44:09,-4
"You need HC access to get an autism diagnosis. And also because virtually everyone’s getting vaccinated it’s a hard variable to regress. That being said, this is maybe the most looked at hypothesis and it keeps coming back nope in any real analysis. To the extent there’s more autism the obvious causes are:  1) higher parental age vs the past. Reliably causes autism.  2) maybe higher diagnosis especially of low end of level one asd - used to just say those kids were a little odd and they’d grow out of it / learn to compensate. There’s big incentive too because this diagnosis will get you an ILP and better eduction in public systems   3) persistent environmental toxins and possivle toxins that are so pervasive like microplastics. Vaccines are only given in small batches and have replaced infectious disease which is a lot more inflammatory. Measles or mumps can take months to recover from… and post viral syndrome attacking nerves is a thing that happens way more easily in natural disease than vaccines.   For all of this it’s important to understand the huge difference between level 2 and 3 autism and level 1. The vast majority of people at level 1 as a child will be doing pretty well by high school and often succeeding quite well as adults. 2 is more of a coin flip and 3 means they don’t. 3 especially is really really really hard for families.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T13:36:48,19
"Eh. Vaccines have expanded dramatically since I had my shots years ago and they do warrant an investigation. We're vaccinating for too many things now at once and they have not been as thoroughly vetted compared to the set we had at the turn of the century. Need to stick to the essential ones as mandatory and have the rest be optional whilst studies take a better look at them. That way we can get the anti-vaxers to take the damn polio, measles, and mumps vaccines so those child killers don't get a resurgence.  Because I agree that vaccinations are critically important, but I am incredibly concerned with how lax the studies and oversight over them has become. Covid vaccines have thoroughly shaken my confidence in the current oversight and approval procedures in place. They've just become ""settled science"" and any questioning of them is treated as heresy. There is no such thing as ""settled science"", especially with health care. Everyone should be in favour of ensuring vaccines are squeaky clean with no shadow of doubt over their efficacy. People used to trust vaccines, and now they don't. We need that trust back or people will throw the baby out with the bath water.",RossBot5000,2025-04-18T07:58:32,0
"So, doctor, what causes it?   The mom's diet, drug use, pollution exposure, obesity, etc???   Can that affect the brain development?   My niece was born brain damaged.  My sister was a drug user and my niece was diagnosed with autism.   ",Junknail,2025-04-26T08:31:22,1
"I keep seeing people saying that RFKJ is going to put all people with autism on a registry. I can’t find any evidence of that (apart from what is claimed in leftist media sources, which are not legitimate source for accurate information). Do you know of any sources that can either back up or refute this claim?",Turbulent_Beyond_759,2025-04-24T07:07:15,3
"Is there a correlation though ?   I think it’s great to question everything we are putting in our bodies. But the data isn’t there for vaccines causing autism.  With that said, let’s dig into it. Let RFK do his thing and I support him. But as someone who is medically trained, has a sibling who is a pediatrician and a kid with autism - we are asking these questions too and coming up short.  Vaccines are an easy target for people who can be taken advantage of, such as vulnerable parents.  Vaccines do not cause autism.",MapleMonstera,2025-04-18T16:57:37,19
