" ""No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a    playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned  the  phrase:  “The  first  thing  we  do,  let’s  kill  all  the  lawyers.”    WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,HENRY VI,PART 2, act  4,  sc.  2,  l.  75.   When  Shakespeare’s  character,  a rebel  leader  intent  on  becoming king, seeid. l. 74, hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of his plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding “\[a\]way with him,” referring to an educated clerk, who “can make obligations and write court hand,” id. l. 90, 106.  Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the path to more power.  SeeWalters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be “that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government”).""",Predator_,2025-05-03T13:20:20,238

Biden wasn't immune as the Supreme Court gave themselves the power to determine if a president's actions are official and get immunity. Do you think a Republican majority Supreme Court would have granted him that immunity if he did something they or their bribers did not approve?  That was another part of why people were pissed. The Supreme Court had given themselves power that the Constitution did not grant them.,theshadowiscast,2025-05-04T01:43:53,9
"No, he wasn't. The way SCOTUS threaded the needle with that ruling had Biden done anything they would have simply ruled it *not* an official act. If Trump does something they approve of no matter how illegal it will be deemed an official act.  They've effectively rewritten the Constitution in such a way that they (Or rather the judicary) alone can grant full immunity to a sitting President. A power SCOTUS does not legally possess by the way. This idea that the Constitution is whatever they say it is is itself unconstitutional but it doesn't matter if everyone abides by it all the same.",ManiaGamine,2025-05-04T04:08:43,8

That may well be true but almost everything I know about Shakespeare or the Greek or Roman classics I learned on my own. A week ago last Friday I attended a performance 12th night at Smith College in Northampton Mass because I happen to be in the area at the time for a pottery festival.    The failure of the American educational system is not that they didn't teach Shakespeare or Homer or Dante or Virgil. But that they don't create scholars who have the curiosity or interest to learn things on their own.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-04T07:41:57,0

Biden’s insistence on following norms and customs fucked us, and his desire to protect his legacy will go down in history as ironically burying his legacy as the one who let fascism take over under his watch.
