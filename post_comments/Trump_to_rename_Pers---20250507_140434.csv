"Not really sure what this accomplishes, I guess build better relations with the Arab countries bordering the gulf? The only renaming I understood so far was mount McKinley reverting back to its original name",just_one_random_guy,2025-05-07T14:35:40,7

Actually it hasn't been. It's went back and forth from that and the Arabian Gulf for a long time.,wv_lookin_around,2025-05-07T14:50:19,13
"Incorrect. Its been Persian Gulf for over 2,500 years. It was Pars Sea in older Persian inscriptions (550-330BCE). The ancient Greeks also called it the “Sinus Persicus” meaning “Persian Sea”.  Even during the islamic age, geographers like Al-Idrisi called it “The Persian Gulf”.",Pzcor,2025-05-07T16:18:44,24
