"While I appreciate the warning, most of us have eyes and ears and can see the DoJ no longer works for the people.   Her practically fellating him everyday is disgusting to witness.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-05-02T09:55:50,307
She lied in her confirmation hearing when asked whether she would obey Trump or the Constitution. I see the Republicans who confirmed her don't care because they're not pointing out that obvious lie.  I truly hope we survive this but I'm guessing we won't.,mhouse2001,2025-05-02T09:57:50,98

The worst part is actual law enforcement and lawyers who aren't corrupt are getting punished for doing the right thing after Trumps 1st term. There are just going to be a bunch of dirt bags left to run our federal legal system.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T10:04:09,31

Trump will just keep naming people to be subsequent AG's until the DoJ becomes his personal law firm.  It matters little whether it is Pam Bondi or some other rando on the Street.,thieh,2025-05-02T09:56:11,15
"This is one of the biggest betrayals of the executive branch in Trump v2. A minor APPEARANCE of impropriety on the part of the DOJ in 2016 was the catalyst for the Clinton email investigation going off the rails. Here we are in 2025 and Bondi is essentially Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer. In between, a whole generation or two of voters have grown up with zero understanding of how completely abnormal and utterly fucked it is for DOJ to be operating this way.  I think one of the big mistakes of Obama‚Äôs first term was not prosecuting some of the worst offenses of the Bush era. I don‚Äôt have much hope for it, but I‚Äôd really like a next president to somehow achieve some justice for these offenses.",eggoed,2025-05-02T10:43:47,12
