"> Most people are cruel and 100% selfish.  I don't think it's ""most people"" – but the cruel/selfish ones get our attention because they're so abhorrent, so loud, so smug, so terrible. So we think there are more of them than there really are.  I do think humans, on balance, are still pretty good. But we're in a global system that's letting the cruel types become more dominant, so that's what we need to fight against.   (This is also why sharing photos & reports of huge protests is important – for us to see that we're a big force, too.)",UltraFinePointMarker,2025-04-29T03:08:51,15
