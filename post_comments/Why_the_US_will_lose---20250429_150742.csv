"A lot of the raw materials my employer brings in have no US suppliers capable of producing the quantity we consume at any vaguely reasonable price.   We're bringing in from China and Japan because there's just no other option on the global market.  Tarrifs won't do anything there to benefit the country.    All they will do is bring our double digit gross margins into possibly double digit net losses unless we can massively increase prices.  Because a lot of our exports leave the country, we would likely lose a lot of customers if we surge prices to stay profitable.  Fuck.",TehWildMan_,2025-04-29T15:11:07,9

\>  Trump’s unreliable America is throwing away the assets it needs     And the allies it needs. Maybe he should have rallied allies against China instead of driving them towards it.,__dilligaf__,2025-04-29T15:29:25,5
"I don't think I've ever witnessed a president be so singlehandedly responsible for destabilizing the global economy.  It's also no surprise that Trump is trying desperately to blame these outcomes on anyone or any*thing* else but himself and his own actions and policies.  And policies, mind you, that damn near every economist warned us about. It's not like these were wild predictions either.  Current estimates show that a recession is around the corner, with real GDP growth for the first quarter coming in negative at -2.2 percent.  When Trump caved on his ""liberation day"" tariffs, he claimed that dozens of countries were coming to the negotiating table, when in fact, the current administration is struggling to make deals with these other countries, including Japan, one of our largest trading partners.  And let's be clear here, Trump didn't back down because these other world leaders were ""kissing his ass,"" he backed down because his policies are reckless and ill conceived, while he was likely being pressured by his advisors to pull back on some of these damaging trade policies. And by pressure I mean that his closest allies were probably pleading with Trump the same way a parent does when they're trying to get their child to eat vegetables.  No, these countries aren't kissing Trump's ass, they're being alienated and some are even being forced to take a harsher stance against the U.S. In other words, Trump is welcoming retaliation, which actually has the opposite intended effect when it comes to reducing the trade deficit.  And what's worse is that as Trump continues to escalate economic and diplomatic tensions between us and these other countries, they are being incentivized to turn to China! And believe it or not, China has their collective shit together and can weather the storm a hell of a lot better than we can.  And this has also turned out to be a massive failure because before Trump upended global trade, the US was in a much better position to economically isolate China!  This point needs to be emphasized over and over again. China's economy has expanded and grown at an exponential rate over the years. They have the means, the population, the resources, the bureaucracy, the workforce, etc, to win a trade war against the US nine times out of ten.  Now, keep in mind that Trump has still imposed sweeping tariffs on a wide range of goods, products and services from dozens of countries, while he continues to escalate matters with China one day, but backpedal on his policies the next.  He obviously never learned his lesson from last time. Because not only did Trump start a trade war with China during his first term, which led to harmful consequences for American businesses and consumers, but he also managed to increase the trade deficit at the same time.  But his supporters will tell you that this time it's different, even though he failed to balance the trade deficit last time when our tariff policies weren't as sweeping and haphazard as they are now.  They'll also explain that this is just all ""part of the plan"" to force other countries to start treating the United States ""fairly.""  Yes, the United States—which has spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of the current global trade system—is now the victim of the system it helped build in the first place.  I've come to realize that this talking point—which Trump uses to justify his reckless trade policies—is merely a broader representation of the right's insistence that they are being constantly victimized by the powers that be. Except in this case, it's on a global scale.  That being said, none of this has kept Trump's spokespeople from going to bat for him, claiming that he's playing ""3D chess""  while lying to Americans about the long term effectiveness of his ""genius"" policies. ""It's all part of the plan."" What plan? You've shown us that there is no immutable plan here, that there is no certainty or stability whatsoever, and that the current administration is entirely untrustworthy.  This is all while Trump continues to make allies of enemies and enemies of allies as he fails to follow through on his ""day one"" promises.  In fact, it appears that Trump is more interested now in readmitting Russia back into the international club, than he is committed to negotiating a peace between Ukraine and its land grabbing enemy, nay, *our* enemy.  And yes, the flagrant hypocrisy of Trump and his supporters has been on full display these past few months.  Where in the past they used the stock market, CPI data, consumer confidence, price increases, Fed announcements, etc, as major metrics for indicating that a democrat president was doing a terrible job with the economy. But this time around, they're bending over backwards to defend Trump while trying desperately to rationalize why poor economic trends and ominous predictions about where the economy is headed are no big deal.  What's worse is that most of the economic issues we faced under Biden were a direct result of the global pandemic and its reverberating shock on the economy. On the other hand, most of the economic issues we have today are the direct result of one man's actions.  And Trump is such a vindictive, insecure, pretentious idiot that he doesn't realize, nor does he care that his rhetoric and actions are having the opposite intended effect on the economy. He doesn't realize that threatening to fire Jerome Powell will force markets into a tailspin. He's even gone on national TV and admitted that he ""couldn't care less"" if businesses raise their prices!  All those people who claimed they voted for Trump because he's a ""businessman"" don't realize that Trump is indeed running the country like he does his businesses, straight into the ground...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-29T16:05:20,3

"Trump will leave behind a burning hole in the ground where our country used to be, and consider his presidency a success if he is a free man worth billions when it's all over.  He'll sacrifice anything and anyone that is not already his, as the cost of doing business.  Socialized losses, to the extreme.  The dude is high-risk gambling with *our* bank accounts and very lives but we won't see any of the returns.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-29T15:38:26,3
"Tariffs are not something to put on the table for trade negotiations.  Trump has shot his load at the global economy in the vain hope that nations will flock to him for quick and dirty one way deals. Ones which heavily favour the US and disadvantages the other parties.   At the same time he is eroding the tax base , the value of the USD and US treasury bonds.  Six time bankrupt felon Trump is pushing the US towards default and it will cause a global economic depression.  Even if he were to be removed tomorrow the reputational damage to the USA is such that it cannot be trusted.   The rest of the world is in the process of writing it off as a dysfunctional failed state. I doubt that there is any way back from this fundamental crisis of confidence.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-29T19:09:44,2
