"Alaska or Maine due to ranked choice voting. The two party system is maintained because of first past the post voting. I went to grad school for public policy (left the field at this point but learned a lot). I learned about Durveger’s law which posits that in political systems with single member districts and first past the post voting, two parties will always come to dominate. Small parties fail to win power and voters don’t want to feel like their vote is thrown away. This makes it difficult for third parties to gain a critical mass of voters and become competitive.  Alaska and Maine introduced ranked choice voting. This allows people to vote more based on their preference without being more beneficial to the party they are least likely to vote for.",Randy_Watson,2025-05-10T18:59:55,1
"A small one. Vermont already has the Vermont Progressive Party to the left of the Democrats, which has seats in the state legislature. The last Lt. Governor of Vermont is also a member. It's not outside of the realm of possibility that the party eventually gets a member elected to the House or Senate, I think.  I'd also wager maybe Utah. There may be an appetite for a conservative party catering to the Mormon community in opposition to the Trump-led GOP. The Mormon population of Utah already has more opposition to Trump than other Republicans elsewhere, and we've seen third-party conservative candidates with ties to Utah gain popularity there.",lionhearted318,2025-05-10T18:59:13,1
"Mathematically Rhode Island’s first district, followed by New Mexico’s second, would require convincing the fewest voters for a new party’s representation in the House. Wyoming for the senate. As far as city councils/mayors there’s any number of small towns/villages that could probably elect a cohort of popular locals as third party candidates. Again Wyoming seems like a likely candidate for bucking national trends.",Mrgoodtrips64,2025-05-10T19:41:44,1
Political parties need money.   A lot of it and they have to convince the donor glass that they're offering something better rather than rehashed failed ideas.,JKlerk,2025-05-10T19:43:06,1
You will never get a fair view in Vermont.  They report favoably on democrats and nothing else.  Maine maybe.  I would say you would want to take over Iowa or NH for the early primaries.,Lanracie,2025-05-10T19:00:32,1
