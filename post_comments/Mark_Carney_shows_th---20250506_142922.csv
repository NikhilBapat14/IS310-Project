"Oh - ""Grey Rocking"" is a means of dealing with a narcissistic personality.  .....and here I was thinking it to mean that Carney was navigating a sundowning geriatric.",Parking-Emphasis590,2025-05-06T15:05:56,58
What a cheesy mess that man has made of our nation's Oval Office.  It looks like an ogre sneezed gilt snot all over the walls.   Carney meets an actual carney and maintains his composure throughout it all. Impressive.,allenahansen,2025-05-06T14:36:23,45

"genx American here... I cannot even begin to imagine how Carney could contain himself in a room full of buffoonsüòÖ  Containing the urge to break out in riotous laughter...that dude acquired a lifetime of stories over the course of a couple of days.  Carney should have patted him on the head and gave him a Happy Meal.    Or maybe a box of paddle balls- Harumpf!  Xi be doing the same dude...  These luddites are getting spanked all over the globe...funny thing?    These people have zero idea how hard the world is laughing at them, ü§£.  Yes it's gonna hurt but I seriously think popcorn will be in order when it starts raining dimes in these illiterate jackasses",goderdammurang,2025-05-06T21:38:36,8
Hilarious to see the difference in what Trump supporters saw. They are saying he was strong and Carney was on his heels the entire time.,space_wiener,2025-05-06T22:36:47,9

"Trump‚Äôs posture was super weak.  Is his spine absolutely degenerating?  When they were standing, you could see that Trump was taller than Carney. Then they sat down and he was just orange mush.  Carney had the posture of a leader.   üí™üá®üá¶",lesmainsdepigeon,2025-05-06T18:39:27,2
"It doesn't work for everyone. Carney has a status and resume that, for someone as status obsessed as Trump is, will have a modicum of respect for. If a career politician or former drama school teacher tried this (such as Poilievre or Trudeau, for example), it wouldn't have the same effect.",bravetailor,2025-05-06T15:16:37,1

Watching him sit right there while Trump was talking about making his country the 51st State was surreal. Hats off to him for not walking out of there right in front of all the cameras. That was just obnoxious and disrespectful. Trump knows no one will walk away from the table when it's the US because there is a lot at stake. So he humiliates other leaders like the spoilt brat son of the CEO who bullies employees because he knows no one will give it back to him lest they get fired.,Bangers_n_Mashallah,2025-05-07T08:20:17,1

"I'm happy for you. Tbh, for him to maintain his composure for that is commendable. He would have been well within his rights to simply stand up and leave.  Im somewhat thankful he didn't actively attempt to embarrass Trump, and just let him do that himself. Their conversation made it quite obvious to me that almost any world leader could walk him into whatever they want.  Carney had several opportunities to just wholly embarrass and shame him in very sound biteable ways.  Him not doing that is also commendable.",jakktrent,2025-05-06T15:34:51,24

All the jabs at Trudeau for being a teacher shows just how much respect this profession gets in the North America... This attitude unfortunately contributes to our declining educational quality here :(,Regular-Improvement1,2025-05-09T19:25:15,1
