"Can he?  Yes.  The only requirements to run for office are outlined in the Constitution.  [Be 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen and have lived in the US for 14 years.](https://www.usa.gov/requirements-for-presidential-candidates)  Would he/would someone challenge him?  Almost definitely.  But that is a political/party question rather than a legal one.  Edit: As others have pointed out, I didn‚Äôt mention the term limits (2 terms) and the ‚Äúnot convicted of insurrection‚Äù. The latter, beyond the protestations of those who ignore the end of that amendment (Congress gets to define everything, basically), rarely even comes into play. And the former I just assumed everyone knew. Basically, so long as you fit all of that, you can run every four years if you like.
