"Everything they were promised failed to materialize : They still can't afford a house, prices are higher than before, girls are not suddenly attracted to them, they are certainly not richer, their lives still suck, their membership in MAGA has not made them powerful, they do not feel like the chosen ones and they have not risen as a group to become the rulers of everyone else.  They fell for the oldest trick of the trade; believing someone telling them what they wanted to hear, promising them wealth, power, sex and an easy life even if it was impossible.",Agressive-toothbrush,2025-04-30T13:33:50,963

"A point we need to hammer them on more is the fact that despite declaring himself as the avatar of hyper-masculine tough guys, trump is the opposite of all those things.  He spends all day whining and complaining about his problems.  He picks on people he sees as weak and cowers in the face of people he sees as strong, like Putin.  His movement is terrified of everything snd they think killer immigrants and pedophiles are hiding under every rock.  His ICE goons send a squad of 5+ to abduct grandmothers and school children.  They cover their faces and refuse show ID because they are scared.    Even on simpler bro type stuff, his immigration BS is going to make sports worse.  World Cup, Olympics, international NFL games, everything to do with the NHL, all of that can be negatively impacted by what he’s doing.  And just listen to him talk about sports, unless he’s talking about golf he truly doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  He’s like the Dumb old boomer that calls it “sportsball” and pretends to be interested.    Picking on vulnerable people isn’t tough or masculine.  And it certainly isn’t masculine to do that behind a mask.  Complaining about your Problems isn’t tough.  Harassing women and begging them to fuck you isn’t tough.    These guys aren’t tough and they aren’t masculine.  They’re really just a bunch of scared weak little cretins",Odd-Mode-4924,2025-04-30T14:42:25,10

"In this context, I'll posit for these dudes that Trump is the worst ""wing-man"" ever.  A major driving force for young dudes is finding a Mrs. - or many Ms.'s - since time immemorial.  For your intrinsic qualities - your personality, your intelligence, your spirituality - Trump is fatal. Everything he does and says is either practically or emotionally anti-women; and if you align yourself with that, women don't want anything to do with you.  For your extrinsic qualities - health & wealth - unless you're already wildly wealthy, Trump is the nail in the coffin for you. He's a disaster on the economy for anyone outside of the 1%, led the greatest loss of American civilian lives in history (COVID), and is empowering RFK to absolutely decimate all the programs that help Americans to be healthy. As a gross generalization, people don't tend to want to date sick and broke people.     Aligning with Trump means you aren't getting dates, you aren't getting married, and you aren't having kids = you don't have a future beyond your own family of 1. He's the worst wing-man you could ask for.",Terakian,2025-04-30T14:31:03,4

What alarmed me was that these young men seemingly had not concerned themselves with the impact on autonomy this would have to their sisters, mothers, and fellow classmates. How they did not understand that things were to be dismantled, intentionally. How education would be negatively affected potentially for generations to come.  How their own livelihoods could be forever altered in a negative way, and how they seemed so nonchalant about the implications of that.

"I think some caution should be taken here, we should take pause. People are getting overly optimistic about what this means. Sure, some of these young, male voters (overwhelmingly white) are going to become disillusioned with these types and ideologies pretty quickly realizing it is a facade and full of false promises and grifters. Most are just seeing this as Trump can't deliver on promises and once again, they are being rejected and denied their entitled lifestyle and future. The majority of these voters are not going to just unplug, reprogram and switch teams overnight. They're going to attach themselves to either a more extreme candidate or someone they believe can deliver what Trump failed to.   The problem isn't just Trump nor will it be solved by seeing this particular emperor has no clothes. The problem is cultural and where they are being influenced. The ""manosphere"" bullshit and intersectional communities like Joe Rogan and other podcasters/influencers are the cultural nexuses where they are being driven to vote like this and view the world like this. We need to have some sincere reform to our media sphere to quell these sources of malignant influence as well as classify the ""manosphere"" bullshit as hate speech. There needs to be some legal consequences to these culturally influential sources or else these young men, who often think themselves invulnerable and have not yet had the reality of time and the world come down on them, will not be shaken and stirred to reconsider their worldviews.   We're talking about a generation of young men who grew up being bombarded with social media influencers and from. very young, formative age, injected with new age misogyny and male superiority complexes, that women are feminist enemies and out to ""get them"". It's going to be very difficult to rip and replace that formative influence and conditioning that comes from it with empathy, equity, and respect for others. So no, while it's good they're souring on Trump I don't think this is going to put a major dent in their support for the GOP in general nor does it mean that the Midterms are going to see a sizable shift in the electoral choices of young men.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-04-30T17:34:33,1

Is it because he’s crude, unkind & vulgar, and for a lot of southerners this is their way of saying ‘fuck you’ to the rest of the country?

The algorithm takes them down a path that leads there because that content drives engagement.

"Data may support your position.  Summary: The data shows the young GOP voters don't agree with the older GOP voters on critical issues. To me it looks like 40~45% are voting against their own best interests, almost definitely based on propaganda and their media of choice. E.g. they don't realize tariffs are going to increase cost of goods/gas, something that the majority of young GOP voters cared about the most, as their top issue.  https://circle.tufts.edu/2024-election#young-trump-voters:-more-moderate-and-highly-focused-on-inflation  47% overall voter turnout for age group 18-29. The following is focused on that age group.  Under the section ""Young Trump Voters: More Moderate and Highly Focused on Inflation""  They care about things much differently than older GOP voters.  * They want the government to do more, in comparison with older voters and previous elections  > For example, when asked about their views only about half of young Trump voters said they believe that the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals (51%) and 46% chose the alternative option: **“the government should be doing more to solve problems.”** Not only is this different to older Trump supporters above 45 years old, but it’s also a shift from 2020 youth, when 60% of youth who voted for Trump believed the government should be “smaller,” and just 38% believed in an expansion of the government’s role.   The highlighted quote shows they probably agree with democratic socialism, more than they realize.  * They care about global warming  > On climate, for example, 54% of Trump voters ages 18-29 supported a fossil fuel-based energy policy, lower than all other age groups. This may reflect young Trump supporters’ concern about climate. According to the survey data, 58% of 18- to 29-year-old Trump voters are very concerned or somewhat concerned about climate, compared to 49% of those ages 30-44, 35% of 45- to 64-year-old Trump voters, and just 30% of 65+ Trump voters.  Compared to other GOP voters, most issues polled on look like this  * Only 40% oppose legalized marijuana, vs 66% on 65+ * 52% oppose cancelling student debt, vs 88% 65+ * 53% favor increasing tariffs, vs 81% 65+ * Border and transgender 72% vs 90%  ---  Top issues:  > Over half of young people who voted for Trump ranked “the economy and jobs” as the most important issue facing the country, and a little under a quarter said “immigration.”  > Half of young Trump voters agreed that “high prices for gas, groceries, and other goods” was the single most important factor in determining their vote. Meanwhile, for young Harris supporters, “the future of democracy in this country” was the only issue picked as the single most important factor by a large proportion of youth: 54%  They really cared about cost of goods and gas.  > In response to questions about how the economy was affecting them, young Trump supporters were 16 points more likely than young Harris voters to be “very concerned” about the economy’s impact on their ability to buy food and groceries. They were also 22 points more likely to be very concerned about the cost of gas. Notably, they were only 7 points more concerned than Harris supporters about the impact of the economy on their individual housing and about equal when it came to concerns about health care costs (54% among Trump supporters vs. 55% among Harris supporters).  It makes some sense to me if we look at the section ""Youth in Rural Areas Supported Trump, Urban and Suburban Youth Backed Harris""  18-29:  * Urban: 61% Harris, 37% Trump * Suburban: 56% Harris, 43% Trump * Rural: 38% Harris, 60% Trump  They don't understand tariffs are going to cause those goods to increase in cost.",MCPtz,2025-04-30T17:51:51,2
