How? Movies are made by a series of temporary business ventures and independent contractors. The studio logo at the beginning is just a distributor who bought a final product. Whoâ€™s paying the tariff?,Oceanbreeze871,2025-05-05T10:05:42,10

So how is a tariff paid on a movie? Is there a declared value of the movie at the time of import or are people paying it when they go to the theatre to see it? What about streaming?,joshpennington,2025-05-05T12:55:31,1
"Congress arenâ€™t rejecting tariffs. We canâ€™t control the lunacy in the White House, so Iâ€™m placing the blame on the Congress. Ultimately tax is controlled by the people of the US, they can veto but they arenâ€™t!",Potato2266,2025-05-05T15:33:41,1

"Good question. Disney has filming going on in the UK for Doomsday right now. Will Trump want to see the books on the movie and charge Disney a tax that will then be marked up and passed on to the US consumer on only the portion of the money spent on the film in the UK but not on the CGI, editing and production done in Florida and California?",GG1817,2025-05-05T10:26:34,6

Sounds like a lot of government red tape. Wasn't the plan to streamline? Although this is just censorship.  Worse than anyone thinks.,Laura9624,2025-05-05T12:36:46,2
