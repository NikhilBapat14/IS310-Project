"During World War II, someone—out of spite and jealousy—reported two of my grandfather's brothers to the Gestapo. One was a dentist, the other a Catholic priest. They were never found again.  Stay safe , Americans 🙏🏼",pianoavengers,2025-05-01T10:04:56,553
"The issue is when a democrat comes to power, he will have to pay tens of billions of dollars in law suits because I sure as hell would be suing for millions of dollars + pain and suffering. I just hope the next democrat doesn’t“reach across the isle” and just go like a wrecking ball against the republicans.   This is a lesson you can NOT trust republicans",dyslexic-alien,2025-05-01T10:49:28,97

The difference between Democrats and Republicans.  Democrats will (protect the rights of) 100 people out of concern that 1 person will really need it.  Republicans will withhold (the rights) from 100 people out of concern that one person may not need or deserve it.,Heart_Throb_,2025-05-01T12:08:05,12
Dems could use this to their advantage. I hope they get their heads out of their asses and do something.,Dreaders85,2025-05-01T13:30:12,6
"A question to those that know about the legal terms (maybe lawyers maybe not): Can one deport a citizen from the country that they are a citizen of?  I (not a lawyer) would imagine that deportation is only something a country can do to a non-citizen. Expelling a citizen from a country would be exile, right?   Similar to how if I have a guest over at my house and I then decide that they need to be removed from my house I can 'send them home'. This works in common speech: X guest made me angry so I sent them back home.   But one cannot 'send home' a roommate, live in partner, child, or pet as they don't have a different home. One can expel one of these people (or animals) from their home though this is seen much more negatively.  Napoleon was not deported to Saint Helena, he was expelled or exiled to Saint Helena.",PuffyPanda200,2025-05-01T14:06:09,4
