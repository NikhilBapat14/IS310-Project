"The spin on this is fucking insane.  ""They're terrorists, we just don't have the proof. That's how dangerous they are.""  Wut",philafly7475,2025-04-15T09:26:05,142
"The image is from the [class action lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.G.G._v._Trump?wprov=sfti1#) representing five Venezuelan men in TX that were sent to the Salvadoran prison.

It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”      These men have been denied due process, and the administration continues to deny them due process in violation of an explicit instruction in the SCOTUS ruling last week that this right cannot be waived due to citizenship status.",me_jayne,2025-04-15T09:18:23,49

"When are we going to wake up and start the separation ?? It’s not going to work out folks. These people are over democracy. They don’t like it. We need the states who aren’t over run with nut jobs to decide it’s time to leave before it’s too late.   Trump likes making deals, let’s make deal.  They can have the entire south east and we will have the rest. We can just have people who want to move north or south just take each others houses.  This is the only answer. We need a two state solution before it’s too late. ",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-15T12:30:52,4
