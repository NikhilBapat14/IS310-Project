"The immediate costs of President Donald Trump’s trade war are fairly clear. Prices for imported goods are rising while economic growth is slowing.       Manufacturers are slashing orders, small businesses with Chinese suppliers are on the brink of insolvency, interest rates are rising, Americans’ retirement savings are bleeding value, and consumers are losing confidence.       The severity of these consequences remain to be seen. But even the administration’s defenders concede that Trump’s tariffs will entail some economic pain in the near-term.  The real question concerns the long-term impacts of Trump’s misgovernance. The US economy has rebounded from severe shocks twice this century.       If neither the 2008 financial crisis nor the Covid pandemic durably reduced America’s living standards, it’s reasonable to suppose that our nation will shake off the effects of Trump’s misrule in due time.  Yet there are reasons to fear that his policies will render Americans permanently poorer — at least, relative to the level of prosperity they might have otherwise attained. Trump’s defunding of scientific research threatens to lastingly hinder US innovation, while his discouragement of immigration could constrain long-term economic growth.  To many financial analysts, however, the biggest risk is that Trump could permanently reduce the value of the dollar.  Currently, the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency — the one used in a majority of the world’s international transactions. To see how this works, consider what happens when a Mexican farmer wants to sell pig meat to a South Korean restaurant chain.       The South Korean company probably doesn’t have a ton of pesos in the bank, and the Mexican farmer doesn’t have much use for the South Korean won. The two parties need some medium exchange that is widely accessible, universally trusted, and easily convertible into their local currencies.       The dollar is that medium: The South Korean company exchanges won for dollars, buys the pork with those dollars, and then the Mexican farmer exchanges his hard-won greenbacks for pesos.  The dollar’s reserve status keeps demand for America’s currency and debt artificially high, and thus, our nation’s borrowing and consumer costs unusually low.  But Trump’s erratic and belligerent trade agenda has shaken global investors’ confidence in both America’s economic and political stability. Among bankers and foreign governments, talk of “de-dollarization” has spiked.  ⏬ Bluesky 'bite-sized' article thread (15 min) with extra links 📖🍿🔊  [https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3loh3f4l35s2o](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3loh3f4l35s2o)      [archive.is/JQLvk](https://archive.is/JQLvk)",johnnierockit,2025-05-05T14:20:34,33
"This has been the trend. The rich get rich and the poor get drunk. The economy is skewed toward the one percent and Trump will add to that momentum. It's laughable that now the right wing is concerned about the declining birth rate when they have been taking measures all along that would result in declining birth rates. The GOP cancelled head start and child credit. The vote down Obamacare every chance they get. There are no maternity leave benefits whatsoever in this country. Now they think if they give out medals, that will solve the problem. It's just like the issue of gun control. Nothing is every done so it's kind of silly to think it will change.

"The last recession in 2008-2012 completely ruined my life. I ended up homeless for months, my grades never recovered, and when I was in a shelter eating moldy bread getting ready for ***middle school***, it hit me that the world may not have been a kind place. My mother went permanently insane as a result and I don't blame her. Humans aren't built to live in such horrific conditions.   15 years later, knowing how the recession happened (corporate greed) and seeing corporate greed rear its head again...witnessing the real time conditions for an unprecedented recession and depression is horrible. This time, we don't have any ""public interest"" powers in the executive, legislative, or judicial that can buffer what's going to happen.   Manufactured crises to skim the profits, supported by sycophants, opportunistic people, ignorance, arrogance, hatred, and all it will cause is pain and suffering for those who don't have the blessing of a family.   >*Arguably that isn't the worst part. The worst part is that I try to do the right thing and prevent this from happening to other innocent children, push myself to earn a doctorates, and apparently there's been a massive plot to exploit children through war, exploitation, and sociopathy. People who are in positions of power would rather not do anything, deflect, or engage in their own form of ""corruption"" for their own children and inner circle. Now we're in this massive funding disruption, these same people are crying that they're being let go or they have to stop money laundering. There's people who are actively trying to profit off of this and I'm sure there were others back then too.*   **People suck.** At least my doctorate taught me that [people can be kinder, but are too cognitively weak, ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34410802/)and [sociopaths/greedy people have the same cognitive weakness in their prefrontal cortex. ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29725317/)**Blind leading the blind.**",happyfundtimes,2025-05-05T17:12:54,6

They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up.

It added an entire layer of complexity to the supply chain, and when we had the production interruptions and shortages like Covid and the chip shortage, it allllllll came crumbling down.
