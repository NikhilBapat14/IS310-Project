90 million voting age US Citizens did not bother to vote. Apathy. Egoism.  I met a lot of religious people and the more fanatic they exercise their religion. The more condemning and intolerant they are of other religions or people with no religion. Look at Mike Johnson and his fellow religious colleagues. All they care is about themselves and not one iota on what is different from what they are. Cruelty is easy on others that you do not care about. In the pioneer days of the Americas people moved there to be able to do whatever they want. The Wild West is a perfect example. The slavery just to power the plantations is just another example.

"I‚Äôm  on a limb here, but there are way too many examples of cruelty in America to not wonder, WHY?  You saw battle. The oldest form known in every country. The ONLY wars fought on US soil were with exception of Pearl Harbor, fought over a hundred years ago. Today in the the battle of unarmed vs armed citizens is called GUN VIOLENCE. And we are exceptional in both our tolerance and acceptance of it. Contrast that with Europe. The entire continent is a history of wars and dictators. Today, gun violence there is a rare act, but it does happen.   We on the other hand have our own unique history of cruelty beginning in the 17th century: shortly after the 1st Thanksgiving when after breaking bread with the Native population, we hunted them down, all the while we enforced slavery., followed by Jim Crow and lynching of any black male regardless of age for whatever offense was handy. After the WWars, we just settled down to criminal violence. But for good measure kept racism, sexism (women were more likely blamed for rape than men were convicted) and now we are intolerable of letting people choose their own identity and who to love, because of a book, very few seemed to have totally understood. If they had, why would we need preachers, priests or rabbis?   Cruelty is entertainment, violence sells better than sex.And what is the spark of cruelty? Hatred? Fear? Revenge?  Power? What 6ou grew up with, I wish we had more of it. But we saw it modeled by grownups we knew. We were lectured to do right by those less fortunate. And we knew a bad report for starting a fight, being mean or rude, was as likely to hurt more than what we had inflicted on others.
