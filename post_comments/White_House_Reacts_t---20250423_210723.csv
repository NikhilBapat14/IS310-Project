Maybe try stop detaining and deporting tourists simply because they haven’t booked a future hotel room?,Cheetotiki,2025-04-23T21:12:24,6318
I’d like to hear an explanation about how we can be a safe place to visit while at the same time we are so under siege by foreign gangs that we needed to invoke an emergency war time act to deal with it.

"The company I work for in Australia has a lot of non-Aussie nationals working for them, as it's a Singapore-based company. We had a ton of tech events booked in for the USA related to Azure, AWS, GCP, etc. in the next 6 months. Our CEO has halted all travel for business purposes to the United States because one of the Brazilian engineers working for us, who was headed to a conference in San Fran, was imprisoned and sent to Texas for 3 days before a judge released him. He missed the conference, and the only reason they gave to send him to a prison in Texas was that he had a ""suspicious"" facebook post from 2017, which was not even close to suspicious. He said something like ""I don't get this US administration, they punish the poor to enrich the wealthy"". That's it. Didn't even mention Trump by name.        They then stated that his 1988 tattoo, which he had on his arm, representing the birth year of his sister, ""could"" have been a gang tattoo.

"""They should come here because it is a much safer country than four years ago under the previous president""  You done something about all the firearm abuse? No. Done absolutely nothing.   Made healthcare more affordable? No. Trying to make it even more expensive.   Ensure food and product safety? No. Fired and/or defunded the people  handling that.   Ensure growth in the global market? No. Cause massive market drops, and distrupt global sales.   Respect other countries sovereignty? No. Threatens allies with seizing their land, hinders trading, and kidnaps visiting citizens and students.   Protect people designated as vunerable groups by other countries? No. Will definitely throw those directly in camps, and treat them less than humanly.    Increase trust with allied countries? Heck no. Smooch up to hostile nations, and threaten allies. Back away from established global contracts and organisations.  The exact ""much safer"" part is precisely why we have to issue travel warnings for US. You're at increased risk to be kidnapped by pseudo-governmental forces (What I regard ICE as).

"I'm a US citizen living overseas. I'm also an officer in a trade union. I'm not a communist, but I have no doubt there are publicly-available photos of me standing on picket lines and marching in protests alongside card-carrying revolutionary communists. My union affiliates to the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and I've spoken at conferences where guests from the PSC also spoke.  Mahmoud Khalil was stripped of his green card and branded a terrorist for handing out pro-Palestinian leaflets in the students union at Columbia University. If not for his lawyer being super quick to file an emergency lawsuit before they could get Khalil out of the country, he would have been sent to the CECOT gulag.  Trump also said recently that ICE should be allowed to abduct anyone the Secretary of State brands a gang member or a terrorist and send them to CECOT without a hearing, because giving everyone he wants to deport a hearing would take 200 years.  He also said that ""the homegrowns"" (i.e. citizens like me) will be next.   Therefore, considering that there is more than enough evidence to convince your average OAN-watching MAGA cultist that I'm some bomb-throwing anarchist who supports Hamas (neither of those are true), I consider there to be a non-zero chance that if I travel to the US I could be snatched off the street by masked men in plain clothes and sent to a gulag in El Salvador.

"I would like to give a shout to Stephanie Grisham, who held the post for six months and did not hold one single briefing during that time.   Reporters were still required to show up to the briefing room every day and sit there for something like 3-4 hours, knowing no one was coming, because if they skipped it they risked losing their press privileges at the White House.  Stephanie regularly appeared on Fox News though, so she seemed to feel that her job as press secretary was done. In one of those appearances, she said that people who don’t support Trump deserve to be called “human scum.”  She has since been on some kind of half-assed apology tour, claiming the reason she wouldn’t hold a briefing was because she didn’t want to lie from behind that podium (though apparently doing it on national television gave her no qualms) and even appearing at the DNC last year.

The German girls did not take the first trip back to NZ - they wanted to wait until the next day to fly to Tokyo. They were told multiple times that they would be detained overnight and returned to HNL to ensure that they made their flight as they were not being admitted into the country. They were detained and sent to a detention center. Part of being in the detention center is a strip search and change into a uniform.   I disagree with pretty much everything this administration is doing but this is being inappropriately sensationalized. People working in violation of their visa/waiver is a big problem in Hawaii where there are barely enough jobs for people that actually live here.,HeyItsTheShanster,2025-04-24T09:52:01,1
"https://www.unilad.com/news/tourist-warning-jailed-deported-us-travel-594705-20250421  According to this, they admitted (after the fact, while retelling the story) to planning to do work while they were here, as well as having emails mentioning it.  And for some reason, I feel the fucking need to clarify that nearly every reply to that twitter thread is deplorable and needlessly mean.  Accusing them of being sex workers or drug traffickers.  I'm not saying *any of that shit*.  I'm just saying that saying ""yeah, we're gonna do some freelance work"" is NOT what you should say when you come to the border on a tourist visa, under an administration that is taking every chance they have to be excessively cruel.

"The work they planned to do was against the terms of their travel authorization.  you people HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND they admitted to breaking the law.  We can talk about inhumane treatment they received, for sure.  But the US has always had strict travel requirements, and maybe they weren't being enforced previously, but https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/ is very clear that if you come here for leisure, you cannot work.  I hate this story because these girls straight fucked-up by admitting they were going to work while they were here; and it's getting lumped in with stories about Kilmar Abrego Garcia like they're the same.  One was illegally renditioned, against court orders, to El Salvador, and after SCOTUS ruled that he must be returned, the administration refused to comply.  The other scenario is two tourists admitting to doing something that is expressly prohibited by their travel authorization.  People are acting like these are the same, and it's muddying the waters and just making the counterattacks so much easier.  Because here I am, a red-blooded, patriotic, trump-hating American, telling you these girls fucked up, and no one wants to hear it.  Y'all would rather continue your ""LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ANYMORE IS TRUMP'S FAULT!"" routine, instead of focusing your anger on the things the administration is doing that are actually illegal.  I don't know how I can be any clearer.  I know I'm getting downvoted by people who think I'm defending trump or someshit like that, when it's not the case at all.  But y'all need to understand if the rules say you can't do something, the next four years are not the fucking time to try and do that thing.

"I don't agree that it's inappropriately sensationalized.  We've got an accurate description of what could happen to you if you travel to the U.S., even with the best intentions.  This story is a good reminder to any would-be tourists that CBP can be very suspicious and very strict and that if you do arouse their suspicion (by having unconventional travel plans or by saying a few wrong words) you will not only be turned back, you might also be subjected to degrading treatment.  Americans might not mind getting strip-searched, but those German girls clearly did.   Just a thing to consider before booking a flight to the U.S.   >The German girls did not take the first trip back to NZ - they wanted to wait until the next day to fly to Tokyo. They were told multiple times that they would be detained overnight  Sounds like CBP presented them with two shitty options: getting their travel plans completely fucked up or getting detained.   >People working in violation of their visa/waiver is a big problem in Hawaii where there are barely enough jobs for people that actually live here.

"I promise I’m not trying to be argumentative. But that is not what your linked article says. It does actually quote the deported girls, but the quote is not what you posted. When it quotes one of the deported girls, it reports that she said “We do sometimes small freelance jobs online (like translating or design stuff, for customers back in Germany and sometimes also Asia, not the US”.    It sounds like this was in response to questioning about what they do for work and how they can afford to travel. Also from your article: “They were asking us why we didn’t book more nights or domestic flights, what our plans were, how we can afford to travel and especially about work”   Now it’s completely possible these girls are lying after the fact. But from the information in the article you posted, It sounds like ICE asked them what their profession was. This is a completely normal customs and immigration question that anyone should answer. And that they replied that they were freelancers. And then ICE either misinterpreted their response to mean that they were doing freelancing in the US, or overzealously combined their profession with their lack of accommodation plans to surmise they were planning to work here.    So, based on the info in your article, I’m not sure what lesson they should take away from this. Don’t answer when customs asks you your profession? (Bad lesson. Will also get you deported). Or maybe be better at English if you come to the US so that ICE doesn’t misinterpret your answers to simple questions and kick you out?",istguy,2025-04-25T06:20:57,1
