If you go to the third tab ( expenditures ) the numbers look a bit better showing 2M in 'contributions' against 11M raised. Maybe the contributions are state level candidates or orgs? This is much better than 12k but it still seems to me they can actually manage to use more than 20% of their donations towards candidates than whatever they are doing with the  money.",SurroundTiny,2025-04-28T17:49:19,4

"I think the DNC should help fund all participants in the democratic primary.  Then unite behind the one the people choose.   *Edit: historically, parties didnt even have primaries.  The party system is an inherently private and biased thing",KingThar,2025-04-28T15:55:05,1
"The party did not want AOC or any of the other progressives to oust incumbent dems, but they did. You can’t have it both ways, if the party is so successfully sabotaging progressives in the primaries how did any of them win their primaries?  No but the party must be sabotaging the progressives because there’s just no way their ideas aren’t loved by the people!  Let’s look at Oregon-5. Held by long serving dem Kurt Schrader for 14 years. He was a moderate and notably voted against the dems most recent attempt to ban all the scary guns they don’t like. So he gets ousted in a primary to a progressive who then LOST the election. Republican served two years but was just ousted by….. a moderate!

But above you said you wanted Hogg to be doing this.  Do you only think it’s okay when the DNC funds the people you personally agree with?,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T19:31:57,4
"What the second amendment allows is for state-loyal militias to be founded, effectively expanding its monopoly beyond the army and the police with additional paramilitary groups. Those groups have been deployed at the very least since Shays’s uprising.  Your average bozo getting a small arm is not tipping the scales.",Logseman,2025-04-29T05:42:54,1

"She has been very successful going against Trump. She tricked him into signing a bill he didn't want to. She has great skills. She is very old.  So is this just your pie in the sky dream, what you want to hear? The value of your opinion is quite low after that.

"That’s basically what they do by helping to organize the actual elections then funding the person who wins the nomination.

That’s great. Won’t take that away from her. But she’s 80+ years old. That’s why Bernie is taking someone under his wing.,Davethisisntcool,2025-04-28T16:36:23,0
Which is weird because you’re using a reddit example to explain real life.   “Real life” is actual people showing up to “Fight The Oligarchy” rallies.   hope this helps,Davethisisntcool,2025-04-28T15:07:41,0

"“Hope this helps”…a favorite saying of the main character syndrome.   2016, angry over Bernie, a large chunk refuses to vote are went third party. Same in 2024.   And again, attending that rally doesn’t mean you support progressives, it means you don’t support Trump…as an example, I attended there rally here…so, you know, “Hope this helps.”",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T15:13:36,1
> “Real life” is actual people showing up to “Fight The Oligarchy” rallies.  and what has that helped?   It keeps Bernie and AOC fleecing their flock for donations.   That’s it.,FoolishFriend0505,2025-04-28T17:02:42,0

"They didn’t. He declared his intention of doing this recently. They made him vice chair because they wanted to give a young progressive a seat at the table.  I actually really like the idea of limiting spending in primary elections. Since it isn’t Dems vs Republicans, they could actually do that without worrying about being destroyed by big monied interests",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T16:43:05,3

"Democrats, like me aren’t going to vote because the old guard don’t have our best interests or are listening to their constituents. That’s what it comes down to, we see them as the same as republicans. Unless they do something big to shake up and contrast the same old same old. Why vote at all!",raerae1991,2025-04-28T21:41:01,1
"Then you don’t understand the specific issue.  As a DNC vice chair, Hogg shouldn’t be taking sides and funding any specific primary candidates. If he wants to do that, he should step down from his position in DNC leadership.  The issue isn’t that someone is supporting newer candidates in primaries. It’s that he shouldn’t do it while he holds a vice chair in the DNC.  > That’s what it comes down to, we see them as the same as republicans.  Then you’ve bought Republican propaganda hook, line and sinker. No dems are the same as Republicans.  This BoTh SiDeS nonsense is back I see.  > Unless they do something big to shake up and contrast the same old same old. Why vote at all!
