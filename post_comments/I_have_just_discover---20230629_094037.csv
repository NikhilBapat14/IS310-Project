"I mean… Wikipedia’s sources should give you a good start. He believes vaccines can definitively cause autism, and has translated that into multiple anti-vaccine stances. He’s a conspiracy theorist. He’s essentially a Green Party candidate running as a Democrat. Look up Children’s Health Defense. He’s the chair of that group. It’s an anti-vaccine advocacy group, among other things they think are harming children.",Zeddo52SD,2023-06-29T13:13:36,15
He is being run as a democrat by republicans as a spoiler candidate. He has zero chance of achieving anything other than stealing votes from low information democratic voters.,seamus_mc,2023-06-29T13:57:24,10
"RFK Jr. started his anti-vax career in earnest in 2005 when he wrote an article for Rolling Stone Mag and Salon Mag titled ""Deadly Immunity"" decrying the dangers of a vaccine component called thimerosal, which is a mercury based preservative, and claiming that it caused autism in children. The article has been retracted by both Rolling Stone and Salon but the wikipedia page for it still exists.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly\_Immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Immunity)  Rolling Stone just wiped the article from the record. Salon issued a formal statement of retraction and reasons they chose to do so:  [https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous\_immunity/](https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/)  In the article, RFK Jr engages in selective science, that is, only mentioning the findings he thinks corroborated his claims while either ignoring the refuting evidence or worse citing it as fraudulent.  Some highlights of the evidence he neglected to or purposefully avoided mentioning:  1. Despite the article coming out in 2005, thimerosal hasn't been put into children's vaccines since 2001: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html) 2. His piece ignored the Institute of Medicine study from the year prior of which the results specifically contradicted his claims: [https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10997/immunization-safety-review-vaccines-and-autism](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10997/immunization-safety-review-vaccines-and-autism) 3. Additionally, he either ignored or neglected to mention the 9 studies commissioned by the CDC between 2003-2005 of which their findings ALSO directly contradicted his claims: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf)  RFK Jr. frequently engages in [availability heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic). In layman's terms, he uses buzz words and catch phrases to convince people that a claim is true while ignoring the underlying data that often times contradicts the flashy headline.  For example: Here's a clip from his interview with Joe Rogan. His claim is that ""Wifi-radiation causes cancer because wifi-radiation opens up your blood-brain barrier.""  When simply asked ""How does that happen?"" he neglects to answer.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YQ1Y7c\_Pk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YQ1Y7c_Pk)  Notice that he then goes on to say there are ""10s of thousands of studies that show this is the case"" but fails to cite a single one.  YOU can do a simple Google Search of ""Blood Brain Barrier WIFI Study"" and see that there are indeed MANY studies of the affects of wifi on animals, and they all contradict his claims.  Here's an example: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453585/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453585/)  >In conclusion, UWB-EMP exposure increased BBB permeability transiently and safely in a field strength-dependent manner.  Notice how, if taken partially this result could be said to support his claim  >In conclusion, UWB-EMP exposure increased BBB permeability  But in totality does not.  >transiently and safely in a field strength-dependent manner.  That is the type of ""scientific discussion"" that RFK Jr. engages in. One that lacks nuance, totality, and frankly honesty by speaking in half-truths and treating them as the whole picture.  But lets not stop there, lets take a moment and consider Occam's Razor.  In order for RFK Jrs claims about medical officials the world over knowingly using thimerosal in vaccines while also knowing that it ""causes autism"" (it does not) to be true, it would involve the cooperation of hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors from dozens and dozens of countries knowingly altering the experimental outcomes of hundreds of thousands of tests over a hundred years with the intention of misleading the public.  Which sounds more plausible to you? That? Or one man using his family name to propagate conspiracies for his political benefit?",Jak03e,2023-06-29T17:46:03,9

"He's a right wing grifter cosplaying as a Democrat in an attempt to weaken Biden. He was encouraged to run by Steve Bannon and his PAC is funded, in part, by MTG. He's appeared as a speaker at conservative conferences and has gone on Alex Jones' show. Everything he says is straight out of far-right media talking points. He's a MAGA Republican in every conceivable way.  It's downright terrifying that anyone could look at him and not recognize what he is.",[deleted],2023-06-30T07:25:30,3
"I inherently believe this post is trolling or disingenuous at this point. The only people I know even giving this clown the time of day are conservatives (whatever that means now). I don’t like Joe Biden that much either, but just stop",Sam_DFA,2023-06-29T22:02:10,2

"On top of everything else, four of his siblings published an open letter in the media against his candidacy.

He is more likely to spoil trump than Biden.,Solid_Primary,2023-06-29T15:29:02,-1
"This is a pretty excellent run-down.  I'd like to add to this that RFK Jr has been a fairly consistent AIDS denier for some time.  In his book ""The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the War on Democracy and Public Health"" (yes, that's the actual title) he states he has ""no position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS"" while quoting at length from numerous outright AIDS deniers such as Peter Duesberg.  He also characterized the idea that HIV causes AIDS as ""theology"" and ""orthodoxy.""  Dan Wilson has unpacked RFJ Jr's AIDS denialism [at length](https://youtu.be/c5TxLesI_kU) and in great detail.",HeloRising,2023-06-30T01:51:59,4
Not the same primary my dude. His job is to make sure Biden doesn't have an easy primary and consolidate the democratic party.,Sheol,2023-06-29T17:18:18,5
"Then why is being advised by Republican campaign consultants, one whom just worked for MTG?   I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s funded primarily by Republicans as well.  He’s definitely a spoiler candidate against Biden.",writesgud,2023-06-29T17:28:51,3
He dog whistled 14 and 88 recently.  He’s devious.,TenaciousVeee,2023-09-19T23:25:32,1
Even with his highest polling he's not being Biden in a dem primary. He would have to actually get on the ballad and I'm willing to bet money that there are more people how should've support trump that would vote for RFK Jr than those who support Biden.,Solid_Primary,2023-06-29T17:20:31,1
Please follow my logic here Biden is leading him in the polls by more than 50 points. He will absolutely win the Democratic primary. Which means are only concern is the general l  Most people who would vote in a dem primary are going to vote for a the nominee. Those democrats who voted for RFK in the primary but unwilling to vote Biden in general were more than likely willing to vote for Trump but now they have a write in candidate in RFK. MTG isn't some sort of political genius she is a quack grifter whose in a deep deep red district that would probably vote for an actual dog with an R by their name than a D. Her supporting him is more grift. Rfk best polling is among Republicans not democrats. He's not a serious candidate with serious solutions. And these troll threads aren't going to make that happen. You should be more concerned about Cornell West tbh.,Solid_Primary,2023-06-29T17:40:58,1
What polling are you referring to showing RFK polls better among Republicans over Democrats?,writesgud,2023-06-29T19:38:09,1
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/28/robert-kennedy-jr-biden-democrats-republicans/  RFK Jr. has shown significant polling increases among Republicans over the past few months while Democrats have seen his favorability fall. Since his real first hurdle is winning the Democratic Primary, it doesn't bode well for him.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-30T09:20:28,2
