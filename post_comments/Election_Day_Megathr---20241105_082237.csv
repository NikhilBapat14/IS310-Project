I am a registered democrat but one of my family members posted on Facebook today wondering why he was only allowed to choose between Democrat or Non-Partisan when signing it to vote today. I would like to give an educated response to this. I tried google but didn't get anything.,imamirrorball-,2024-11-05T09:07:18,3
"**Presidential Race**  Obviously we'll all be watching the seven swing states (GA, NC, PA, WI, MI, NV, AZ) but there are a few other states that have been in discussions of being play that could give a sign of how the race might turn out.    The earliest of these is New Hampshire - if it turns red, it could be a long night for Harris.  Likewise, Ohio a half hour earlier has been discussed as well.  If Trump performs poorly here, it could be a long night for him as well.  And then there's Minnesota.  I won't believe it until a week from now, but its been discussed and I'd be remiss to not mention it.  Even though I don't believe it and I will donate to charity if I'm wrong.  **Senate Races**  There are also some interesting Senate races too - Ohio being one of them.  Trump has been leading more than Moreno so it'll be a test of Trump's (rather lacking in the last two elections) coat tails.  And then there's Montana out there which could be interesting too.  But Pennsylvania too, which is just a sign that the election gods want us watching that state tonight.  **House Races**  There's a bunch and its all over the place.  But it'll be a good test on both sides.  We'll be around tonight hanging out and we look forward to talking with you!",AuditorTux,2024-11-05T08:28:08,2
"So the last time I attempted to vote to vote in a presidential campaign, I was told I couldn't because I hadn't votes in the primaries.  Is this True?  I have also been told to have to vote which ever party you registered for in the first place.  And you have to vote all the way.  I don't ever remember being taught any of that.  This was at the polls, I was turned away because I didn't vote in the primary.  Will that happen again?",LittleTricia,2024-11-05T08:32:46,2
"What's the purpose of mail-in and provisional ballots if they might not be counted by the time results are declared? Aside from the Bush-Gore election, most results are finalized within a day or so. If that’s the case this year, it makes me question why I even bothered with a provisional ballot—especially since I only had to use one because I was supposed to get a mail-in ballot that never arrived. If a winner is announced tonight, then what's the point of ballots like mine if they’re only counted days later?",[deleted],2024-11-05T15:11:08,1

"If this really happened, it's 100% wrong. You do not need to vote in the primary, and you do not need to vote for your registered party. If it happens again, I would demand to speak to the person running the polling location, and if they don't resolve it reach out directly to your local political party or the secretary of states office.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-05T09:02:13,7
Hi there! I am a nonpartisan social media monitor with the Civic Listening Corps. Sorry to hear you had challenges voting today! If you still need assistance you can call the nonpartisan hotline 866-OUR-VOTE for more info about your rights as a voter!,homerpilgrim,2024-11-05T08:42:53,6
No you don't have to vote in the primary to vote in the general.,DCcalling,2024-11-05T10:49:12,4
"I don't know every local law across the nation, but that 100% sounds like someone straight up lying to you. All of it, and *especially* the ""you have to vote for whichever party you registered for"" bit. That might be true in a primary (since primaries are generally run by the party, not the state, so they can decide their own rules), but is **absolutely not** the case in a general election.  Turning away a legally-eligible, law-abiding, and registered voter is grounds for a lawsuit, if not criminal proceedings. If there's some doubt about your legal status or registration status, ask to fill out a provisional ballot. Those are ballots that undergo extra scrutiny before being tallied in case there was a mistake in registration or at the polling location that prevented your from having access to a standard ballot.",cossiander,2024-11-05T10:49:27,3
"This is absolutely not true.  The primaries are private, non-legislated events, and you have absolutely no obligation of voting in them.  In fact, I'd record this.",solid_reign,2024-11-05T11:53:07,1
">If a winner is announced tonight, then what's the point of ballots like mine if they’re only counted days later?  The news declaring a winner of a state has no real power - its mathematical projections that has gotten much, much better in recent years.  That and some bad calls make them much slower to make calls.  They take into account all sorts of things, including what the outstanding votes are/would need to be to swing one or the other over the top.  For example, if Candidate A is winning by 4% (52%-48%) they take into account, among other things, how the remaining vote would need to break in order to overcome that lead (because they'd need to be greater than just 48%-52%).  They also take into account *where* the remaining vote is as well - urban areas tend to vote Democratic and rural areas Republican.  But at the very end, all the votes are counted if eligible.  Mail-in ballots are just another way to vote and provisional ballots are used to allow someone to ""vote"" while any issues with their vote get sorted out - in this case, you could have said you never got a mail-in ballot and voted in person, but they don't know that.  Safer to let you user a provisional ballot and count it if your mail-in vote never comes in.",AuditorTux,2024-11-05T15:19:22,2
"In most cases, the results will be clear by tomorrow, late afternoon.   They'll count late into the night, but we generally stop getting updates after 11pm or midnight in each time zone. The updates resume around 9 or 10am in the morning.   However, if either candidate challenges the integrity of the vote and demands recounts in some counties, we may not know the final result for weeks.   I remember 2000, when the election only ended finally because Gore conceded on December 13th.   Even worse is the possibility that the loser may still try to take control and block certification of the next president, like on Jan 6th, 2020...",TBSchemer,2024-11-05T16:55:28,2

"So when we are signing in at the polls, they scan our license and then turn the screen around and tell us to pick one, before we go into the voting booth. I’m in GA if that helps at all",imamirrorball-,2024-11-05T10:54:26,2
"Oh, I agree.  Same thing with Minnesota.  The only poll that showed NH close was Rasmussen who is right-leaning.  Local pollsters have Harris up there.  But if Rasmussen was right, that's an early clear sign for how the night should go.",AuditorTux,2024-11-05T12:27:07,2
"Sadly, it was the person in charge at the polling location.  I knew it was wrong but just didn't know what to say.  After they said it, I started questioning my own knowledge.  Hopefully it goes differently this time.  Thank you, I just wanted to be sure.",LittleTricia,2024-11-05T10:44:36,2

"I know I registered when I was 18, still have that card almost 20 years later.  I never heard of the rules they were mentioning either.  They also told me whoever I was voting for, I had to vote that way for all of the other seats.   If it happens this time, I know what to say now.  Thanks.",LittleTricia,2024-11-05T11:26:02,0
Thanks for the complete info. So slow process and somehow can get complicated. Hope all goes well and tomorrow afternoon all is decided.,8ardock,2024-11-05T17:03:55,1
Georgia is weird AF. The only good reason I can think of is in case there is some local Dem primary that day (so that registered Democrats could participate in the primary at the same time).  Did they ask the poll worker what the choice was for? My experience with poll workers are that they are happy to answer questions.,cossiander,2024-11-05T11:08:10,3

"That sounds like something having to do with a primary.  He probably wasn't registered with any party so if he declared as a Democrat, there probably was at least one other election to vote in.",AuditorTux,2024-11-05T13:52:10,1
"Yeah, that is super weird. My experience with poll workers are that they are generally very helpful, friendly, and professional.  If you haven't already, you could check in over the phone with your local division of elections, or even your local subreddit, in case there are some local laws that are odd or counterintuitive. Where I live, I just walk in, show my Voter ID, sign the ledger, and am handed a ballot to fill out.  I'd also add that if you get turned away for ANY reason, be sure to get all the information you can. Time, address, full name of poll worker, what they were wearing, names of witnesses, specific reason for bring turned away, all of that.  If it's been a long time since you voted, I would double-check that you're still registered (some states periodically purge registrations). You should be able to do this on your local division of elections website. If you find you are not registered, you can check if there's a same-day registration (or re-registration), and if you have been purged from registration unfairly then you should still vote by requesting a provisional ballot, and then follow-up with your division of elections later on.",cossiander,2024-11-05T11:53:22,2
