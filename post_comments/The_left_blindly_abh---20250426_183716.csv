"The left has a history of misplaced anger for as long as I can personally remember.  Young men who were against the Vietnam war were drafted into service, and literally SPIT ON when they returned, by their fellow lefties.    Leftists bought Teslas en masse, and now are being figuratively spit on (literally, their cars are being damaged to the tune of thousands of dollars of damage) by their fellow lefties.  They lost me on the first round of spitting.  They're either children or idiots.",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-27T07:11:43,7

lol the bots on anything Elon are ridiculous. Musk is the American dream personified.,WashedMasses,2025-04-26T22:31:45,-71
"As Elon Musk‚Äôs tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency winds down, it‚Äôs clear Americans owe him a debt of gratitude ‚Äî despite the left‚Äôs unhinged hate campaign against him.  On Tuesday, Musk announced that he‚Äôs taking a step back from his role at DOGE starting next month and ‚Äúallocating far more of [his] time to Tesla.‚Äù  His exit was always planned; so-called ‚Äúspecial government employees‚Äù like Musk can only legally stick around in advisory roles for 130 consecutive days.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T23:46:32,-55

"Nitpick but that whole rescuing the astronauts thing was never a real thing. Speaking as a big fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX and follower of the space industry in general. I followed every event related to that very closely since all the way back in the summer of 2024 and at no point were they stranded without a way to return. They just delayed the return because that was the best way to make use of taxpayer money without wasting it on frivolous extra missions, but in an emergency they could've returned at any point.  If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.",ergzay,2025-04-27T00:06:26,112

It‚Äôs true. They turn on each other very easily. It‚Äôs been hilarious to watch them turn on each other with much more intensity these last few months.,ITrCool,2025-04-26T19:31:07,-34

"Yeah first Nancy Pelosi turns on  Biden. Then they turn on Schumer for not voting the way they wanted him to. Now the vice president of their party David Hogg, wants to do away with all the elders.",bulldog522002,2025-04-26T20:07:46,-28
"They really consider Downvotes and Upvotes to be serious business don't they? As if they translate to real world repercussions, haha. A few months ago I read a funny little story about a shut-in dude who didn't even leave his apartment to go vote for kam√°lla because he was too busy upvoting and downvoting on reddit.com. Sad!",SpecialFree25,2025-04-26T21:23:38,-33
"And now AOC is gunning for chuck schumers spot. So the democrat will turn into the least popular, most socialist, highly divisive coalition that realistically should lose the next like 4 elections. They need to change course *now* if they don't want to drive themselves off a cliff.  Edit: accidentally put ""funning"" not ""gunning""",DannyDootch,2025-04-27T06:48:46,5
