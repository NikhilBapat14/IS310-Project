"Amazon showing how the Orange Moron's ""beautiful tariffs"" are going to affect your pricing is a ""hostile and political"" act. But I thought that ""tariff"" was a beautiful word that's going to return us to the gilded age of the mega wealth living in castles and the rest of us scraping by? It's not ""beautiful"" any more?",Tony2030,2025-04-29T09:16:07,66

They are just heading off the argument that the spiked prices are greed. ¬†I actually like this because it means if the tariffs go away the price will actually drop again as opposed to staying permanently elevated,Cactusfan86,2025-04-29T09:22:22,7
