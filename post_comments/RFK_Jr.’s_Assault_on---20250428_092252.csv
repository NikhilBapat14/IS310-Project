"Mostly the parts about him being willing to dismantle people’s authority that disagree with him on science and the parts about vaccines.

He’s also butted heads many times with medical professionals over things like covid, measles (it’s  not the first time he’s had a run in with it), treatments for diseases that he for some reason believes but none of the experts do (like the vitamin a treatment for the measles). At least to me, it was clear once he had power to remove people and instead promote the messaging he felt was true he would do so. Him gutting the agencies that promote truth rather than the essentially conspiracy theories he’s fallen into is not a surprise if you’ve listened to some of the things he’s said over the recent years.  He also seems to have some really weird ideas about the causes of common conditions (like Covid or the recent autism comments) so he wouldn’t want anyone challenging him on the actual scientific results and medical consensus vs what he has decided is true so if he just removes them they can’t do anything to change that perception   I didn’t have “cut substance abuse and mental health hotline” on my list of crazy things I expected him to do (though I can imagine he probably thinks mental health issues are just caused by like not eating enough tuna or something rather than actual medical science), but almost everything else he’s doing (at least by himself, if you exclude just giving into DOGE or the admin but not personally caring) is the same stuff he’s been saying for a long time now.",Lostsock1995,2025-04-28T13:41:15,3

"The connection of Lyme disease to something man-made in a lab is actually interesting  In the 1970s, at Plum Island (a secret u.s. bioweapons lab) we researched infecting small ticks with diseases that could potentially be used on an adversary during thr cold war that wouldn't necessarily decimate a population like a bomb would, but instead slowly snd discreetly infect a population with extreme fatigue and other debilitating symptoms. The scientist behind it all was a former german nazi named Willy Burgdofer who confirmed this research and alluded to a potential lab leak right before his death in 2014  On top of that, Lyme disease exploded in Lyme Lake which is the closest major area to Plum Island at the same time this research was conducted.  I don't think it was intentional, but the idea of it being an accidental lab leak can't fully be rulled out.
