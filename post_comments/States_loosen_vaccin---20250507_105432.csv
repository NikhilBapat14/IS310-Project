"##Summary:  The U.S. is on track to **surpass 1,000 measles cases** this year as the viral illness  **Idaho** Gov. Brad Little signed into law last month an unprecedented **ban on vaccine mandates for schools and businesses** in the state, which already boasts the highest vaccine exemption rate   On his first day, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order **permitting religious exemptions**  Texas state has been the cradle of domestic vaccine resistance for the last decade and is now the **epicenter of an exploding measles  outbreak** that could end the U.S.’s status as a country without sustained spread of the virus.  “A group of moms got together and basically said, ‘Not on our watch,’”  U.S. is seemingly fraying as more **parents survey social media to find pediatricians who won’t force them to vaccinate their children**.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that **national immunization coverage among kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year dropped to 93 percent**.  Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” mantle — will lead to more cases of vaccine-preventable illnesses in children  While all 50 states permit medical exemptions to vaccine requirements, **only five have prohibited exceptions on religious or personal grounds**.",Aakash7aak,2025-05-07T11:04:49,1

The problem isn't measles.   It's that kids aren't physically fit enough to survive.  Childhood sports has been ruined by all the trans athletes and furries.  This makes them weak. The  only solution is to stop the chemtrails.,insuproble,2025-05-07T11:20:50,-2

"Completely agree. Tarrifs may destroy the economy and make products hard to get, but I'm not going to vote based on my pocket book, or my own personal best interest. Personally I'm a single issue voter with that single issue being girls highschool sports.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-07T12:24:23,6

"This is such a small issue in the face of schools having books with challenging subjects. The fact our schools teach things that I don’t know about makes me feel stupid. And that’s crazy! Nobody can possibly be smarter than me, as my parents raised me to believe I’m a part of the perfect genetic master race. I’m a single issue voter and it is the issue that no book should contradict what my parents told me about the human racial hierarchy, and my place at the top of it.",HereForTheTanks,2025-05-07T15:04:56,1
