Not sad about this one. SHEIN and temu are such crap. Just like Trump.,Admirable-Meaning-56,2025-05-05T10:24:57,34
I’m amazed at all the people on Threads complaining their $600 SHEIN cart is now $1000.   Imagine spending $600 on polyester crap that falls apart after a wash. It’s insane.,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-05T09:58:02,39

"Its latest shape shift took place largely behind the scenes in Washington, DC, where the company took a sharp turn over the past few years into the world of MAGA. Many companies have shamelessly courted President Donald Trump, hoping to curry favor with a uniquely transactional American leader, but few appear to have gone as far as Shein. The company counts Kash Patel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as a shareholder in its parent company, [WIRED reported](https://www.wired.com/story/kash-patel-elite-depot-shein/) in February. Deputy US attorney general Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking official at the Department of Justice, disclosed that Shein was previously one of his legal clients.  But despite the company’s overtures, Trump has dealt Shein a series of devastating blows since returning to office. His administration imposed punishing tariffs on Chinese imports that threaten to erode the company’s price advantage, and simultaneously [moved to close](https://www.wired.com/story/temu-local-warehouses-tariffs/) a crucial trade loophole called the de minimis provision that allowed the ecommerce giant to flood the US with low-cost packages shipped into the country duty-free.  These unwelcome developments come as Shein has struggled in its bid to go public. It is now reportedly [seeking a place](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/shein-gains-uk-approval-london-ipo-awaits-china-nod-sources-say-2025-04-11/) on London’s rapidly shrinking stock exchange after being shut out of the US market. The company is [under pressure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-17/shein-faces-investor-pressure-to-slash-valuation-to-30-billion-ahead-london-ipo) from investors to slash its valuation to around $30 billion, a steep decline from a valuation of $100 billion in 2022, according to Bloomberg.

Their error was assuming traditional rules and logic to taking advantages still applied. Trump is pure chaos and does not operate on that kind of logic.,LookOutItsLiuBei,2025-05-05T09:08:41,9

"Good they got what they deserved. Companies like this and Temu have been abusing the trade and duties loophole of the de minius for years. Allowing them to undercut everyone because they did not have to pay tarriffs or duties, while everyone else did. That loophole needs to be shut forever.",ComfortableAcadia252,2025-05-05T09:18:13,7
