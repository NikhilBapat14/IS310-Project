TL;DR:  Mike Pence received the JFK Profile in Courage Award for refusing to overturn the 2020 election results and for staying at the U.S. Capitol during the January 6 riot to preside over the certification of Joe Biden's victory. The JFK Library Foundation honored him for risking his life and career to uphold the Constitution and ensure a peaceful transfer of power.,Drtardis95,2025-05-05T18:37:35,15
'Trump's former VP Mike Pence receives JFK Courage Award.'  That's fitting recognition for Pence's refusal to do Trump's bidding at his own peril. It's also pretty fortunate for Trump that they don't have a Benedict Arnold award.  #,Troll_in_the_Knoll,2025-05-05T18:46:46,5
An award for doing his job.,sortinousn,2025-05-05T18:44:29,7
"Are you fucking kidding me? We get four years of Pence adjusting his water bottle position to endorse every single thingDonald Trump ever did, said, or thought. Then, *after losing,*¬†Trump asked Pence to do something blatantly illegal that Pence had no authority to do and which wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyway. Pence canvassed opinions, including noted constitutional scholar Dan Quayle, and finally concluded that the illegal thing was indeed illegal, and therefore if he did it he would get in trouble. And so he said no.  Courage!",clickmagnet,2025-05-05T19:35:35,2

"Worse, he‚Äôs on the media circuit today lavishing huge praise on Trump and the worst of members of his cabinet, gaslighting about how Trump knows he has to follow the constitution and a stack of other lies about what a great job he‚Äôs doing.  Pence is a soulless stain.",AntoniaFauci,2025-05-05T20:20:37,4

Plus Pence has been in full MAGA disinfo mode every day since.  Today he‚Äôs doing the media circuit lavishing praise on Trump and the worst members of his cabinet.  He‚Äôs a feckless fraud.,AntoniaFauci,2025-05-05T20:21:43,3
It was because I mentioned Trump talking about  the false claim about cats and dogs in a certain Ohio town during the debate with Kamala over the summer. That‚Äôs what flagged me and removed my comment. Absolute joke,DadBreath12,2025-05-06T11:25:48,1
"In fairness, there was enough violence in that mob that he was probably at some genuine physical risk when he stuck around Congress and did so",AndreasDasos,2025-05-05T19:54:24,7
"Yeah... no.  He did literally the least he could.  And today, he‚Äôs all over the media lavishing massive praise on Trump, and Tom Homan, and Pam Bondi.  Pence is doing the same mild voiced bald faced lying he‚Äôs always done.  He tried selling the big lie that Trump is a defender of the constitution, then when confronted with multiple quotes of Trump saying he doesn‚Äôt think the president has to follow the constitution or support due process, Pence just doubled down on the gaslighting.  He then went on to gush about Trump‚Äôs comeback and the amazing job Pence says he‚Äôs doing.  Giving this prick a courage award is a joke.  Give it to Cassidy Hutchinson or someone else who isn‚Äôt the living embodiment of a fraud.",AntoniaFauci,2025-05-05T20:19:05,0
"Personal politics aside, the amount of pressure on Pence to certify those votes was enormous. Especially with things like the fear of violence and reprocussions. Whether or not Trump would have remained in office, it was thanks to Pence that we did not have to remove Trump.",Drtardis95,2025-05-05T18:42:58,2
"i read his security detail wanted him to leave, etc. but he refused to get in the limo as he did not trust them to bring him back to certify the vote. so he stuck around.   im not american, i have no horse in this race, but from what i have read/heard, he did put himself at personal risk to do his job when i am certain others would have left. is it worth an award? i have no idea; thats for someone else to decide.",FontMeHard,2025-05-05T20:08:30,7
"pence has done the least he could do... it is nice that he certified the election. I personally part of his decision matrix was that he would be disappeared if he left that garage. Don't forget that he sought consule from quayle to see if he could deny the electoral college. Pence declined to testify in front of congress, hiding behind it would be wrong for a vp to testify.....   as a citizen, and a moral human being, pence should start speaking out and helping to stop the flagrant immorality of the GOP. Then he would demonstrate a modicum of bravery",Several-Pattern-7989,2025-05-06T13:25:24,1
