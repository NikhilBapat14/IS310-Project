An expert on the federal work force estimates that the speed and chaos of Mr. Muskâ€™s cuts to the bureaucracy will cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year.,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-04-24T22:10:53,29

man those fed workers will be caught in limbo. Fired with no paycheck but also not offically fired. So no unemployment?,blackcain,2025-04-24T22:18:10,11
"I've lived around Silicon  Valley over 28 years, all in high tech- start ups, large corps, SaaS, etc.  great years/ shitty years.   Very few real leaders exist in tech companies- most of the top tech execs. VCs are truly awful peoole with bankrupt soulswho do not care about the human race other than their own tribe of billionaires.   It's interesting to see the reactions from mainstream society -US and beyond to get their first taste of these grotesque pigs.   Money- in and of itself- was never super interesting to me, maybe because I come from several generations of privilege.   I would honestly be perplexed about what to do with $1b or anything over 100m... Honestly like WTF would you do with that?   Not so Googly anymore now is it?

"The ""Waste, fraud, and abuse""â„¢ slogan used as a shield didn't give that away immediately for people?  Remember when 1984 was like an exaggeration?  When they said they would bring the classics to life, this is not what I was expecting.",No_Method5989,2025-04-25T21:40:19,1

"An explanation I've given for how DOGE works is that its a similar method to how silicon valley programmers work, removing things to see what breaks.   I dont know how prevelant that is but as a non-silicon valley programmer, the context missing is that programmers (or at least, good programmers) have things like error handling, unit tests, version control, etc so if you were going to remove or change something, you can test to see the specific impact and rollback to a stable state if it does break something.   Removing or changing something without having those systems is something which should be done with the utmost caution. Its (yet another) sign of Elons technical inexperience that he did it anyway and with glee.",Scaphism92,2025-04-25T05:13:09,3

I think the other goal is to ignore courts. If the enforcement arm is under the president then they could simply ignore whatever verdict.,blackcain,2025-04-24T23:11:02,3
My form of protest is simple....mentor the incoming generation at work as I was mentored when I started my journey.  Give back.  Help others who genuinely want or need it.   Its a great way to turn negative narratives into my very own light of hope...,goderdammurang,2025-04-25T01:21:16,2
So far they haven't been. They've been trying to fight them every step of the way but only a handful of cases are they defying and even then they're denying it.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-24T23:23:56,3
