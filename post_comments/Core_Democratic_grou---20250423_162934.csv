"...how is hiring private security going to stop the Trump administration from using the power of the US government to go after these groups?   He can have the IRS strip them of their tax exempt status. He can have the DOJ investigate all of them, and persue charges on even the smallest of crimes, and a dozen other things that private security can't protect you from.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-23T19:17:50,7
prevent attacks from militias or groups like the proud boys. Additionally to prevent the DoJ from doing anything they can just use the trump strategy of getting lawyers to stall any cases then appealing everything and send motions to dismiss/recuse for the judges to waste more time on the BS cases so they don't go anywhere,Fr00stee,2025-04-23T21:50:24,-1
