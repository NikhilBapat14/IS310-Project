The number of post on here that have no clue what is really happening is crazy. Do some real research. No one is deporting a 2 year old US citizen. That statement is a 100% lie and when you do the real research you will find it is just news organizations baiting people with it.  The truth is the mother is being deported not the child. The mother wants the child to go back with her so they agreed to allow it instead of taking away her child. The father tried to come pick up the child but the mother refused to allow the child to go with him (the father and mother are not currently married or together which brings up the question of why? maybe he was abusive and she didn't want him to have the kid?) The DEA asked for the father to provide proof that he was the father and if he was then there would be a custody case before she was allowed to go back with the child. As of this posting the father has still refused to give any proof that he is really the father so the child will go back with the mother.  I don't know if you know but a birth certificate would have the father's name on it if he was around when the child was born. He could get it and show proof he is the father but maybe he wasn't around when the child was born and his name isn't on it. If his name is missing from the birth certificate he could ask for a DNA test to prove he is the father but for some reason his lawyer has not told him this information or he doesn't want to do it because the DNA could maybe link him to a crime.  The other 2 children the father I guess had at the same and the father gave custody to 2 other relatives which also may mean he doesn't want to prove he is the father because he is also here illegally. Why would the father give away his rights on the other 2 children if he is a legal US citizen? Something makes no sense here.  TLDR: There is no 2-year-old US citizen being deported but it is being sent back with the mother who is being deported. Sounds like a custody dispute between a mother who is being deported and a father who may or may not be a legal US citizen and doesn't want to get deported.,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T07:23:45,1

"“The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.”  ― Methodist Pastor David Barnhart",Rhannmah,2025-04-25T23:44:47,30

This is the problem with the news today because all the headlines about it are complete lies. The 2-year-old is not being deported. The mother is being deported and because she has custody of the child it is up to her to have the child go with her back to her home country or to find a UIS citizen to take custody of her.  From what I have read given things are always changing the father has refused to provide any proof of being the father so without the mother's approval they won't give the father the child.  This is why no one trust the news anymore because the new articles are just bating people to get mad about something that never happened.  **No 2-year-old US citizen was deported.**  Would you prefer the US to deport the mother and take the child away from her?,Viper_Scale,2025-04-27T07:12:54,1
