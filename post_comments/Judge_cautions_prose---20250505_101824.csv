This is a promising sign that the judge isn't going to let the prosecutors fight this case with a bunch of propaganda.,AllynCrane,2025-05-05T10:22:49,50
Dude is looking at possibly drawing royal straight flush with this DOJ.  He couldn't have hoped for a better situation.,Marvin_Frommars,2025-05-05T10:47:18,20

Weegie has a top notch defense attorney.  She's a pitbull and everyone deserves proper rep.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-05T10:29:49,23
"I think trump and Pam Bondi already know they can’t lose. If the case gets tossed on constitutional rights grounds, results in a mistrial or a not guilty verdict they will simply cite that as more proof of how messed up the courts are. They’ll shoehorn that into some argument for summary/ unconstitutional justice and the MAGA media will fall right in line… just as chaos from all the tariffs really starts to take root.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-05T12:30:18,3
So far no one has been punished for not following the judge's orders in any of the lawsuits. It's not gonna be different here. It's just for show.,Smee76,2025-05-05T17:38:21,2

Potential violation of his 4th amendment rights in the lead-up to his (potentially unconstitutional) arrest.,agaloch2314,2025-05-05T14:07:02,7
Many paths to that mistrial. I’d wage a fair bit of money that’s the result.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-05T12:03:25,5
