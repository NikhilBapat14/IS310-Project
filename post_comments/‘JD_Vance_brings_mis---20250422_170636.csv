Shortly after converting to Catholicism, U.S. vice President J.D. Vance visited the Vatican for an audience with Pope Francis.  Within hours of their encounter, Pope Francis died of mysterious circumstances. The timing could be purely coincidental, but the abrupt death of a very popular Pope has nonetheless raised eyebrows, especially among the more conservative media in the United States.",idiots_r_taking_over,2025-04-22T18:37:34,18

Only seeing the event through your parochial perspective. JD Vance did not trigger this. Our neighbour who also harboured Bin Laden for years have done this.   When 26/11 happened, I did not see George Bush being accused by then incoming President Obama for supporting terrorism as they found out about David Headley, who was not just a American citizen but an asset of the DEA. Similarly Indian authorities did not accuse the Democratic party of being anti India when President Obama's administration moved slowly to arrest Headley.  Partisan bias is why your country is in tumult. Please do not burn whatever little goodwill you all have by making such parochial observations.

Fast forward 3 weeks and the Chinese communists release a news article in Chinese that says that their milk is poisoned and that this would be corrected in due time.

"So, ""racism"" justifies racism.  Is the New Orleans truck attack justified because of America's history of racism and the fact that it STILL practices it at state level, mass deporting brown people to El Salvadoran prisons for dubious reasons?  Remind me of any occasion we've been ""racist"" towards Americans? The Indian populace wasn't insensitive in case of terror attacks or mass shootings in America, and they're pretty much sympathetic. On the other hand, multiple Presidents and political leaders have said uncouth things about us, nearly all of them have disrespected our sovereignty and a number of them have supported Pakistan for decades, even when they were committing a genocide.  I guess those qualities rub off on the general populace as well, even on those who seemingly claim to be some beacon of justice against fascism in America.  At worst, the Indian populace might be silent or indifferent to such a thing, mostly because they have no knowledge of the incident, or they aren't educated enough to understand the gravity of such incidents. But here in this thread, clearly educated people living in a high income country half jokingly invent conspiracies for a terror attack clearly orchestrated by Islamists for achieving the satisfaction of dunking on the Orange Man.

">Doubling down on ignorance, deflecting points without properly addressing the concerns, and using interesting forms of punctuation... I'm starting to smell a bot here.  So anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with you is a bot now is it?  Besides, you‚Äôve yet to answer any of my points without deflecting. What was it that you were saying about accepting other viewpoints?  >1.	‚Å†So you admit that you're trying to sew hate? You just don't like that I'm pointing it out?  I‚Äôm trying to point out that it‚Äôs distasteful to turn a foreign tragedy into your trauma recovery punching bag  >2.	‚Å†I highly disagree, Vance has been a part of the few who has destroyed US Aid. His actions have actively caused more life lost than that single event. If anything one could say it was the US's crumbling presidency that lead to events like this becoming more commonplace due to a completely removed follow through from inflicting justice on murderers like that.  Then we can agree to disagree. You don‚Äôt understand the consequences that this terror act brings. Not only does it mean more repression in Kashmir due to increased military presence, but the way the terrorists killed those tourists is turning even neutral Indians against Muslims. And that‚Äôs not even considering whatever happens next between India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers, which account for a fifth of the world‚Äôs population.  >3.	‚Å†Let's just ignore that I made a good point and use deflection. Great argument that you felt needed to actually have it's own point. Just because something isn't being directly referenced, doesn't mean that they aren't interconnected. Stop choosing to be ignorant.  People here are being ignorant. How many of the comments here are actually talking about the attack and how many are cracking jokes here?  >4.	‚Å†This isn't about making trauma ""about"" anyone, it's not about removing the tragedy from the event. This is just a recognition of events that have transpired. If you can't even make an observation without being called some form of bigot by people like yourselves, then what point is in there in even entertaining anything there is you have to say?  Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be entertainment. Would you go to a funeral and put up a comic show? Sure you can do it, but do you understand how disrespectful that is?  >4.5 I honestly have no idea how that would even be possible, if you could somehow actually make that a thing I think it would be more funny then anything.  Good thing that Indians haven‚Äôt found this sub then. I‚Äôm pretty sure a billion people laughing at your misfortune will make yall happier.",Zealousideal-Froyo-3,2025-04-23T11:57:11,0
