">In the first Trump administration, the US shuttered the consulate general in Jerusalem and reopened it as the Palestinian Affairs Unit, which operated under the embassy.  >The consulate gave the Palestinian Authority a dedicated US representative and a direct line to Washington without going through the US ambassador to Israel. Such an arrangement, where Israelis and Palestinians had separate lines to Washington, was viewed as critical for the US to operate as an impartial broker between the two sides, especially in times of conflict.  >But David Friedman, Trump’s first ambassador to Israel during his first term and a staunch advocate of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, closed the consulate. The move made Friedman, who has openly criticized the idea of a Palestinian state, the primary intermediary for the Palestinians to talk to Washington.  >The Biden administration did not reopen the consulate general despite claiming it would work to do so.  >Rubio’s move to close the Office of Palestinian Affairs appears to be a further step in sidelining the Palestinian ability to engage directly with the US government, especially through Huckabee",Amazing-Buy-1181,2025-05-07T13:51:36,5
"""I just can't vote for someone who serves alongside Genocide Joe."" Uh huh. So, how are things looking now? Trump is perfectly happy to cozy up with a man who is actively considering the wholesale annexation of Gaza after having basically leveled the entire thing to the ground.

"Kamala was obviously the better choice of the two--it's why I voted for her--but the poster is correct in that Kamala would have allowed it to continue.  The weapons would still flow, the money would still flow, the line in the sand would still be miles behind us, and the slaughter would continue.  Maaayyyybee *at best* Kamala might furrow her brows in Serious Concern(tm) a little harder than Biden did, but that is about it.     The genocide would 100% continue, as the poster said.  ",EthicsOverwhelming,2025-05-07T15:14:39,-1
"And you thinking she might have slowed Netanyahu is even more of an assumption.

"I’m well aware of everything that happened to Gaza during Bidens’s administration, including the efforts to get food and medicine in and ban the use of 2klb bombs and limit the military actions to try and get civilians out of the way.  Now **you** post all the ways Trump has helped Gaza. Here’s an easy one, how much aid has been provided since his election? Are there any limits on the size of bombs that can be dropped?  The libs/progressives who couldn’t grasp the reality of the situation and didn’t support Harris were useful idiots used to get Trump into power. And we have every right to be angry at their ignorance.",AmrokMC,2025-05-07T15:02:02,4
> And you thinking she might have slowed Netanyahu is even more of an assumption.   Its better than enabling him and wholesale supporting his crimes.  At least something would be done.

"I don't think a bomb size ban really matters when the whole place is already flattened, lol. And yeah, he let aid come in every once and while, but his actions *as a whole* enabled this genocide.   I never said Trump would be *better* than Harris. I'm well aware that the dude's a lunatic.   But Democrats need to *earn* votes, not expect them to fall in line. Running on the ""yeah we're aiding a genocide but the other guys will aid the genocide *worse* (now let us flaunt the endorsments of these Iraq-era war-criminals)"" obviously isn't a winning strategy.     I thought the democrats were supposed to he the anti-war party? We rejected war pretty convincingly in 2008. Now war is okay because the other guy would do war worse? How about you hold your party accountable instead of blaming the voters?",xxxIAmTheSenatexxx,2025-05-07T15:15:55,-2

"Because they implied there was no difference between the candidates aside from one being “polite” about what they were doing, which completely misconstrues how complex the political situation was. Because they’re quick to show all the shit that happend under Biden’s administration, minus the efforts to help, and not even give a breath to Trump’s wholesale support of Bibi’s actions. It’s defending those who help get Trump elected without calling out how wrong they were. In other words, it was more of “both parties are the same” bullshit.",AmrokMC,2025-05-07T15:26:27,3
"Aside from the bomb size ban, those are good points about earning votes for sure, but the two choices we had were her and Trump, and it was painfully obvious that Trump would be worse. So those who kept protesting Democratic candidates and never Republican candidates deserve this frustration and anger.  Edit: And at what point did either Biden or Kamala give you the impression that war was “okay”, or even wanted?  >How about you hold your party accountable instead of blaming the voters?

"These people basically decided ""if both sides are okay with the Palestinian genocide, then this country deserves to fail"". They let Trump win in order to punish the rest of us for not doing enough. People are emotionally invested in the conflict, so they aren't thinking critically.

"Sending humanitarian aid, when you are helping commit a genocide is the least you can do. Certainly not enough to earn votes.

Here we go!   1.	⁠⁠Under Biden, multiple arms shipments were sent to Israel WITHOUT congressional approval.  https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-arms-hamas-bypass-congress-1dc77f20aac4a797df6a2338b677da4f  2. The Biden admin lied to Congress about Israel blocking aid into Gaza.  https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken  3. Weeks before leaving office, Biden authorized an $8 billion arms sale to Israel. (One of MANY arms sales).   https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/biden-administration-notifies-congress-of-planned-8-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel  4. Biden attacked the ICC for issuing warrants for the arrest of Israeli war criminals.  https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bidens-icc-hypocrisy-undermines-international-law/    5. Lying to the public that Hamas wasn't playing ball on the ceasefire when it was actually Isreal.     https://mondoweiss.net/2025/05/biden-staffers-admit-what-we-all-knew-white-house-lied-about-ceasefire-efforts/  6.

Saying we will have the ""most Lethal an effective military"" at the DNC while also not allowing Palestinians to give a pre approved speech.   2. Shutting down pro-palestine protestors at her rally  in MICHIGAN of all places.   https://youtube.com/shorts/k5GhbwLMC5Q?si=H-hqj6AHs1el8ifc  3. Carting out Liz and Dick Cheney on the campaign trail. (A symbolic way of telling all Arab voters (who have been voting heavily democratic since the 80's) to go fuck themselves).   4. Not breaking from Biden on the issues, saying ""there's not a thing that comes to mind"" when asked what she would do differently.   5. (Allegedly) having emails sent to her campaign about Gaza marked as ""no response"".   https://x.com/_waleedshahid/status/1887642201641099345    So sure, blame the voters if it makes you feel better.

"I don’t disagree with any one point you made except for this:  >So sure, blame the voters if it makes you feel better.  No one is beyond blame, and it isn’t about making me feel better. Voters had a choice between obvious shit that would make everything worse, or bad that may or may not improve one situation but certainly wouldn’t make it as bad as the shit. The fact that it was a tough choice doesn’t matter. They didn’t support the lesser of two evils, they deserve criticism for that fact. Voters, politicians, people, all deserve criticism when they act wrongly. But you can keep giving them a pass, I guess. They’ll need it as they are grabbed off the street and sent to some evil fucking camp because they continued to protest.",AmrokMC,2025-05-07T16:49:02,3
"Alright, I feel that. I would have rather have seen Kamala win, obviously.   It just feels like every time Gaza news comes into this sub, the general sentiment is ""blame the voters/own the leftists/protest voters.""

"Yeah, I can understand that. I personnaly think most of those people are frustrated because they saw the choices and tried to explain it to those who would only vote for perfect, or even good, when we had not good and obvious shit to choose from.
