"""President Donald Trump named Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio when asked who could become his successor.""  I think Vance is the easy choice IMO and I have been a fan of Rubio for awhile. Republicans have lots of great people out there and we have plenty of time to let them earn the top spot.",chances906,2025-05-04T12:25:00,56
"Vance was just si insanely impressive against Walz. He is a dynamite speaker. Quick, concise, well informed....he could beat anyone in a debate.",VeryPokey,2025-05-04T14:00:16,35
"Nice to see him drop the third term trolling. It was funny during the election, but got annoying fast. Personally, I'm all in on JD Vance for now. Incredible communicator.",Zaphenzo,2025-05-04T11:46:43,61
I want a fair fight between JD and Marco in 2028.  I'm great with either of them‚ùóÔ∏èüëÄ,GiediOne,2025-05-04T12:34:16,27
"Little early for endorsements, but I suppose it's smart to get ahead of narratives that left-wing media has stored in a filing cabinet for later. I wonder what will be ""revealed"" about Rubio in 2 years.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T11:37:43,14
"The left will pounce all over the use of the term ""successor"". ""HE's nOt a kINg! REEEEEEEEE"" lol   But yeah, it would be good to focus on future CANDIDATES for election...I just hope enough conservatives are awake now that we NEVER again let our Election Day turnout numbers slack off. The left just spent four years showing everyone EXACTLY why they can never be in charge again. Ever.",nonnativespecies,2025-05-04T17:20:12,2
"At this point I‚Äôm very impressed with JD Vance, he‚Äôs a brilliant speaker and our military love and can relate to him and his life.  There do not seem to be any real contenders coming out of the Democratic Party, and probably won‚Äôt be until they start backing Americans and American values.",BerniWrightson,2025-05-04T14:09:51,6
Leave it to Kristin Welker to pose a hypothetical gotcha question or two so she could challenger Trump about the possibility. It was clear he hasn't really seriously considered it and she should have let it drop but she continued to push so she didn't have to talk about the good job he is doing.,StedeBonnet1,2025-05-05T08:03:33,1
"I don‚Äôt want to get too far ahead of anything but I think it‚Äôs obvious that Vance has the inside track on this. Rubio is interesting given the history but I find myself suspicious. I think it‚Äôs an iffy idea to discount DeSantis too. And, I‚Äôm going to throw a dark horse out there - if Paxton unseats Cornyn and takes that seat, he‚Äôs at least on the bubble. I don‚Äôt like the idea but I suspect Abbott could find himself in a similar position as well.",deadzip10,2025-05-04T18:09:01,0
"rubio i would like to remain sec of state. so that leaves vance and someone else.  rubio is sharp. but he is not maga based on past actions and not sure if he would revert to his old ways  but as sec of state, to me he seems HIGHLY effective, though it is early stages. it is like he was born for sec of state.",SerendipitySue,2025-05-04T17:41:23,-2
"I'd love to see the both of them campaign against one another during the primaries without taking low blows at each other.   They can go as hard and vicious as possible against the dems, but they should be treating each other with respect.  I'm on Team Vance though. I want Vance/Rubio for 2028/2032 with Tulsi Gabbard as Sec of State, and I want Rubio/Gabbard in 2036/2040.",therin_88,2025-05-04T14:29:36,10
"Marco, unlike J.D. has big jobs and organizations to handle.  Statistically, he may have more hot potatoes on his hands and, as such, more potential errors to make.",Ask4MD,2025-05-04T11:46:35,9
