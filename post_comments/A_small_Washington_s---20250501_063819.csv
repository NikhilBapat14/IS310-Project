You really can't blame the tourists for not wanting to come here now.  Nazi level kidnapping on the streets and being sent to another country's prison. No due process. Constant speeches from the government about taking over Canada.   Why would anyone in their right mind think any of these people would want to come here now?,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-01T07:02:22,11

"Canadian here. These stories are devastating for me. I know, we as Canadians have to boycott and stand up for our sovereignty, but I don’t take pride or joy in outcomes like this. Sticking it to the little guy is not something I’m proud of, but I stand behind the stance. I hope for the best for everyone affected by these uncertain times.",Angel_Forsaken,2025-05-01T11:53:40,1

"I really dislike any talk of changing country borders, but this has always been one of the few exceptions. PR should have been Canadian from the beginning. It makes no sense being part of the USA, especially with how it relies on Canadian infrastructure, water and electricity to function. ",AlkaSelse,2025-05-01T07:23:20,6
"My position as well.   I think the same should be applied to most of these odd border ""enclaves"" between the USA and Canada - the Northwest Angle in MN/MB, Canusa Road in Stanstead, Quebec, and like a 50-meter stretch of land on Province Island in Ogden, Quebec.   Canada, IMO, should tender an offer. And Trump is probably the likeliest person to say yes to it, because it's a ""deal"" and has no issues with selling out as a matter of principle.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T07:32:20,4
"Why would we want it? It's filled with Americans. I genuinely don't see a point. They depend on us.   To be somewhat less glib, PR offers us nothing. No advantage. Nothing we don't already have locally. Why should we pay for something we don't need. To help foreigners? Aquiring PR would come with many expenses of administering a small town of little significance and means. The investment would never pay off.  You know who could save PR? America. We (Canada) already exempted satellite communities of our own from Tariffs for this reason. Why punish communities who have no alternatives?",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T08:44:40,1

"Most people in PR are dual citizens. I won't deny I'm biased on this. I grew up in Tsawwassen within about a minute of the PR border. We had family and friends there. PR is more Canadian than many places in Canada, tbh. The argument to adjust borders in these instances isn't really about helping out America. It's more just that it never logically made sense to be part of America anyway, and over half of the buildings there are already owned by Canadians as it is. ",AlkaSelse,2025-05-01T09:08:51,2
You could set an example that you would prioritize your neighbors over politics but that would be leading by example and we can’t have that,f1del1us,2025-05-01T10:26:04,1
"Sure; but what does absorbing the community do for Canada? Why buy it? Even with some number of Dual citizens you're still asking for us to pay for the privilege of then paying to support them with healthcare, infrastructure, and education. I'd also argue any position that suggest they're more Canadian than elsewhere is anecdotal at best; it doesn't mean anything. If there was some valid strategic or financial incentive sure, I'd be on board. But until then they're a community belonging to a foreign nation and aren't our business. I'd also posit if the concern was dual citizens they already enjoy the benefit of mobility if they want to become part of Canada. I don't discount the geographical point, but it's not material. We can't just ignore the reality of the border and like it or not Washington state administers to the community and has for as long as it existed.  EDIT: To clarify, I don't outright reject the notion of PR joining Canada and agree it's likely in their best interest. The problem is we have no reason to pay for the privilege as far as I can tell and have no method of granting those people citizenship. I for one wouldn't want to invite them all to become citizens or deport them from their homes. I guess give them an indefinite visa or something? They'd also be expensive to administer as many are retirement age and haven't ever paid into provincial Healthcare. Basically it's a mess.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T09:47:29,1
"This isn't about politics. I'm not suggesting hurting anyone.  The people of PR are not Canada's responsibility. We did lead by example. We exempted our similar communities from the trade war entirely. That's the only thing that can be done. Paying to absorb the community has nearly 0 benefits for either nation. Stop acting like we need to save them. Their own government is both responsible, and capable of fixing the problem.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T21:09:18,1
"We may just be speaking on parallel notions. I'm more lamenting that PR hasn't been Canadian from the beginning. Like they never should have been American in the first place. I haven't don't a deep dive on what all would entail to actually transition over the area to Canadian now. It sounds like you're speaking reality with very valid considerations, and I'm more talking woulda-coulda-shoulda with a vague ""would not be opposed to them joining if Canada ever went for it"" kinda thing, not ""I think that Canada should push for this"". I'd wager to bet that some of them actually have actually contributed to Canadian taxes though, for what it's worth. I'm currently living in the US (have been for a little over a year now) and pay Canadian taxes without gaining any benefit from it for the duration I'm down here. Likewise, Canada is already supporting PR with fresh water and electricity, so the infrastructure at least to some degree is already in place. But I never meant to open an argument about the nitty gritties on making it a reality. More just to say that usually, I dislike when anyone from either side of the border suggest any part of either country should swap sides (like I do not like the 13th province talk, or suggestions that Washington or California or Alaska or <insert state> should secede and join Canada; with the exception of those weird little areas that really should have (and in some cases were supposed to be) part of Canada from the beginning.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-01T10:44:48,2
You’d be eliminating an entire border crossing. Wouldn’t have to pay for that anymore.,DragonTat2,2025-05-01T12:59:41,2
Are we watching the same governments lol? They absolutely do not have a government responsible or otherwise and they are certainly not capable of fixing problems. My goodness how can you even believe that lol,f1del1us,2025-05-01T21:12:55,1
"Well yeah; when ideological changes are proposed it's good to look at the factors in play to assess the reality of a proposed idea. I'm more angling that the reason it was never changed is it benefits neither nation at this point. Famously countries don't just do things to make our lives convenient. XD  Oh I'm positive some do work in and pay Canadian taxes; but definitely not all, and that's a choice they're making by living in PR. Those people could access CAD institutions by hopping the border already. Obviously nothing we can do about their tariffs though. Americans would not be paying taxes to Canada though. Just like Americans living in Canada report income but pay nothing to the US. So too would Dual citizens report but pay nothing to Canada if they live in Washington. Pretty sure a lot of Dual citizens live in PR because it has no income tax.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T17:39:29,1
That's peanuts compared to the other listed considerations. Providing Education and Healthcare access alone would dwarf that cost. Currently PR residents pay out of pocket for both. This is better for Canada than providing free access to our schools etc for foreigners.,Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T17:32:27,2
You have misread me. The president is responsible for this mess. However you're downplaying the fact that most administering is handled at the state and municipal level. Governors and mayors are already petitioning for exemptions in many places.,Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T21:15:12,1
">Currently PR residents pay out of pocket for both.   If they're dual citizens they don't. Just have to have an address on the Canadian side to officially ""live"" at. If there was a way to find out how many dual citizen PR residents were doing that you'd find that the cost to expand education and healthcare coverage to the rest isn't as big as you think.  EDIT: Also, even the US-only citizens have been paying Canadian taxes, since Canada doesn't have a sales tax refund system for non-residents like Japan, Thailand, etc do. PST and GST on everything PR residents can't buy within their own little enclave is quite a bit.",jamar030303,2025-05-01T18:23:39,1
"Yes; but if they have a Canadian residence they're paying taxes in Canada which means they're still paying in. Dual citizens don't automatically get coverage, you need to be paying taxes in a province. Even Canadians need to register with a new province and update our Healthcards if we move to a new province, hell, even if we move in province we need to update our records and documents or we can be denied care by our GPs. PR residents wouldn't have a applicable provincial ID. The sales tax cuts both ways, in that it's not part of the provincial taxation for the purpose of paying into healthcare, it's just a tax on goods themselves which is levied by businesses, so it's not really paying taxes. At least nowhere near at the level of taxation needed to qualify as ""paying taxes in Canada"" we both know this means property and income tax paid to the province, that's how you qualify assuming you're a citizen or permanent resident. As an aside I also think PR skews towards retirement age which means their Healthcare costs could be excessive.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T20:55:11,1
">Yes; but if they have a Canadian residence they're paying taxes in Canada which means they're still paying in.  Not necessarily. Canada and the US have a tax treaty that means only one of the two countries will get your taxes while you check a couple boxes on the other country's tax return to say ""under the Canada-US tax treaty I owe taxes to only one country"" and get that portion credited back.   >Dual citizens don't automatically get coverage, you need to be paying taxes in the province.   BC asks for a few things to get a services card, but proof you've paid taxes in province is actually not one of them. You can fall under the ""my taxes go to the US"" category under the tax treaty and still qualify for that.  >PR residents wouldn't have a provincial ID.   Why wouldn't they? My experience with BC was that if you're a citizen, then Canadian passport plus a bill, statement, or proof of property ownership will get you a BCID. As long as a dual-citizen PR resident has a cooperative friend or relative on the other side, putting the internet bill in the resident's name or the resident maintaining a Canadian cellphone account with monthly billing will do the trick. Only US-only citizens like myself would also need a work permit, visitor record, or similar.  >it's just a tax on goods themselves.   And taxes get spent on...",jamar030303,2025-05-01T21:14:57,1
"Again, sales taxes don't qualify as paying taxes. You're being deliberately obtuse lol. If I buy something in the US and pay a sales tax I can't get medicaid and vote. You are right about the tax treaty but it's not the only aspect required to get coverage, and it absolutely has an impact on if you pay out of pocket. I know permanent residents that still pay out of pocket because they have no provincial coverage.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T21:29:45,1
">You're being deliberately obtuse lol.  I'm not the one being obtuse here. I always drew a line between dual citizen and US citizen only. If you're a citizen, the bar of proof required to get a services card isn't that high. Same as how if you're a US citizen, you can say you moved just about anywhere in the country and get access to state services, although some states are easier than others (South Dakota, for instance, only requires one night in a hotel in state as proof of address, which comes in handy for digital nomad types who want to shift their residency before leaving the country altogether).   >I know permanent residents that still pay out of pocket because they have no provincial coverage.  And the question would be *why* they have no provincial coverage.",jamar030303,2025-05-01T22:28:22,1
"You absolutely were just trying to score a gotcha. You can't seriously equate a sales tax with provincial and federal taxation for the purposes of this conversation. Nowhere on the same level. I do 100% agree the barrier is much lower for dual citizens but it's absolutely not nothing. Residense and property tax is one of the things I mentioned. Since even Americans here for 6 months of the year don't get coverage if they work in the US. You still need to pay in at the provincial level to receive care without receiving an invoice.   On the anecdote I mentioned. I have no idea why they aren't covered, probably some technicality; but they're permanent residents with employment or in school in each case. So I'm betting there are things we don't know that disqualifies you from getting provincial coverage.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-05-01T23:09:16,1
">You can't seriously equate a sales tax with provincial and federal taxation for the purposes of this conversation.   It's tax money, and it's (the PST part) money the province spends on the things it's responsible for.  >Residense and property tax is one of the things I mentioned.   You don't need that to get a services card. That I know for sure.  >Since even Americans here for 6 months of the year don't get coverage if they work in the US. You still need to pay in at the provincial level to receive care without receiving an invoice.   You definitely don't.   >On the anecdote I mentioned.   Since we're talking anecdotes, I know a fair few dual citizens that have BC Services Cards and receive healthcare in BC without spending more than a couple months in the country or being tax resident. It's just a matter of satisfying the minimum required documentation, and that's as much time as I care to spend on this.",jamar030303,2025-05-02T00:21:42,1
