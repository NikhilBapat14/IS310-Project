"Punishing children for the actions of parents is super common and accepted in our society. At first it seems like that's not true, but when you look at it it's because it is so normalized.

The child gets marked absent, if it keeps happening the child gets detention or other ""disciplinary"" actions taken against them. If the parent doesn't send the child to school with a lunch, who is held responsible? What happens if the child gets school lunch debt? Do they punish the parent or do they withhold the child's graduation? If the child gets home from school and the parent says the child is going to spend the rest of the day helping do physical labor, who is punished for not completing homework? Do children have agency? Do they control the actions of their parents? Do they decide when or if the parent takes them to school? Do they decide if they can actually do their homework? If the parent says do something else, does the child have the authority to overrule the parent?

"This reminds me of another dark time in US history when vulnerable Latinas were bullied or deceived into signing away their rights:  >In the early 1970s ... an L.A. county hospital was years into a federally funded population-control program that targeted poor Mexican American women for sterilization when they came to the hospital to give birth. Several only learned years later that they’d had tubal ligations without their consent; 10 testified against the head of the hospital’s OB-GYN program in a federal class-action lawsuit. **One woman said a doctor showed her the consent form as she was on a gurney being wheeled into an operating room, midlabor, and asked her to sign it to give them permission to save her and her baby. One said she was told her husband had already read and approved the form, when he hadn’t.** Many of these women couldn’t understand the English the doctors were speaking or read the form in front of them.

"Yes, American education is largely to blame. The failure of the voting US public to so much as google ""tariffs"" before voting as one small example says volumes.    What Americans do not have, that other developed countries do, is a strong system of benefits and entitlements that prevents the population from becoming desperate and destitute. It's why Americans think that getting manufacturing jobs ""back"" is the way forward, instead of expanding and improving education to encourage a skills-based economy.   The American left isn't really progressive, it's more of a center-right government. Historically, poor people with little education tend to turn to authoritarians when the system doesn't work for them. In some ways the US now seems to be going through an anti-intellectual period much like Cambodia and China once did.  This is why there is an urban-rural divide in the US and why you see things like formerly liberal states and even minority groups increasingly voting for Trump, and even why states that did vote for Harris mostly didn't do so by huge margins.
