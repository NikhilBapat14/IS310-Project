"Looking back at her presidential run, she didn't win a single delegate as a candidate outright,  not sure if she even broke double digits anywhere.  In a Dem electorate that tends to lean more progressive among the base she made a career as a police friendly prosecutor.  Normies might like that better in some ways, neutralizes a lot of the 'defund the police' attacks when she was the police but the main issue Biden has right now is with a base mad about Gaza and an inability to articulate his own positions clearly.     Personally I have seen her speak a few times and she seems very well prepared and did well but didn't have much in the charisma factor.   Very friendly audiences and just didn't make a connection to the room that I could tell.  I've seen Obama and Stacey Abrams speak in person and they, for whatever faults, can rev you up to be ready to run thru a brick wall.  I just didn't get that from her, or Joe for that matter when I've heard him.  I get that leadership and the job is not about who speaks the prettiest but campaigning is and its worrisome where we are right now.",olcrazypete,2024-07-08T12:34:15,14
"It's not an easy one thing or the other but I think in broad categories, at least in my view, there are three primary 'categories' of things working 'against' her:  1. The trap of her position 2. Her own struggle to brand herself 3. Audience specific issues  **The Trap of Her Position**  Being VP sucks. It really sucks. You catch all of the bullets of being attacked as one of the highest representatives of the Administration but you have basically no control, unilaterally, of your portfolio or the positions of the administration. Being VP, your job is first and foremost, to be the spare to the heir and do the things the President doesn't want to do and support everything they say.  Especially in an environment where there is a very strong and very derisive conservative and right-wing media apparatus (formal and informal) who focus heavily on the daily attacks on liberal and left-wing personalities.  Now there are exceptions to that. Biden and Obama had a pretty notably partnership focused relationship. Obama was obviously the star of the show but it was well-known that Obama leaned on Biden as a trusted advisor and had him heavily involved in the room when he made the big decisions.  From everything we've heard, Biden promised Harris would be that partnership too and from what we've heard and seen, that hasn't panned out. Her staff have gone on background indicated they were frozen out from day one. Her only major policy portfolio has been the southern border - which is a political poison pill if there every was one (it's a policy area where the Admin has limited authority to shift the drivers to the issue, and no matter what position you take, people will hate you from both sides).  **Her Own Struggle to Brand Herself**  Is a problem that has followed from her primary too. And I think it's impossible to say that her being a woman and being a woman of colour especially is not a significant driver in that. But also some of it is herself.  But it's not unlike the 'unlikeability' of Clinton.  Some of that is from an antagonistic characterisation from opposition media and activist groups. It's not any one specific allegation or characterisation but the build-up of them.  It's also that she doesn't have a consistent brand. When she was in the Senate, most of the American public who knew her, knew her as the 'prosecutor in the Senate'. She was best known for grilling people in Senate hearings. She was, to make a comparison, the equivalent of the photo of Clinton that was very popular flying to Tripoli while on her phone working with sunglasses on.  As her campaign went on, she showed different sides of herself. The fun aunt. The jokester. The younger\* voice. The girl from Oakland. etc. And the truth is, she probably is all of those things while also being the prosecutor. But when you're staking out your brand, that variety can make you come off as inauthentic, awkward, and fake (and also, some of the moments, many - were in fact awkward). Brand building isn't about complex figures containing multitudes, it's about encapsulating a personality in one shot to sell to people.  Again, that's obviously harder when you're a woman, especially with some of those dynamics. And especially as a woman of colour. Being aggressive is seen as being bossy (or worse). Being fun is seen as being unprofessional.  Some of these were, in fact, just bad branding and awkward moments that made her look bad (and with the way clips carry, even poor delivery becomes a meme overnight) (The 'you think you fell out of a coconut tree' was actually a really interesting speech but reduced to a meme because her delivery was awkward and we live in a context-free 10 second clip media environment).  A throwback to her own primary campaign, which is kinda where you need to shoot to judge her by her own policy decisions given the above, this also extended there. Her campaign was troubled for multiple reasons but that extended to her policy. One day her staff is releasing policy papers saying she's for Medicare for All. The next day another part of her staff is saying she isn't. Then she takes the stage and says she is. Then she does an interview where she is with asterisks.",PhiloPhocion,2024-07-08T11:43:19,15

"Alot of voters dont think about politics that much. They couldint name a supreme court justice or tell you  how many electoral college votes there are.   The reason Kamala is unelectable is she is a woman and she is not white. Its not that me or you think women or people of color cant do the job, its because Kevin a shop worker in Pennsylvania is un easy about it. It sucks and its not right but it is the reality we are faced with.  On the other side of the coin the progressives of the democratic party don’t like her because she is not Bernie and was a putting weed dealers in jail back in california",AtenderhistoryinrusT,2024-07-08T11:14:23,5

Trump is a deranged and a danger to democracy- go Kamala!,Psychological-Ball77,2024-07-09T16:12:51,1
I’ve always heard there would be a black man in the White House before there would be a woman of any kind. So far nothing closer than Kamala except Hilary who won by a million votes and had it stolen from her by the electoral college. Plus women have not been groomed for the position,No_Carpenter839,2024-07-13T22:35:18,1
"She's ""Black"". Nothing triggers Trump more than that,  and it has always been true of the Republican party.  How did Trump even enter politics? With deriding Obama about not being a real American,  mocking his heritage,  blowing dog whistles.  In the 80s, he refused to rent to Black people.  The right is now the confederates, and they literally still resent losing the civil war, and still think of anyone with Black heritage as being ""inferior"".  This is why they chant things like ""You will not replace us "".  It's why they're anti-abortion! They want white women to be forced to give birth.  This stuff was part of the 3rd Reich- they had baby making as part of a nazi woman's duty, and the ""Aryan"" babies were handed over to the state to raise them.  The depth and fury of their racism is truly terrifying.  The fact that she's a woman and half Black is just more than these extreme racists can take.  They try to hide it behind all kind of other distractions, but that's what is behind all the hate.",ShowerElectrical9342,2024-09-17T04:24:03,1
She was a DEI hire not based on merit or qualifications - her speeches are commonly referred to as word salad nonsense - not sure where anyone has been here but just google word salad VP and u might see what most truthful people  who have listen to Kamala a lot say. For example - her repeat of “what can be unburdened by what has been” has been said by her over and over again with no real explanation of what she actually means leaves one just hanging. And of course her weird cackling laugh is quite embarrassing.,Psychological-Ball77,2024-07-09T16:10:13,1
"Harris has always been unpopular. Being picked as Veep was seen as a political stunt because she is a woman and a POC, not because she was qualified. She may or may not be (my opinion is the later), but given that every task she was given she has failed at as well as her annoying demeaner and how horrible she is at politics, I don't see how she will do well against Trump.",Circus_Brimstone,2024-07-08T12:40:08,-4
Didn't she drop out before the delegates were apportioned?,Maladal,2024-07-08T12:52:40,0
"**Audience Specific Issues**  There is also a dynamic, not unrelated to the above, that gives more specific issues that are particularly salient for different audiences.  I think importantly, and honestly undeniably, she is facing a huge wave now of folks especially on the right deriding her as a 'DEI VP' - and if we're all being honest with ourselves, is an exceptionally thinly veiled cover for a clearly race and sex driven critique. This draws on the idea that Biden, while campaigning, emphasised that he would choose a woman as VP. That doesn't make her any less qualified . On paper, she is objectively perfectly well-qualified to be VP and made sense as such. She's less popular now than when she was chosen, and less popular when chosen when she launched her own campaign, but she was popular at her peak and was a valid choice at the time for a 'likely successor' among rising stars in the party. (I don't personally think that's true anymore given the above but that's not really the question).  There are, however, those who still maintain other policy related issues.  She, as a prosecutor, did pursue some decisions that were seen as very unpopular, especially among more left-leaning audiences, including more aggressive prosecution tactics (especially as they pertain to drug related offences).  She's also (as noted above), still a part of the Admin and thus, reflects and takes the hits from that Admin. Which you'll not be surprised means she has people on both left and right who aren't keen on her from that affiliation and role.",PhiloPhocion,2024-07-08T11:43:33,11
"Back in '16, the DNC was already setting their sites on Harris. I doubt if she was Biden's first choice . I'm not even sure if she's filed the necessary paperwork in all of the states to be put on the ballot. If so, and she were to win the nomination, you can imagine the lawsuits that would spring up. Either the Democrats will need to select Biden or another candidate that has filed the required petitions.   The best scenario I've seen on this is Biden gets elected, takes oath of office, and resigns the next day.",Swiggy1957,2024-07-08T14:17:33,0
"This is massively over thinking it. Unpopular policy positions, a history of being a brutal cop, and being a charisma vacuum.",PrimalForceMeddler,2024-07-09T06:11:25,0
"So it's not that she's majorly disliked by the voters per se, she's non-viable because its feared she would drive away just enough of the electorate to sink a POTUS run?",Maladal,2024-07-08T11:26:28,2
"""We need to keep doing what we've been doing and that time is everyday!""  She spits out redundant and repetitive platitudes that might even be an insult to platitudes.  When she announced her support for medicare for all she actually got the policy wrong, it was a transparent bid for the presidential nomination and also giggled like a schoolgirl saying her aides would be mad at her for announcing this...  I do not blame her for being unable to solve any of the problems Biden has handed her.  A VP can't do a whole lot and she had more power as a senator to affect those issues.  She gets tripped up by easy questions or only slightly tricky ones.  Her, Klobuchar and Biden are all terrible at that.  Abrams, Obama, Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders are all examples of people that are prepared and knowledgeable.  She savaged Biden in the presidential debate by pointing out his opposition to bussing in the past.  Then Gabbard took her down by mentioning her record: opposing releasing some prisoners due to overcrowding despite the court ruling as they were needed for labour, crappy record as prosecutor, refused to prosecute Trump or Steven Mnuchin in spite of her staff advising her there was ample evidence of foreclosure laws being broken by the latter.  Even some GOP AGs sued Trump University.  She had the backing of elites and media but did worse than Andrew Yang.   Even they couldn't make her happen and she dropped out early on.    Biden chose her precisely because she is such a non threat to him.",captain-burrito,2024-07-17T18:47:14,1
"You're correct, after a big start she dropped out December 19 before any primaries had taken place with her polling and support both down.  She didn't prove to have a constituency of her own.",olcrazypete,2024-07-08T13:19:42,2

"Much appreciated.  Do you think it's the audience issues that mostly inhibits her ability to break out as a frontrunner in a way similar to Biden, even with the presumably extensive experience she's had over the last 4 years in Presidential duties?",Maladal,2024-07-08T12:18:02,1
"That's a mis statement. We don't have our convention until September,  but she did have the support of pretty much everyone because she was already chosen by Biden to replace him is he became indisposed...  She very easily got the majority of votes so I think this has been twisted because the Democrats have their convention later than the GOP.  Until recently candidates weren't picked until about 3 months before the elections. We didn't have 1 year or 2 years of campaigning like we do now.  Trump and Vance have been acting like she threw Biden out of the white house and made herself president 🙄.   It's ridiculous.   She was Biden's choice, and by law,  the money he had raised could stay with her, andnshendie very well as the VP.   People are tired of drama and exhausted,  and it being so late in the season, combined with the donor money and her already being prepared and on board as VP, she was the obvious choice.  We can choose whoever we want!  And then that was officially confirmed at the convention",ShowerElectrical9342,2024-09-17T04:33:35,1
"So call me a hack but I've had a 180 on Harris since this was written.  Pretty sure I wrote that before the switch.  I have since seen a complete different energy out of her. Completely agree she is absolutely the legit candidate, no question there.    Also wild to realize 2 months ago this was written with a weird hypothetical 'what if Biden dropped out and Harris took his place' mindset.  Didn't think it would or should happen until very late and now very glad it did.",olcrazypete,2024-09-17T08:02:23,1
