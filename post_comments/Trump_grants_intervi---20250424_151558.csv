">""I am doing this interview out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it's possible for The Atlantic to be 'truthful,'"" Trump posted.

">""He is, as you know, is a sleaze bag, but at the highest level. His magazine is failing,"" Trump said of Goldberg on March 26 during an appearance on the ""VINCE Show"" podcast.  >Goldberg has repeatedly defended his reporting on the scandal.  >""They've decided to blame the guy who they invited into the conversation. It's a little bit strange behavior,"" he told ABC News in March. ""Honestly, I don't know why they're acting like this except to think that they're -- they know how serious a national security breach it is. And so they have to deflect it and push it onto the guy, again, they invited into the chat -- namely me.""  It's old news at this point, but just pay attention to the tone of these two who are adversarial towards one another. Goldberg is calm and collective, and the country elected a dude who throws out shallow, unsubstantial insults.",Parking-Emphasis590,2025-04-24T15:49:21,4

"""The president added that he was informed it will be part of a longer story titled, “The Most Consequential President of this Century.”  I really hope this isn't the Atlantic bowing down like 60 minutes just did.",No_Button9102,2025-04-24T16:00:18,2

"It's likely so he can take court action against The Atlantic. Even today a reporter fact checked him and DT ended the press meeting with ""we'll see you in court.""
