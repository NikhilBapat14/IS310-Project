"You are basically describing modern capitalism in most parts of the world. Most capitalist countries have ""softened"" capitalism with certain socialistic values to ensure the weaknesses of capitalism are mitigated.  The opposite of this--capitalism taken to an extreme--is called lassez-faire capitalism and is generally considered to be a historical failure, even in the context of US history. Capitalism is an ideology, and all ideologies have weaknesses when taken to the extreme. Why would capitalism be any different?",mormagils,2023-02-22T09:56:20,8
"I think what you're describing is social democracy (businesses generally left in private hands, with a robust welfare state and somewhat high taxes).",DifferentOpinionHere,2023-02-22T16:16:06,2
