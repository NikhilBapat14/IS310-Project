RFK was sworn-in the middle of February when the Texas outbreak was already ramping up.  I'd understand your concern and desire to blame RFK if he was denying the existence of the outbreak, or if he urged people to NOT get the measles vaccine - but he's doing the opposite.

Yes, the rate has increased due to increased testing and screening, but today 1 in 19 boys in California are diagnosed with autism.    So that said, if you think increased testing is the only reason for the increase in diagnoseses, then at what rate would it need to reach for you to consider the possibility of some sort of environmental toxin (maybe pesticides in our food, microplastics, forever chemicals etc) playing a role in the increase.  Let's say it increases to 1 in 6 kids by 2035, would you still think RFK is a dummy for looking into things that could be causing a rise in autism?",ron_marinara,2025-04-29T21:53:51,-1
