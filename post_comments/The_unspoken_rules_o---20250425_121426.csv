"It's just internalized misogyny. There, saved you a click.   Young women from conservative households are groomed to often go through a ""pick me"" phase in their early 20s by society and America is basically pumping steroids into that propaganda. The right needs these women before they're 25, before they really ""know better"" and have tasted life to get married.   The pro birther propaganda in a world with 8 billion of us already? Come  on now.",FrederickClover,2025-04-25T12:26:36,59
I can safely assume the only two rules are 1. Repair all the glass ceilings and 2. Shove as much plastic into your face as possible.  Did I miss anything?,Dapper_Peanut_1879,2025-04-25T12:28:02,13
"Let me guess.  A lot of effort towards conformity that is expensive and produces a product that denies age.  Article is paywalled but I am going to guess that Fox News knows what the look is.  Wearing a cross and a lot of effort to satiate the lascivious male conservative  gaze.  Mop the floor without complaint.  Identify your place in a social hierarchy based on your husbands, ignore his dysfunction, remain superficial in your opinions.  Other unspoken rules are to submit to your husband, even while he makes terrible decisions.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T12:18:42,11

They all gave a look they look like dead for wives or hookers. They are sad Barbie dolls. And some are just knock off dolls of the real thing.,No_Palpitation_193,2025-04-26T09:42:45,1

Not for nothing but some of the most liberal women I’ve known have knowingly traded in their ideologies for financial security in whatever form it takes.   Lots of times that form is conservative men.,finally_wintermuted,2025-04-25T13:37:54,-2

">The pro birther propaganda in a world with 8 billion of us already? Come on now.  You got to remember they don't consider the vast majority of that 8 billion as ""humans."" They see it as a few hundred million ""people"" and billions of ""those animals.""   When these techbro facists talk about birthrates they'll often mention specifically Western Europeans as the rate that is going down, as they view it as a distinct threat to their power if they get outnumbered by ""those people.""",DisMFer,2025-04-25T13:01:27,9

"Oh wow perfect description especially the part about identifying their place in social hierarchy based on their husbands. I know so many empty headed women who married controlling guys and then always vote Republican because their husbands tell them to. That saves them the trouble of having to think, if they’re even capable of doing thinking. They gave that up at the Republican altar.",Motor_Basis_3033,2025-04-26T06:52:26,1
They don’t hate themselves.  Their hold on their ladder rung is precarious under an aggressive patriarchy and they would rather be oppressive and conformist than dead or ostracized.  Try living in the south.  It will give you a deeper understanding.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T12:43:54,8
"Oh no - there is.   The party embodies the worst and most extreme aspects of both femininity and masculinity. Poison whispering, aesthetic focusing, hen-pecked hierarchies - it's just the female equivalent of red pill Tate BS.  This political conflict within the US isn't about politics, this has become a conflict over morality.  And as expected, the ones with the worst morals are the ones clutching their religious symbolism the hardest.",8anbys,2025-04-25T12:33:56,11
Some of the most conservative women i’ve know have knowingly traded in their ideologies to be respected and treated as an actual human and not some blood bag to be quiet and pump out babies  Lots of times that form is liberal men.,stjohns_jester,2025-04-25T13:46:21,5
"You are right. Sadly lots of women would gladly give up their rights and having a brain in their head for money. I lost my sister in that way. She was raised a Democrat with good sensible values and married an arrogant staunch wealthy Republican and now she’s a mindless twit. But hey, now the Republican Party gets her vote, even though she really doesn’t embrace their values.",Motor_Basis_3033,2025-04-26T06:59:50,2
"I grew up in it too in the conservative south. I'm so thankful my college boyfriend broke up with me and married a blonde airhead, they later divorced.  I went into a career out of necessity,  was single until I was 28, met my husband who is amazing and have stayed married and have children.  I have really a great life and all those that looked down on me for being single or having a career are getting divorced or are locked into a marriage with a maga freak, have a billion kids and look 15 years older.",Designer-Contract852,2025-04-25T13:33:31,10
I knew someone who was married on her 21st birthday.  When I last had contact with her at 42 (I think) she was up to 7 kids.  The guy she married had never held down a job other than a couple of brief stints as a security guard. She is also expected to provide for the family working 80+ hours a week.,crucialcolin,2025-04-25T17:14:56,1
I was born in Georgia and grew up there for 16 years.   I know how the south is.   And seeing it from an outside perspective now is just sad.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-25T12:47:04,2

It takes courage to do that especially if the woman’s parents were Republicans. That’s the toughest one of all. A Democrat set of parents would accept their child being a Republican 10 times more often than Republican parents accepting their child being a Democrat. That would be grounds for disinheritance!

"I think that's an erroneous position to take.   Because it waves away the culpability of the psychology associated with gender, societal expectations, and positioning. To the unwashed masses, pretty women cannot do wrong (so divine and fragile, uwu) - a core element that those facilitating conservative political messaging appreciate and exploit.   If we don't recognize and understand the extremes within masculinity and femininity, we are due to repeat the same cycles we've been repeating for generations.",8anbys,2025-04-25T12:43:49,6
