"> This is the standard argument: guilty people will stop seeking help from the church.  It’s not an argument. It’s reality. Guilty people or even pre-guilty people will stop seeking help from the church.  > Abolishing religious protection for child abusers does nothing to prevent a person from getting medical and mental health treatments  One, it does. Which then comes to two. Two, there’s almost next to nothing in preventative measures in dealing with all forms of sin, evil or wrongness.   We just keep smushing people into prisons an magically hope it solves the problem.  How is that working out for us?   Third, and by far the most important, who can afford or get medical and mental health treatments?!? Shit was extremely grim before Trump took an axe to the ACA and Medicaid.   Even if, someone wanted to get help, and that’s a big if. They can’t afford it. Priests are the basic level of help that most people can afford.  Getting medical and mental health treatments!  Maybe in Canada or Europe.  > All it does it makes it more difficult for the church to hide abusers. Priest-pervert confidentiality is designed to protect the church, not the child.  There’s so much wrong with that statement that the gods weep.  One, you’ve got a set negative mindset against the church. Automatically condemning it.   Two, all it does is make it extremely hard to find and council those abusers. They will go to ground and they will hunt in the darkness.  Three, you put church = abusers. You’ve already deemed the church as evil.  Therefore evil cannot be battled against.  All you’re going to do is increase abusers and prisoners. Which makes everything worse.   That is why I fear for the children. The adults protecting them have already fallen.  > As a society, we need far more mental health treatment options but we also need more protections for the most vulnerable of society.

"> Is allowing the confidentiality someone how stopping or helping child abuse? Please explain.  Only be confessing one’s sins, wrongs or evils can they confronted. True confession. Only once you gain the trust of the wolf can you drag it into the light. Also allows for pre-identification of those problems.  Call it priest. Call it psychologist.   Once you stop being able to get the wolf to trust you, it hides in the shadows. Waiting for prey to come along. At that point you can only chase after it, jail it or kill it.   Perhaps if we had a better designed system which could address these predators before they become a problem, things would be different. But that would take a massive change in our current system. One that catches the metaphorical wolf before it kills.  With the system we’ve got now. With the limits we’ve got now. The best way to deal with the problem is getting the predator to trust someone. That trust can be leveraged in moving it out of the darkness.   Without the trust. We’ve got nothing to work with. Except until after the crime. After the predator has had their meal.   More prisons. More children harmed. And generally a massive failure.  > Explain to me in the simplest way possible how any of these concerns are addressed currently without this bill.

"Do I have evidence of any Churches, Priests and/or professionals that can move a predator towards a good or neutral outcome?  Yes.  That someone who's confessed to their priest that they raped their don or step-daughter actually stops?  No. I'm not a priest. Although my family wanted me to become one, oddly enough.   I don't take confessions and don't know of any priest that would break their vows in such a manner.  I've got personal stories and references from being in a Catholic Church for several years. But none of raping their son or daughter.   The best I've got is several cases of alcohol abuse and violence. One in which seemly worked and one that didn't.  Several thieves, a case of anger management, a couple of cases of possible adultry.  I was only in the Catholic Church for a limited amount of time and was very young. I wasn't paying close attention to gather more personal data.  As for evidence. Sure, it exists. I'm just not going to do a deep dive into all the possible cases around the world. As for stopping, nobody would have that data. As kept between the priest and offender. Much like asking for the personal records of a psychologist.   I'm sure it's happened. I'm sure some couldn't be stopped. But the biggest issue is thus, how got stopped before they started? How many got frozen or held at bay? How many wanted to stop themselves and sought additional treatment or coping methods?  Dropping a dime on someone that confesses towards something is bad, it's even worse if that person continues their behavior, but, by forcing this issue into law, you've just moved something that could be dealt with into the realm of unable to deal with.  Regardless of confession, the person who rapes, rapes. It's not the fault of the professional that's trying to deal with them.   At least with confession, there's a chance to change things. A chance to stop things before they happen. A chance, not a great chance, but a chance.  Now we've got no chance.
