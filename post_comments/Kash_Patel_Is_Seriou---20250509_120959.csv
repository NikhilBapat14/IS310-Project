"Trump’s pick to lead the nation’s domestic intelligence and security service is a former prosecutor and political adviser who had little if any law enforcement experience when the president nominated him to head the FBI.  But instead of throwing himself into the job and trying to gain credibility with the officials he’s been tasked with leading, a dozen current and former officials at the FBI and Department of Justice said they worried Kash Patel wasn’t taking the position seriously enough.

He wouldn’t read anything and hated sitting through meetings and receiving briefings.  This is the signifying trait of MAGA from the top down.  They don’t want to listen or read or learn.

"Stuff like this, and President Diapers' briefings, and Triple Sec Def being unable to follow his briefings had made me realize something.   Even the most incompetent and shitty people we've had in the past, like during the Bush administration, almost certainly had their shit together. Even the **idea** of sitting through a one-hour briefing **daily** regarding the biggest threats in granular detail sounds physically and emotionally exhausting.   These are briefings with people who have worked in their field for decades, and are trained as both lawyers and law enforcement, or military, and are probably very good at giving clear and concise briefings, but I bet they still use ten-dollar words and acronyms so much that it would make your head spin.   Now we have these talentless hacks who are too lazy to show up at 0830 - which isn't even an unreasonable starting time for *any* job, even white-collar.

"Kash Patel doesn’t like briefings, so the 8:30am daily briefing is now only 2-3 times/week, and he is often late.  He doesn’t like teleconferencing, so he’s suggested his weekly meeting with other leaders of state branches be cut from once a week to once a month.  He has travelled (on taxpayers’ money) to sporting events and to see his girlfriend several times, probably more often than he teleconferences.  His official spokesperson says he is doing a great job, and his actions speak to that fact.  The official spokesperson has either been in a coma since Patel has taken the position or has his head up his ass.

Trump himself isn't even qualified to be a commentator. He's a team owner that only cares about jacking up ticket prices. He doesn't give a shit about the sport or the fans, and would trade the whole team (and fire the coaches) in a heartbeat.  Except... Trump's regime is worse than all that. They aren't actually in it to coach the game. They just wanted the power and prestige. They do the bare minimum of their coach duties, if that. Patel says ""Wait, the team practices every day?

"Declaration of Broken Contract When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, to demand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance. The social contract has been broken. The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated. When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority collapses. In this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation without representation."" This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution. Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties. Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people. LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL --- GRIEVANCES --- 1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments) - U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order. 2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment) - Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance. 3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment) - Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis. 4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation"" - Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties. 5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment) - Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T17:51:53,1

If the prospects going into next year are as grim as they currently are, the industry might contract, and that is going to create a cascade that runs through the restaurant and distribution/warehousing industries because the retail industry represents a good chunk of their customers and product.   Que restaurant and distribution contraction.   Rinse, wash, repeat. ",Dangerousrhymes,2025-05-09T18:12:19,3

"I don’t understand how they weren’t able to see that nothing that he presented would lead to anything but economic contractions and the decimation of most of their industries. The thought that even that class of people was so blind to the obvious reality that Trump cannot be trusted to keep his word, EVER, is disturbing. He will retract his own god damn beneficial agreements if he doesn’t think the optics will look like he’s “winning” enough. His Zero-Sum approach to everything is antithetical to successful global politics and trade.   Mad Dog Mattis thinking Trump is off his rocker felt like enough of a massive red flag that everyone should have seen it. When maybe the most revered general in the whole of 21st century US armed forces says anything, no matter how carefully worded, and people don’t listen, we have a problem.",Dangerousrhymes,2025-05-10T10:01:57,1

Mexican here, I see your point and It does make sense, however as a non american what makes me be skeptic about what Will take for a Dem Wipeout victory over MAGA is that MAGA already has done something that I thought garanteed that they Wolud never have power again. January 6th. They commited something that to my non american eyes was something unforgibable, almost blasphemous. Kneeling before a flag was unspeakable. I thought that entering the capitol would offend all of América. And not only MAGA did not lost by a Wipeout, Trump won the popular vote and EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THE UNION became more republican.

"The quote varies but I believe strongly in the idea that every society is between 3 and 9 missed meals away from anarchy.   Republican candidates often complain about the economy as a tool for getting elected but every time they get in power and totally fuck it up Democrats get it back.   Trump won because when the economy is good, it ceases being an issue for a lot of people who would claim otherwise. His loss in 20 was partly from the economic damage done by his mishandling of Covid.   Never underestimate the unfailing self interest of Republican voters. When they are relatively fat and happy, but they can still bitch about how they’re not fat and happy enough because other people are fatter and happier, it is far easier to vote for their spiteful agenda. When their children’s holiday season is ruined and they’ve lost their jobs and can barely afford groceries, that agenda starts to lose its appeal.",Dangerousrhymes,2025-05-10T00:00:18,2
