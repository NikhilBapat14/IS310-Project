Start with going after the colleges and universities constantly raising their tuition because they know our idiotic government will hand money out like candy.,Simmumah,2025-05-03T15:09:59,89

"Seems like a step in the right direction in a lot of ways, though how much impact it will actually have on the out of control cost of higher education we'll have to see. I've always been dubious about strapping these 17-18 year olds with thousands in undischargable debt for degrees that will pay less than not having one.",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-03T12:58:40,9

">universities constantly raising their tuition  I personally think Universities are a bit outdated, with a lot of course offerings online (example University YouTube channels) they need to reduce their tuition fees becuase information over the internet is so cheap.",GiediOne,2025-05-03T15:32:30,6
"Maybe they should focus on a better degree...we all know dance interpretation from 15th century aboriginal cultural basket weaving ain't paying shit, yet that's the field they choose so why not...",Wide_Fig3130,2025-05-03T16:19:23,-11
"University is a great place to learn new things, learn to socialize, and perhaps even meet that special someone.  Humans do so much better when we can directly interact with other humans (not via Teams). We need to stop the push to an all-digital, isolated world.",Deathgripsugar,2025-05-03T16:22:37,68
"They have this locked up because the real reason most people go to a university is to get their **employment passport**. Of which, if you do not have it, you can't get a job doing pretty much anything anymore.  The real problem with universities is they are massively bloated with administrators who have no reason to be there at all. Much like congress, they hold the keys to hiring and salaries for themselves, so they keep expanding and sandbagging with impunity.  Universities being funded by federal loans should require these mandatory things:  1. Every degree on offer at the campus must show real world actual data on the salary average and range, as well as the percentage of graduates who found career level employment. 2. Every degree on offer at a University must maintain an ROI within certain parameters or the department is eliminated and the funding is funneled into more valuable educational programs. These ROI's will be based on more than financial viability for graduates and the university; but look at monetary, cultural and research paradigms. An art school ROI based on art majors should not eliminate the programs....meanwhile an engineering school with a theater department will most likely end up eliminating the theater department based on the ROI role of the campus. 3. Universities must maintain a specific ratio of students to faculty to administrators. With zero deviation. Ex. If you have 100 students, then you can have 10 professors, which requires 5 administrator and so forth. 4. Universities are required to submit an open to all breakdown of the curriculum of each program at the university, with the ability to report faculty and staff who deviate from the curriculum in such a way that the subject material is not being taught. IE. No more taking a required communications course and having to sit through Fat Alberta pontificating about the newest ""movement"" and the patriarchy for a class you paid for. 5. The elimination of the University internal ""Justice"" system that is heavily biased and can cost students and faculty their careers/life based on the whims of potentially biased students and/or staff. Breaking university rules, the law, or what have you would be required to be deferred to actual law experts in a neutral environment that protects the rights of the student from persecution. 6. Mandatory prosecution of students and staff who violate constitutional rights. Long story short, shut the fuck up and go to class. Save the shouting matches and the blue hair dying parties for off campus. 7. Elimination of educational bloat in classwork. The vast majority of majors at a university are so broad spectrum they are of little value in the workforce. Degree objectives must be refined to the point you are taking classes that have real world value to your career path, not generalized nonsense that you will never use. This can easily be achieved by subdividing the degrees that have good ROI and eliminating useless classes that particular foci do not need. 8. Return University education to the 4 year, 8 semester paradigm. Nowadays most degrees require at least 5 years of study to complete. This is because of bloat classes, time for them to go.    This will never happen, but what the hell I wrote it all out anyway.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-03T18:56:38,9
">University is a great place to learn new things  What is it that you can only learn in a university?  Other than for a few things like medical school where you need access to cadavers, most things can be learned anywhere, now.  Yet people are still going massively in debt for nothing.  >learn to socialize, and perhaps even meet that special someone  If you're spending $100k on summer camp you need an intervention.  Go outside, meet people.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-03T18:44:13,-10
"Engineering, Law, Forensics, Medical, Dental, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Nursing, Social Sciences, Bio-Chem... The list goes on. Just because you dont agree with the structure of Universities and Colleges doesn't mean they shouldn't exist/aren't useful.   There are some things you can learn on your own. True.  There are some things you can learn on the job. True.  There are some things where you need professionals to teach you in a learning environment filled with labs and other resources. Also true.  All 3 can be true.",Simmumah,2025-05-03T18:55:06,29
">Data Science, Machine Learning, AI  I'm going to focus on these, what's stopping you from learning these right now at home?  What resources will a university provide you that you don't have access to elsewhere?  You can get access to A100s and Hadoop clusters from cloud providers, and the NSF will let you play with the big guns for free if you inquire a bit.  And you can often get free access to journals from campus libraries.  Times have changed and university now provides nothing unique for these subjects.  You guys are getting scammed by universities because you're too lazy to learn on your own and are hoping that you can just buy your way into a good job.  That's not how it works.  You'll end up unemployed with a massive student loan debt.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-03T19:49:50,-12
