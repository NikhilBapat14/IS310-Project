The USA is either going to completely collapse and break apart or they‚Äôre going to come crawling back to be let back into the circle.  But the latter will require Trump to admit he fucked up and was wrong.

"No shit, you‚Äôre telling me we do a ton of business with the country we share our largest land border with? Our ally for the vast majority of our history? Our fucking hat? I swear to god this administration sure has wildly succeeded at completely destabilizing our national security.   Do you know why we bounced back so much after WW2? Cause we had the factories the rest of the world didn‚Äôt! Not because they didn‚Äôt want them; theirs were blown to shit!  We made so much stuff! We fought in WW2, but we did not *suffer* WW2 as the rest of the world did. *That was in large part to being sandwiched between allies and bounded on both sides by expanses of water.* Yes. Some small incidents of invasions or bombs occurred in small islands in Alaska and the mainland, but we did not face the blitzkreig. Dayton, Ohio has never been leveled by firebombing.   What Trump has done is threaten one of the foundational cornerstones of that safety. If Russia, if *China* wanted to come at the American Mainland, they‚Äôd normally have to hesitate, knowing that Canada and Mexico would jump in to assist their long time ally. It‚Äôs not like the maniac at the helm has been shitting on the car of both countries. Mexico he‚Äôs been antagonizing for ages, and he‚Äôs still talking about invading to squash the cartels. If that happens, no more ally status. China wants a piece of us, Mexico (and probably Canada, or vise versa) would at best stand back and watch.",KenUsimi,2025-05-10T00:40:21,6
