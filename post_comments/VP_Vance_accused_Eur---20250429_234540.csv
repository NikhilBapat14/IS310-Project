"Who would ever guess that a member of a racist, pro-Nazi, white nationalist, Christifascist administration would have a problem with hate speech laws.   Also, I don’t see a lot of UK politicians banning news outfits from government briefings, jailing judges, rewriting academic policies restricting speech, or deporting protesting students.",Tballz9,2025-04-30T00:07:31,14
"There's some fine tuning needed and I agree some of the examples aren't congruent with the intention of the laws.   That said, Vance isn't thinking about a racist in the UK. He's pissy about X being called out for stoking far-right Russian disinformation during Germany's most recent elections.",nerphurp,2025-04-30T00:02:26,8

"While there's some interesting points to discuss, I do not believ JD Vance is posing such criticisms in an honest and equal manner.   The buffer zones around health clinics are not wide, and balances freedom of bodily autonomy with freedom of speech. If people are not trying to coerce individuas the do not need to approach then on their way to medical appointments. I do not think these offences can be reasonably be considered actual risks to free speech. I know in the USA that free access to healthcare is a mythical beast from far off lands, but that's not how we feel in Scotland.   I'm more troubled by speech convictions otherwise, particularly where there's no direct incitement to violence. When the government can arbitrarily designate any group as terrorist, and supporting a terrorist group is a crime we've got a serious loophole for state crackdown on any speech. But again, considering students are being disappeared off college campuses in the USA, I don't think Vance is considering the free speech of all - only of those who want to use hate speech.",Almond-Praline4195,2025-04-30T05:08:54,2

Maybe I missed it in the article but they were implying that Vance sees it as a security threat and then the article explained how how I view its harsh in the UK in their treatment of of freedom of speech but I didn't see the connection of the security threat.,Cyclonis123,2025-04-30T00:41:33,1
">“I think a lot of Americans would be sort of disturbed by the idea that you haven’t committed a crime, but the police are still going to show up at your house and scold you, and it’s going to be in some kind of record eternally,” she said.  No they fucking won't, half the US is openly celebrating people getting locked up over their opinions on Gaza and actively contributing to banning books across the country that they don't like.  Between that and people getting reprimanded for actual hate speech, I'm know which I'd consider the much more concerning one.",Its-A-Spider,2025-04-30T05:18:28,1
I got laid off because we lost grants for creating school curriculum described as multicultural and for using the word diverse. So ... I mean... I would give his objectively bad take on the world and speech laws at least 5 seconds of consideration if he wasnt a flaming hypocrite working to systematically stifle free speech in the US and moonlighting on a plan to demolish democracy.,Tsisquoquo,2025-04-30T08:20:33,1

"The thing is; even if there were issues in Europe in context of free speech, US is at best a cautionary tale on what not to do. I really hope EU will use DSA to reign in the social media platforms as it is apparent the US, China etc. are incapable to do anything, or even willing to try.",JPR_FI,2025-04-30T01:16:59,5
"I agree. I also think the author or editor makes a key mistake in terms of the title.  There are some good points in the article, but it’s not that citing Vance is a good representative way to make them and it’s perplexing that the publication calls on  Vance as a springboard for this.",Jaded-Bookkeeper-807,2025-04-30T20:27:34,1
"It's the best they could find to discredit it. They intentionally are not calling it out.    The Mormons, especially in the US, are heavily complicit to the Trump admin.",soulstormfire,2025-04-30T03:44:53,2
