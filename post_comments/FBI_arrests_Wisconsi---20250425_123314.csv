"ICE had a warrant for an illegal immigrant. He was in court for beating 2 people pretty bad putting them in the hospital. When the judge learned ICE was in the building, she went out in the hall screaming at them and told them to go see another judge. The other judge agreed ICE had authority to arrest the immigrant who had been deported once. Meanwhile the accused judge arranged for the immigrant and his attorney to escape through another courthouse exit. Yeah they had grounds to arrest her.",bulldog522002,2025-04-25T15:12:45,453

Good. These demoncRats need to realize they can’t interfere in federal law. The administration needs to keep pushing these actions and arrest anyone who interferes in a lawful action.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-25T12:41:04,3

"The amount of unhinged ""judges"" in this country willing to violate their oath and impede on the administrative branch's power is so high its fair to say we no longer have a judicial system.  Judges are supposed to judge without bias according to the law as written.  The law also must be applied equally to all or we don't have law and order.  You think this judge would have treated someone on the right in this way?  Like one of those prolife advocates arrested on a sidewalk for praying due to the face act being falsely applied to them?  There are so many of these cases I don't think I could ever have enough time to compile a list.",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-26T06:26:26,1
 DOJ charged a judge for doing [the same thing? ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/25/doj-charges-judge-obstruction-allowing-illegal-immigrant-escape-ice/3574450002/)   Where was the outrage?

A liberal jury will decide against convicting her and it will be all over the news as an own against Trump. They go so far to protect criminals.,Special_Sun_4420,2025-04-26T11:04:15,13

"> she’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  She'll look smarter when a liberal jury declines to convict her.  They'll use that against Trump too - ""arrested a sitting judge he didn't like on charges that a jury rejected.""",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-25T18:07:32,45

"You do know that the vast majority of people in this country want the illegal immigrants deported. ? Democrats and Republicans alike. I realize you spend a lot of time on Reddit so you have a false sense of the feelings in America, but Reddit is not the whole country. And read it seems to attract all the truly progressive liberals.  This is not a winning issue for Democrats. And if you ever want the Democrats to win another election, you should be telling them to knock it off.",scrapqueen,2025-04-26T12:23:06,6

She was arrested on a FBI warrant signed by a federal judge. So there is at least enough hard evidence to have probable cause.,borrachit0,2025-04-25T14:54:39,24
