">The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. The cobra breeders set their snakes free, leading to an overall increase in the wild cobra population.  -Wikipedia  (And before someone inevitably complains: no, I am not comparing illegal immigrants to cobras. The point is that perverse incentives tend to backfire.)",athomeamongstrangers,2025-05-05T11:37:58,340
"Mexican cartels are charging up to $15k per person to smuggle people into the US. You're not going to spend your life savings just to take $1000 and go home. Also, who knows if you'd even get the money and get returned to your home safely. Makes for an interesting sound bite but not a real or well thought out policy idea.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-05-05T11:40:58,244

"Much as I might not like anything that rewards bad behavior, this is a program that just makes sense. It'd cost us far more to get them out by compelling them so if they're willing to take the payment and leave, then good. Get them a ticket, hand them the cash, and record their information. Go the punishment route if they illegally reenter the country, just like if someone was compelled to leave for the first time",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-05T11:01:26,55

Fuck that. Give them the boot for $0. In fact make THEM pay for sucking up OUR resources.,Simmumah,2025-05-05T12:30:15,20
"I don't hate this line of thinking.  It costs some amount of money far greater than $1000 to deport them.  However, as long as getting back in is relatively easy, this won't have any long-term impact because the next administration can shift enforcement policy.  For any self-deportation strategy to be effective, we need to greatly reduce the incentive to sneak into the country (jobs and benefits).  That starts with imposing E-Verify on employers.  I know Trump has historically been lukewarm on it, but he needs to revisit his stance.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-05T13:37:03,8

It sounds like a good idea but man somehow it’ll backfire. I know Target in SF was giving out gift cards to known shop lifters to deter them from stealing. It did not work.   Maybe we can make payments to them for as long as they stay out of the country. $100 a month for the first year so they don’t turn around and sneak back in.,tacosy2k,2025-05-05T11:24:10,-2

"I agree that the vast majority of people would not accept it, but there will be some that will. If this provides that little extra push to get someone here illegally to voluntarily leave then I think that's a good thing (assuming we properly document it and punish those who reenter just like we'd punish anyone else for reentering). I don't think it's the solution by itself, but I don't see why it shouldn't be part of a solution",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-05T12:57:17,37
"I think this is mostly targeting those who used the app to get here and those who just walked in during Biden's 4 years of open door policy. None of those people spent their life savings to be smuggled in. They didn't have to because they were willingly let in. The article I read stated that the $1000 would be paid after they arrived in their home country, and the average time of signing up and getting home was about 21 days.",OmgIdkLmfao,2025-05-06T02:37:47,2
"The alternative isn’t to get to stay. They’re leaving either way sooner or later.   This point is a good argument against the people saying they’ll keep sneaking in to get the $1,000 again though. They’re not coming back again at that price, so it sounds pretty effective to me.   There’s also the angle that it might cost more than $1,000 in government resources to track them down and detain them pay the officers, all that stuff, so this may actually be a cheaper option just in case anybody happens to take it. Might as well put it out there.",komatsu-D355a,2025-05-06T11:47:53,1

"I feel like this doesn't translate as well when we have a fairly secure border and new entries get expedited removal curtailing the need for the payment. The cost of illegally entering the US in and of itself is far higher than this, so between these two options, it's unlikely to be abused in this way. If anything, it'll likely be underutilized.",cplusequals,2025-05-05T15:03:08,14

"Fair comment. So long as overhead is very low and it's part of a broader boarder policy to reduce recidivism. It could have an extremely small but positive impact. Given the generally accepted hit to the GDP that would occur if all illegal immigrants left, would it not be better to focus on a path to citizenship.

"Because I prefer for the government to use my tax money efficiently. People in the country who commit crimes should receive punishment and then be removed, even if that's expensive. People who are in the country illegally, acknowledge that, and are trying to leave should be aided in doing so, especially when the aid is so miniscule in comparison to what the cost of compelling their removal (let alone punishing them) would be. I don't think that everyone in the country illegally is a bad person in need of punishment, they just don't need to be here",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-05T17:13:18,9

The most blatantly disproven lie of the last election cycle. Trump is getting 10-15k apprehensions with ~3k gotaways a month versus Biden's 140k apprehensions and 55k gotaways a month. With zero laws passed Trump reduced illegal immigration by ~90%.,cplusequals,2025-05-05T15:12:43,12
"That's fair. I think there is definitely the potential for it to go either way.
