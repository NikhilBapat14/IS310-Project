I appreciate he’s at least attempting to use his position financially for good. He’s definitely going to run in 2028. I’m starting to like him more.,TheWorldBeyond11,2025-04-28T06:37:18,10
"From Semafor's David Weigel:  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called Trump and his defenders “tyrants” and “traitors” in a speech to New Hampshire Democrats, making a very early visit to the state that typically holds the first nominating primary.  To win, he argued at the party’s spring fundraiser, Democrats needed to reject a “do-nothing” faction that would “blame our losses on our defense of black people and trans kids and immigrants, instead of their own lack of guts and gumption.”  Pritzker, a billionaire who has been able to largely self-fund his campaigns, told Semafor before the speech that he was not part of the “oligarchy” that progressives were campaigning against: Elon Musk and other wealthy Trump allies, he said, were “trying to impose their will on everyone else, and make them pay for what the oligarchs are unwilling to pay for.”  [Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/gov-jb-pritzker-makes-the-case-for-a-fighting-democratic-party-in-new-hampshire?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)",semafornews,2025-04-28T06:33:43,8

I don’t know this guy well but like his vibe. I wish there were more potential presidential candidates out there being loud and visible. On the race for name recognition Trump is so far ahead of everyone right now. If dems have a hope they will have to get super loud supper fast.,Leopold__Stotch,2025-04-28T07:08:20,2

Pritzker isn't fighting for your values. Your values don't align to his.,DragonTHC,2025-04-28T08:18:24,-3
