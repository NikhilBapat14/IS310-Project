"Truck driver here, albeit one that is home every day. I could not work in the shipping offices I visit, it's so damn ridiculous. So many drivers just show their phone to the office worker and just repeat ""I have pickup"" over and over again. God forbid they don't have the right number or need to be given ANY instruction.",AeonTek,2025-04-28T23:30:22,87

"Road construction worker here.  I never realized how many potential illegal aliens were driving semi trucks until I was put in charge of an emergency bridge building project.  There were four 10' diameter river culverts that washed out during a torrential rain and they took 130' of roadway with them when they failed beneath the highway.   We put THREE sets of barricades at 1/4 mile intervals at each end of the road prior to the washout with signs saying, ""BRIDGE OUT"", ""FOLLOW DETOUR"" and ""ROAD CLOSED"" along with many, many other warning/detour signs.  The number of trucks pulling 53' trailers that drove around all three sets sets of barricades and dozens of warning signs only to have to stop at our construction site was mind boggling to me.  We would get three or four drivers a week that did this during the day.  God only knows how many did it after we went home for the evening.  I would have to leave the ongoing construction, go and speak to them, explain the situation and give them directions on how to get around our site.   Well, I would *try* to speak to them.   Many of the drivers  I encountered spoke little to no English.  It blew my mind.  I had no idea the problem was that bad.   And this was probably ten years ago.  And these guys could *not* drive well at all.  This was a pretty rural area and there was no place nearby to turn around a truck with a full 53' trailer.  The nearest side road was 1/4 mile back the way they had come from.    Now, I'm no truck driver myself.  But I grew up learning how to pull and back up short trailers.  And I quickly learned that the longer a trailer is, the easier it is to back up because it gives you more time to make corrections with your steering wheel.  The shorter a trailer is, the faster and easier it is to jack knife it.  Since the road was completely shut down,  anybody needing to back up had the full 40' wide paved roadway + paved shoulder all to themselves.   It should have been a cake walk.  But watching these guys attempting to back up was actually frightening.  They were *all* over the place.  Some of them had to repeatedly pull forwards in order to straighten back out again.  It made me wonder how many of these guys actually had a valid CDL and how many just hopped in a cab and started driving 80,000 lbs. of steel down the highway at 55-70 MPH.",MildlyBemused,2025-04-29T03:22:39,38
Just like Uber eats drivers I see coming into restaurants and thrusting their phone at the employees while giving off a generally belligerent attitude.,s1lentchaos,2025-04-29T07:51:31,9
