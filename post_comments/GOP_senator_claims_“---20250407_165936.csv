They make fun of all the fit and sporty cis women by saying their muscles mean they are really men.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-07T18:36:52,1
"Honest question: Has women's sports pay increased at all since politicians started crying out to protect women's sports?  (I honestly believe that it should be up to the athletes of the sports if they are comfortable playing with/competing with someone trans, because I'm not athletic, don't play sports, am not trans, and it doesn't affect me, so I'm good going with the decisions of the people who are actively affected by it - but I really don't like the idea of it being such a rallying cry with how low a percentage of women athletes it is, and the fact that I haven't seen any evidence that the same people mad about trans have also been upset about other quality of life issues for women athletes - like their pay scale compared to males, molested by medical staff, etc).",Fochlucan,2025-04-07T18:48:30,1

Yes. Though I'm generally inclined to believe that the politicians didn't have much to do with it most of the time.,althanan,2025-04-07T19:22:55,1
