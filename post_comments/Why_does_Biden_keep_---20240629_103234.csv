"The next part of the statement is, usually,if you re-elect him with a Democratic Congress.

"Roe V Wade is a court case.  So the law was 'created' by the courts, not congress.   Biden is say ing he will get congress to pass abortion rights in all states.   In our system, Congress makes the laws.   The Supreme Court decides if the law follows our constitution, or not.    The court decision now becomes the 'law'.   Many laws are written in lawyer terms, that most of us don't really understand.    So the court determines what the meaning of the words mean.    The difference between the law using  may, shall , must or will can be very minor.  But it can also be the difference between protecting a certain group or not.   And the courts make the decisions on that.  Up until Congress writes a law that is more clear with no fuzzy words that can be confusing.",MontEcola,2024-06-29T20:24:17,7

Wade as the law of the land...

"Politicans frequently overpromise in order to clearly signal their values and what they will fight to get done, or to prevent other things from being done.  Politicians do this because subtlety is not nearly as effective in cutting through the noise and leaving an impression on the voters.  Biden could go on and talk for minutes about the powers he has directly or the influence he can wield on the other branches of government to get certain narrow protections in place...aaaaand now the audience isn't paying as close attention and is not fired up anymore.  Oh and for those low-info ""undecided voters"" they now don't have a simple, clear soundbite they'll randomly hear on the news to tell them what they want to know.  It is also done because party leaders want to make sure they keep certain parts of their political base happy, and so they make very definitive promises so that there is not really much room for the people who are hardcore about a particular issue to demand much more.  So Trump will say ""I will close the border"" and that ""I will deport all the illegals"" when in reality he will be able to put some limits on who gets through and he'll be able to deport some people but he can't stop anything close to every person in the US illegally.

There are probably two seats that will be vacated in the next four years.,ProgressBartender,2024-06-29T15:58:09,41
This will sound morbid but there's an almost 0% chance of the next president being able to replace any seats on the court unless there's an incident. IIRC Thomas is the oldest and he's not even 80. There's no mandatory retirement age for justices and it's fair to say the recent precedent is for them to stay on the bench until they die unless your party is in power.,randonumero,2024-06-29T17:57:40,13
Thanks for mentioning this. I forsee we will unfortunately have 4 years of frustration but we got ourselves in to this mess and we need to take action and get ourselves out.

"“Theoretically a right to choose bill could be passed with a line specifically saying non reviewable by the Supreme Court”  This is patently untrue. Legislation passed by Congress is *always* subject to review and interpretation by the Supreme Court.   The Constitution is the highest law of the land. Congress’ job is to create legislation that does not defy the Constitution, and the Court’s job is to interpret which bills are and aren’t constitutional.  You can’t pass a bill that says “this bill is exempt from courts determining whether it’s Constitutional.” It would completely neuter the judicial branch and upend the concept of checks and balances.   For what it’s worth, I am a lawyer, but I think that information is readily available on Google.",rhdkcnrj,2024-06-29T15:48:22,38

And the argument is that Roe was judicial activism and always unconstitutional. The 10th amendment is quite clear on this.

"A state's rights issue means the federal government has no authority.      That is what this fight is about.     Here is how it works:  If Congress passes a law, it is a Federal Issue.  It remains the law forever, unless Congress changes the law, OR the Supreme Court finds that it is not constitutional.    Example:  Abortion.   The constitution does not speak of abortion.   So Congress acting on Abortion makes it a federal law.  Until then, it is states rights. No congress has given all people the right to an abortion.    Some people sued to make the abortion laws stronger.   The Court rules that those people did not have the 'standing' to sue.  It would take a person harmed by the law suing to make that change.   So, who is harmed by the abortion law?  Will they sue?    Example:  Guns.  The constitution does preserve the right to own guns for a 'well regulated militia'.    So the debate here is what rules can the federal government write restricting guns?    Cannons are illegal.  Machine guns are illegal.   Until the Supreme Court rules that the average citizen can own a cannon or machine gun, they are illegal.   So, is an AR 15 with a bump stock a machine gun?  They just ruled it is not illegal.  So any one can go buy a bump stock and turn their AR 15 into a machine gun.   But Congress did not ban bump stocks.    The president wrote an 'executive order' banning bump stocks.  The courts said 'congress makes this rule, not the president'.   So, until Congress banns bump stocks, they are legal.     What we have is a clear set of rules on how the law affects the issues.    And there are lots of ways to get around someone else's law.   Congress writes the laws.   The Supreme Court rules if that law is allowable under the constitution.   The president can write an order changing the law.  It stays in affect until someone sues, and the court accepts the case.    If they do, what ever they say is the law.   If it is an order, congress can pass a law changing that, or putting it into federal law.    The system guarantees that there will be court cases and arguments about so many issues forever and ever.  There will be some new way to argue the law needs to be changed one way or another.",MontEcola,2024-06-30T14:48:57,1

It’s a lot more complicated than that.Federalism is always complex and jurisdiction stripping is a complex topic. Courts always have the power to determine if they have jurisdiction and jurisdiction stripping bills can be rejected as unconstitutional.

That’s the main problem. Roe was on flimsy grounds and Casey others made it even flimsier. It was never a federally protected right…that said I think there needs to be a movement of states that make it a state right at least. My main problem with abortion jurisprudence was always how crappy the legal reasoning was not really so much the topic.  Maybe start with a bill that gives states that protect abortion rights X millions of dollars though I have a feeling that would be an absolute nightmare in terms of setting precedent for politicians to actually use the power of withholding money to jump around the 10th amendment but the 10th has been severely weakened with the direct election of Senators and as Scalia himself said there’s only so much you can stick up for it without the voters saying yeah we want the 10th back.,nateo200,2024-06-30T22:15:44,2

"I agree with part of that:  The federal government has some responsibility and the states have other responsibilities.    The federal government also has the responsibility and the right to protect American people.     Let's take the issue of slavery as an example.   Some states claimed it was a right of a state to allow slavery.  The federal government said there shall be no slavery.    This is a case of the federal laws stepping in to protect all people.     Let's take pollution as a different example.    Lets say there is a state up stream on a major river.    If they dump toxic chemicals into the water the pollution can just drift downstream and poison the fish and industry all the way to the ocean.    The federal government creates laws to protect the waterways.   The same is true for clean air.    And if it is a different country (Mexico or Canada) the government will act to protect American interests.   In Washington State, raw sewage form Victoria, BC, Canada used to fill the Puget Sound with poop.   It drifted into the US.  Until the US put pressure on the city to fix their sewage problem.   And the farms in the Frasier Valley, BC, Canada allow their sewage and animal waste to flow openly into the Sumas valley, and into the streams that lead into the Nooksack River.   Which also flows into the Puget Sound.    I am not sure what our government is doing about that.  But I sure as hell wish we did not have Canadian pollution flowing down our salmon streams and into the bay where the Orca whales live.     When states do not do the minimum to protect their own people, or the minimum to keep pollution out of someone else's state, the federal government has the responsibility and the right to step in and take action.     Analogy:  I am on a cruise ship.    I want to drill a hole in the wall of my cabin and let water into the ship.   The leaders of the ship (Captain and crew) have the right and responsibility to make sure I do not make that hole.    Yes I paid for the cabin, and I do not have the right to harm the ship or anyone aboard.   So the small government argument only serves those few people who don't get that we are all connected to each other.   Once you have seen a floating solid waste and toilet paper float down in your swilling hole you will agree.  So that was a very long winded way to say I do not GAF about any small government argument.",MontEcola,2024-06-30T18:14:14,2
"You’ll want to look at the latest jurisdiction stripping case law like Hamdan v Rumsfeld, Boumeide v Bush, Patchak v Zinke, Appalachian Voices v. US Dept of Interior, etc. since abortion is not a federal constitutional right I do think a jurisdiction stripping provision would have a better chance of survival but like you say they might do something like require review only in the DC District and Circuit Courts.   If I wanted to revive abortion federally as president id put justices on the court that I knew would uphold a statute codifying it then I’d get Congress to pass a statute that required any injunction against the statute to require a three judge district court under 28 USC 2284 as thst statute provides for mandatory and direct appeal to SCOTUS who must hear the matter on the merits. I think it’s moot tho as a federal statutory right to abortion wouldn’t create a constitutional right. Abortion has always traditionally been something states handle like probate and domestic affairs and healthcare matters",nateo200,2024-06-30T17:16:09,2
Simple most federal agencies have drastically expanded their authority beyond what the constitution allows.,brinerbear,2024-06-30T14:09:39,0
