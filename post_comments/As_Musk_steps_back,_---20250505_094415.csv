"> Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Yale Budget Lab, said Musk evidently has little interest in making services better. “They were the ‘department of government slash and burn’,” Gimbel said. “There doesn’t seem to be an approach to dig in on places where government services could really be improved. Any improvement in government services takes time. You have to invest. You have to build it out. You have to figure out how to fix it.”  > Martha Gimbel of the Yale Budget Lab Asked whether Musk and Doge had improved any government services, Gimbel burst out in laughter. “No,” she said. “There has clearly been a degeneration of government services.”  > Public policy experts and members of the public have pointed to numerous ways that government services have deteriorated due to Doge’s cuts. There have been longer waiting times to get appointments at veterans’ hospitals, longer waits when people call the Internal Revenue Service, longer lines at social security offices. The departure of many highly experienced social security employees has led to workers with far less training giving advice on benefits.",Araminal,2025-05-05T09:47:25,26

"Isn't it crazy how having highly regulated service-based operations with lots of oversight and the purchasing power of the US government (because that's what it is) was actually very efficient at providing services to those in need?  Add to it that those services were not trying to profit (because, until recently the government wasn't being run overtly to profit).  Replacing that with individuals having to ask for-profit companies if they can even provide what they were getting from government departments is just going to make it more expensive for people to get what they need.  The blame for the rise of all of this lies with Ronald Reagan.

It's like he's playing a game of ""how low can you go"" with transparency!   The fact that experts are saying these cuts harm government services just underscores how reckless this whole DOGE project really is. It's no wonder that federal spending continues to hit new records despite Musk’s claims.   But hey, if you're a Republican, I guess you love this chaos. It’s what you thrive on, right? Just more proof that when it comes to governance, they’re as clueless as they are corrupt. 🥴",Otherwise_Dot4091,2025-05-06T09:26:28,2

Multiple contracts, a company town approved, massive data sets, back doors in just about any government department, every organization investigating him gutted and multiple investigations halted.   Yeah everyone is making fun of him but eh?",Noobsauce57,2025-05-05T11:59:51,23
Nah they aren’t all doing this for Putin. Musk gets a lot of power and future $$$ from this sabotage,AndreasDasos,2025-05-05T16:29:36,2
