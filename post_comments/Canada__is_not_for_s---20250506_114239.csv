I have this shit on TV now and had to turn it off because Trump is so embarrassing to watch .,TotallyNotRobotEvil,2025-05-06T11:44:04,55
Trump is an absolute disgrace. He is so disrespectful and treats heads of state as if they are his inferiors.   America you really need to get rid of this clown. He gets bolder and more reckless as each day passes. Surrounded by sycophants and toads who will only ever agree with him.,Lordhawhaw-_,2025-05-06T11:51:06,43
