"A quick browse through [Fox News' 'labor unions' tag](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/labor-unions) shows most of the headlines are negative toward unions.  If by ""Fox News"" you mean the TV network, labor issues are rarely high-profile enough to warrant much coverage on their shows.",anneoftheisland,2022-08-09T10:32:01,6
"I suppose part of the reason is that labor unions just aren't as much of a force as they used to be.  [Only about 10% of American workers](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/union-membership-rate-declines-in-2021-returns-to-2019-rate-of-10-3-percent.htm) belong to unions, compared to 35.5% back in 1945.",NerdyLumberjack04,2022-08-08T20:23:38,2
"Ok, thanks, I wasn't aware that was available on the Fox News site.  Yea, it seems like 99% of the labor union stories are related to *teachers unions*.  I only story I found that wasn't about the teachers union was about the concession workers union at Dodger Stadium.   I'm guessing conservative media thrives on *culture wars* and it gets better ratings to focus on teachers than auto workers?",LeftPhilly,2022-08-14T16:44:10,1
