"Despite its name, Against Democracy by Jason Brennan, isn't against the concept of democracy but of the universal franchise itself. He explains the problem of letting basically everyone above a certain age vote regardless of their knowledge of civics and how it's led to the degradation in governance of various democratic nations and proposes a solution through a limited democracy where people votes are either restricted or weighted based on their level of civics knowledge.  The author is a libertarian political science professor.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-11-08T11:50:06,5
"Undoing the Demos by Wendy Brown is a very good analysis of this (although focusing on the less explicit anti-democratic rhetoric in libertarianism, it applies even more so to Rothbard and Hoppe)   Yanis Varoufakis has a book called Technofeudalism, which I have not read but have heard good things about.",loselyconscious,2024-11-09T21:58:54,2
