"Another incredibly stupid headline that completely fails to grasp how dire things are  See, it f\*cking is his choice as long as the legislature won't impeach him.  The whole point/requirement of checks and balances is that there are - checks and balances. We can see clearly that they are not doing that so the system doesn't work.  He can do whatever he wants. f\*ck even if is actively disobeys the Supreme Court there is no consequence if the legislature won't do anything",Farley2k,2025-05-05T16:11:59,1
It is his choice. It’s any person’s choice to follow the law or break the law. His choice is to occupy the highest office and violate the highest law. Our choice is what to do about it. What will your “representatives” choose?,twitch_delta_blues,2025-05-05T16:13:25,1

The constitution proves him wrong.  It's not just Trump acting like it's a choice whether or not to uphold it.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-05T13:29:06,9
"I've been under this mentality for the last 100 days, but realistically what exactly can Dems do, Impeachment will fail without republican help .   He's getting stopped by some lawsuits by Dems, others he's ignoring   Really in my view, either republicans have to grow a spine or SCOTUS needs to hold him in contempt",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-05T12:37:33,15

"They don't have to vote for Trump's appointees or side with the GOP on anything.  They can still filibuster in the Senate on nearly everything, but they caved on that (thanks Cuck Schumer!)  They can be doing a lot more to resist.  Instead many of them are trying to break bread with MAGA or pretend that this is all just politics as normal, and think that if they stay out of the way things will shift the other way in the next election cycle.  That's not going to work this time.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-06T09:13:45,0

That's progressive dems' line when talking to centrists.  I wish the Dems would start acting like enemies of fascism and MAGA.  Instead they're acting like friends.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-06T09:23:45,0
