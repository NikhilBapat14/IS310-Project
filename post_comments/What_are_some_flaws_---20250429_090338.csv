"The UK electoral system is a straight first-past-the-post system.  It has just enough regional variation for multiple parties to exist, but the FPTP math means that it's still functionally a two-party system.  Which makes it a two-party system with massive built in spoilers.  Which is how one party won 63% of the seats in Parliament last year, despite only winning 34% of the popular vote.       It also has no concept of separation of powers, or a codified constitution, or supermajorities.  But the US has all those things and we aren't doing great so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",Nothing_Better_3_Do,2025-04-29T15:12:07,29
"Thailand's lese-majeste law immediately comes to mind. They have a ""constitutional monarchy"" that nobody is allowed to criticize, including the elected politicians who are supposed to be running the nation on their behalf.",_Abe_Froman_SKOC,2025-04-29T16:24:28,8
"There are 56 candidates vying for the privilege of representing the state of New South Wales in one of six Senate seats at this weekend's Australian federal election. As a consequence, the Senate voting paper is so large it's colloquially known as 'the tablecloth.' And all the options confuse the heck out of people.  Overall, though, I'm happy with Australia's preferential, mandatory voting system. The most frustrating aspect for me is that the media spends most of its time focusing on the two major party candidates most likely to be the prime minister, whereas most voters can only choose between the relatively unknown candidates in their electorate - they can't vote directly for the PM unless they happen to live in their seat.",KahnaKuhl,2025-04-29T15:53:14,6
"Every system that feature FPTP in any kind is note ideal. Even when it's compensated. Germany for example has two votes a ""first vote"" for the constituency candidate and a ""second vote"" for the party list. Ultimately the party list decides how many seats each party gets but which members of the party is decied primarily by the first vote. These candidates some times don't even whin 30 percent and claim they have a right to be in the Bundestag. As I said ultimately the party list is the paramount vote but the first past the post aspect here is still not good.  Switzerland also has de-facto first past the post in cantons/constituencies which only send 1 representative into the National Council. The Swiss system normally has proportional representation. The canton of Zurich sends 36 members while the canton of Uri only sends 1. The problem now is how does proportional representation work if there is only one seat. Short answer: it doesn't. The problem however is less the size of the constituency (even though that is in my opinion also problematic) but that there is no compensation on the national level. The Green Liberal Party (glp) lost 0.25% of the vote in the last election compared to the previous one, But lost 6 seats (3% of seats in the National Council) because there is no nationwide compensation.",Aravinz_HD,2025-04-29T15:35:03,3
One that's in a few proportional voting systems is fixed party list voted. Using Scotland as an example for the additional members you pick the party you want and the people the party put on the list are used to top up the FPTP part starting with whoever the partt chooses as number 1.   Thus you could be in a situation where if you like a party's policies but someone near the top of the list is objectionable to you you have no way of voting against him bit for the party. Other countries have a different system where for the additional members you choose a candidate from the party you want. The votes are tallied up tp find how many additional members each party gets and the x most popular members from that party are admitted.,Prasiatko,2025-04-29T16:44:53,3
"The Canadian system is exactly like the UK system with all of its same flaws.  FPTP, many spoiler 3rd parties, single member districts, all to come together and pick the Head of Government in the council itself, with no real input from the people.  But on top of that, the distribution of districts are also wildly uneven.  Due to the regionalism in the country, small rural Proviences get a lot more represenation than the places where most people actually live.  The average riding in Ontario and British Columbia is 116k but in Manitoba and Saskatchewan it is 95k (81%) and 80k (69%) in each district.  Making voters in Saskatewan about 1/3 more powerful than those in British Columbia and Ontario.    Between the UK and Canada, I would take the UK.  Between Canada and the US... well, they both have their very serious flaws.  Then again, I think that it is important to acknowledge that many system are flawed and to acknowledge it.",Lefaid,2025-04-29T15:20:27,7
"I wouldn't necessarily say that it is a flaw, but a prime minister in many of these systems does not necessarily need to be an MP.  In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the party that won the most votes (the Conservatives) did not win the most seats and therefore did not select the PM.  I am not particularly offended by this, but I didn't hear much screaming and yelling about how unfair this allegedly was.  In the 2019 UK elections, the Tories won a majority of seats and therefore the power to form a government as a majority party even though it received 44% of the popular vote.  The Germans are about to form a coalition government without the second place party being part of it.  The party being excluded is the AfD, so I don't find this to be objectionable.  However, it is arguably not exactly as democratic as it could be.  Of course, constitutional monarchies don't elect or appoint their heads of state, as the roles are hereditary.    In many republics, presidents are appointed rather than elected.  The point is that all election systems have some anomalies and they aren't necessarily bad.  The world seems to have a meltdown over the US electoral college when the Italians (another federal republic) have their own variation of it.  I don't necessarily love the US electoral college -- I would happily see it go if that was possible -- but it isn't going anywhere and it isn't necessarily that odd.  It's really a matter of most people not knowing much about electoral systems elsewhere, so they have no frame of reference and make a lot of inaccurate assumptions.",I405CA,2025-04-29T16:22:54,2
A very minor one but one good thing about FPTP is you have one designated rep who is responsible for your area and you can approach with problems. I live in a fully PR area now and since responsibility for each voting area is distributed across several people and parties you more often than not get fobbed off. Can easily be fixed using the additional member system though.,Prasiatko,2025-04-29T16:46:58,2

"As a Canadian, I am frustrated with both first past the post and the fact that there isn’t an option to vote for both the MP and the prime minister at the same time in a federal election. There are times when I would like to ticket-split but can’t. I also don’t like the fact that there are no open primaries for MP’s and that only paying party members can vote for the party leader.    For better or for worse, it creates a situation where ultimately every MP is an establishment figure unless a surprise in polling happens (ie the surprise wave of NDP rising in the 2011 federal election)",pinkiepie238,2025-04-29T17:28:40,1
"The Portuguese system is based on proportional distribution, organized in electoral districts (each having their own party lists), with MPs apportioned based on population (so the smallest district has two MPs and Lisbon has several dozens).   I think it's fair, for the most part, but in smaller districts there is a severe ""wasted vote"" issue, as there is no national compensation circle. Smaller parties will essentially elect MPs from the larger districts, and have no representation from smaller ones.    Primaries are not unheard of, but are rare. The parties will typically elect leaders between election cycles, and they will also typically head the party list for Lisbon or Porto to ensure the leader is in parliament (not really necessary for larger two parties as they will usually elect MPs from even the smaller districts).   Since I can remember, it's been a mostly two-party system, but smaller parties are well represented. Government formation is led by the election winner, but if they fail to obtain approval in the new parliament, other parties may be called upon to form government instead. Recently the center-left PS was joined in such a way with the liberal-left (Left Bloc) and the Communist Party, after the center-right PSD failed to obtain approval. It was a popular government by all accounts but was unthinkable up to then.   Absolute majorities (50%+) are not the norm, but have happened frequently. PS had one for an year recently, but it was the first in a while.   The current government is led by a center-right coalition and had tacit support from the center-left for major bills. We have an election next month, however (government failed a confidence vote).   Overall, I think it works. Gridlock like in the US has not happened as, fortunately, both centrist parties are able to negotiate major issues. There is, however, a rise in the populist far-right. Parliamentary agreements have become much harder due to this and outright majorities I think are a pipe dream at the moment. No issues in terms of representation, IMO.    FPTP would be an aberration I think, in such a small country. It's worse in every way.",MikeTichondrius,2025-04-29T18:34:30,1

I think there are problems with the British/Australian/Canadian etc system that allows the party in power to choose the Prime Minister. Thinking specifically here about Julia Gillard who used politics within her party to remove the PM and take his role. Such a shame for the first female Prime Minister to get into power that way.

"A good example is the UK electoral system — First Past the Post (FPTP). It has several flaws: 	1.	Unfair results: A party can win a majority in Parliament with only ~40% of the vote. 	2.	Wasted votes: Votes for losing candidates or huge majorities in safe seats don’t count toward national results. 	3.	Tactical voting: People often vote for the “lesser evil” instead of who they actually support. 	4.	Bad for small parties: Parties with nationwide support (like the Greens) get few seats, while regionally strong ones (like the SNP) get many. 	5.	Two-party lock: It discourages new or smaller parties from entering the game.",Any_Bicycle921,2025-05-01T11:17:00,1
"Shoutout to r/EndFPTP. I think the fundamental issue is the way votes are counted. The way math works is that in a plurality system, vote splitting becomes inevitable, which makes similar candidates siphon votes away from each other, which creates an ecosystem where less popular policy candidates when. This inevitably leads to individuals dropping out to back similar candidates, which ultimately leads to the two party primaries system.  Right now there's traction in the Ranked voting reform. But r/EndFPTP points out that while its better than what we currently have, split voting still happens in the last round. Birmingham for instance, banned Ranked after the third place winner won their ranked voting system. Not to say it isn't better than plurality, but it has its flaws and there are better alternatives.  I'm a fan of approval voting. Ranked voting is probably popular because people like the idea of rating candidates. Approval isn't as glamorous, but it solves the two-party issue and is cheaper and easier to understand.

"Your question is too broad. No two nations have the same exact system when you look at the smaller details, and they were all designed with trade-offs very much in mind (let’s not even get into subnational enties).  Part of the reason the US Electoral College is uniquely bad is that the trade-offs in mind had to do with anti-democratic 18th Century political compromises, and all current defenses of the system (as in alleged broader geographic representation) are ex post facto nonsense that doesn’t hold up to scrutiny with historical results.  So short of just directing you to a comparative politics textbook, I will just outline the most general of all its debates: First past the post (as an example of a majoritarian system) vs proportional representation: the former ostensibly produces well-known legislators who are more directly responsible to their consitituents, but often results in parties whose support is too spread out geographically to dissapear into irrelevancy. Proportional representation guarantees that smaller parties will get into the legislature, but ostensibly leads to more fragmented legislatures where majorities are hard to come by, as well as legislators who are less well known by their consituents.",DynaMenace,2025-04-29T15:21:14,1
