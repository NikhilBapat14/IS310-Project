"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_resolution  In particular, bills are used to add, repeal, or amend laws codified in the USC and authorize new spending. Joint resolutions apply to ""smaller items"" (like small appropriations, continuing resolutions, creating temporary commissions, etc.) or ""large items"" (like amending the Constitution, declaring war, national emergency declarations).  At this point, it's likely just tradition that dictates which one is used, but like you said they are functionally identical.",ProLifePanda,2023-04-06T10:07:37,1

"In simple constitutional terms there is no difference between a joint resolution and a bill. Congress is free to adopt whatever name it wishes for its legislation, whether a *joint resolution* or a *bill*. However, Congress has developed its own traditions over the course of 200 years. These traditions include how it characterizes legislation.  Currently, Congress has four types of legislation that it uses. Each of these types have their own special ""enacting clause"" or ""resolving clause"". These four types are:   - Bills, which are normal legislation. This type of legislation needs to be passed by both houses of Congress, and signed by the president, or passed by a 2/3 majority in both houses to overturn a presidential veto. The enacting clause for this type of legislation is *""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled""*.  - Resolutions, which are documents that either change the internal rules or operations of a house, or express the opinion of a house of Congress. These only need to be approved by a single house of Congress. They're resolving clause is simply *""Resolved""*.  - Concurrent Resolutions, which are like normal resolutions except they apply to both houses of Congress. Consequently, they have to be approved by both houses of Congress, but they're not subject to a presidential veto. They're resolving clauses either *""Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring)""* or *""Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring)""*.  - Joint resolutions, these can do anything a bill can do. On top of that they're usually used for extraordinary governmental actions. Joint resolutions have been used to amend the constitution, to declare war, and annex new territory into the United States. Joint resolutions are approved the same way bills are, with the exception of constitutional amendments. Their resolving clause is *""Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled""*.   As I said, constitutionally none of this is required. This all evolved simply as a result of tradition. It's interesting also to look at how Congress named its legislation before the adoption of the Constitution in 1789.   Before The Constitution was adopted Congress usually titled its legislation as ""resolutions"", ""ordinances"", or ""proclamations"". As far as I can tell it wasn't until the adoption of the Constitution that Congress started to title its legislation as ""Acts"", as the British Parliament or state legislatures did. However, even with the adoption of this name for legislation Congress still continue to pass legislation in the form of resolutions, in a seeming hangover from its pre-constitutional history.",PaleontologistOk7794,2023-04-12T19:32:23,1
