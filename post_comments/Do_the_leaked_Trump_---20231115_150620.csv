"Proffers are where an accused negotiating a plea deal is able to truthfully tell the prosecutor everything they know, and the prosecutor cannot use anything said (if they did not have the information from an independent source) in the criminal trial against the accused if no agreement is reached.  The prosecutor can then evaluate what to offer / agree to in terms of reduced charges based on the severity of what is being confessed and/or what the revealed information and potential full co-operation may result in bringing others to justice.",TheNthMan,2023-11-16T06:15:07,11
"The leaked Trump lawyer tapes could potentially impact the defendants and the case in several ways, but it's important to note that the specific legal ramifications can vary depending on various factors. Let's address your questions one by one:  Question 1: Will this cause the case to move to federal court since a jury pool will now be tainted?   The leakage of the proffer videos could indeed raise concerns about the impartiality of the jury pool, especially if it leads to widespread publicity and pretrial publicity that could bias potential jurors. In such cases, the defense may argue for a change of venue or for the case to be moved to federal court, where they might perceive a better chance of obtaining a fair trial. However, whether the case will actually be moved to federal court would ultimately depend on the judge's discretion and the specific circumstances surrounding the case.  Question 2: What are proffers?   Proffers, also known as proffer sessions or proffer agreements, are negotiations between prosecutors and individuals who may have information relevant to a criminal investigation or case. During a proffer session, the individual (often a potential witness or defendant) provides information to the prosecutors, typically in exchange for potential leniency or immunity from prosecution. The information provided during a proffer session is usually given on a ""without prejudice"" basis, meaning it cannot be directly used against the individual in court unless they later provide false information or otherwise breach the terms of the agreement.  Question 3: Is there anywhere where we can watch the full tapes?   I can't provide access to specific leaked materials, as they may be subject to legal restrictions or ethical considerations. It's also important to consider the potential implications of accessing or distributing leaked materials, as doing so could have legal consequences. If these tapes become relevant to legal proceedings, portions of them may be made public through official channels such as court proceedings or legal filings. However, I recommend relying on reputable news sources for updates on the situation and any developments regarding the leaked tapes.",rock_it9,2024-04-30T19:42:27,1
"Yes, I think it’s possible if their attorneys actually have brains. It could provide them some insight to develop a defense to give them some plausible deniability. However, I don’t see that being likely because there is also a pattern of Trump and his cohorts using the lowest rung level lawyers.",Porkchopper913,2023-11-17T09:28:16,1

"Chat GPT to the rescue:   &#x200B;  Leaked information can be used as evidence, but its admissibility will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the leak and the information itself. For example, if the information was obtained **illegally**, it may be inadmissible in court. Additionally, even if the information was obtained **legally**, it may not be considered **reliable or credible** enough to be used as **evidence**. It's important to consult with a legal professional to determine whether leaked information can be used as evidence in a specific case.  &#x200B;  So, i doubt it will be used since the source of the leak is annoymus and it does question it's credibility.",zaplayer20,2023-11-19T16:14:44,0

"Yes, the audio of trump on record specifically saying that he wants to defraud the Georgia presidential and thus the entire american presidential election is a good example of where speech is incriminating.  To make matters worse for trump, this audio is also backed up with fraudulent signed documents as well as testimony of both those in the republican state government and trumps inner circle.  If trump wasn't coddled and babied by the mainstream media and didn't have extensive billionaire backers he would have been locked up long ago.  This is an open and shut case for anyone except someone with as much privilege as trump.     There are over 92 felony charges against the trump crime organization.  Often he is on record admitting to these crimes, but as will all ciminal confessions, he still gets his day in court.  Many of his associates, cabinet members, and criminal business partners have already pled guilty.  The American people have in writing with his signature fraudulent valuations of his business assets, which is a felony and yes he is on record saying specifically he did often de-value his assets for taxes and inflate them for loans.",Educational-Dance-61,2023-11-19T16:58:44,6
"no  it's a violation of a law that says any attempt to influence an election official is illegal in any capacity. ""Be extra careful"" is illegal.  a separate charge is to attempt to influence an election official to falsify a vote. ""I won by a landslide, find me that landslide"" would have been illegal under the first law, but not this one. "" We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I’m just going by small numbers when you add them up they’re many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes."" would be illegal under both laws; he is telling the secretary of state to report a false number.  which is hilarious because he then goes onto say "" Well, under the law you’re not allowed to give faulty election results, OK? You’re not allowed to do that."" when he just tried to convince him to report false numbers.   Threatening an election official is illegal like saying ""And because of what you’ve done to the president, a lot of people aren’t going out to vote and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they’re going to vote. "" when the former president is extremely controlling of his supporters and notoriously vindictive.                 the organized crime part comes from this being only part of a larger organization.",roastbeeftacohat,2023-12-19T18:00:20,1

You reference things but I want to discuss those things very specifically so that I understand the illegality.

""All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes""   If I go into a convenience store and say find me $11,000 you owe it to me and point my finger at the teller through my hoodie pocket, there is no valid defence that says ""he never said this is a stick up, give me all the money.""

"It is against the law to lie to a bank when getting a loan.
