Seems logical to me that all murders would be eligible for the death penalty.,GentryMillMadMan,2025-05-09T07:12:57,205
They aren't already?,MMcDeer,2025-05-09T09:06:52,43
And let’s get all those appeals done in under 10 years. No more taxpayer funded decay rotting away on death row for decades.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T08:24:28,48
"while this is a good thing, does this run any risk of becoming a major international incident? (or is that less of  concern since these countries in many cases have made it very clear they don't want their citizens back that come here illegally)",reaper527,2025-05-09T09:03:42,17

Does that count as a deportation?,Zilver_Zurfer,2025-05-09T11:19:31,4
"IMO, we need to go even further. If an illegal immigrant is convicted of ANY violent crime, the mandatory sentence should be life in prison with no chance of parole, no exceptions. If a legal immigrant (non-citizen) is convicted of ANY  crime, the mandatory sentence should be the maximum punishment for that  crime, and after serving it, immediate deportation.",ajmacbeth,2025-05-09T07:58:18,-22

This is my position. One step closer to actual justice.,crash______says,2025-05-09T10:18:52,17
"They should be. Even if that were the standard for a murder case, we might need additional laws when it comes to illegal aliens. It gets kinda funky on an international relations level when you try to execute someone from a foreign country.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-09T12:35:04,5
I don’t think it’s that long in countries like China.     Those serial killers on death row…they really aren’t on death row. The victims are the ones who died. They are the ones who suffered.,Imagoof4e,2025-05-09T09:11:55,6
"Yes, if for no other reason than than a foreign politician wants to make a scene to prop up domestic support.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-09T09:39:50,6
"My undergrad degree is in criminal justice and this was a topic that came up frequently. We were taught that banning the death penalty for sexual assault is actually to protect the child.  If the criminal penalty for rape is the same as murder, it’s now in the rapists best interest to also murder their victim. A dead person can’t call them out.  Honestly I don’t know how I feel about this. Of course I want a rapist to to suffer the worst fate imaginable, but if the laws are in place to protect the victims I don’t necessarily want them changed either",GovernmentLow4989,2025-05-09T13:53:48,30
"Shouldn't the penalty be harsh enough to dissuade the crime in the first place?  In today's society it seems that we treat criminals too tenderly and as a result they have no real fear of committing a crime.  So if I wanted to rape someone, but I knew that if I did, I would be killed, if that wasn't enough to dissuade me nothing would.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T14:37:14,2
