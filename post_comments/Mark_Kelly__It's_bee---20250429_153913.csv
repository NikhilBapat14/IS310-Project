"It's up to us to increase pressure and protest, call, and email all the representatives, every damned day we can, and demand they join Congressman Shri Thanedar to impeach and remove Trump.",[deleted],2025-04-29T19:25:05,5
"It’d be great if someone such as Mark Kelly would already start campaigning for the 2028 POTUS position along with a solid sidekick veep.  This would get airtime.  Would make people realize there’s an option ahead.  And he would have endless fodder to support his campaign against djt as the next “proper” POTUS.  Hell, maybe even expedite the process if all hell seriously breaks loose - but people need to be educated about the flipside to this current tyranny.  Without it there’s no point of reference.  MAGA all digest bullshit news-streams that are just echo-chambers of the same nonsense.  Someone needs to get in front of all of this and start showing the illegalities, unconstitutional acts, dysfunction, etc so that THEY start taking on some of the spotlight.  Because rn even media outlets are “fearful of retribution”, like, WITAF?!?!  Just my $0.02",WetFinsFine,2025-04-30T01:32:36,5
"Yeah, more Dems need to take advantage of the media's desire for a story and give them one that delivers a message of resistance.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-01T03:46:14,2
"Right now I think most MSM is in a state of corporate capitulation - we’ve seen the lawsuits and we’ve seen many settle.  It’s fucked.  But if there was an active candidate campaign for 2028 POTUS, they couldn’t back away from that.  It would have to take center stage (at least the yin to djt’s yang so to speak).  Sure - TOTALLY premature; but thus far NOTHING about this current administration is “normal” so I think it’s high time to combat it and its airtime with non-normal strategies.",WetFinsFine,2025-05-01T04:17:41,2
"Exactly, start breaking these stupid rules of politics people have chucky have bound themselves to and make a scene even a capitulated media can't ignore. If that means running for 2028 now, do it.  Once you have their eyes send a message, not a strongly worded letter.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-01T04:25:18,2
