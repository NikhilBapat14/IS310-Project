"Wait, didn't I see that the national parks make like 12 times what their annual budget is?  Why do they need funding if they make way more than enough to sustain themselves?     In 2023, National Park visitors spending contributed a record high $55.6 billion to the U.S. economy, supporting 415,000 jobs. This significant economic impact was generated from visitor spending in local gateway communities surrounding the parks. The National Park Service itself received $3.475 billion in taxpayer funding in 2024. Here's a breakdown of the economic impact:  * **Visitor Spending:** National Park visitors spent an estimated $26.4 billion in local gateway regions.  * **Economic Output:** This spending generated a total of $55.6 billion in economic output in the national economy.  * **Jobs Supported:** The spending supported 415,000 jobs.  * **Value Added:** The spending also contributed $32.0 billion in value added to the national economy.  * **Labor Income:** $19.4 billion in labor income was generated by visitor spending.   The National Park Service report highlights the substantial economic benefits national parks provide to both local communities and the nation as a whole. ",scrapqueen,2025-05-05T19:14:46,144
"For one, I have no idea what the actual details are on the cuts, and no idea if this ""source"" is trustworthy.  The article reads like a lobbyist wrote it, so I'm taking it with an incredible grain of salt.  With that said, if the suggestion is that there is no waste to cut in the NPS, or that there isn't a more efficient operating model (Idaho has no national parks at all and does a fine job of enabling people to still get full use of the land), then we should seriously slap ourselves in the face and wake up to reality.  Government spending is out of control.  Nothing is off the table.  That includes entitlements, imo, though I know no one has the stones to touch it.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-05T19:17:08,-91
"Most Libs are willing to concede that we need to cut the deficit, but whenever it comes to specifics, they balk. They say we shouldn't touch entitlements, we shouldn't abolish the DoE, we shouldn't touch funding for NPR or PBS, we shouldn't touch foreign aid, and now....we shouldn't touch funding for National Parks.  Message to Libs....the cuts have to come from SOMEwhere!",Vessarionovich,2025-05-05T19:06:27,-116
Why is it always the unflaired users with like a dozen posts for a year who post these BS posts?,MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-05T20:00:50,-82
The land isn’t going anywhere. Just keep the land in a protected state where it can’t be developed in and that’s all we need.,Cylerhusk,2025-05-06T06:06:32,-22
It's one of the wokest agencies and is getting greatly taken advantage of by illegal immigrants.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T19:33:50,-188
"So you’re suggesting federal contribution be nixed and the parks given the ability to tax their local communities directly to fund them?  Just to be clear I mean.. because that 12:1 figure you threw out sounds like a damned good investment economically, not to mention the cultural and ecological benefits of the NPS, so I figured you might have a better suggestion?",niresangwa,2025-05-05T20:06:09,526
Tbh what sucks is in Texas for example there's nearly no national land for recreational use.,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-05-05T20:18:22,122
"NPCA is a lobbyist group, so they're just a wee bit biased. Their projections are doom and gloom scare tactics...there's no way the government will shutter 350 parks.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T20:06:34,-41
"**Choose One**    1.  **☐**   Cheaper national park visits  2.  **☐**  Get budget and debt under control so the US doesn’t default on debt payments, tank the dollar to worthless, create a worldwide depression that makes the Great Depression look like a Sunday Stroll in the park            If we keep clutching our pearls and hyperventilating over every proposed cut, option 2 above is our future",cliffotn,2025-05-05T19:36:36,-78

"It's federal land that the park service runs.  The revnenue it produces is more than sufficient to run the parks, so why does it need taxpayer subsidy?  And if we are treating it like an investment - the money should be repaid to the government, shouldn't it?  But no - the park service gets tax money, then makes twelve times that amount in revenue.  So why does it need funding at all?",scrapqueen,2025-05-06T13:21:27,0
Your logic doesn’t work. Because you know what is a better investment is a 12:0 investment scheme.,sixtysecdragon,2025-05-05T22:20:18,-182
So much land in Texas. Is it mostly privately owned?,bearcatjoe,2025-05-05T20:20:43,44
"I’m unsure whether you’re being intentionally obtuse or not.  That 56Bn doesn’t stay with the NPS. It’s referring to jobs it provides, businesses outside of the parks around them, service and tourist businesses; these entities then pay taxes to the federal, state and local governments.  The NPS keeps only its gate and its concessions/licensing/fees. This isn’t enough to support the parks themselves, with them struggling with deferred maintenance the same as other types of national intra/infrastructure.  So again, if you withdraw the federal contribution, how do continue to fund the NPS? Would you suggest new taxes be applied to local regions? If so, would they replace or be in addition to federal and state taxes those businesses already pay?  It would to seem to me, that’s unnecessarily burdensome, no?   What’s your suggestion, given you seem to want to withdraw federal assistance? Surely you have an idea on what you would do that would be ‘better’?",niresangwa,2025-05-06T14:25:12,12
Are you telling me you think the $55.6B is from park admissions and park shop sales?,niresangwa,2025-05-05T22:42:17,140
Yes. Privately owned and mostly undeveloped. Just people holding onto stakes of land for generations. Lots of trespassers will be prosecuted and trespassers will be shot signs too,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-05-05T20:25:01,119

"Selling it to developers when the time comes around. It's pretty sad. If you go to Davy Crockett national forest, most of the trail goes right between private land. The trail got damaged in a hurricane a few years ago. Due to being privately owned on both sides of the trail, the owners don't have incentives to fix it so it's remained closed 3/4s of the way",Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-05-05T20:42:33,90
