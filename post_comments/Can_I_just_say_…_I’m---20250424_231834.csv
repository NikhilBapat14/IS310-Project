"Her ""100 Day Return"" is almost up. And ""MSNBC"" is separating from ""NBC Universal,"" the massive conglomerate that keeps all those closet Republicans on the channel (like that Joe asshole).  I'm looking forward to a REAL alternative to rightwing cable propaganda dominance.",YallerDawg,2025-04-25T06:52:05,4
MAGA will have to basically say everything now they see around them is fake news,shadowpawn,2025-04-25T07:24:43,5
Honestly she could take over the entire nightly host list and I‚Äôd be delighted. No disrespect to the other hosts but Maddow is an actual investigative journalist.,figuring_ItOut12,2025-04-25T10:30:54,4

This gives me hope. I have been so scared and literally bought a book on how to survive martial law because I‚Äôve been thinking doomsday. The interview Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell did recently in Ireland on why she left the US also scared me. AND the new Handmaid‚Äôs tale episodes just make me freak the hell out lol,Pale_Fig_4488,2025-04-25T08:34:29,2

"Stop watching cable news. They‚Äôre nothing but merchants of comfort and antagonism.  Edit: Tell me how I‚Äôm wrong folks. This is literally the reason that cable news originally existed, to scare you and then make you feel better about it so you‚Äôll watch longer and see more ads.  Watch actual news devoid of opinions and spins as much as possible. Nothing else.",JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-24T23:30:48,-28
She really would. I‚Äôd vote for her.,Extreme_Succotash784,2025-04-25T04:49:47,7

She was reading stats from polls and saying ‚Äúhe got shot down by this judge and that judge and this judge‚Äù.   Sure she was saying it with glee but the clear cut facts were there.,Chiquitarita298,2025-04-25T01:54:49,9

Your choice. I just know that the ‚Äústickin‚Äô it to ‚Äòem‚Äù drama is what draws viewers and perpetuates toxicity. Give me local news 10/10 times for information highlights to possibly dig into deeper later.,JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-25T00:07:22,-10

"I am a big fan of local news and have even been involved in it. Unfortunately it's rarer and rarer to find, with huge corporations buying up all of our local TV and radio stations and newspapers.  And from my time there, it always was, at least in television, an 'if it bleeds it leads' motto. Still, the best you can do is take the good where you find it, and keep looking until you do.  To a lot of us, Rachel Maddow is one of those good things. In fact, as we fight against rising autocracy in our country, she is one of the most important voices in the fight against the terrible things that are happening. She gives us hope. And I, for one, pray for her safety.  https://preview.redd.it/jhgya85hcxwe1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4aeca413cc8cad6f4593a0545d1ae5ddc54a293",Think-Hospital7422,2025-04-25T01:22:32,9
You mean the local news that is like 80%+ owned by Fox in the US?,Chiquitarita298,2025-04-25T01:53:43,3
That‚Äôs not her normal demeanor. She‚Äôs entitled to occasional moments of schadenfreude. In the meantime take some of your own advice and listen to her investigative podcasts. It‚Äôs graduate school level discourse and always multiply sourced.,figuring_ItOut12,2025-04-25T10:35:33,3
