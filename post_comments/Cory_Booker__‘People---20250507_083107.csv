"I think this is a big problem for the Democratic Party. Say what you want about Republicans, but they convinced a lot of non-MAGA people in the last election that they cared. Whether they do or not is an entirely different debate, but they convinced them.  Democrats feel disconnected. Nobody believes in leadership.

Poor Booker's feet hurt from standing and ass hurts from sitting. Sorry. Not impressed. How does this writer compose this with a straight face? He's a sell out who thinks we're stupid and it's obvious what the party is doing. Prescribing to us what they think we deserve in a candidate based on a disdain for change. They point at a pile of poop, sprinkle it with glitter and ask how we can be so audacious to not jump for joy. We need to stay vocal on this at every turn or we're going to get the same old crap over and over and over. Things will not change if we keep allowing the party to tell us what our expectations should be, where the bar should be set, as opposed to voters telling the party where we stand and demanding better.

"Still a false equivalence, though.  I firmly believe that some Dems are literally controlled opposition, but only a handful of them.  As a whole it's the difference between incompetence and intentional malice.  The Dems can be reformed by primarying the problem politicians and can actually be coaxed into doing something good if there is enough public support for it, but the GOP are nothing but a force for evil, especially today.  Part of the problem with Democrats is that they're the catch-all party for anyone who isn't on board with the fascism or racism the GOP has been embracing for decades, so it's nearly impossible for Dems to agree on anything except that they're not Republicans.  The views are far too diverse among its members, and that includes the voters.  The reason there are so many centrist democrats is because there are a lot of centrist voters who are really conservatives and don't want change.  If the GOP were a true conservative party and not a fascist cult, many of them would probably be republicans, or at least vote for them.  This leaves the more progressive voters feeling disenfranchised by the party, because it's a lot easier to stop change than it is to cause it, and unless the entire party is on board there is no way to actually make it happen.  IMO this is why so many people don't vote, because they feel neither party represents them or is working to change our broken system in a way that would make things better.  One party wants to maintain the status quo, and the other is actively making it worse.  The Democratic party needs reform, badly, and it needs to find its identity and start to stand for something or it will continue to bleed voters as they become more and more disillusioned.  But maintaining the status quo is still better than heading full speed toward a cliff, so it absolutely matters who is in power.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-08T08:52:08,1

I can appreciate that you’re trying to be pragmatic and believe the same of the dems but look at the evidence. They want the same things as the republicans. One of Kamala’s positions was that she would be even stronger on the border than Trump. The dems are being strategic in that they put up a token fight but have no real desire to govern. Look at people like pelosi making all of her money insider trading. Where has Kamala been since she lost? Signed with a talent agent so she can go on speaking tours. They do not care about you. They are counting on you sticking up for them saying “well what are they supposed to do?” “They don’t have the power to do anything” “it would go against decorum”. The dems need an overhaul of leadership. The old guard is fat and happy in trump’s america. They do not select the best candidates to run for them. They select them based on seniority. Look at the ancient clown they had installed as head of the oversight committee instead of AOC. He’d just been there a long time and was “due”. And now he’s stepping down months later because of ill health. Same thing with Biden. The list goes on man.,3LM,2025-05-07T09:42:41,5
"Not necessarily true. We're seeing a few really start to elevate themselves. AOC and Sanders tour has been amazing for boosting morale and awareness. Crockett can turn Trump's own energy back at him in a much more clever way. Murphy has gotten incredibly good at explaining thongs in clear ways for the public to understand. Booker's stunt did a lot to start rallying the public. We saw a congressman pressuring El Salvador directly was able to at least get info and slightly change Kilmer Abrego Garcia's situation. There is some power left if they're clever enough to use it. Inspiration is doing something   The real power, however, likely lies with the states. States rights is a real thing Republicans weaponized when they did not have as much influence. Democrats need to follow their playbook now. Trump, despite what he thinks, is not above the Governors. This system is very deliberate to provide mechanisms for taking power away when one part of the government gets too strong. What our founding fathers hated more than anything was a king. Everything they did was to safeguard against another George III. Trump is our George III, straight down to the likely being mentally unwell. We're being tested again 250 years in, and we cannot fail",whichwitch9,2025-05-07T10:33:17,1

"Here’s the thing though, if some are literally controlled opposition, that means they are helping the gop and therefore “the same” side. Not to mention that the senate has fewer than 50 senators for the dems and if say like 8 yield to the opposition that’s like 20% of the party there. They only need a handful to achieve their plans, especially when it’s leadership.   Then because of the lack of ideals, they never try to attack or punish the gop for shit they do, and the party refuses to allow internal criticism.

"Veterans’ Access to Care Through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act (2014) → This was indeed signed into law (Public Law No: 113-146), not just left in committee. It was a major bipartisan veterans’ reform bill after the VA wait-time scandal.  Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act (2013) → This also became law (Public Law No: 113-52), ensuring veterans’ benefits kept up with inflation.  Amendments for community health centers and Federal Reserve transparency → These were amendments, not standalone bills, but amendments can absolutely become law if they’re attached to larger passed legislation (like the Affordable Care Act or Dodd-Frank). Sanders did successfully push an amendment to audit the Fed’s emergency lending during the financial crisis, which passed.  So, the claim that these are “just in committee” or “performative” misrepresents that some of these were actually passed and had real effects, even if many Sanders-sponsored standalone bills did fail (which is common for many senators, especially those with outsider politics).
