"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > The Federal Reserve’s incoming top banking cop is seeking to review the confidential ratings for the health of large banks, after criticizing the fact that two-thirds of the biggest institutions were deemed unsatisfactory last year.  > Michelle Bowman, who was nominated by President Trump for vice chair for supervision at the Fed, has been expected to bring a lighter hand to bank regulation if she is approved by the Senate for the job. In a February speech she questioned the Fed’s recent supervisory ratings, saying there was an “odd mismatch” between the central bank’s views of the financial condition of the largest banks and the unsatisfactory ratings it gave many of them last year.  > The Fed hasn’t yet released new supervisory ratings for U.S. bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in assets, according to people familiar with the matter, even though it typically shares the ratings privately by the end of March. The Fed is planning to wait until Bowman is confirmed by the Senate for her new role, some of the people said.   > The pause is unusual, and the ratings have already gone through several layers of review at the central bank. Some bank examiners would likely raise concerns if any changes are made, some of the people said.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-02T22:51:22,3
