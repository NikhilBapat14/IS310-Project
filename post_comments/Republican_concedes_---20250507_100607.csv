"I'm shocked that Griffin didn't appeal the decision (he was given an opportunity to). It's obviously great news, but I think the NC court is still like 5-2 republican majority unfortunately. Also, the republicans just successfully managed to wrestle control of elections away from the (Democratic) governor's office and into their own hands. And comically, they say it's for ensuring election integrity and calling for ""trust"" in NC elections. LMAO.

"I am not really sure what to make of this.  On the one hand, I get the idea that an election might be rigged and all of that.  Yet, at some point it becomes obsession and then desperation.  I mean, what kind of look is the NC GOP sending?  Or trying to send?   It seems like beyond grasping at straws.",crucial_geek,2025-05-07T19:36:09,1
