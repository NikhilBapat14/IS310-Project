">As to Canada, Trump said ""Well, I think we're not going to ever get to that point. It could happen.""  >As to Greeland, though, he was firmer: ""Something could happen with Greenland. I'll be honest, we need that for national and international security.""  What the..?!? His comment about Canada contradicts itself. And his comment about Greenland is disturbing...  And no one had better say ""He's just joking"" or "" He's just trying to trigger the libs."" Stop making excuses for him. He has repeatedly threatened the sovereignty of other countries and that's not okay. Don't just brush it off.",sachiprecious,2025-05-04T11:51:42,15

"Outrageously unfit to lead. Just this weekends statements - pretending to be the pope, questioning his commitment to uphold the constitution while attacking due process, his ambition to takeover Canada and Greenland (probably not by force).

He's all talk.  That's all he is.  Push back and he will fold like a lawn chair.,Kantsas,2025-05-04T11:59:48,2
There was not going to be any military action. For him to do so U.S. would have to go to war with U..K. Trump is likely more interested in building a Trump Tower hoping for a good deal and resolving the tariff issue so we do not go back to riding horses and using buggies.,PsychLegalMind,2025-05-04T11:32:51,3
Why does the US want an enemy in the other side of a 3000km undefended border? The south border is a real crisis while the north border is as peaceful as it gets. Why do you want another southern border crisis in the north?,__TheWaySheGoes,2025-05-04T12:05:38,1
"so theres his comments on canada, greenland, AND iran that makes he think hes eventually gonna start world war 3 and maybe a civil war in the united states if hes as serious as we think he is and he goes through with things",saiyanscaris,2025-05-04T12:47:58,1

"The whole reasons why Geneva Conventions even exist is because how bad ass Canadians fought in both World wars..Trump also forgot that King Charles III owns Canada.

"He's definitely pathetic and weak, but the issue is that he's hiding behind a powerful military. He's a weasel, but the American people elected that weasel into office, giving him command of too much power for anyone person...

"There was a Trump Tower in Toronto. It went as well as you might expect. Inflated rates and occupancy followed by a shit ton of lawsuits.   .   Most hilariously, glossy brochures found in the suites’ nightstands offered a tour of The Hockey Hall of Fame by (then Leaf) James van Riemsdyk.

"Constantly spamming this meme just makes us sound like a joke.   And not for nothing, the initial geneva convention was written in the 1860s. So while the ""Geneva Conventions"" as we know them are a result of rules codified after WW2, they absolutely do not ""exist because of canada during the world wars""",SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-04T12:38:17,3

"I mean, I hear what you're saying, and I think Trump is an absolute dumbass, but number one: the Geneva conventions were not created because of the Canadians. And number two: as fierce as the Canadians were in WW1 and WW2, Canadian military procurement causes my psychological damage and has led me to doubt in their ability to take on the US armed forces.",TheSharkTerminator,2025-05-04T11:46:08,-1
