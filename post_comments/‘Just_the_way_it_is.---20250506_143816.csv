"He stood up and left.   At least it would have been the right thing to do. But Trump needn‚Äôt worry, the stuff Canada isn‚Äôt selling to the US anymore, they sell somewhere else now.

"In 2008, the largest residential property sale in US history to that point was made.  A man bought a billionaires former estate, 4x over what Trump had paid for the property, which was already WELL over what it was worth. This was a mansion he and the estate had let sit abandoned for \~5 years up to that point. Everyone called Trump a fool when he bought that property at the price he did, as it was considered too much. After he failed multiple times to get permits to build a golf course on it, he tried to sell it for years. Never any takers until this guy.  After the man bought the property, it was immediately bulldozed and resold to a condo development company at a lost.  Who bought it from Trump? A Russian oligarch who would later be listed in sanctions against Russia under Obama for his involvement in ""unrelated"" election interference.  His indebtedness to Russia started long before that, but that was enough money to bail them out of the 2008/2009 real estate price collapse, which otherwise would have bankrupted the company 2x over if Trump couldn't sell this property.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-06T15:09:20,10
