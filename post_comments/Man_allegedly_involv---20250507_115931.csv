">However, they have no right to destroy my life over free speech and ultimately something that was an edgy joke.   The government has no right to restrict free speech. A private business can totally make your free speech known and other private citizens can use their own rights to free speech to say what they will. Any threats or attacks that rise to the level of crimes should be prosecuted, but doing an unpopular thing or giving air time to an unpopular thing might just make you unpopular.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-07T13:34:38,23

"An ""edgy joke""?!  Jokes are suppose to be funny... a hate sign is not funny.  And now, as if Kahn wasn't a big enough joke of his own accord, he now wants to fundraise off of it?!   If Dave Portnoy starts his own fundraiser, I will happily contribute to THAT ONE.   Keep up the good fight, Dave! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",Ida_PotatHo,2025-05-08T14:11:32,3
