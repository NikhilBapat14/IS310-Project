“insiders wonder if he can outsmart JD Vance to win the 2028 Republican nomination”  I’ve seen enough Republican primaries to know smart has nothing to do with it.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-07T16:24:31,12

"Americans will vote for a woman before they vote for Marco as President. It cannot be overstated just how much of a beta most people, including MAGA, see him as. There is no way he ever becomes president of the United States.  Sadly, in reality he'd still probably actually be a better choice than anyone else in the current administration.",bravetailor,2025-05-07T16:33:57,4

Doesn't his Spanish-sounding name already preclude him from being the nominee because he belongs to the bigotry party?,thieh,2025-05-07T16:33:33,1
"No, it will make him a jailbird when Trump is out of the picture. Evil never wins, you don’t get to deport a toddler who is a US citizen who is under going cancer treatment and now will DIE because they now have no access to the medical care they NEED.

Rubio and Vance are the frontrunners for GOP 2028. DeSantis may have lost his opportunity. Vivek will likely become governor of Ohio.,foochacho,2025-05-07T17:16:08,1

"I mean you did vote for Trump… who has 34 felonies and was found guilty on each one, has a lengthy flight log to Epstein’s island, has had over 20 SA allegations two of which proven to be true in court and he was ordered to pay, it’s known that trump gRaped a teenage girl then threw money at her and told her to get an abortion, has held the Bible backwards and upside down and claimed to be Christian while disrespecting the position of the pope (but honestly not surprised that a kiddie diddler wants to be pope.. kind of their thing…) his now deceased ex wife told the Trump forced himself on her.. and then threatened by trump into silence, and when she passed trump buried her on the golf course for tax benefits and now the grave is overgrown you can’t even see where it is now…    Like I honestly could go on… and on… and on… but you’ll just find a way to dismiss and/or justify Trump…   Anyways my point is… you make bad decisions… and you just voiced another one.. If you’re capable of listening to reason and not lashing out because someone is putting the reality in your face then there is hope for you.   I hope you see that the Republican Party isn’t what it once was, it’s filled with horrible people who want to make the rich richer while also taking us back to the early 1800s in the worst way.",Dapper-Today-6364,2025-05-07T16:48:01,-1
"Now that’s what they’re looking for. But I have a hard time believing the people that are still all in on Trump are going to be willing to build a cult of personality around the bland and uncomfortable Vance or Rubio, the minority with Cuban heritage.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-07T16:48:03,3
That’s where we are as a country. The fact that he could even make the primary of a major party is a shame.,AmrokMC,2025-05-07T16:26:55,3

"I said I’d vote for Rubio in the Republican primary, but not the general election. Think it through, and learn to vote tactically.  It matters tremendously who wins the Republican primary. Why? Because half the time, on average, the Republican candidate will win. Had Nikki Haley (whom I voted for in the 2024 primary), or even Ron DeSantis won the Republican primary, the world would not be nearly as fucked as it is rapidly becoming.   “Oh,” I can hear you wondering, “Why didn’t you vote in the Democratic primary, if you’re such a committed progressive?”  **Because they didn’t fucking have one.**  Look, there are many reasons why Democrats across the country register as Republicans: participate in their internal polls; let them waste money on mailings; vote for the least-bad-choice on the oppo ticket.  And if there is a chance that America will elect a Republican president in 2028 — and 2000, 2004, 2016 and 2024 suggest there’s a pretty big chance — then expressing a choice in that Republican nominee seems pretty important. Some states have “open primaries” allowing anyone to vote in any primary, but many do not.  I stand by my statement: of the many potential candidates the GOP might put forward for 2028, Rubio is far from the worst.",mzieg,2025-05-07T18:37:07,-1
"First of all there is no need for profanity. Second everything you just said just proves my point and you don’t understand how self sabotaging you’re being 😮‍💨. Yeah you definitely support Trump, you don’t care about people you just want your party to win regardless of if their policies are actually beneficial to the American people. It’s very clear you’re part of the problem and aren’t going to learn…  Recently republicans were asked a question. Here is the video… this is the type of party you are supporting… a party who is ok with deporting a toddler who is a us citizen and has cancer…   Republicans start wars, they cut funding for education, they re introduced segregation, they are deporting US citizens without due process which is illegal regardless if they are citizens or not, they are the reason we are headed into a recession, they are the reason farmers are struggling, they are the reason the ports are currently near empty, and they are the reason truck drivers among others are being laid off…   Like please stop living in delulu land and stop voting against your own interests.   Actually take the time to look at the voting records of republicans, if you do you will see they are not for you.   I’m sorry you’ve been misled like this but I’m just telling you the truth even if you will ignore me and be disrespectful.   Have a blessed life. Goodbye.
