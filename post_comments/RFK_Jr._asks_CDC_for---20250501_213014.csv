"This dude wants future vaccines tested against placebos. Okay. But let’s test RFK Jr’s bogus treatments against the same placebos.   Better yet, let’s test RFK Jr’s bogus treatments on measles patients against previously vaccinated (and non-measles) people.",ranchoparksteve,2025-05-01T21:49:54,9

">Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop new guidance for treating measles with drugs and vitamins, an HHS spokesperson said.  >The move comes as Kennedy has faced criticism during this year's record measles outbreaks for remarks misleading people into thinking that measles infections are easily curable and inflating myths about measles vaccines. Vaccination is the only way to prevent the highly infectious disease that can cause serious health complications or death in some cases.  It's because he doesn't believe in the well established Germ Theory of modern medicine:  [RFK Jr. rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-stance-is-rooted-in-a-disbelief-in-germ-theory/)  >Germ theory is, of course, the 19th-century proven idea that microscopic germs—pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi—cause disease. It supplanted the leading explanation of disease at the time, the miasma theory, which suggests that diseases are caused by miasma, that is, noxious mists and vapors, or simply bad air arising from decaying matter, such as corpses, sewage, or rotting vegetables. While the miasma theory was abandoned, it is credited with spurring improvements in sanitation and hygiene—which, of course, improve health because they halt the spread of germs, the cause of diseases.  >Germ theory also knocks back a lesser-known idea called the terrain theory, which we've covered before. This is a somewhat ill-defined theory that generally suggests diseases stem from imbalances in the internal ""terrain"" of the body, such as malnutrition or the presence of toxic substances. The theory is linked to ideas by French scientist Antoine Béchamp and French physiologist Claude Bernard.   ...   It's important to note here that our understanding of Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory isn't based on speculation or deduction; it's based on Kennedy's own words. He wrote an entire section on it in his 2021 book vilifying Fauci, titled The Real Anthony Fauci. The section is titled ""Miasma vs. Germ Theory,"" in the chapter ""The White Man's Burden.""   ...   In the chapter, Kennedy promotes the ""miasma theory"" but gets the definition completely wrong. Instead of actual miasma theory, he describes something more like terrain theory. He writes: ""'Miasma theory' emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and by reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses.""   ...   In all, the chapter provides a clear explanation of why Kennedy relentlessly attacks evidence-based medicines; vilifies the pharmaceutical industry; suggests HIV doesn't cause AIDS and antidepressants are behind mass shootings; believes that vaccines are harmful, not protective; claims 5G wireless networks cause cancer; suggests chemicals in water are changing children's gender identities; and is quick to promote supplements to prevent and treat diseases, such as recently recommending vitamin A for measles and falsely claiming children who die from the viral infection are malnourished.",brain_overclocked,2025-05-02T03:03:10,2

Someone just responded to me on Instagram about how measles isn't that bad and her relatives had it when they were younger. Bringing up how the Brady Bunch even joked about it having measles parties. I don't get society anymore. Like we really are moving backwards.,mces97,2025-05-01T21:43:07,11

"I had a bad reaction to the MMR because I can’t handle live virus vaccines, apparently, and if getting actual measles feels that bad or worse, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, even though I knew there was no chance of it killing me. It’s one of the worst things I’ve experienced, health wise, and I had a dry socket after getting my wisdom teeth out.   This is a big reason why the most people possible need to get vaccinated, there are people who aren’t able to get some vaccines, and herd immunity keeps them alive.",downhereforyoursoul,2025-05-01T22:12:55,7

"Exactly. I'm sure that experience sucked, and I also assume you understand that was very rare and just bad luck/genetics. But people not vaccinating and letting measles spread is going to do so much harm to society. And I can't help but feel the powers that he know this and want that. They want a dumb, easily controlled population, and making disease run rampant is one way of doing that.",mces97,2025-05-01T22:18:41,3
"Yeah, at the health department, they said it only happens to like 5% of people. I have chronic health issues so that may be part of why I was unlucky, and I am very supportive of vaccination.
