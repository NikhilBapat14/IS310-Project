I have to wonder who they are even polling? Iâ€™ve literally never gotten polled and no one I know has either,CurlyCupcake1231,2025-04-29T15:55:50,25
"It's interesting that TEXAS is the same color as Michigan and Pennsylvania.   Interesting but no suprise. Trump, Musk, ICE, oil & gas, and  religious nutjobs have been using TX as a testing ground for their worst policies and are running that state into the ground.   It's also hard to blame democrats for Texas, considering how long the GOP has been at the helm.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-29T16:23:18,8
"Wait, wait...so Wyoming can just go fuck itself. They think he's 100% perfect? No one disapproves? Yeah, Wyoming, you are trash.",snarkerella,2025-04-29T22:19:40,3
"As usual it showing the United States has at least 50% of the stupidest, meanest, most hateful, people, what a statistic.  The great American Christian hypocrisy.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-29T18:40:39,5

"I don't know which it was for but at the end of 2020 I did answer questions for about 10 minutes that had to be included in one of these. I'm 42, so only one time I've ever been represented in any of these. I think I broke the law and answered a call from an unknown number, I don't usually pick up but it was a formal survey and I was happy to be a data point.",PNWoutdoors,2025-04-29T23:10:20,1
The Texas Republicans are more than up for that challenge.,specqq,2025-04-29T16:35:54,9
You're probably right. They have gerrymandered that state to smithereens,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-29T16:37:24,7

You are right but how does Ted Cruz manage to get reelected?,homerjs225,2025-04-30T04:57:32,2
"They'll vote for anyone/anything with an ""R"" next to their name. Letting a Democrat win is a cardinal sin.",jml510,2025-04-30T08:17:03,1
