He wants an attorney fired from his company because he's mad at the college he attended?    And for clarity we're talking about the oldest institution of higher learning in America whose graduates account for 8 Presidents.    I think this is all because Obama went there and he was the President of the Harvard Law Review.  Trump can't credit him with those achievements and therefore it's because the institution is DEI.,Searchlights,2025-04-24T10:35:10,823
