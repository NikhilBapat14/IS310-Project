"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)  By Anjali Huynh  As Democratic voters have¬†[increasingly shouted for their elected officials](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/10/metro/massachusetts-democrats-trump-musk-letter-protest-schumer/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)¬†to more forcefully push back on President Trump ahead of¬†[his first 100 days in office](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/26/nation/trump-first-100-days-new-england/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), Massachusetts state senators seem to have gotten the message.  A group of Democratic state senators, including Senate President Karen Spilka, took to the floor during an informal session Monday to address the sweeping changes and upending of political norms unleashed by¬†Trump, criticizing his approach to the law and his actions in areas such as immigration, health care, and LGBTQ rights. Some also demanded the state‚Äôs all-Democrat congressional delegation do more to fight the president.  Spilka, in her most forceful criticism of the Trump administration yet, said the United States is being ‚Äúforcefully remade‚Äù into an ‚Äúunchecked authoritarian regime‚Äù and joined the chorus of left-leaning voters calling on Congress to stop his administration‚Äôs actions.  ‚ÄúAs someone who lost family members to the Holocaust, I do not say this lightly, but what we are experiencing in America today is starting to feel like Europe in the 1930s,‚Äù Spilka said in her 20-minute speech. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just terrifying, it is enraging ‚Äî this is not who we are.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe must demand more from our elected representatives in Congress to act as the check on unfettered executive power that the Constitution demands of them,‚Äù she later added.  Massachusetts state lawmakers have slowly become more vocal in opposing the administration as their¬†[constituents have protested changes](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/15/metro/trump-musk-protest-rally-boston-common-pride-in-democracy/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), including severe¬†[federal funding cuts](http://bostonglobe.com/2025/04/27/nation/trump-threatens-nonprofits/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link),¬†[economic turbulence](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/09/business/small-businesses-tariffs-stock-market-new-england/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)¬†due to new trade policies, and¬†[rollbacks to environmental](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/11/science/trump-executive-order-state-climate-laws/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)¬†and LGBTQ protections.  The state Senate this month announced a ‚ÄúResponse 2025‚Ä≥ initiative intended to figure out how to respond to Trump at the state level. So far, they have endorsed a bill seeking to protect those who¬†[obtain procedures such as gender-affirming care and abortions](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/14/metro/massachusetts-senate-trump-abortion-gender-affirming-care-legal-protections/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)¬†in the state and held a hearing on climate policy. But so far, they have not passed any policies pushing back on the Trump administration or filling federal gaps.",bostonglobe,2025-04-29T09:10:26,10

I live in Massachusetts and it's one of the most liberal states in the country. But I've repeatedly written to both Lori Trahan and Elizabeth Warren imploring them to take stronger positions¬†and to advocate that their party get off its ass. And so far I've received nothing but boilerplate response.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T13:06:08,5

People were not made aware of those things in school. I didn't know about the Japanese interment camps until I read a summer reading book going into 9th grade in New York.
