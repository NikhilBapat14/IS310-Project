"A tech geek? How about just a geek in general? Sure tech stuff is already skyrocketing in price (gpu's, 3d printers, etc) but board games are fucked and getting cancelled left and right, ttrpgs are barely holding on by a string and so on..  Hell car guys I know are about to get priced out too.",FlyingRock,2025-04-28T07:11:54,4
"Tech geek? It's threatening my job. Most computer parts are sourced globally. Some parts of the supply chain are US, but most aren't. It's just impractical to have all parts made in ome spot.   Even if we started building all the fabs necessary to source everything domestically, we're decades away frommakingg everything here. Tariffs are just punishment for these markets existing.  Steve did a great video on tariffs in tech, speaking to businesses all across the industry ahout it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1W_mSOS1Qts&t=8135s&pp=ygUMZ2FtZXJzIG5leGlz  We're so unbelievably fucked. Now apply some of these statements in the video to other indistries and you'll realize that we're looking down the barrel of a fuking nuke.",IUseHamsAsShingles,2025-04-28T12:43:56,2
