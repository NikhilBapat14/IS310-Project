"I'll actually take that. I'm very critical of Israel's political actions--my perspective is actually that Netanyahu is intentionally destabilizing the region to pursue personal power and any defense of Netanyahu is actually anti-Israeli. But I don't agree with this comparison at all.  Oversimplification incoming. Russians are a mixed-ethnicity, mixed-culture people who've had a slew of religions over time and have a strong association with their homeland. Their empire periodically grows and shrinks and strongman leaders often leverage that into a jingoistic narrative claiming they're owed all of those more-adjacent regions.  The Jewish people originated more as a monoreligious, mono-ethnicity that was fractured after they were evicted from their preferred land by the Romans. It's not quite their homeland, but functions like that because their time before they moved to this area is almost prehistoric in a way that rides the line between myth and history. The behavior of the Romans to the early people of Jerusalem is painfully near-identical to the behavior of Israelis towards Palestinians, but that's a whole 'nother story. This eviction from the homeland created a people defined by the diaspora, with wide cultural fragmentation after that point, which is why ""Jewish"" both is and isn't an ethnicity. In the \~two thousand years they were gone from that land, it did not remain empty and became a similar new-homeland for countless other peoples who do not know anything from before.  The diaspora + relationship to the land is utterly key to the Jewish identity in ways that it simply cannot be for Russia.  A far better comparison is Native Americans, imo. This also shows how ridiculously unrealistic our approach is. Native Americans have on average what...a claim to American land from 200 years ago? We've only been here 200 years and we're deeply embedded enough that basically nobody is gonna give their land back. Propose it to congress and you'd get laughed out of the room even by liberals.  The collection of tribes we call Palestinians have been in the land about since the Roman eviction, so \~2000 years. Their claim is 10x stronger than ours over Native Americans. And we're just expecting them to give up all the land because the British said so, then accept constant geographic land creep from the other side and becoming second-class citizens on land that's been in their families for 100 generations.

But we're expecting Palestinians, who may have been there 2000 years, to just happily do exactly that. Which is delusional. My point is that it's real easy to just say other people should give up their stuff for someone who deserves it. By doing so, we're holding Palestinians to a much higher standard than we'd consider reasonable for ourselves.  >We got in line and we were offered the Partition by the UN. We accepted our portion as a compromise.  Well that massively brushes over **the entire problem in history**. Because it conveniently leaves out that the Jewish people were offered land by the British that was already promised to other people already living there. Framing this as a ""compromise"" is the entire point of my above comparison. Because that's not a compromise. That's going in and taking stuff other people have right now and saying ""it's a compromise because I only took some"".  Which brings us back to that comparison I made. No American right now would take that compromise if offered. We're very eager to frame it as a reasonable, moral, obvious need when it's someone *else's* stuff they'd be giving up.

"I mean, even leaving aside what's happening in Gaza right now...the events on the West Bank likely make Netanyahu the most prolific terrorist warlord in modern history. The size of the settler invasion is 2-3x that of ISIS at its peak--and ISIS relied heavily on forced conscripts. Though I guess you could frame all the settler children as child soldiers being weaponized by their parents, and that probably evens out. I want to say in 2022, there was an average of 2 instances of settler terrorism per day or something like that.  West Bank behavior is flat-out indefensible to the point that it says a lot about anyone who defends.  As for Gaza, Netanyahu intentionally sponsored Hamas **against** the advice of his military and intelligence advisors. If you care about Jewish lives, you should hate that man's guts for this. He created a pet terrorist gang and aggressively propped them up to suit his political ends. He and his administration have been bragging about this for decades--Times of Israel had a lot of reporting on it. That gang has killed a lot of Israelis and I think all that responsibility goes right up to Netanyahu for his role in this.  That also makes Netanyahu's role in Gaza completely illegitimate. Because I'm sorry, you don't get to put your pet terrorist gang in power to block the emergence of more legitimate political organizations...and then mass-murder the area for being under the thumb of a terrorist gang.

"I belonged to a conservative synagogue in Colorado.

I kept going after that for a while, but I eventually fell out and started going to smaller gatherings instead. I've tried a few other synagogues, but nothing ever clicked.

I’ll add this to my dossier on Qatari bot tactics. Accuse the Jew of hating Israel! Why didn’t I think of that? I’m the one who wants statehood to fail? You studied politics? You guys are getting pretty good!,Felix_L_US,2025-04-28T14:57:10,1

"Qatari bot? Lolwut? I wish my Arabic were that good, but nope. American queer PoC who just usedta live in Jordan while finishing my degree (specific focus on terrorism) and popped across to Jerusalem quite a few time for class trips/studies/vacations.  Netanyahu's actions are directly harming Israel's security. This is what Israeli military & intelligence advisors have been saying since at least 2015, I think I saw earlier articles than that. He's now getting rid of these positions and surrounding himself with Trump-like yes-men. His foreign policy is absolutely disastrous and is harming Israeli interests across the board. This is a pretty universally accepted analysis by pretty much everyone with regional expertise, *including Israeli experts*.  Times of Israel is pretty centrist and its articles on this have been pretty clear, and that's not even getting into stuff like Haaretz which are even harsher. Or are you saying the Israeli media also doesn't count as really Jewish by your own gatekeeping standards?  You are directly advocating for policies & rhetorical stances that are bad for Israel and you're accusing anyone who's trying to save Israel from Netanyahu of anti-Semitism. Do you know how depraved that is?",Sminahin,2025-04-28T15:15:33,3
"> I think that we should try to suppress our enemies  As insane this statement is on its face, it's even worse in the context of the people you've been replying to. Someone disagreeing with you doesn't make them your enemy. They simply have a different perspective. ""I don't like the way Israel is carrying out the strikes in Gaza because it seems like there's a lot of collateral damage and also what's the endgame?"" is not equivalent to ""Israel should be destroyed and all Jews (Israeli or not) should all be forced into an oven!"" no matter how much it seems to be the case to you.   > None of the people in this thread responded to my explanations with any positivity.  Because your explanations are intertwined with insults and wishing that the person you're responding to gets renditioned to an El Salvadorian prison.

Okay so you are advocating for that. Good to know. I think that makes you an outright enemy of everyone who strives for a free and fair society. It’s antithetical to everything this country claims to be. I hope it ends the same way all the previous attempts at fascism have. I see you as no different from them.,hepcandcigs,2025-04-28T14:17:35,5

If the protestors break the law then put them on trial and then punish them accordingly. Disappearing them to a foreign gulag with no due process is not doing that. If you advocate for that then that makes you a fascist. You seem to have accepted that though. It makes me genuinely sad to see.,hepcandcigs,2025-04-28T15:05:26,4

Could you detail the legal process they had that you find adequate? Cause from my vantage point they haven’t had one. You’re just trying to reshape the definitions of what I’m saying so that you don’t have to fall into the “bad” side of them. Too bad.
