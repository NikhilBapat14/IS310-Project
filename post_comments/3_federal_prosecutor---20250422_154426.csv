"> Three federal prosecutors who worked on the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams resigned Tuesday -- while they were on administrative leave -- instead of agreeing to ""preconditions"" on them returning to the office, sending a sharp letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and accusing him of pressuring them to falsely ""express regret and admit some wrongdoing"" in the case.

Imagine trying to tactfully incriminate a group of skilled lawyers. Lol.,37853688544788,2025-04-22T21:30:11,5
"This case is a perfect example of lawyers and the legal system fighting back.   The DOJ tried to engage in a blatant quid pro quo with Adams when they struck an agreement to set aside foreign campaign finance charges if he would do them a favor — the favor of implementing the administration’s immigration policies in NYC. The original DOJ lawyers balked when asked to do this, because it is illegal, and ended up resigning when they pointed out the illegality to their boss.   The Judge in the case ended up dismissing the case against Adam’s with prejudice, because the DOJ fucked things up so badly.   Bar complaints haven’t happened yet to my knowledge, but they may be coming. ",BasicPhysiology,2025-04-22T16:46:28,13
