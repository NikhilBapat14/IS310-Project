"Hogg wants to fundamentally push the Democratic Party to the left. He sees establishment Dems as an enemy, and its easy to see why. The Dems held all three chambers and nothing was set in place to prevent the swing back to Trump, with the exception of pardons for Biden's in-group, so Hogg doesn't see beating the GOP as the only obstacle. ""Blue No Matter Who"" didn't provide meaningful long-term change when it worked in 2020, and clearly failed in 2016 and 2024, so he's rejecting it in the off-cycle. ""Blue No Matter Who"" is something you say at the ballot box, because there isn't really any other meaningful strategy left for Progressives. Sitting at home is clearly disastrous.

"How the heck did you arrive at that conclusion.  The UBC schema proposed by the Democrats is wasteful, invasive, and doesn’t really solve any of the problems people think it does.  Bad people will still get guns the same way they do now; mostly they just buy them normally or get them from friends and family.  Meanwhile the government has to build and maintain a gun registry, which is a mighty effort and quite impossible for several hundred million guns. This data will be mostly useless as 99.99% of people don’t commit crimes with their guns and that dataset can’t predict most of the ones that do given good faith policing reasons. It’s not information the government needs to know about private, free citizens in case of bad faith reasons.  Private citizens lose the private sale, a practical compromise to pass the Brady Bill. Now they have to notify the government and possibly pay a fee to exchange their private property which, 99.99% of the time, was never a problem.",pants_mcgee,2025-05-01T19:12:37,1
"> How the heck did you arrive at that conclusion.  You said UBC would hinder private sales. You see no value in them, and their requirement is a hinderance, so that'd mean it's also a zero value hinderance to licensed dealers too. If you don't think BC's do anything good, then they shouldn't be done at all. But if they do serve a good purpose, then now there's a very good reason for UBC.  You're so against UBC, so it'd be the first option to dislike BC's in general. Or else, why is it useful for licensed dealers to require BC's, but not private sales?  > Meanwhile the government has to build and maintain a gun registry, which is a mighty effort and quite impossible for several hundred million guns.   The gov manages the social security database for every single US citizen since 1935. The gov already manages BC's for licensed dealers. Managing data is not difficult in a world of computers (even old ass ones).  > and that dataset can’t predict most of the ones that do given good faith policing reasons.  But it catches middle-men. The problem with private sales exemptions is that people with passing BC's can buy weapons, then privately sell them to people who would otherwise fail BC's, and for very good reasons. Currently, this is just legal. The middle man just shrugs and is like ""I was just arming my fellow Americans for $$$ hoo rah"", and our populace has to just cope with all the well armed criminals.  UBC's stop that middle-man from being able to easily sell private weapons to dangerous people. It'll still happen (school shooters often pass BCs), but it'll really help reduce gang violence and make us able to hold those middle-men accountable too (when they skip BC's). I understand it adds another step to the process of owning gun, but that doesn't stop good people from owning guns. We have to register to vote, and even maintain its status because adversarial state governments will drop people from the voter rolls for various ""reasons"".  If you worry about the 2A being impeded, you must be devastated about the 15A violations.",Suedocode,2025-05-01T22:38:00,1
"I never said or implied anything of the sort, that’s your faulty logic.  Every database costs money and resources, often quite a lot. Look to Canada’s bloated failure of a firearm registry for how an American version might go, and they didn’t have near the issues America would have.  It won’t catch any middlemen, it can’t. It’s already illegal to buy and sell guns for profit without an FFL or otherwise subvert federal firearm law. Any middleman selling guns intentionally avoiding background checks is simply going to keep doing that. That’s the grey or black market and they don’t care about background checks.",pants_mcgee,2025-05-01T23:28:53,1
