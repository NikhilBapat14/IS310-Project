"The only ones I've seen are the ones who aren't in office anymore.    But when you find one that's in office and fighting for the people, let us know. Because right now they're all extensions of the MAGA cult and refuse to go against their leader.",TonyG_from_NYC,2025-03-21T22:29:11,185
"I think there are some who want to do the right thing, but at the end of the day they all know they've thrown their lot in with MAGA and aren't willing to risk a right-wing primary challenge. It's amazing how many Republican congressmen are willing to stand up to Trump after they've been voted out of office or have announced they aren't running for re-election. That shows they know they're on the wrong side of history, but aren't willing to sacrifice for what's right. That's why I have so much respect for Liz Cheney, she was the rising star of the GoP, but risked it all to do what she thought was right. Even though I disagree with her on most issues, she's got more guts than the entire Republican Congressional caucus combined.",Searching4Buddha,2025-03-21T23:07:24,77

Trump didnt send any American soldiers anywhere, and brought many home. Plus of course, under Trump there was no war in Ukraine.  And non of this is benefiting Elon.

">everyone has internet these days.  FALSE. 42 million Americans lack access to broadband.    https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-broadband-overreporting-by-state  You just posted an opinion article with an analysis from the right wing Heartland Institute to claim that I’m wrong, while telling me to stop “parroting the farthest of left takes.” Hypocrite much?. That’s not worth the paper it’s printed on and the fact is that the vast majority of non partisan analyses of TCJA prove my point and it’s the furthest thing from a “far left take”.   For example, the “study” cited in the far right columnist’s opinion article you linked, only looked at tax years 2017 and 2018. Did the TCJA magically disappear after that? What happens over time with inflation that Heartland wanted to ignore? Oh yeah, the fact that over time with tax brackets rising, most Americans’ tax burdens actually go up, so the modest benefits that TCJA gave the vast majority of Americans, actually disappear, which is why the current distributional analyses of extending the TCJA show tax increases on most Americans outside of the top 1 percent. Couple all that with the SALT cap in the bill and the closure of several tax deductions, and vast majority of middle class Americans end up paying more in taxes.   https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver  Also this “study” hilariously incorporates all tax deductions into their analysis and the fact is, most Americans never take advantage of all their tax deductions.

Now in 2025 actual results are available to us from the CBO itself:  https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61172#_idTextAnchor008  In 2018 the CBO projections came nowhere near revenue reaching a record high rate of 19% of GDP in 2022 and settling in at 18.3% for the next decade when the historical average is 17.3% of GDP.

I work in this field, if there was a serious income tax proposal, I assume I would see it.  Now, I’m not going to claim Trump hasn’t threatened to tariff countries, he has. I will also admit that tariffs work as a sort of regressive tax in that they impact the poor more than the rich (like everything financial). Those tariffs are not just tariffs for the sake of it. Their goal is to get more reasonable trade deals as the U.S. was very generous in its trade agreements post WW2.   The 20%-60% across the board is what I have an issue with. I don’t see this happening. If there was a real plan then that’s fine, but it’s dishonest to use that figure when the people at the CATO institute (one of their citations) know that’s not going to happen.   CATO gets this figure from when Trump was talking about eliminating the income tax and wholly replacing it with tariffs. If this is the position anyone wants to take I’ll put my life savings down that the U.S. doesn’t switch to a tax system 100% based on tariffs and eliminate the income tax.  It’s a straw man at best.

"I wasn’t really talking about voting. I don’t know how every person voted in silicon valley, i have a better idea of how many tech bros of status and VC’s lean and their ideologies as of 2025, mostly because of podcasts and the stuff they are open about. But for one thing, voting for Kamala didn’t necessarily mean much anyway. She didn’t even run on a left-wing platform, aside from abortion, she ran a centrist to center-right campaign anyway trying to get people like Liz and Dick Cheney, or Adam Kinzinger. Lots of conservatives voted for her. Hell, Richard Spencer voted for her. He’s a white nationalist. Or people didn’t vote because they don’t really believe in american democracy, but rather believe in “exit” and network state utopia’s, or those who hedged their bets and voted for or donated to Kamala because the believed in “voice” over exit, and thought kamala would win and was controllable.   But when I was talking about Silicon Valley tech bros being largely right wing I meant right wing ideals against liberalism among tech bros , like widespread anti-wokeness sentiment, and the widespread support and enthusiasm for network states, and anyone who believes in “exit”, which is common amongst tech bros. People big into cryptocurrency and believes strongly in the network state often hold strong libertarian beliefs  . People who believe in “exit” which is pretty common in SV, hold right wing or right libertarian ideals against regulation of businesses and many hold anti-democratic beliefs against the american system of government, wanting to exit and create new nation states within America, or techfascism.   If they like curtis yarvin’s vision, and yarvin is very popular in silicon valley, they are right wing techfascists, supporters of authoritarianism, or monarchists. And Balaji Srinivasin is very influential, wanting to cleanse the “blues” from San Fran and take back the city.

">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ($1.9 trillion debt increase)  It’s hilarious you provided another source that relies on the same misinformation tactic as above.  What other possible reason is there to use an inaccurate 10-year estimate from 2018 when we have the actual results from then to 2024 readily available today?  That is completely absurd as I’ve already shown we have some of the highest revenue in US history under the 2017 TCJA, but they claim that has somehow added $1.9 trillion to the debt.  Pure BS and they are leading with that point.  Then look what the CRF(BS) does for Biden.  Like the IRA is just absurd:  >The Inflation Reduction Act ($252 billion debt reduction)  Pure misinformation to claim a quarter trillion in debt reduction.  The IRA was originally estimated to reduce the deficit by only $90 billion and that was already from the land of unicorns and fairytales.  It is now on track to increase the debt by $0.75 trillion.  >The new outlook also shed some light on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The report estimates energy-related tax provisions will increase deficits by $427.7 billion more than previously projected between 2024 and 2033, offsetting some of the savings from the FRA. While several factors contribute to this change, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule change has the largest effect. **Initially, the CBO scored the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as a deficit-reducing policy, on net reducing the deficit by $90 billion** between 2022 and 2031 plus about $200 billion in increased revenues from increased IRS enforcement. But these new cost estimates make it clear that the IRA will end up increasing the deficit. **Now, based on CBO’s latest estimates, the IRA credits appear to cost approximately $786 billion** over the new budget window (2024-2033)  https://taxfoundation.org/blog/us-deficit-cbo-budget-economic-outlook/  Let’s not pretend for single moment the Biden was a big saver instead of a big spender.  No amount of misinformation with fancy graphics can cover that up.  They infamously proclaimed this was the time to “Spend Big” with their crazy large budget proposals:  >President Biden on Friday unveiled an historically large $6 trillion 2022 budget, making his case to Congress that **now is the time for America to spend big.** > >Mr. Biden's proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 surpasses former President Trump's proposed budget last year of $4.8 trillion, and comes after trillions the U.S. has already spent to battle the dual health and economic crises brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  > >Budget projections show a $6 trillion price tag is **just the beginning**, with spending steadily increasing each year until the budget reaches $8.2 trillion in 2031.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-budget-6-trillion-proposal-2022/",Fargason,2025-03-22T18:59:06,0

"> I didn't respond with any bullshit.  The following is what I was talking about:  > you need to break free from the strangle hold it appears the reddit bubble has on you.  As for the laptop and lab leak theory, here's my take: the left never really cared about either.  I don't remember seeing any press coverage calling Hunter Biden's laptop Russian disinformation (but I paid very little attention to the laptop story), so I went looking on r/politcs.  I found the Daily Wire and Breitbart with articles about it not being part of a Russian disinformation campaign, and something from the Daily Beast quoting Ratcliff saying Adam Schiff should be ""put away"" for calling the story Russian disinfo, but nothing claiming it was Russian disinfo.  Do you have any sources, or is it possible the right was doing reaction pieces to the claim without the claim itself actually being elevated on the left?  The lab leak theory I did pay more attention to, but my take at the time was that it was a dumb debate. The more important question was how to stop the spread, not whose fault it was. Whether it came from a lab or a market was irrelevant to what I cared about, which keeping my family safe.  As for the media on the left, they covered the debate, but I don't remember them taking sides. They printed whatever the theory of the day or argument of the day was.  > sorry if you took it as an offense. thanks for the compliment. you seem like a good person and you heard me out, that's fantastic stuff !

"You do realize that I was never talking about the TCJA’s effects on the debt and deficit right? From the beginning when I was responding to the other poster, I was talking about its distributional effects. I have no idea why you even brought up the deficit issue. Seems like you want to argue that because you know its benefits go largely to the richest but whatever, I’ll bite. If you don’t like my original source, then you can also dislike the Joint Committee on Taxation too. And you just claim out of thin air that we have the highest revenue in history under TCJA which is a complete fabrication on your part. Are you saying we have higher revenue now than when marginal tax rates were in the 90 percentile back in the 60’s? That’s a laughable claim.   >The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office have published several estimates of TCJA’s expected budget impact. These estimates all show TCJA substantially **reducing** revenues and increasing deficits over its first decade. The specific amount varies—from about $1 trillion to $2 trillion—for three reasons.  https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tcja-affect-federal-budget-outlook  Now here’s a look back which you called for and shows that TCJA’s revenue collection was actually less than CBO projected and we only had an increase in revenue collection because of the post pandemic inflation, NOT TCJA.   >Roughly two-thirds of the higher-than-projected revenue – about $1 trillion out of $1.5 trillion – can be explained by higher nominal revenue **due to inflation** rather than increases in real (inflation-adjusted) revenue.  >More than the entirety ($576 billion out of $478 billion) of the higher-than-projected real revenue collection came from a one-time, temporary revenue surge in 2022 alone, five years after the TCJA began.   >The 2022 revenue surge is unlikely to be related much if at all to the TCJA and was instead likely caused by the temporary effects of spiking inflation – before the tax code adjusted, a windfall of capital gains realizations, and general recovery from the pandemic recession.  >**Outside of 2022, current and projected revenue came in about $100 billion under CBO’s 2018 projections on a real (inflation-adjusted) basis – a modest 0.5 percent below projections.**  >https://www.crfb.org/blogs/has-tcja-paid-itself  In other words, the TCJA’s revenue projections actually came in LOWER than CBO expected.  And when did I say Biden was some big saver? The CFRB analysis clearly shows that Biden ran a deficit and debt, it just also showed that Trump and Republicans increased it WAY more which is inconvenient for your argument.  But again, I was never talking  about the deficit or the debt. You inserted that into the discussion when you butted into my conversation with someone else. I was talking about the benefits going to the rich and before that cuts to social Security, medicare, and Medicaid.",Ozymandias12,2025-03-23T08:56:58,2
"Ok, so a thing you should know about me is that I am a biologist, so when conservative politicians produce these lists of “wasteful” projects funded by government agencies, I actually understand how they are making these studies sound much sillier than they actually are.   For example, the infamous “[shrimp on a treadmill” study](https://www.npr.org/2011/08/23/139852035/shrimp-on-a-treadmill-the-politics-of-silly-studies) that was portrayed as a test of how fast they could run, was actually measuring the metabolism of shrimps under stress and in different water conditions, which is critically important information for the seafood economy and assessing habitat degradation.   Rand Paul, in particular, uses this tactic all the time. He presents the full price tag of the grant, then pulls out one tiny sliver of the methods that sound goofy to someone who doesn’t understand them and pretends that is what the subject of the study was.   So yeah, if you want me to believe these claims, you’re going to need to cite some sources.",Polyodontus,2025-03-23T17:15:06,1

Yeah the grants goes to one NGO, then that NGO divvies it out, making which obfuscates what the government is actually funding, and there's no Spending bill that names, in example ""rewiring America""    which is an other reason I'm happy DOGE is doing al these deep dives.    Not to say I'll agree with 100% of what they cut.  I think a mine cleanup organization working in Laos also lost their founding.   I definitely support that.  whether Trump or other conservatives do, doesn't matter,  I support cleaning up mines and bombs the US dropped.",discourse_friendly,2025-03-23T13:27:48,1
"Just calling out blatant misinformation and especially when some claims the CBPP as a nonpartisan source.  They are so partisan they will gladly misrepresent the facts to push their agenda.  Then you claim The Hill is “the farthest right” when it is actually quite nonpartisan:  https://www.allsides.com/news-source/hill-media-bias  A yes, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office did publish several estimates of TCJA’s budget impact… in 2017 and 2018.  That is 3 times now you have relied on old estimates from before the TCJA took effect instead of the actual results of the law from the last 7 years under it.  Ever wonder why Democrats never touched this law despite having full power to do so in 2021 & 2022?  Despite all the rhetoric they didn’t want to mess with a good thing, so their actions speak volumes here.  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S  There is the revenue per GPD for the last century and in the 1960s it averaged around 17% despite a 90% percentile bracket that was mainly just for show. Clearly settling in at 18.3% revenue for the next decade would be a significant improvement.  Plus, the whole reason this data is presented as a percentage of GDP is to account for inflation over the years. There goes that point by CRFB, but why are you continually trusting them despite pointing out several of their lies now?  They clearly have no integrity and will claim just about anything to push their agenda.  All claims by them are suspect.

"Ok, [so this is](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/02/20/sesame-street-usaid-iraq/) why I was asking for links to information. It wasn’t a grant to fund a Sesame Street tv show at all.   “The archived USAID webpage said the agency would provide $20 million in funding to Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind ""Sesame Street,"" between July 2021 and June 2027 to produce Ahlan Simsim Iraq, the early childhood development program.  A Sesame Workshop spokesperson said via email that the ""Ahlan Simsim"" TV show is funded separately from the Ahlan Simsim Iraq early childhood development program. They added that only the latter received USAID money.  However, usaspending.gov, an open data source of federal spending information, only lists $18.2 million in obligated funding for Sesame Workshop during this period — one $13 million grant starting in July 2021 and one $5.2 million grant starting in September 2021. According to usaspending.gov, only $473,784 of the two grants had been ""outlayed,"" or paid out to the Sesame Workshop, at the time of this writing, meaning the rest of the funding was yet to be paid.”  … “Despite the funding discrepancy, one thing remains clear: According to Sesame Workshop, the recipient of USAID's grant, USAID money only funded the Ahlan Simsim Iraq early childhood development program. This program did include localized content which leveraged the existing ""Ahlan Simsim"" TV show. However, the two initiatives, though bearing a similar name, are funded separately.   A Sesame Workshop spokesperson said that the ""Ahlan Simsim"" TV show was funded ""through separate philanthropic funding,"" not USAID grants to Ahlan Simsim Iraq. The spokesperson further explained:  The USAID-funded ""Ahlan Simsim Iraq"" program supports the creation of local content and materials, which include localized media content to reach children at scale and teaching and learning materials like storybooks, activity books, classroom materials, and training and facilitators guides for teachers for use in early childhood development centers to improve children's learning by training teachers, parents, caregivers, and youth leaders.”",Polyodontus,2025-03-23T22:24:17,1
