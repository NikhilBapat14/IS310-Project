"Look around, take stock of where you are, and know this: Today, right now—and I mean right this second—you have the most power you’ll ever have in the current fight against authoritarianism in America. If this sounds dramatic to you, it should. Over the past five months, in many hours of many conversations with multiple people who have lived under dictators and autocrats, one message came through loud and clear: America, you are running out of time.",PapyrusKami74,2025-04-22T05:19:32,75
This isn’t alarmism. It’s a warning from people who’ve seen democracy die in real time. The biggest mistake we can make is thinking ‘it can’t happen here.’,fulltrendypro,2025-04-22T05:25:48,52

"I'll just say this.   Any meaningful resistance will not be organized on corporate social media sites. For those are beholden, by law, to turn over records of any such thing to the authorities.   Any online organizing will be done on private forums hosted by individuals with their own servers.   And will not be accessible by DNS lookup.",Joadzilla,2025-04-22T08:10:59,9
"There should be some way that citizens can have the authors of Project 2025, the “how to” map for Trump, prosecuted for overthrowing a democracy.  Trump was NOT voted in.  He even told us how knowledgeable Musk is about voting machines, which leaves me with the impression that Musk and his DOGE kids had a lot to do with the outcome of the last election.   They (Project authors, Heritage Foundation, oligarchs including Musk) know that the majority of the voters would not reelect Trump, so they fixed it for Trump.  They are all traitors to the Constitution.  There must be a way.",BoomBoomBoomer4591,2025-04-22T09:51:42,7

"The chorus of people who have lived through democratic ruin will all tell you the same thing: *Do not make the mistake of assuming you still have time*. Put another way: *You think you can wait and see, and keep democracy intact? Wanna bet?* Those who have seen democracy wrecked in their home country are sometimes derided as overly pessimistic—and it’s understandable that they’d have a sense of inevitability about the dangers of autocracy. But that gloomy worldview does not make their warnings any less credible: Unless Trump’s power is checked, and soon, things will get much worse very quickly. When people lose their freedoms, it can take a generation or more to claw them back—and that’s if you’re lucky.",PapyrusKami74,2025-04-22T05:19:54,45

"I would have more hope if Americans were actually doing anything.  Yelling at Town Halls where politicians don’t care is nice, but won’t change anything.  Protests so far and boycotts have been noted in the news, but remain pretty small.  They also aren’t lasting long enough to damage many politicians/people who can actually force the change away from fascism.    Certainly not large enough nor coordinated enough to force change.  Americans so far have been happy to sit back and whine.  We’ve yet to see any real fight.  That is concerning.  I hope that it changes, I really do, but I have lost my faith in Americans to actually coordinate with each other and take actions that can actually change things.  The thing about having time to fight is that it’s only useful if you use it to fight.  So far, that hasn’t really happened.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-22T07:17:33,2

"We have to get at least one more political party. It is the two party system that is fucked up.   The best way to do that is to transition to a parliamentary democracy like the UK, Germany, etc.  Ranked choice voting with our current system might be enough to accomplish it too. But a parliamentary system would be vastly better.",TheMightyTywin,2025-04-22T14:00:54,3
