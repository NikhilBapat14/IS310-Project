"Since you have closed primaries, yes. You should always register as the party whose primary you want to vote in, unless you live in an open primary state. There's no rule, legally or informally, that says you have to vote for your affiliated party in the general election.   I always say ""I'm X at heart, but Y on paper"", because I'm signed up for the majority party in my state even though I have opposite beliefs. This is because the same party always gets elected, so the primary is more important than the general election here.  In some states the number of registered voters for a third party affect their presence on the ballot... but they don't have much of a chance unless you have ranked choice voting, anyway.",Corricon,2022-08-13T18:08:41,19
"Oregon has closed primaries, so being registered Green does affect your ability to vote in primaries.  It doesn't affect anything else, though.",UmberGryphon,2022-08-13T17:44:09,10
"Read up on [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). Basically given how we elect people (first past the post, single representative districts) you are going to have 2 parties that matter and small parties that affect nothing. If the Greens  every have a position that represents a significant portion of the electorate one of the other parties will adopt that position.  The only voting Green can do is help the party *furthest* from your views. Registering Democrat gives you some influence on which Democrat runs.",matts2,2022-08-14T00:17:26,3
"Fellow Oregonian here, also green-inclined.  1. After Stein's antics in 2016, I'm no longer registered green. I'm no less progressive than before, but the GP itself has lost my confidence.  2. Tactically, you should register Democrat here. The state is on the whole ultramarine blue (despite the blood red rural areas). So this way you can help to support the more progressive democratic candidate and help pull Oregon Dems further left, especially while the Oregon Republicans keep going further and further into crazy MAGA territory.  3. In the meantime, I'd donate time or money if you have either to direct causes you support. ACLU, NRDC, PP, SPLC, etc- there are lots of orgs doing good work out there, even if there isn't a dedicated political party for them.",[deleted],2022-08-14T14:44:31,3
"3rd parties in America are pointless. Unless our system has some radical changes few if any Green Party people will ever be elected. Best bet is try to make changes from within the 2 parties. Trump radically changed the GOP, we can do the same for the DNC.",MrStuff1Consultant,2022-08-14T16:05:40,2
"You should register with who you feel comfortable registering with. Honestly it comes down to the mailings and spam contacts you receive. People use the registered voters DB's to target advertising and fundraising.   I remain independent because it is very simple to look up someone's political affiliation in my state and no one needs to know that... especially these days... although that means I get bombarded by both parties...I also feel as if I can't vote in primaries , because that can be looked up...but maybe that's just me being overly cautious...",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-13T17:51:09,1
Do you plan to be involved in politics in any other way besides voting?  It only affects the primaries if you do not plan any other engagement besides voting.,Naliamegod,2022-08-13T22:18:10,1

"Yes, it absolutely makes a difference. It makes it so your voice isn't heard and you are not considered part of the bargaining table. Because the US uses a single-member district plurality voting system (also called ""First Past the Post by people whose political education consists solely of YouTube Videos), voting coalitions are formed prior to elections rather than afterward like other liberal democracies. Third parties in places like the US are voluntarily abstaining from the democratic process in the vain hope that one day their party will be the big one.",Volsunga,2022-08-14T15:02:21,1
"We need radical change in the US and plurality voting is one of the major institutions that needs to go. Having another type of voting system would give candidates from other parties a shot to start sharing power instead of being thought of as a spoiler or unattainable alternative. In fact, one of my favorite voting alternatives, (STAR Voting), hails from your home state of Oregon. Check out r/EndFPTP to learn about this one and others then support the ones you think make the most sense. Bottom line, there are no 'perfect' voting alternatives, but most of them would be an improvement over our current one. I hope this is helpful!",desertdweller365,2022-08-14T18:31:55,1
"It should be noted that you very much can help elect the Dems who are nominated by their party. Sanders has never earned a broader national nomination, so no one can help get him elected beyond his current position.  But if you're talking about the primary, then yes, if you want to help the Dems govern who they think should be the future of their party, then you would need to be at least nominally committed to the Dems. That's just how it is.  For what it's worth, the Green party isn't really a functional political party. They don't run local or congressional candidates and do not make any effort to build up a grassroots coalition of voters that can actually win races. Even if we just completely ignored how elections work and assumed Jill Stein *somehow* could win the presidency, she'd still accomplish zero percent of her platform because she would have no organized political structure in Congress or anywhere else to enact that platform.  Really, if you want to have any usefulness on the American political system at all, you should register with an actual political party like the Dems or Reps. These parties are big and popular for a reason. They are actual functional political parties that both have the agency to make and keep promises and also allow their voters to have meaningful participation in our political system.  But remember, at the end of the day, having only very limited ability for any individual to influence the outcomes is the express point. The whole reason we like representative democracy is *because* you can't simply choose to spend more money or put in more effort to guarantee your preferred outcomes. The results of our system are determined by the actions of the collective, and our votes only have meaning when they are part of a multitude. That is a feature, not a bug.",mormagils,2022-08-15T09:51:33,1

"Local primaries often determine the outcome of the general election, especially with the majority of US residents living in non-competitive districts. OP's vote doesn't really matter for the presidential primary, but their participation in local races might actually have an impact.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-08-14T12:13:09,1
"On the downside, being registered as an independent almost assuredly guarantees you get more sampling from polling firms.",scubafork,2022-08-13T19:28:27,4
"And boy do I get polled a TON. Lol... I agree - my voice is heard way more than others for that reason and I'm ok with that. This election cycle has been fun because they try to ask which way you ""lean"" and either stop the poll or keep asking questions. It becomes obvious that they are trying to get a sample that fits whomever they are polling for. Kinda scary if you think about it...",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-13T19:37:54,1
"> This election cycle has been fun because they try to ask which way you ""lean"" and either stop the poll or keep asking questions. It becomes obvious that they are trying to get a sample that fits whomever they are polling for.   More likely they've already captured a statistically representational number of X-leaning independents and are trying to round out their poll with Y-leaning independents, as opposed to it being a skewed poll.  In order for polls to be representative they need to sample/weight poll participants accurately. If they're calling in a deep blue state, for example, they may have already talked to enough left-leaning independents and are hunting for some conservative-leaning independents to get an accurate people of what they think -- because they presumably know what you think by having already talked to all your neighbors.",Impune,2022-08-13T20:09:34,3
You are right... Sometimes they will just say they have enough of people in that category before they end the poll. Others will ask one question and if they don't get what they want they just hangup. You can tell the cheap ones based on the wording of the questions.,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-13T20:17:48,0
