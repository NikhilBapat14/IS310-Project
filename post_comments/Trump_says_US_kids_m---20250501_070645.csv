I think the concern is about the massive number of small businesses that rely on this supply chain. We will have yet another wave of small business death.,LemartesIX,2025-05-01T12:02:31,153
"Well, he certainly could have phrased it better. My worry is that since China doesn't vote and their leaders care much less about public opinion they can withstand longer than us even if their economy gets worse.   I also worry that apart from possible lower discretionary spending, which we could all do with less, it will be the mandatory necessities that will be most affected if this continues much longer.   I'm worried that the covid supply chain mess may be relatively mild in comparison.   I hope to be wrong about everything.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-01T09:57:56,117

"Completely agree with the point, American consumerism has gotten out of control and it has resulted in so much waste and many people becoming slaves to credit card companies because of it.

"Too much cheap consumerism as people rack up credit card debt. It's hard to get off a sugar binge but I definitely agree with the sentiment of changing how the economy is optimized. The current optimization only benefits child factories in China to churn out cheapest products possible so Sue can order 5 cheap plastic accessories and max out her credit card.    I'd say actually europe has less of this problem, there's more domestic manufacturing, less consumerism, and interestingly vastly fewer credit card users spending money they don't have - that is key.",whiteKreuz,2025-05-01T08:55:16,27
"I agree with this, Americans are fatties, if not physically than spiritually. If they aren't stuffing their faces to quell their anxieties they are stuffing their homes and our landfills.  That said this needs to be about more than just sticking it to the Chinese. We need serious focus on the things that people can't do without because that's what the real cause of the insecurity and anxiety is about. People need to feel secure if you want them to have kids and that means making housing affordable and safe. We need to go further though and recognize that the purpose of housing is security and in current conditions (endless migrants, forced ""equality"" aka no freedom of association) these two things are at odds.  Decreasing the cost of housing also decreases the security that it provides by allowing gangs and other low functioning groups into your neighborhoods and school districts. It's a pretty difficult situation, but something more needs to be done than paying 5k to low-lifes that will pop out a dozen babies they will neglect just to rip off the system.",fleshdropcolorjeans,2025-05-01T12:40:01,11

"Supply chains take years to reconstruct.  It's way beyond ""cheap junk"".  Decades ago Japan was accused of making ""cheap junk"", now their manufacturing prowess is the envy of the world.  China has come up the learning curve and in many cases matches the Japanese at a lower cost. BYD, their electric car maker, makes products that meet or exceed Tesla's products at a lower cost.  The business of America is business.  Our standard of living is predicted on sophisticated supply chains for American businesses.  Trump and his administration needs to get strategic by tariffing only those products that protect and preserve our national security and economic drivers of growth.  Tariffing low-value-add products just unnecessarily taxes the American people with no benefit to the country.  Bringing discretionary consumer goods factories will not result in our children or grandchildren having better lives.  ""Tough love"" will have unintended consequences that only those of us that actually make things in America viscerally understand since we face it every day.  Most large manufacturers make where they sell.  If tariffs stick, that will only drive American companies to expand in countries that have low tariffs.    Tariffs caused my company to institute a hiring freeze, pause U.S. expansion, and start considering opening factories in countries where we sell.  50% of our revenue comes from foreign buyers, if that dries up due to sticky retaliatory tariffs, we will have layoffs and our expansion plans will be in regions that buy a lot of our products.  That situation is similar to what is happening across thousands of manufacturing companies across American right now.  The jobs that will be created by foreign companies that set up factories here will be offset by all the layoffs at American companies that will set up factories in other countries to service those customers.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-01T11:56:54,240

"This is the answer - we are *addicted* to cheap goods.  Let's use a refrigerator, for example. Will costs go up if they are made in America? Yes, absolutely. But you will be able to afford one.  In a time before cheap Chinese goods, Americans spent big bucks on mega popular philco (and others) refrigerators. For example, a cheaper Philco went for about $500. In 1950 dollars, that was roughly $6,500.   Compare that to today's market [where midline, new refrigerators can be had for $1,000 - $1,300 dollars.  ](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-Side-by-Side-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3q0)  Today's machine is probably 3x the size, 5x more powerful, has more bells and whistles, and costs nearly 1/6th the cost of 1950s refrigerators.   Cheap labor is the driving force behind that. Can you afford the $6,500 refrigerator today? Yeah - you probably could, especially if you bought it on credit or used lay-away. But the question is: would you buy it? That answer is no because of our crippling cheap goods addiction.   In order for America to become self-reliant, and self sufficient, we need to decouple from China. It is a belt tightening moment, but will lead to much greater prosperity for us at home.",_TheConsumer_,2025-05-01T11:48:01,-53
