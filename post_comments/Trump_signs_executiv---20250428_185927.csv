"Even if everyone were getting due process, cities still shouldn't cooperate.   Cities have an incredibly limited budget. Their funds should be spent focusing on city issues; not doing the job of the federal government for them.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-28T19:13:55,14
"It'll be interesting to see what happens if federal funds are cut off. Probably head to courts, which the administration seems to be ignoring at any opportunity.",jaded-navy-nuke,2025-04-28T19:13:56,4

"Basically sanctuary cities just mean that they are not cooperating with ICE, they didn't stop the ICE.   And the biggest reason is because ICE comes in and don't care about anything.  They will arrest people in hospital, charge the school and church, and just raid the neighborhood.   It actually caused great tension between local police and the immigrant neighborhood, and it drives up the crime rate.   You see, ICE just cares about quota, but the police officers have to be patrolling the neighborhood daily. If the neighborhood stop cooperating with the cops, the ICE would still be fine but the local cops would be having a hard time.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-28T19:33:28,8
"Being a sanctuary city basically means that the cities are going to use their incredibly limited budget to deal with city issues. Immigration enforcement is under the purview of the federal government, and these cities are telling the feds that they're not going to use what little money they have to do the job of the feds.   In office politics terms it's the busy workers telling the lazy project manager to get off their ass and do their job.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-28T19:45:46,3
"Do we go around demanding more cops on the streets making arrests and traffic stops so speeding laws get enforced? These are laws that are on the books, so they should be enforced and followed by Americans, yet there are still millions of people speeding, breaking the law, and not getting punished. People speeding illegally really do endanger lives and cause injury and property damage and get people killed. Do you want your tax dollars going to more cops to enforce speeding laws?   Setting aside if we define entering this country in an undocumented way as an illegal act in itself, America is devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to border patrol, numerous agencies and agents, immigration courts and judges, processing and fingerprinting and booking every migrant we come across, all to enforce illegal immigration. Is it really *worth* that tradeoff?",pierre_x10,2025-04-28T19:48:39,3
"It’s where I separate from Democrats. Giving them due process is important, and what Trump is doing is shitty, but the extreme left wingers want them to have prepaid debit cards and be put up in hotels indefinitely.

"People always skirt over that part. Sanctuary cities are not guarding immigrants. They just refuse to use their limited resources for immigration enforcement. The feds would leave them in the cities for months or years without ever covering the bills. That is what sanctuary cities were about, not footing the bill for a federal agency who would take advantage of them.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-28T19:25:32,10

"There is also the question of where Federal funds come from. What might happen if a state or multiple states took the same approach? I mean, what's good for the gander is good for the goose right? Trump can threaten whomever he wants, but where do those funds he's threatening to withhold come from?",StormFireX001,2025-04-28T19:22:13,6

"To whomever down voted me, do you think all those funds come from federal income tax? You do realize there are both state and federal income taxes, among others. How do you think the federal government gets that money? States collect that money. When the federal government redistributes money, they are redistributing money that came from the states. So yes, that is a stance the States could take. Please do explain",StormFireX001,2025-04-28T20:11:08,4
