"It's deeply concerning how rapidly President Trump's approval rating has plummeted, particularly seeing the statistic showing a nearly 24-point difference compared to Biden's rating at this stage, it's a real indicator of something really wrong, and while Spain and similar countries might benefit from these shifts, it feels like a tragically short-term gain, especially because the broader instability created in the end harms vulnerable populations and creates lasting negative consequences, to be honest, it's just not worth it.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T08:45:15,18

I think it may take longer to repair our image on the world stage. Even if we improve with two back to back competent presidents how can other nations trust we don’t vote in another imbecile to tear it all back down ?,Vismal1,2025-04-28T10:08:03,8

"It’s your framework that allows all of this. Until you deal with the root causes, nobody outside the US trusts that you won’t be flipflopping on policies every four years. Not just flipflopping, but doing it to the *extreme*.   You need to deal with the free speech that got you into this. Lies lies lies lies lies. There should be some accountability, but there is none. “But we don’t want to get rid of free speech”. Fine, don’t. The only bits that need tightened are the bad bits, and the only ones defending those bits are politicians and far-right media.   Plenty of countries around the world have a good level of freedom of speech that protects them against the rise of shite like you have to deal with, but are still happy with their freedom. Americans are trained that their freedom is under threat all the time, but it is not. It is just the political speech bit that has politicians worried, so they rile the masses with bullshit after bullshit.",Monkfich,2025-04-29T06:20:49,1
