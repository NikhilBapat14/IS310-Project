"Students have been able to opt out of the Pledge of Allegiance because it 'offends' some based on religious beliefs or whatever, so exposing kids to LGBT propaganda should be optional too on the same grounds.   Public school students are failing across the country and it's only getting worse. Until the education system can get the remedial issues right there should be no consideration of the social engineering crap. For any student.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-22T07:17:14,126
"Once again, the simple fact that this is even a question worthy of a scotus decision demonstrates the utter failure of republicans prior to the advent of maga to stand up for even common sense, let alone conservative principles.  It should never have even gotten to this point, and the old right is just as complicit for the state of this nation as the left is.",Shadeylark,2025-04-22T08:08:36,110
"It's an odd feeling seeing the general gatekeeping of public education by educators after growing up when schools were *absolutely desperate* for parents to be more involved.  And having grown up in that environment, the idea that parents may not be ""allowed"" input into their child's public school education would be a nail in the coffin in my mind.  And I mean this not in reaction to the specifics of ""there's too much sex in this book for my sixth grade kid,"" but for ALL of the reasons why parents seek a little bit of variance for their kids.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-22T09:43:19,20

">The controversy began in November 2022 when Montgomery County Public Schools introduced new LGBTQ books into the curriculum as part of the district's ""inclusivity"" initiative.  To be clear. This is a DEI initiative meant to bully young children into submission to progressive ideology.  Excellent schools know how to teach children to respect others without brainwashing them. Montgomery County does not appear to be one of those school systems.  EDIT: The next time someone asks you what's wrong with DEI, remind them of what is happening in this school system. In the name of ""inclusivity,"" students are being forced to consume controversial content. And we have every reason to believe students who question the ""truth"" and/or wisdom of this content will be silenced under the guise of ""hate speech."" After all, there is a history of both teachers and students being reprimanded for not toeing-the-line.",Farmwife64,2025-04-22T07:34:49,44

Is this not already a thing? I remember being opted out of reading a biography about Oprah in 3rd grade because it talked about her rape.,mexils,2025-04-22T20:30:21,2
"If you are teaching things to children that you don't want the parents to know about, you are probably teaching them things that in a sane society would get you... well, if I say it, I'll get banned.  There's a reason my kids aren't in public schools.",Fact_Stater,2025-04-22T16:45:08,2

It's clearly not a federal issue. It's OBVIOUSLY a state issue that needs to be decided by each state.,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-22T08:52:11,26

"They know in reality there is no way there would ever be a demand from the children for something like this. So, like all good indoctrination and social contagions, its pushed from the top down and the adults in the room are fired for speaking up about it.",OliverMonster1,2025-04-22T08:09:47,28

"Depending on when you went to school that was your choice. When I was in school in the 70s everybody stood up and recited the Pledge.

"No matter which level is expected to solve this problem, it's actually a really hard problem to solve in a black and white way that's ironclad and easily put to paper, and that's the tricky bit. Like, we don't want parents opting kids out of being expected to learn math for obvious reasons. But we do want them to be able to opt out of certain literature and material that is inconsistent with their values.  It's an easy thing for any person who is being reasonable to sus out just based on ""gut feel"". But the sorts of teachers who push this stuff are not just going to always act reasonably, and any law that relies on gut feel is easy for bad actors to skate around. I absolutely agree that parents should be able to opt their kids out of this sort of material - my parents did (and when the school tried to push back, I just happened to come down with ""a cold"" on the day of the assignment). But what I don't know is how to put that to paper in a law that doesn't also allow parents to opt their kids out of learning algebra, or chemistry, or the like. Maybe that's a problem that clever lawmakers can solve - but I know that I am not that clever myself.",homestar92,2025-04-22T15:22:36,5
States are responsible for setting curriculum. Telling kids which books to read is the most essential part of curriculum there is.,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-24T06:46:12,2
Not sure how you figure that. They literally banned the controversial books in states run by Republicans. Maryland is run by Democrats.,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-22T09:13:55,7
"Just to give extremely important and omitted context to our dear readers, the pledge predated the Nazis by 30 years and the physical gesture was *not* the same as the Nazi salute. The salute was changed to the hand over the heart we all know today because it was visibly similar.

Yeah I can agree with all of that. This is where I err on the side of not making a specific rule either. There's so much nuance when it comes to how we teach kids that I don't think anyone will can encompass all the potential obstacles or conflicts that parents and teachers might encounter along the way.,bjbc,2025-04-22T18:45:41,2
The state is not their guardian. The parents are. They should be able to opt out of any book they choose. There is a reason we were given permission slips for books and movies that could be considered controversial. My mom had to give permission for me to be able to read The Scarlett letter. When my daughter took a film studies class they gave us a list at the beginning of the semester of all the films so we could opt out of any of them if we wanted to.,bjbc,2025-04-24T11:34:07,1
"If they'd been successful it wouldn't be a question for scotus.  So what if Maryland is run by Democrats?  Pointing to the other guy and saying ""he beat us!"" Is not a sign of success.

"No. No one is saying not to educate your kids. You're making stuff up to fit some imaginary scenario that is not part of this conversation.

">No one is saying not to educate your kids.  That's not my question. Do parents have the unfettered right to NOT educate their own children, even if it's an admittedly dumb idea?
