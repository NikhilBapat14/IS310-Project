"What I want to know, because it is usually like this, is if that is 163B less than last year OR just 163B less than they planned on increasing spending?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T10:28:34,171
"Is it 163B for the year or over 10yrs like every pash budget is, so it would only be 16B savings a year.",pdawg43,2025-05-02T10:31:26,62
> The White House Office Management and Budget in a statement said the proposed budget would raise defense spending by 13% and homeland security spending by nearly 65% compared to 2025 enacted levels. Non-defense discretionary spending would be cut by 23% to the lowest level since 2017.,zroxx2,2025-05-02T10:09:44,38

"First, 163B less than when? Now? 2024? 2020? If it isn‚Äôt pretty far back there, this is barely a drop in the bucket at this point. We need some pretty drastic cuts ASAP.",deadzip10,2025-05-02T16:40:12,5

The current reality is if we want to fix the border crisis we need to pump a ton of money into DHS and defense.   DHS has been gutted over the years. The biggest issue they're having right now on the border is not enough resources for all the deportation efforts that Trump's trying to do.   I'd bet a decent chunk of that increased military spending is going towards putting more soldiers on the border,Opening-Citron2733,2025-05-02T11:36:41,-27
