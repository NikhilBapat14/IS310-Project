"Neo-Nazi racist xenophobe Stephen Miller founded the group which filed the lawsuit, America First Legal (AFL). How convenient, the acronym also works for American Fascist League! Sieg Heil!  Example, as high school student he wrote an op-ed remarking about the scarcity of Latinos in his honors classes, cut off relationship with a Latino friend because of his heritage, and in Trump 1.0 repeatedly tried to implement a prohibition of children of undocumented immigrants from attending public schools (despite a Supreme Court decision explicitly allowing this).
