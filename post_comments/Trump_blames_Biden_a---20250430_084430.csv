The economy was in a good state when Biden left. 2.4% inflation 4.1% unemployment, those are objectively decent numbers, and the stock market was doing well on top of things.

Part 1   https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jqoyoq/americans_how_do_you_feel_about_the_fact_that_the/mla0gje/   Part 2   https://old.reddit.com/r/AskUS/comments/1jvitjr/why_are_democrats_better_for_our_economy/mmegmfb/     The vote is called amidst the desolate camp. Chad, pointing dramatically towards the distant, impassable mountains, speaks of ""Positive Energy Activation"" and a hidden ""Hyperloop Tunnel."" The Ramblers, starved for hope as much as for food, look at the skeletal remains of the bus, then at Chad's unwavering confidence. Desperation wins. Chad is back in charge.  ""Travel light! Shed the burdens of the past!"" Chad declares, initiating the Great Hyperloop Expedition. He leads his followers away from the relative (if squalid) safety of the bus, urging them to leave behind tools, water filters, and Brenda's painstakingly crafted maps. They march towards the mountains, fueled by Chad's gut feelings and ""positive vibes."" The trek is brutal. The terrain, unforgiving. Snacks run out almost immediately. Dehydration sets in. Predictably, no tunnel appears. Chad blames the ""negative energy"" of the Lizards who‚Äôd secretly packed extra water purification tablets instead of just ""believing harder."" After narrowly escaping a rockslide that leaves several Rangers reconsidering their allegiance, the expedition grinds to a halt. Starving, thirsty, and utterly disillusioned, the group realizes the folly of abandoning their only shelter. In a mutinous whisper campaign, they vote Brenda back in charge, even though she remained miles away with the few who refused Chad's Folly.  The trek back is a grim, humiliating affair. Brenda, ever the pragmatist, meets the returning prodigals not with blame, but with organization. The camp around the bus wreckage is re-established, but resources are scarcer than ever. Nearby foraging spots are depleted. Shelter repair is hampered by the materials Chad's group discarded or lost. Brenda institutes a painstaking salvage operation on the dead engine, hoping to find something usable, but progress is measured in scraped knuckles and frustration. Life becomes a monotonous cycle of patching leaks, scavenging for edible roots, and guarding the dwindling water supply. Hope is a forgotten luxury.  Chad, however, bounces back with alarming speed. He avoids blame for the disastrous hike, instead framing it as a ""successful elimination of a wrong path."" He starts talking about ""untapped potential,"" gesturing towards a dry, cracked patch of ground. ""Rafts! We build rafts! The river will come!"" He promises less work, more rousing speeches, a ""bold new direction."" The Ramblers, exhausted by the sheer hard labor of survival under Brenda's grim realism, find their memories of the near-fatal hike fading. Chad's nonsensical promises sound, if not believable, at least less demanding than Brenda's constant calls for vigilance and work. Against all odds, they vote him back in.  The ""Great River Raft Initiative"" commences immediately. Chad orders the dismantling of what little structure remains ‚Äì rusted seat frames, warped roof panels, cracked floorboards ‚Äì to construct flimsy, leaky rafts. He diverts personnel from food gathering and shelter maintenance to this new, pointless task. ""Believe in the river!"" he commands, as his followers begin the back-breaking work of dragging the useless rafts across the parched earth. The camp splinters. Chad's fervent ""Raft Believers"" clash with Brenda's increasingly desperate ""Shelter Maintainers,"" who see their flimsy home literally disappearing around them. Fights break out over scrap metal, usable lengths of wire, the last remaining tarp. Amidst the chaos, another election is called. It‚Äôs a shouting match, possibly involving hurled clods of dry earth. Brenda narrowly wins, primarily because several key Raft Believers get into a violent argument over whether square or pointed bows are more hydro-dynamically suited for a non-existent river.  Brenda inherits utter chaos. The bus structure groans ominously, threatening collapse. The rafts lay abandoned, monuments to wasted effort. Her first act is to halt all raft work and order the scavenged materials used immediately to shore up the collapsing bus shell. Strict rules about resource sharing and communal duties are imposed with draconian rigor. There's no talk of travel, only triage. ""We stabilize, we survive,"" she states flatly, extinguishing any lingering sparks of Chad's manufactured hope. Life becomes even grimmer, a tightly controlled regimen of patching, rationing, and waiting. The tense truce between factions holds, but resentment simmers.  Chad, deprived of a grand project, resorts to whispers and insinuation. He wanders the desolate camp, murmuring to the most downtrodden Ramblers about ""Brenda's lack of vision,"" how the rafts were almost ready, how things felt more hopeful before. He doesn't need a plan anymore; he just needs to remind people how miserable they are and associate that misery with Brenda's leadership. ""Remember excitement?"" he asks, conveniently omitting the near-death experiences that accompanied it. The monotonous, grinding reality of their existence wears down resistance. The memory of Chad's specific disasters ‚Äì the hike, the rafts, the Luxury Lane, the riverbed ‚Äì begins to blur once more, overshadowed by the gnawing emptiness of the present. Another vote is called. The air hangs thick and still, heavy with the dust of past failures and the crushing weight of the seemingly endless cycle.",epyoch,2025-04-30T16:53:46,2

"He's been in office over 100 days and only made it worse with no signs of improvement. It is hard to tell at this point if he truly doesn't understand that the markets are reacting  negatively to tariffs or is lying to buy time.  I think a huge chunk of the problem is they truly believe people will keep spending the same way once tariffs kick in. That seems to be a huge driver behind the Amazon blowback- they don't want people to realize the price is higher. That's a big freaking mistake. The signs are there people will not. They are so out of touch they do not understand how stretched people were going into tariffs and that people are not willing to go into more debt. People will skip meals to keep their houses. Some will be fucked, but the excess spending is already stopping. It will likely not come back to former levels in our lifetimes if the tariff effects are even the middle of the road predictions. People will not go bankrupt as quickly as they think and drag out the pain of the economy (the bankruptcy is unfortunately a part of the strategy for the rich to buy up properties cheap- a key reason Trump is obsessed with lowering interest rates so they can finance cheaper and convince poorer people to go into debt quicker)",whichwitch9,2025-04-30T09:47:36,1

Many problems the AfD brings up are real, and failing to acknowledge and address those is a huge failure of our government.

"#This Is Not Hypocrisy ‚Äî It‚Äôs Strategic Disinformation --- What we‚Äôre witnessing is not a failure to live up to moral standards ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **intentional misuse of moral language** to manipulate, discredit, and dominate.  This is not hypocrisy. It is a coordinated strategy grounded in propaganda, epistemic sabotage, and information warfare.  These actors do not believe in consistent ethical principles. They invoke concepts like ‚Äútruth,‚Äù ‚Äúmorality,‚Äù or ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù only when doing so helps them achieve power. The moment those ideas stop serving them, they are discarded. That‚Äôs not contradiction ‚Äî that‚Äôs **manipulation through moral framing**.  --- They use: * **Agnotology** ‚Äì the deliberate creation of ignorance and confusion to obstruct understanding.   * **Epistemic sabotage** ‚Äì the destruction of trust in credible knowledge systems, often by equating expert consensus with partisan opinion.   * **Propaganda techniques** ‚Äì including projection, false equivalence, misdirection, and manufactured outrage.   * **Performative virtue signaling** ‚Äì strategic displays of morality not to express values, but to attack enemies and signal group loyalty.  --- This is **not a crisis of awareness or inconsistency**. It is **a deliberate information strategy** designed to: * Erode public trust   * Undermine institutions   * Collapse shared reality   * Exhaust the public‚Äôs ability to respond coherently    --- **Framing this behavior as hypocrisy implies confusion or failure**. But these tactics are methodical and effective. Calling it ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù misdiagnoses the problem ‚Äî and allows it to continue.  **You are not witnessing contradiction. You are witnessing authoritarian tactics in operation.**",panormda,2025-04-30T11:58:54,58

"They also point to low gas prices in summer of 2020 as some kind of win for Dump. Like yeah, was anything else happening in summer 2020 to crater gas prices? Some kind of global pandemic or something?",MentalEntropy,2025-04-30T12:00:45,25
It blows my mind that the price of oil is even a metric for how well a president is doing when these same people argue for free markets without government involvement. I hate to tell them how much oil would cost without government subsidies and geopolitical pressure to keep the prices artificially low in the USA.,spiralenator,2025-04-30T12:13:04,3

"Personally I think we need a representative system not a winner take all system.   Like how basically every European country does their legislature/parliament?   You don't vote for the person so much as you vote for the party, and then proportional to the votes the party receives that number of seats. This is basically the only way that we get out of hyperpolarized partisanism, it's what worked for the whigs and the Tories.  But of course our system was designed with the idea that we would not have political parties being part of its base assumptions.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-04-30T11:30:08,1
