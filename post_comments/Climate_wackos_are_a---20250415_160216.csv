My dogs are part of my family and I will defend and protect them as they were my children.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T18:15:29,11
I think the atf got a little chub from this.   And all this time we thought dogs were innocent victims to the ATF 2A infringement... Turns out they were the targets all along...,thatfordboy429,2025-04-15T17:00:48,6
Yet no mention how absolutely devastating to the ENTIRE ecosystem cats are. Probably the worst invasive species everywhere they have been introduced. Even woke as hell Australia still has a bounty on feral cats.,jmartin251,2025-04-15T18:57:10,10
Watch out. They will be coming for us next. Explaining it as “mouth breathers contribute the most to carbon emissions…”,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-17T00:05:59,1

You obviously don't have pets.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T20:09:42,4
"I have had pets, and I always knew the difference between the tiny tiger who would eat us if we died before it and the human beings all related to each other.  Never once did anyone in my family see the cat on equal standing with the people.  But you go ahead and play the part of ""cat person.""  Just like Taylor Swift.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-15T20:12:56,-7
Well I so much enjoy people who ASSUME things not in evidence.  I happen to have 3 dogs and only 1 cat between my wife and I.  They are family and apparently you don't care about your pets as much as me or most people I know who own them and consider them as important as human family.  Good day.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T20:27:15,7
"Two very different animals.  Cats are opportunists, and will eat you if you die.  Dogs are ever faithful, and will pine at your grave.  There are myriad of examples of dogs giving their lives for humans.  I'm unaware of a single case where a cat sacrificed itself for a human.  As one comedian quipped, when the vet says Fluffy's kidneys are failing, we say it's time to get another cat.  If the dog's kidneys are failing, Rex is on a  helicopter to Northwestern Hospital, with a new dog kidney being police-escorted through downtown Chicago at high speed.",Carl-j88aa,2025-04-15T23:01:08,2
"The human race doesn't deserve doggos, but they stay by our side anyway. No amount of people can compare to man's goodest boy.",Cazekz,2025-04-16T21:34:09,1
