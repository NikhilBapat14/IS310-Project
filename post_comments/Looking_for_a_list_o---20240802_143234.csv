"Ballotpedia has a running page on the statistics involving uncontested/contested elections, but itâ€™s not a comprehensive list.   [Ballotpedia Page](https://ballotpedia.org/Analysis_of_uncontested_elections,_2024)  Otherwise, you would have to probably go state by state on their websites and look at the official statewide ballots.",Zeddo52SD,2024-08-02T16:59:09,2
"I know 270towin tracks this at a national level.  https://www.270towin.com/2024-house-election-uncontested-races/  At a local level, I would imagine there is no easy way to get that data, and there is likely no easy compilation of uncontested seats at the House level, but that would certainly be easier to track down.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-02T20:23:09,1
