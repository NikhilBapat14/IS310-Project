"Half the people on the podium at the last primaries had plenty of merits, but like Harris, they had the unfortunate qualities that have apparently been most important for Dem voters for the last 3 elections- not-male, non-white, non-cishet-ness.

"Don't care, not clicking on a Fox News link.  Also a quote can always be taken out of context and spun, especially one this short. This is an important fact in using your critical thinking skills to make up your mind about stuff.  In any case, I don't trust Fox News' analysis of anything and never will.

Conservatives shift their position to maintain control of a conversation.  The goal doesn't change.  What is important at any moment is to appear to be controlling the conversation.  This is what is remembered and not the content.,TintedApostle,2025-04-30T11:17:28,1
"Harris sure wasn't an ideal candidate.     That said, talking about who was or was not ""qualified"" to be the Democratic Presidential candidate is non-sensical when Trump--the least-qualified person to be a leader of any kind let alone POTUS--is on the ticket for the other side.     TL;DR: **This election wasn't about qualifications** and anyone suggesting otherwise is being disingenuous. You want to support Trump?

Kamala Harris wasn’t unqualified. Donald Trump is unqualified.  Saying Harris wasn’t your pick is one thing.  But to act like she’s unqualified when we have a giant example of unqualified in Donald Trump is a huge stretch.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-30T11:30:59,6
"I agree with your sentiment but saying Harris is unqualified is just wrong. She was never going to win and we should have had a true primary but she is highly qualified. Too many liberals just really didn't want to think America is as racist and misogynistic as it is.

You fucking neoliberals can only focus on identity politics.  It's crazy to me that you think that its okay that Democratic Party elites met behind closed doors to select a nominee for President of the United States instead of Americans exercising their right to vote.,Pale-Initial-3854,2025-04-30T13:30:14,3
"For real.  It actually made perfect sense for Democrats to run their VP the VP they elected!! The whole, ""But, perfect is the enemy of good!"" talk was clearly an attack on Harris and to confuse Dems from coming together meanwhile her opponent checks off deadly sins and his brainwashed blubbering supporters who also claim to be Christians  99% of the time just bobble their head along.",FrederickClover,2025-04-30T12:44:30,3
"""It wasn't really a coup because it was poorly organized (oh and also ignore all of the alternate elector stuff and attempts to delay the certification of the vote and all that)"" is not the ironclad defense you seem to think it is. A shittily orchestrated coup attempt is still a coup attempt. In fact, if your best defense of Jan 6th and all of the other attempts to overturn the results of an election is that the perpetrators couldn't have been guilty because they were too incompetent in their execution, it's not really a defense at all.",smithchez,2025-04-30T11:48:17,7
"“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”",scarf__barf,2025-04-30T12:39:44,2

Harris deserved to lose. She covered up Biden’s decline just as much as anyone else in the party. She got her due reward for betraying the trust of the American people and her party.
