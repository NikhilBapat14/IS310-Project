"Age wise, yeah. We need younger people in both parties.   That being said, David Hogg has a certain (understandable) opinion on gun ownership that many moderates may dislike. Restrictive gun laws really upset a lot of Americans  Edit: To clarify, David Hogg isn't a candidate, he has a PAC that is sponsoring young candidates to challenge ""safe"" distrcits. However, Hogg is Vice Chair of the DNC.",Xanto97,2025-04-22T14:36:44,288

"I’m just gonna jump in here and say that even if you believe there’s an age problem in the Democratic Party, which I do, there are better ways to make change in the Dem Party than by supporting David Hogg. This is the dude who has pretty questionable PAC practices in the past, has been credibly called a grifter by people he used to work with over his defunct progressive MyPillow competitor, and who celebrated the loss of Mary Peltola in Alaska, a pretty awesome Dem who had managed to flip a swing district one cycle earlier and is exactly the type of “near-perfect candidate for their district” that DNC leadership should be elevating, not trashing. A lot of the discussion around this initiative kind of takes at face value that he’s competent and has good instincts, and I would really just encourage people to not assume that.   Folks like AOC, when they challenge incumbent Dems, do it in a very targeted way. It gives me some solace that Hogg has said he’s targeting safe Dem seats, but my guess is the upshot of this is he’s going to waste a ton of money accomplishing very little and mostly just distract from the main goal of being able to retake the House in 2026.  I was personally pretty bummed when Tim Walz endorsed him for DNC vice chair. Frankly at this point the dude has a lot of questionable behavior on his past at this point, at least for me.",eggoed,2025-04-22T14:43:53,111

"For the out of power party to spend $20 million to primary their own safe seats instead of spending it on competitive seats (which there should be a lot of next year) is pure political malpractice, and that's before that Hogg and pals are openly using age as a metric of who to try to primary. If you told me his group is actually a GOP op meant to internally hurt the Democrats I'd believe it.  And before anyone says 'it's not dnc money', that's irrelevant. It's still setting a substantial amount of money on fire for pointless infighting that only help the GOP by someone who basically represents the DNC.

"I just think young people are both **A**) Less likely to have enough experience to run for a high level office **B**) Less likely to be supported by the US voting base, which typically wants to see candidates that are at least a bit older. Young people are good to have in government, but typically your life experiences at age 30 are not really representative of how you will feel at 40 when you are more experienced in life.  Also, just a side note - Dems should be really trying to stay away from Hogg. I know Redditors (who tend to skew very young and very liberal) will probably support him, but he is a one-way ticket to losing elections. His stances are very extreme and borderline delusional on gun control. He also was very happy when Mary Peltola (D from Alaska) lost because she wasn't ready to get on the 'take all the guns' train...in a state with bears and other dangerous wildlife. He strikes me as someone that will be popular with the younger crowd (along with the likes of AOC), but ultimately his views on the world are not realistic and are going to hurt the Democratic party even more.",Curze98,2025-04-22T16:33:06,19

David Hogg was given a more traditionally symbolic position and he has somehow misjudged it to mean that the Democratic Party willed him some reformative mandate.

No it really isn't.  He falls under the false premise that progressive voters always know better.  When the reality is the largest concentration of them cause an echo chamber and doesn't really help those in centrist districts.

He's wants to primary people who aren't effective, who aren't real Democrats, and who don't believe in what the party stands for.  Moderate Democrats only get in the way of progress, but he's not touching moderate incumbents if the district isn't solidly Democratic because that risks electing a Republican.  He is trying to get in more young people and I'm fine with that as long as they are real Democrats.  I think his strategy is great, and I'm glad he's getting people like James Carville upset.

"I think the answer is obviously yes - primary elections are *explicitly* for this purpose. We should be deciding, every single election, who the best candidate to run in the general election is. I understand why that answer is frequently the same candidate who won last election. But it's also quite clear that the answer frequently isn't that. It's trivially easy to point out examples like Feinstein where that was obviously the case.  The bigger issue here is how the Democratic party waffles back and forth on this concept. And you'll notice that they always seem to go the same direction. Pelosi, for example, has been very critical of primary challenges in general, and has repeatedly affirmed her support of incumbents across the board, even if those incumbents are [currently under investigation for corruption that they are quite obviously guilty of](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/23/nancy-pelosi-henry-cuellar/). Her own words:  > “I support my incumbents,” Pelosi said during an unrelated news conference in Austin. “I support every one of them, from right to left. That is what I do.”  It should be noted that Cuellar has since been indicted on money laundering, bribery and conspiracy charges.  On the other hand, [she has no problem endorsing a primary challenger if the incumbent is a progressive](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/23/pelosi-defends-joe-kennedy-endorsement-400307). This has become a major sticking point in the party, where [the DCCC has a 'vendor blacklist', which punish individuals who work for primary challengers](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/28/pelosi-ocasio-cortez-gaetz-congress-support-primary-battles-403794). Yet it is only the progressives who ever find themselves on that blacklist. Joe Kennedy's staff has remained off the list.  The American people are pretty familiar with this double standard already, [groups like the Sunrise Movement have done plenty to expose it](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/08/20/sunrise-movement-nancy-pelosi-joe-kennedy-ed-markey-endorsement-criticism/). Furthermore, Americans are pretty frustrated with the lack of organization among establishment Democrats, and a lot of Democratic voters believe that the failure to hold a primary in 2024 was largely responsible for Harris's loss.

Doing the above will take 20 seconds.    They don't have time for this cultural stuff that simply motivates Republicans to stay Republican.  Not many people are that fired up about guns, but most of those who are really, really love guns.  That makes guns a poor platform item for Dems, as it helps the opposition while providing no benefit to their side.  Progressives think that they are a majority of the party.  But they are actually one of the smallest blocs in the party.  The rest of the party needs to have a series of Sister Souljah moments so that the progressive fringe does not brand the party for the rest of them.

"The biggest problem in the Democratic Party isn’t the age of the politicians. It’s the fact so many of them have taken donations from Zionists to back Israel’s genocide. If someone is willing to accept bribes to funnel US taxpayer funded weapons to a foreign country so they can ethnically cleanse a population, that individual doesn’t meet the bare minimum moral standard to be a leader. And considering they’re willing to look the other way when one of their donors murders tens of thousands of small children, they’re probably willing to look the other way on far lesser crimes as well.  The next time you see someone like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Corey Booker, John Fetterman, etc. “try their hardest to fight Trump,” but fail, just check their Open Secrets page. If their top donor is a Zionist organization like AIPAC, JStreet, Mainstream Democrats, etc. then they’re full of crap. They waited until after funding all of Trump’s requests to start pretending to protest because they take donations from the exact same Zionist donors as Trump and the Republicans.  https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mike-johnson/summary?cid=N00039106  https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/hakeem-jeffries/summary?cid=N00033640  If David Hogg is willing to go after corrupt incumbent Democrats, I’m on board as long as he doesn’t replace them with similarly corrupt younger politicians. I don’t really care whether the new politicians are centrist or progressive as long as they aren’t blatantly corrupt. My standard is ankle high, but most incumbent Democrats still aren’t able to clear the bar.    I don’t know much about Hogg’s views, but I think his gun rights position is based on personal trauma, not logic. Now that NRA is dead, there’s a massive surge in left wing gun ownership. There’s also a big rethink about how to combat gun violence. The problem is lack of mental healthcare, lack of economic opportunity, and the illicit drug trade. Together, they result in suicides, school shootings, domestic violence, and gang violence. Universal healthcare, UBI, and legalizing drug use are the cheapest and most effective ways to fix these problems. That’s not what the special interest groups in power today want, so there’s a ton of resistance. But it’s the only thing that will work in my opinion.   By the way, I don’t think the existing left vs. right dynamic applies when I criticize special interest groups. I think labor unions and small businesses are often just as corrupt as large corporations and financial firms. There’s plenty of evil billionaires out there, but I honestly think George Soros and Charles Koch are in a similarly trustworthy category as Bernie Sanders. They all rank far above most of the politicians and oligarchs who run the US today. Ideology is one thing. Integrity is another. By this I mean that even if you don’t agree with Soros, Koch, or Sanders’ views on a given topic, you can trust them to stick with it.   Meanwhile, it’s shocking how many self-described liberals quickly turned into fascists over the past year. Or how many left and right wing non-profit leaders turned out to be stealing from their own members (which is what killed the NRA.) Or how many free trade loving tech billionaires suddenly started backing tariffs when they realized they were being outcompeted by Chinese rivals. Or how many free speech loving universities, newspapers, and social media websites started engaging in propaganda and censorship.  This all sucks, but we don’t have to forfeit. There’s still a chance to come back from this as a society. David Hogg may or may not to turn out to be a good leader, but he’s at least an unknown quantity. Meanwhile, most of our Democratic and Republican leaders alike are truly awful politicians and even worse human beings. I don’t want to leap into the unknown, but sitting still is certain death.

Or established Dems offered a shorter educational program with the goal of identifying new talent and providing foundational resources for the growth of more youthful candidates? I agree spending vast resources against each other does not benefit the party with a few exceptions: corruption, missing votes, not engaging with constituency... I'm sure there are more issues that justify a primary challenge. Age shouldn't be the only factor. Could we as a party not decide that all our candidates would receive an examination for physical and mental health status with release of a summary of results?

"The Democratic party is still mostly operating by 1990s logic. That was fine for the 90s -- it was the only way to win so soon after the popular Reagan presidency -- but it's been over 30 years, and it's time to move on. The problem with older servants is less that they are old, than it is that they are more stubbornly set in their ways, and unlikely to change.  Though the genuinely old and sick should step aside, if only so we don't have an unwanted vacancy there due to a foreseeable death. Looking at you, Diane Feinstein. Gotta bow out before you reach that point.  That said, a party apparatus only works if the members of that party trust it, and vice versa. Hogg is creating instability, and that could thwart party organization and undermine the effectiveness of the DNC to win elections. Remaking the party has to come from the grassroots level, I think. It has to be organic, bottom-up, rather than top-down. We need the old guard to lose through primaries thanks to hardworking new candidates like AOC in 2018, and not because Hogg is using his clout to tip the scales.  That said, the DNC *could* exert its influence by recruiting new candidates for open or republican seats.

"To be clear though, David Hogg isn't the candidate.  He has a PAC that sponsored young candidates in 2024 and is going to do so again in 2026.  A lot of House and Senate members have these.  This has sort of become a bigger story than it needs to be because Hogg is very public and a bit of a lightning rod.  However, I think it is probably a good thing that he has a PAC that is basically sponsoring moderate and progressive young reps for primaries in safe blue seats.  Some reasonable challenges are good.  And even if they do not win, it can light a fire and force a candidate who is coasting either not being a vocal member of congress for their district or not providing good constituent services to step up.  And if they lose and we get a better, younger rep in a safe blue seat we aren't at risk of losing in the GE, then that's also a good outcome.  And given we have PACs like AIPAC and the Fairshake cryptoPAC (and FTX's PAC before them) donating millions of dollars and breaking records for spending in Democratic primaries to elect more corrupt and worse representatives, I think Hogg's PAC is not only good, but really the least of our worries.  If Democrats want to ban all PAC spending in primaries, that could actually be a good step and of course Hogg should respect it.

"Depends who you ask. In some interpretations, the 2nd amendment is only for militia. In others it's only for ""well-regulated"" militia, which excludes pretty much every militia other than State Guards and the National Guard. The common interpretation of it being for ""everyone"" was challenged when it was accepted and has been repeatedly challenged ever since.   Even the meaning of ""to bear arms"" has been debated—hotly and extensively—for at least the last century and a half.

My point isn't to interpret the 2nd amendment—people far more informed than I have been trying for over a century _and **failing**_. My point is this: don't count on the 2nd Amendment to save you when shit hits the fan.

Instead, use the carrot. Walk into your local county Dem party. Say I want to help. This is what I want to accomplish. List all the things that you want to see accomplished. And then volunteer to be a rep at the state convention. Make your values the priority of the Dem party. They literally want you to do this.

It was a really effective tactic, because it got people who a Dem vote was 100 percent in their interest to do everything to tell the impressionable that the Dems wanted genocide.

I think statistically you could get two different statisticians to give you two different results for exit polls but that part is absolutely undeniable.   I would push back on the feelings don't matter part of it. Like the economy, feelings about things when it comes to elections tend to influence the results quite strongly. The only data point I have that's undeniable is the vote total.

I also will totally admit that people like who you're describing exist I just think the numbers and where they influence people were far different.

Biden *is* largely at fault. He not only failed to enforce his own feeble red lines, he provided $30 billion via executive order to enable it. Harris' refusal to state much more than the gaslight of the 'Israel has a right to defend itself' line, along with saying she wouldn't change much, make those criticisms valid.      >Is it a logical stretch to then say the party that generally looks at treating others well, as having empathy as requisites for leadership   Given the foreign policy during past democratic administrations lead by interventionists, I'd say no.
