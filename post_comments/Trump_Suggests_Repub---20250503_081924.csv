So the military is supposedly going to help state and local crime (one of his latest EOs) and now we get rid of democrats.  Does this not sound like we are becoming a military state with an authoritarian ruler?  There is a reason why Hegseth is firing so many generals who stand in his way as the military is not to be used for domestic gatekeeping.,AdventurousLet548,2025-05-03T08:47:19,3270

">There is a reason why Hegseth is firing so many generals  Which should be pretty scary for people given the military is probably already the last line of defence for US Democracy given the Republican Congress is seemingly completely unwilling to stop him doing anything.  Trump is clearly not going to accept an election loss in 2026/2028 let alone a massive defeat so what happens next?  If he'd had the military and law enforcement leaders in place in 2020 to do it then he would have overturned that election result because we know from the testimony of those around him that that is exactly what he tried to do.  He does have those people now in Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and Pete Hegseth who by my estimation won't even blink when they are told to fix the result.  From that point on they will fully go after the Democratic Party, non-loyalist media and the Democratic donors.    Best case in reaction to mass protests would be a military coup but Trump people know that which as you point out is why they are getting ahead of events and stacking the military with loyalists and getting rid of non-loyal generals.

This is stupid anyway since Democrats are almost assured to win the House back, and he will be impeached.

"> Can you imagine if Joe Biden wrote something like that to his constituents?  Just to point out...  This is really simple game-theory - yet the Democrats are so unbelievably incompetent at it, it's infuriating.  You have two sides.  One side is willing to do *whatever it takes* for their side.  There is no law they won't break, no norm, no decorum.  They will do literally anything in-aid of their side's goals.  The other side, on the other hand, ***is not*** willing to do whatever it takes.  They have to be The Good Guys who build bridges, instead of tearing them down.  Now, look where this gets you...  When the GOP has power, Republicans get illegally/corruptly helped - and the Dems get illegally/corruptly punished (like here, the GOP is literally talking about throwing their opponents in-jail).  The Republicans push through their entire agenda.  Every time they have power, the country moves massively to the right.  When the Dems have power, things are different:  the Republicans actually get helped a little bit (have to show everyone how bipartisan we are!!!) - and the Dems get no corrupt/illegal help at all.  The Dems ***do not*** push through their agenda (not bipartisan!!!), they do not punish anyone from the previous administration (that's not healing and bringing the country back together, no matter how many crimes they committed!), and the country only moves imperceptibly back to the left.  Now, look at the Big Picture...  Where did 'they go low, we go high' get you?  The country moves massively right - then a tiny bit left - then massively right...  Every cycle, the country moves inexorably right.  Never left by any meaningful amount.  Your side gets corruptly punished - or nothing.  Those are the two options you give your side:  extremely-bad (under Republican leadership) and nothing (under Dem leadership).  However, you give your opponents a far better choice:  they get corruptly helped (when the GOP has power) or helped a little bit (when the Dems have power).

Sorry bro but no Republicans have ever questioned their vote. They've had the results brought in front of their faces and literally none have ever said they would not vote for Trump again. They only regret that his policies affected them personally. The cult has taken over the country. The supreme court is cooked. They won't stop him from running again. The Democrats are largely feckless.   The only true hope is that when he dies the Republican party won't have a true leader.

I'm curious though - *do you think MAGA Catholics or Christians would stop supporting MAGA if their religious leaders condemned the movement?* Would the threat of excommunication be enough?  This is the context for me as an outsider: almost always in Europe, if you are religious you stick to that one, unless something massive happens (e.g. when women were allowed to become priests in the Anglican/Episcopalian Church of England, a few moved to the Roman Catholic church).  However, it seems in the US, Christians are much more flexible about moving between different denominations.   One person (coincidently, also from Alabama) I know converted from Baptist to Catholic because she ""liked"" the Catholic church in her town more - which I was amazed by, considering it seemed there was no deep thought about the theological differences or any particular element of what the Catechism and Catholic church teaches.

">when women were allowed to become priests in the Anglican/Episcopalian Church of England, a few moved to the Roman Catholic church  I also know of the opposite, ie, quite a few Catholics who became Anglican because of this and views towards sexuality and gender more generally; even after the changes, I know Anglicans who were raised as Catholics and switched as soon as they were old enough to be able to independently. There are Anglo-Catholic (which is Anglican) churches that are liturgically and to a large extent theologically almost the same as Roman Catholic churches, but with very different social views, and significant portions of their congregations are often converts.  But these are serious choices for those involved, not just shopping around. A fair number of Anglo-Catholic converts I know would barely be willing to step foot in a Roman Catholic church for any reason.  >I'm curious though - do you think MAGA Catholics or Christians would stop supporting MAGA if their religious leaders condemned the movement? Would the threat of excommunication be enough?  It may depend on the which leaders those are. It feels like MAGA Catholics have moved heavily toward evangelical Protestantism in practice and organization, and so can consider their own personal beliefs and the views of their local leaders more than the church hierarchy, often viewing the hierarchy as having been corrupted by whatever conspiracy theory they subscribe to. Pope Francis *did* come out with a pretty direct (for the pope) condemnation of Trump, saying that anyone who wanted to choose their vote based on which candidate was ""pro-life"" needed to realize that neither candidate was, because Trump was hostile to the lives of people who had already been born.

"> It makes me think I have no understanding of society.  Because voters are all over the place. Many vote on policy. Some vote on vibes (like some in that article, ""I feel like you both are real""). Some vote based on geography - [in this map of the 2018 Dem. LG primary in Pennsylvania](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Pennsylvania_lieutenant_gubernatorial_Democratic_primary%2C_2018.svg/500px-Pennsylvania_lieutenant_gubernatorial_Democratic_primary%2C_2018.svg.png) you can see Fetterman's vote (blue) correlate with how far away a county is from his home county of Allegheny (candidate home counties are listed on PA ballots), while Cozzone (in red) was county commissioner in the dark red county on that map.   Some prefer those of their own ethnic group - for an example local to me, a man formerly known as Phil Spiwak [changed his name to Shannon O'Malley](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/illinois-judge-candidate-insists-he-s-o-malley-critics-call-n845651) to try and get some sort of knock-on support from Irish-American voters here in Chicagoland, and also was very careful to never show his face in ads he ran so as to not disabuse voters of the notion they were voting for a woman. I think that was what (partially) helped both AOC and Gallego (the two people mentioned in that article) - Hispanics have been shifting away from Dems post-Hillary (this is seen in 2018, 2020, and 2022 results to varying extents among different Latino communities), and that continued in 2024. But some certain % of Hispanic voters who would have voted for a Republican downballot in a white v. white race or sat it out instead decided to back Democratic Hispanic candidates running for those positions. I'm not saying every Hispanic/Asian/Irish-American etc. out there votes like this, but it's enough to add up when you look at it big-picture.

Heck, I don't necessarily think it must be electoral policymaking successes even.

"One of my favorite journalists recently revealed he voted Jill and tried to be as honest as possible when interviewing her at a rally, which meant naturally it had a pretty positive light because the Green Party usually appeals to ethics and morals more than anything else, it's hard for their own statements to sound bad. It's the greater context that makes Green a useless party to say it gently.  He saw her basically disappear after the election, and he and all of his friends pretty much looked around and went 'did we get fucked over?'.  He pretty much said in vague terms he wouldn't be that surprised if she WAS a candidate for the exact reason you say, that he feels like his vote was a waste to the race  I also am shocked at just HOW ballsy these presidential delinquents are honestly.

"You should really give Star Trek a look if you haven't before. Not only is it one of the most optimistic franchises about the capacity for humans to rise above our harmful and destructive tendencies by fully embracing our best qualities, but also posits a path to get there.  Based on the history in Star Trek, I would argue that the writers contend two conditions are necessary to set up humanity for a better future.  1) Some type of critical event that breaks down the artificial barriers between us and sparks a paradigm shift in our perceptions of each other in such a way that people think less of themselves as a part of a specific culture or nation and more as one small part of a much greater global or even universal whole. In Star Trek, that was World War III followed by first contact with the Vulcans, but it doesn't have to be specifically those kinds of events. I don't believe we need our own post-atomic horror or benevolent aliens to accomplish this. Anything that finally gets people to look beyond themselves as a group can do this.  2) Developing the technological and socioeconomic framework that enables all people to have their basic needs provided for in a post-scarcity society. This is perhaps the most fundamental component of the utopian thesis in Star Trek. The show openly acknowledges that humans are most likely to succumb to their worst tendencies when they are suffering. Therefore, ensuring that everyone is guaranteed the right to their basic needs in a society that is capable of providing them is crucial. Star Trek represents this with near-limitless access to clean energy, food-replicating technology, and a moneyless, classless society (for the most part) that makes these abundant resources available to all.

I‚Äôm not arguing for trans identifying females to be forced to use women‚Äôs only spaces  Idc if trans identifying females want to be in men‚Äôs spaces  Men spaces are not a protected spaces that had to be fought  My argument is to keep trans identifying males out of women‚Äôs only spaces,ProTrumpProLife,2025-05-03T17:15:27,0

">The solution is make it law that trans identifying males are not to enter women‚Äôs only spaces  Beyond the obvious reality that you would just expand those limits to encompass all spaces, then try to end all trans people, I don't trust the minority that have to walk around asking what women are constantly to understand what women spaces are.  >They can fight for their own space instead of invading women‚Äôs spaces  They did. That's why they're there in the first place. You just don't like them and find this to be a convenient place to start, the same way the Nazi's did ironically.  >You‚Äôre gonna say we want genital checks because we can‚Äôt get them all without it but that‚Äôs not needed  No. That's what you want, because like most people who don't know what a women is, you really just want an accessible way to sexually assault and harass people.  >Make it law, and people who get caught breaking the law will get either jail time or a citation  Already a thing bud.  >Just because we can‚Äôt stop them all or catch them all does not mean we should not enforce keeping males out of women‚Äôs only spaces  We already do that.

"Yes that should encompass ALL women‚Äôs only spaces  Including sports, restrooms, and any space that is only for women  A woman is an adult human female. Women fought to have separate spaces from the male sex. They should not have to fight to keep their spaces from trans identifying males. It should already be that women‚Äôs only spaces not allow any type of male    Trans identifying males can get their own third space or use the spaces that align if their sex  They do not get to use spaces for women just because they self identify   Trans identifying males should not be stealing scholarships from women, and spots on teams from women. Not matter how small the trans space is doesn‚Äôt matter. They are still affecting real women, and intruding on women‚Äôs right to their own space",ProTrumpProLife,2025-05-03T18:11:30,1
You have no argument not to. You have an opinion. A fact is that more people are hurt by priests than trans people. Your inflated ego is making you think your opinion is a fact.,Designer-Garage2675,2025-05-03T20:45:18,1
