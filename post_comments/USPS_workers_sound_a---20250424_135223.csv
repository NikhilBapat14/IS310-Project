"It's astonishing how something so fundamental to so many people, especially in rural areas, is jeopardized by vested interests. It seems to me we too often forget that correspondence isn't just about mail and letters; it's about connection, it's about community. This should concern us all",HoneyDusk_,2025-04-24T14:05:56,44

"We sounded the alarm with Louis DeJoy. We knew this was coming. If there is a critique I have of the Biden administration is them not working on the Board members enough. They could have pressured them in various ways to force his ouster. They chose to be ""middle ground"" on that one. We are paying now.  Expect XPO to come in with private contracts for this one.",williamgman,2025-04-24T14:11:18,28

I heard in my area USPS is no longer doing mail pickup after 11 AM. Seems like a severe reduction in distribution.,philovax,2025-04-24T18:53:40,3
Something is definitely going wrong at the USPS.   I‚Äôve had a shipment in limbo for over a week with very vague updates and had multiple days without mail at a PO box for my business.   And then last week when i went to pick up mail - post office was closed 30 min after it was supposed to open and didn‚Äôt actually open until i tracked down the direct line - not the 800 number listed on the USPS website.   I was very nice about them being closed and offered to help - because you know‚Ä¶.  And they opened up right away and i said please and thank you and ran to my truck.,clintfrisco,2025-04-24T23:42:01,3

"I know employees that want USPS dismantled, because they‚Äôll be fine with the benefits they‚Äôll get and it‚Äôll be revenge towards coworkers and bosses they hate.  I‚Äôd like to see the people cheering for the dismantling of USPS, feel some pain, but that wouldn‚Äôt be possible without innocent employees suffering, too.  There‚Äôs a lot wrong with USPS, mostly a lot of workers with burnout. They have to focus on Amazon deliveries more than regular mail deliveries, and the Amazon deliveries is where the burnout is hitting some workers. Those deliveries take more time than their regular deliveries. The burnout is doing some serious damage to the minds of some of the employees.  I barely get all of my mail on a regular basis, but my packages always make it just fine, when I have any. For my 2022 W2. I had to go online to get it, because it wasn‚Äôt delivered to my mailbox, even though I had an e-mail from the updates USPS offers on mail delivery, saying my W2 was delivered. I was so annoyed. After that, I stopped relying on USPS for that.",SimthingEvilLurks,2025-04-25T05:55:51,2

"It's about $4 for Denmark as of 2020.  The U.S. has about the cheapest first class postage of any country in the developed world. This is remarkable considering how freaking big this country is. It's one thing to be able to get a letter across a country like Denmark, but it's quite another two send a letter from Miami to Portland Oregon.
