They keep acting like deals are just days away not because its true because they are trying to calm wall street. The last 6 days of the Market does not seemed based in reality. Its like they are trying to be blindly optimistic despite every indicator saying they should not be.,sedatedlife,2025-04-30T18:24:31,6

"Deals like that normally takes 1-2 years of negotations. Ain't no way other countries just brush negotations like that in few days. Hell, Ukraine-US mineral deal took 3 months and that's when one country is desperate and in rush, in middle of war and is in disadvantage.  You think like countries will negotatie deals that will impact their whole country economy, job market, political elections etc. in week or few hours (cause that's how long they would need to last so he can sign 200 deals) ?!!

We have a month before shelves are quite literally going to be empty.  At that point it will take another month even if deals are reached that day for ships to reach LA.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-30T18:27:20,4
