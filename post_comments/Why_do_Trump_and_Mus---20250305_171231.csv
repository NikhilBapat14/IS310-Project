"Trump wants to give tax cuts to rich people,  but he can’t, deficits are already too big. He has to cut something. But nothing is big enough. Most of the federal government expenses are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the military and interest on the national debt.Everything else put together, foreign aid, NASA, the Justice Department, National Parks, the CDC, border patrol, etc… doesn’t come close to those big items. They could get rid of literally the entire US government, besides those five things, and still not be able to balance the budget, let alone cut taxes more.  What Trump wants to do is impossible, what DOGE says they are going to do (2 trillion in cuts) is impossible. All they are doing is making a lot of noise firing all those federal workers. It won’t have much of an effect on the deficit and certainly not pay for Trump tax cuts. So they have to attack something big like Social Security.  But people like Social Security so they need a reason to cut it that people will accept. Finding waste, fraud and abuse (I’m so sick of hearing those terms) is a handy cliche and is good political theater they can use to justify doing something everybody is going hate. It also justifies the existence of DOGE, something else a lot of people are hating on, if they are out there fighting the boogie man. That fact that the boogie man is made up matters not even a little bit. As long as they can convince enough people that the boogie man is real and is a threat it lets them do whatever they want.  Musk and Trump are really good and absolutely relentless at weaving whatever reality suits their ambitions. They’ll keep at it no matter how dumb the narrative is is or how thoroughly it’s been debunked.

"# PhD in Computer Science here….  The CAP Therom states databases can be at most two consistent, available, and partitioned.

Scale that by millions of employees manually changing data over decades. There's a zero percent chance the data is correct.  Does that mean fraud and waste? Undefined. It means theres bogus records that are valid in government systems. Depending on how those records are used cross-department there could be issues  Suppose the student loan system only cares that the ssn system known a record is valid. In that case, you could get a loan using a 200-year-old Ssn. It doesn't mean someone has that loan— only that its possible.

"First and foremost I think they are manipulating public opinion about *them*. One, their claims are absurd and everything absurd and exaggerated is easily remembered (and catches on); two, these BS spread; three, when going widespread, it damages dems' reputation (congress approved funds, but they are blaming dems/biden), while at the same time portraying trump+musk as saviors above suspicion.  You see, to me it's not about social security *per se*. Yeah, of course they would privatize it if heard good proposals from wallstreet (w/ corruption included), but they're just *using* social security because, well, it became available to them at this moment. With trump (which he learned from his first campaign), it's more about 'getting authority though spectacle + hating an enemy' then about influencing voters by proposals and ideas and stuff. Trump and his best minds assembly of aids are strong in the first, mediocre at the latter.  Problem is, standing up against this strategy is very difficult without society's help. When you fact check current BS, he's already in the next round and damage is already done. When a lot of the population doesn't care about politics, all these made-up facts fly. That's why he threatened to arrest zuckerberg: fact checking right into his posts was very dangerous for him. Dems, I think, can't fight this simply because most of the population either doesn't care or is maga.  When people start feeling the consequences personally (ie, in their pockets), then there's a chance. Of course, there'll be another round of BS and lies and another enemy to blame, but by then hopefully the affected voters will be bothered enough to start questioning stuff and thinking for themselves.",Str4425,2025-03-06T05:27:04,3

"This is Trump's normal move before he tries to destroy something. He claims it is riddled with fraud, like he did with the presidential elections. He claimed that in both 2016 and 2020 the votes were ""horrible"" and full of fraud. Therefore they can't be trusted.  He's still doing it for the ""Russia hoax"" as he calls it. He did in fact have numerous meetings, calls, and emails with the Russians and he did lie about them all. Russia did help him in the 2016 election. He's trying to erase that fact by constantly calling it a ""hoax"".  The whole effort is to discredit whatever Trump is against by claiming it is fraud. Now he's doing it for Social Security.  The simple fact is that Trump himself is a fraud, as has been found in court numerous times. He compensates by calling everything else a fraud.  Look for Social Security payments to be interrupted for the first time in 80 years.

Now bring on the investor bros who have yet to experience a 50% loss in their portfolios due to things like deregulation of the mortgage industry, or computer algorithms crashing the market as they did on Black Monday in 1987 and tell me how that $6.7 trillion in 401k money and the $300 billion a year in additional money isn't propping up inflated equities values.

"If your goal is to destroy something that is generally very popular, you have to start by convincing people that it should be unpopular.  Elon hates Social Security, describing it as a Ponzi scheme, but huge swaths of the American electorate are reliant upon it as their primary source of income.  So, to convince them that they should support cutting off their own income he tells them that it's riddled with fraud.    It's a very classic political bullshit artist move to make bold claims and point to something as evidence that doesn't say what you claim it says.  Our media has been largely cowed by years of accusation of bias to not call out lies but leave it to the opposition to call those out, so media outlets will largely just amplify what Elon says and tell Dems that it's their job to tell people that Elon is full of shit.  But the old saying in politics is that if you're explaining you're losing, the bullshit artists have realized they can largely make big claims backed by nothing and the public will rarely be informed that they're full of shit.    Eventually the media stops amplifying your bullshit, but that can take years - Jim Jordan spent the Obama years claiming reports his committee was releasing showed evidence of huge scandal only for it not to, but it took the better part of a decade for the non-GOP media to get it in their heads that he was full of shit and should be treated with skepticism rather than uncritically echoed.  Elon isn't tethered to that reputation for some reason that boggles my mind so he's going out and telling everyone that fraud is rampant, getting the claims echoed, and by the time people go, ""But that's not what your data says!"" the public is two scandals down the road already.",HombreFawkes,2025-03-06T11:36:31,2

"The strategy here is relatively simple. They are highlighting fraud, waste, and abuse. PART of that are inefficiencies and inaccuracies within the federal government systems and employees.

Bringing up the flaw in the SS data is to embarrass the federal system and workforce; and to highlight actual real inefficiencies. No matter how you look at it, the fact that there are these many people in the system and nobody has ever bothered to fix it, is unquestionably shameful.

"“They are claiming fraud because they want to LOOT Social Security and STEAL our money.”   There are serious problems with SS and saying things like this isn’t helpful; indeed it helps Trump. Ironically, the above quote is close to what’s happened with SS from the beginning.  If you’ve been paying into SS for over 40 years but aren’t old enough to start collecting, you’ve probably paid enough into SS to pay off your mortgage or even pay cash for a house if you were allowed to withdraw all of it in one lump sum.  But you’re not allowed to do that. Fact is, you’ll have to live a long long time to get back what you’ve put in. Is that OK with you?  If you die, your spouse can choose between receiving your payments or theirs, not both. If there’s no spouse, your heirs get nothing. The government gets it. Is that OK with you?  If the money you’ve been paying into SS had been invested in an S&P 500 index fund, SS wouldn’t be in financial difficulty today, having to consider raising the retirement age yet again or eliminating the income cap. Do you know where your payments are invested? They’re “invested” in government bonds!   That means the government spends it and issues an IOU!

When they set the record straight, all it is going to sound like is Democrats defending social security databases listing thousands of 150 year olds living in the US. This helps Trumps messaging just as much as if there actually was that much fraud, because it makes the democratic party look like they are the party fighting against the reform of wasteful spending.   The only move Democrats can make without making themselves look bad in front of the average voter is by saying ""this isn't as bad as it looks, but let us help you fix it with legislation."" But that would hurt them with their base, as it would require working with Trump, and it would appear to legitamize DOGE/Elon Musk.   Essentially, it puts Democrats in a lose-lose situation with very little risk to Trump's popularity. It doesn't matter if it's misleading, the truth is bad enough in the eyes of the population that it's a political win for Trump regardless.   This same concept is why they went after USAID, foreign aid is unpopular, and as much as we say that it is a very small portion of the budget, all it looks like is Democrats are defending spending millions on things like scholarships for students from Burma rather than spending it on Americans. Again, it's not a fair representation, but the optics are good for Trump and bad for Democrats.",getawarrantfedboi,2025-03-06T04:00:10,1

You are saying in all your earthly wisdom, you know what every programmer who coded in any language used to accommodate a language that didn't have a date type???  Unbelievable.

Listen Mensa candidate - when a programming language has a limitation like using strings in lieu of an actual date type, and a PROGRAMMER PROGRAMMING IN SAID LANGUAGE has to handle possible missing dates or incorrect inputs somehow, all kinds of goofy things can come up.  Some programmers would create routines that would give some obviously incorrect answer. That made finding bad data easier. You could do a search on birth date say May 20, 1897, and every file that came up with that date you would know had a bad input on the birth date.  These date discrepancies could also be the result of imported date from state systems, or anything else! The bottom line - if coders didn't force a standardized input relative to the date string field, who knows what kind of stuff can be stored.

"> You say it won’t deter, he says it will.  Yeah, and I'm also saying that the outcomes of street crime would be worse because more guns pretty consistently results in more injuries and deaths from guns. Obviously.  >What you’re saying is that people cannot be trusted.  More that people aren't *capable*. Even the best trained warriors on Earth make mistakes when fight-or-flight is on the table, and that's what we're talking about during a mugging or something that is just significantly more likely to escalate into bloodshed if there are *also* a couple guns in the fray than otherwise.  >Not just any people but everyone who isn’t in government. That’s a very left position isn’t it?   Not at all, skepticism of the government is an inherently leftist position.  >Nobody should protect themselves because the government is there to keep you safe from all harm.

We could probably own guns to high heaven and incur very little crime and *generally* I think that would be a good thing.  I think the right to bear arms is good, and I think liberals right now are kidding themselves while there are open-and-shut fascists running the show.

No, I've just read studies and I'm unwilling to let my personal hobbies (yay guns) cloud my judgement when reading them. Even in my ideal society, there would be more gun deaths than not, because crime will likely never TRULY be gone. The fact is, the more guns are privately-owned throughout society, the more at least *some* percentage of them will be used maliciously. That's just a fact - a fact rabid gun owners who don't want to face uncomfortable realities refuse to face, but a fact nonetheless.  >Tennessee just became an open carry state. It saw crime becoming an issue that was hard to control. What do the numbers show is that crime is still an issue regardless.   Right. And studies across the board find that carrying guns pretty much universally results in more gun injuries and deaths that simply are not reflected with inferior melee weapons, like knives and clubs. They just do. Tennessee's law is too recent to draw any statistically significant conclusions, but there's no reason to expect that they'll be any different - especially given that they're a red state with high poverty and minimal social welfare programs.

If we had a society that gave a shit about average people instead of rich people, where average people had time to live their lives and had decent amounts of time off and reliable housing, food, healthcare, education, etc. we probably could own all of the guns and have very, very, very minimal crime and gun violence.  But we don't live in that society, we live in a stupid, extremely right-wing one, so crime is a real thing that desperate, impoverished, overworked, destitute people resort to. And guns make that way, way easier, so they're utilized, and as a result we have an insane amount of gun injury and death in this country compared to countries with sensible gun control laws.  >Criminals already carry guns around regardless of laws.

You ask if the US military knows how to fight an infantry war? What makes you think the *American left* does, or will figure it out faster than the conventional military?

"Exactly right.  "" **The crisis in policing is the culmination of a thousand other failures—failures of education, social services, public health, gun regulation, criminal justice, and economic development.** Police have a lot in common with firefighters, E.M.T.s, and paramedics: they’re there to help, often at great sacrifice, and by placing themselves in harm’s way. To say that this doesn’t always work out, however, does not begin to cover the size of the problem. The killing of [George Floyd](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-floyd), in Minneapolis, cannot be wished away as an outlier. In each of the past five years, police in the United States have killed roughly a thousand people. (During each of those same years, about a hundred police officers were killed in the line of duty.) One study suggests that, among American men between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four, the number who were treated in emergency rooms as a result of injuries inflicted by police and security guards was almost as great as the number who, as pedestrians, were injured by motor vehicles. Urban police forces are nearly always whiter than the communities they patrol. The victims of police brutality are disproportionately Black teen-age boys: children. To say that many good and admirable people are police officers, dedicated and brave public servants, which is, of course, true, is to fail to address both the nature and the scale of the crisis and the legacy of centuries of racial injustice.

">A lot of the gun violence we see in America today would vanish if everyone had safe housing, healthy food, clean water, proper education, and free healthcare.  You're conflating violence and gun violence. You are correct, a lot of the *violence* would go away, including gun violence. The ratio of gun violence to violent crime would stay the same, however. It is a logical fallacy to say that improving base conditions would reduce gun violence. It would just reduce violence overall. It would be a noble cause and a good first step towards any violence reduction, but so long as firearms remain easily accessible the gun violence rate will be nominally higher here than other comparable first world countries.   Your argument really falls apart when you take into consideration the *many* third world countries with significantly lower quality of life that have a lower gun violence rate due to weapons being more restricted. Iraq is a noticeable example of a country with a lower gun violence rate compared to the US. Let that sink in.   We have enough data and evidence to pretty clearly say less guns equals less gun violence per violent crime rate. Arguing against that is saying your unempirically proven reality is more tangible than all of the empirical evidence to the contrary. I'm open to any counterpoint based on more than ""I feel this way,"" but as a person who owns multiple firearms and used to be of the same opinions as you, there just isnt much rational argument that gun restrictions don't lower gun violence.

The Police and Crime committee released a report in 2017 on London’s gun crimes, stating that ‘little is known about the drivers of gun crime in the capital’ \[12\]. Their report did suggest that gun crime may be increasing due to a ‘higher level of supply for firearms’. This trend seems highly likely.”  AOAV, **London’s Murders Examined: key figures in the UK capital’s homicides,** By **Sabrina Lavrut,** on 12 Apr 2022.

"You have clearly been misled.

"Oh, now its how someone gets rich, oh i see. You really had to think that out. Well, thats simple; if they get rich criminally, they don’t deserve it. I’m sure everyone agrees with that. But wait, you have your other limits which you weren’t too clear on. $400,00 a year you believe is the limit, right? Wow, what put the limit there besides your moral high ground? If a person makes 900K+ and turns around and hires people at the business he/she created setting him/her back to 400K, they aren’t allowed to make a profit? Then why bother employing anyone? Oops, there go job opportunities. Too bad. You have no fucking right to take money from someone who works do you? lower that rate and then have it happen to you and see what you think. How willing are you going to be to put you, lets say, at your limit to live (no travel money, no take the family out money, no money to help your kids when they need it), and have someone take the rest of your money because, hey they just want it. It doesnt matter if they do nothing to deserve it other than be alive. Crackheads deserve it don’t they? sure they do. Whats yours now belongs to some crackheads, to buy more crack. Thats your take. The rest of your entire argument simply falls flat.   But you are absolutely sure of your moral high ground. Why? because nothing has been taken from you. Thats why you want to stay ahead of the curve and take from others as if they aren’t equal to you. See, at the heart of your thieving opinion, you don’t believe people are your equal unless they think like you do, unless they’re poor like you are, unless they don’t understand why everyone really has equality, not equity in the United States just like you don’t understand.  For you to even say 400K a year is rich, in this economy, shows just how little you understand how business works, why it works and why making money, creating money, being responsible for other lives is something you would do best to learn.      I don’t make even 100K, which in reality puts me, living in so. california, at poverty level. That doesn’t stop me having the opportunity to make more. I got a house. Bought it when the market was down. Money isn’t all that important to me as it is to my wife. But fuck, if its all that to you, why don't you just get a certification, get a job, and get a life.

"Again, you're conflating ""criminals can still get weapons"" with ""criminals will have the same access to weapons."" The former statement is true, but the latter is not.   You completely ignored everything else about how the vast majority of gun related violence is spontaneous, and therefore would easily be curbed by increasing restrictions to access for firearms. You keep saying 'ban' even though I've never said anything of the sort.

"> Oh, now its how someone gets rich, oh i see. You really had to think that out.   No, not really. It's pretty fundamental to my political beliefs.  >$400,00 a year you believe is the limit, right? Wow, what put the limit there besides your moral high ground? If a person makes 900K+ and turns around and hires people at the business he/she created setting him/her back to 400K, they aren’t allowed to make a profit?   I didn't argue that ""$400,000"" was any kind of ""limit"". That's just the minimum annual income that I would argue makes someone ""rich"", in the conventional, conversational sense of the word.  > If a person makes 900K+ and turns around and hires people at the business he/she created setting him/her back to 400K, they aren’t allowed to make a profit?  I don't think people should be able to ""hire"" people. That's the bedrock of my political views. If you make $400,000 working your ass off, more power to you. If you make $400,000 by employing 20 people to make it for you, then gulag.  >Then why bother employing anyone? Oops, there go job opportunities. Too bad.   To idiots, sure. To everyone that isn't simping for the wealthy, it's pretty clear that job opportunities will continue to exist without the aristocracy, because work needs to get done and people will continue to do that work. If the c-suite of every major company evaporated tomorrow, the world would turn. Workers would still clock in, would still do the work, and the world would be like ""holy shit where did all these rich people go!"" and there'd be some gnashing of teeth as we figured out the passwords to their Gmail accounts or whatever, but by and large, the world would turn and we would be fine.  If every worker in the world vanished tomorrow, the c-suite of every company would be fast transformed into marauding, Mad Max style raiders trying to claw every resource they could for survival because a.) they don't actually know how to do that much work and b.) nothing would be getting produced, services wouldn't be rendered, etc. The people who create value are workers, who contrary to your view, would be able to find jobs just fine in a post-aristocratic world. The fact that conservatives consistently cape for the wealthy aristocrats is just a tradition that shamefully goes back centuries - conservatives today are just the same peasant-brained vassals of the 13th century who are fiercely loyal to their lord letting them work the land, instead of questioning why the lord ""owns"" the land in the first place.  >How willing are you going to be to put you, lets say, at your limit to live (no travel money, no take the family out money, no money to help your kids when they need it), and have someone take the rest of your money because, hey they just want it.   Not willing at all, given that that's the world I currently live in.   >It doesnt matter if they do nothing to deserve it other than be alive. Crackheads deserve it don’t they? sure they do.   Yes, crackheads are my countrymen and deserve dignity and treatment for their affliction. More to the point, I'm quite confident that if they HAD access to the stability of a home, three squares a day, and appropriate healthcare, we could make MOST crackheads into stable, productive members of society instead of simply writing off human beings as total losses.  >But you are absolutely sure of your moral high ground. Why? because nothing has been taken from you.   Oh, an economy where I can afford a house, one vacation a year, and a decent amount of time off has been taken from me. Not to mention due process, innocence until proven guilty by a reasonable doubt, democracy, legal equality with my female, LGBT, and non-white countrymen, etc. Plenty's been taken from me, but I'm not conservative, I'm a decent, honest human being, so there are things I care about that aren't just tallied up by dollars and cents.  >See, at the heart of your thieving opinion, you don’t believe people are your equal unless they think like you do, unless they’re poor like you are, unless they don’t understand why everyone really has equality, not equity in the United States just like you don’t understand.  On the contrary, I think everyone's equal. The only people who don't believe in human equality, are conservatives - which is why they feel the need to take down webpages dedicated to indigenous and black Americans who served their country dutifully, revoke same-sex marriage protections for LGBT couples, etc. That's why I think that crackhead should have the same shot at life that I had, when it's a statistical near-certainty that he probably grew up in an impoverished home without economic opportunities and may not have had a home *at all* growing up. You would have him die on the streets and call yourself ""moral"", I think we should care for our countrymen and our brothers and sisters in humanity *beyond* our national borders.  Equality as at the root of my ideology, it just isn't at the root of yours - you just don't understand my ideology and, crucially, you don't understand yours, either.  >For you to even say 400K a year is rich, in this economy, shows just how little you understand how business works, why it works and why making money, creating money, being responsible for other lives is something you would do best to learn.   I was once a right-wing Libertarian. I once made the same, ignorant ""you don't understand economics"" pleas as this one. Turns out, I was wrong, and the people who actually *do* understand economics are the communists, who understand it *exactly* as well as the capitalists do - the Libertarians (and conservatives) are just useful idiots for the capitalists, who understand full well that they're exploiting the 99% for their own material position.  They, rather understandably, don't want the gravy train to end, and they have ignorant mooks like you to fight for them - as conservatives have always fought for the aristocracy as far back as we can see.  >I don’t make even 100K, which in reality puts me, living in so. california, at poverty level.

"> That gay marriage link shows nothing but a disregard for other people’s beliefs.  Yeah. I don't care. I literally do not care that you're caping for raging bigots. I just know that decency compels equality before the law. So, if straight people can get married and enjoy certain government benefits as a result of that, then so too must gay people. Anything less than that is a.) caping for bigotry, and b.) creating a class of second-class citizens.  Which, of course, is the objective of the conservative political project - to make some people *more equal* than others, usually predicated on who and how they love, what God they worship, and what race they were born into. I do not care what religious *or* secular (but, lol, c'mon, zero of us are under any misconception that there are a bunch of atheists out there crying about gay marriage) bigotry people harbor, in the exact same way that I don't particularly care that segregationists ""aren't down with"" sharing bar stools and drinking fountains with black people.  > The church won’t marry a couple because it goes against their doctrine, so what, go somewhere else.  In virtually all circumstances, churches that proselytize that kind of bigotry aren't forced to marry gay people. Same-sec marriage recognition is about forcing the government to recognize them, and to afford those with same-sex marriage licenses the same benefits that straight couples are afforded. The country clerk is compelled, not some bigots who happen to be pastors.  > “The owner” of wealth, or business doesn’t have to share anything. But that’s what capitalism is great for. Anyone can become an owner.  But everyone can't be, and under capitalism, capital owners can, will, and do use their outsize wealth to influence the government to favor their interests over those of workers. So they'll pay people poverty wages for the labor that makes everything possible, while they produce absolutely nothing - but keep the lion's share of the wealth.  I think the people who do the work should keep... all of the wealth.  > You just want that “sharing” of money to be given to you. Good luck with that. See your still on that “sharing” vibe.

Workers have to share the wealth they produce with capitalists who produce nothing - conservatives just consistently go up to bat for the aristocracy, as they always have throughout the centuries.  > But feel free to slander conservatives.

">I'll even go so far as to say people can be greedy as easily as they can be cruel.  I'm not saying they ""can be"" greedy and cruel - of course they *can* be.

Democrats aren't challenging billionaires and the systems that protect capital.   ""The most pro-union President"" in my lifetime was objectively Joe Biden, and his pro-labor chops were utterly laughable given the degree of class division we have in this country *by design* - Democrats AND Republicans have worked tirelessly to ensure the working class stays divided and does not present a united front against the capital-owning elites.  > We did just 4 months ago come out of a time where the left had all kinds of power to change a great many things.

Unfortunately, that isn't a winning campaign slogan, and that's why they lose - Democrats do best when they offer the voters something, and they (just like the Republicans) don't want to piss off their corporate masters because they, as all conservatives, have fealty to the aristocracy.  >They certainly didn't care at all about the mentally illl on the streets.nor the rising crime.

On the whole, [crime has been on a steady decline for going on two, three decades now](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/) (barring a small spike in 2020 *gosh I wonder what might've been happening in the world to precipitate that*), and [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6241529/) after [study](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-do-illegal-immigrants-have-low-crime-rate-twelve-possible-explanations) after [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014704117) indicates that migrants commit less crime than the native-born population.   So right out the gate, your thesis rests on a lie - but that's okay, that's expected from conservatives.  And then you continue to bullshit about ""the mentally ill"", as if Republicans have done *anything* on that front at any point in the last *six* decades - other than Reagan shutting down the mental institutions. Which, honestly, was probably one of his better moves as mental institutions were places of horrific abuses - except that he ONLY shut them down, and put in place nothing to replace them, because doing so would cost the government money, and spending money to help people is something Republicans would never, ever do.  But, I don't expect data to sway a conservative's opinion - if conservatives were capable of reason, they wouldn't be conservatives.  >The healthcare system (apart from the very broken mental healthcare) is twisted for sure. there is no argument from me.

">You continue to not actually understand the information you're relying on. Charging rates aren't the same thing as the actual rate of crimes. Just to pick one stat, people are five times more likely to be murdered in the United States than in the United Kingdom. A murder still happens regardless of if they charge someone for it. The only way those articles are a valid rebuttal is if you think that there are something in the neighbourhood of *2700* unreported murders in the UK every year. That is just facially impossible.   >So answer the question. If guns make you safer, why is the rate of violent crime so much higher in the US?

"You should maybe do some deeper research, and stop cherry picking stats that favour your position. It'd make your points more coherent.

You can just move on to the next cherry picked stat rather than consider that you might be wrong.   Britian has always had less gun crime than the US. Last year the UK had *22* firearms murders, and 680 murders in total. The US averages that less than every two weeks: even per capita the murder rate in the US was five times the UK's. And the overall level of violent crime in the UK remains about a quarter per capita than the US. The statement about London having more violent crime than New York is really more about how the image of New York as a dangerous, grimy place is like fifty years out of date. New York City is 81st by murder rate in the US: you're more likely to be killed in Des Moines, Iowa than you are in New York City, and by a fairly significant margin (3.39/100,000 vs 12.63/100,000).

You've consistently posted without demonstrating more than a superficial understanding of what the stats in question actually mean. Here's the rest of the section you snipped the first three sentences out of:  >  35.  Homicide statistics too vary widely. In some developing countries, the statistics are known to be far from complete. Figures for crimes labelled as homicide in various countries are simply not comparable. Since 1967, homicide figures for England and Wales have been adjusted to exclude any cases which do not result in conviction, or where the person is not prosecuted on grounds of self defence or otherwise. This reduces the apparent number of homicides by between 13 per cent and 15 per cent. The adjustment is made only in respect of figures shown in one part of the Annual Criminal Statistics. In another part relating to the use of firearms, no adjustment is made. A table of the number of homicides in which firearms were used in England and Wales will therefore differ according to which section of the annual statistics was used as its base. Similarly in statistics relating to the use of firearms, a homicide will be recorded where the firearm was used as a blunt instrument, but in the specific homicide statistics, that case will be shown under ""blunt instrument"".  What this means is not 'any death that doesn't result in a murder conviction isn't recorded as a murder'. What it means is that cases where the perpetrator is determined to have not actually have legally *murdered* someone are not counted as murder, such as in the case of lawful self-defense. This results in an undercount of 12-15% compared to some other jurisdictions. Let's take that 15% high estimate as read. This would bump the reported murders in 2024 in the UK from 684 to 786, an increase of 102 (less than the two day average in the US over the same period!). Determining that as the rate of murders per 100,000 people, that would increase the reported murder rate of the UK from 1.14 to... 1.1*5*. Still less than a fifth of the US murder rate in the same year.   And even if we take it as read that police agencies are fudging their stats by orders of magnitude: *so are US police forces*, so that would mean that the US murder rate is also under reported.

People in black communities were willing to do what was necessary to protect fellow blacks who are risking their lives by speaking out against and actively challenging the status quo; the willingness of some to take armed defensive action enabled the civil rights movement to sustain itself during the mid-20th Century.    **This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed, How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible,** Charles E.

After the gun bans violent crime soared.  The UK's previously unarmed police force had to rely on armed officers for their own safety.   3. Police have been caught undercounting crime data repeatedly since the Gun Ban.  “An accompanying report from Her  Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary  (HMIC) will confirm that current variations in police methods of recording crime mean the actual crime rates could be 20% higher than official figures in some regions.  Statistics published two weeks ago showed crime is rising in England and Wales, with a sharp increase in violent crime.”   BBC, **Crime rate 'could be 20% higher'** 7/31/2000.

"You are factually incorrect that violent crime is higher in the UK than the US: by almost any count excepting rape the US is around four times higher, and as mentioned earlier the higher rate of rapes is largely down to an active effort to encourage victims to come forward resulting in a more accurate rate than the US. You also continue to cite data that is decades old as if it has a meaningful bearing on modern trends. Violent crime rates in the UK peaked in 1995 and have trended downward since. There's a reason why you have to reach 25 years in the past to find news reporting on high crime rates in the UK.  https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingjune2024  And said high crime rates are still only relative to the UK's crime rate: increasing the 2024 murder rate of 1.15 to 2.3, for instance, would be a 100% increase in the murder rate but would *still* be less than half the murder rate of the US. Just because something increases by a seemingly large number doesn't actually mean it's worse. To take another example, if you had a city with 1 murder in 2024 and 2 murders in 2025, and a city with 100 murders in 2024 and 110 murders in 2025, you could express that statistically as a 100% increase in murders in the first city and a 10% increase in murders in the second. But there were more additional murders in the second city despite the lower increase in rate.  This is all part and parcel of the fact that you fundamentally don't actually seem to understand the what a crime rate actually means, and how to compare them. You keep posting old news stories about 'skyrocketing crime' without understanding how to actually look at what the increases mean in real terms. You then pick your pet ideological explanation and ignore any other possible reading, because rather than looking at the data, understanding it and forming a conclusion, you've started from the conclusion that 'access to guns makes people safer' and then set out to find things that support that conclusion.  Which is why you still haven't meaningfully answered the question at the root of all of this. There are more guns in the United States than in the UK, and there basically always have been. If a more armed society is a safer one, then the US should have less violent crime than the UK on a per capita basis. There is a world where the US could have more murders in absolute terms than the UK but have a lower murder rate, just due to the difference in population, yes. If the US had 3000 murders a year, for instance, it would have a murder rate of 0.88 per 100,000 despite having almost five times as many murders in absolute terms. But it doesn't, because stats mean things, and we can use them to compare populations. The fact that despite being substantially more freely armed and having much larger parts of the country where people are allowed to walk around armed, the US none the less has a substantially higher rate of violent crime than the UK. If an armed society leads to one with less crime, *why does the more armed society have more crime*?   You've never actually answered this: you're either willfully ignorant or you just can't get your head around what the statistics you're pulling actually are demonstrating and how to actually analyze crime rate data. The best you can do is handwave towards police underreporting crimes, which a) would also distort US crime statistics and b) have meaningful estimated bounds on their impact that would *still* result in a lower crime rate than what the US reports in comparable categories. You could increase most UK violent crime rates by 100% and still be less than half the US rates.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-12T12:19:12,2
