She’s high risk which can equal long term gain or long term misery. The one thing I will give props on is that she’s honest about her positions and doesn’t sell the American people a bunch of snake oil right before the election.,Nectarine-Fast,2025-04-25T02:03:29,35
"Senator Kennedy said it best. ""She is the reason we put directions on shampoo bottles. The plan for dealing with her is called operation: let her speak.""",philthy069,2025-04-25T06:12:09,10
Imagine the debates between her and Vance. She being one of the dumbest humans on the planet and he being one of the smartest.,PunsRTonsOfFun,2025-04-24T22:53:14,4
"That would be fun to watch, and a total wipeout for her and the Dems.  It would probably assure GOP rule for decades, that is if Biden/Harris hasn’t already done that.",mdws1977,2025-04-24T22:12:24,0

"Nah, I doubt it. I'm not saying women can't or will never be President but I do think that being president is intertwined in many heads with being a man.   The program you run on doesn't even matter.   My hot take is that we gonna have the first female president when the boomers start kicking the bucket.  And I think the dems realised that after two failed attempts by now.",GamnlingSabre,2025-04-25T01:42:21,0
