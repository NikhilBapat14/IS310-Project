I cannot understand why the Trump administration does not go after Soros funded DAs. This is CLEARLY foreign influence in the American justice system. How is this any different if Putin or any other wealthy oligarch blatantly were trying to influence our system? What is the roadblock? This has to be illegal.,Flare4roach,2025-04-25T08:16:45,57
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty — who has financial ties to George Soros — is facing backlash for not charging 33-year-old Minnesota state government employee Dylan Bryan Adams after he admitted to attacking six Tesla vehicles in a politically motivated vandalism spree last month.  What are you thinking Ms. Moriarty?,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T08:00:54,32

I just covered this story from the NY Post over @ r/LiberalConsequences.  It absolutely reeks of prosecutorial discretion abuse. Where is the ACLU to swoop in on this one. Democrats only care about cutting people a break when it suits their purposes.,According-Activity87,2025-04-25T09:27:21,15

"The roadblock is that the system is corrupt to the very core at this point. Look how he can't even deport gang members without endless obstruction. Do you think democrats would ever convict their own even with 100% proof they were guilty? DC couldnt even convict the fall guy for the illegal spying on Trump's campaign - they had hard proof he took an email and explicitly removed the exculpatory information from it in order to lie to the courts and get a warrant. Even with that hard proof the democrat jury said not guilty. No democrat can be convicted because in any of these cases there will be at least some democrats on the jury and they will never convict their own. There is no republican DC or Manhatten venue here to hold these people accountable, and even if there was they have friends in the courts who would protect them.",day25,2025-04-25T17:29:38,12
