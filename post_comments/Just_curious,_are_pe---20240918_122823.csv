"I have profound hearing loss. I get my news from the BBC, NPR,  and the NYT. Some get theirs from Facebook or Twitter. I'd suggest that the person's choice of news source might be a better predictor of future voting behavior than is their level of hearing loss.",Outrageous-Intern278,2024-09-19T11:09:51,12

This year, [his nephew says](https://time.com/7002003/donald-trump-disabled-americans-all-in-the-family/) that he said ""The shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.""

"I feel like the issue OP is asking about is that the thread of Trump's speeches is so hard to follow in print sometimes that it can look like the captions are having problems, like they're not accurate - and so are people who rely on captions more likely to disregard the nonsense?   I feel like that may have happened more in the first cycle he ran, but it's pretty well established now what his style is, so most people know what to expect going in.   And also yeah, the constant othering can't help.",theRuathan,2024-09-19T05:59:50,3

"True study done by Purdue University School Journalism several years ago. Fox viewers least informed and ""knew"" more things that weren't so than any other. Winner was the NPR listener.  They do seem(to me) to have a liberal bias, but it's lite and their journalism is always factual.  I've noticed that smart conservative political editorialists don't seem to follow them either. Fox is propaganda for the hoi polloi. The left has MSNBC. Altho they beat out Fox in the study (they apparently don't make things up), they really are openly biased.",Outrageous-Intern278,2024-10-22T15:46:05,1

She talks like a politician and doesn't commit to many details but she also seems pretty coherent.   She speaks in public a lot through her life I am sure she has had her moments, but I seems like ""Kamala=Word Salad"" is an unearned reputation, honestly.",thebigmanhastherock,2024-09-19T17:52:39,23
"I’m not sure you know what “word salad” means. Do you have some links or transcripts of examples, perhaps?  THIS is word salad. This was trump’s answer when he was asked about his plan for child care:  >But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I’m talking about — that, because look, child care is child care, couldn’t — you know, there’s something — you have to have it in this country. You have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers, compared to the kind of numbers that I’m talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they’re not used to. But they’ll get used to it very quickly. And it’s not going to stop them from doing business with us. But they’ll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we’re talking about, including child care, that it’s going to take care. We’re going to have — I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country.",CapOnFoam,2024-09-23T16:24:35,5

"Part of determining who is best for the future is listening to what they say.  Even if, like Donald Trump, they don't actually stand by half the things they say, it's still important.  We're talking about electing a head of state, the representative of the American people to the rest of the globe.  That person's words alone will have incredible power across the world, so it's very important that the things he says actually represent us well.  Also, if someone making fun of a journalists disability and saying ""...those kinds of people should just die."" isn't considered an indicator of poor character, then what is?",Calladit,2024-09-20T11:38:57,2

"I listen to everything he says, and he is without a doubt the person who’s best for the future of Our Country! I don’t know what kind of America you want, but if it’s anything close to what’s going on in this Country today, and our standing in the rest of the world, we’ll soon no longer be the UNITED STATES of AMERICA!  I listen to everything Trump says, and Kamala as well… And who is Kamala Harris? She has no idea what she’s taking about, can she be anymore vague or less detailed about her plans? And she is caught in one lie after another lie, even though nobody actually fact checks her… And she has changed her stance on just about every Political position that she’s ever Supported & Voted for her entire Political career! And when does she change them… ? Two months before the Election, to pass herself off as some Moderate??? So that she can get everyone’s vote? There’s nothing about her that’s even remotely close to Moderate… And there are 100’s of Tapes & Voting Records to prove it! Her actions speak MUCH LOUDER than her hollow words! Maybe You can believe her, I though DO NOT… Not for a second!   Does Trump say stupid things sometimes, absolutely… And honestly, I never even like the guy, before he became President. But that all changed once he did become President!  And as far as stupid things people say… So do the Politicians on the Left, along with the Liberal Media. And They’ve said some of the most disgusting and abhorrent things I’ve heard from anybody in my life! And The things that they say are 100 times worse than anything that Trump has said! Just the things said to me and my wife the last 8 years, is nothing I’ve ever heard before! So I have no problem with what Trump has to say… Especially considering the 24/7 attacks he’s had to endure on him and his family! I have absolutely ZERO respect for the Liberal Media, which I used to watch all the time! And Trump does represent America and the American people, way more so than the REAL Kamala Harris… Joe Biden was also supposed to be Moderate Joe, and once he got into Office, he was anything but Moderate! Although he didn’t know it… He wasn’t running the Country… And with his dementia, I don’t even think he knew that!  This Country is a complete disaster right now, and we were without a shadow of a doubt, WAY MUCH BETTER OFF 4 years ago, than we are today! ….

"I have no clue what tfg means… lol  Trumps Tax Cuts, and his Economic Policies helped everyone! On a percentage basis, it helped the lower & middle class the most. His economic plans for his 2nd term will do the same.   Kamala’s plan to Tax everyone, doesn’t help anybody! And she lied about everyone saying that her Tax Plan would benefit the Country (16 Nobel Laureates…??? haha), and Trumps would cause massive Inflation, and then a Recession within 6 months... Just ridiculous! Anyone who actually believes that, doesn’t understand economics.   And it’s funny that Goldman Sachs came out IMMEDIATELY,  when she mentioned them endorsing her Economic Plan over Trumps, and said they did not endorse her plan, and have no opinion on either… Maybe because GS, who are extremely Liberal, and huge donors to the Democratic Party, said in 2016 that Trumps Plan would be bad for America, and even worse for the rest of the World! Well, the exact opposite happened, so O don’t think they want to embarrass themselves again! Yet Kamala still lies about GS supporting her Economic Plan… She doesn’t even understand what her plan is! Her first time Home Buyer’s Plan, has gone from a $25,000 Down Payment, to a $25,000 Tax Credit, to now a $25,000 Tax Deduction… haha  Well, which one is it Kamala? They’re 3 completely different things!",lookn2com4tu,2024-09-23T00:33:17,-1

"Genuine question: are you prolife and could you ever see yourself voting prochoice?   I ask because I see so many people around me for which that is the only topic that matters to them, but they twist truly bizarre narratives against Kamala to justify their vote without just saying it was really just about abortion. They make these projecting arguments where they assign her all the negative features of their own candidate (e. g., ""she tells lie after lie"" or ""she's a criminal"") completely unironically, and it's obvious they believe what they are saying.

"Yeah, a two party system. Which they are trying to change. And if they succeed, they’d easily hold 75% of both senate and congress.

Except they are trying to allow that too. That’s why they voted against the SAVE act right? Why vote against proving you’re a citizens before voting. It’s already illegal, sure, but so is crossing the border illegally and it seems that legality isn’t working so well. It’s also why there was 11,000 illegal immigrants registered to vote in Virginia. 200 in Arizona, 600 in NJ. Why are they being registered to vote?",danksc268,2024-10-08T22:58:19,0
"Genuine Answer: I’m Pro Life, not Pro Death! The only time I’m accepting of an abortion is if the sex was not consensual (ie: Rape or Incest), the Life of the Mother is at stake, or the baby is deformed with severe physical & medical issues where life would not be possible or sustainable… Then the woman has a choice to terminate.   I’ve seen babies in the womb, they are ALIVE, moving around and growing, and already developing a personality… I’ve also seen an abortion, where that child is fighting for its Life, and scared to death! For a woman to say that that baby is HER BODY, is not only completely disconnected, heartless, apathetic and selfishly incompassionate, it’s Neanderthal thinking… There’s nothing compassionately human about it! That’s no different than taking a live baby and just throwing it in the garbage! Just get rid of it, is the mentality.  Abortions today, have become nothing more than a form of Birth Control… We’ve become an immoral society, where children are engaging in sex at 13-14 years old…, and that’s ACCEPTABLE! There’s a responsibility that comes with sex, and it’s the possibility of creating another life. If you do engage in sex, accept that responsibility… If you don’t want to get pregnant, be responsible… And if you do so, and in the rare occasions you do get pregnant, give that child up for adoption. There are MILLIONS of Families that can’t have children, and want one more than anything in the world… Give that child a chance to have a life, and those Married Couples a chance to have a Family. In some communities, there are actually just as many abortions as there are births… That’s just incomprehensible! And tells you how far off track we’ve gotten as a Society!   My mother was pregnant with me in High School… Thank god abortion wasn’t really an option back then, like it is now. Now it’s almost becoming more the norm, than the exception… If abortion then, was as acceptable and the norm like it is now, I may never have had the chance to live! So I’m fighting for those children’s rights to live, and have a life to enjoy!  My Wife was one of those who was given a life, and put up for adoption. I thank god everyday, that her mother made that decision, and gave her the opportunity of life! And there are 1000’s around her who if they knew, would feel the same!  And I’m tired of hearing that it’s a woman’s body… No, it’s not your body, it’s the baby’s body… It’s not your life, it’s that babies life you’re taking away! You weren’t born with that baby in your body, so it’s not your body!",lookn2com4tu,2024-09-24T15:13:22,1

"Thank you for your response. I understand where you are coming from, but I disagree with your conclusion; I am prochoice. But I know I could not change your opinion on this topic, so I won't try.   But what I will try is to maybe get you to consider that you can think Harris is someone you would never vote for because of this topic, but that she can also be a competent and intelligent and honest leader? In all seriousness, the previous reasons you have against her (vague on policy, lies, wishy-washy on positions) boggles my mind and, I assume, other liberals because these are some of the traits we see in Trump. My own mother will give me reasons she hates Harris, but again, they all seem to be projections of Trump's faults onto Harris, and I know the real reason she hates Harris is because of abortion.   I guess I'm just (rhetorically) wondering if the rose colored glasses would come off about Trump if he suddenly was prochoice (which he has declared himself to be in the past and recently implied it when he said FL's law didn't allow enough time at 6 weeks).   In my opinion, Trump is a selfish man-child. But I can't fault someone who recognizes that but still votes for him if they consider abortion the most important topic. I just don't understand the people that don't recognize his character.",MegaRadCool8,2024-09-24T15:39:56,1
