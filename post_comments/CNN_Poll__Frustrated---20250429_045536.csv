"I've definitely heard the argument from people who voted trump that he can't do the crazy stuff he says because of checks and balances. Even if that were true, why the fuck would you want a leader that needs to constantly be blocked and reined in to keep him from going dictator? That's inherently a bad leader, with or without those checks and balances. ",Moustached92,2025-04-29T08:40:58,687

"This just indicates that a large portion of the country are simply reactionary to whatever is going on at any given time.   You don’t get to punish the democrats at the ballot over Biden or Kamala or Gaza or inflation yesterday, and then complain that they’re not doing enough to fight the republicans today.   You didn’t.   Give them.   The votes.   In congress.   If you give the republicans a majority, they will claim a mandate, no matter how thin that majority is. Every time. They will take that as permission to do whatever the fuck they want. Every time. All the democrats can do is engage in some mostly symbolic gesture of protest, or filibuster. That’s it. That’s the amount of power they’ve been given by the voters. Not very much.   Upset that they’re ineffective opposition right now? Well tough shit. What do people think it means when they hand the republicans a trifecta?

Look at Biden's previous admin and you KNOW this to be true: in one of the most contentious political environments Biden got an immense amount of things done while Republicans can only ever pass tax cuts with a majority and let Trump run buck-wild.   Democrats could be further criticized for not prosecuting Trump hard enough to make him face consequences faster which is, again, a valid criticism- but again we aren't Trump- we can't throw Supreme Court justices in a gulag because their decisions betray the country. We can't just  lead endless investigations of Conservatives while being pressured in a completely lop-sided media environment (of which you are contributing to **DIRECTLY**).

When democrats controlled both chambers, Biden actually got useful legislation passed. The republicans of Obama blocking everything wasn’t able to do the same with Biden.   As for “stonewalling” executive orders. The only way (outside of passing new legislation) is to sue the executive branch. Which IS happening.

I always vote Dem because my life and the life of my family literally depends on it.  >By any reasonable metric she’s still a million times a better candidate than Trump  What metrics are these? To be clear, I think she's would *absolutely* be a better president than Trump. By a million miles. But what ***candidate*** metrics would you say she was stronger under? I would say my top metrics for what makes a strong candidate are:  1. Won the primary 2. Charismatic speaker 3. Anti-establishment messaging--specifically, the ability to criticize the status quo while selling Americans on a better vision 4. Basic political instincts. Some overlap with the above. Harder to quantify, but what to say when, how to cater to various groups, how to command attention.  Trump beats her easily in all four of those. Harris lost the 2020 primaries so hard I assumed I'd never see her on the national stage again. Saw her speak live and it was dreadful. Trump is a B-list reality TV host. He's not *that* charismatic and would get destroyed by a Bill Clinton type, but he knows showmanship and has Harris licked here. And Harris was tied at the hip to Biden (""no sunlight between us"" was the official stance Biden forced her to take, yes it was messy), utterly unwilling to criticize the status quo in any meaningful way. She didn't even try to articulate a meaningful change-oriented vision for America. Trump's vision was meaningless and gibberish once you looked closer, but he sure loved articulating it. And her responses showed *really* weak political instincts, something Harris has been rightly criticized on over the years imo. God, that answer on The View.  I've been reading that Jonathan Allan book on the Biden->Harris transition and it's...deeply depressing reading. Highly recommend for anyone here who hasn't recognized that our party is in a clown car and the wheels came off years ago, if not decades.  As a candidate, Trump's not *that* strong. I'd gut check him as maybe a 5/10. A Barack Obama or Bill Clinton would tear him apart, and a JFK would make a mockery of the whole race. There are absolutely Dems who could beat him.

"My issue is that it never seems to go the other way. My first presidential election was in 2020, and I live in one of the counties that flipped for Biden in Georgia. I remember the energy and what it was for. I remember people staying home from school because someone threatened a mass shooting. I remember walking with a whole lot of people protesting police violence.   Biden’s response to the massive BLM movement was “We need to FUND the police, not defund the police!” I don’t remember Biden doing a damn thing about gun violence. He attempted a lot of important things, but it either got stopped by the Republicans, party moderates, or the Senate Parliamentarian for some reason. The left got frustrated with the lack of results, and rather than push harder to get those results Biden and Harris pushed right. They ignored or outright attacked people opposing Israel’s war in Gaza. Kamala talked about how America should have “the world’s deadliest fighting force” and brought out Liz Cheney for campaign events.   I hate the narrative that it was the left’s fault for Harris’ loss. The strategy they went for was abandoning the issues that people voted for Biden on (gun control, economic reform, police reform, etc.) and the issues that arose under his administration (abortion, attacks on trans rights, economic concerns, court reform, etc.) in favor of moderate Republican talking points. I’m one of the young voters who made sure Biden won in Georgia, and I didn’t get ads about core party issues. I got ads about how the Biden-Harris admin was good on the economy when at the time it really wasn’t.   Every time the right experienced a loss since W. Bush they LEAPED to the extreme. Two or three Republicans stayed behind ideologically, but no Republicans have even tiptoed towards the center. Their understanding has been that rallying the party around more extreme rhetoric is going to excite people and win them more voters than attempting to win the middle, and they’ve repeatedly won with that strategy. When Dems saw success it was their base rallying around backlash towards right-wing dominance or core issues. 2018 and 2020 it was backlash against Trump, and in 2022 they held on due to rallying around abortion rights. I don’t think Democrats switched to Republicans (indicating we wanted them over Dems) I think Dems stayed home.

">But her being unqualified as a candidate because she lost in the primaries the previous election isn't as disqualifying as trump being a felon and insurrectionist.  Evidently not. Because primaries are about likelihood to win. Trump's been a known criminal for about the last \~50 years. Didn't stop him from winning 2016, I don't know why anyone thought it would make a huge difference for 2024 when he was running a strong anti-establishment campaign Dems were playing into. Heck, I'm not certain our accusations hurt him more than helped.  Remember, the pornstar stuff came was revving up when the Biden age discussion was happening. This was the rare case that a sex scandal might've helped because it made Trump seem more youthful by contrast. ""He can still have sex scandals? Wow, he's so much healthier than Biden!""  We don't--or shouldn't--assess someone's candidacy based on how much moral merit we think they have. It's about likelihood to win.  >she is still a more qualified candidate by every metric when compared to trump.  Really? Well, here are some metrics.  * Trump Primaries: 3/3 * Harris Primaries: 0/1, 0/2 if you count skipping 2024. * Trump Years of Professional Showman Experience: 14 (assuming he was on all Apprentice seasons--I didn't watch to check) * Harris equivalent: 0. And it showed.  I think he beat her on a *lot* of intangibles too. Obama and Pelosi were famously against Harris's candidacy because of her weakness and bad political instincts. I would say we saw said instincts on full display. Trump, may he rot in hell, actually has dangerously good political instincts. He was a professional salesman, so that kinda tracks.  Harris had probably the worst campaign slogan I've ever seen too, which again reinforces the instincts thing. Her main slogan was either ""when we fight, we win"" (ugh) or ""not going back"". The former is an awful slogan because it's not remotely descriptive and also she didn't really fight. The latter is a campaign suicide attempt. Because Harris was running heavily on going-back Obama nostalgia, pre-Trump, and pre-Covid nostalgia, while Trump was running on pre-globalization nostalgia. The entire 2024 campaign was about how we all wanted to go back. It also screamed she was out of touch and only cared about social issues, because people are so economically nostalgic for better times and the only front that's really improved over the last few decades is social.",Sminahin,2025-04-29T14:56:02,-1
"Completely see you here. I would *also* say this is a way that we politically-engaged types are very different from low-political-engagement types. Quick backstory, I went to school for electoral studies and campaign work. I had such a great time as Obama campaign staff that I wanted to devote my life to doing that over and over again, helping our party win back America. God, 2008-2010 was such a time of promise that it feels naive in hindisght.  The hardest thing for most people I've seen in politics is not losing sight of how low-political-engagement types behave. This is a horrible trap, because the more we learn about politics, the easier it is to lose sight here. And we also surround ourselves with other high-political types, essentially creating these political-awareness-as-classism blinders.  People like us? We engage these candidates totally differently. We contextualize everything within a political meta, we frame candidates in terms of their achievements, etc... This makes us unusual. A far larger share of the electorate--at least the share we're competing for--takes things far more at face value. We care about resumes and CVs. They don't at all (beyond how they can package it in a one-sentence narrative) and refocus all that towards what the person onscreen is saying to them.  So when Harris's vision for America was framed in very tame, incrementalistic, status-quo-friendly terms and didn't acknowledge the many economic problems in America right now (Biden's fault, but also hers for letting Biden control her campaign messaging), you and I thought things like ""well, she can't afford to blast her former boss"" or ""she can't afford to overdeliver, so she had to keep her statements mild"" or ""she'd be lambasted as a socialist if she said anything strong."" We temper our expectations for our candidate along these lines and judge them not for what's onscreen at a moment-to-moment basis, but how they incorporate into the context. This is not how much of the electorate behaves.  All the things we use to bolster her strengths, to mitigate her downsides? It depends on that meta-engagement level beyond what's onscreen at that moment. Trump is a deeply uncomplicated man who has much more success in those moment-to-moment arenas. He came out of reality television, commanding no-context minute-to-minute attention is the only job he's ever been good at in his life.  Imo this disconnect is a huge driver behind our branding issues--""authenticity"" is a major keyword here. Our leadership and its chosen candidates have completely forgotten how to engage outside the cerebral, political-gamesmanship-knowledge-assumed level. Bill Clinton knew. Obama knew. Gore, Kerry, Hillary, Biden (he maybe had it once but it faded), and Harris did not. And it's producing these candidates who are consistently misaligned with the electorate.",Sminahin,2025-04-29T12:59:45,2

We've been *really* bad about it since the late 20th and whole 21st century, imo. We've utterly lost sight with the anti-establishment causes that fueled us.  This is especially a problem because modern America, by and large, *hates* the status quo. I mostly blame Reagan. Which means both parties should be trotting out their respective versions of anti-establishment messaging if they want to survive. Republicans did. We didn't. This is part of why Republicans are acting like they're a minority party even when they're in power--because they're fighting against the system, not just us. This is also a large part of why Dem messaging that just frames us as opposition to Republicans doesn't work.

"Exactly, especially this.  >The last Democrat to draw mass support was Obama, because he was seen as an insurgent, radical force who was breaking through the democratic establishment to seize the nomination.  Heck, let's take it further. For almost 100 years, our winners have been: JFK, Carter, Bill Clinton, Obama. I don't have it in me to call Biden a winner, please don't make me do it.  All four of those candidates ran on extremely anti-establishment vibes. JFK with his bad-boy imagery. Carter was a southern governor who ran on a change message. Clinton was a southern governor who ran on a change message. Obama famously ran against the party in Chicago and then again in the primaries--Midwesterner beating the coastal establishment.  The popular Dems since? Bernie and AOC. It's almost like there's a theme in what Americans have *always* wanted, but our party is obsessively trying to gaslight us that elderly DC bureaucrats who speak in politicianese while defending the status quo are super hip right now.  Clinton beat Bush as an anti-establishment challenger. Gore was hyper-establishment and that's how Bush beat him. Kerry and Edwards were two ultrarich East Coast lawyers turned Washington Insiders, some of the only candidates a sitting president nepokid could look anti-establishment against. Barack Obama beat Hillary when she was seen as the avatar of the establishment. McCain knew he had to get anti-establishment cred to have a chance against Obama, which is why he chose Palin and leaned into the ""maverick"" messaging. Romney...was such a mistake. A vulture capitalist stereotype right after the financial crash was one of the only people who could make a sitting president look anti-establishment. Trump tore the Republican primaries apart with anti-establishment messaging, and it's how he beat Hillary. Covid forced Biden to accidentally run against the current establishment in a meaningful way, which is the only reason he won. And Harris...oof, sending her off as Biden's pro-establishment successor was like sending a lamb to the slaughter.

"I was Obama campaign staff in 2008. I remember full well. The party massively threw its weight behind Hillary and we won *against* the party. The party absolutely meddled here for the worse, it was just against a strong enough candidate to save us from ourselves.  2016, I actually hold a different view than most assume when I say that. I think the party's clear favoritism of Hillary for decades straight cleared the field, making people reluctant to run against her. It also falsely built her up as a strong candidate when she was ridiculously weak. Not only did this deprive us of potentially better candidates in that cycle, it also starved up-and-comers of spotlights they could use to build their profile in the party. I *also* think Biden 2016 was better than Hillary 2016 and that we shouldn't have encouraged him to step down for her, though I didn't like either. My personal choice for 2016 was Warren, btw--I didn't think she was that strong and we hopefully would've had a better option in a Hillary-free election. Hillary frankly was pretty disqualified as a candidate in 2016 and it's embarassing that she didn't have the good sense to step down, it's twice as embarrassing that people in the party thought she was a good choice and threw their weight behind her.  2020 I think was an absolute dumpster fire, the product of decades of Dem dysfunction, gerontocracy, and weakness. We had no stand-out candidates and I blame a lot of that on the accumulated policies suppressing fresher voices in the Dem party for *decades*. Imo, Clyburn is most responsible for Biden's presidency and I don't know if Clyburn has made a single good decision in the 21st century. I view 2020 as the least meddled of recent primaries, but also as strong evidence that our party's guidance has led to serious logistical issues around the primary.

Aka, we would have had to unleash our own horrific craziness on the rest of the country, which would have been an incredible wedge that cemented moderate/independent votes for GOP leadership for at least the next couple terms....unless you're suggesting that Biden should have taken over elections and put the military everywhere etc etc etc.?   There's no world where that would have had a net benefit, because it would have simply led to fully justify, motivate, and radicalize millions of voters to see the Democrats as evil. That's not how we make lasting change or build a better future either. It's just the opposite side of the authoritarian coin.  This time around though? Since January? There's **already** justification for a future president to do all of that this time. Will it be pretty getting there or in any way not problematic if that future president DeMAGAfies the country afterwards? Fuck no. But now? We DO have a clear and present danger and it's become undeniable. We DO have a well documented and terrible laundry list of acts proving why many of these folks need to be prosecuted for going against the Constitution and America sovereign interests, and undoubtedly we DO have some treason charges readily available and nearly indefensible waiting for those in this administration who committed espionage or other egregious crimes against the country.  So, to your point in some ways - if we find a way out of this back to rational (i.e., Democratic or progressive-leaning Independent) leadership....decisive, ugly action will need to be taken to prevent things from devolving further. Breaking up their propaganda networks, mandating and protecting actual journalistic integrity and truth, stacking SCOTUS with at least 4 more justices, and any other related items are on the table and have to be viewed not as policies but as protections for the country and the people. And they need to do all of that right away while everyone is still reeling from whatever horrors Trump is inevitably gonna try to pull on his way out (one way or another). If they wait too long (see Jan 6), they risk the nonvoters falling back to sleep and the MAGOP organizing and creating a full blown mess.    All of this is to say - politics and, specifically, governing 350 million people is fucking hard. Doing things illegally or without sufficient justification and evidence is folly, as it guarantees a major rift will form in the country (see right now). The only way to do things fast is with actual justification to do so. Democrats taking more aggressive, extralegal actions prior to being able to justify and inspire the country at large that it was necessary and the only option they had left to take would only lead to further escalation and polarization while damaging their future electability.   So the time to act outside the law to protect us all couldn't have been before unfortunately. But what comes next is gonna require some hard, ugly, comprehensive planning and decisions to be made and for the punishments to be very publicized and coded into our laws with every lever of power available. Otherwise, we're gonna live in this cycle until someone else crazy eventually finishes the job Trump is currently in the middle of starting.",ice_9_eci,2025-04-29T09:23:51,4

"I intentionally left out the Dem VPs who inherited from a dead president. I think it makes for a fundamentally different candidate dynamic that essentially lets us cheat less electable people into office where they can *then* use the incumbency advantage if their presidency goes well. I...honestly find it more helpful to separate them out entirely when doing any electoral analysis.  And also because I didn't have the energy to go back that far.  But fantastic writeup, because I strongly believe these themes are deep-baked into Americana, but I'm always hesitant of overreach (and of giving myself too much voluntary homework in defending the claim) by pushing the timeframe back too far. As someone who worked '08, have to defend Obama--he wasn't a *complete* blank slate. His big priority was housing reform and a lot of us loved him for that. It was the first goal he had to discard. Rip. Kinda symbolic of our whole party.  >Clinton was just too long in the tooth with a quarter century of hard decisions, right wing smears, and scandals to turn off various voters.  I don't think you can dismiss the Kissinger bits. Openly bragging about your close personal association with Kissinger while running for the Dem ticket is a **bold** move, one that I think speaks to her awful political instincts. And weak morality. And racism. And poor understanding of political history. And arrogance. And intellectual vapidity.  Clinton had been hated by both the right *and* much of the left for quite some time. And some of it for good reason. If you genderswapped her, she looks an awful lot like a worse Jeb Bush to me in many ways.  Also, most of us under-50 Dem loyalists grew up hearing about how Reagan was so old it was unsafe at 77 and that could never happen again. Hillary was running for her first term at 69, exact same age as Reagan. What, does that suddenly not apply to people with a D next to their name?  >If you didn't live through the 90s and 00s it's easy to discredit just how ridiculous (and widespread) so much of the HRC criticism was.

">Bernie and AOC are only “popular” with a very specific subset of Dems.  This was true. This is not true anymore. If you've looked at recent polling at all, people want anti-establishment, labor-oriented fighters. AOC in particular has refocused herself heavily here--and she already put a strong emphasis. They are polling *much* better than they were in previous cycles.  >Hence why Bernie couldn’t win a primary against Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden.  Tbh, I think this is a really shallow analysis that really misses the point. Because Bernie is an incredibly weak candidate. Even in 2016, Bernie should've been unelectable for age reasons (Hillary kinda helped him here by shattering age norms herself), he was from a low-cultural-impact, zero-political-impact Dem state, and he'd self-declared as a socialist.  This man is, conventionally, a **very** weak candidate. And he managed to straight-up brawl the party's best and brightest candidates. You all are so caught up in trying to prove Bernie couldn't have beaten Hillary/Biden that dominates the conversation and you forget to ask the obvious follow-up question: why did such a weak candidate overperform so heavily? If the Dem party had sat back and properly thought about that for a millisecond in 2016, we might have had a Trump-free existence other than giggling about ""that one weird Republican primary in 2016"".  >The US is not as progressive as Reddit would like to believe, sadly.  Tbf, I think this statement is both a problem of lack of political awareness and too much political awareness. People who are hyperpolitical tend to reduce everything to a left vs right axis when honestly...that's one of the least important ways to understand 21st century politics.  Most of the electorate has no clue what left vs right vs progressive even is and us trying to obsessively place them along that axis is more about high-engagement people misunderstanding the political behavior of low-engagement types. A lot of people think Harris is more progressive than Bernie just because they thought he talked sense and she didn't. A lot of people think progressive = social issue focus, but actually agree with economic progressivism. That was my ex-union MAGA family members in the rustbelt. I could probably have sold them on full-blown economic democratic socialism if I gave it conservative branding. There's a strong Bush->Obama->Bernie->Trump/AOC slice of the electorate.  Far more important axis is pro vs anti-establishment, imo. Because people have *hated* the economic status quo probably since Reagan murdered American capitalism. And the more anti-establishment branded candidate has arguably won every single election after 1988. The Dem party has become so hyper-institutionalist in the 21st century that only the progressives balk the party to display anti-establishment, anti-status-quo narratives. *That's* the root of progressive popularity. When someone tries to make it about left vs right, you can tell they're missing the point and out of step with the electorate.

You gave a very good excuse for why our self-inflicted damage from botched Biden handling meant we couldn't do what we clearly should've done under better circumstances. Why on *Earth* would that excuse help with voters who've been wanting a real primary? It's not like our candidate mysteriously died in a freak accident nobody could've planned for and we had to late-pivot. All our dysfunction here was our own fault. 2. Harris never should've been in that spot. Given his age and his strongly implied 1-term presidency (necessary because age), Biden had to pick a strong heir as a VP. He chose an old, low-charisma, Cali lawyer bureaucrat who got nearly last in the 2020 primaries after announcing he was going to choose a black woman. That's...the worst possible way to announce you're choosing the worst candidate, oh god. 3. Harris was extremely unelectable. Biden was about bottom 1% of the general population levels of electability--Will Smith right after the slap was probably more electable than Biden. So Harris was an upgrade. But she wasn't very electable either. And she absolutely needed a primary for legitimacy given her 2020 performance, how Biden introduced her, and her incredibly invisible performance as VP.

">Please make the arguments for how George W Bush, son of president George HW Bush, and former Vice President Joe Biden were anti-establishment  Easily!  George W Bush was running against Al Gore. And then John Kerry/John Edwards.  W was a Texan who hardly ever stepped foot in Washington. He talked like regular folk. His last name +nepobaby status would normally have hurt him...but he was against *Gore*. Gore was a politician's politician. VP heir to the last president, been in Washington so long nobody could remember he was from Tennessee originally, and he spoke in pure politicianese/bureacratenese. To be clear, I like Gore a lot. When things get bleak, I literally daydream about a world in which Gore had won. But he was *such* a Washington stereotype that George W Bush of all people could play the anti-elitist, anti-Washington, anti-establishment card. Gore's debate performance really didn't help here.  And after Bush beat Gore on largely anti-elitism, anti-Washington, anti-coastal sentiment...we ran two ultrarich East Coast lawyers turned Washington insiders named John. I still remember that article about Kerry, something like ""much more charming when you get him alone on his Cape Cod sailboat"". We made it easy for W.  Biden ran on Covid. Covid forced him into what was effectively an anti-establishment critique of Trump's handling of the pandemic. Normally, this wouldn't have worked. But Covid was utterly transformative here. Our party also clearly didn't understand that 2020 was about Covid, which let us play a lot of cards we couldn't normally.",Sminahin,2025-04-29T10:47:14,11

This makes sense on the surface, but our leadership is also completely blind to how bubble-effected they've become, completely out of step with the American public basically the whole 21st century.  So for these leaders, the base and the donors aren't equal and opposite forces. When's the last time Schumer meaningfully talked to a regular person who's not economically comfy? But he talks to his donors *all the time*. Even if the leaders think they're reasonable middlemen here, 99.9% of their exposure is to one side. Even if you've got good intent, that'll derail you.

"I write fast and am actually a writer by trade, so apologies for the length.   Thanks for the reply and polite discourse to start - it's really important and hopefully my frustrations with all of this weren't too snarky or directed at you specifically.    I agree with what you said, but I also think the slow propaganda that the GOP seeped and normalized into the discourse is mostly to blame along with voter apathy/laziness/lack of information. The latter piece is what I've seen the most, as many people aren't following and when you try to get them up to speed at all, the sheer magnitude of what Trump has done—and specifically that he seemingly was allowed to do many things that were previously anathema, and suffered little to no lasting major legal consequences—simply is too much for them to consider. Not because they don't care, but because life is fucking busy and stressful and they have the misplaced faith that democracy is some sacrosanct, indelible truism and the 'way things work'.  So ultimately, I'm just mad. I'm worried. I'm fearful. But I'm also highly aware that constantly denigrating, doubting, and injecting a bothsidesism into the conversation when we're facing a threat as apathetically vindictive as the MAGOP party will NEVER have the desired effect at this political/historical moment.   All that type of discourse does is inspire MAGA (and Russia/Iran/China's bot farmers) to push harder on those division points, and at best you'll decrease faith in *the only viable opposition party we have available to us right now*. That's not to say we don't deserve a true progressive candidate, but right now we need to coalesce around ANYONE that's willing to be the face of opposition to these folks and has the highest chance to win. I don't care if that's Butteigig or Newsome or Bernie or fucking Warren...but I do care that they're on our side, that they and their record can stand up to MAGOP mudslinging, and that they are able to inspire/motivate the hell out of the most folks as possible to vote these rabid weasels out and do any/all of the things I listed in my last post to start the cleanup and send a clear, *Constitutionally-defensible* message to the ones that remain.  Again, none of this is gonna be pretty, but if we keep shouting at each other and pointing fingers internally....that only helps the GOP, and not only does nothing to help us right now...it actively hurts our chances of getting Dem/progressive voters motivated to rip the orange humonculous from the safety of the White House into the public eye to face justice.

"> I think a lot of it had to do with open vs closed primaries.   it has been explained to you multiple times that Sanders lost, and admits he lost, because he failed to attract female and non-white voters while Hillary and Biden spent time and resources doing so. If you cant acknowledge what Bernie Sanders himself says is his main failure then you aren't arguing in good faith. There is no need to cede an argument after Ive disproven every GOP talking point you've attempted to repeat. Seriously google Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams and she talks about how they (Meta and the trump campaign) used Sanders to manipulate voters into non-voting and how easy they found it. I've cited this book at you multiple times and you haven't even acknowledged it. I suspect because then you would have to ask yourself if you have spent the past decade being played by Republicans on social media  > Democratic primaries shouldn’t be closed. What 18 year old has already picked a party AND registered? Not many.  How Dare the democratic party ask Democrats who they want to represent Democrats on the national stage. How dare they make it so easy to sign up they have a literal form with a check box that you can pick up at any government building. And its not like the under 25 voter apathy was a secret. If sanders wanted the under 25 crowd to turn up and vote then maybe he should have invested resources in a get out the vote registration campaign like Biden and Hillary did.  > So essentially yes, Hillary was picked by a largely old and black demographic.  yes, because they were the ones who voted. people over 25, women and non-white voters are essential voting blocks that sanders almost completely ignored. Turns out by courting voters, like Clinton and Biden did, and establishing trust with them, like Clinton and Biden did, you can earn their vote instead of demanding it, like Sanders did.
