"No matter what you think about this decision, you know darn well if it was happening where Trump lived or had a business, it would be a different story!  Snippet:  >For the last 14 years, when it rains in Lowndes County, Alabama, contaminated standing water builds up around Annye Burke’s home. When the septic tank breaks down, raw sewage backs up into her toilet, she said.   >Although “frustrated” by the unhealthy and inconvenient conditions, Burke said she doesn’t let it get her down. Human wastewater contaminating homes and yards in these rural parts of central Alabama “has become a way of life,” she said. The problem has existed so long and was so pervasive that a [2017 study determined](https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/97/5/article-p1623.xml?utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffer20d45&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com) 1 in every 3 adults in the county had the intestinal parasite hookworm.    >The Biden administration investigated and allocated nearly $26 million to rebuild Lowndes County’s water infrastructure, with the Department of Justice declaring the majority-Black area was suffering from “environmental racism.”     >But earlier this month, President Donald Trump [issued an executive order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-01953/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing) to kill the deal, calling it “illegal DEI.”   >The DOJ’s Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights under Trump, [said the agency](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-terminates-environmental-justice-settlement-agreement-advancing-president) “will no longer push ‘environmental justice’ as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. ",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-01T11:35:48,84

"I mean by making this choice the people that voted for Trump have caused lasting and very serious damage to the whole world.   It was a foolish choice and undertaken lightly or with zeal.   Is their accountability?

"I don't need a tissue.  My final point is this: Yes, we both agree that due to those  who voted for Trump,  there is and will be much suffering.  But, once you or anyone else starts to enjoy seeing others suffer, whether they deserve it or not, it spirals into something that you don't want to happen within your soul.
