If we ban the pride flag before the confederate flag… it’ll explain a lot about what the United States really is.,StatBot2,2025-05-05T21:09:52,118
These MAGA fanatics are chipping away at liberty every chance they get. Stopping them really is about preserving the best parts of what the US stands for.,tonyt4nv,2025-05-05T20:44:51,67
"Instead of doing that, why don't they ban Republican politicians from wearing AR-15 pins every time there's a school shooting?",raistlin65,2025-05-05T22:58:54,22
Conservatives were whining just yesterday about banning flags.,LionBig1760,2025-05-06T00:07:48,8
Keep in mind that the Supreme Court has ruled that discrimination against LGBT people is unconstitutional. LGBT acceptance is official US policy.   Republicans banning symbols of the LGBT community is an expression of opposition to the official stance of the United States.  The reason I bring this up is because I think people tend to think of this as just a matter of opinion between the left and the right rather than settled law.   Republicans are treating as if it's not settled and they can ignore the courts if they simply don't like it. Then use that to harass people they don't like.,citizen_x_,2025-05-05T22:52:40,10

"I went to high school in Utah in the late 90s and Pride anything was deemed “gang paraphernalia”. They also banned all of our after school clubs to prevent creation of a Pride club. This is just a 25 year regression, unfortunately.",jim_bones,2025-05-06T07:16:58,2

"When I saw the headline, my first thought was ""I have seen such technically-true-but-intellectually-dishonest headlines before"". So, I wanted to double check before commenting. My concerns have been validated. FTA, with emphasis added:  > In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that **prohibits flags with political viewpoints**, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”  It's weird how the headline focuses on pride flags and not, say, BLM flags.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2025-05-05T22:37:56,-6

"According to the article, both types of flags would be banned from state-owned schools:  > In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags.

">the Supreme Court has ruled that discrimination against LGBT people is unconstitutional  The current SCOTUS, or a prior one? Pretty much _any_ ruling by prior SCOTUSes could potentially be overturned by the current one, who are likely to agree with the opinion that the flying of Pride flags by any government entity discriminates, against people whose faiths are opposed to LGBT+ people, and may even rule that parents have the right to pre-approve all teaching materials and withdraw their child from any class teaching or displaying anything they disagree with.",mittfh,2025-05-06T12:53:53,1
"“But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home”  That’s why… wondering if you read the article lol they made a strong case for why it mentions pride flags rather than others",LoveDeluxe,2025-05-06T00:36:50,11
"That’s one state. It doesn’t explicitly say the confederate flag or flags of treasonous seditionists. Conservatives would simply argue the flag is just history, not ideology or political party.   And the article is about more than one state.",JewsieJay,2025-05-05T23:00:55,19

"Well, you managed to cram your manifesto into the length of a tweet, so... there's that, I suppose.

Current actually. And saying a pride flag discriminate against a religion is like saying the government is discriminating against a religion by having POW flags since many religions are against war.,citizen_x_,2025-05-06T14:06:24,1
"The paragraph I quoted is about more than one state. Meanwhile, please re-read the section which says ""political viewpoints""; claiming such a flag does not express a political viewpoint won't work. Of course, if someone were inclined to be irrationally suspicious of others to the point said someone presumes said others are going to automatically win because ""they conspire together"", I am not going to give much of a shit what said someone thinks on the subject since cynicism is a variety of slander.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2025-05-05T23:45:21,-9
