Weird. They insisted Biden was a criminal because his son did business with foreign countries when Biden wasn’t even in office.   Now it’s apparently fine for the president himself to set up corrupt vehicles to take bribes from foreigners.,Gr8daze,2025-05-09T15:04:45,25
Lol.  I know the cult will believe anything but truly the level of insider trading and grifting with the Trump administration and republicans in congress is truly gross.,JDogg126,2025-05-09T14:38:14,17
I think that quite literally every decision the man has made since taking office has been self-motivated. For personal gains.   I don't think he's done a single presidential act.   Beyond taking the oath. Which apparently he didn't even remember taking because he doesn't feel he has the need to uphold the Constitution,Higher-Ed,2025-05-09T14:52:15,17

He didn’t place his hand on the Bible during the Oath swearing. Watch him try to lean on that when push comes to shove. It reminds me of George Santos and the whole “Jew-ish” thing.,sllh81,2025-05-09T17:07:11,7
