"Our oldest kid is off to college in a few months as a bio major intending on doctorate (a lot can change,,, I know).   Of her 3 closest friends- one plans on neuroscience, just like her parents. The other 2 friends are headed into one of the top engineering programs in the US.   Of these 4 incredibly smart young people - 2 are brown, 1 gay, all 4 female.  None of them plan on finishing their undergrads in the States. Research funding being cut, concern of science based findings being suppressed, DEI.   I do not even know or talk to all that many people.  But this just feels likeâ€¦ a pretty big deal.",hotdog31,2025-04-28T10:47:01,4
"And so the ""intelligence"" (whats left of it) will be bleeding out of America. Students will go overseas, get taste of public health care, shelves full of food, cheap eggs, democracy, no school shootings, way higher lowest wages, paid vacations, labor laws that protect employee, not employer and maternity leave and what you think they gonna do - they gonna migrate and stay there.

"Why would you want to be a student in America though when you can face any kind of hassle when you just want to be doing a course and having what's supposed to be one of the best times of your life.  BBC reports 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed.  Or the Canadian recently detained by ICE for 3 weeks. Or the UK  Graphic artist Rebecca Burke ""on the trip of a lifetime. But as she tried to leave the US she was stopped, interrogated, shackled and branded an illegal alien by ICE. Sent to a detention centre. Now back home, she tells others thinking of going to Trumpâ€™s America: donâ€™t do it""  Why would anyone want to risk even the possibility of an 'Admin error'.  It's common advice now to overseas visitors including business people to America to bring a second empty phone and leave their normal one back home.   Once a country's ethos starts to go as a secure country it's done, as indicated by the huge drop in tourism from so many countries. America under Trump is being branded like a third world country for its risks, corruption and decay of law.
