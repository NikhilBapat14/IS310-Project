I am an American, and in the 10 or so years of witnessing the political life of Donald Trump, I have felt many emotions. Many emotions.  But goddamn. I actually feel empathy *for the first time* at just how out of his depth he really is. . . I just want to take him by the hand and walk him into a first class staff of psychologists and just let him talk it out for however many days and weeks it takes. They can work in shifts, listening and nodding until he just gets tuckered out. Maybe crying. Tissues. Screams.   And when he finally is out of words, I’ll give him a hug, take him by the hand again, and let him go back to Queens to visit his childhood room. And as he sits there, too cringed out to breathe and with some understanding of **what he has added to this world**, and that the idea of *making amends* seems frankly . . . too out of reach, I’ll lock the door, leave him with his thoughts, his regrets, his emotions, and a loaded revolver.

Netanyahu was effectively convinced that only the Russian presence in Syria could limit Iran's influence there. For Israeli leaders, the Assad family's dictatorship had long seemed to be a lesser evil, if only because it respected the ceasefire on the occupied Golan Heights.  Since then, **Netanyahu has continued to accommodate Putin by refusing any military assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022, and by letting his ""Christian Zionist"" allies in the US Congress block US aid to Ukraine from October 2023 to April 2024**  BBC SOUNDS in another pivotal week.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0bqztzm  While a ceasefire is a crucial step towards resolving conflict, it's not guaranteed to succeed without the presence of a peace-keeping force.

"Lol, trusting Russia not working out. Again.  He's been so focused on getting Ukraine to cede territory to end the war, he's forgotten that Putin has no incentive to end the war if he thinks he's winning.  Trump is focused on getting a Trump victory. He wants peace in Ukraine to make himself look good. He's totally focused on getting a ""win"" for himself.  All Putin wants is to convince Trump to drop aid to Ukraine so he can take over the *entire country*. All Russians know this is the goal. All Ukrainians know this is the goal. Russia lies. They say whatever they need to say in the moment to get closer to their goal. And Trump is easily fooled.   Putin has convinced Trump that if he cuts off aid to Ukraine, they'll have no choice but to come to the negotiating table and end the war, ceding territory to Russia. But getting Ukraine to the table has never been the problem. The problem has always been convincing *Russia* to negotiate peace in good faith.  And that means playing hardball with Russia.

It’s a meat grinder, yet Russia isn’t making significant gains, especially for a country that claims to be a “superpower.” If Russia is depleting its arsenal, why doesn’t the POTUS just give Ukraine what it needs to defend its democracy?  Why side with Russia on this? I can’t help but feel that the POTUS would rather align with Russia because of its economic potential—its size, natural resources, and influence. As terrible as it sounds, it feels more like a business decision than a strategic one. With full U.S. backing, Ukraine could absolutely retake all of its land.  It’s just heartbreaking for Ukraine.

This would obviously be political theater as a way of framing trump as successful, but the outcome could be catastrophic.  If this happens, Trump gets a ratings boost, and Russia will be seen as more reasonable. So when the war inevitably resumes, Trump will be able to pin it on Ukraine since ""Putin declared a ceasefire, and couldn't possibly do anything wrong."" Furthermore, trump will have this faux semblance of being a ""successful negotiator"", and will be another massive curtain distracting people from the mountain of shit he's done.

The only peace deal I would respect out of him is forcing Russian to ""give back"" everything they stole in this last invasion, have Ukraine acknowledge Russian ownership or the Crimean Peninsula that Russia stole in the previous invasion. Nothing about Ukraine not being able to join NATO.  Both sides should be unhappy. I'd rather see Ukraine take back all of their territory, but if someone is going to push for a quick peace, it should be that. And not complete appeasement.  Trump is a joke.

"So here's a big question, so far all I've seen is Trump stating Zelenskyy is being called every name in the book because he's pissed.  And I don't blame him, he literally had someone walk onto his proverbial property take 1/3 of the house.  And now he's supposed to be ""happy"" that instead of Putin getting kicked out.. The proverbial cop is basically telling him, let him keep using the 1/3 and you need to give up 1/4 of that all together it's someone elses now.  I'm sure Trump is attaching strings to every and anything that he is offering to Ukraine, and is probably begging to get businesses into Russia.  Which honestly I doubt many companies will want to rush to bring business into Russia.  And even if they do, they will find many US citizens are not eager to go there themselves.  In any case the real Q is Trump repeatedly stated Putin would regret not ending this. And now on the world stage, instead of I dunno.   1. putting Tarrifs up 1000% higher for Russia, and anyone who deals with them.  He's applying it to all of our allies.   2.   Supplying Ukraine with everything and as much as possible.   3.    Talk to all the other countries and lower the cost of oil so it costs Russia more then they make (which is where it's getting to now)   Or any millions of other ways, that he could be showing he's tough on Putin.  At the moment we've got an image of Trump basically begging on his knees, crying that Putin will stop.  reality is, when Ukraine is done, next are Allies..   So I get it Trump wants it over, so that he can have his Gaza strip casino/hotel  and one in Crimea.. He can't really do that if it's a warzone.  And his buddies are going to get all those mining rights as long as the war stops.  (Even temporarily for a few years)  As then they'll get their companies and equipment in and will make trillions)  When war breaks out later, they'll already have their stuff there afterwards.. people will bitch etc..",jkw118,2025-04-24T20:49:52,1

Begging a second world country dictator to take a deal that completely benefits him and screws over a crucial US ally that’s been defending us just as much as they’ve been defending their homeland is so incredibly tragic.  Trump has singlehandedly destroyed the notion of the US as the leader of the free world. He’s made us into a puppet state. We’re no better than Belarus at this point.

"If Trump brokers peace between russia and Ukraine and Putin walks out of the situation with some part of Ukraine territory and free of any charges, then immediately once the deal is done, US public and media will blast Trump as a traitor who helped America's biggest enemy.   It's almost an unresolvable situation and mostly due to Putin - he won't accept not gaining something from this and facing charges/consequences, but there really isn't any normal resolving this without him either gaining nothing or facing charges/consequences. Either of these two has to happen, and he won't accept either, because either means he lost. That's why he's happy a scumbag and weak politician like Trump is in office, because Trump can be manipulated to support russia. But if the result is Putin walks away with both territory and no consequences, then both Trump and Putin absolutely fucked Zelensky and the Ukranian people, Trump like I wrote went against America's interests (which does little harm really, but it reinforces the idea American global dominance is coming to an end), Zelensky is a dork, and Putin is just an abhorrent villain.

">But the ""final"" peace deal that Trump proposed gives Russia everything they want and gives Ukraine nothing...  From what I remember the other day, they did give Ukraine something, but it was very minor. So it is something.   https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas  From that it says they get a robust security guarantee. I am pretty sure putin wouldn't allow this. It would be very minor with no teeth. The only guarantee Ukraine could really count on would be joining NATO which is off the table in this ""deal"".   Returning of a small part of Kharkiv... gee how nice of them.   Unimpeded passage of the Dnieper River... again how nice.   Compensation and assistance for rebuilding... russia will not pay that. It would likely come out of a minerals deal    So it's basically give putin damn near everything he wants, and Ukraine gets enough to say they got something out of it, barely. I don't see how this can be signed.",joat2,2025-04-24T14:25:47,1
"That's actually the funniest thing about all of this. Putin won't stop the war. He's completely conspiracy-brained and is convinced that any deal he makes will just give the shadow cabal that is after him room to maneuver and topple his government (and by ""his government"" I really just mean ""Putin"").  If you offer him everything he asks for, he'll ask for more. If you offer him that, he'll ask for more again. If you tell him ""take whatever you want"" he'll say you're lying and still not take the deal. Nothing short of total submission by the rest of the world would satisfy him, I think.  It could be that Putin eventually ends up being forced to accept some kind of deal, but it will only be by force and he won't stick to any terms not backed up by force (ie: a UN enforced and patrolled border). And trying to sweet-talk him will only make that less likely to happen by encouraging him to think he could get what he wants.  And the reason we know all this is because before the invasion started, Putin *already had* everything he could have wanted. Crimea was safely under Russian control with basically nobody complaining, Ukraine was completely locked out of joining NATO due to territorial disputes, and their economy was humming along with oil sales and foreign investment shuffling billions of dollars into Putin and the other oligarch's bank accounts.  Then he invaded, and now Crimea is unusable as a naval port, NATO is bigger than ever, Ukraine joining NATO is actually being talked about, their economy is on fire (and not in the good way), and they're forced to sell their oil for pennies to India and China. And the toppling of Putin's government is much more likely now than it was before the war as well, though as always that kind of thing is very hard to predict.  The bottom line is that Putin is insane and kind of a dumbass. There will be no deal, just Russia on fire until they burn themselves out, or the rest of the world finally gets off their asses and puts it out for them.",AgentPaper0,2025-04-24T14:27:31,1

And to be honest Trump who normally has a pretty short attention span and even shorter ability to focus on political issues has spent a surprisingly large amount of time on the issue. Granted most of it has been time spent making the issue worse because he's a spiteful idiot who still wants to make the Ukraine President pay for his role in Trumps impeachment, and for making him look bad.   But all that aside I do believe he actually does want to be the person to solve this issue. Sadly, he's also not equipped to do it.

"Nuance is when my favorite color president criticizes genocide and gives an apartheid regime a spending limit on the rifles delivering bullets into civilians' heads.  Genocide is when my least favorite color president delivers 2000-pound bombs to be dropped on schools, hospitals, and temples, but not when the Israel blockade leads to mass starvation, exacerbated by shooting upon civilians in incidents like the Flour Massacre.  Pressure is when my favorite color president says Rafah is a red line, but then allows for a full-scale invasion of that city anyway.  This appeal to Trump being so much worse, while perhaps statistically true, completely dismisses the material reality that the Palestinian genocide has bipartisan support from our politicians and will continue regardless of which party is signing the checks.

"They kind of didn't though. The problem is that the Budapest Memorandum was unfortunately not a legal treaty in the sense that it doesn't compel the signatories to actually do anything if Ukraine was attacked. The only thing the US, UK and France were/are compelled to provide are arms in the case of threats to Ukraine's sovereignty (which you may note has been done).   So, as far as deals go, both the Bush and Clinton administrations got what they wanted in the sense that they removed another nuclear armed state for basically giving nothing in return. It was a can kick down the road for our generation to have to deal with if Russia ever reverted back to authoritarianism again. (which was obviously not as low risk as the Bush and Clinton administrations thought being high on Francis Fukuyama and the idea that history was over).   The failure of the Budapest Memorandum to have teeth calls into question nuclear non proliferation and along with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, it basically is a wider failure of Europe and the US to actively defend its values which has exactly allowed the rise of an authoritarian China.",LuminousRaptor,2025-04-24T14:57:28,2

"You actually make a good point. People always ask, “Why do the good die young?!” But the question really should be, “Why do the bad die old?” And I think you answered it. There has been study after study that shows correlations between stress and all sorts of nasty stuff: cancer, high blood pressure, cognitive decline, etc. What causes stress? Well, if you answer to no one and care about no one but yourself, as long as you’re okay, stress might as well not even exist.  Granted, I could see him tossing in bed at night thinking about getting owned by Barack several years ago at the correspondence dinner or how everyone makes fun of his small hands and similarly sized mushroom head. I don’t know if that releases the same amount of cortisol as, say, the level released in people like you and me when we’re stressed. I think that kind of stress inherently requires an iota of empathy. It also requires a general awareness of yourself and the world around you. I can’t even imagine Trump having sympathy for someone, let alone empathy. And as far as awareness goes … we know how much he doesn’t want to be “woke.”",AlwaysShittyKnsasCty,2025-04-24T17:22:06,1

And post-Communism, there are *alot* of those. Not old people, but violent, very young, very modern people.  Donald Trump has some experience dealing with the American Mafia, with casinos and property, but he's a complete moron.

I say that as someone who was a 2 time bernie supporter and doesn't regret it. I still despise Clinton, and Biden was not my first choice.  But at the end of the day, Biden regularly listened to Sanders and crafted populist pro-labor policy as often as he could with the limited power congress let him legally have, and the GOP took every step possible to limit it, only for Trump to step in and try to go immediately for the dictator moves. It should be obvious, but the media kept calling him ""old"" even when Trump spoke in constant word salad and was worse off mentally.  Even that Debate was not done particularly well. Biden did ""lose"" it in the sense that he lost his focus at a bad time under pressure, but they did everything possible to make it as unfavorable for him as they could, and people forget that Trump was an insane idiot during the debate, hence why harris stomped him the next time.

"I do recall that he did what he could to keep his campaign promises.  Much like Obama, he was stymied at every turn by Congress who seemed to insist that they just couldn't spend any money for anything he wanted to do.   Biden wasn't perfect at all, but he did actually seem to care for his country and constituents.  Even the least of us.  After his 4 years, the economy had risen, unemployment had dropped, and for the most part, many were better off.  As for me?  I've never been better off during any presidency so I never really measure it by that.  I just know that the metrics that people measured by seemed to be better for the country.    Biden seemed happy to continue working as President and seemed fine to continue, but with everyone complaining about his age (which was a masterful piece of propaganda from the GOP, mind you, considering the Trump is almost exactly 4 years younger, meaning that he will be the exact same age as Biden at the end, and yet Trump is now calling for another term in 2028), and likely over some health concern that happened around the time, he dropped out.  He then endorsed Harris as the new nominee.  Naturally everyone got grumpy about it at first, but eventually turned around and supported her nomination.    These are the events as I remember them.  I don't see anything that seems nefarious about her nomination.  I didn't see anyone attempt to contest it (other than the GOP), stating that they were more qualified for the position.  There were just people complaining that it was done too quickly and without consulting them.  What I'm trying to find out is why people are upset about her running?  Why would leaning into the end of Biden's presidency been a good strategy, and for that matter, what does that even consist of?  Nobody was pretending he was perfect, but since he was still president, they still supported him.  That's just good politics.  You don't rag on the boss just because they gave notice that they were quitting.  Back to Harris though.  I still don't get why people were against her.

"The meaning of the words we use is both denotative (what we think of as the literal or dictionary meaning) and connotative (which is very personal and includes emotional and/or experiential meaning we attach to those words as well as cultural influences). These connotative influences are often the reason the denotation of a word drifts over time.  In this particular case I take exception to “gaslighting” coming to mean “lying” (denotatively) p because someone wanting you to believe your understanding of the world and your experience is incorrect (the original meaning of “gaslighting”) is so much more damaging than them simply wanting you to believe a mistruth (lying).  I have some personal experience in this area and that experience has taught me that gaslighting is considerably more disorienting and damaging than just telling a lie. So I think we beed to retain different denotative meanings for these two words.
