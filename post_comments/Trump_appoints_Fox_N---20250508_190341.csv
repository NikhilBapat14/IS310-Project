"Sat on his hands for three years before doing anything because he ""didn't to make it political"".  Ensuing an insurrection is one time you make it political.  Had he done something immediately the country would be a 180 from where we are now.",Corpsehatch,2025-05-09T00:25:15,1
"Well, we allowed it. We allowed it back in 2016, and it’s open the door for what’s happening now. The media has convinced half the country that minorities are somehow to blame for all their problems, and that Trump should be trusted with all the important decisions that will decide the fate of the entire country.",ChanceFresh,2025-05-09T00:01:09,1

"While she may be qualified, it’s no secret that Trump is picking people who are loyal to him. She hasn’t practiced in a long time and like Hegseth both have spent years on a very pro-Trump news source. Vast majority of people Trump has chosen (excluding JD Vance), have praised Trump for one reason or another before they are chosen, and Hegseth scandals are proof loyalty does not make you capable. Kind of a mixed back of reasons.",Partimenerd,2025-05-09T13:12:49,1
