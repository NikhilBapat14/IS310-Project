"I really feel it will either be May or July. June seems quite busy. That being said, if he does leave sooner, I would watch him get ate up alive by Trunp. I really don't think Musk understands just how vulnerable he is compared to even Democrats.",Rosebunse,2025-04-09T21:56:17,3
"Considering he is going to be out by May anyway and has said as much, this seems like a very Trump-esque “talk about something that is already going to happen before it happens and then take credit for it”.   Which honestly we need to do more of, so I’m fine marketing it like this, but if Elon Musk leaves it will have absolutely nothing to do with the actions of Chuck Schumer reading notes into a camera lol. He only has 130 days from inauguration anyway, and you can tell his hearts not in the job as much as it was two months ago. He’ll be gone soon and hopefully slowly fade into his previous job of irrelevant twitter troll.",cpatkyanks24,2025-04-10T06:16:17,2
