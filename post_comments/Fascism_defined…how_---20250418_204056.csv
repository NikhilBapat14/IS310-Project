"Our executive branch, and leaders of the legislative and some members of the judicial want fascism and are trying to make us it. How far we get depends on how much they want it and how much we are willing to oppose them back.",[deleted],2025-04-18T21:10:07,37

"The Executive branch is already there. Particularly with Marco Rubio trying to whitewash his family's history of illegal immigration with cruelty to immigrants.   However, if the people in Congress who are starting to show backbone and the people in the Judiciary who are showing backbone can link arms and protect each other it's not a done deal yet.   Also remember that in the 1960's not only was the military called out against civilians, they opened fire. There may be units who are willing to do that, but it hasn't happened yet.

"Good article about Umberto Eco and his living through Mussolini.  I'd say maga has all those boxes checked.  https://www.openculture.com/2024/11/umberto-ecos-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html  * *The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”* * *The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”* * *The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”* * *Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”* * *Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”* * *Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”* * *The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.”* * *The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”* * *Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”* * *Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”* * *Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”* * *Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”* * *Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”* * *Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”*",misantropo86,2025-04-18T22:57:33,2

"Go ahead and downvote, but some more criteria required of fascism:  1. Violence as the means of suppression (real violence, not, well, 'he yelled at me' violence). 2. Not afraid to publicly hang opponents, critics, etc. 3. Leader with an actual ideology. 4. Purging of the ranks, disappearing loyalists who may be a threat.  Emphasis on 'may be'. Usually by death. 5. Not afraid to thin the herd through purges, war, economic collapse, famine, etc. 6. Historically don't last very long.  Franco's Spain was allowed to exist for decades by the U.S. because Spain mostly stayed out of WWII, and Spain was hardcore against Communism and the U.S. used Spain to keep Communism from spreading across Europe.",crucial_geek,2025-04-18T21:35:30,-4

"Based on one of Trump’s first EO’s, April 20th might be a turning point for, well, everything….  He plans to invoke the Insurrection Act, declaring martial law. If this happens, two things may follow—mass uprising or mass obedience, depending on how threatening this regime is.  I suspect the former over the latter, and I sure hope the barbershop and church goers of 2020 that rejected a lockdown for public safety wake the fuck up, because martial law is far worse than a lockdown.  I suspect tomorrow’s protests will be instigated by plain-clothed feds, so if you attend, please resist the urge to join in. This may very well be Trump’s straw that pushes us into a strict military state. It may also be inevitable, so I’m not sure what to think on that.  Either way, we should all be watching closely this Easter, because our world may be very different when we leave our grandmas house.
