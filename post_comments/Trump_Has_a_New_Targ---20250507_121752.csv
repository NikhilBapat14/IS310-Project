"Google Maps already lists it first as Persian Gulf then (Arabian Gulf) under it.  I'd like to believe that was already there, but I know that's probably not true.",OkayComputer1701,2025-05-07T12:39:51,2
"The corruption here is so deep.  Could you imagine any Democrat president doing this.  Literally using the presidency to make billions and billions.  Then again, they did not seem to car how much he made at tax payers expense the first time.  Just pointed to the Biden, Clinton, Obama, ""crime syndicate"".       I mean, many billions in real estate deals.  And you know he used his position to influence these things.  Like how China did not give Ivanka those deals until he won the first time.  Suddenly they were all approved.  And Xi is a strong good leader and all that.  Rules with that iron fist how Trump likes it.",GuerreroUltimo,2025-05-07T12:47:04,2

"I mean, they are serious about causing harm and def have the power to hurt.  But childish ? Absolutely. They’re serious about their harmful intention, but they aren’t a professional kind of serious that actually cares about the job. They’re serious about their thirst for power,   But they’re childish. Seriously childish. And that will hopefully be the crack leading into their downfall. Preferably sooner than later since they *are* causing serious harm. But thanks to their immaturity, they won’t be able to stay in power for long.",hopefulocto,2025-05-07T12:47:17,3
