"Is this the tan suit all over again? Unless a sitting president shows up naked and licking the windows of his motorcade on the way in, why care?",squunkyumas,2025-04-27T12:59:14,538
So many just silly lies about yesterday too.¬† Hurr durr Macron refused to shake his hand except here's the video of them shaking hands you nincompoops.   https://youtu.be/emium5zGuWE?si=_S1g9Ao-YwtAMzb1   If he's so bad why do they have to make up so many stories about him. ü§î¬†,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-27T13:10:02,219
"Oh and the whole ""other people did it but it's different because he's the leader of the free world' excuse was pathetic as well",Merax75,2025-04-27T15:01:56,78

The media freaks out about everything Trump does it‚Äôs really kind of sad.,WWII-Collector-1942,2025-04-28T04:04:27,12
"Like living with Felix Unger, no matter what he does, the media finds fault and the liberals lap it up.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T13:03:33,30
Typical much ado about nothing. The majority of them don‚Äôt even believe in Christianity anyway. TDS is a real thing no matter how much they hate to admit it.,WatchLover26,2025-04-27T15:17:35,10
"It was never about the suit, it was never about the eggs, just like it was never about the ""signal"" when *signalgate* was the MSM's entire method of reporting on ***the US battle against the Houthis.***  Once a person has shown they're going to fling hate and stink 24/7/365 plus leap year days, it becomes pointless to listen to them any further. People over the age of 35 start valuing their time once they realize it's finite.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-27T13:20:36,20
"President Trump mostly always wears a blue suit, this is common practice for US Presidents!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-27T13:17:25,17
They're running out of things to criticize because the people have heard them so many times.,cambodianerd,2025-04-27T15:54:14,4
"Who gives an F? ""Oh no, Trump wore blue in a cropped photo. OH NO, Macron didn't shake his hand!"".  What is this, Junior High? We got bigger fish to fry, like the hundreds of thousands of kids that got human-trafficked, which nobody is really doing anything about.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-04-27T21:21:10,3

Seriously fuck off with the wearing black to a funeral nonsense.  How many brides are actually pure when they wear a white dress for their wedding?,Beware_the_silent,2025-04-27T13:09:09,-44
Zelenskyy is a disgrace. Can‚Äôt even wear a proper suit. Looks like a Maoist. But I was surprised to see Biden had the strength to leave the beach.,Reaganson,2025-04-27T15:04:23,-20
Honestly the pope was a democrat. Trump dressed appropriately.,day25,2025-04-27T13:45:46,-51

"The party who doesn't care that Zelenskyy doesn't wear a suit, now cares that Trump is wearing a blue one. Trump could have come in a black suit and they would have still been upset.",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-27T13:14:06,138
"Atheists love telling Christians how we should feel about our own religion. They're the experts.   Just as they know somewhere in the Bible it says to let in all illegal immigrants, they also know Trump committed blasphemy by wearing a blue suit to the Pope's funeral.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-27T13:42:30,31
\>why care?  They care about stupid things all day long because they never care about anything better - and our haters *don't send anyone better*.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-27T13:22:49,-9
You know what‚Äôs sad? Half your upvotes are probably from dense leftist brigaders who are like ‚Äúyeah I know so many awful things!!‚Äù and are completely missing the point of your comment.,superduperm1,2025-04-27T22:40:45,18

"You‚Äôre so right. Excellent work.   The media is clearly working on behalf of the DNC. It‚Äôs been this way for decades but now the talent pool has been diluted to the point they print pure lies to keep liberals triggered. It‚Äôs never been worse than the last 10 years. Now that journalists have been trained since college to resist the Right, and Trump has grown his popularity‚Ä¶.its no holds barred now. EVERYTHING is a constitutional crisis. The media simply creates controversy where there isn‚Äôt but it keeps the useful idiots stirred up and frightened. And when violent action is taken on behalf of the media, boy do they paint it favorably.",Flare4roach,2025-04-27T13:34:08,10
Could you imagine the fake news outrage if he said he wore blue to honor the Blessed Mother?,BoltsFan126,2025-04-28T09:59:50,2
"I‚Äôve been to many funerals. Some we all wore black. Some were in Florida, where it was common for almost no one in attendance to wear black.   I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but when it‚Äôs the Pope‚Äôs funeral and you‚Äôre a leader in the western world, just wear black.",According_To_Me,2025-04-27T13:38:28,31

"You can make this exact same point the other way around. Sure, let‚Äòs care that people are dressed nicely to begin with, but can we please not have this damn theater all the time? It‚Äòs just manufactured outrage. We‚Äòre getting played by the media. 99% of Americans don‚Äòt give a shit when at the same time, the cost of living is breaking our necks.",WillGibsFan,2025-04-27T14:09:21,217
Is that still about the Whitehouse visit... only people who cared about him not wearing a suit were pearl clutching.,thatfordboy429,2025-04-27T14:09:03,38
"Ironically, Zelinsky was the only western male in attendance who didn't wear a suit. I don't think he owns one.",Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-27T13:27:20,42

He has and wears them. He just saves it for the real puppet masters.,planenut767,2025-04-27T15:54:39,-15
"Okay... I have never worn a suit to a funeral. But it's down to the dress the family wished. In lieu of that, if there is a condition that requires/calls for a suit then he deserves to be gone after.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-27T19:06:37,4
