"Welker noted that border crossings were at record lows and asked the president if he felt the border was ""secure."" Trump said, ""it's really secure,"" before asking Welker the question.  ""When you say that, doesn't it just sound good? After being abused for years by an incompetent president that allowed people to pour through an open border, criminals from all over the world, murderers, insane people from mental institutions and insane asylums… isn't it a beautiful thing when you say it's the most secure it's ever been in the history of our country? Isn't that a nice statement?"" Trump asked during the interview.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T12:40:46,30
