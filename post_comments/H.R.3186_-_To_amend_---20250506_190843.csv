"I don't want my money put in some questionable account that could end up being Trump's bank account.  I mean I know he's already squirreling away our money, but I prefer to keep my HSA and know my money is actually there. ",arilupe,2025-05-06T19:12:23,31

"Let me guess, any overpayment will no longer be refunded but instead placed into an account that the government invests as it pleases, but will not be used to cover future lapses in paid taxes nor be withdrawn unless you are retiring, at which point you may discover it either performed worse than an index fund, lost value, or was misappropriated and is now gone. Like Social Security, but worse.",KeviRun,2025-05-06T22:37:48,6

"Look I'm 34 and I wish I could opt out of paying social security. It's literally a scam for my generation. It'll be defunct in a few years, so I wish I could stop paying now.  Cut me a check for 20k and the government can just keep the rest.",Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-06T19:34:28,-38
"Tax-advantaged account for general savings without restrictions. That does have benefits.      If it had greater benefits and restrictions aimed to get it to people on the lower half of the income scale it'd be great. As it is, just another way for well-off folks to not pay taxes.",adopter010,2025-05-06T23:45:34,3
"Untrue -- Social Security is mostly a ""pay as you go"" system. Each year, a bunch of people who are working pay a bunch of taxes; that money is then paid out to the beneficiaries. The ""mostly"" part is that thanks to the baby boom, we've got a ""hump"" of retirees. Because this was totally foreseeable, we paid extra into the system to generate a mound of extra money.  Per the social security trustee projections, once the chunk of extra money we saved up is gone, the incoming money is enough to pay for about 78% of the promised amount. But, social security is a super popular program, and the chances that it won't be saved is about 0%. There's a bunch of proposed ways to ensure people get their promised benefits.  The only way you won't get money is if the entire economy is completely hosed for decades. And if that happens, there's no realistic ""plan B"" for most people. Personally, I don't think that will happen: America has far too many smart, driven people with a diverse set of skills, plus amazingly productive farmland, and all hte minerals you can shake a stick at.",rsclient,2025-05-06T19:45:16,24

"Social security isn't a scam, and it will be there for our generation as long as it isn't shuttered for whatever reason.  These are lies told to us, to hide the fact that as long as it isn't fucked with, it is actually one of the most stable and secure investitures our government has ever made in history, period.  The biggest issue with it, is a lack of initial funding, yes. But the easiest way to solve that, is to just release the income limit for paying into it. There is a maximum amount that an individual can pay into it; make it unlimited, and literally every problem ever is solved with it.  Edit: depending on how it is designed, it might actually be really effective. But it really depends on who is proposing the system. If the Trump administration is introducing it, then yeah....",ragingreaver,2025-05-06T19:49:56,14
"Defunct? Conservative propaganda really propagates. Whatever timeframe they say it’ll go “defunct” Social Security will still pay out around 80%. It’s a pay-as-you go system. Social security taxes are collected and then paid out. It keeps a large percentage of elderly people from being homeless. We’ve all seen the homelessness crisis, it can be worse.",JewsieJay,2025-05-06T21:15:02,6

"Ugh here we go again, someone with strong opinions about something that have a fundamental misunderstand of how it works.   Here's the one stat you need to know;  if there were zero changes to social security, when you retire you would receive 83% of what you would receive if you retired right now.  I implore you to do your own research, but basically SS ran a surplus on what it collected versus what it paid out for a number of years.  Sometime in the last 30 years, that equation flipped and the money they built up during the surplus is making up for that deficit.  Once that runs out, which is projected to happen in ~10 years, then the program can only use the money it takes in to pay out.  And without changes, that means a reduction to 83% of current benefits.   Unless they intend to pay me back the money I've contributed at this point, I'd much rather get that 83% than have the program eliminated entirely because it's misunderstood.",drwhoovian,2025-05-07T10:14:36,2

"Here's a problem with increasing the income limt: it creates an obligation to pay benefits based on that income in the future. Calculating the primary insurance amount (PIA) uses three ""bend points"" where your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) contribute different amounts to your benefits.  This is made up, but should show the point. .Suppose that the form of the equation used to calculate your benefits is:  90% of AIME up to $1000 per month plus  25% of AIME between $1000 per month and $5000 per month plus  15% for all AIME above $5000 per month.  Suppose that I have $10000 in AIME.,My PIA, not including any reduction for claiming benefits early,  is $900 plus $1000 plus $750. or $2650 per month.  We pay only 6.2% of income (12.4% counting the employer contribution.  Now apply the formula to someone with $105,000 in AIME where there is no limit on income on the amount sunject to FICA tax. They would get $900 plus $1000 plus $15,000, or $16,900 monthly, which is more than the employer and employee contributions when they were working.  *I hope that this points out the need to add more bend poinrs where one accrues only 1, 2 or 5  percent of AIME in benefits if you want to uncap the earnings limit.*",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-06T20:04:44,-1
"So, a system that's worked for decades, seeing us through a number of massive changes in workplace participation, wars, and recessions, is suddenly a scam?  If you had said, ""it's unwise to carry this system through because of upcoming massive changes"", we could have a discussion. But calling one of the most successful programs of all time, one that's replicated in essentially ever major industrialized democracy, a ""scam"" is wildly overblown.",rsclient,2025-05-06T20:08:35,17
"Or we just learn to tell those who are rich that they just have to pay more in taxes, because that is what is good for the nation as a whole, and what creates long term stability like Europe.  We are literally the tax haven capital of the planet, and we have an income disparity equivalent to that of a third world nation. It is high time we modernize, and that means raising taxes on those most able to afford them. WITHOUT any additional benefits.",ragingreaver,2025-05-06T20:30:50,11

"Not the same person you were answering, but while we're lifting the contribution limit, I feel we should also set a maximum benefit. We seem to have no problem setting maximum benefits for other programs. Unemployment insurance, for example, has a maximum payout regardless of income. My wife was laid off in the fall and the benefit was less than half of her previous income.   Maybe create some formula based on median income and peg it as the maximum. Try to make sure it's a reasonably liveable number. Keep the bend points and add ""up to a maximum benefit of $X"".",thepaddedroom,2025-05-06T20:39:31,6
"It worked so far doesn't mean it will work in the future. The important thing that you're missing isn't that it works or doesn't. It's that in 40 years it's hard to imagine SS still existing, or, being functional.",No_Anxiety285,2025-05-06T20:20:44,-19
"The purpose of having the extra bend points is to come close to setting a maximum benefit without actually capping it. Social Security isn't an investment program ,but a insurance program.  The current replacement rate of Social Security is about 40% of your final income, presuming that you retire at full retirement age or older. If you retire at 62, it will be about 28% of final income. This will drop to about 30% and 23% once the special purpose bonds that  Social Security holds have been sold off.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-06T21:17:33,1
"You've been awfully vague about what you actually expect to happen.

"I'm agreeable to your previous suggestion of more bend points with smaller percentages. I think the exact formulation can be argued, but I think there needs to exist a scenario where high earners can contribute more than they take back out. I'm not quite at the contribution limit, but I'm getting close. I'm ok with the idea of having a maximum benefit cap so long as the amount is relatively liveable.  I understand it's insurance and not investment (outside of investing in the externalities provided by the safety net). I want to rebuild the trust.",thepaddedroom,2025-05-06T21:52:50,2
