Why Americans had not seen that before the election?  Didn't Trump promise to be a dictator on day 1?,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-01T14:32:06,98

"By Martha McHardy ‚Äî US News Reporter |  A majority of Americans now say they believe President Donald Trump fits the description of a ""dangerous dictator,"" according to new polling.  Trump swept back into office carrying a large amount of political clout after Republicans won all three branches of government. He carried positive poll numbers and Americans approved of him on key issues like immigration and the economy.  As Trump's approval ratings have slipped, including slumping numbers on his handling of the economy, the poll underscores an erosion of support and suggests that Trump's confrontational style, once viewed as strength, could now be becoming a threat to his political capital.

5000 people is an absolutely massive sample size and muuuuch larger than you need for statistical significance.   Regardless of the size of the population being sampled.  They could have fucked up making it a _representative_ sample but that's an entirely separate issue that had nothing to do with objecting to the sample size.   If I were secretary of education I would investigate whether we should make statistics a mandatory course for all students and doing so earlier than it's generally taught now.  It would be incredibly useful for understanding the world in a way much of the math kids are taught is not.,GCU_ZeroCredibility,2025-05-01T19:05:47,16
