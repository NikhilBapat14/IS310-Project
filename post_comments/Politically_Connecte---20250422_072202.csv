"Some of the key sections from this piece:  >After President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, the White House released a list of more than a thousand products that would be exempted. > >One item that made the list is polyethylene terephthalate, more commonly known as PET resin, the thermoplastic used to make plastic bottles. > >Why it was spared is unclear, and even people in the industry are confused about the reason for the reprieve. > >But its inclusion is a win for Reyes Holdings, a Coca-Cola bottler that ranks among the largest privately held companies in the U.S. and is owned by a pair of brothers who have donated millions of dollars to Republican causes. Records show the company recently hired a lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump White House to make its case on tariffs. > >Whether the company’s lobbying played any role in the exemption is unclear. Reyes Holdings and its lobbyists did not respond to questions from ProPublica. The White House also did not comment, but some industry advocates say the administration has rebuffed requests for exemptions. > >The resin’s unexplained inclusion on the list exemplifies how opaque the administration’s process for crafting its tariff policy has been. Major stakeholders are in the dark about why certain products face levies and others don’t. Tariff rates have been altered without any clear explanation for the changes. Administration officials have given conflicting messages about the tariffs or declined to answer questions at all. > >The lack of transparency about the process has created concerns among trade experts that politically connected firms might be winning carve-outs behind closed doors. > >... > >Another industry that appears to have done relatively well lobbying for carve-outs from the recent tariffs is agriculture. The exemption list includes various pesticide and fertilizer ingredients. > >The American Farm Bureau Federation, an agricultural lobby, took credit for some of those exemptions in an analysis posted on its website recently, calling exemptions for peat and potash “hard fought for by agricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation” and “a testament to the effectiveness of farmers’ and ranchers raising their collective voice.”  And the corruption of the government by this administration continues apace. It seems that with the people running the country today, Hanlon's razor no longer applies to their policies.",Hrmbee,2025-04-22T07:26:41,7
Superpacs and lobbying will be the causes of the ultimate downfall of the USA. Impossible to avoid favouritism and corruption with so much money flowing to parties.,Fritja,2025-04-22T08:07:40,2

"> polyethylene terephthalate  Now this angers me.
