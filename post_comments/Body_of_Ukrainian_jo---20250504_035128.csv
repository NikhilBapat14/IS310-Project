Wouldn't returning the body with no eyes or brain make the torture MORE obvious?,-DizzyPanda-,2025-05-04T11:25:31,426
"This is what happens, unseen and unreported by the mainstream media, on the territories Russia captures. This is why just remaining in existence as an independent country in the face of Russias 2014 invasion is a Ukrainian victory and this is what will happen to other countries Russia will invade if Russia succeeds in consolidating and forcing a bad peace in Ukraine.",nar_tapio_00,2025-05-04T03:55:48,1542

Removing some of the organs ESPECIALLY the eyes and brain will just make it more obvious that foul play was involved.  The Russian government really didn’t think this one through 😂🤦🏻‍♂️!,Royal_IDunno,2025-05-04T23:09:42,24

"The best guess is that she was strangled to death. That shows in a broken bone (which has been removed), in brain damage (which is gone) and in the eyes somehow (which are gone).

"Uh, no. Gonzalo Lira did not get this ‘mummy treatment’. He was also giving away key military details to Ukraine’s enemies, intentionally. Big difference from him and a journalist with no criminal record.  Not to mention that he was a rapist and creep (so quite fitting for a Russian ally.)

"Yes. You are right, but we should not mistake a temporary pause which gives Russia greater strength to attack later for a stop.

It's on many other places including both serious journalists and the Ukrainian government. Also the family has responded demanding international investigation. This is a pretty clear case. Remember Ukraine is not Russia so things they say that aren't true can be investigated and if something is being hidden it will be published. A physical body is pretty clear and difficult to fake evidence.,nar_tapio_00,2025-05-04T05:39:22,440

"if you were a journalist depicting the invasion of your country and you got tortured and killed for that against all international and moral laws i don't feel like anyone should shrug and say you should have been more careful.   With this mentality the US would never exist with no revolution, Europe would be under nazism (and US would be a regional power at best) and the world would generally be a pretty shitty place.

"Europe is, not enough, less then they should, but more then the US even though it has less weapons to give and smaller GDP.    Europe is increasingly covering most of aid to Ukraine  and Ukrainian production now is equally important, but    A even if US aid only becomes 1/3 of total aid, that's still 1/3 to substitute in the short term, not easy       B there are some specific weapon systems that Europe can't provide such as patriot missiles and missile systems. Ukraine (probably through EU money) offered to buy some from the US, at the time it seems the US refused, hopefully that was a momentary lapse of judgement.   Personally i think the US should start by seizing 5 Billion russian assets and using those for more military aid while extending sanctions. It would be a good start and would optain the maximum benefits available to the US for the minimal cost (though the best outcome would be medium cost for more serious benefits)",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-05-10T09:35:51,3

"… difference in kind and scale, maybe? You can’t equate them, even if both do have faults. They’re not comparable in depth, nor in frequency of occurrence.

Delusional. Russia could end Ukraine tomorrow if it wanted to. What is wrong with your brains? The more of a threat to Russia that Ukraine becomes and insists on becoming the more Russia will want to continue the war to neutralize that threat.

Russia hasn’t been doing as well these days but it’s still a super power and threatening nuclear war is something we can’t just ignore especially when it’s as a threat to stop us from helping an allied nation.

">  super power and threatening nuclear war  It's not threatening nuclear war.  The only way that happens is if we escalate the situation.

Because it's certainly not Ukraine.  >I’m sure you’d agree that doesn’t put us on a very strong footing  I think that we should be trying to get Russia to help us against China, not spending billions on a country that we don't care about.

War with Russia? Wow what a great plan.  Lira was peddling military secrets? What the hell are you talking about? He had no security clearance he was just a citizen journalist... and you didn't have a word of condemnation. Do you think maybe Putin killed this journalist (if that's even true) because he thought they were harming the war effort? It goes both ways.

"Read up: Lira was not mummified. He WAS, however, sharing troop movements (illegal under martial law). Military movements. Explicitly a no-go for posting publicly on social media. You don’t have to like it, but you cannot call him innocent.  Lira and Roschyna are different cases. He (a non-Ukrainian sex pest) chose to be in Ukraine while martial law reigned. She never left her homeland, Ukraine (as a Ukrainian journalist) - but was forcibly removed to a Russian detention center.  She supposedly faced electroshock torture and strangulation.    To your first point: Yeah I’m not for normalizing ANYTHING coming from Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Qatar, Saudi, North Korea, etc. and NOT sorry. These f**kers need to be shut down with examples of hard power capability. I speak as someone who actually exists in these cultures.   I do think we should seek much closer relations with ASEAN and central/Anti-Russian Eastern Europe. Isolationism will be a failure.  Guess what? Those like me still exist in the conservative movement. We believe the world is better with American hegemony reigning. ",PotatoesAndElephants,2025-05-04T22:39:44,8
