You need to keep the public away from the protest. Do not allow anyone to go up and feed them or give them water.  They are going to have to shit themselves and pee and eat and drink sometime.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-21T18:15:07,21
"Lol… I just saw a video of liberal students complaining about a Christian ""street preacher"". Well… At least that street preacher isn't forcing you to listen to what he has to say. He just stands on a corner and speaks. Liberals force you to listen to their politics by doing things like this - blocking roads and streets, burning down buildings and private businesses, attacking conservative college kids, knocking Trump hats off of people's heads while attacking them lol. Liberals are the worst street preachers known to man.....",BossJackson222,2025-04-21T20:37:49,9
