"""Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It’s not so bad' or 'You’re seeing things' or 'You’re an alarmist.'  And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.""  -Milton Sanford Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45*",pleasedothenerdful,2025-04-25T14:04:11,9

A plan to disenfranchise the middle and lower class and line their pockets with Blood money. Boy they really know how to bamboozle the hell outta sanctimonious pharisaical folks. People should just let go and let God do his thing. Coming from an omnist I'm someone who believes in all religions or faiths, or in a single transcendent purpose that unites all things. Omnists embrace religious diversity and practice tolerance, viewing each religion as a unique expression of a deeper truth.  Matthew 13:24-30 This parable describes a farmer planting good seeds in his field, but while he slept, an enemy sowed weeds among the wheat. The servants ask if they should pull up the weeds, but the farmer says to let them grow together until harvest time. Then, at harvest, the weeds will be gathered and burned, while the wheat is stored away.  This parable can be interpreted as a metaphor for the presence of evil and bad influence in the world, even within good things. It emphasizes that judgment will come, and that we shouldn't prematurely try to fix everything ourselves, but instead trust in the ultimate sorting out that will occur at the end of time.

Circus or not the day I'm summoned or named in a criminal case for giving a candidate $100 is going to be the loudest memory in my head every time I think about donating in the future.  The judge is pushing it and VERY much a distraction to draw ire away from the campaign funding case. The judge did take action to hide and relocate a person they knew would be arrested. It's kinda like if I knew the police were going to meet you at my house tonight when you came to visit and I covertly communicated that to you with the express intent to use my advance knowledge of the raid to undermine it's success.

So Obama called their bluff. It was a great move, too, because he knew going in that the Congress wouldn't actually confirm anyone.. So at least make them call out their hypocrisy.

"It's because the majority of people cannot read the room.  There are too many people that wait for some kind of warning instead of being able to make that decision themselves.  Another example is being at the beach. You're enjoying the ocean views, the seagulls snatching away some dude's food, nice partly cloudy sky, when you notice without a doubt that the ocean level on the beach is dropping.   Dramatically. It's not the water going back a couple feet to make a wave, I'm talking all of the fucking water just disappeared and you can see wet sand for ***miles.***   If you are knowledgeable about this, you'll start warning people what's happening and to seek higher ground. There will be some people who hang around until their phone goes off with Tsunami Warning: Seek Higher Ground Immediately. Then they'll go ""oh, we should leave."" and they start heading towards the hills.   Meanwhile people who recognized the warning signs and knew what was about to happen, they're already reaching the top of the hills and watching the Tsunami roaring across the streets.   Except a key difference here is the threat now comes from our own government. The same agencies that would issue the warning,  that millions of people are waiting for.   He's not going to fucking warn you, people. Nobody's getting a government alert to leave the country.

In Canada the conservative candidate was something like 30 points ahead, the centre left Liberals were facing a major defeat but now they're looking likely to retain a majority in their election in the next few days.  In Australia the leader of the conservative Liberal Party saw Trump's win and thought it was a winning strategy. He started using Trump talking points and rhetoric and was polling with massive leads over the centre left Labor Party. That was until Trump was actually inaugurated and Aussies have seen what Trump has been doing. Labor has been gaining and eventually leading in the polls ever since then and now it's looking like they'll likely gain an even bigger majority in parliament at the election in two weeks time.  Obviously we won't know how far left or right both countries have gone since Trump became US president until after the elections and we can't know how things will be in 5 to 10 years but so far it's looking promising that Trump-like candidates are being rejected in Australia and Canada.",Equivalent_Low_2315,2025-04-25T21:47:03,3

"And my point is just that the phrase ""a pool of qualified candidates"" essentially hand-waves away the entire problem they're claiming to solve. Unless they can answer how to define a pool of qualified candidates without giving people in power an opportunity for corruption and manipulation, they're not proposing a solution, they're just proposing making the current problem more complicated. They're suggesting this as a solution for protecting the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, but they're just moving the politics around to where they're harder to expose.  >a different pool of judges doing the choosing  Selected by whom?  >who have a proven track record of adhering to a set of standards  Defined by whom? Assessed how?  For a system to actually protect independence and impartiality, it would have to be possible for your worst opponents to implement it and still yield a result you'd deem basically fair. If you're as vague as ""a pool of qualified judges"", Trump would get a list of judges from the heritage foundation and say those were the only qualified judges. If you say ""a proven track record"", he'd say anyone who's never ruled in favor of an immigrant, or in favor of a person over a business. If you say ""chosen by a pool of sitting judges"", he'll pick his most loyal. If you say ""chosen by a pool of sitting judges, who are themselves randomly selected from the federal bench"" he's in luck, because he's already packed the federal bench and it already leans heavily in his favor. The system is already corrupted and already choosing not to fix itself, and assigning a random subset of its members the task of fixing it won't change that.  You can't fix corruption by giving the corrupt power.",carsncode,2025-04-26T07:17:44,0
