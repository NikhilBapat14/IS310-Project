">Are minor parties 100% parties?  Yes  >If so, why is the US considered a two-party system?  The electoral systems in vast majority of the US make it extremely difficult for minor parties or independents to succeed therefore the default is that the 2 current major parties are the only viable options.  >Just because those smaller parties don't have enough support, or are there other reasons?  It's difficult to gain support with restrictive electoral systems and finance laws that allow those major parties to have far more resources to develop policy, communicate with people and retain a presence.  > What's the difference between minor parties and being an independent   The difference between a minor party and an independent is that a minor party is a party, likely with values and policies and candidates advocate for those policies with the support of the party. Parties are useful for pulling reosurces together. An independent isn't affiliated, at least directly, to any party. They don't have a party behind them, they often have organisations and/or community groups which are in support of them.",Mitchell_54,2022-10-04T19:42:05,4
"Most of the US's election laws (federal & state) are built around 2 parties so most people register as Republican or Democrat. Registering as Independent isn't considered being in a third party. It's more like being unaffiliated. It doesn't have leaders or a platform or anything. Whether or not it's a good idea can vary by state. In many states you can vote in any election but in some you can't vote in primaries or certain other elections so a lot of people will pick one of the two parties instead.  Third parties are real parties, but they have a hard time getting enough votes to compete on a large scale, based on state laws or just that people are so used to there only being 2 parties and only voting for one or the other. Every now and again a socialist or somebody gets elected as a mayor of a town, but a lot of changes to election laws would need to take place for third parties to be anywhere near prominent enough to get a significant portion of the vote in a bigger election.   Note: election laws vary quite a bit from state to state. Some are downright byzantine and some are more straightforward. I am for overhauling the whole system and standardizing it (at the very least), but there is a lot of resistance to change. Although, I think more people are ready for a change now than in a long time.",TieStreet493,2022-10-04T19:48:23,2
Minor parties are officially registered political parties that basically don't matter at all.  The only reason being independent matters is that some states limit voting in a primary to registered members of the two parties that do matter.,Blear,2022-10-04T19:35:29,1
"An independent is a voter or candidate who isn't registered with any political party.  Major and minor party status are explicitly defined distinctions within each state's elections department which effects a lot of criteria such as signature requirements for ballot access, publicly funded campaign eligibility, and a whole host of other things.   Third parties, which many mistakenly call minor parties, are simply every other registered political party that isn't directly affiliated with the Democratic and Republican parties. Some such as the Libertarian Party have major party status within some states.   United States is referred to as a two-party system simply because the two main parties themselves (Democratic and Republican parties) are big tent coalitions that win over 95% of every elected office. Many other nations have multiple parties that get elected to form a coalition once in office, in our system due to massive institutional inertia they simply form the coalition first then get elected.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-10-04T19:37:38,1
"The accepted standard that political scientists use to determine a party system is how many parties are elected into the legislature, NOT how many parties claim to exist or get votes in any given election. This makes a lot of sense because it allows a system to exclude obvious joke parties like the Rent is Too Damn High Party, or quasi-parties that are only sort of independent like the Working Families Party. If we just looked at anyone who got votes, we'd even have to debate if the MAGA or Tea Party folks were actual third parties (which we probably should do somewhat anyway but from a different perspective and that's another conversation). Basically, the actual stuff that's really important to measure as the folk who know most about this stuff all agree is whether or not they can win a seat somewhere.  This also makes sense from a very practical standpoint. Things are not accomplished in government just by fiat--even if a third party were to win a prominent office like the Presidency by some miracle, they still wouldn't be able to actually DO anything because they would lack the party infrastructure necessary to actually govern. I mean, Jo Jorgensen could make her platform literally anything and it wouldn't matter. Even if she did get elected, the fact that she has zero party members in the legislature and zero political relationships and zero connections with any sort of volunteer network or any sort of organized political power means her policies could be the most excellent, reasonable, perfect things in the world and she would have no power to enact ANY of it without the actual real parties doing it for her. In other words, if you don't have an actual party of people supporting your platform, policies, ideas, and candidates...you're not a real party.  This is why many folks, including myself, argue that the ""third parties"" in the US aren't real parties. The Greens and Libertarians put zero effort in winning actual elections. These parties put no effort in starting at the grassroots level to build up voter coalitions that can form competitive platforms in real elections, but instead focus on an impractical national level that does little aside from raise money to funnel into broad and unconvincing advocacy campaigns.   I'd also say using this same definition you could argue effectively that we HAVE seen actual third parties in the US system in the Tea Party and the MAGAs. Of course, the fact that these folks eventually crashed back into the main conservative party and remade it into something different instead of maintaining their independence is exactly why the US DOES have a two party system. Two party systems don't mean there cannot possibly be a third party at any point. They simply mean that the system is at a stable equilibrium when there are a maximum of two ""real"" parties.   I would also say Forward is much more similar to the Greens and Libertarians than a real third party challenger. Forward trying desperately to prove its relevancy, but anyone who's done a little bit of study of party systems should be VERY skeptical of them actually achieving that.",mormagils,2022-10-04T23:18:02,1
"The ""two-party system"" refers to the practical situation, not any kind of official policy.   It's considered a two-party system because when you ask the question ""What party will win Congress/President?"" the answer is 100% ""Democrats"" or ""Republican"".",avatoin,2022-10-17T13:41:24,1
Is there anything that holds them down? Or simply people not voting for these parties?,napa0,2022-10-04T19:36:39,1
"The way the US election system work (in most states and localities) is whoever gets the most votes wins. It doesn't have to be a majority of votes, just whoever has the highest number of votes. For example, the state of Wisconsin in 2020 was won by Joe Biden, even though he only had 49% of the popular vote in the state. Even though a majority of people voted for ""Not Biden"", he won the state.  So extrapolating this knowledge, the issue with a growing 3rd party is any 3rd party will likely hurt their own cause by doing so. For example, let's say the Green Party (the environmental, left-wing party) started gaining popularity. Right now, they get ~1% of the popular vote every election. If they started gaining popularity, they would likely get most of their votes from the Democratic Party, as the Democratic Party is the closes of the two major parties in terms of platforms.  So take Michigan in 2020. Biden got 50.6% of the popular vote, Trump got 47.8%, and the Green Party Candidate (Hawkins) got 0.25%. If the Green Party got more popular, let's say they get 15% of the vote, most of those votes would be taken from the Democratic Party. So let's say 10% move from Biden to Hawkins, and 5% move from Trump to Hawkins. That makes the final vote Hawkins 15.25%, Biden 40.5%, and Trump 42.8%. Trump would win the state, even with a minority of the votes. And now the Green Party and Democratic Party, who support clean energy and other left-wing policies, have gotten the Republican elected who is against both those things.  So the issue with voting 3rd party in the US is the vote is practically more likely to hurt your cause than help it. Voting Green instead of Democrat is more likely to get a Republican elected which is the OPPOSITE of what a Green voter wants.  It should be noted the Green Party has accomplished two things in he past 3 decades. 1) Gotten George W. Bush elected over Gore in 2000 and 2) Gotten Trump elected over Clinton in 2016. Both of those accomplishments have the opposite effect of what Green voters want.",ProLifePanda,2022-10-05T05:47:00,2
"The two major parties have had a stranglehold on American politics for a hundred fifty years or so.  They're like corporate monopolies, no competing parties can thrive.  Everyone I know would seriously consider voting for another party if one existed that had a chance in hell, but that's not possible anytime soon",Blear,2022-10-04T19:42:00,1
And this can also go the other way around with minor right wing parties too? Couldn't there be a second round of elections with the 2 most voted like other countries?,napa0,2022-10-05T06:05:52,1
">And this can also go the other way around with minor right wing parties too?  Of course. I could have made the same argument using the Libertarian Party, which is (generally) more right-wing than the Republican Party. I believe their major contribution the past couple decades is getting Biden elected in 2020.  >Couldn't there be a second round of elections with the 2 most voted like other countries?  There could be. The issue is you would need politicians to vote to change the election system that they win in, risking their re-election. So while it has some momemtum at the voter level, many of the entrenched politicians are hesitant to do it for fear that it will hurt their seat or their party.   For example, Alaska recently instituted ""First Past the Post"", which ensures the winner gets a majority of the votes. In the first round, the Democrat got 36.8% of the Vote, and the two Republicans got 30.2% of the vote and 26.2% of the vote. The lowest Republican was eliminated, and the Democrat won with 51.5% of the vote. So the Republicans are upset because even though the first round of voting showed a >50% of voters favoring Republicans, the Democrat ended up winning. A Democrat hasn't won this election since the 1970's, so it was a pretty big flip. Now obviously this can be at least partially attributed to the candidate quality, but you can see many Republicans are speaking out against new voting methods based on that outcome.",ProLifePanda,2022-10-05T06:15:07,2
