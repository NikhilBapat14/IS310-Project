"It’s literally his job:  **He shall …  take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.**  Those laws include making sure everyone gets whatever due process the Constitution requires.  He doesn’t get to pick and choose.   https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-3/take-care-clause-overview  Imagine if he was on a McDonald’s crew and the regional manager asked him on his 100th day, “Are you supposed to make sure the orders are right?”   There are lots of correct answers, but “I don’t know” isn’t one of them.",guttanzer,2025-05-04T19:50:08,15
">The Constitution states only one command twice. The [Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment) says to the federal government that no one shall be ""deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."" The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv), ratified in 1868, uses the same eleven words, called the Due Process Clause, to describe a legal obligation of all states. These words have as their central promise an assurance that all levels of American government must operate within the law (""legality"") and provide fair procedures.  >https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process",progress18,2025-05-04T19:27:52,10
"He's doing that a lot, just saying he doesn't know, ask his attorney general or whatever. And he says Biden was out of it! The nerve. Can there be a president under 80 please?",WendySteeplechase,2025-05-04T20:49:04,6
"Ok, I'm NOT a lawyer either, BUT I paid attention in my social studies classes, AND I READ. (THE CONSTITUTION.) So even I, yes, I-- just a mere CITIZEN of the U.S.-- DO, in fact, KNOW-- that EVERYONE is INDEED ENTITLED to DUE PROCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I'm so sorry I'm yelling again, y'all).",Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-05-04T19:58:45,4
"What's funny is Trump regularly claims ""I know more than the generals"" and ""I know more than the doctors"" on so many issues but on this one issue, darnit, he just isn't qualified to answer.",louisianapelican,2025-05-04T22:59:45,3
"Trump is just a dumb head on top of a dumpy body with no mind of his own, powered by nothing but ambition. He’ll let his handlers answer the hard questions. He’s too busy playing mob boss to care.",absolutelynotagoblin,2025-05-04T23:13:54,3
"Dude you are the president, knowing constitutional rights is kind of important",timberwolf0122,2025-05-05T03:45:56,3
"TBH, That's probably the telltale that he's not running the country.  His little Goebel is probably the one who runs it under his name.",ledude1,2025-05-05T00:19:29,2
I think he has been involved in enough lawsuits to know what due process means.,Vesvictus,2025-05-05T06:31:09,2

This response makes it unclear whether or not Trump can read because some of the things he has done include the possibility of incarceration if political winds shift.,nanoatzin,2025-05-05T00:25:15,1
"Understandable as he doesn’t even know if it’s his duty to defend the constitution. You know, the very thing he swore to do when taking the oath of office.",ukexpat,2025-05-05T10:04:18,1

"Honestly, I know people at this point who absolutely hate him for the Pope photo. Yes, it took the Pope photo for them to turn on him.   However, at least they finally came to their senses...",_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-05-07T14:02:06,1
"He lied to get elected, I have friends that have expressed regret that they voted for him especially after they have experienced a loss due to his actions.",Johnqpublic25,2025-05-05T05:11:46,3
I don't think his age has anything to do with this. I doubt he paid attention in social studies class. ,FuzzyComedian638,2025-05-04T21:26:44,4

"Yeah, Vance is 40. Younger people are idiots too (I’m 26 FWIW). I forget who said it, it might’ve been Biden, it’s not about your age, it’s about the age of your ideas. That quote has always resonated with me.",Alex72598,2025-05-05T08:20:37,3
