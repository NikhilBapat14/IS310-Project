"By Gabe Whisnant — Breaking News Editor |  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under mounting scrutiny after reports revealed he pulled highly sensitive information about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen from a secure military communications channel and shared it via Signal, an unsecured messaging app, with his wife, brother, lawyer, and others.  NBC News first reported that the data — including launch and bomb drop times for U.S. warplanes targeting Houthi positions — originated from U.S. Central Command's classified communications. A source familiar with a second Signal chat confirmed to the Associated Press that the same sensitive operational details were shared again, this time with an even wider circle, raising concerns over a potential security breach.

"So much for the claim Hackseth made that the info wasn't classified. Now we have confirmation that info was sent to him via classified messaging system. Can't wait for his next camera face blow up tomorrow. I imagine at this point he's lost any remaining microscopic support still remaining in the Defense Department, and a loss of support of this magnitude will negatively impact combat readiness and strategic planning. Ironically, 2 things he claims he is trying to strengthen by going around firing people for informing him he's wrong.",RJ5R,2025-04-22T11:05:31,4

"Of course he did.  The problem with this guy is he’s insecure and immature. He has a desire to be liked, which is why he couldn’t help himself when he had information that others did not. People like this are always seeking validation and shouldn’t be in positions of power.",hmr0987,2025-04-22T11:27:10,2
