"And ICE just arrested a Democratic judge in New Mexico, too. Apparently the judge rented an apartment to someone who was deported. Forced him to resign from the bench last month and ICE raided his home and arrested him last night.  Trump is going after the judges to intimidate them after his mounting losses in court.

"We are currently entering one of the most dangerous and pivotal phases of this whole shitshow.  Trump is failing on multiple fronts. The economy is on the verge of collapse, the courts have been ruling against him repeatedly, public sentiment is turning against him, progressive politicians are rallying the people, and some members of Congress are on the verge of discovering their spines.   In short, Trump is FLAILING right now.   Which means two things: first, he’s incredibly weak and vulnerable right now. Second, he’s never been more dangerous. He’s a wounded animal, and he’s preparing a desperate all out attack. This is a do or die moment for him and he won’t hesitate. But he absolutely can be defeated if people and institutions stand up to him, even just a little bit.  Look at Harvard. Look at JP Morgan CEO Jaime Dimon. Look at China. The slightest pushback from anyone with power and he slinks away like the coward he is. He only wins when people are scared of him. He and his people are cruel, but they’re also incompetent and simple-minded.

Secondly Congress does not have the power to exercise judicial powers and thus has no authority to delegate the power to issue warrants to ICE officers. These ""warrants"" are effectively delegated bills of attainder, not article III warrants. The constitution requires article III warrants for the seizure of persons , and such warrants shall only be issued upon probable cause, meaning there has to be judicial review, which in these ICE ""warrants"" is simply not the case. Additionally for the executive to intrude in such a way onto the turf of the judiciary raises significant separation of powers concerns, the executive cannot exercise any powers in a court unless it has the permission to do so by the court.",rtft,2025-04-25T10:49:32,12

"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/23/ice-arrested-mexican-immigrant-after-hearing-before-judge-dugan/83233154007/  This is a much more thorough story.   Here's what I could gather:   The immigrant is Edwardo Flores Ruiz, a native of Mexico (30) who was involved in a physical altercation in an apartment. A roommate complained that Ruiz was playing music too loudly, and reportedly Ruiz punched someone 30 times, according to the police report. This is still a middemeanor battery charge.   Ruiz was at a hearing with his public defendant and Judge Dugan and the prosecutor, and they were working out a deal to avoid a trial.   ICE arrived at the courthouse with a warrant (according to Chief Judge Carl Ashley of Milwalkee Co District) for Ruiz. Allegedly ICE entered Judge Duganxs office after having gone through the normal orders of business. They were asked to wait until the end of the hearing, and Dugan directed Ruiz out a ""private hallway"" to the public area on the 6th floor of the courthouse.   I imagine details will be analyzed with excruciating detail going forward.   Here are my thoughts:   1) Yes, these actions are absolutely indicative of fascist governments.    2) Judge Dugan, while having noble intentions, fucked up and should not have tried to lead Ruiz away in a clearly sneaky way. The higher courts have been blocking new deportations to El Salvador, so there's relatively low danger of those worst outcomes for Ruiz.    3) Trump's admin targeting immigrants at hearings in courthouses is a sneaky, dirty play right out of the fascist playbook, particularly when they are targeting defendents with low misdemeanor charges. They *know* their actions muck up the normal legal process and serve to scare accused people away from their hearings, which means less justice and legitimacy while increasing the likelihood of additional law breaking by missing hearings.       4) This is fucking terrifying. MAGA will use this to galvanize support and spread a narrative that Democrats are obstructing justice while Trump and ICE continue to chip away at all legitimacy and due process and independence of the courts.  This is why I do criticize Judge Dugan's decisions. Her actions may even serve to undermine the greater fights at the Supreme Court level. ICE shouldn't be intercepting people at courthouses except those accused and charged with much more heinous crimes than a dumb misdemeanor fistfight, but Judge Dugan may have overplayed a rather weak hand. Ruiz doesn't seem to ""innocent,"" and ICE technically has authority to arrest people, they had a warrant for this one, whereas for others, such as Abrego Garcia, they did not.   This is really fucking bad.",Raise_A_Thoth,2025-04-25T10:31:27,33

"Days 501-515: **National Internet Protocol**  The administration unveiled the ""American Digital Sovereignty Act,"" requiring all internet traffic within the U.S. to pass through government-monitored gateways. The bill mandated that tech companies provide encryption backdoors for national security purposes and implement content monitoring systems to flag ""anti-American sentiment."" Silicon Valley leaders protested, but many ultimately complied rather than lose access to the U.S. market.  Days 516-530: **Automated Border Surveillance System**  The Department of Homeland Security deployed an AI-powered surveillance system along the southern border, using facial recognition, drone patrols, and automated decision-making to identify and track potential migrants. Human rights organizations documented numerous false positives leading to detentions of legal residents and citizens, particularly those of Hispanic descent.  Days 531-540: **Critical Infrastructure Nationalization**  Citing national security concerns, Trump issued Executive Order 14412, effectively nationalizing portions of the telecommunications and energy infrastructure. The government took controlling stakes in several companies deemed ""vital to national security,"" with management remaining ostensibly private but subject to federal directives.  ""These aren't takeovers, they're strategic partnerships,"" declared Commerce Secretary Elon Musk. ""America can't lead the world while relying on compromised technology and foreign energy.""  Days 541-550: **Social Credit Pilot Program**  The administration launched what it called the ""American Patriot Score"" pilot program in five states, integrating data from financial records, social media, criminal history, and ""civic participation"" to generate individual citizen ratings. These scores would determine access to government services, loan approvals, and employment opportunities. Critics called it an American version of China's social credit system.",SULT_4321,2025-04-25T10:54:36,4

"Days 551-565: **Article V Convention Campaign**  With 28 states now under Republican control, the administration began actively promoting the calling of a constitutional convention under Article V. The stated goals included amendments imposing term limits for federal judges, requiring balanced budgets, and defining citizenship rights. Legal scholars warned that once convened, such a convention could potentially rewrite any portion of the Constitution.  Days 566-580: **Executive Privilege Expansion**  Trump issued a sweeping executive order claiming ""absolute executive privilege"" over all communications within the executive branch, including agencies traditionally considered independent. This effectively shielded vast portions of government activity from congressional oversight and public records requests, drawing constitutional challenges that slowly made their way through the courts.  Days 581-590: **""Deep State"" Purge Accelerates**  The administration expanded its efforts to remove career civil servants deemed insufficiently loyal, replacing them with political appointees. The Accountability in Civil Service Act passed by the Republican Congress eliminated traditional protections for thousands of positions, allowing for mass terminations without cause. Government expertise in critical areas deteriorated rapidly as experienced professionals fled.  Days 591-600: **State Secession Rhetoric Emerges**  As federal-state tensions reached unprecedented levels, officials in California, Washington, and Oregon began openly discussing the formation of a ""Pacific States Compact"" that would effectively create a semi-autonomous region.

"I’m sure other Non-Americans like myself are not surprised by any this, but are surprised that many Americans are - like even Americans who knew Trump would ruin America because he’s a fascist pawn of Putin seem to be always saying “omg he’s doing [insert fascist thing] now!? - I always knew he was a wrong’un - man the people who voted for him are so dumb”.  There is no knight in shining armour coming to save anyone, none of your political or legal institutions will ride in last minute and provide some sort of cathartic release - Trump will never likely have any kind narratively satisfying comeuppance or karmic retribution, he’ll die of old age and be replaced by someone younger and smarter before that even has a chance to happen. History will not remember sending people to disappear without a trial and arresting judges actually trying to uphold the law as a one off “oopsie” moment - assuming history ever has a chance to look at these events in any kind truthful light.  There will be no “when this is over I hope we have the equivalent of the Nuremberg trials”. It will not just be over one day - things like these don’t have an expiry date or run out of steam. Just like countries don’t go to war because “something briefly went wrong” - they go to war when the complex array of things that had been keeping the peace eventually fall apart.  He’s won - the people have lost. I just wish the people would take next logical step - a step nearly every older western democratic nation has had to take in its history to ensure some semblance of democracy and freedom over tyranny (actual tyranny - not just “taxation without representation”).  There is no waiting for the right time to act anymore, as the right time act was probably more than 4 years ago. Every day  that passes without something more than shocked expressions will cost America more than just a day in suffering in the long run.",Thrasy3,2025-04-25T11:27:50,3

"Days 601-615: **Central Bank Independence Challenged**  Trump launched a public campaign against the Federal Reserve, accusing it of sabotaging economic growth through interest rate policies. When the Fed Chair refused to comply with White House demands, Trump claimed constitutional authority to directly control monetary policy. Financial markets plummeted amid fears of political interference in central banking.  Days 616-630: **Global Trade Collapse**  The administration imposed blanket tariffs of 50% on all imported goods, ignoring WTO rules and existing trade agreements. Global supply chains collapsed almost overnight as countries retaliated with their own tariffs. Consumer prices soared, with particularly severe impacts on food, medicine, and electronics. Major retailers announced widespread store closures and layoffs.  Days 631-640: **Digital Dollar Manipulation**  The Treasury Department accelerated the rollout of a digital dollar, which Trump announced would have an adjustable exchange rate against foreign currencies. This effective abandonment of market-determined exchange rates sent shockwaves through the global financial system. Several countries announced they would no longer accept dollars for international trade.  Days 641-650: **Asset Seizure Program**  Under the ""Economic Patriots Act,"" the administration began seizing assets of individuals and corporations accused of ""economic sabotage"" - broadly defined to include offshoring jobs, divesting from certain industries, or making investments deemed contrary to national interests.

"*AI Overview*  Yes, Nazis did actively target and, in some cases, arrest judges who were deemed a threat to their ideology or who did not adhere to Nazi principles. This included purging Jewish and Socialist judges and lawyers from the legal system. Additionally, judges who were unwilling to conform to Nazi dictates or who dared to question their authority could face consequences, including dismissal or even arrest.  Here's a more detailed explanation:  *Purging the Judiciary:*   In 1933, one of the earliest antisemitic laws in Nazi Germany involved the removal of Jewish and Socialist judges and lawyers from the legal profession.  *The People's Court:*   The Nazis established the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof) to try political crimes, and it became notorious for its harsh and often unfair trials, leading to the term ""judicial murder,"" according to Wikipedia.  *Restrictions on Independence:*   The Nazi regime gradually eroded the independence of the judiciary, with judges increasingly controlled and expected to follow Nazi directives.  *Judges and the Nazi Regime:*   Some judges actively embraced Nazi ideology and collaborated with the regime, while others resisted but faced severe consequences.  *Consequences for Dissidents:*   Judges who opposed Nazi policies or were deemed politically unreliable could face arrest, imprisonment, or even execution.  *Examples of Arrests:*   The arrest of individuals, including judges, during the ""Night of the Long Knives"" (1934) and in the aftermath of the July 20th assassination plot (1944) illustrates how the regime used its power to target and eliminate perceived threats, including judges who might have sympathized with the plotters.  *Subsequent Nuremberg Trials:*   After the war, prominent Nazi jurists were tried at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials for their involvement in ""judicial murder"" and other atrocities committed under the Nazi regime.",BloweringReservoir,2025-04-25T12:52:00,2

Not going to speak to this specific incident but I think ambushing people who are attending or on their way to attend legal proceedings is a bad idea.   It discourages those  who might be trying to legitimately become a citizen from doing so. It also makes people not want to come to court.   I have no problem with deporting people who are here illegally especially if they have a criminal record. But as with most things regarding this administration the implementation is both heavy handed and borderline illegal.   And we should definitely be trying to get people who may have been here illegally but have jobs and no criminal history on the path to citizenship.   For instance my brother works at a restaurant. One of the long time employees there was deported despite being in the queue (for months) to become legal.,im4vt,2025-04-25T12:48:48,1

In fact, a common strategy for people in that situation is to try to blame their own actions on someone else, say, *I was manipulated, I'm a victim, too!* I totally see them throwing him under the bus.  Yeah, Trump's gonna try turn it up to 11 to try to recover that; I'm not surprised any of this is happening. But these cases will probably be dismissed, too. I think the image of power is *critical* to firing up supporters, too; no, I don't think MAGA will just go away, but I do think the movement is in the process of losing steam.

After allegedly arguing with the ICE team, Dugan sent them to the chief judge's office, the affidavit states. That's when, according to investigators, Dugan ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer into a private area of the courthouse. The affidavit classifies this as unusual because “only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.”",Dramatic-Rutabaga972,2025-04-25T14:13:58,2

We seen it happen since the fall of the Roman republic when the people of Rome started blaming the slaves for taking their jobs during the time of the Grachii brothers, while ironically still worshipping the elites who were the only ones benefiting from slave labor.  It’s interesting to me how we keep repeating the cycle. Sadly when a democracy is so damaged, I’m not sure there even is a way to mend the fractures caused by loss of trust in democratic institutions and abuse of power from the executive branch. At least I can’t really think of any example of that happening in human history, would be curious to see one, could be our blueprint out of this, if not I think it’s already too late. Yup am a doomer, but also nearly everything I’ve said since 2015 has turned out to be true, so maybe just realistic?

After allegedly arguing with the ICE team, Dugan sent them to the chief judge's office, the affidavit states.

FBI asks WTF and she says as so and provides no information on his whereabouts. She is then arrested on obstruction.  This will go no where.

It's this tricky, insidious little shitweasel approach to federal law enforcement where Trump sends the goons to arrest someone, they have a warrant, but then they overstep in legally nuanced way - they try entering the Judge's private office, right, and catch their ""perp"" where he's already a sitting duck, even though they are interfering with a literal active hearing. It's just completely unnecessary, and given the recent patterns to these deportations, it's obvious this is a pattern.    Then they get asked to leave, of course. But now they have this weasel-ey argument that the judge is supposed to just let them come take the guy, but that's not really legal. The Judge can't just detain this person after the end of her own proceedings to work as some bpurred extension of the ICE enforcement apparatus to make it easier for ICE to arrest him. ICE fucked up, and they blame the Judge for not playing along.   MAGA and right-leaning conservatives don'r really care about these formalities and intricacies of law and jurisdictions and roles, they see the Judge as someone who ""let a criminal get away"" or, as the DOJ claims, ""aided a criminal in fleeing ICE.""",Raise_A_Thoth,2025-04-25T12:06:39,5

"The Japanese internments were not conducted pursuant to any immigration law.  They were legally a different thing altogether.  Immigration violations are a civil matter and governed by a body of civil laws within which are interspersed a variety of criminal laws as well (smuggling, aiding and abetting, reentry after deportation, etc).    Some violations may be treated both civilly and criminally, but the vast majority are hadled as civil cases.  Civil immigration violations are generally not a criminal matter. So the way they are viewed under the law is a bit different from a criminal charge.  The most notable difference, of course, is it is the only one in which a someone's person may be seized pending the outcome of the case.  That's why the ""arrest"" warrants are issued by the agency itself (legally it's akin to how the IRS would issue their own seizure order in a civil tax case)   If a civil immigration arrest is made without a warrant there must be probably cause.  The ""civil"" arrest warrant is commonly signed off on by a mid-level agency within 24 hours of the arrest. This is how the law is written and works.  It's nothing new and nobody has just made this up since Trump came into office again.  When I worked the only aliens we had immigration arrest warrants in-hand for were those who had failed to appear at their immigration hearing and been ordered deported in-absentia.  (aka: fugtive cases)    State and local police and other Federal law enforcement agencies conduct probable cause arrests all the time without a warrant.

Perhaps a more effective stance would be organized boycotts of the retailers Trump seems to care about so much. Pressure those companies to put the same effort into protecting the rule of law as they do in protecting against tariffs.  Other countries have been in Trump's crosshairs and have effectively responded with meaningful movements (no USA travel, not buying American, opposing MAGA-style politicians).   There appears to be very little by way of similar efforts by American citizens.

"You don't need to think it, you can know it. Many states, including mine (Colorado) tried out the ""local / state collaborates strongly with ICE"" thing for a while. Several years.

Federal agents have to present a judicial warrant, at which point local can coordinate, but the Feds have to develop the case on their own and local is now available only as backup or extra hands.  Why the about-face? For the reasons you describe - it was preventing people from reporting crimes, cooperating as witnesses, and even from cooperating as victims.

Cynicism is not wisdom, rather it is the cowardly death of it.  I do believe people can and will learn from their mistakes, and there are still many paths to win without violence, but even on this board people keep spouting their opinions loudly without doing any research, some by design as moral opposition no doubt. In fact, it got much worse here last year and led to the exact outcomes and reasons why Trump won.  There was 0 justication for ever allowing him back into power. Any reason to ever even consider it was just wrong. You can think we're too soft on immigration, or that prices are too high, or that the US is too pro-Israel, or that Biden was too old, or too timid, or even corrupt...  None of those reasons meant Trump was the solution, ever. Voting for him was effectively national suicide. The man was wholly unqualified for office.

If everyone who’s been protesting was able to be in the same area, it would be millions gathered. But it doesn’t have the same visual impact when we’re so spread out.   The media also isn’t covering the protests because they’re bending the knee to Trump— so they’re also not getting the attention that they should & like we saw in 2020.   The reality is that even if Trump himself is gone, the Republican Party is in control. There’s a line of succession and it would just go to JD Vance and then to Mike Johnson— and they’re all in step with each other and would not be an improvement at all.

It is going to take extreme organization to bring enough people together to send a message that politicians here will care about.  Local protests are all but meaningless, in my view, because it's easy for a politician or company to ignore such a small group of people.  It also doesn't help that the main stream media has been captured by oligarchs.  It's hard to build public momentum when your only avenue for getting a message out is hoping that the algorithm brings your message to the masses.  You have multiple different groups of people each individually organizing small groups of people instead of working together to build the biggest possible group.  There is no such thing as local news anymore, newspapers are all owned by giant companies, local news stations are all owned by giant companies.    During Trump's last tenure, I called and wrote my representatives almost every day and not once did I receive a response, and not once did I see that have any impact on how they voted.  The system has been completely broken for a long time now,   Unfortunately, it's not as easy as just protesting anymore.

Removing Due Process is exactly why this whole thing is happening.,XennaNa,2025-04-25T11:53:03,6
"So, technically, anyone can be arrested and held for up to a few days without charges being brought up. The rationale is that the legal system is so complex that it affords prosecutors a few days to go over the initial evidence and police department recommendations (along with any possible statements and witness accounts collected) in order to determine what is the most apt and appropriate charges to bring forth at the start. All of this is exactly a part of due process. If within 72 hours the state fails to bring charges to the courts (for whatever reason), the person can be let go. They of course can be re-arrested later on when the state puts up charges at any time within the statute of limitations (if applicable). Remember, it's not the police charging someone with a crime, it's the prosecutor's department that does that. Sometimes, cops will arrest someone for what they think is a crime, but either there's not enough evidence to even bring up a charge, or the officers were misguided about the law and the prosecutor's department doesn't bring up a charge and the person is then released (rare as fuck, once in jail, usually both the police and state are going to find at least something to charge you with).",Raus-Pazazu,2025-04-25T11:26:27,3

"I agree with you. But in the past, there was some semblance of accountability from our politicians that we just don’t have anymore. Many elected officials now act as if they’re beholden to the president or to their party rather than to their constituents. They used to have a vested interest in listening to voters because they needed us to be re-elected. But now, for one entire party of legislators, all that matters for their political careers is that they don’t step out of line with the president. We used to have politicians who, while some may have been terrible people, still had an incentive to operate within the confines of what is acceptable and legal. There was some interest in maintaining civility, and now we have a president who is actively encouraged division and unrest. It used to be that you could disagree with those in power, you could protest and organize and stand up for what you believe in, and there was a chance that negotiation could be on the table. At the very least, you would not be met with cruel, callous threats and targeted authoritarianism. There was someone reasonable on both sides, even if they only had the slightest moral compass.  (Please note that I am NOT disregarding situations in our nation’s history where people have fought for what they believe in and been jailed, abused, killed. Countless Americans in our history have demonstrably stood up for what they believe in. They just weren’t fighting against an openly fascistic administration. Change was not easy, but it was still *possible*.)  There was a standard, some sense of decorum or diplomacy, and now the bottom has fallen out.  Our system of checks and balances among the three branches of government is also failing. The judicial branch has attempted to keep the executive branch in check, but they are simply defying those court orders. This is not something that has ever happened here before.

So when they tried to do this, the Judge asked them to wait outside, according to the report I shared. They did not share the warrant with this Judge, so she was unaware of it, according to what we know so far.    Is she supposed to end her hearing with this individual and then tell them to stay there - effectively detaining him *for ICE* - while she then summons ICE? That's not her jurisdiction, it's not the job of a Judge.  Seriously, this is why what ICE is trying to do is so fucked up. They are intentionally blurring these boundaries between the Judicial branch and the Executive.   They could have waited at the exits of the building.

\>Its like how the IRS traditionally doesnt sic the DOJ on people reporting income from illegal sources  I'm glad you brought this up because one of the most shocking things in the tax world recently has been the announcement that IRS will start sharing information with ICE.   The IRS has a very successful program of allowing non-citizens to file and receive a FTIN a federal tax identification number. This is a good program because it allows people regardless of status in this country to legally work and legally pay taxes. It is also been a fairly important part of any comprehensive immigration system. You would think conservatives would \*want\* immigrants to be paying taxes. This move raises a lot of concern that it will scare away tax filings as a result.,Good_old_Marshmallow,2025-04-25T13:56:40,3

">Its like how the IRS traditionally doesnt sic the DOJ on people reporting income from illegal sources;          I'm not an expert on taxes or tax law, but as far as I am aware, people are supposed to list their illegal gains under ""other income"".   I don't think there's a specific need to itemize the crimes you committed to get the income. If the IRS has reasonable suspicion that you're doing specific crime, they very well may report you to the DoJ, it's just that they're not going to investigate everything that may or may not be illegal.      The incentive to report criminal income is that if the feds can't get you for the crime itself, they can get you for tax evasion and then give you the maximum penalties. It's easy to demonstrate that you could somehow afford to buy  expensive things while not having a commensurate reported income and no assets to explain how you can afford anything.",Bakoro,2025-04-25T13:28:40,2

They discussed the details of the planned arrest, including in which courtroom Flores-Ruiz was set to appear. The sergeant asked that any arrest wait until after the completion of the scheduled hearing before Judge DUGAN. As this was standard practice, Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A agreed, and they were allowed to proceed unescorted to the public hallway outside of Courtroom 615.   > Before Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A arrived outside of Courtroom 615, FBI agents A and B had advised the courtroom deputy for Courtroom 615 that law enforcement was there to arrest Flores-Ruiz. FBI Agent A displayed his credentials to the courtroom deputy and informed him that they were there to assist ICE in arresting Flores-Ruiz. They agreed that the arrest would take place after Flores-Ruiz’s court appearance. The agents then left the courtroom and took positions at different locations in the public hallway.  > The courtroom deputy explained that at approximately 8:15 am, FBI agents advised that they were working with ICE and were planning to arrest Flores-Ruiz.

"A passage from ""They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45"", an interview with a German after WWII.  > Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to “go out of your way to make trouble.” Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.  > Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, “everyone” is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, “It’s not so bad” or “You’re seeing things” or “You’re an alarmist.”  > And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  > But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  > But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the “German Firm” stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  > And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying “Jewish swine,” collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  > Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood.

The US Adminstrative state was engineered in a way to allow for dissent of flagrantly illegal orders. I grew up in a multi-generational military family and even I know that “I was following orders” isn’t a real legal defense. And definitely isn’t a moral one. The FBI Agents should be arrested and held within the state until such that the Federal Government ceases its attacks on the judiciary. By abandoning their oath for fealty to the administration they have made themselves pawns in Trumps overarching goals and sadly the lesson many have to learn the hard way and that’s the President doesn’t like war hero’s who were captured. The administration sees them as tools that can be discarded when no longer having utility. Society can’t spend more time taking care of the people who fell for the regime and actively aided its most disgusting policies instead of the people actually being hurt by this.   They don’t get pitty points, when they are also on every channel telling us empathy is weakness.

There was one activist from the Phillipines who said that in the early days of the Duterte takeover, she was arrested on ""suspicion of tax evasion"" five times, fought it five times, won five times. Meanwhile, Duterte was pushing the ""journalists are criminals"" narrative on social media.  Even in states like China, you don't actually get charged with ""criticising the government."" The charge is something like ""inciting public unrest"" if your criticism of the government goes viral.  The point isn't whether the charge sticks or not.

If the person commits a real crime (i.e. not just crossing the border or overstaying a visa) then you have a trial for the crime and if they are guilty and they are not citizens then they get deported.   How do people not see that if you don't give every person due process, then ANYONE, including citizens, can be disappeared into a foreign prison with no recourse.

"There's a danger here. A really important problem.  You are convinced that white Americans are turning their back on black america. More than that, they are dismissive and even scared of black people.  I have to believe there are a lot of Americans (not just white) who believe just as you have said. But the problem here is that such a view, even if true about a sizable portion, is fervently racist.   Just because my birth parents are white doesn't make me turn my back on the cruelty inflicted on our black neighbors. Just because my skin is lighter than yours does not make me dismissive of BLM and it does not mean that I am scared of black people.  I could try to prove I am none of those things. I could bring up what I've done, how I've protested, try to prove to you that I am not racist, nor frightened (which would be racist too). But if you want me to keep fighting for justice you need to stop judging me by the color of my skin. Because when you do I AM afraid. Racism is dehumanization and anyone so reduced becomes a target for someone unleashing their rage and frustration.  If you can, try not to make sweeping statements about an entire group of people. Don't alienate us. Give us opportunities to help. Welcome us to the cause. Not all of us will.  Some of us are despicable racists, some of us don't care, some are too busy struggling to keep their family fed, safe and healthy. But some of us have the wherewithal to stand with our beautiful dark skinned brothers and sisters and keep fighting for a world where caliber is not based on color and righteousness is not based on race.  i don't have answers for how to fix all this. I don't know what these pissed off judges are going to do. But they're going to do SOMETHING. And we are going to do SOMETHING too.

"Actually, from a scientific perspective, you are wrong. Implicit bias is real, even among people who aren’t explicitly racist…even among people that work hard to try and do the right thing, as you seem to do. If you can’t acknowledge that, then you’ll never understand the experiences of poc, the real impact of systemic racism, and what needs to happen in order to create a more equitable society. In order to fix the problem of racism, it must be acknowledged that in order to survive as the tribal species that we are, humans are evolutionarily wired to have biases, including racial biases.  You want me to understand your experience and perceived fear, yet you are dismissive of mine. You mentioned your fear in response to my words, yet dismiss my real and constant experiences that cause my feelings and beliefs. If you were open to hearing about my experience, you’d be aware that I grew up in the deep south, around explicit racists. My peers were literally the children of KKK members. I was first called the n word (hard r) and given racist KKK pamphlets to read as a six year old. But, what I noticed throughout my life, was that the extreme and explicitly racist whites weren’t called out by the rest, but included and accepted much more easily than me or others with darker skin. That is the same pattern that plays out today. Many whites could acknowledge a bias in policing, yet stopped short of supporting any type of meaningful reform, or even fighting it.  I acknowledge that there are white allies. Yet, as poc have been fighting for decades, those few allies have been far too small to affect the beliefs of the majority and create any meaningful change.

"I think somehow you aren't really reading what I'm writing, and perhaps that's true the other way, and maybe that lack of understanding speaks to the root of the problem.  I'm not quite sure how I gave the impression that I was dismissive of anything you said, let alone the evil that is racism. Racism is license to stop seeing the individual and instead see a target for hate and violence. It is evil in the worst sense because it is both banal and brutal. It is the contradiction of our basic humanity.  These discussions can lapse into a tit for tat comparison between which party has suffered the most. I don't want to do that. To compare racism i have encountered in my life to racism against POC is ludicrous. Even from the outside, what I have seen and fought against tells me that although I can try to understand the black experience, it is too fundamental, too central, too inhumane, too cruel, to ignorant, too all encompassing for me to ever really understand it. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try, which I do and in fact am trying to do right now   That wasn't the point of my reply. My point was to call you out on your own racism. Not all whites are the same. Not be a long shot. I have hatred for whites who have hurt my black friends (and LGBTQ friends, but that's a different story) but I don't hate ALL white people. That would be absurd. I've also known more that a few complete black skinned assholes, including one first name Y who used to beat on me first through sixth grade when I finally bluffed him out at a high-profile showdown in the school parking lot (and Thank God, it worked - that MF would have killed me). But not all black people are dicks, and I recognize no internal racism to black people (except possibly if you are male and your name begins with a Y, but that's pretty rare). In fact my experiences with black culture have been overwhelmingly positive to the point where I tend to seek out POC as friends and potential mates. So do I carry bias? Of course I do. We all do. But that bias is both positive and negative and as you said, an unavoidable part of being human. We just can't let it go unexamined and unreined.  My takeaway point here is that if there is not room for whites as active on the ground supporters of BLM and POC rights in general then the best we can do is provide feeble assistance from outside the circle. If there is a sense that we will only be seen by the color of our skin and will become a focal point of anger and frustration if we show up to a rally then we probably won't go. Any sentence that starts ""White people..."" alienates all of us. It reinforces the barrier you are trying to break down.  As for at least trying anything isn't good enough? Of course it's not. But it's not clear to me what the most effective means of changing the system are. And I don't think it's clear to you either. Standing by and being angry and hoping that people see the light and stop acting like reprehensible human beings doesn't seem to work.   So I stand by what I said.  All I know is that the way things are now is not acceptable. Change has to happen and our worst enemy is paralysis and apathy. We need to be willing to try and know we will fail until we succeed. Because BLM marches tend to only honor the people who already feel that way, and speeches are only good if they're heard by the people who don't listen to them. The POC need a lot more people in their cause across all races and orientations, because otherwise the us-versus-them mentality is just going to cause gridlock and perhaps you and I will both agree that the movement has been stuck in gridlock, stagnating or reversing, for far too long.

There are multiple stories about how ICE is specifically denying people due process. They have been all over this sub and are easily googled.,Despair-Envy,2025-04-25T20:42:52,1
">  Are you asserting that the warrant was issued for a different reason than outlined in the affidavit  Yes. I am asserting that I have reason to doubt that ICE would be truthful. They have proven repeatedly that they call anyone with brown skin ""Illegal"" and detain them for days/weeks, if not deport them as they have done to at least dozens of legal US residents and citizens.  > The warrant would imply that a judge found the affidavit credible enough for arrest.  Nope, that's a different type of warrant. ICE can issue itself an ""Administrative warrant"", no judge required.",Despair-Envy,2025-04-25T20:25:20,1

"The problem with saying its not the majority is that we honestly have no way to know. I have no particular way or reason to give them the benefit of the doubt in the situation, they've been shown to act in bad faith and illegally too often.   Maybe I'm more cynical then is justified to some, but I find that there are far more unhealthy positions to be in then being overly cynical of the Trump administration. There's a reason why experts and historians on the subjects of fascism and authoritarianism are fleeing the country and why more and more countries, political leaders and experts are openly saying the country is no longer a liberal democracy.

I mean. That's kind of the rub. There's no reason to reliably believe that they will give the alien due process. They've repeatedly snubbed the courts by explicitly refusing to give them due process and deporting them in the face of stays and orders not to.
