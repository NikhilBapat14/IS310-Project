Pardon my ignorance but why does he have this obsession with autism?,palinsafterbirth,2025-04-30T14:02:02,39
"> “Every child who gets measles gets a headline,” Kennedy said during the visit alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. “When I was kid, there were 2 million measles cases a year and nobody wrote about them.”  Maybe the worm ate the part of his brain containing his memories of this, but when RFK Jr. was a kid, the measles vaccine was introduced and rapidly took the number of cases from millions every single year to mere hundreds over the span of 10 years in the 2000s. People absolutely did write about measles then, but millions of cases wasn't as notable because it was the norm. The norm now is practically nothing, so for there to be such a big surge in cases that eclipses last year's measles total is extremely alarming. Especially when an anti-vaxxer with no medical background is in charge of public health.",FlufumOzei,2025-04-30T14:32:57,12

"I hate that someone infected me with diabetes! Wait, no, it was after spending over 40 years as hypoglycemic (meaning I was producing WAY too much insulin) to the point where my body became resistant to it and I now require a shot every day.   I hate that someone infected me with Tourette Syndrome! No, wait, it was something I inherited from my father and, sadly, passed on to my daughter.  I hate that someone infected me with Von Willebrand disorder! No, wait, that's another gentic disorder that's been around for centuries.  I hate that someone infected me with Anxiety! No, that's from dealing with idiots like RFK who claim chronic illnesses didn't exist in the past.  Autism existed, it just wasn't diagnosed. Just like people with Down Syndrome, families denied their existance and left them to institutions or locked them up out of shame. Remember the lobotomy that was performed on his sister for not being ""normal"" in that family's eyes. And why does he act like he had one as well.  Measles, smallpox, Whooping cough, etc, can be prevented with a shot. The stuff he's railing against can't. Yet he claims cures are the problem. Personally, I'd prefer an autistic child to a dead child.",kittyhm,2025-04-30T22:41:40,2

"As OP said, some people just can't get vaccinated. On top of that, even vaccinated people can get infected. The chance is low, but it's there. Once herd immunity is gone (even just in patches of the country) and the virus is spreading, it runs the risk of mutating. More infections means more chances of mutation. So a virus that was once considered eliminated in the U.S. is now on the brink of coming back for absolutely no reason at all apart from bad governing.
