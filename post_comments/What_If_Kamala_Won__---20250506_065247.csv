"What is 100 days? A day is 24 hours, right? So you take your day, those 24 hours, and multiply it by 100 and you've got 2,400 hours. So in those 2,400 hours we will have experienced 100 days. And that is very important, ""experienced"". Because that is the way we perceive things, we experience them and in so experiencing 2,400 hours, well not all 2,400, we've got to sleep and we're not really experiencing anything when we sleep, so in those waking hours the ""day"" part of day, we would be working toward 100 of those and making those 100 the most productive of days we could possibly hope to have.",cossbobo,2025-05-06T16:54:05,7
