"Dems must adopt a progressive economic populist message that undercuts the divisive rhetoric of putting various working class groups against each other, and resoundingly pointing the finger at the ultra-rich.  In my view there is a 4 step process to fix this country:  1) Obstruct, Resist, Impede, Observe, Document this administration, and Sound the Alarm Bells — bring awareness to the ignorant and apathetic.    Realistically, impede at every turn can at least slow things down or at best buy time until we can get to an election — and we have to assume elections will be viable until that's proven not to be the case.  Any hour you distract Trump and this administration and grind them down in litigation and blocking streets, or diverting attention to some online fight, the less damage they can do to the American people.   Ideally, larger protests movements like 50501 in unison with Democratic leadership (lol, I know) would coordinate red lines that are predictably coming but have yet to be crossed and then define a clear action plan should this line be crossed. This (1) Becomes a threat to the administration, and (2) Will yield an immediate response proportional to the act. That might include a General Strike, for example. If people know ahead of time, then they can plan and coordinate.  2) Reshape the Democratic party into a banner willing to fight. That means getting charismatic, authentic candidates with progressive economic populist messages that undercut the identity politics they seek to distract us with and turn it into a class fight of the rich vs. the poor. Call out the rich directly for stealing the entire pie and pitting us against each other to fight for the crumbs.  3) Take this newfound banner and reach out to working-class Trump supporters and Couch sitters.   4) If you can reach criticality in the level of 60-70% support, you then go state-by-state and put in major Constitutional reforms both at the state level Constitutions, and Federal — addressing executive overreach, judicial stagnation, inequality, campaign finance, and election reform.  Of course we don't know if we are past the point of no return; if elections will still be a thing come next year's midterms. But we have no choice but to assume they will happen until proven otherwise. Moreover we must seize on this moment where Trump's approval ratings are historically low.",Independent-Bug-9352,2025-05-10T12:15:37,1

"If billionaires are using the government to steal money, then the obvious solution would be to run the government as small and lean as possible and adjust taxes down to reflect that. They can't user the government to steal money if the government doesn't have the money in the first place.  The Federal government is too big. Big enough that it can't be properly monitored, controlled, and held accountable. We see it now with all the ways Trump has broken the law and gotten away with it.  I've thought for a while now - if people are so afraid of what Trump can do with the power of the Presidency, the problem isn't just Trump. It's that the office of the Presidency, and the government it runs, has too much power in the first place.  Move everything that can be moved down the State level. Don't even have to cut it. Just get it out of the hands of the Federal government. It makes no sense that I pay the vast majority of my income tax to a far away Federal government that I have less representation in.

"What I don’t understand about that lawsuit and defence is that regardless of what a “reasonable”person would do, millions of people do and continue to believe what Fox News says. They did at the time of the lawsuit and they still do today. So how is that a successful defense against spreading misinformation? Why are dumb people allowed to be misled?

Make them realize they are us and the billionaires are them.    It is a very easy way to win this fight cause we don’t even need to change their general readiness for in group out group sort of decision making.

I definitely think Trump and Elon are racist as hell. My dad keeps saying, ""He doesn't really believe that"" right after watching them say otherwise. The inconsistency makes my head explode.

"True, though I was moreso referring to personal income and even business earnings for tax not always net worth as that value is almost never liquid, I understand that. Though many of these folks also have self owned business setup and that can get a bit dirty at times but I'm speaking more earnings. We see how accountants make tricks happen where you can 'legally' get away with paying next to no taxes, even a few thousand, when you may be earning 40x+ over an average salary. They shouldn't get to pay less just because they had some loss that year, because in the grand scheme of things you end up paying less than the average American due to accounting tricks that are 'legal'-ish.  My concern being that it may take nearly the whole population of the US to play these same accounting tricks before it fixes the system for all (I fully recognize on the business side especially its not all black and white).  TLDR - Individual income earnings need to be taxed appropriately so that the rest of us aren't paying more than the ultra wealthy. This isn't a set price for taxes, but the rich guy gets a discount because he knows a guy.",nicksteron,2025-05-10T14:23:13,1
"The problem is these people and not Fox. They'll find some other fear-inducing liar to which they can glue their eyes and ears. The problem is their beliefs and values are so hyper-compartmentalized, they can simultaneously deride lies and liars, be incredibly upset if you ever suggest they or someone they trust is a liar, while also ignoring the blatant lies they enjoy believing. You can show them the folly of their actions, and the unpleasant sensation of being wrong gets tucked away somewhere deep in their subconscious the moment the conversation ends. Trump is a known liar, a criminal, a rapist, a pedo, a thief, a conman, basically everything except ""illegal immigrant"" for which these people espouse deep hatred.   At the end of the day, they want to *feel* like good people on the right side of history. But to actually figure out where that right side is and to *be* a good person require actual work and a level of acknowledged uncertainty that goes against their faith-based rationale. Instead, they simply *are* good people, by virtue of being them. Anything they or their favored celebrities do must be justifiable, because they're inherently good people. And anything the ""other"" does must be bad, because they are bad people by virtue of not being like them.   Fox News just exploits this dynamic by providing these people vindication and cover. To put it succinctly, we have a problem in this country of really dumb people trying really hard to avoid facing their own stupidity.",Michael_G_Bordin,2025-05-10T13:30:08,1

"I think trying to teach racists who hate poor people not to be racist and hate poor will never happen.  I think it is a losing battle to try to convince some white church going 55 year old racist poor hating Republican woman not to hate poor lgbt brown people.   That’s not the way to votes.      They like a bull in a china shop.  The correct thing to do is channel their hate.   Wave a red flag in the right direction at the right time to direct the bull.  Their hatred can be an asset if channeled.    Instead of convincing them not to hate certain people, just whip up their hatred for the right people and naturally their race and poor people hate subsides.      We need to not convince them that they don’t hate poor people, but rather remind them that they are poor themselves relative to billionaires.     Basically we need to do the inverse of what the technofascist do.   The technofascists didn’t convince them to love all billionaires, they simply convinced us to hate everyone but billionaires to the benefit of billionaires.
