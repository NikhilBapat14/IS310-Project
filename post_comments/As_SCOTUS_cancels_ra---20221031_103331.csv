"Probably not.  First of all, in CA, affirmative action is already illegal (for public schools). So nothing happening in the Bay Area has anything to do with affirmative action.  If this was not in CA, then still no.  Canceling a test-based admissions program and replacing it with a lottery (as happened at Lowell) eliminates all forms of discrimination (positive, negative, or otherwise) from admissions. A test-based admissions system intentionally discriminates on the basis of test scores; that's what it is designed to do.  It might be easier to make an argument about a budget decision favoring one group over another (that's what canceling advanced math is. It's a decision to fund some other program instead), but the politics of that would look really bad (you would have to argue that advanced math courses inherently benefit white and Asian students), and implementing a ruling like that would be impossible. Every budget ever made favors some group over another. If anything that incidentally benefits one racial group can be budgeted for, nothing can be budgeted for.",loselyconscious,2022-11-04T03:07:06,3
I googled this and nothing came up. Did this really happen as you say it did?,dunpyklungo,2022-11-04T06:56:08,1
The SF Chronicle article on the SF school board math cancellation debacle is pay walled. But here's a good article from a SF peninsula math professional who outlines the issues in balanced way IMO.  https://eduissues.com/2021/03/27/the-local-math-wars-begin-again/,redzeusky,2022-11-04T10:10:39,1
I’m not sure he actually explains what you’re talking about. At the very top of the article it says the board is not getting rid of complex math classes?,dunpyklungo,2022-11-05T15:50:33,1
"After the parents went ballistic the school board temporarily allowed 8th grade algebra to continue. But the while continued to work on cancelling it making a uniform 6th grade math and 8th grade math because they felt it was not ""equitable"" for some students (mostly Asian BTW) to be able to work ahead. They had the scare word ""tracking"" associated with accelerate math. If they want to help the bring everyone up that's fine. But dumbing down the program so everyone feels similarly about their math potential is ridiculous and abusive to talented math students who get stuck with work sheets on stuff they learned long ago.",redzeusky,2022-11-05T20:30:31,0
I’m not sure I follow. Did it actually end up happening or not? Did they eliminate accelerated math courses?,dunpyklungo,2022-11-06T15:23:49,1
