"Even trump stepped down in 2028, his influences on US would still be lasting for the next 20 years. Because he literally appointed 1/3 of the SCOTUS judges, and the scary part is maybe he can appoint more before 2028. And more federal court judges would be appointed by him too, and half of federal judges can be ended up MAGA.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T18:34:35,1

Gotta save a sardonic thanks for Biden throwing a huge wrench in the works by digging his claws into a second campaign when he was too old.  Oh and also for having Merrick Garland prepare a damning report only to throw it to the wind on his way out.,atzucach,2025-04-07T18:25:23,1
The ruling also requires that the deportee be able to have a hearing to challenge the deportation. The government is explicitly no longer allowed to deport without the ability to challenge the order in court.,jaunty411,2025-04-07T19:19:45,1

"Sure, except that Roberts also just ruled that there’s no remedy against the government if they ignore all of that and deport someone against the law. So, sure “they have to have a hearing”, but “we won’t make you do anything even if you ignore us.” Like everything with Roberts, it’s more than just the instant case that looks reasonable, it’s the trajectory: the Court inserting itself in historically early ways when it benefits Trump, then making sure that there aren’t any consequences even when Trump blatantly ignores the law and takes a shit on the Constitution.",DemandredG,2025-04-07T19:48:15,1
