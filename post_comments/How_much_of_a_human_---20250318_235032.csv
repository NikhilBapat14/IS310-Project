"Yes, the Trump administration's deportation of over 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador without proof of criminal guilt is a blatant violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Constitution is crystal clear: **no person**—citizen or not—shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Deporting individuals without trial or credible evidence of guilt flies in the face of this fundamental protection. Deporting individuals without presenting evidence or conducting trials screams authoritarianism. ICE admitting that some of these people had no criminal records makes it even more egregious. This sets a dangerous precedent. If the government can trample constitutional protections for one group today, it can justify doing so to others tomorrow. This isn’t just about Venezuelans—it’s about how far a government is willing to go when the Constitution becomes an inconvenience.  This isn’t just authoritarian creep—it’s a full-on sprint toward it. If this behavior is normalized, the ""land of the free"" might find itself on the fast track to becoming a land of arbitrary rule.",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-19T00:15:57,166

The trump regime deported the migrants without any evidence of their crimes. It misapplied the statute that was meant for war time. The entire episode was performative but it will appeal to a small slice of MAGAs. Of course trump will lie about it but a court will make him provide evidence.
