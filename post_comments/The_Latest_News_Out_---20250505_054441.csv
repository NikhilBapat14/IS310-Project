"According to a new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to the present, indicating that in some years, gains have outweighed losses  We only have 30 years of being able to measure the Antarctic gain and loss and somehow we think we know exactly how it works? For all we know it is a normal contraction and expansion of the ice for centuries and nothing to do with man at all.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:36:49,27
"Never let a crisis go to waste, and when there isn't one, manufacture it.   Now they'll blame global warming for the precipitation that caused the increase in ice. Smh",social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T07:44:21,13

Just realized I’m in my 7th decade of so called climate crisis. How long before people wake up to the lie.,Reaganson,2025-05-05T10:35:58,2
In 10 years they will be locking down the population and trying to tax us to death under the excuse of “we need to warm the planet!!”,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-05T07:20:07,1

The same applies to all temp data used for predictive models,spezeditedcomments,2025-05-05T09:44:09,14
"It's nearly like its impossible with the current age of our monitoring technology to separate short term weather effects from natural long term climate effects from human induced climate effects.   The good news is if you start from the conclusion and work backwards you don't have to. Warmer = human altered climate, cooler = short term weather, and natural climate changes don't happen.",_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-05T10:24:31,-5

"I’ve said this for some time.  If/when the narrative changes to “global cooling”, they’ll freak out and start wanting to dump CO2 into the atmosphere to attempt to counteract it.  Then they’ll also claim that people in cold climates are being discriminated against.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-06T13:58:04,1
"Also there was a new process in nature discovered.   Photomolecular Effect.  The photomolecular effect is a phenomenon where light alone can cause water to evaporate without the need for heat. This effect was discovered by researchers at MIT and is analogous to the photoelectric effect. It occurs when light strikes the water-air interface, causing water molecules to cleave off and evaporate directly, bypassing the conventional requirement of thermal energy to break hydrogen bonds between water molecules.  NO heat needed and it evaporates water faster than thermal...  * **Efficiency**: Compared to thermal evaporation, which requires energy to break the bonds between water molecules, photomolecular evaporation is more efficient. It can exceed the thermal evaporation limit, which is the maximum evaporation rate achievable with a given amount of heat.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T10:17:45,9
"No it isn't. You simply accept that your sample is less than 1% of the whole worlds time of climate.    150 years of accurate temperature data compared to millions of years.   30 years of antarctic ice size compared to millions of years.   40 years of arctic ice measurement compared to millions of years.  Then add things like Photomolecular effect which we didn't know about till last year that cause evaporation.  Not to mention that the Climate Change scientists start with a Theory and throw out any facts that might invalidate it. Completely opposite of scientific method. You start with a theory and if the facts ALL the facts don't support it, then you work on a new theory, not change the name. I remember the Time article about how the earth was going to freeze soon. The suddenly in 10 years it was global warming.   Also any scientist that says the science is settled is a shill or at best dishonest.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T12:53:35,3

"https://news.mit.edu/2024/how-light-can-vaporize-water-without-heat-0423  I guess if you binarily (made up word) look at light as a mass/mass less conundrum, the mass alone can cleave off stuff, we know particles destroy other bonds all the time.",spezeditedcomments,2025-05-05T10:25:45,-2
"Light is not always heat, but it can produce heat when absorbed by a material. When light is absorbed, the energy from the photons is converted into vibrational energy of the atoms in the material, which we perceive as heat. However, not all light is converted into heat; some can be reflected or transmitted without causing a temperature increase.  It is very very interesting.  The photomolecular effect does not produce heat in the traditional sense where thermal energy is involved. Instead, it describes a process where light can cause water to evaporate directly without the need for heat. Researchers at MIT observed that when green light was shone on a hydrogel containing water, the water evaporated at a rate that exceeded what could be explained by thermal energy alone.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T10:26:30,4
The article supports my statements. I was only talking about evaporation and how it isn't just heat that does it. Not sure what you are trying to say about my comment otherwise.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T12:56:23,2
