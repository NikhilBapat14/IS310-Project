"When Moran explained that the letters “MS-13” [were digitally added to the images](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/apr/30/donald-trump/trump-abrego-garcia-hand-tattoos-abc-news/) Trump was referencing, the former president lost his cool. In perhaps the most revealing moment of the exchange, Trump literally demanded that Moran abandon journalistic integrity and just lie: “Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes, he does,’ and, you know, go on to something else?”",Murky-Site7468,2025-05-01T08:29:03,240
"The media has never had a spine when dealing with Trump.  There's so many times they could have nailed him and didn't.  When he rants about something being communist, ask him to define communism, I bet he couldn't.  Press him why he can't name a single country from the list of 200 he claimed he made deals with.  Ask him how much a gallon of milk costs.  Press him to answer what they actually asked instead of his verbal diarrhea.",BluWake,2025-05-01T08:30:37,148

Even then he had a reputation for constant lying, and got called out for it. It was still not the highest building.  This is also the same person that took out a full page ad in 1989. Solely because he wanted more death penalties, and already considered all people of colors as criminals. The people he targeted were also proven innocent.  The thing about being a PoS and being old.

Second, whether or not that's an MS-13 gang tattoo has nothing to do with the added script. Either it's a gang rat or it isn't.

"In order:  1) Whether or not the courts are going to be to enforce the order that he be returned or if they will allow the executive to ignore them.   2) If he is returned if he's actually going to get the due process that he and others are entitled to and what that will look like. The courts have issued a number of rulings requiring the executive to do various things before they deport anyone else. So far they've resisted complying.   3) Assuming he is returned and actually gets any due process, f he's deportable or not.   4) Is the AEA constitutional?   5) If so, does it apply?  6) If he's deportable, if there is a country we can legally deport him to?  Please note that whether or not he's MS13 is not relevant to most of those. Perhaps 5, if by some miracle the courts uphold the AEA. Perhaps 6 if prior court finding that he might face retaliation in his home country holds up. But legally it's largely irrelevant and we have to overcome a couple legitimate constitutional crises to even get there. His fucking knuckle tattoos should be so far down on the list of things that intelligent people care about that it's fucking annoying to see people wasting time on it. Especially when it just tends to make everyone involved, including the people claiming his deportation is based on ""doctored"" photos, look like idiots that don't understand what's really at issue. It's absurd.",Talondel,2025-05-01T20:33:27,-2

Better to make your point and move on. Moran, got the point across to anyone who is not part of the MAGA cult that Trump is a deranged old man with a feeble grasp on reality who should be in an institution talking to the plants, not in the White House talking to journalists. I'd be surprised if anyone in two minds about Trump, after watching this performance, didn't come away thinking we must have been insane to have voted this man into the most powerful job in the world, and he should be removed ASAP.
