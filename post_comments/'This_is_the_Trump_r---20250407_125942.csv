"Job losses are already happening. The jobless rate went from 4.0 to 4.2 that means about 300,000 more jobs were lost than created",Miri5613,2025-04-07T13:09:51,14
"This feels like the 1980s coming, like when I was kid. Food banks , government cheese, unemployment lines, soup kitchens full of regular ppl. High int rates, everybody tried to save a nickel if they could.",catsoncrack420,2025-04-07T13:25:21,13

Ontop of fed & fed-adjacent job losses.   We should also mention that a good number of the jobs listed as available by these large corporations are not actually real.   I hate how blatant corporate corruption has become.,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-07T14:29:35,3
"That is for sure because companies are not going to hire in this environment and if stock market losses get worse, they will downsize.  My business is tied to the securities markets and calls, emails and texts have slowed considerably.",metskyfan,2025-04-08T11:24:01,2
"Except the interest rates were through the roof to try to slow spending.  This time it's not spending, it's stupidity and I don't think the Fed has the right silver bullet to bring that to heel.  I think Trump would love them to take the interest rate to zero or lower (he loves cheap debt, you know).  There is some talking point running around far right circle suggesting this is a 4D move to refinance the interest on the national debt by causing a recession or depression.  I know we do do things like that fairly often to soften the cost of the debt.  I have never seen anyone try to save money by causing a global recession though.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-07T13:46:10,8
