"The direct mortality rate from measles is just under 3%, so for every million cases there will be almost 30,000 deaths. One of the most dangerous complications of measles is that it resets all prior immunities gained against previous diseases, including vaccine immunity to various diseases, meaning  the risk of death from reinfections by diseases is significantly higher.   One of the more horrible complications of measles is SSPE, with up to 11 cases per 100,000 measles cases. SSPE is a nearly 100% lethal brain disease whose symptoms greatly mimic rabies, with no known treatments. Like rabies, the only thing that SSPE patients can be offered is palliative care while they die. At least 4 cases per 100K measles infections means for every million measles cases between 40 and 110 will die the horrible death of SSPE. The mean delay for SSPE symptoms to onset is 7 years, so all measles survivors who think they're out of the woods have to think about experiencing some clumsiness, foggy thoughts, etc, years later as possibly being the onset of SSPE. Vaccination lowers the risk of SSPE from as high as 11 per 100K down to 0.7 per 1M.",noncongruent,2025-04-24T11:33:56,15
Really dodged a bullet being born in the 80's. My MAGA parents would have almost certainly not allowed me to get the required vaccinations.,WhaleFactory,2025-04-24T11:26:26,9

Maybe if we spin it like one of the plagues from the Bible they’ll start getting vaccinated,TheHankHillOfficial,2025-04-24T21:11:34,1

"This prompted me to start googling if anyone had looked at studying measles to treat auto immune diseases, and I can’t find a single article related to the notion. Have you heard of any such research?",PuffPuffFayeFaye,2025-04-24T20:12:25,1
"If only there was a way to keep them from infecting other people. Sadly, there are still breakthrough cases with any vaccine. So these people are deliberately putting other people at risk and can't find it in themselves to care.",Traditional_Peak_834,2025-04-24T12:56:12,1
"No, I haven't, but using one disease to fight another disease is something that's had moderate success in the past. Before the invention of antibiotics someone figure out how to use the high fevers of malaria to treat syphilis. By then they had effective treatments for malaria, so even though the malaria treatment only had around a 25% success rate on syphilis, that was still better than the 100% death rate it otherwise had.  I think the problem with using measles is that it doesn't wipe out the immune system, it instead wipes out the immune system's memory of previous infections.",noncongruent,2025-04-24T21:27:08,1
"I get that.   Sadly, they don't care about THEIR OWN CHILDREN. They won't care about you.   Personally, I wish there were a way to just physically separate myself from antivaxxers.   If they wanna die, that's their right.   If they want their children to die, that's their right.",Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-04-25T14:36:10,1
"I’m wholly unqualified to speak on this matter but the dots I was connecting was that, if measles wipes out the infection memory, perhaps with all else would go the erroneous memory that prompts white blood cells to attack, say, myelin cells.  B cell inhibitors are prescribed for MS, for example.",PuffPuffFayeFaye,2025-04-25T05:37:52,1
