Small Packages From China Are Now Subject to US Tariffs. Here’s What to Know....  TL;DR - You are now going to be paying more for your stuff thanks to the Trump Tax,biscuitarse,2025-05-05T08:06:52,18
"It’s official: As part of President Donald Trump’s roller-coaster trade war, the [de minimis exemption](https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/) no longer applies to packages arriving to the United States from China as of Friday, May 2. The provision previously allowed Chinese ecommerce giants like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress, as well as American companies like Amazon, to send goods valued at less than $800 to US customers duty-free.  Those same goods are [now subject to tariffs](https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-are-going-to-make-your-electronics-more-expensive/) as high as 145 percent. In response to the change, Shein announced it would [begin adjusting](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-prices-tariffs-why-higher-lower/) prices starting on April 25. Temu, meanwhile, is currently [blocking](https://www.wired.com/story/temu-local-warehouses-tariffs/) US shoppers from seeing products shipped from China, effectively narrowing the number of goods for Americans to choose from. Other retailers have started displaying [tariff surcharges](https://www.wired.com/story/get-ready-to-see-tariff-surcharges-on-your-receipts/) in their online shopping carts to help consumers make sense of where added fees are coming from.  What will the end of de minimis mean for American businesses and consumers?
