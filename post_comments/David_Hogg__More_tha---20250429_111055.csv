"Hogg is not talking about primaries, he wants the party to \*actively\* primary safe, established candidates. That costs resources and creates unnecessary division within the party, when the focus should be on the opposition party and winning the House/Senate back in the midterms.  Very few districts are truly competitive, made even more so by the Democratic party pulling funding from marginally competitive districts. But, the Dems need those districts to secure a majority and a super-majority within the House (also known as being able to actually control policy). The Dems need to be spending resources locating and promoting candidates in those districts. The problem is that the candidates that can win in these districts are the same ones that Hogg would actively cheer losing.     From my perspective, Hogg isn't interested in winning elections, he wants ideological purity. That is a recipe for disaster, and could well lead to the Dems not being able to affect any real policy changes for years or decades to come. Maybe enough people will be tired of Trump and the Republicans when mid-terms come around to vote in a blue wave, but that is a terrible strategy to bet on.",ply-wly-had-no-mly,2025-04-29T12:54:27,7

And they're the reason your credit card statement is required to show how long it will take you to pay off your balance if you only make the minimum payment.   Democrats are the reason the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists.   Democrats are the reason the FDA has the power to regulate tobacco and issue mandatory recalls of unsafe food.

"Yes, my username reflects that I’m a pro gun rights leftist. There are a rapidly increasing number of us, including many who I see on Reddit and also know personally who went from extremely anti-gun to reluctant owners who view it as an absolute necessity now.   What I’ve noticed is that gun grabbers tend to be quite privileged. Typically white, educated, middle to upper class Americans. They feel they can rely on police for personal protection (or on private security who are ironically heavily armed) and don’t realize that the police are often a threat themselves to those less privileged.   I invite you to reflect on any privilege you may have that could be coloring your view of this. Not here to argue but to exchange ideas and hopefully both of us come out of this exchange better for it.    Please reflect on the words of abolitionist Frederick Douglas:  “From the first I saw no chance of bettering the condition of the freedman, until he should cease to be merely a freedman, and should become a citizen. I insisted that there was no safety for him, nor for anybody else in America, outside the American Government: that to guard, protect, and maintain his liberty, the freedman should have the ballot; that the liberties of the American people were dependent upon the Ballot-box, the Jury-box, and the Cartridge-box, that without these no class of people could live and flourish in this country; and this was now the word for the hour with me, and the word to which the people of the North willingly listened when I spoke. Hence, regarding as I did, the elective franchise as the one great power by which all civil rights are obtained, enjoyed, and maintained under our form of government, and the one without which freedom to any class is delusive if not impossible, I set myself to work with whatever force and energy I possessed to secure this power for the recently emancipated millions.”  I also invite you to read up on The Black Panther for Self Defense Party and how they used armed patrolling of their communities to reduce police violence and protect their community. I also invite you to read up on Robert Williams and his book Negroes with Guns.   Peace be with you brother/sister",pewpewn00b,2025-04-30T09:00:56,1

Dems in charge under Biden: pass some very good legislation aimed at mitigating economic damage from covid, stimulating economy and helping working class. Legislation and policies are largely effective compared to basically any other western economy which does worse than U.S. under covid. Messaging is ""We get that things aren't great but there's reason for optimism, our policies are working!""  Republican opposition: demands passage of legislation and policies that will tank the economy thoroughly and possibly destroy democracy while exacerbating the worst aspects of income inequality in the U.S. Messaging is ""The economy is terrible, we will totally fix it, and btw Haitians are eating american dogs and we'll make racism cool again.""  American voters pick the latter.  The american voters are not the hero in this story.

"Just to be clear, I don't believe that there is any right to gun ownership for personal defense that is expressed in the constitution. So there is no right to ""eliminate"" that is really described in that document.  The court's post-Heller interpretation of the 2A is just an NRA talking point that was invented in 2008, after the Federalist Society hijacked the court.   However so many people have been taken in by the NRAs 2A [fraud](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-nra-rewrote-second-amendment) that it is probably better at this point to just remove the 2A from the constitution at this point, since it is a vestigial amendment related to national defense from an era before the US had a professional military.  At that point we can talk about gun regulation that makes sense, rather than doing homage to a quasi-religious legal fiction. Personally, I advocate gun buy-backs, while leaving open registered ownership of certain models of weapons, such as revolvers (for home protection), and shotguns and bolt-action rifles (for sport).
