"Haha let's not forget King Bonesaw of Saudi Arabia got that name under Trump season 1, and Trump covered for him! Trump don't give a fuck about torture, murder, nor journalists. He's probably salivating at the idea himself.",Suedocode,2025-05-09T10:56:49,7
"He doesn't want to ""negotiate."" He's awaiting orders.",DecorativeRock,2025-05-09T10:20:40,3
"Fuck Trump but the previous administration didn't bat an eye while Israel murdered American journalists and neither party or administration did anything in response to MBS cutting up a Washington post employee, so this isn't really out of the ordinary.",MalevolentTapir,2025-05-09T10:23:44,4
"To be fair, Israel has done this numerous times and liberals still recite “two state solution” like broken records.   Sadly, conflicts where one side is weaker usually ends in negotiations and even concessions. Everyone can accept this with Iraq or Palestine. It’s a troubling double standard to demand something different for a “white” country.",Kronzypantz,2025-05-09T11:10:55,2
