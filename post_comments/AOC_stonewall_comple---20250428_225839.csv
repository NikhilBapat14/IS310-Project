Do I start with the only option the Democrats would put up would be the Heritage Foundation authored 2006 Massachusetts reform, AKA Romneycare? Do I start with Joe Leiberman's last election in Connecticut and his role with killing any other ""option""?    Look, don't get me wrong, I am personally glad that the Affordable Care Act was passed and implemented, I've benefitted from it's existence, but it also serves as the perfect illustration of what the post-Clinton Democratic Party have become, and why it's the party weak and out of touch enough to lose to MAGA, and exactly what I describe above.   We have the ACA and not a national healthcare plan, or medicare for all, or anything remotely like it; because at the moment where the Democratic Party had a President, a majority in the House, and a supposed veto-proof supermajority in the Senate, they still only offered the weakest proposal possible because ""we need to be bipartisan."" And for their trouble they predictably got called socialist and leftist extremists by Republicans and their media allies, but could you also imagine how those of us who got our knuckles bloodied at the grass-roots to give them that majority felt at the massive ""squish: that they provided with this fight, and how it was an excuse for them to do nothing more major in that two year period, until their also predictable drubbing at the next Mid-term election. ""We didn't have the votes...""   On the flip-side, despite never having the votes, the Republicans held votes over and over, dozens of times, to overturn Obamacare and to fight it in the courts tooth and nail. And any time they have had the advantage, they care absolutely nothing about bipartisanship and will use any opportunity to call the Dems the names I listed above... because it tells their voters that they will fight. The Republicans will fight to the death for the things that screw me over, and the Democrats will barely fight at all.... for the reasons I stated above.   We are standing on the cliff of an authoritarian dictatorship, if we haven't already fallen, and Democrats like Chuck Schumer are... sending strongly worded six part letters...

Politics is a push not a pull, they will demand your vote and give nothing in return unless you demand something back.

It’s about refusing to let a party take my vote for granted and hoping that by stepping outside the lines, they’ll realize they actually need to earn it. If you're always in the room no matter what they do, why should they change?  Saying “they don’t care about you” kind of proves my point. If a party doesn’t care about people unless they play along, maybe stepping out is the only leverage an individual has. You’re acting like being in the room means having influence, but sometimes being in the room just means being ignored up close.  Also, I’m not pretending I’m above anyone, I’m saying I want my vote to matter and I don’t feel like it does when I’m locked into a team that’s not listening. Switching to independent isn’t about ego; it’s about trying something different when the current setup isn’t working.  You say politics is a push, not a pull, but pushing from outside the system is still pressure. It’s one way to send a signal.

"I still don't think you get it.  You are not depriving them of anything.  Being an independent only deprives you of your voice.  There are more independents in the US than republicans or democrats.  You are trapped in a two party system and moving to independent is opting out.  No one cares about you, no one is going to ask you to come to the meeting, no one is going to beg for your approval.  You opting out as an independent will not make them care about you, it is signaling to both parties that you don't have convictions enough to root yourself in the ground and take a stand. We have had a brief conversation here, and I think you do have convictions (or I wouldn't be responding here).  I am just giving friendly advice here if you are a democrat or a republican you are on the soccer team, if you are an independent you are a fan in the stadium, all you can do is talk shit from the sidelines.  I have been on plenty of planning committees, the person no one listens to is the one that only shows up sometimes and does not want to be involved in the process.    I am not trying to be smarmy at all but the parties are both changing rapidly and the restructure of the American Politic is happening now.  Your party affiliation means nothing to me (you are just some guy on the internet, right?) but I think that belabors the point why would the democrats listen to someone about how they shape their party if they won't even commit to the party.  Why would a democrat listen to how the republicans think their party should be run, why would a democrat listen to an independent about how their party should be run?  I truly (again not trying to be a dick) don't care what independents think about democrats, as a progressive democrat I think the party has spent so long courting independents that literally don't know what they want that they have lost all meaningful agenda ideas/action.  At least I know what republicans stand for and can counter it, independents are easily distracted and unreliable.     I again don't blame you, you position makes sense to me I just think it is flawed.  I think the position you have expressed is why our politics is like WWE, it is just a show to make the crowd happy.  We need more parties to better represent you and myself (wherever we land individually) but that is not going to happen, so be in the room you can change or just be dismissed (because that is what they are going to do whether we like it or not).",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T12:30:47,0
"Alright, but here's the thing, this whole argument basically boils down to ""just pick a team, even if both teams suck, because at least then you're on the field."" That’s not exactly a strong pitch for political engagement, it’s more like an ultimatum wrapped in resignation.  The idea that independents are just “fans in the stadium” ignores a very real truth: political pressure doesn’t only come from inside the parties. Movements, protests, independent journalism, and yes, independent voters, shape narratives and force parties to shift, look at how both parties have adapted language around healthcare, climate, and labor in the past decade. That didn’t come from obedient party members playing by the rules. That came from people on the outside making noise.  Saying independents ""don't know what they want"" is a lazy dismissal. Maybe the problem isn’t the voters, it’s that both parties have become so tangled in their own performative nonsense (your WWE analogy actually kind of proves this) that they’ve alienated huge swaths of the population. And you’re blaming the disaffected instead of the dysfunction.  Also, saying you “don’t care what independents think about Democrats” while simultaneously insisting they get in line with a party they don't believe in is kind of... well, ironic. You don’t get to ignore a group and then complain when they don’t validate your structure. That’s like yelling at someone for not showing up to a party they were never invited to help plan.  If you really want change, maybe the goal shouldn’t be pressuring everyone into the broken two-party mold, but cracking it open. Because if we all keep choosing between Pepsi and Coke when we want water, we’re never getting hydrated.",RobTheThrone,2025-04-29T12:33:44,1
"I think where we are really disagreeing is that political engagement is not the responsibility of the party it is the responsibility of the individual.  No one needs to court you, you show up with your convictions.   >   That didn’t come from obedient party members playing by the rules. That came from people on the outside making noise.  That is not true at all  There is no independent political movement.  None.  A political movement has to be organized and independents are not organized because they are independent.    >   Also, saying you “don’t care what independents think about Democrats” while simultaneously insisting they get in line with a party they don't believe in is kind of... well, ironic  I don't care what you think about what i had for lunch today, because it is none of your business just like Democrats/Republicans play lip service to independents but don't care because party business is not the concern of independents, It is just fundamentally not your business.  You can complain and say ""I would join if you did X"" the next person will say ""I will only join if you don't do X"" so political parties do whatever they want instead.  >   If you really want change, maybe the goal shouldn’t be pressuring everyone into the broken two-party mold, but cracking it open. Because if we all keep choosing between Pepsi and Coke when we want water, we’re never getting hydrated.  Change is not coming from independents ever.  They can try to pat themselves on the back but it is not coming.  I am not trying to pressure people into a broken system.  I am telling you in a friendly conversation on the internet that your underlying assumption is incorrect.  I know the two party system is broken, so the choice is be in the room or be outside protesting.  The business is going to get done either way, but it will be done inside the room not on the picket line.  >   Saying independents ""don't know what they want"" is a lazy dismissal.  This is a lazy dismissal, you cannot build a coalition of independents, to affect change.  I am not saying you wake up confused everyday, I am saying that in the giant pot of independents you have so many opinions and even more apathy that there is no point in pandering to them because if they had convictions they would show up, make their own party, build a consensus, do the hard work of governing and by being an independent you are by definition not doing that work.  If you had a consensus you would have a party.  Politics is about groups of like minded people coming together to affect change, opting out of the group system is not the answer.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T12:53:56,0
" You’re making a solid case *for* the system staying broken.  Saying independents don’t deserve engagement because they haven’t “organized” into a formal party yet is a bit rich, considering how rigged the system is *against* any third party or independent movement from the start. Ballot access, debate participation, media coverage, all of it favors the two-party status quo. So pretending the lack of a polished independent machine means their voices aren’t valid just reinforces the circular trap we’re stuck in.  Also, framing politics as “get in the room or get ignored” misses the point that sometimes *being outside the room* is the only ethical position. Protest and disruption *are* forms of political participation. They’ve always been key to driving change. Civil rights, labor movements, women’s suffrage, none of those came from people politely joining the status quo.  And this whole “if independents had convictions, they’d build a party” line? That’s the same as saying “if poor people really wanted money, they’d just start a Fortune 500 company.” It completely ignores the structural barriers and pretends everything is equal footing.  The reality is, if the two major parties don’t care what independents think, then they’ve decided they don’t need to represent most of the country, because independents *are* the largest bloc of voters now. That’s not a lazy dismissal. That’s a flashing red warning sign.  So maybe instead of lecturing independents on how they're doing democracy wrong, it's worth asking why so many people are opting *out* of the parties, and what that says about the parties themselves.",RobTheThrone,2025-04-29T13:06:55,1
"I don't think we are that far off from agreeing TBH but also I literally don't care what independents think about the democratic party.  You can keep telling me I am wrong but history shows I am not. I don't love democrats but man I truly don't care what independents think.  ""Largest voting block == Most voters are apathetic==We need more than a two party system"" But I am just not going to do that for you I have a party.  IF you want it go get it don't expect anyone else to do it for you.  I will wait and maybe you and I can be in the same party.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T13:12:54,0
"Honestly, I don’t think we’re that far off either, except I *do* care what independents think, because ignoring the biggest voting bloc in the country just feels like shooting yourself in the foot and then blaming the foot.  Like yeah, you’ve got a party, great. But acting like the rest of us are just lazy or apathetic for not loving the same flawed setup doesn’t really land. It’s not that people *want* to opt out, it’s that they’ve been burned so many times they stopped seeing the point. That’s not apathy, that’s exhaustion.  Saying “go build your own” sounds good until you realize the system’s rigged like a carnival game and the people telling you to play fair are the ones who set the rules. If you’re waiting for independents to build a party out of pure spite and duct tape, cool, but maybe ask yourself why so many would rather do *anything* else than join the one that already exists.  And hey, if you’re open to being in the same party someday, maybe don’t treat potential allies like background noise.  Also, let’s not ignore the obvious, I'm in Colorado, a swing state where independent voters actually move the needle. You’re in Texas, where a Democrat’s vote gets shrugged off before it even hits the machine. So if we’re talking about who’s got more real influence here… it’s not the guy repping a blue dot in a red sea.",RobTheThrone,2025-04-29T13:17:28,1
"I moved from NY to TX when is was trending towards dems (years before covid).  Exhaustion is what causes apathy (they are synonyms).  >Saying “go build your own” sounds good until you realize the system’s rigged like a carnival game and the people telling you to play fair are the ones who set the rules. If you’re waiting for independents to build a party out of pure spite and duct tape, cool, but maybe ask yourself why so many would rather do *anything* else than join the one that already exists.   That's my point to make. For better or worse these are the rules and since there is no one to oppose them they will continue to be the rules.  Demanding people change the rules for you is never going to happen, you have to force them.  Independents could force them but don't and I think that is all that needs to be said.  I think you and I will fundamentally disagree on this forever.  My career, the roles I have played in my life, have given me an understanding that I should never rely on/consider/care about people that won't commit.  Every project that I have ever run there are always a handful of people that want to show up sometimes and avoid when things need actual input and/or approval.  I have learned to not take them seriously.  This is why there is so much money in government.  When Bezos shows up with a check book he is committing and would like his voice heard.  So i understand why it is just mentally easier for these trash representatives to kowtow to them.  Again I don't think we disagree all that much I think that our solutions differ.  I think the democrats are paid opposition and I want most of them gone but I truly don't think (and for all the reasons you mentioned) that doing it from the outside makes a difference.  You can't stand up a new party so you better work on it from within.  Independents are background noise until they put something forward, I am not saying that to be mean I am saying that the parties are going to treat them that way, I don't make the rules but there is no incentive structure to listen to the unorganized masses there is only incentive structure to listen to the organized masses.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T13:46:29,0
