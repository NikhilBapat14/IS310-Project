It’s a trap. Trump has said he wants a cleaner and safer DC. Then this CR strips lots of DC funding. Then Trump will say DC isn’t doing enough as a prelude to taking Federal control.,zoodee89,2025-03-14T17:38:44,64

Am I hearing that the Mayor of DC is offering no plan or way to focus on cutting their own budget? Maybe they can close and move out of the city Hall and move into one of the multiple empty govt buildings that have not been occupied for over 5 years. Heck the Dept of Education building is huge and could be gainfully used by the city govt. This Sounds as dysfunctional as California and their fiscal catastrophe. Then the DC Statehood? Really? Really!,RGL1,2025-03-18T19:34:05,1
"DC statehood would require a constitutional amendment, so it's a total nonstarter.  Maryland isn't going to take DC either, and Democrats don't want that. Maryland is already solidly blue, and they want to hold out hope for DC statehood which ends if its absorbed into Maryland.  Though as a practical matter, the majority of DC workers do live in Maryland or Virginia, so in a roundabout way, that's already somewhat happened.  Neither of these things has any chance of success.",bl1y,2025-03-14T18:04:49,-1

"Commenting on How does Republican’s bill slashing a billion dollars from DC’s own local funding affect DC’s future? Will this empower DC’s statehood movement, will Maryland take in DC as part of its own state?...I find it interesting from inside when people defend their support of Trump, people with families and careers  and grounded lives they truly believe what they’re standing for.  Like they’re not aware how insane it sounds coming out of their mouths",coldliketherockies,2025-03-14T19:00:25,1
"Virginia doesn't want DC *either*, so it's not just the cynical fishing for senators you push it as. Maryland doesn't want nearly 700,000 new votes changing their state politics, Virginia doesn't want nearly 700,000 new votes changing their politics, and DC doesn't want to get shuffled into either state when it's already bigger than two entire states in terms of the actual voters living there. God forbid that politics be based on what the people directly subject to it want rather than what's good for party politics.   And, as is pointed out *every* time someone brings up the 'it would require a Constitutional Amendment' argument: the constitution doesn't define a size for the Federal District. You could very easy trim the Federal District down to the National Mall and the White House without requiring any amendment.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-14T18:23:22,16
">DC statehood would require a constitutional amendment  False.  A federal enclave has been enacted, not the specific proportions of the current District of Columbia.

"Republicans don't want DC statehood. It's been talked about a lot, especiallyin the late 90's. They're scared of DC statehood because it's majority Black, and they don't want 2 more solidly Blue senators to join the Senate. The same sentiments probably hold true for Puerto Rican or US Virgin Island statehood, too.  That's what make Trump's insistence on Canada becoming a state absurd.",Mztmarie93,2025-03-14T19:15:14,1

"This notion of DC statehood has been going [since at least 1993](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/51), as far as I’m aware.   It’s only become urgent now because Republicans are ignoring the “home rule” which gives some independence to DC to govern itself, and are now trying to treat DC like a federal agency, which they can cut funds from, instead treating it for what it is, a city.   This is an issue that the democrats stuck in the back burner to worry about another day, for decades, and now republicans have kicked the hornets nest to make it an urgent problem.",MathGecko,2025-03-14T19:23:31,9
"For a very long time, Republicans have infamously despised D.C. as a city that was, until recently, majority Black, had an elected Black local government and represented everything they hated in federal government. They've always pulled shit like fucking with clean-needle programs, cannabis legalization and similar programs that D.C. attempts to enact at the local level. So much for local governance!",Potato_Pristine,2025-03-15T17:29:01,1
"No.      This is a billion out of the *current, in progress, already allocated and approved* year's budget. Not next year's. This is money that was raised by DC via local taxes and already approved to be spent *by Congress*. It saves the federal government $0 and screws over DC residents and district employees. Halfway through the year, removing ~10% of the expected remaining budget, that had already been allocated and approved, is gone. Because it's not how budgets are spent, you also can't just cut 10% across the board - some function may have been given say $10M budget for the year and that might have already been spent e.g. training firefighters; the $1M that represents 10% now has to come from somewhere else, and pretty much the only thing that you can do is cut services (have less fire crews) that depend on people who draw salaries to function.      A government isn't a business. DC isn't a federal agency. It's a city with people who live and work there. Not to mention that DC has had a balanced budget for nearly 30 years because by law, DC has to have a balanced budget.     This is a fucking dumb ass stunt meant to inflict pain just because they can. There is no sane, sensible, or fiscally responsible reason to do this except for spite. ",El_Kikko,2025-03-14T18:05:28,18

"They are not in control of the media, the military, or every police force.  The fascists are armed, so is the rest of the US. Some of them are “Salivating to kill”, as you say, but most are cowards. They don’t want the trouble of being investigated for their crimes.   Trump, earlier today, described MSNBC as “illegal” and doing “illegal@ reporting. Which, btw, is a plain and unambiguous first amendment violation.  Trump is the government, right? That means all the rights we have exist to prevent him from overreach. Most presidents leave things to the legislature to avoid the inevitable blowback of being solely responsible for hell. Trump decided he wants it all.
