"***From Rolling Stone’s Asawin Suebsaeng:***  Donald Trump owes his continued freedom — and very likely his second term as president — to the fact that he was allowed to exploit the fundamental American right and hard-won tradition of due process, which is designed to protect an individual from arbitrary, weaponized prosecution and state terror.  But as he celebrates his 100th day back in the Oval Office, Trump and his administration are working overtime to ensure that those very same due process rights are gutted or taken away from everyone who is not named Donald John Trump.

"Heh, which means you're basically saying that SCOTUS insisting on due process was a problem -- if only because you disagree on what process was actually due.  Section 5 of the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and the historical background of the Reconstruction Amendments is even clearer. I defy you to explain how the Radical Republicans, who were looking to punish the everloving shit out of the several states and hamstring their power, would have reacted to the idea that a trial originating in TalibaKKKistan would have the power to disqualify some guy from Union-a-chusetts from holding office *anywhere in the U.S.,* including *any and every state* in addition to the federal government.  Hell, that sounds like something John C. Calhoun would have supported.  The only problem with Roberts' opinion in that case is that he refuses to apply the same logic when the feds go after the states for being shitheels about discrimination and voting and whatnot.",frogandbanjo,2025-04-30T19:22:45,0
