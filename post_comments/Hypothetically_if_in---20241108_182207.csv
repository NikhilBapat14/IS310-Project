"So I’ll copy and paste the actual clause in the constitution after but basically no, the election would still be decided in the house of reps. There the vote for president would be between the state caucuses, so 50 potential votes, of which a candidate would need 26 to win.  The way the votes would be tallied is by state caucuses voting within themselves and then the winning candidate would be given that states vote. So for example all of Californias representatives in the house would vote among themselves, and whichever candidate won would receive the vote of California.  The same would go for every state.  These votes would go on until a single candidate got at least 26 states votes.  Here is the clause in the constitution article 2 clause 2 “…  The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of an the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the Senate. The president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President.”",Silenceshadow4,2024-11-08T21:33:05,6
Republicans win in a contingent election where each state delegation has 1 vote.,vsv2021,2024-11-10T18:11:15,1
"Yes it’s a tie. The winner must have one more than half of the electoral college to win, so this would indeed go to the House. ",nyyforever2018,2024-11-11T13:41:29,1
"A third party will not get in unless they get 270.  Otherwise, the house majority party will simply elect their candidate in a contingent election.  The good news is, a 3d party is not a far fetched idea anymore.  The real majority in America is sick of both bought and paid for parties. Embracing this sentiment will win it all.",wired_ronin,2024-11-11T17:01:26,1

So this presents the possibility that the house of representatives could pick the candidate with the least amount of electoral vote's to be president?,Zan_korida,2024-11-09T03:54:17,3

It's called a contingent election and it gets thrown to the House where each state delegation gets 1 vote.,Oxytokin,2024-11-09T04:43:34,1

"I think they were asking what happens in the House if no one can get a majority of the delegations. The answer is that they vote again, as many times as necessary. If they can’t break the deadlock by March 4 the VP becomes Acting President until they do.",whip_lash_2,2024-11-09T08:35:00,5
