"Just your daily reminder that Trump and MAGA and the modern GOP have nothing to do with ‚Äúeconomic anxiety‚Äù or the ‚Äúworking class‚Äù or even tax cuts for the rich, at least for the average GOP voter.

Trump is not the problem in America but a symptom of a society rotten to the core and well on its way to collapse. Empires aren‚Äôt built in a day nor do they fail in a day. The foundations America was built on were rotten from the very start and never repaired.,Magicedh,2025-05-06T06:55:10,3

"The fact that people deny privilege exists at all blows my mind. Had a dude blow a gasket when I mentioned he benefits from white male privilege and this guy kept asking me to explain myself and when I‚Äôd try he would interject, interrupt, talk over me etc. At one point I had enough of that and told him the behavior he was displaying of talking over and trying to shut me up with his attitude was a perfect example. I had to ask him if he‚Äôs ever been afraid walking down the street at night by himself. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô5 and is built like Jack Reacher. The obvious answer to that question he had never considered once was ‚Äúno‚Äù.  He eventually conceded the point when I suggested that his belief that men should run every thing because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been‚Äù is rooted in that very same privilege.

"We are.  Go ahead and downvote, but the racism was worse not that long ago (up through most of the '90s before 'everyone' had a camera / video recorder in their pockets).  Hell, even a very large portion of the Democratic Party didn't want to run Obama because even they didn't believe that a Black man was electable--and that was later in the 2000s.

I‚Äôm not a younger millennial, I‚Äôm 35. When I came out as gay (in the US) it was still *illegal* for me to be gay in my state. I‚Äôm well aware things were worse.
