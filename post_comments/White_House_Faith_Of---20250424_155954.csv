She said that they didn't really mean it like that and that was the last time we hung out other than cordial greetings.

"It’s the public face of the New Apostolic Reformation. They rolled into town with all the other Christian nationalists that staffed Trump’s two administrations.  The people blowing shofars and waving those white “An Appeal to Heaven” flags on Jan 6? That’s them.  Washington Spectator - [God and QR Codes for Trump; The Courage Tour Goes to Michigan](https://washingtonspectator.org/michigan/)  “Not all Pentecostal churches have been politicized, but the New Apostolic Reformation is functioning almost like a political party, and one with an extremist agenda.”  Southern Poverty Law Center - [Christian Supremacy and U.S. Politics: An Interview with Theologian André Gagné](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2024/05/31/christian-supremacy-and-us-politics-interview-theologian-andre-gagne)  “Unlike most Christian churches and denominations, it is easier to understand the threat the [New Apostolic Reformation] poses by looking at it not as a political Christian movement but instead as an authoritarian, anti-democratic movement within a religion. Its leaders teach that demonic forces occupy most of U.S. political and cultural institutions, from events at your local library to the Supreme Court. This includes other religious traditions and even other Christian churches – any group that disagrees with them. And they assert that their favored policies and politicians fail only because of demonic influence that derailed the divine’s chosen leaders and laws.”  Salon - [I Went to a Pro-Trump Christian Revival. It Completely Changed My Understanding of Jan. 6.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/09/donald-trump-2024-president-election-shooting-christians.html)  “They’re gathering by the thousands. They’re growing fast. They believe that Democrats are possessed by demons—and that Donald Trump must be president again at any cost.”  “They believe that under Trump’s protection, American Christians will rise up, defeat their demonic enemies, and take their rightful place of power in the country.”  Right Wing Watch - [‘We Want Nations’: Lance Wallnau Preaches Seven Mountains Dominionism](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/we-want-nations-lance-wallnau-preaches-seven-mountains-dominionism/)  ‘So, it’s not just in having more [Christians],’ [Lance Wallnau] concluded. ‘We certainly want souls in eternity.

" Bertrand Russell wrote in 1927 -  ""Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes.  Fear is the basis of the whole thing – fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand-in-hand. It is because fear is at the basis of those two things.""",[deleted],2025-04-24T20:43:36,4
