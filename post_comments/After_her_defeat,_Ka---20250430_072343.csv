"Speeches and speaking out are fine, but the Democrats lack action.  I'd love to see Harris lead here, set up a shadow government, and give us an alternate vision.  Not just complaining about Trump, but what would you do differently.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-30T08:42:44,14
"How many stupid articles are there about “Kamala has SOMETHING to say”.  We are neck deep in crap and the DNC keeps making quiet little statements like “this is not normal” or coming out with this BS.  Zero leadership or conviction, just “I told you so” garbage.  This is Hillary 2.0 to a T",Lucky-old-boy,2025-04-30T08:28:19,19

"With her donor approved message? The problem with people like Harris is they continue to show us they have no guiding principles, or at least none that align with the moment where we need to think big.",LongLiveFDR,2025-04-30T07:34:46,21
"What can she really do now? The election's over and so is her part. I have no idea why people are still expecting something from her, when there's nothing to be done.  Any cause espoused by her will be tarnished because of her association with it. She's practically political poison now, her career's all but done.  In parliamentary system, this would be the time for the party to elect a new Leader of the Opposition and form a competent opposition. And if they're well coordinated then they can even bring a no-confidence motion to bring down the government. US doesn't have that so there's no point having this conversation until the election year.",Freenore,2025-04-30T11:22:13,4

What kind of action are you expecting? Republicans control both aspects of the legislative and will thoroughly block anything that they don’t want.   You wanna know why they wanna get rid of ranked choice voting? To ensure they maintain such superiority.   Nothing will be done.,f1del1us,2025-04-30T09:43:01,3

Not seeing what more she could have done. She warned everyone and tried to help us heal nationally.  Harris went up against a highly functional social and national medias campaign designed to disenfranchise voters. They were at it for three years while she only had a few months.  Only 49% of all eligible voters showed up last November. That's how Trump really won because their strategy worked.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T08:13:02,2

"In a world where Trump was a successful president, you'd be right. In reality, Trump is doing everything Harris warned about. That is quite a platform to run on, again.  The ""I told you so"" energy is huge. No more ""well, Harris would be worse"" nonsense. Trump finds a new rock bottom every week.  The only political poison is denying this.",2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-30T11:42:31,5
"Not sure she should be considered a top Dem anymore. People like Walz and Booker have been speaking out for months, where has Harris been? The only times I see her name these days is in DNC fundraising emails and rumors about governor runs.",Ganon_Cubana,2025-04-30T09:00:36,3
"Fucking make some noise. Walk right up to the front of the White House and announce you are not leaving until trump resigned or was impeached. If a major public figure does something like that it sparks more protests, best case scenario they get arrested and punished and the media goes crazy over it. Then you go right back to the same spot and protest some more. Of course it doesn’t fix anything right away but inspiring people is how you build an opposition movement.",thehightype,2025-04-30T12:45:35,4
They can't get rid of ranked choice voting if we didn't have it in the first place.,HLDedication,2025-04-30T18:53:08,1
"Not sure what more she could have done? When? you mean in her 100 day sprint or in the time as Senator or presidential candidate?  The truth is no matter how much she did, her message of maintaining the status quo albeit with a few extra crumbs tossed to the working class, wasn’t inspiring.",LongLiveFDR,2025-04-30T08:16:14,8
"The voters that stayed home wanted to hear how she would break away from the job Biden had done, what more she could do for working families and working single people. The policies she came up with were not helpful. Example, 25k credit for first generation home buyers. That absolutely was not going to help with the housing market crisis. The people that voted for him or didn't vote for her were ok with breaking all the institutions because the political machine has forgotten about them.",_C2J_,2025-04-30T08:28:10,3
>Only 49% of all eligible voters showed up last November. That's how Trump really won because their strategy worked.  So much of campaigns is getting your people out to vote. Trump did this better than Harris.,Quesabirria,2025-04-30T14:13:29,1
Why do you think voters would respond positively to I told you so?,Hunter5024,2025-04-30T12:39:19,4

"which is unfortunately the result of her campaign manager and campaign issues. Much of the ""its okay guys, we are here for the status quo"" was a result of megadonors telling her to reign in her ""leftism"" or they were going to pull funding. On top of that, more populist messaging was simply not allowed on news media platforms, not without exorbitant extra costs.  Granted, these are the excuses her campaign manager gave, when he focused his efforts on getting conservatives to switch sides, instead of whipping up the party base. Anyone who actually knew voters, could have told you emotion over reason was the name of the game. That being said, Conservatism really is the primary issue, as a whole.  Conservatives on both sides of the aisle control the purse strings, and unfortunately few of them seriously thought Trump was going to make due on his promises that he was going to rule like a dictator. Most of those that did know, supported Trump in the name of either increasing their own personal power, or WANTED the stripping of legal rights.  Democrat leadership wants the same thing all old people want: a peaceful and slow end, because they can't handle change. Progressives scared them, because even though objectively what progressives want is for the better of the nation, it still means uncertainty that old Republicans and Democrats do not want.  But by that same token, by getting Trump elected, change of a different sort has come. A change for the worse for almost everyone. A change they can handle even less than they could proposed progressive changes.  Assuming the planet survives this, Boomers will have to be demonized for the rest of history, because the past 50 years of political and economic turmoil can pretty much be laid at their feet. The world ticks ever closer to nuclear midnight, for what amounts to petty generational pride.",ragingreaver,2025-04-30T12:05:24,2
I had hope but nothing changed for obama except a few big wins sure but the economy was essentially the same as in good for wall street and crap for the 99% of us. Then biden did the same and so would she have. I have had enough of the democratic party. It sucks. Until there is real change I have no hope.,myverynewname,2025-04-30T10:39:37,1
I and many others thought it was.  The real problem is still the voters who stayed home or voted for him.   They put us all in this mess and there's no denying or justifying it.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T08:51:16,1
Those are some of the carefully designed messages to disenfranchise voters.   How could anyone sit back when it was obvious what Trump would do? He is doing all of it.  That was how he won.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T08:33:24,4
He was out there dodging bullets and pumping his fist while Harris was campaigning with Liz Cheney on a “nothing will change!” Platform. Pretty clear why people swung that way.,luri7555,2025-05-01T19:17:38,1

"I'd be more open to the idea of her needing time if my inbox didn't have a subject of ""You deserve an explanation…"" and then the body of the email is talking about some fundraising deadline coming up and it's important we have money to fight back.  Her campaign raised insane amounts of money, heck I gave her money and even bought a shirt. The campaign ended in failure and deep in debt. If she wants to step up she needs to admit things went wrong, be candid about why she thinks it failed, and actually explain why things are different now. Trump bad is not enough anymore, it never has been.",Ganon_Cubana,2025-04-30T09:17:03,3
Is there any chance the people who are hyper involved in staying up to speed on politics aren’t representative of the working class electorate at large?,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-30T09:02:05,4
Biden put us in this mess with his gargantuan failure to go after Trump. Four years of playing pocket pool and making sure nothing actually helpful was accomplished.,Baby_Needles,2025-04-30T21:26:22,1
But it’s true. Our government doesn’t work for us. They all enrich themselves as a priority. Stop acting like people wanting that to change are the problem.,luri7555,2025-04-30T09:03:38,3
Many people perceived both candidates as a net negative to them. Hard to get ppl to vote in that type of situation other than maybe a protest vote. Frankly the dems didn’t have the trust of Americans after everyone realized they and the media had been clearly lying and gaslighting about the state of Joe Biden’s mental acuity.,Rough_Car4490,2025-04-30T09:01:09,3
"I mean Hillary has not run for office again, nor does there seem to be any desire from anyone for her to do so, or indication if she did that she would be successful. I just think this message would come across smug, and I think talking down to voters who didn't listen to you the first time is a bad way to change their mind.",Hunter5024,2025-04-30T13:49:36,3
All good points very well said  For what it's worth I delete all the political stuff because they're just asking for money,OldSchoolBubba,2025-05-01T04:18:53,2
Been watching the younger progressives. While I don't agree with everything in their platform they're all over what's going on. They're mixing it up pretty good.  The older dems need to step aside. Their leadership is way too old and entrenched in their ways. Let the youngsters roll with it.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-05-01T20:33:47,1
How can people stay home and not vote if they truly want change? The protest non vote helped elect him.  There's no getting around these real truths.  We all want change. However buying into messaging designed to defeat ourselves will never help any of us.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T09:08:22,4
I disagree. Not voting is a solid choice when both options want to rob us. Telling people to eat less stinky shit is fundamentally misunderstanding human nature. I don’t think trump is going to end up being Hitler. Not even close. But he is a terrible president. Maybe his ineptitude will lead to a new paradigm in American politics. I doubt it though.,luri7555,2025-04-30T09:55:31,-2
Then you can't complain when you get what you get because sitting on the sidelines rather than being actively engaged never works.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-05-01T04:10:35,1
That’s not true. There are many ways to affect change without voting. It’s obvious voting didn’t save us from two trump terms.,luri7555,2025-05-01T08:11:03,1
For the last time he won because his voters showed up in numbers while 49% of eligible voters did not.  You can argue whatever point you want but this is the real world truth cannot be denied.  Have a great day.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-05-01T15:00:51,1
