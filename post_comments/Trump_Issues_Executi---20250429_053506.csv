"You know when Obama used executive orders, he was called undemocratic, un-American, tyrannical by the GOP.   Obama issued 272 executive orders in 8 years.  Trump issued 220, in his first 4 years.   Trump has issued 142 more since being re-elected.    The GOP is astoundingly hypocritical, and Trump is being more tyrannical than Obama ever even approached.",thepartypantser,2025-04-29T05:50:11,12862
"***From Rolling Stone’s Charisma Madarang:***  During Donald Trump‘s final weeks of his 2024 re-election campaign, he fantasized about “one really violent day” of policing as an answer to eradicating crime in America. Speaking to supporters gathered at the Bayfront Convention Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, in late September, Trump mused, “One rough hour — and I mean real rough — the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know?”  On Monday, as he prepared to celebrate his 100th day back in the White House, President Trump signed an executive order ramping up his efforts to embolden law enforcement across the country and shield them from accountability. The president instructed his administration to “unleash high-impact local police forces; protect and defend law enforcement officers wrongly accused and abused by State or local officials; and surge resources to officers in need.”  Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-executive-order-law-enforcement-1235327251/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-executive-order-law-enforcement-1235327251/)",rollingstone,2025-04-29T05:36:31,1663

"**Posse Comitatus is under threat and this is absolutely paving the way for invoking the Insurrection Act**  **What are the main statutory exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act?**  *There are many statutory exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, but the most important one is the Insurrection Act. Under this law, in response to a state government’s request, the president may deploy the military to suppress an insurrection in that state. In addition, the Insurrection Act allows the president — with or without the state government’s consent — to use the military to enforce federal law or suppress a rebellion against federal authority in a state, or to protect a group of people’s civil rights when the state government is unable or unwilling to do so.*  **What are the constitutional exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act?**  *There are no constitutional exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act. The law allows only for express exceptions, and no part of the Constitution expressly empowers the president to use the military to execute the law. This conclusion is consistent with the law’s legislative history, which suggests that its drafters chose to include the language about constitutional exceptions as part of a face-saving compromise, not because they believed any existed.*  *This has not stopped the Department of Defense from claiming that constitutional exceptions to the law exist. The Department has long claimed that the Constitution implicitly gives military commanders “emergency authority” to unilaterally use federal troops “to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances” when doing so is “necessary” and prior authorization by the president is impossible. In the past, the department also claimed an inherent constitutional power to use the military to protect federal property and functions when local governments could not or would not do so. The validity of these claimed authorities has never been tested in court.*  **What are the weak points in the Posse Comitatus Act?**  *Events in 2020 and 2021 have highlighted two loopholes in the Posse Comitatus Act. The first involves the District of Columbia National Guard. Unlike all other state and territorial National Guards, the DC Guard is always under presidential control. Despite this, the Department of Justice has for years asserted that the DC Guard can operate in a non-federal, “militia” status, in which it is not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act. By this interpretation, presidents can use the DC Guard for law enforcement whenever they choose.*  *Another weakness in the Posse Comitatus Act arises from the law that allows the National Guard to operate in “Title 32 status.” In Title 32 status, a middle ground between purely state operations and federalization, Guard personnel are paid with federal funds and may perform missions requested by the president, but they remain under state command and control. That means they are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, even though they are serving federal interests.*  **How have these loopholes in the Posse Comitatus Act been exploited?**  *In the summer of 2020, President Trump deployed the DC National Guard into Washington to police mostly peaceful protests against law enforcement brutality and racism. Simultaneously, over the objections of DC’s mayor, the administration asked state governors to deploy their own Guard personnel into Washington in Title 32 status, and 11 governors did so. Although these out-of-state forces were nominally under their governors’ control, it was later revealed that they were reporting up through the DC Guard’s chain of command for “coordination” purposes. That meant they were ultimately taking orders from the president. In this way, the Trump administration brought a large, federally controlled military force into Washington and used it for civilian law enforcement, all while skipping over the procedures in the Insurrection Act and evading the political costs of invoking it. That is exactly what the Posse Comitatus Act is meant to prevent.*  *Moreover, the deployment of non-federalized, out-of-state Guard forces into a jurisdiction without its consent represents another threat to the Posse Comitatus Act. When operating in Title 32 status, Guard forces are exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act because they are under state command and control. A key part of that control is the governor’s right to decline a particular federal mission. That right is meaningless if the president can simply approach a different governor and ask her to deploy her state’s Guard into the unwilling governor’s state. In this scenario, the cooperating governor becomes a fig leaf for the president to use the military as a police force anywhere in the country, free from the constraints of the Posse Comitatus Act.*  https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/posse-comitatus-act-explained",Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-29T07:08:42,61

"""I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.  The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor—not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production—that is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods—may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.   This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.  I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.""  -Albert Einstein",femboyfucker999,2025-04-29T14:17:47,2
"> The signed order also encourages the prosecution of state and local officials for “unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties.” And it calls on the Justice Department to prosecute state and local officials who promote “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives that supposedly “restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens” — on the grounds that diversity-related measures constitute discrimination or civil-rights violations.  Aside from every other thing in that article that is horrifying, this would be blatantly unconstitutional for several reasons. Although I don’t know why I mention that as if this aspiring dictator with a bad spray tan cares about that.  But I will say, the implications of this seem to be speeding up the timeline of either a civil war skipping right past that outright toward the dictatorship that Trump wants. Since he doesn’t care about the courts, what happens next will depend on the military, which doesn’t give me much hope since most of them voted for him.",AllSeeingMr,2025-04-29T14:24:04,2

" I wrote the following email to my Governor and state Representatives this morning. I suggest everyone do the same, especially if you are in a blue state.       Under President  Trumps latest executive order titled, STRENGTHENING AND UNLEASHING AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PURSUE CRIMINALS AND  PROTECT INNOCENT CITIZENS” it states:  “Sec. 4.  Using National Security Assets for Law and Order.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of agencies as appropriate, shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement. (b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime.”      The Posse Comitatus Act is supposed to prevent the President from using the military as a domestic police force. This latest executive order appears to directly defy this law. This President continues to show a lack of respect and adherence to the law at every opportunity and I do not see Congress or the judiciary being effective at stopping him. This executive action will certainly be utilized in the furtherance of illegal deportations and foreign imprisonment without due process. This has already been applied against people legally in the country and possibly against citizens. This President has proven to be vengeful, going after his political foes and those that speak out against him. As the impact from Trump’s failed policies are felt throughout the community, there will certainly be greater protest and dissent. My greatest fear is that Trump is going to utilize this latest executive action to use the military against the American public in an attempt to tamp out any dissent. I fear that our constitution and the rights and freedoms enshrined therein of freedom of assembly and speech are at great risk with this latest action.       The above being said, I want to know what you and the State of Colorado are going to do to: 1. Fight this illegal action; and 2. Protect the citizens of Colorado.

" I wrote the following email to my Governor and state Representatives this morning. I suggest everyone do the same, especially if you are in a blue state.       Under President  Trumps latest executive order titled, STRENGTHENING AND UNLEASHING AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PURSUE CRIMINALS AND  PROTECT INNOCENT CITIZENS” it states:  “Sec. 4.  Using National Security Assets for Law and Order.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of agencies as appropriate, shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement. (b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime.”      The Posse Comitatus Act is supposed to prevent the President from using the military as a domestic police force. This latest executive order appears to directly defy this law. This President continues to show a lack of respect and adherence to the law at every opportunity and I do not see Congress or the judiciary being effective at stopping him. This executive action will certainly be utilized in the furtherance of illegal deportations and foreign imprisonment without due process. This has already been applied against people legally in the country and possibly against citizens. This President has proven to be vengeful, going after his political foes and those that speak out against him. As the impact from Trump’s failed policies are felt throughout the community, there will certainly be greater protest and dissent. My greatest fear is that Trump is going to utilize this latest executive action to use the military against the American public in an attempt to tamp out any dissent. I fear that our constitution and the rights and freedoms enshrined therein of freedom of assembly and speech are at great risk with this latest action.       The above being said, I want to know what you and the State of Colorado are going to do to: 1. Fight this illegal action; and 2. Protect the citizens of Colorado.

"I actually support this executive order, and here’s why:  Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day, and it’s only fair that they receive the legal and material support they need to do their job effectively. Too often, they’re treated like the enemy when they’re trying to keep order in increasingly chaotic environments.  Providing them with proper equipment, better pay, and legal defense doesn’t mean we excuse misconduct — it means we respect the difficult job they do and give them a fair chance to defend themselves if accused. We also need to recognize that constantly undermining the police erodes public safety over time.  The order doesn’t ban accountability — it balances it with support. And cracking down on sanctuary cities isn’t “authoritarian,” it’s simply enforcing existing federal law. If cities don’t like it, they can lobby for legislative change — not ignore the law altogether.  At the end of the day, a functioning society needs strong, respected law enforcement. That’s not fascism — that’s basic order.",Pretend-Bad2156,2025-04-30T08:21:32,0

"We are getting close to their ultimate goals, it’s what Peter Thiel/Palantir (an actual german Nazi) is working with Cantor Fitzgerald and their ex-chairman and now commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to achieve. Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  Edit: gift article very nicely given by u/ Advanced_Level  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.h6d7.ZwcbvFMgtpjZ&smid=url-share  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-04-29T14:18:18,2

"Obama was forced to issue executive orders because Congress (which was controlled by the GOP at the time) blocked any and all measures that he attempted to push through.  It didn't matter what the bill was.  They blocked it just because he signed off on it.  Apparently Congress can't block an executive order issued by the president at a time that it's not in session.  It got to the point where there was a rule that there had to be someone in Congress at all times just to contest it in case Obama tried to push through an EO.  This is why the GOP were all pissy about executive orders.  It became a big talking point and a political tinder box among voters.  Naturally, the GOP did it too, but because there wasn't as much media coverage about it it ""wasn't a big issue.""    Now that it's the Orange doing it, it's just par for the course.

"This kind of fear-mongering misunderstands both how government works and what Project 2025 actually is.  First, **no president can govern ""by whim""** — not under our Constitution. Executive power is checked by Congress, the courts, and the states. That includes Trump. If his policies go too far, they’ll be challenged — just like Obama’s and Biden’s were.  Second, **Project 2025 isn’t some secret authoritarian plan**. It’s a policy framework put forward by conservative think tanks for the next Republican administration — focused on rolling back bureaucratic overreach, restoring executive accountability, and returning power to elected officials instead of unelected federal agencies. Whether you agree or not, that’s not tyranny — that’s political vision.  Third, “just 4 Republicans” breaking ranks? Sure — but that applies to *any* party at *any* time. That’s called representative democracy, not a check against a dictatorship.

Their moral is white christonationalism - their voters want a white Christian state and want to remove minorities and non-believers. Their every decision is based on that.

They hide behind other issues because white supremacy is still just offensive enough that saying it directly would lose voters (particularly idiots who pay no attention to politics and rely on social media for political opinion).

Exactly. We don't have an opposition party at all. Much as Trump and the GOP are completely destroying America right now given how the Democrats behave when they have any power it was bound to happen sooner or later. Before the election I was pointing out that even if Trump lost by a massive margin the selfishness and hate machine that is the GOP as a whole is not going to given up. They were/are going to hammer down on all this terrible shit unless actually efforts and protections are put in place.   The Democrats very much haven't provided such and retreat anytime the people ask them to do their elected duty. Sure they have their feel good actions like holding up auction signs or pretending they're fighting when they do their mock filibuster or conveniently times sit in but that's clearly not making a difference l.,UnquestionabIe,2025-04-29T08:59:04,3

"Conservative minds are simply lacking in depth, originality, creativity, and consistency. Phrases like the above are all that can be used, just parroting back clever words and swapping the “good guys and bad guys”. It’s not meant to change anyone’s mind, it’s meant to infuriate. As that is the only emotion they understand, i.e. rage, it’s all they consume with curated media bubbles and all they afford others. Rage and outrage are what sustains them, what they feed on, and what they dispense. Like any strong emotion, same as dopamine, causes a pleasurable release of chemicals. After consuming right-wing media for so long and consuming that diet, it’s why right wingers bring up trans and Biden and liberals in otherwise inappropriate settings. Because they need their hit of outrage, so they will manufacture a situation to outrage themselves.   It’s why family and friends cut ties with these people. All they want to do is be angry about something, so like an addict, they will seek their fix however possible, like bringing up whatever political talking point they last heard, or some Elmo bullshit. Just to make people angry and to feed off that anger. They are shells now, simply vehicles of their addiction. They also won 2024, so the faster people understand that we’re Nazis now, the better.

"I'm reposting this response to a question posted in  R / AskUS asking why MAGA is so obsessed with ""owning the libs"" even to their own detriment:  >Despite his clear lack of personal religious conviction -his disinterest in or ignorance of the core tenets of any faith - Donald Trump successfully aligned himself with conservative Christian voters. His supporters were willing to overlook his character flaws, his evident disdain for religious principles, and his personal immorality. What mattered was that he, in their view, would defend their values and deliver on their agenda.  >For many religious voters, Trump became a symbol of power and vengeance - someone who would ""fight for them,"" not out of any spiritual conviction, but because he promised to uphold their social and political priorities. This willingness to overlook his hypocrisy, to accept him as a ""savior"" despite his blatant disregard for their faith's core values, reveals the extent to which personal grievances, power, and tribalism outweighed any moral consistency.  >The progression can be traced back to a cultural shift rooted in denial. The advent of Trumpism marked a profound moment in American history - an era in which facts, reason, and objective truth became increasingly irrelevant to large swaths of the population. This denial was not born from ignorance alone; it was a strategic decision to reject the uncomfortable realities of a changing world.  >Trump and his movement thrived on this denial. At its core, Trumpism is about rejecting the facts that contradict the deeply held beliefs of its followers. A significant aspect of this was the rejection of inconvenient truths about race, gender, climate change, and science. As America changed, these groups faced a crisis of identity - an identity deeply rooted in outdated worldviews that were increasingly being challenged by social progress, scientific understanding, and demographic shifts. In response, Trump and his movement provided a simple, yet powerful antidote: denial.  >Trump's followers were not only reacting to external changes, but to internal discomfort. They hated the idea that science contradicted their religion, that their hypocrisy was being exposed, and that their views on race and gender were increasingly considered offensive or outdated. To cope with these revelations, they did not engage with the facts or attempt to reconcile their beliefs with a modern world. Instead, they simply denied the facts -choosing comfort over truth, and aligning themselves with a figure who, rather than addressing uncomfortable realities, validated their grievances.  >Trump, as the leader of this movement, embodied and reinforced this rejection of reality. He empowered his followers to believe in an alternative version of events, a version where they were always the victims, where their discomfort was justified, and where their worldview was never in need of change. Trump didn't need to deliver coherent policy solutions or rational arguments. He only needed to assert that their fears and frustrations were valid, that the facts were lies, and that he would fight for their right to remain in denial.  >This denial is not just an individual failing - it is a systemic disease that undermines the democratic process. Trumpism capitalized on a toxic mix of denial and hatred. Many of his supporters found themselves not only rejecting uncomfortable truths but also fostering a deep resentment toward other Americans -particularly ""liberals"". This hatred became a driving force so powerful that many voters were willing to act against their own self-interest if it meant causing harm to their perceived enemies. They were driven less by the desire for personal gain and more by the satisfaction of seeing their ""enemies"" suffer.",Hillary4SupremeRuler,2025-04-29T14:46:42,26

Secondly, the amount of law an officer needs to learn is much smaller than what a lawyer needs. Officers are trained in criminal law, traffic law and constitutional law with emphasis on search and seizure. They learn the important case laws that impact the laws they will be enforcing.  Lawyers need to know all of that plus civil law, family law, contract law, etc. all of it. And they need a deep understanding of how different case laws came to be, and how to research them to be argued in court.

Have to login but it’s what I could find](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1382334/number-covid-deaths-us-by-year/)  Covid-19 came about during trump’s last year, 2020. During said year he [repeatedly downplayed](https://www.npr.org/sections/latest-updates-trump-covid-19-results/2020/10/02/919432383/how-trump-has-downplayed-the-coronavirus-pandemic) the severity of the pandemic. He insisted reduced testing would magically mean less cases of the virus would exist. This is the principle of the question “before Mount Everest was found, what was the highest mountain on earth?” The answer is still Mount Everest. Just because something is not documented does not mean it doesn’t exist.  [Trump was found disbanding the White House pandemic response team and installing his own private benefactors, including Jared Kushner, who instead oversaw pandemics in the country.](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/trumps-war-on-blue-states-is-worse-than-previously-thought.html) Kushner was convinced by his team that sending aid to blue-voting states was not necessary politically. Therefore, trump willingly let the pandemic spread in these states and got people killed. Because the people there voted dem.  By the time Biden was inaugurated in 2021, the total covid-19 deaths were at about 387,000. I bumped this number up a bit myself because a president doesn’t magically trade blame the moment the next guy comes into office. We don’t know how many deaths could accurately be attributed to trump. But considering how badly he flubbed the whole thing *on purpose,* I’d say 600,000 of the 1,200,000 total US deaths seems pretty fair to attribute to him.  TL;DR Even if we’re being really pedantic, he is still responsible for 387,000 US citizen deaths with his gross incompetence. In freedom units, that’s 129.17223 nine-eleven disasters.

"You need to look at the Australian model. In particular compulsory voting. That's a simple and basic change that doesn't require any other structural changes.   Non-compulsory voting means that candidates do everything they can in the lead up trying to get their own supporters out to vote. They ""preach to the choir"" and their views can become more radical along with that base.   Compulsory voting means that what decides elections are not the masses of extremes, as they'll vote for you anyway. Instead it's the swing voters you have to appeal to.   Crucially, *the swing voters are more moderate* so your policies have to lean if anything more to the centre rather than to your party's core beliefs. So far left has to lean centre-left, far right has to lean centre-right if they want to get voted in.   And for those who say ""but it's my right to have the freedom not to vote"" I say yes, ok, you don't have to vote. But you *do* have to show up, get your name crossed off the electoral roll, and take a ballot paper. What you do with it from there, you're free as a bird.   Draw dicks on it, fold it into a paper plane, chuck it in the ballot box unmarked, nobody gives a fuck. But hey, since you're there anyway, enough people actually vote for it to be a true ballot.   The ballots don't have any identifying information on them, but the electoral commission still tallies up the informal votes just for stats. About 5.5% don't vote properly. And less than 1.5% put in a blank ballot paper. The rest are basically idiots who try to vote but put crosses or don't use the correct format or have illegible handwriting etc.   Can you imagine the result you'd have if only 5%-6% of your population didn't vote?",The_Real_Flatmeat,2025-04-29T14:23:28,11

You shouldn't have any problems with a polymer 9mm with a mid length barrel (around 4"") with 115gr ammo in terms of pistol weight or recoil management.  If you go with a Glock, you also have options like the Radian Ramjet that will help tame the recoil more and guns with threaded barrels can install a compensator that will also help with recoil. If 9mm is too much for you, there are a bunch of pistols in .380, which is even more manageable.

Thank you for the decency of a reply.  That is not an express presidential pardon such as may be issued after a case where his EO is successfully challenged in court and a conviction is made.  Only the President can issue pardons and I am still waiting to see where this was expressed in his EO.  His EO is not a pardon because they can be only issued after a conviction in most circumstances or at the very least after the fact.

"Bad people can do good things. But we are talking about a collective. You wouldn’t say some members of a terrorist group are good people, you would just call them all killers and terrorists.   There were “good” people in the Nazi army, and  probably the same with any other evil group. But that’s missing the point and unintentionally causes you to be defending the worst among them. When talking about police people refer to the organization as a whole, just like BLM or ISIS. You can personally belive there where “good” Nazi’s for example, and I believe there where just like cops.   But then being Nazi’s mean they didn’t stand up any other time, they had to have a level of complicity to get where they are. So some would argue getting to that point “taints” them with evil to the point they can’t be good because they’ve already done such evil.   The same applies to cops, many feel they are part of systemic oppression that makes you guilty by association.

"I agree with you that hyperbole matters. People throwing around the claim that we’re already under martial law are jumping the gun, and that kind of panic distracts from what’s actually happening. It’s important to stay grounded in reality.  But downplaying the impact of this executive order because it isn’t martial law is also hyperbolic, just in the opposite direction. It treats the absence of a formal declaration like it means we’re safe, when in reality this is the closest version they’re likely to ever get away with. It’s not martial law, but it’s a deliberate move to expand power as far as possible without triggering mass panic or resistance.  The order gives the federal government tools to crack down while keeping the surface-level optics intact. It pushes the boundaries of what they can legally and politically get away with. It floods police with military gear, strips back oversight, threatens local officials, and reframes federal crackdowns as public safety measures. None of it technically qualifies as martial law, which is exactly the point. It’s designed to avoid the threshold where people start to recognize the danger for what it is.  And the argument that we shouldn’t be concerned because they don’t have the military or law enforcement resources to enforce true martial law misses the point entirely. They don’t need that level of force when they’re setting up systems that let them intimidate and control through local proxies, legal threats, and policy changes. The lack of troops on every corner doesn’t make this less dangerous. It just makes the strategy harder to detect.  Getting hung up on whether it does or doesn’t meet a strict definition is how this slips under the radar. You don’t have to suspend the Constitution or roll out military tribunals to cause real, irreversible harm. If people are only looking for red-alert moments, they’ll miss how far the damage has already gone.  This isn’t about labeling it right.
