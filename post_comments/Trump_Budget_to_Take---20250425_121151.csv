" So, for those of you who **have never been a poor in the US.** I'll let you in on an open secret. The current ""safety nets"" offered don't even help half of those in need. There really isn't a  very strong social safety net in the US.    As usual with these crazy privileged people, the cruelty is the point.",FrederickClover,2025-04-25T12:16:42,42
