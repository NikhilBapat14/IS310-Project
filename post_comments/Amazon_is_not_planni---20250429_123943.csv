Bezos caved to his cult leader,swiftfoot_hiker,2025-04-29T12:41:09,27

Thats ok I canceled my Amazon renewal a few weeks back,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-04-29T12:42:27,9
They'll add it in at the checkout like sales tax.¬†     ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-29T12:44:24,9
I swear to goodness Bezos should have been a school administrator because he has NO BALLS and his SPINE has been removed.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-29T12:43:04,10
"Amazon has already raised prices across the board in the last few weeks, from my personal observation.  Their pricing has been dynamic for a long time.  My husband and I can both browse Amazon on different computers, and see different prices for exactly the same thing at exactly the same time.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-29T12:46:56,2
And what possible reason does PoopyPants have to object if they did?  It's just like concealing a sales tax or a ticket tout surcharge.,AINonsense,2025-04-29T12:47:10,1
So presumably they‚Äôll just list them at the higher price? Because last I checked they‚Äôre still in business to make money. (That being said maybe their AWS contracts with the government are valuable enough that the loss on retail is nbd by comparison.),PommeDeTerreBerry,2025-04-29T12:51:02,1
Can't let the people see what Orange Jesus is doing to them. When prices skyrocket and shelves are bare don't worry - he will blame Biden.,zombiereign,2025-04-29T12:59:56,1
"Well, now we know how sensitive Trump is to his own tariff tax.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T13:13:51,1
"Aw yes, the company with a logo of a erectilely deficient penis flops.",Potential_Kangaroo69,2025-04-29T13:19:26,1
They should.. I want to know how much extra I‚Äôm paying to fund Trump‚Äôs Tax Cut for the wealthy. Plus I‚Äôd deduct them on my tax returns.,Koren55,2025-04-29T13:34:17,1
Well that lasted 30 seconds...,Sinreborn,2025-04-29T14:09:19,1
"Cancelled prime yesterday, it's not much, but fuck em.",Justifiable_War7279,2025-04-30T04:51:07,1
"It was fake news to begin with, Trump just ate it up because he‚Äôs an idiot. It‚Äôs not like Amazon changed their minds after Leavitt did her little pearl clutching rant, they were never gonna do it in the first place.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-29T12:48:09,7

Yep you wont get the real price till checkout,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-04-29T12:46:18,3
I hope y‚Äôall cancel and stop using it.,Folkelore_Modern,2025-04-29T14:25:05,1
please use [https://camelcamelcamel.com/](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) to track prices and let us know how it looks,ButterscotchWhich876,2025-04-29T16:11:42,1
Because it‚Äôs like hanging a ‚ÄúTrump Did This‚Äù sign on 12 million Amazon purchases daily.,jlbhappy,2025-04-29T16:27:14,1
You must not realize the price is still going to go up but they just won't give the reason why now. That's the opposite of transparency.,zach_doesnt_care,2025-04-29T12:48:31,22
"The company I work for has already been accused of price-gouging when we've passed along the tariff charge.  They're in denial about what's in the news, and it's going to get a lot worse when ocean freight that has been tarrifed starts landing around June.",Iowa_Dave,2025-04-29T13:03:13,3
"Wait... you think it's transparent to hide hidden fees? Because it ""can be frustrating""? What in the Orwellian nonsense is that.",ManiaGamine,2025-04-29T14:38:44,1
