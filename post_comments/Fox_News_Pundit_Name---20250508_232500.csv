"The law says people seeking asylum can do it through whichever port of entry they can do it by. That includes “illegally” crossing the border and making an asylum claim.

"Some other biblical passages on immigrants  ********  Exodus 22:21 You must not exploit or oppress a foreign resident, for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  Leviticus 19:34 You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.  Ezekiel 16:49-50: 49 “‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom:She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. 50 They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.   Deuteronomy 10:19 So you also must love the foreigner, since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  Zechariah 7:8-10  8 And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah: 9 ""This is what the Lord Almighty said: 'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. 10 Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other  Mark 25: 41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’ 44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’ 45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’",BringOn25A,2025-05-09T06:43:51,3

"That’s accurate. If a group like the Branch Dravidians or the Westboro Baptist Church can call themselves Protestants (which they are) then when it comes to morality, the label “Protestant” is denuded of meaning.  Those groups, in particular, are immoral by any standard. But as Protestants as a whole, a collection of groups that use the label, there is no common morality. . . because the spectrum of belief and the works of that belief are as wide and deep as any non-Protestant.  So yeah. . . Being Protestant says absolutely nothing about your morality. The term is amoral.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-09T05:56:45,5

I would argue you can't call yourself a Christian if you oppose asylum seekers. That is supposed to be legal immigration- according to treaty and federal law.   Now you might argue that some of those asylum seekers are doing so under false pretenses and that's fine. But that's what due process is for.,Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-09T01:35:52,8

"Trump's deportation program and immigration policies are literally lawless.  The United States is required to accept refugees, regardless of how they entered the country, according to both federal law and international treaty.   Trump is deporting people who were specifically given permission to remain in the United States, via the legal process.  All of those people that were in the videos stacked up on the southern border were trying to enter the United States seeking asylum. All of the stories the Republicans put out about ""migrant caravans"" were about people who were seeking asylum.   It is the official policy of the Trump Department of Justice that asylum seekers should be deported without receiving a merit hearing, which is the hearing which is intended to determine whether or not their asylum request has merit.   Federal law requires that asylum seekers must be in the United States before they can request asylum. But Republicans in both Texas and Florida have made it an illegal act to enter the country without prior permission.  They then argue that asylum should be denied because the immigrants were in the United States illegally. Except that is exactly how asylum is required to work. By federal law, you cannot apply for asylum without first entering the country.   According to scripture, Jesus Christ was literally crucified in accordance to the laws of the Romans because Pontius Pilate caved to political pressure to put an end to Jesus' disruptive presence because the Roman authorities and the Pharisees felt threatened by him.   But even the Romans gave Jesus a trial before passing judgment.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-09T08:06:19,1

"> Sometimes you got to a rebel like Jesus was  ...he wasn't.    He followed the law. He told others to not use religion as excuse to not pay taxes=not follow the law.
