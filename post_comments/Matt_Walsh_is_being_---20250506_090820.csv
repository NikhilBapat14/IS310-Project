"She absolutely said a bad thing, and I’m not going to give her any money for it, but social media outrage mobs are killing our society.",PubliusVA,2025-05-06T10:55:41,32
Nah. Donating to Austin Metcalf’s family is a much better response to Anthony’s fundraiser.,athomeamongstrangers,2025-05-06T13:03:05,15
Going to donate another $100 to Shiloh. Cancel mobs don't work anymore.,Highwiind-D4,2025-05-06T15:49:03,8
"Ever since I had my first run in with Political Correctness, I have fought back. How can someone be so weak minded that a simple word ruins their life? Especially online.  Why is it that someone online who says something you don't like makes you decide to be offended and mad? I say something, I am anonymous, you don't know me in real life, you don't know me at all but you are going to be offended over something I post.  YOU CHOOSE TO BE OFFENDED, I DID NOT OFFEND YOU.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T10:20:17,8
I dont use the n word but until they stop using it as s way to hello to everyone and saying it to everyone. DONT TELL ME ITS A BAD WORD.   I honestly couldn't care less.   The better question is why do you start recording some random stranger for saying the n word. Ive never once thought about recording someone just to try and cancel them by getting them in trouble. Maybe if she was actually assaulting the kid but not for simple words.,craig_52193,2025-05-07T09:25:28,3
"DUI and disorderly conduct? Yeah, she's the right wing George Floyd.   There are better ways to criticize cancel culture than by donating to this woman. An example would be to donate to someone who is being cancelled for doing nothing wrong.",AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-05-06T13:10:19,2
A fool and his money are soon parted. Could you post a donation receipt tho bc honestly I don’t believe you’re actually going to donate.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-08T10:20:37,2
"So you're blaming the child she was calling the n-word for being upset, not her for calling a child the n-word.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-06T11:31:33,9

"I am not blaming the child, a good parent would tell them they don't have to be upset because the person saying that doesn't matter. Teach them to be able to ignore stupidity and not be offended by it. Encouraging the child to be offended and get upset only breeds victimhood. Children need to be taught to understand that ignorant people who say racial slurs or other hurtful things are not worth getting upset over. When you get upset, you let them win.  I never said calling the child by a name is right. It doesn't matter if you call someone fat, ugly, or a racial slur, it is not right. I understood even back in grade school that people who do that are worthless individuals who don't deserve to live in your head.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T11:49:56,13

"You're not blaming the child, but still not blaming the person calling a 5 year old the n-word for causing the situation.  Mean words isn't the same as slurs and no, a parent shouldn't have to teach a 5 YEAR OLD about slurs.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-06T13:44:43,-1
And you are desperately rationalizing so you can find fault with me.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T13:48:13,3
"I'm not justifying the reaction or the donations to any social pariah.  I'm saying the one calling a kid caused the whole situation, and this isn't the only problem not using racial slurs would fix.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-06T13:54:07,-1
"I like what Morgan Freeman said.  Here is how to end racial problems.   I stop referring to you as White and you stop referring to me as black and we just treat each other like humans.  Racism is TAUGHT/LEARNED. I didn't even have a concept of racism till I hit High School in 1980.  But I am not the bad guy for pointing out that child is probably encouraged and taught to be offended from simple WORDS.  I grew up being called fat, I was. I learned early that this adage is absolutely true. Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. When you accept that, no one can hurt you with words.   Sorry you are trying to make me a bad guy because you don't seem to understand my point. You are assuming I don't find fault with the person saying the word. And that is how it is coming across to me.  Now if you can't understand that, well, not worth continuing the discussion.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T14:01:15,6
"I'm not trying to make you the bad guy and I'm sorry if you took it that way. The 'bad guy' is the one verbally attacking a child. Calling that person out is the solution.  You didn't know slurs at 5, but this kid does now, and comparing race to weight is a nonstarter as weight is a controllable changeable thing.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-06T14:07:52,8
