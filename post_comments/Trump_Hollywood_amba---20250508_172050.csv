I think Hollywood going down and having to rethink how they do things would be a good thing.  Maybe they might actually come up with new or at least better ideas than just retreading the same crap over and over.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T18:05:47,14
"Agreed. Hollywood hasn’t come out with anything new and exciting and globally astounding in decades now. Not since Star Wars and Indiana Jones, IMO.   It’s all just reboots, remakes, sequels, and prequels. Anything that is new is just rife with political preachiness and pretentious virtue signaling. Where the villain is upheld as “just a misunderstood person who is actually good” and in many ways the good guy is downplayed as “a real jerk who needs to be defeated”.   It needs to end and they need to be forced back to soul searching. Back to their roots where political statements were considered worthless and instead creativity, bold story telling, and incredible effects were the name of the game. Take major risks, do something big, stop milking old cows dry.",ITrCool,2025-05-08T19:14:11,8
