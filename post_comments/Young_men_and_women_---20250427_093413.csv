">Take Trump’s approval rating. Among all adults, 45% say they approve of Trump’s job performance and 55% disapprove. Adults between the ages of 18 and 29 grade the president worse than that: 34% approve, 66% disapprove.  >But the difference between young men and women is significant. While 45% of young men approve of Trump’s job performance, only 24% of young women do — a 21-point difference.

"Real material and existential grievances affect all young people today. But why do young men, particularly young white men, disproportionately respond with rage and radicalization toward the far right?   Everyone, women minorities, LGBTQ+, immigrants, white men, are facing economic precarity, climate anxiety, political instability.  Everyone is facing the collapse of institutions stable jobs, affordable housing, democracy itself. Yet, only some (mainly white young men) are framing their experience as “we are being oppressed,” rather than “we are all suffering together.”   the problem isn’t about the suffering itself. it’s a learned sense of entitlement being challenged.  I can understand. But their solution seemed to be pushing down all other boats again so they can feel exclusively “lifted”. For those that can still be reached, how do we reach a shared solution that retains everyone’s sense of dignity and further equality and empowerment for all? That is the main crisis of gender gap, IMHO.",trashmenowokay,2025-04-27T09:56:33,25
"I want to challenge you here, because I do agree with the person you are responding to that these statistics often get simplified to “men are garbage and need to do better.”  And like, yeah there is some truth to that. But who is parenting these men to become what they are? For all the women who get liberated through the women’s movement - are they not the ones giving birth to and parenting these “incel loser” as you people like to call them?  Obviously that’s kind of a gotcha bullshit question, but that’s the point. We can sling mud all we want or we can actually try to solve a problem.  I think these men/boys are victims of a socioeconomic system that is changing in complex ways that we weren’t prepared to deal with.  I think that encouraging and liberating women to get more educated and join the workforce actually revealed that our education system naturally gives slight advantages to women. This is, of course, good for women so it shouldn’t be a problem in a well balanced society. But that’s the issue - we don’t. We have stagnant wages, massive income inequality, and the destructive greed of neoliberal capitalism to deal with.  So my theory is that young men are growing up in a bleak system and they see themselves being left behind in education and all that our society claims it brings, then they lash out against women and against the system - by electing authoritarian strongmen.  What we should be doing is shoring up educational gaps among boys and young men, or encouraging non-academically rigorous pathways to success for those that want it so they have a sense of purpose. Think truckers, plumbers etc. But also think stay at home dad who is an absolute chad with his kids while his wife works. More options for the expression of “success.” It needs to be a conscious change in culture. Think of the conscious effort of promoting minority movie leads. Apply this to movies, media etc emphasizing this wide gamut of what a “successful man” look like.  We also need to incentivize boys to start school a year older. There’s research showing this can make a difference in education for some men. This particular issue of men falling behind in literacy and overall education is so insidious but disproportionately destructive for women and society because it’s been associated with less empathy and less tolerance for change.  I think this is how we need to be discussing this, not saying ridiculously simplistic things like “men need to get better” because again I could just say “these strong independent women need to raise better men” which is just as unproductive.",Limp-Crab8542,2025-04-27T13:08:48,4

">it’s a learned sense of entitlement being challenged.  It's this right here.   I'm a Millennial white dude in his mid 30s. Growing up you know who almost all of my heroes were? White dudes. Hyper masculine 80s action hero white dudes with very few exceptions. You couldn't throw a rock at pop culture and not hit a white male star. To quote Homer Simpson: ""'I'm a white male, age 18 to 49. Everyone listens to me-no matter how dumb my suggestions are.""  We all kinda decided that was a problem and started lifting everyone else up. Now instead of being on a pedestal far above every other demographic they are slightly more even. These toxic men are incapable, or unwilling, of understanding that it isn't a zero-sum game. The idea of lifting someone else up is seen as a personal assault by, predominantly, young white men despite nobody seriously trying to push them down. This is why every time a woman is the featured star in something, the usual suspects scream ""woke"" or whenever a person of color gets a job, it's blamed on ""DEI.""  I don't honestly know what a good solution is. We cant go back to this idea that Duke Nukem is an acceptable male role model in 2025 but we also can't keep letting young white men feel so disenfranchised that they flock to the most heinous corners of the internet just because the new video game with a black female protagonist didn't A. make them feel seen or B.

"There’s a fascinating video on YouTube done by Insider about an interview done by a former white nationalist, one of the parts he discussed is how they recruit. A big part of white nationalism is convincing white people to *have a white identity* and then *that they’re persecuted* by others.   Young guys are vulnerable to a similar sort of rhetoric as far as being men is concerned. Unlike being white, nobody is born a “man” being something that traditionally you grow into after boyhood. So the teenage category of guys is super prone to insecurity surrounding whether they qualify as men yet or not.   This is the part where we can all admit it’s not unreasonable to have some insecurity about that. Society in general can be pretty shitty towards teenagers. Your parents don’t respect you, there aren’t public places for you to exist, and your brain isn’t even completely developed while you’re a raging hormonal mess.   Add to this that we live in a time where there are a lot of lonely isolated people, kids and teenagers too. In this context that means lacking a strong social support group or community where you feel like you belong.   If you want to get these kids out while they’re still kids, or create a bulwark against developing these toxic identities then the solution is to integrate them into communities that provide social support and self development opportunities independent of whiteness or maleness. Ask yourself why you *dont* care about being white, or being a man, why these aren’t the pinnacle of who you are, and you can figure out how you can extend that to some young guy who might be grappling with that same question.

"I think a start would be raising better kids and take the screens away. At the very least parents need to start monitoring where their kids are going online and who they get their information from. I think a lot of parents in the past 10+ years have seen the internet the same way past gerations saw TV as the perfect baby sitter. Just plop a kid in front of an iPad and they'll shut up for a while. Unfortunately tv has rules and regulations that youtube doesn't so the guardrail of ""its on broadcast television it can't be THAT bad"" doesn't exist online.   I think another solution is that we need to stop being weak when talking to people such horrible views. Maybe it's the aging Punk kid in me but just letting Uncle Joe say some terrible shit at Thanksgiving and keeping quiet to avoid conflict is normalizing and in a way platforming those viewpoints. Challenge these people. Is it awkward and uncomfortable? Yes, but so is listening to another rant about how the ""scary brown people took our jobs"" over cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes. These people need to be checked and checked again.   Racists used to be afraid in this country and being a Nazi supporter was grounds for an ass beating. Now that's just a Tuesday.

"While I agree to some degree with what he’s saying, I do think the way this issue is being framed is why so many young men are being lost to radicalization.  Nobody likes losing their status. Nobody. It is a natural human response to react negatively to this. So to label young men, especially young white men as “entitled losers” isn’t really productive because they are fundamentally just victims of a socioeconomic system that has now left them behind.  As for solutions, I think we need to normalize boys starting school a year older. But it needs to be carefully done. Something like a child tax bonus to incentivize it, not force people.  Next, there needs to be significant regulation/limitation on exposing children to social media. I think this will disproportionately impact and benefit boys.  Also, we need to change the cultural zeitgeist around non-academic achievement. There are trade jobs and alternative paths to success that are incredibly rewarding. A lot of these play to the strengths of what is viewed as traditionally masculine. For people that are not academically minded, these jobs should still give them some pride and prestige. Being a plumber or trucker or whatever is hard work. There needs to be a bit of work done in media to glorify these. I’m thinking something similar to the purposeful attempts to have diversity in media - women or minorities in roles they have typically been gatekeept out of does inspire the younger generation to some degree.   These are just some ideas but the general theme is to give younger boys a boost in earlier years of education. It seems like our education system has had some natural advantages for the “female brain” that is leading to young boys/men being at a disadvantage in some ways. This disparity was probably always there but did not manifest until we made changes encouraging women into the workforce. This is a good thing for women of course, but now we need to figure out a way to boost men in this particular area.  Now, I want to conclude by saying that I’m not trying to suggest that men overall don’t dominate most sectors still. They do. But I’m saying they are falling behind on this particular issue - general education. This is something linked, on average, to things like empathy, tolerance to change, openness, etc. Reading ability among young men is in the toilet and that also has links to empathy. So this is negatively affecting society by leading to confused angry young men that can’t cope with an increasingly egalitarian society.",Limp-Crab8542,2025-04-27T12:31:09,0

"55% may have voted for Trump (for some unknown reason, not in any way his supporter) but only 45% of young men approve of him now - which is the finding reported. 45% is not the majority.  The commenter said ""majority of men are bent on taking women's rights away"". Where is this demonstrated. Even if 100% of the young men approving of Trump felt that way, it would still not be a majority.  And at no point did I make any claims about women's capabilities to worry about more than one thing. Having said that, are you claiming that men can't do that as well - that every man who voted for Trump ONLY considered women's right as the main driver for their votes? Assuming that you don't, then the statement that ""there are far more issues to be worried about"" is correct and you are agreeing with me.  Go look at polls - economic uncertainty, home prices, immigrant issues all played major roles in voter's decisions. You seem to have difficulty understanding that this means more than one issue therefore I made no sweeping statement.

"I'm gonna engage with this in the hope that you're talking in good faith and not rage baiting.   And i say this as a leftist. You're missing the forest for the trees.   First and foremost my entire point in both my comments is that rather than expecting these lost young men to have a mea culpa we need to change ourselves and our methods to adapt to what drove them away.  You can't abandon someone and then get pissed when they don't come back on their own. Im not going to give young men a pass on shitty behavior but im also not going to ignore that its on us to fix this aswell.   What I said was not meant to be an end all be all set of solutions but rather things you and I can go do right now without waiting for someone to come in and magically create a government program, school group, or a recovering incel boys only club. The way everything in the country is right now the best you can hope for is change on the person to person level as you work toward large societal changes brought about through government, schools, etc in the future but that's gonna be a long hard battle.   Now as to:  > You have constructed a caricature of the “enemy” being some nazi who hates blue haired liberals because the internet has radicalized you to do so to some degree.  I was radicalized a loooooong time before Myspace was a glimmer in Tom's eyes. I'll spare you the details but I'm assuming you missed the part where I said I was an aging Punk and where one of my oldest friends was a trans man. I was radicalized by violence being done to me and mine and I'll keep it at that.   And as for the Nazi part: I HAD LITERAL FLAG WAVING NAZIS MARCH IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD LAST YEAR. Not Proud Boys or Republicans I dont like out for a fun run. They marched in the streets I drive my kids down waving swatika flags. So spare me the narrative that ""everyone you don't agree with is a Nazi"" bullshit.   I've lost people down the far right rabbit hole. I've seen and heard first hand, without the aide of the internet and social media, what that does to people and families. I've heard their thoughts around a diner table, in overheard conversations at the store, and in the breakroom at work. A lot of it is the most dark twisted shit I've heard outside of a Clive Barker story. And yeah my wife has been called a ""just another stupid blue haired leftist"" right in front of me and it was my ultra MAGA aunt who said it. With people like that there is no reasoning with them and all you can do is tell them their shit isn't welcome here. Not all of them are that far gone but that doesn't mean we have to quietly tolerate the ones that are.  As my previously mentioned friend eloquently put it: ""What is the compromise with people who want me dead? A light beating now and then?""   If you aren't familiar with the paradox of tolerance I suggest you get familiar because you're looking at the results of it here in America right now.   And as far as virtue signaling goes the only part I can guess you're talking about is the last bit of my previous comment. That wasn't meant to be me tooting my own horn but rather an illustration that you can do ""Manly Man Things For Men"" while also not being a toxic asshole. This is why I brought up Nick Offerman give him your praise and admiration not me. The man has said quite a bit about masculinity that in my opinion makes him a damn fine role model. Im just an aging punker.   Trust me when I say this I really dont give a fuck about whether random internet people approve of me or not.

"Most women have been sexually harassed. Laws do not protect women against that. Most men are not prosecuted and rarely punished for sexually assaulting women. It's the easiest crime to get away with and often men get rewarded for do such acts.

So it isn't that those women didn't care, it's that those women don't see a future where the US will take the women’s experience of abusive men seriously.  >While 80% of people in America think that men and women are guaranteed equal rights in U.S. Constitution, the U.S. is one of 28 countries out of 194 globally that does not explicitly guarantee equality of the sexes. With the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the U.S. constitution still today does not adequately protect citizens from sex discrimination, leaving American women in limbo with a legal system that was never meant to protect them.  >Rights, norms, and laws constructed in society are made for the public sphere and were never meant to regulate the private sphere. Therefore, the state did not mean for women to have any rights in the space it delegated them. Legal scholars have identified this lack of legal framework as contributing to women’s economic and physical insecurities. By situating political and legal institutions only in the public sphere, the state created a society where crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual assault are some of the least reported offences today. Historically, physical and sexual violence against women were considered a right reserved for men. Violence was normalized and not legally considered a form of abuse.  >https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2022/07/07/is-the-us-still-too-patriarchal-to-talk-about-women-the-silent-epidemic-of-femicide-in-america/",SeductiveSunday,2025-04-27T12:59:18,5

Trump had no policies he lied over and over and promised bullshit that a toddler could tell was a lie.  Sadly his cult buys that bullshit.  The job of the dems was to focus on getting everyone they could out to vote.  Even if Harris wasn't a great choice due to the inherent sexisim in the 50-65 range it was still winnable if they just focused on the economy and some simple truths under Republicans the markets stagnate if they don't actively regress and the debt increases significantly under Dems the markets rise the debt levels off and in some cases reduces.  Under Biden the US had arguably the best recovery world wide post covid. Under Trump the economy was already suffering pre covid.
