"Looks like, in Herr Trump's case, past performance was an excellent indicator of future failures.",phosdick,2025-04-29T06:47:11,104
The 3% of Democrats who gave him an A have to be trolling.,Hotel_Oblivion,2025-04-29T06:47:22,58

"Doesn't this news story make you feel better? It shouldn't. Low approval ratings are not going to stop Trump. His executive order yesterday is a sign there's no slowing down. And Congress is being intentionally useless, they want this dictatorship too.",pontiacfirebird92,2025-04-29T08:17:10,2
"Can’t even be honest about his own weight and height [we can all see he’s much shorter and fatter than stated], why would you trust him to run a country? Wouldn’t even buy a used car off this guy.",TheLeggacy,2025-04-29T12:35:54,2

Tbf I gave him an F before he was in office so nothing has changed on my end.,Euphoric-Peace980,2025-04-29T10:13:34,1
F is for Fantastic… Trump probably,Ok_Cucumber_7954,2025-04-29T10:34:00,1
His ass is cooked. After a midterm blue wave he will be impeached and convicted. Then likely prosecuted criminally.,Solrac50,2025-04-29T10:48:48,1

Is this why he was throwing a bitch fit yesterday lmao,skunk_lemur,2025-04-29T11:11:14,1
Tomorrows headline:   Trump calls for immediate investigation into hostile and vicious criminal poll fraud  The day afters news:  Trump issues executive order declaring F the new highest grade.

You will never ever convince Me that he won. They fucking stole it. Everybody hates this person.,Few_Lab_7042,2025-04-29T18:24:58,1
Grade F doesn’t mean anything! It’s not like he is running for a third term and has to win the popular vote.,Iceeman7ll,2025-04-29T21:35:17,1

A+ This country would be a disaster if Kamala won. Borders still open  No policy at all Dems looking the other way on crime  Mega,Spiritual_Agent_6817,2025-04-29T13:53:21,-4
"The people who liked his first term economy or whatever didn’t seem to understand that it was in spite of Trump, because there were adults in the administration who kept him from following his stupidest impulses.  Then literally 90% of his first term cabinet refused to endorse him.  I can’t believe how stupid the American electorate has gotten.",PotaToss,2025-04-29T08:18:02,31
Clearly they are trolling by claiming they are Democrats when they are straight up trump-loving nazis.,Deinosoar,2025-04-29T06:49:24,55
"They could be accelerationists, he’s doing a great job at destroying the republic, let’s hope what’s next is better.",Trashman56,2025-04-29T07:03:35,14
The margin of error for Democrats is 3.3%. So it's probably -0.3% of Democrats gave him an A.,archdukemovies,2025-04-29T07:51:51,5

>so many Republicans support Trump unilaterally stripping away Constitutional rights  They have no idea what's in the constitution and treat it like the Bible where they only have this vague idea that they can shift and mold to be whatever they want it to be.,pontiacfirebird92,2025-04-29T08:14:59,7
They are convinced that the dictatorship will only apply to people they don’t like.,bailaoban,2025-04-29T08:58:19,4
They think rights are actually just privileges that can be taken away when inconvenient.,Violet-Journey,2025-04-29T16:30:58,1
They already refuse to recognize the results of the 2020 election. What makes you think that they will recognize the results of the midterms?,Dickle_Pizazz,2025-04-29T16:22:29,1
Correction.  ‘How stupid the American electorate has gotten so far.’,Upstairs-Primary-114,2025-04-29T19:11:42,3
Accelerationists and anarchists are the two dumbest political movements imo. Its literally lets fuck up the current system so bad that it magically fixes itself to my exact ideology when the dust settles. Its like wishing on a star after starting the apocalypse.,DevoidHT,2025-04-29T07:21:54,15
Not only that but they know if they go against him they could lose their seat.,Bonesawwisreadyyyy,2025-04-29T12:13:17,3
That's not what Anarchy is. Anarchists can be accelerationists but not necessarily so.,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-29T07:39:59,8
Are they just as destructive? Are their ideas just as reductive and lazy?,Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-29T08:57:21,-1
"The principle of Anarchy, that government and institutions accrete power,  and that power inevitably used to oppress individuals and so we should work towards weakening our oppressors, is pretty sound. Reductive and lazy is when you don't bother to google simple stuff like this.   The problem most principled anarchists face is how to reduce the destructive power of institutions without hurting the people who are by various degrees dependent on these institutions.  In other words: how do we start and how much anarchy is too much anarchy?",ToNoMoCo,2025-04-29T09:47:26,6
"There is no ""light"" anarchy. That's just governance with proper regulation.   Anarchy only exists in the lawless absence of governance. Hence the basic definition of the word.",hexiron,2025-04-29T12:06:38,2
"No, I’m not talking about the ideals and beliefs—I’m talking about *what practical* ideas have been put in play as far as individuals who are both anarchist and believe that somehow accelerating this clown show is good for all of us? We are talking about a subset of people who either voted for Trump or didn’t vote because of this outcome. At least, I am.   What is the actual thought pattern and desired outcome?  Because all it reminds me of is the South Park episode:  1. Steal undies  2. ??????????? 3. PROFIT!!!",Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-29T09:54:34,-1
"Practical application of these ideas varies largely per person, especially for a minority party that has no centralized leading figure to rally behind. You're being a goober.",AdministrativeEase71,2025-04-29T10:47:48,4
"I've no idea what you're talking about and what I said evidently went right over your head,  in the unlikely event that you read it.  I think we're done. Contrarianism is lame-o",ToNoMoCo,2025-04-29T09:57:40,1
"Specifically, within the context of people who didn’t vote, or voted for trump because they wanted to accelerate what they feel is inevitable—   Here’s more background: I know a couple of folks who are self-ascribed anarchists. I haven’t gotten a cohesive answer about why they think this is the “best” way to go. I’m not saying that all anarchists are like this. I’m trying to understand a viewpoint that seems absurd to me.   *What is the overall plan for someone who thinks that what has occurred or led to Orange being elected is a good thing so that something better can be built in its place?*   If that doesn’t make more sense, then maybe I need to reword further.",Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-29T10:58:46,-1
It didn’t. At all. I thought I was clear and specific. Guess not. Take care of yourself. Assuming is corny.,Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-29T10:27:29,0
"Ever heard Deltron 3030? ""Crises, precipitate change.""  That's the whole idea. If he fucks up enough we might actually get some meaningful and rapid changes in government that our currently bipartisan, grid-locked system cannot accommodate. I don't necessarily agree with the take but I understand the idea.",AdministrativeEase71,2025-04-29T11:28:57,4
"Thanks for giving me *something* to look up. I appreciate you. Judging from what information you gave me—it still feels a bit slot machine-esque, but I’ll do my due diligence before coming to any conclusions.",Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-29T12:21:19,0
