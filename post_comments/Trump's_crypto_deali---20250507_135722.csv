"Stablecoin?  Why would that be in any way beneficial?  That just means it will have all of the downsides of cryptocurrency with none of the upsides.  Honestly, tanking the stablecoin is the ONLY good thing to come out of Trump's crypto dealings.",Throwawayingaccount,2025-05-07T14:02:42,9
"***From Business Insider's Filip De Mott***:  [President Donald Trump's crypto ventures](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/trump-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-election-outlook-crypto-funding-regulation-biden-novogratz-2024-7)¬†are getting in the way of his own¬†[agenda](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-crypto-industry-donald-trump-election-reserve-regulation-sec-2024-11).  The fate of a bipartisan stablecoin bill has fallen into doubt as congressional Democrats show frustration with the president's crypto moves. The so-called GENIUS Act, once considered a¬†[quick win for the industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/stablecoins-trump-dollar-dominance-dedollarization-crypto-policy-treasury-yield-tether-2025-2), is now losing support on one side of the aisle.  Pushback has grown as Trump and his family dabble in a range of crypto endeavors. These include the issuance of his own¬†[meme coin](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-crypto-stablecoin-djt-stock-world-liberty-financial-usd1-2025-3)¬†before his inauguration,¬†[involvement in a new stablecoin](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-crypto-stablecoin-djt-stock-world-liberty-financial-usd1-2025-3), a¬†[possible family stake in Binance](https://www.businessinsider.com/binance-trump-stake-crypto-exchange-world-liberty-cz-cryptocurrency-2025-3), and a partnership between the¬†[Trump Media & Technology Group](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/djt-stock)¬†and¬†[crypto.com](http://crypto.com/).  Trump will also be present at a dinner for the top holders of his¬†[$Trump memecoin](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-meme-coin-soars-s-president-host-dinner-top-holders-2025-4). The event has even drawn the scrutiny of some Republican backers, such as¬†[crypto-supporting Sen. Cynthia Lummis](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-raise-red-flags-trumps-private-dinner-meme-coin-hol-rcna204293).  All of that is creating obstacles for the proposed stablecoin legislation. After the bill successfully passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan support, nine¬†[Senate Democrats](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/press-releases/gallego-colleagues-issue-statement-on-genius-act/)¬†warned Saturday that they would not support the legislation in its current form.
