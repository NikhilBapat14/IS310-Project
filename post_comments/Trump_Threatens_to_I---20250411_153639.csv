"This is so not what our ancestors, indigenous people, us, our children and future generations created here.  This is pure insanity based on a huge mistake of handing over power to an obvious madman.  Pull it back, America, or we erase it all for what amounts to giving control over to a bloated, evil, loser, orange, obese, wannabe relevant in history madman who is actually just a weak, broken, lazy blowhard timeshare & junk salesman with a grudge and a grift and a platform.",ViolettaQueso,2025-04-11T22:38:03,16

"It’s even scarier that Mike Johnson, speaker of the house as well as the prophet Moses is the first character allowing all of this. John Thune knows he doesn’t have to worry about the Senate because the Prophet Mike Johnson won’t ever let it get there. This is more than scary. This is allowing the president to abolish the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. He has had so many law firms kow towing to him with support and money that he now feels safe going after individuals.",Stormy31568,2025-04-11T22:40:33,12

"Even the U.S. flag that Trump was once making out with during campaign speeches has taken the back seat to the “Fight, fight US flag” and Trump flags. For example, they used a US flag as a prop to cover up a fight, fight flag.

"At least Nixon was intelligent, if shifty. Don't forget Nixon is the President who reached out to China and enabled probably trillions in trade between the two nations in the ensuing 50 years. Where would Walmart be without China?  If Trump had been President at that time, none of that would have happened -- he would have played his favorite game; ""Mine's Bigger"".
