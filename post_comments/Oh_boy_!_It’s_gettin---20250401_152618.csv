Straight out of Joepedia... The Money to Burn Episode: ""Cobra Commander works with Xamot and Tomax to orchestrate a conspiracy to ruin the American economy. Cobra has invented a ray that causes Federal Reserve Notes to vaporize, making all American money disappear as well as preventing the U.S. Mint from printing more. The United States immediately becomes an impoverished nation and Cobra Commander transmits a broadcast that it has been punishment from Heaven for America's sins. Cobra says the new currency of the United States are gold coins with cobras engraved on them, and that Americans are to go to the nearest Extensive Enterprise building to trade valuables or agree to a term of slave labor for Cobra in order to earn some of the new money.""
