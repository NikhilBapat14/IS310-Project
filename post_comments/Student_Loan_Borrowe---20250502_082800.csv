How many bankruptcies did Trump have? How many banks and contractors did he rip off by not paying his bills? And yet he kept his wealth. Student loan borrowers deserve the same options Trump had.,Flimsy-Rooster-3467,2025-05-02T08:41:53,15

Real question here. What can I do if I'm in default and want to start paying? I don't want my wages garnished and if it means paying them back on my terms then I'll do it. But they're not garnishing me if I have anything to say about it. Do I just start paying the minimum payment?,Possible_Proposal447,2025-05-02T08:52:24,8

"From Bloomberg News reporter [Claire Ballentine](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATR8P7ZTClE/claire-ballentine):  The US Department of Education is restarting collections on defaulted student loans after more than five years, formally ending an era of leniency as US [consumers navigate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/mcdonald-s-mcd-sales-miss-highlights-rising-consumer-anxiety) tariff-driven [economic uncertainty](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-live-updates).  Wage garnishment for borrowers who are not making payments will begin “later this summer,” with the government estimating nearly 25% of its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio could be in default as [overdue payments](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/student-loan-payments-borrowers-behind-on-bills-set-to-see-credit-scores-drop) pile up, the Education Department said in a [statement](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-begin-federal-student-loan-collections-other-actions-help-borrowers-get-back-repayment).  There haven’t been “involuntary collections” on defaulted loans since March 2020, when forbearance measures were put in place that paused payments. It was only in October that delinquent borrowers were once again be reported to [credit agencies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-31/student-loan-payments-due-late-bills-hit-credit-scores-with-trump-targeting-doe).

"Why couldn't the government just cover the debt with all the money they've saved from DOGE?!!  We could have gone the route of, at the very least, slashing or zeroing the interest rates of these loans and then reformed how we structure accessibility to higher education here in the United States. We could have gone the route of making post-high school education (community college or trade schools) extremely cheap or tuition-free.  But no, we chose to go with a dangerous madman, hell-bent on destroying America for his own gain and the gain of the wealthiest elites.

"> If the richest Americans, the ones who could have actually afford to pay, were forgiven for PPP loans, then student loans should be looked at in the same light.  That's a choice for Congress. I'm just saying it's not going to happen.  PPP was poorly implemented, but it kept a lot of people employed and lot of businesses open through the lockdowns and social distancing, which was the goal. It doesn't matter that rich Americans could afford to pay out of their own pockets without PPP. They're not charities. Most weren't going to pay to keep people on out of generosity.  > Freeing up money to be spent within the American economy is never a bad thing, especially in today's economy.

"1. Because the government borrows the money to pay out student loans by issuing bonds (currently at about 4.5% interest), so if the student loans aren't covering at least that level of interest, then the government is losing money. 2. Because inflation is a thing, so if I give you $10,000 today and you pay me back $10,000 in 10 years, that $10,000 I get back isn't worth as much. 3. Because not everybody pays their student loans in full. Quite a few people are paying $0 because their income is low enough that they're allowed to pay nothing on an income-based repayment plan. If some people are paying exactly what they borrowed while others never pay what they owe, then the government is losing money across all student loans. 4. Because there are costs associated with administering the student loan program. The government contracts with private loan servicers to handle loan payments, and even if they handled it all in house, they would have to pay employees to do that. If interest on the loans don't cover that expense, then the government is losing money.",Moccus,2025-05-02T08:58:26,-8

"So then make them like every other normal large purchase loan, where the unpaid interest doesn’t capitalize. Fixed rate, maybe even fixed term, principle never capitalizes, the debt never gets bigger. I know that there isn’t something that can have equity like a car or house loan, but still, an affordable interest rate and a non-increasing principle amount would go a long ways to help folks.",throwawaydixiecup,2025-05-02T10:32:36,5
I mean if you put in a stipulation to hold a job that’d help a ton. You’ll pay more in taxes than the interest especially if your job is worth anything and at the very least if it’s not it’ll give those that have the loan some breathing room.,AcidRohnin,2025-05-02T09:03:24,-1
