This is the age where everybody has super powers, and if nothing is done to control the traffic of people's super powers then *we're going to find out soon enough that most people are villains.*  It would be like doing nothing to control the traffic of cars, aka three thousand pound missiles.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-29T10:51:37,67

Yep. Getting MGT and AOC to agree on anything is an accomplishment.,shocky32,2025-04-29T10:40:37,453

It's more texts that I get. Offers for jobs; the toll scam texts are out of control lately too. I usually just respond with an x-rated SpongeBob & Mr. Krabs gif,Chapped_Assets,2025-04-29T13:47:35,43

I'm against more regulation and restriction imposed by the government on most things as it often results in over policing. I agee as long as the deepfake isn't presented as real I don't think it should be illegal.,Hectoriu,2025-04-29T21:42:38,6

"It's because parody, animation, written works, fiction, etc. are all completely legal and protected free speech.    The rub here is that deep fakes or AI are hyper-realistic.  They're still ""animated"" and works of fiction.    Not picking a side, just contributing to the discussion and acknowledging that Massie's point is right... Doesn't mean we don't stop it, but he's not wrong.",seobrien,2025-04-29T17:55:00,124
Massie gets glazed for no other reason than that he doesn't take donations from AIPAC. Consistently awful on the issues.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-29T12:48:06,9

"Apparently in the USA the obscenity laws are so draconian that you can get a [20 year prison sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_fictional_pornography_depicting_minors#United_States) for possessing pornographic drawings and anime depicting minors.  I think these are clear examples of thought-police violations, but it's established US law.",ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-29T17:32:03,9

"Massie is a good guy and all that, but he lets his principles cloud his judgement on actual good legislative wins. He wants to be the Clarence Thomas of the House when it comes to individual freedom if Thomas had no actual wins of his own on the Supreme Court.   Massie is literally just our AOC when it comes to passing any meaningful legislation. Both of them haven’t passed a single bill of their writing, but they both love their grandstanding.",MT_2A7X1_DAVIS,2025-04-29T21:39:36,50

He doesn’t have TDS at all. He’s just very conservative and very libertarian. To a radical degree where he votes against government funding and against increases in government power every time. Even if it’s something that sounds really good or is supported by President Trump.,keyToOpen,2025-04-29T14:41:04,93

"I sympathize more than I can convey, I've worked on the internet and in social media since 1998 so I know this all too well.    Challenge is, even the real person / celebrity is now very validly debated and as of yet untested, because those laws were essentially established before the internet.  Today, there are hundreds of photos and videos of me online, I'm sure of you too... what establishes that those can't be used, particularly when YOU (or I) put them on the public space of ""social"" media?",seobrien,2025-04-29T19:57:03,13

"A libertarian saying fuck massie is clearly not a libertarian. He’s the most libertarian rep by a long mile.  Without even looking at your history, I’m betting you aren’t very libertarian and use that flair just to seperate yourself from the rest of this sub and still get to participate. Seeing a lot of “libertarians” who aren’t very libertarian on this sub.   Edit: actually looked at his post history. Based on his comment history, I’m guessing Massie’s stance on not bending over backwards for a certain tiny nation in the eastern med is the reason why he doesn’t like him.",keyToOpen,2025-04-29T14:42:05,48

"I appreciate Massie's no votes against near-unanimous decisions, but I think he squanders it by offering weak-ass explanations like *""I’m voting NO because I feel this is a slippery slope, ripe for abuse, with unintended consequences.""*  In these circumstances, Massie really owes it to himself and everyone to write out a detailed, articulated analysis listing out and acknowledging the pros and cons to the bill, with an explanation for why the cons deserve more attention.  That's the voice we need in Congress.",ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-29T23:33:29,5
"Ah but it hasn't, not well.  We're sort of saying the same thing and agreeing, we're just not aligned on that precedent.  Arguably, if you've put your photos on social media (as opposed to private media, such as Google Photos), you've made them public.    Yes, you're a private citizen but consistent with the debate about using written content, training AI, etc., you've put that stuff in a more public domain so it's not entirely clear if and how it can be used.  Sure, you could sue and argue private citizen.  My point is only that the argument could still be made that you put your picture on twitter, so that's not private.   And yes, content, training AI, etc. are also misusing copyright; we can't set people's expectations based on what \*should be\* - until law is clear, people have to protect themselves by considering that it's not safe.",seobrien,2025-04-29T21:25:04,12
