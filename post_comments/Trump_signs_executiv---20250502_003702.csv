"Once again the President does not determine federal funding through executive orders. Congress determines it through budget appropriations. It does not matter what he signs with his magic crayon it it not the law. Congress may well cut that funding in the next budget, but for now law suits are likely to stop it.",econoquist,2025-05-02T01:40:29,8

"Have you been in a coma the past 100 days?  Do you think he gives a shit what is legal? Shit is getting fucked up all over the damn place that isnt “allowed” or “legal.” Congress is absofukinlutely useless or worse,  in cahoots with this felon.",genericusername11101,2025-05-02T01:56:50,2
"He does not care. But other people need stop  giving him power he does not have. When he writes gives an order that contradicts the law the press should not say he just changed the law.  The law is still the law whether he is obeying it not. And if others in the government carry out his illegal orders they are breaking the law.  The press should nor say ""trump cuts funding"" but Trump illegally orders Agency X to not to release  Congressionally mandated funding, or whatever.  If entity or the public acts like he has in fact changed the law then they are an accomplice in his power grab.",econoquist,2025-05-03T17:03:10,1
