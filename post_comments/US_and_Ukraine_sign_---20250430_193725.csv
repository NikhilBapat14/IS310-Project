"I'm suspicious.  I want more information.  I'm sure it's going to enrich Trump personally, somehow.    But I'm tentatively optimistic about this.  To protect the investment, Russia can't be allowed to conquer the country.  The US can't abandon them completely now.    That's better than bad.",Searchlights,2025-04-30T19:41:13,9

"Key points:  Ukraine and the US reached a landmark mineral resources deal, announced on April 30, 2025, in Washington.  The agreement establishes a 50/50 investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction, with both countries sharing oversight equally.  Ukraine will contribute future earnings from mineral licenses (not current resources or infrastructure); the US contribution is new aid, not previous assistance.  The fund is required to invest in Ukrainian reconstruction and infrastructure for at least 10 years.  Tariffs between the US and Ukraine on relevant goods are reduced to zero, and the US will seek additional investors for the fund.  The US gains access to Ukraine’s critical minerals (including graphite, titanium, lithium, and rare earths), but Ukraine retains full control over its subsoil and resources.  The deal’s final signing is pending ratification by Ukraine’s parliament; only the framework was signed so far.  Security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed but not finalized; President Zelensky continues to push for them as part of the agreement.  The original US proposal, which demanded $500 billion in mineral revenue, was dropped in favor of more balanced terms for Ukraine.  The agreement is seen as a step toward incentivizing continued US support for Ukraine and deterring future Russian aggression.  In parallel, US officials are pressing Ukraine to accept a ceasefire plan freezing current front lines, but Ukraine has not agreed to this peace proposal.",Ydeas,2025-04-30T19:42:19,6
"Most important thing is Ukraine can take it or leave it. Trump has his deal, an incentive to provide military aid, and Ukraine decides what projects they'd like to work with the US on.  Including none should they so choose.  Of all the potential outcomes, this isn't terrible.",nerphurp,2025-04-30T19:49:11,6
This sounds remarkably even-handed.  I would have expected Trump to extract more under desperate circumstances.,Greowulf,2025-04-30T19:54:43,7
"I agree.  This will enable Trump to say he was right all along that throwing money at Ukraine was a bad ""deal.""  It'll alienate EU and everyone who never gave up on or disrespected Ukraine.  Also it still might fall short of a Russia ceasefire which could then also justify the US walking away and letting Russia finish cleansing Ukraine for holding out.  Zelenskyy should stay in conversation with the other nations; this runs the risk of being a very bad diversion.",Ydeas,2025-05-01T06:02:53,1
