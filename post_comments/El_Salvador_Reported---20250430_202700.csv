"CECOT ...""No prisoner has ever been confirmed to have been released from the facility and authorities have stated there are no plans to release any prisoners.""  That's not a prison.  That's not even a Concentration Camp, where you face a sentence, but even some prisoners served their term and where released from Dachau.  That's an Extermination Camp where inmates are murdered in the most cruel fashion imaginable.  Cheeto Hitler's vile regime **will** fall.  His lieutenants will face justice, and although the Von Papenesque Schumerite Centerists will try to mitigate their punishment, enough people are righteously angry and ready to see a lot of these Fascists face a day in court.  They won't be sent to CECOT to die, but they will serve their terms and lose their exalted positions and privileged lifestyle.  The GOP have successfully introduced an Extermination Camp into the USA.  They'll face their Nuremberg.  "" TheMillstones of Justice turn exceedingly slow, but grind exceedingly fine.""

">The offer, accepted by the Trump administration, was reported by CNN and was part of negotiations between the two governments before hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members were sent to the Central American country.  Fascinating that CNN article doesn't seem to be listed on Reddit.   https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/28/politics/trump-el-savador-prison-negotiations/index.html",chockedup,2025-04-30T20:34:16,3

"The gist of it is that Bukele seems to be negotiating with MS-13 behind the scenes, although he denies it.  >Drop Site News reported in late March that some MS-13 leaders are allegedly involved in secret negotiations with Bukele in which they were offered incentives in exchange for reducing violence and providing political support. Bukele has long denied these negotiations, but his administration has resisted extraditing MS-13 leaders to the U.S., raising speculation about his desire to keep their testimony out of American courts.  >The outlet cited the case of Cesar Humberto Lopez-Larios, known as ""Greñas,"" to back its claim. The U.S. government recently dropped all charges against him and deported him to El Salvador, with federal prosecutors dismissing the charges citing ""sensitive and important foreign policy considerations."" Greñas, a member of MS-13's top leadership, was allegedly present during 2019 negotiations between the gang and Bukele's administration, the report added.  > U.S. prosecutors claim the talks led to MS-13 reducing public killings in exchange for financial incentives and territorial control. The alleged truce appeared to benefit Bukele politically by lowering the country's murder rate, strengthening his image as a crime-fighter.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-05-01T01:08:13,3

"I think the jury is still out what counts for extermination, but clearly it's an endless imprisonment camp to end/win the endless war on gangs (and drugs), allegedly. A final solution if you will.  Even China releases some (and in fact, I recall no small number of) people from the Uyghur camps, although if you ask some Chinese, they also say that a bunch of people there can never be released.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-05-01T00:59:17,2
