"The total for this election isn't final yet. California takes days to count and will still add somewhere in between 5-8M more votes to the total. Several other Western states have policies that lead to slow counting and will add more, too. The final count is likely to be below 2020's total, but not 13M below.  Most of the swing states matched or exceeded 2020's totals, so it seems like both sides managed to turn their votes out at high numbers there. Where the dropoff seems to be coming is in the non-swing states on the Democratic side--Democrats in non-critical states didn't seem to be as motivated to show up as the ones in swing states.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-07T15:20:32,1
"all day and well into the night we were hearing nonstop about the overwhelming turnout in Philadelphia county. Democrats were rallying around those reports as a sure sign that Harris was taking the state because the urban vote was setting up to wallop whatever gains Trump had made in the rural areas   Philadelphia county ended up with over 20,000 LESS votes than 2020. that doesn’t seem odd to you at all? and Philly is just the most obvious example. All networks were reporting what a crazy, unprecedented turnout they were seeing across the county. yet somehow there were 5 million less votes cast? doesn’t pass the smell test",WearyPut227,2025-01-02T22:20:46,1
