If the article was real, I would then look for other takes on the issue. I hate how news is so opinion-y now. I just want the facts of the matter. I know how to form my own opinion, I don't need someone telling me what to think. It was a crazy time. It was crazy how much of a problem it SUDDENLY was. LOL  As far as in person, if I am there and I witness it, I believe it. :P Or are you talking about someone telling you something in person? LOL",SatoriFound70,2025-04-22T22:50:30,4
"While China produces a ton of consumer goods, the US produces a ton of commercial/industrial/scientific goods.  Chinese labor is broadly low skill/low cost, while US labor is broadly the opposite, highly skilled and expensive.  The average consumer just wants stuff that's cheap and mostly works, but if you need high quality tooling, custom scientific equipment, very tightly toleranced parts, etc, you get it from a US manufacturer.  In addition to global feelings toward the US souring, the tariffs also increase the cost of US goods for other countries which will inevitably open doors for Chinese and European finished goods manufacturers to fill that vacuum.  We think of Chinese goods as being cheap junk because we buy a lot of cheap junk, but they have access to high cost skilled labor just like we do, they just haven't had the opportunity to build that industry like we have.  I'd you're buying high end finished goods requiring skilled labor to produce, but now the US also has +~25% material costs for all our goods so there's a massive opportunity for other nations to fill that gap",ExcitingAmount,2025-04-22T19:31:51,8
"With Trump first term he had tariff and sanctions on China. The way China got around them is if they imported raw materials to a country, say wood to Mexico, then build something in that country from the raw materials like a desk. That desk would then be considered a product made and exported from Mexico. This is literally how Mexico became the USA #1 trade partner. By trading goods made in factories that China built, and owned part of, in Mexico. It’s not just Mexico. Look up BRICS, or the port of Chancay.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Chancay",raerae1991,2025-04-22T21:19:18,2

"They're not beneficial to anyone period. The only purpose they fulfill is income for the government.   However the warehouse of negative consequences for such a policy drastically outweigh the SINGULAR thing that benefits the government.   I don't think I need to explain why they take away products, jobs, money, happiness, businesses, etc... I shouldn't have to explain why this isn't relevant either now do I?   Trump crashing the economy benefits our enemies and oligarchs. Your original reply came off as though you were a conservative or something because that's what a lot of them are saying about these tariffs.     Edit: I forgot to mention that China is signing trade deals left and right with all of our former trading partners. They are HEAVILY benefiting from American stupidity.",Rich-Leg510,2025-04-24T01:03:58,1
"Um, not really. You might be stuck in 2005 or think China equals Temu.  The US is leading in services, software, designs, research etc. (which make lots of profits) not industrial anything.  And China doesn't just produce consumer goods, they also have more high skill industrial workers ... >a lot more<. Europe also has more high skill industrial workers.  And when did the world ever turn to the US for ""high quality tooling, custom scientific equipment, very tightly toleranced parts"". Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Korea, Taiwan, nowadays China. The US isn't exactly known for ""tight tolerances"".     But most ""high end"" products rely on international trade anyways. A tightly toleranced machine from Germany will likely have tightly toleranced parts from China, chips build in Taiwan with machines from the Netherlands and designed in the US.",Wolf_von_Versweber,2025-04-22T20:18:42,15

"This is how it works with many “Made in America” companies. Take for instance Hubbardton Forge based in Castleton, VT still says “Made in America”. (It used to be 35 years ago.). Now most pieces are made, arc welded and shipped back in pieces for final assembly. Years ago a perspective BIL was one of their engineers. They had a big full body mirror in the product line at the time. The entire mirror was made in China. When it arrived back to the states the frame was assembled and glass glued in place. So Tim designed an adhesive because the glass tended to fall out in shipping. After showing this adhesive to his boss. He was fired, all his work on the adhesive was taken. The adhesive is now also made in China. And shipped back here for assembly.",SirWEM,2025-04-23T06:28:33,3
"This isn't even a joke. The EU told Trump today that there is *zero* wiggle room on their business relationship with China.

"Just because they are signing trade deals doesn’t mean they aren’t hurting.  Of course it completely benefits Russia. But China not as much. That’s the world’s third or so biggest market, and one with the most money to buy stuff, that they are now basically completely cut off from, at least directly.  Of course the US is hurting like 10x more from this than anyone else.",The360MlgNoscoper,2025-04-24T03:58:19,1

"You also have to consider that almost 90% of electronic components come from China ie transistors, chips, etc each of those has a tariff attached. Consider the move to Solar technologies. Trump just announced possible tariffs of solar panel components from SE Asia to over 3,000% for some. All this trickles down.   Take rubber grommets. Here in the US i doubt we have a manufacturing company that produces rubber grommets. China has whole business districts that make grommets…  There are very few things in this country that does not depend on parts, bits, pieces from China.

The same way Europe won’t decouple from Russia they won’t from China. Even as China arms Russia to take land in Eastern Europe…even as China backs North Korea who then sends soldiers to defend Russia.   It’s comical.

Yet it’s only a plan and not complete they have had since 2014 to handle this.   Never mind it does nothing to excuse refusing to decouple from China even as China supplies weapons and arms.

"None of this is confirmed, that includes a timeline of those findings. Russia or North Korean could have bought weapons from China, prior to the war and had them in their arsenal at the beginning.
