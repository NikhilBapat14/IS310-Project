"This is true. I remember during Dump's first run in 2015 looking at the website, if it was a major news source, I would carefully look at the web address, go to the actual news site's url, see if they matched. Then I would google it and see if there was only one source with six different sites that went back to that ONE source, which was usually some bizarre news site I had never heard of. If the article was real, I would then look for other takes on the issue. I hate how news is so opinion-y now. I just want the facts of the matter. I know how to form my own opinion, I don't need someone telling me what to think. It was a crazy time. It was crazy how much of a problem it SUDDENLY was.

"While China produces a ton of consumer goods, the US produces a ton of commercial/industrial/scientific goods.  Chinese labor is broadly low skill/low cost, while US labor is broadly the opposite, highly skilled and expensive.  The average consumer just wants stuff that's cheap and mostly works, but if you need high quality tooling, custom scientific equipment, very tightly toleranced parts, etc, you get it from a US manufacturer.  In addition to global feelings toward the US souring, the tariffs also increase the cost of US goods for other countries which will inevitably open doors for Chinese and European finished goods manufacturers to fill that vacuum.  We think of Chinese goods as being cheap junk because we buy a lot of cheap junk, but they have access to high cost skilled labor just like we do, they just haven't had the opportunity to build that industry like we have.  I'd you're buying high end finished goods requiring skilled labor to produce, but now the US also has +~25% material costs for all our goods so there's a massive opportunity for other nations to fill that gap",ExcitingAmount,2025-04-22T19:31:51,8
"With Trump first term he had tariff and sanctions on China. The way China got around them is if they imported raw materials to a country, say wood to Mexico, then build something in that country from the raw materials like a desk. That desk would then be considered a product made and exported from Mexico. This is literally how Mexico became the USA #1 trade partner. By trading goods made in factories that China built, and owned part of, in Mexico. It‚Äôs not just Mexico.

However the warehouse of negative consequences for such a policy drastically outweigh the SINGULAR thing that benefits the government.   I don't think I need to explain why they take away products, jobs, money, happiness, businesses, etc... I shouldn't have to explain why this isn't relevant either now do I?   Trump crashing the economy benefits our enemies and oligarchs. Your original reply came off as though you were a conservative or something because that's what a lot of them are saying about these tariffs.

"Um, not really. You might be stuck in 2005 or think China equals Temu.  The US is leading in services, software, designs, research etc. (which make lots of profits) not industrial anything.  And China doesn't just produce consumer goods, they also have more high skill industrial workers ... >a lot more<. Europe also has more high skill industrial workers.  And when did the world ever turn to the US for ""high quality tooling, custom scientific equipment, very tightly toleranced parts"". Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Korea, Taiwan, nowadays China. The US isn't exactly known for ""tight tolerances"".     But most ""high end"" products rely on international trade anyways.

They had a big full body mirror in the product line at the time. The entire mirror was made in China. When it arrived back to the states the frame was assembled and glass glued in place.
