Imagine a LLM writing a flyer aimed at your personal situation specifically and it arriving in your mailbox perfectly glossy.

Register to vote with this form and you will be entered into the Musk lottery - you could win $1 million!"" Meanwhile your social media is bombarding you with how much candidate AOC favors the Somalian ethnic group: and Somalians are your particular bugbear: you just can't STAND them since that Somalian family next door kept you up all night for a year with their noisy parties and irritable baby.

"Yep. I've been saying this for a while.  Imagine all the resources of the federal government that affect an individual being based on your attitudes and expressions about the Trump administration. Social Security payments, Medicare/Medicaid coverage, taxation, air travel, border crossing... even the criminal justice system... all tilted to favor people who consistently demonstrate loyalty to the federal government, and to punish people who don't.  Imagine your local cops having access to a national ""political dissidents"" database and pulling people over to harass them based on what they wrote about Trump on Reddit or Facebook a year ago.

"“Today, they argued, Trump is targeting law firms, but DOGE data could allow him to target individual Americans at scale. For instance, they described how the government, aside from providing benefits, is also a debt collector on all kinds of federal loans. Those who struggle to repay, they said, could be punished beyond what’s possible now, by having professional licenses revoked or having their wages or bank accounts frozen.  These data could also allow the government or, should they be shared, its private-sector allies to target big swaths of the population based on a supposed attribute or trait. Maybe you have information from background checks or health studies that allows you to punish people who have seen a therapist for mental illness. Or to terminate certain public benefits to anybody who has ever shown income above a particular threshold, claiming that they obviously don’t need public benefits because they once made a high salary.”  And don’t forget they also have your social media activity, who you donated to, what protests you participated it, etc.",AliveTank5987,2025-04-27T11:10:50,9

He initially praised the covid vaccines and encouraged his followers to get vaccinated, but swiftly reversed course after MAGA pushed back.

Trans people are the Christian right's current scapegoat, for what they see as the cultural and moral decline of society.

Genocide is the intentional and systematic destruction of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious groups.
