"**From Dr. Jessica Calarco, sociologist and author:**  Eliminating Head Start and Early Head Start risks pushing more families into this kind of precarity. And, arguably, that kind of precarity is the point. Because precarity limits people’s choices, and limited choices make people easier to exploit. Sadly, it seems this White House may be just fine with that.

"But let’s face facts here, it’s just that, a narrative. They don’t care about nor do they even want to know about waste, fraud, OR abuse. It’s about raising money to line their pockets, fund their schemes, and create a culture of hate and division.",RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-24T14:49:48,2
"Him shutting down independent, profitable agencies undermines him. We all know this has nothing to do with waste fraud and abuse since they have done more of that in the past two months than has been discovered in a long time.",SatoriFound70,2025-04-24T15:06:26,1
"I am confused by the author's opinion. Her narrating precarity in the life of Tara is fine, but Tara didn't take part on Early Head Start. Unless she did, and the author left it out by accident. Tara made too much money when she and her husband were working. When she quit her job, did they qualify and benefit from the services to enable her to return to school, get training somewhere, acquire parenting skills for increased mental health? It sounds like Tara has a pitiful situation that Early Head Start/Head Start could help, but she isn't getting the services.   Also, some Head Starts have bus services, but I'm assuming Tara's Indiana one doesn't have it. The problem of transportation would help contextualize the 15 minute out-of-the-way location. In its ideal form, Head Start could lift someone like Tara out of her precarity, but the author says nothing about her being in the program. Just confusing.",archaeoND,2025-04-24T15:58:09,1
