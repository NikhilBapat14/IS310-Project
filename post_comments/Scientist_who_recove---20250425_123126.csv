"It's incredibly depressing to see how close we are to losing such an important piece of our natural heritage, especially considering that Chris Servheen's work showed without the Endangered Species Act, there wouldn't even *be* grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem today, it's just shocking and awful, honestly, and given that these animals generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tourist income, benefiting local communities, it's clear we have a responsibility to protect them, though some folks just don't seem to care.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-25T12:47:45,10

"Other species, meaning anyone or anything beside himself, is not on the radar of Trump.  But this administration’s destructive impulse absolutely matters.  Their cavalier treatment of the environment is not going unnoticed, despite many other outrages.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T12:36:56,6
Trump's policies do not risk irreparable harm: They cynically aim directly for irreparable harm.     Whatever the worst imaginable human being would do is exactly what MAGA is doing on any given issue at any given moment.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-25T12:53:47,5
"Too late.  Well, unless some of those animals with such conservation status start their own retribution against the humans who put them in this predicament.",thieh,2025-04-25T12:38:15,2
"You’re at a point where there are clear obstacles on the road to not just a good future, but any fucking future at all.   If Americans don’t fight and win against the obstacles in their path we’re all fucked. You can’t expect any help, either - your military is too powerful, your nukes too numerous and your code-holders too insane for that to happen.   It’s all on you. You already fucked up massively and let literal fascists take over. Either you clear house or we’re all fucked.",Drolb,2025-04-25T12:55:50,5
