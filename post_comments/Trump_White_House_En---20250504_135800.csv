"***From Rolling Stone’s Peter Wade:***  The Trump White House shared a graphic image of Trump, veiny biceps and other inhuman muscles bulging, holding a red light saber in celebration of May the Fourth — an informal Star Wars holiday and pun on “May the Force be with you.” Meanwhile, the administration’s chief Border Patrol agent posted a video depicting the agency as Darth Vader killing rebel soldiers. The administration, apparently, doesn’t mind that these depictions align them with the antagonists of the film franchise.

"I think we need to ask smarter questions about and demand better answers for immigration. The way I see it, there are three different buckets for anti-immigration sentiment:  1. Economic 2. Health and Safety 3. Xenophobia  I don’t fault the hearts of those who fall into the first two categories, but those two need to be better understood.   Economically:  1. Immigrant labor keeps many costs in check. Removing immigrants is highly inflationary (construction, groceries, etc) 2. Immigrants are three times more likely to create jobs than native born citizens.  3. Immigrants are more likely to contribute to SS while not drawing from it.  4. We need a replacement rate of 2.1% in the workforce to ensure income tax payers are broad enough to cover the costs of retirees. Our birth rate is only 1.6%. Immigration can bridge the gap.  5.  Counter argument- besides SS, there may be other taxpayer services and benefits that go towards immigrants where resources are limited and therefore citizens are less likely to enjoy. Not sure what they are but I want to be fair about this.   Health and Safety 1. Immigrants are less likely to commit non-immigration related crime than nonimmigrants.  2. Icing immigrants mean they are less likely to come to police to report crimes.   This leads xenophobia. And when a presidential candidate starts talking about immigrants as vermin or poison to the blood of the nation, I think there is zero doubt xenophobia, rather than economic or security interests, are driving this. This is a very ugly look for our country. ",porkbellies37,2025-05-04T14:28:43,6

I sincerely believe that when you have so much money that you have no issues in life to worry about anymore, I think that good and evil aren't even relevant concepts to you anymore.

There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.   And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that.   And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege. Remember this. Try.""",Darmok47,2025-05-04T16:42:23,187
