"And revoke immunity for Trump specifically. Rule that Trump has no presidential immunity. Either Trump arrested immediately for the many many crimes he's pulled, or he has to toe the line to avoid being arrested from then on, which he won't do. Regardless, revoking the immunity would neuter Trump immediately and with no real effort on SCOTUS' part, and they've had grounds to do so for a while.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-02T21:59:33,71

"The problem with throwing out immunity entirely is they'd just go back to presumed immunity which wouldn't help much because it's legally a mess. By ruling the Trump and only Trump loses all immunity that would make it explicit when a president does and does not have immunity. By doing so, SCOTUS would set up a precedent that yeah, presidents have immunity generally speaking, but they can lose that immunity, ALL forms of immunity if and when they abuse it.  This is something SCOTUS should be all for considering that gives them power, gives them a means to enforce their own rulings, stops bastards like Trump from exploiting immunity, give this country a way to get rid of corrupt presidents like Trump in the future without needing impeachment, and forces presidents in the future to watch their step or they lose immunity, especially if they openly defy SCOTUS, but at the same time doesn't give SCOTUS the ability to just outright call for an innocent president to be arrested. Even if SCOTUS decided to remove the immunity of an innocent president ""just because"" it wouldn't give SCOTUS the ability to arrest that president until said president actually does something illegal.  Such removal of immunity would also prevent a president from pardoning themselves, as that would be covered under the immunity. It effectively solves every issue all at once except Trump refusing to allow himself to be arrested, which is a whole other issue.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-03T00:15:49,4
No president prior to him needed explicit immunity from the laws they are meant to execute. His whining that he needed it or else the presidency would face insurmountable vulnerabilities was just nuts to start out with.,lucasjkr,2025-05-04T00:02:40,1
