">The halt will only be for cars destined for Canada.   As far as I can [tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mazda_facilities#List_of_Mazda_production_plants), Mazda doesn't have any assembly lines in Canada, so I guess they'll import there from another country.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-04-27T12:53:54,6
"Pause is for Canadian market vehicles (CX-50).  Production for other markets will continue.    So more accurately, a market is being paused not a vehicle production.",BraxTaplock,2025-04-27T12:55:54,6

Saw something about Subaru considering shutting down it's plant in Indiana as it less of headache to import vehicles once over dealing with potential multiple tariffs on all the various individual parts. They may go back to building the cars in Japan and shipping them here.  I suspect it won't be long until Toyota does the same.,crucialcolin,2025-04-28T05:18:14,1
