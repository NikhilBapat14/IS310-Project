A lot of Democrats are not clinging to Biden.  The most important bit is that Biden has over 90% of the pledged delegates set for the Convention in the primary we just had.  So Democrats that feel he should step aside need to convince him to step aside so that he will release his delegates to someone else.  That someone else would almost certainly be Vice President Harris for a number of reasons but most relevantly as she's the only other potential replacement who has legal access to the millions of dollars raised by the Biden campaign for the election.,federalist66,2024-07-12T09:25:21,125
"I believe it’s a multi layered answer.  1) Biden still has a right to run. If he doesn’t step aside of his own free will, they cannot force him. He was winning his primaries, albeit against nobodies, handily. Nobody serious stepped up to run against him. So why would he step down? Forcing him out somehow could be a very bad look for the DNC and majorly backfire on them.   2) A year + ago it probably wouldn’t have been so bad. The main issue currently is the timing. We are 4 months away from Election Day. That’s not a lot of time to mount a nationwide campaign for president. Yes, a large contingent will vote strictly against Trump. But there are a ton of moderate/centrist/independent voters who do sit on the fence and 4 months may not be enough time to win them over.   3) Most polls, that I have seen, show that no other potential candidates poll better than Biden does anyway. Though Whitmer and Buttigieg do seem to perform better in key swing states to make those races more interesting.",dickpierce69,2024-07-12T09:26:22,66
"If Biden dropped out now the party would have ~30 days to:  1) Convince Harris to step down from the ticket (and accept the insult)  2) Find a new candidate with enough recognition to win, but no baggage   3) Develop an entire new campaign strategy   4) Move millions of dollars in campaign contributions between multiple parties  5) Figure out how to convince everyone that they should be excited that a person they may or may not know is now the candidate  6) Convince everyone it's totally fine that the DMC just threw everyone's votes away and choose a candidate without consulting the voters at all  7) Figure out strategies and arguments to counter the GOP's new attacks against someone they have had no time to prepare   8) Pray the new person doesn't slip up once  And finally   9) Still somehow win what will likely be one of the most contentious elections in America history against a person whose supporters will almost kill themselves just to see, and 30% of the population who view him as the lesser evil because he supports tax cuts for people richer than them.   Oh and they would also somehow have to maintain a positive working relationship with a man they just stole the presidency from on the belief he is too old and senile to do the job he currently has, for 6 months.",ResidentBackground35,2024-07-12T13:14:31,18
I don't agree with all of these but here are the common arguments against      1. Its anti democratic: Biden did win all of the democratic primaries (atleast partly because no other significant democrats ran against him)   2. It is uncertain: This would be an unprecedented change no party has changed its candidate this late in the election cycle and there isn't a clear process for it.   3. Who is the replacement: Switching now there isn't a slam dunk replacement Harris would be the most likely but people didn't vote for her as the candidate. A lot of infighting could occur between the different segments of the democratic party  4. Money: The Biden campaign already has a massive war chest of funds that only it can access and due to campaign finance laws it could not transfer the vast majority of it to a new campaign. (possibly could to Harris as she is part of the current campaign)   5. Personal: At this point there is no mechanism to replace Biden unless he chooses to be replaced.,aBrightIdea,2024-07-12T09:27:45,22
"Biden cannot be forced not to run. He's secured the delegates to win the nomination and they are required to vote for him on the first ballot at the convention unless he releases them. The DNC changing the rules at this point to allow them to no longer be pledged to Biden would invite lawsuits immediately.   If Biden were convinced to not run the question becomes who is the nominee? There would be a substantial party fight at the convention to decide the nominee.   No potential nominee polls substantially better than Biden. And as soon as a nominee was chosen the Republican party would initiate an all out attack on that individual as well as on the Democratic party as a whole for being disorganized, corrupt, etc...  The nominee would have about 3 months to gain enough name recognition and trust to win the election. Candidates usually take years to establish that type of recognition. Trying to do it in 3 months is virtually impossible.   In the end it would be a messy fight with a fractured party and 3 months to win an election.",mojo4394,2024-07-12T09:35:22,14
You can’t just assume switching him out would be less risky or lead to a better outcome. I have zero faith that the DNC could put up a different candidate without it turning into a shitshow (like booting Harris and replacing her with a white person or something equally stupid),MagicWishMonkey,2024-07-12T13:51:18,6

"Others have had a different take, and they are not completely wrong.    My take:   Biden has a bit of a stutter and he will often make impulsive comments to the press that hurt him later.  This has always been true.  Trump is a bad candidate for a lot of reasons.    The people surrounding/supporting Biden have tried to limit Biden's exposure to unscripted press to let Donald keep saying things that damage his campaign.    Their thoughts: ""We will win if we can keep the focus on Trump""  Since the debate, for the first time in 10 years, the media isn't focusing on Trump.  Talking about replacing Biden is keeping the focus off Trump.  Actually replacing Biden will keep the focus off Trump even longer.  This goes against the entire campaign strategy of the Biden supporters so they see it as a losing strategy.    This is why, not only do they not want to replace Biden, they want everyone and the press to stop talking about it.  Edit: I and many others think, not only it wouldn't be a big deal, it would be a great thing for the Democratic party by proving that the Democrats care more about running a good candidate than being a cult supporting one man like a fascist government",RamBamBooey,2024-07-12T15:31:07,4

"I don't necessarily agree with all of these, but these are the arguments:  * Biden won the primary contests, which is the way we choose our nominees. That means it'd be very hard to oust him without his cooperation, and he doesn't want to drop. (There are probably ways it could be engineered, but all of them would be controversial among voters, and you'd probably lose more than you'd pick up.)  * The main reason we use primaries to determine who the nominees are is because it provides a testing ground to see how their popularity will hold up through a campaign, see what attacks they'll face, see how voters respond to attacks, etc. If you replace him with somebody who hasn't been through that process, it's entirely possible that they might be popular with voters *now*, but that once they replace Biden, they would lose popularity in response to effective attack ads or scandals that pop up. Biden's weaknesses are at least baked in/predictable--he's not going to lose a whole lot more voters than he already has.  * Everybody else who realistically could replace him polls similarly or worse to him.  * The only person who could *truly* realistically replace him is Vice President Harris, because our campaign finance laws make it complicated to transfer the campaign funds to anyone else. She has her own complications with electability already. (For example, the US has never elected a woman president.)  * This is getting into the nitty gritty of things, but to try to explain it to a non-American ... because of the way America selects its president, there are certain states that matter more than others. The three that are must-win for the Democrats are three Midwestern states where a moderate white male candidate would likely do better than a black woman that's perceived to be very liberal. In 2016, these states swung hard for Trump/against Clinton.  * Biden's not really in an unrecoverable position--he's down about 2-3% in the polls. That's not really a position where you normally consider replacing your candidate. If he was down 10% or something, that idea would make more sense.  * Changing a candidate late in the game like this conveys weakness/panic, and voters don't like that.  * The only two times a party has changed their ticket like that, they lost in landslides anyway. (The Democrats changed their president in 1968 and their VP in 1972.)  * Switching over candidates doesn't mean campaign offices, funds, workers, advertising, etc. automatically transfer. In some ways you'd have to be creating a campaign from scratch a few months out from the election. (You usually have a solid 1.5-2 years to build a campaign.)",anneoftheisland,2024-07-12T17:37:51,3
"I think the loudest voices against Biden aren't coming from the Democrats. The first time he should have run, the DNC put all of their support behind Hillary. We see how well **THAT** turned out.   The worst-case scenario is he runs, gets reelected, takes the oath, and resigns shortly after. Then Harris will assume the office. While she would have the financial backing, the fact that she'd have trouble is because she is a female person of color. She has spent the last year drumming support for Biden,  who fits ""the look"" of a president: an old white guy.   If Biden resigns after taking office, Harris will have 4 years to drum up support for herself. And she'll need it. Look at how Obama got the support of minorities when he ran in '08. He needed it in 2012, running against Romney, who was suddenly embraced by the Evangelical Christians. IIRC,  Billy Graham removed the pages from his website, which denounced the Mormon church. She'll face the same bigotry that Obama did.",Swiggy1957,2024-07-12T17:30:20,3
"A few reasons:  —As much as it sounds like anyone would do better against Trump compared to Biden, Trump actually does better against everyone else. The only person who gives him trouble in the polls is Biden. Trump beats people like Harris, Whitmer, Newsom, Pete, etc. in polls. Biden and Trump are about even. Trump beats basically everyone else in the polls. The only logical candidate besides Biden, Harris, actually does worse in the polls.   —Think about how embarrassing it would be if Dems said “yup, we’re switching out Biden.” That’s after supporting him for a year and a half. That’s basically admitting you messed up. That’s a guaranteed loss for the Dems.   —Depending on the timing of the replacement: If it’s after September, it’s after early voting has already started in some states. What do you do with all those printed ballots that say Biden on them? What are you going to do when someone sues their state when they want to vote for Biden but he’s no longer on the ticket but he’s still on their ballot?  —Millions of Americans have already voted for Biden in the primaries. Do we just tell them their vote doesn’t matter anymore? The public already has a bad perception of the DNC after basically blackballing all candidates in 2016 in favor of Hillary. This would look like more meddling  —Who is going to get the money from fundraising? You can’t just magically transfer funds from one person to another. It’s not a bank account  —And, most importantly, you have to ask Biden before you replace him. What would happen if Democrats replaced him and he found out through the papers or didn’t have a say? Why not ask him first, “do you want to drop out” and then if he says no then say “we really want you to drop out?” You can’t just replace someone just because you want to",cracksilog,2024-07-12T10:50:43,2

"Because the guy could probably still win, even with the bad debate performance and the gaffes since. The polls just don't show the debate and aftermath were knockout blows to Biden.  Also, there's the worry about what happens next. From my reading of the major comments from Democratic insiders and loyalists it doesn't seem like there would be an automatic promotion of Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket. So much of the commentary simply leaves her out and says three or four other candidates should be in the running for Biden's convention delegates. This risks alienating the Black vote and the women's vote, without which the Democrats cannot win anything.",deltalitprof,2024-07-12T23:50:02,1

They probably could but it is very late in the game and Biden would have to agree. There are limited avenues to do it and limited avenues to force it to happen. And no matter how you feel about him there were plenty of people that picked him in the primary. So should we ignore the wishes of those that voted for him?  The Democrats should have had an open primary and let the people decide. Obviously there is debate if the people choose the best candidate but at least with multiple people running they have the choice. For whatever reason Democrats wanted to put all their chips on the table for Biden and many of them knew he was in mental decline.  The Republicans might be a mess too but they weren't afraid to let the people decide.  It also seems counter productive to claim you want to save democracy and yet you want to remove your own candidate from the ballot.,brinerbear,2024-07-15T08:10:46,1

Harris, a BIPOC female has to step aside for a white male (Newsom) or white female (Whitmer)?  That's madness.  Michelle Obama might make it tolerable, but man, that would be a challenge.  >Move millions of dollars in campaign contributions between multiple parties  I saw it mentioned before (and I did once myself) but there is some question whether Biden's warchest could be [used by the new nominee](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/us/politics/biden-harris-money.html), even [if that's Harris](https://thehill.com/video/what-happens-to-biden%e2%80%99s-campaign-cash-if-he-drops-out/9858847/).

The US has over 116,000 polling stations that would need to be set up (and pulled from their usual task), staffed, and then counted.  That also ignores the logistical problem of setting up remote voting for everyone who needs it and the fact that some states can still reject the results (at least one state demanded that the DNC vote already or face not being on the ballot).  So short version, it takes more than 30 days to hold 50 separate elections across a continent.",ResidentBackground35,2024-07-15T10:12:06,1

"None of it is ""hand wringing."" Latest NPR polling reflects everything I said, as well as the fact that Biden hasn't lost any ground post debate.   The DNC by their own rules cannot simply replace Biden.",mojo4394,2024-07-13T06:53:17,3
"Polls have been pretty soundly proven to not be a good indicator of public sentiment, even pollsters admit it.

"> Biden has a 36% approval rating. No incumbent President has won reelection with such a high disapproval.  Only four presidents have lost reelection since those approval ratings became a thing: Ford, Carter, Bush Sr, and Trump. There isn’t sufficient data to link approval ratings to reelection.",halzen,2024-07-12T10:07:24,1

"Nope.  I just typed the number by hand and screwed it up.  He got 3896 out of 3939 delegates.  39 were ""undecided"", 4 were Dean Phillips and 3 was Jason Palmer.    Jason Palmer beat Joe Biden in American Samoa so got 3 delegates making him the only person since Kennedy in 1980 to beat an incumbent in any territory.  He ascribes this to having 4 virtual town halls.  On the other hand .. it was just American Samoa so didn't really amount to much.  There were a whopping 91 voters in American Samoa caucus!",EtherCJ,2024-07-12T16:18:00,14
"While I understand where you are coming from, the reality is there was a primary and he did win and pledged delegates are bound.    The two most likely and reasonable options for Biden not being the nominee are: he drops out voluntarily or he is removed from the presidency using 25th amendment.   The idea that the convention becomes contested is fantasyland.",EtherCJ,2024-07-12T22:22:55,6
It would also frankly invalidate everything we have been saying about “threats to democracy” from Trump and the Republicans if the DNC were to just install another nominee without Biden voluntarily stepping aside.,JasonPlattMusic34,2024-07-12T12:35:15,17

"Polls nowadays don't rely on cell methods alone. The best polls are a blend of methods for reaching voters, including online means.   Even so, yes response rates are very low. But as long as you get enough respondents in each demographic bucket you can weigh the results to produce a representative sample of the electorate.   Furthermore, banking the future of American democracy (not to mention abortion, LGBT rights, contraception, IVF, etc) on the largest polling miss since at least 1998 is a foolish strategy.   >Remember the ""Red Wave"" all the polls predicted in 2022?

There was a ""Red Wave"" media narrative, but it was never supported by the polls. 2022 was the best polling year in decades.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/",JeffreyElonSkilling,2024-07-12T10:05:09,4
"The catch is that this goes both ways. Prediction models that far more heavily rely on fundamentals don’t give Biden an edge either.   I’d choose Biden’s corpse over Trump. But with Trump on the ballot and extremism rising on the right, I don’t think it’s insane to consider whether Biden is a strong enough candidate to stop him this time around.",Philosophfries,2024-07-12T10:07:06,1

"Unless the Dems get a new candidate this conversation about Biden will be front and center until November. Every single gaffe, no matter how small, brings the age issue back into the news cycle. The debate turned this race into a referendum on Biden's ability to serve, which is a race we lose. No matter how hard you try it will be impossible to change that narrative when you consider that 75% of voters think he's too old to serve including half of Democrats.   If you truly want to stop Trump the only way to win is to turn this race into a choice between the two candidates. That is impossible with Joe Biden as the nominee.",JeffreyElonSkilling,2024-07-12T10:49:43,2

Heck, leadership clearly wanted someone other than Biden in 2020 but when no one else caught fire only then did they rally behind him.
