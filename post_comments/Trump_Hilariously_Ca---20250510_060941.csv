Falsifying those reports, as trump‚Äôs doctors do, should be punishable by at least a 4 year prison term and revocation of medical licenses and any government benefits and pension they may have otherwise received.   Then we need a law that a president who shows signs of dementia is removed from office.

"People said this in the first term too.  Trump has verbal diarrhoea, and he refuses to back down from mistakes which makes him seem even more stupid than he actually is, and he is very stupid already.   But there's a difference between the appropriate use of the 25th amendment, which is that he is mentally unable to function, and what Trump actually is, which is able to function exactly as his fascist backers want.  The 25th amendment isn't there because he's an idiot and an asshole, that's what impeachment is for.  The 25th amendment is because he was elected to be an idiot and an asshole and he can't remember how to be an idiot, or an asshole, or who his daughter is, or that he's president.    The 25th amendment is essentially undone by Trump providing in writing a letter saying he is, in fact, fit for office. Which at this point he is capable of signing his name to.    If he does that, congress would have to meet and effectively it's then to impeach him.    It's better if removal for political reasons such as his not faithfully carrying out the duties of the office, comes from within congress.  Otherwise what happens, they try and invoke the 25th, it goes to congress, they only have meetings about his competency, republicans fall back on 'I was elected to support the maga agenda' and it goes no where.",sir_sri,2025-05-10T11:28:19,1

"So why not say that, instead of what you did which implied (intentional or not) that the article was a lie?  Trump misspeaks a lot.  Biden did, and also got shit for it.  I can't think of any president who has always spoken perfectly.  It's news only because the rich and powerful folks who run most mass media see that it gets them clicks and revenue.  Their only political stance is money.  but this article was factually true, that's all I'm trying to say.",dearbluey,2025-05-10T11:06:42,1

Right idk what his plan is I‚Äôm just saying what I think he meant.

You have no idea what he definitely thinks or not. Why don't you just stop trying to apologize for fascism and dictators. It would be much better if you did. No one wants to hear your whining about this article or pointing out his stupid shit.

I mean it would help the cause a lot more if you focused on actual fascist shit to criticize instead of acting like the dumbass Trump supporters that tried to make a big deal every time Biden misspoke. It‚Äôs actually hurting the cause to focus of this. It‚Äôs very obvious to anyone with critical thinking ability to see that this absolutely is not Trump thinking Mattel is a country. All you people are doing is showing your as dumb and easily tricked as the fascist supporters,dpk794,2025-05-10T09:03:31,0
