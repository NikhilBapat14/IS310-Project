"When people talk about the media being complicit and in large part responsible for how we’ve arrived at this moment in history, this is what they are talking about.   I get that this doorknob said this outrageous thing and given his proximity to power it is “newsworthy”, But the rest of the article goes on to entertain the premise of Miller’s point. And the appropriate response should be that Miller is asking to change a clear and core component of the very document that gives his boss any authority - and to affect that change with methods that are not authorized by the same document.   This entire article should read, “Stephen Miller wants to change the Constitution. As we all know here’s are the methods that are written into the Constitution to revise, revoke or introduce an amendment to accomplish that change. There is no way that Miller or his ilk can get that done and so his problems with the amendment are moot. If Miller and pals try any other way around getting what he wants, our system of government has failed and we no longer live in a democratic republic.”    Nothing about that isn’t honest or factual. I get that news outlets want to appear fair and unbiased. But they seem to not understand that rational people already think they’re biased  because news outlets so clearly and continually entertain absolute lunacy.   Stop accepting every premise to an argument! They aren’t made in good faith and they’re specifically to manipulate the news cycle. It’s so frustrating to see well meaning journalists capitulate to their billionaire bosses, not having enough self-respect to just say, “That’s clearly ridiculous and wrong, how can you possibly expect to be taken seriously?” ",johhnny5,2025-04-27T13:59:44,10

"This doesn't even make any sense. Illegal immigrants, including the parents of US citizens, have been paying payroll taxes for decades even though they are not eligible for Social Security and Medicare. In a lot of cases they are even paying income taxes. They pay more than they will ever get out of the system, even if you assume all the ""anchor baby"" mothers spend their entire pregnancy on Medicaid. Because here's the thing, even if your child is a US citizen, if you are a Honduran or Mexican or Salvadoran national it's going to be a decades long wait for legal residency IF you ever even get approved, and until you have that residency your wages aren't going to your Social Security and Medicare eligibility.    So, yes, your tax dollars are paying for the cost of destitute US citizens'  mothers to give birth in Medicaid. They are paying for them to get free formula and milk and cheese and produce. WIC. And MAYBE a couple hundred bucks of food assistance for six months (because that's all Welfare gets you anymore.) Maybe. A large portion of low income people do not get approved for food assistance. A lot don't ever even apply. In return their relatives are paying for our Social Security and Medicare and other government services. And providing future workers to keep the whole thing going. We are coming out ahead.    At least we were until these people decided to go after and eliminate the means by which illegal immigrants were paying into all our systems. It's almost as if they don't actually care about the fiscal soundness of all this at all. They just want all immigrants not of their particular ethnic persuasion out. ",Sad_Pangolin7379,2025-04-27T19:45:22,3

"The cognitive dissonance of “white” people is among their most impressive skills:  “Our use of the lowercase for adjectives such as “english,” “christian,” “protestant,” “catholic,” “european,” “spanish,” and “american” is intentional.  While the noun might be capitalized out of some respect, using the lowercase allows us to avoid any unnecessary normalizing or universalizing of the principal institutional, political, or social quotient of the euro-west.  Paradoxically, we insist on capitalizing the “w” in White (adjective or noun) to indicate a clear cultural pattern invested in Whiteness that is all too often ignored or even denied by American Whites.” (Tink Tinker and Mark Freeland, 44)  https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131245",oliversurpless,2025-04-27T13:35:48,4
