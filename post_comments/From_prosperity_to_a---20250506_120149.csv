">Trump’s tone, and that of his aides, has shifted notably in recent weeks, as they warn of sacrifice and “transition” until, by their telling, his heavy tariffs pave the way for a boom. Trump has spoken of the need to take economic “medicine,” warned Americans they may need to cut back on items like dolls and pencils, and suggested a short-term recession might be an acceptable cost for the prosperity he predicts will come.   >Regarding consumers, he added: “I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.”   Regarding Americans, Trump told everyone we don't need a great, or even a mediocre President - we should be happy with a grifter, felon, and insurrectionist who is intentionally destroying the country in every way possible.",Icantweetthat,2025-05-06T12:03:12,8
He is both ignorant of how tariffs work and completely uncaring about their deleterious impact on average Americans. He's just the worst.,AllynCrane,2025-05-06T12:07:55,5
It's like they're admitting they had no idea what they were doing with those tariffs.,CautiousToe6644,2025-05-06T12:15:28,5
"The rich can have 7 yachts, but the people who create all the wealth for them to steal? Sorry, but 250 pencils is a “no go.”   (That’s just over $10 in #2 pencils if you buy them 24 at a time from Walmart. And MAGA, who pretended the economy was terrible under Biden, says, “thanks daddy, you’re right, spending $10.67 of my own hard earned money on pencils is selfish. Now please give the billionaires trillions in tax-payer funded welfare!”)",ddark4,2025-05-06T12:23:50,3
I don’t understand. By all metrics the US was doing great economically. Why the austerity now? Like I don’t think I have seen more self-inflicted damage than this. ,SpiritedEclair,2025-05-07T02:59:29,1

Where’s the boom come from? How’s that supposed to work?   How does having huge numbers of minimum wage factory workers (while decimating our much more lucrative services sector) create an economic boom?   The answer is it doesn’t. It makes us a poor country with lots of poor people… who now get to toil in factories.   Can some journalist figure this part out and start asking people if they have any interest in that?,-Gramsci-,2025-05-06T17:06:31,2
"This is exactly what Trump’s boss asked him to do.  If you think Putin wants nothing in return for financing trumps failed real estate business for decades, you’re a shallow thinker.",Electrical-Cat9572,2025-05-06T21:42:20,2
