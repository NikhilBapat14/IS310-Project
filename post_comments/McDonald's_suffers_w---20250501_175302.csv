"They are in a tough situation worldwide. The brand is synonymous with the US while Trump has done so much to sour people's opinion of us. The Canadian market has to be brutal, with Europe less so, but still losing out to less American brands.  Here in the states, they have priced themselves far too high. Just looked at the McDonalds app for my location, after updating it as I haven't eaten there in years, but a Big Mac meal deal is over $10.   Applebees has a $9.99 deal for a burger, fries and drink. Not a fan of them, either, but I'd take a fast casual burger over a fast food burger any day. McDonald's prices are insane.",travio,2025-05-01T18:01:04,71

"It's not *entirely* political.  McDonald's used to be ok fast food, served cheap and fast.  Now, it's neither cheap nor fast, and the quality of the food worsened. And I have to make my own orders. And I live in a big city and there are TONS of better options for only a bit more of money (and sometimes for same amount of money, depending) right down the block.  I live right across the street from a McDonald's. I haven't set a foot there in months, even before Trump.   I'm sure that there are people who are boycotting McD because of Trump/America/BuyNonAmerican. But there are others who just don't see the point of McDonald's in today's economy anymore. Stagnate the wages means we have less expandable money for luxury. Bad and expensive fast food is an easy ""luxury"" to get rid off. The head of capitalism-snake is starting to bite its own tail.

"Shit, that and the fact that a QPC meal and a #7 meal run you fucking $21 if not more. Fast food has gone off their rocker. Canes can run you $33 for some unseasoned fries and chicken. Taco Bell nickles you to $26. Five Guys thinks they can charge $45 for 2 Burgers, White Castle wants to hit you for $25 for burgers that could be classified as dog food. Panda Express, skimps on its portions as if the place is going to go bankrupt. Firehouse Subs practically makes you foot the bill for your local fire department. Burger King just isn't even edible anymore. Arby's has  lost touch with reality, trying to get you to drop $50+ for a soggy sweet roast beef. The Colonel is hitting max rpm in his grave thinking how his franchise has to be quarantined.   Literally I think the only 3 fast foods that aren't trying to bend us over and give it to us unlubed right now are Dairy Queen, Wendy's and Steak and Shake.  Some CEO will come up with some swill ""oh they need healthy options"" nah man, we need you to remember your place and stay in your lane. Cheap barely edible food that is filling for like $7 bucks for a large sized meal and we need it in 3 minutes or less.",Skeletor_with_Tacos,2025-05-01T23:45:30,10

"There didn‚Äôt seem to be any mention of their fairly significant price increases in the article.

My husband‚Äôs family used to eat there frequently and on a visit to Oklahoma to see them he was shocked when they went to a McDonald‚Äôs and the bill for some chicken nuggets, a burger and drinks was around 20$. That‚Äôs absurd-especially for middle of nowhere Oklahoma.  All corporations are price-gouging. Anti-trust laws have become a punchline in our current late-stage capitalistic dystopia. However the one somewhat hilarious by-product is seeing these kinds of articles- where the same corporations doing that price-gouging act so confused that they are losing customers.  The only reason McDonalds got away with the crap quality of their food was the sheer affordability of it. Yet when they remove that factor without adjusting quality to compensate?

Why do people think Chick-fil-a is actually good when there so much better fast food chicken options?,SHOW_ME_PIZZA,2025-05-02T08:52:29,9
"The whole reason McDonalds got so big was it was cheap, it was consistent, it was everywhere. If you where traveling, needed something quick, don‚Äôt want to look around for options, you went to McDonalds. I remember the whole ‚ÄúLarge Coke for a Dollar‚Äù era because instead of buying soda to keep at home my grandparents just drove 3 mins to a McDonald for a large coke and iced tea.",Proper_Caterpillar22,2025-05-02T01:57:18,13

Yep.  The only solace I think in the suffering I know is coming is that the dumb fucks who thought Trump II was a good idea will suffer also.,NimusNix,2025-05-02T07:36:31,1
Yeah I support the international boycott. The only way shit is going to change is if people are made to hurt because of Trump. It has to be undeniably his fault and the pain also has to be u deniable.

"Okay but, that's *your* country. You've been on this slide for decades, and the vast majority of Americans have done nothing to fight against it. You can say ""it's more complicated than the voting numbers"" all you want, but what percentage of people do you think are actually doing more than voting and complaining online?   At some point this supposed majority of Americans that oppose Trump need to wake up and start actually doing something. Because if you think your elections are rigged against you now, what do you think they're going to look like in 2028?

"This. Look at interiors of houses now and what do you see. Shades of gray to black floors; maybe dark brown. Walls are shades of gray to grayish blue. Appliances black, steel, or combo of black and steel. Look at cars. You choices are black, grey to silver, beige, white. Even your primary colors (red, blue, yellow, orange, green, violet) are dark shades.   Somewhere along the way lost color, brightness, and uniqueness.

"I don‚Äôt have that answer. I have no idea. I can‚Äôt make anyone do anything, I can‚Äôt make anyone care. No one you talk to on Reddit can. My first election was Hillary v Trump. I have spent my entire adult life organizing and trying to make people care. And I will still go down with the ship just like everyone else. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do, but I will still do it. The system is fucked. Most of Europe and elsewhere have a lot of safety nets that enable you to not feel the way many Americans do about dropping everything and rioting. Still‚Ä¶ Do I think there is an excuse for American apathy? No.   Our population is so uneducated and propagandized that many do not see it for what it is. It‚Äôs not some sort of intentionally evil, selfish thing for the 60%, even closer to like 85%. If they truly understood what was happening, they would not be so apathetic. They would care. We aren‚Äôt all sociopaths. They simply do not get the severity, and it‚Äôs not being reported by the major news networks OR is being actively minimized by the conservative ones. Unless you are chronically online in the right circle, you don‚Äôt know how bad it is yet.   DC is thousands of miles away from most of us. It‚Äôs not happening in anyone‚Äôs back yard. People don‚Äôt know. They can‚Äôt afford to fly cross country to protest where it be super effective. Even my state capitol is a 4 hour drive away, for example.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the US, we will always be fine‚Äù has been engrained into us. The majority of Americans are also insanely religious and believe god won‚Äôt let anything bad happen so it must be fine. That plus zero awareness and you get a lot of people who appear apathetic.   Voting is not seen the same way as in other places, it‚Äôs not mandatory. Folks here have a different relationship with it. Is it right? No. But you have to also consider culture and norms if you want to understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.   There is a lot of nuance is all.   If you want to just say ‚ÄúAll Americans suck and are doing nothing and just let this happen‚Äù that is fine. You can group Americans as a whole, I don‚Äôt care. We deserve it. Genuinely. We are an evil country, broadly. Feel your feelings. But speaking as though there aren‚Äôt any reasons ‚Äúwhy‚Äù beyond ‚ÄúAmericans don‚Äôt care‚Äù is strange to me. I don‚Äôt disagree with anything else.   You will all move on without us eventually and be better for it. The destruction of American influence is a net positive in the long run.   I can only control myself. If he starts a war, I‚Äôll die or face whatever other consequence before I am forced to condone or participate in your destruction. I‚Äôve dreamed my whole life about getting out, even when things were ‚Äúgood‚Äù. I have never related to people here and feel nothing but grief as we isolate ourselves further, while people here just live their lives like normal. My dreams are crushed. The rest of my life will be miserable. My entire family is on social security, medicare, or medicaid and rely on it to support them. I have no future anymore. I am an only child so it‚Äôll all be on me if they lose access.   I have spent my entire fucking life fighting back against this, and I, and those I love, will be among the first to suffer. There are zero rewards for trying, so a lot of good, passionate, willing to burn if all down people just get squashed. So yeah, these anger and frustration induced hot takes are annoying to read even though it‚Äôs understandable and logical to feel the way you do.   Once this shit hits everyone‚Äôs pockets, many more will start waking up. Many already have. Seems it‚Äôs gonna take some time. Lots of people here, spread out very far from one another. It sucks, but that is the reality.",semicharmed777,2025-05-02T13:48:27,2
