"Americans; you must attach the republicans to every Trump action. When his era is eventually over, they will try to wipe their hands of it. Revisionist history 101.  Remind them, remind yourselves and remind everyone that he is only there on their doing, and he's not acting alone. It needs to be guilt by association.   Please, please, please... Associate republicans with Trump on everything. Make sure the blood is on their hands at the end of all of this.   If you don't, once he's gone it's going to be business as usual, and they wipe their hands of him and then the next nutjob appears as their new saviour.",jigsaw153,2025-04-27T02:28:15,19
"We the People have been marching, writing and calling our Reps and Senators, and being general disapproving all across social media.   What are the people with actual authority and power doing, watching all this and going, ""oh, my! Someone that's not me aught to do something!"" What has Congress been doing, sleeping with their heads under their nice safe wings since January 20th? What's that ever helpful media doing, other than posting Trump images and finding unbelievable excuses for all the ""naughtiness""?",BadAsBroccoli,2025-04-26T23:20:48,18
"What chills me to the bone is that trump staged a coup 4 years ago to try to install himself as dictator, failed, ran for election in 2024 on the promise to rule as a dictator, and won.  Even if trump goes away 'like a miracle', the electorate that handed power to the wannabe dictator will remain. Terrifying and depressing.",VanceKelley,2025-04-27T02:11:48,13

"This admin gave away his strategy when they said they “can’t process all the illegal immigrants with due process, it would take hundreds of years” The strategy is the admin can get away with a lot of unconstitutional moves by overwhelming the judicial system with challenges.  Which is likely why we have barely heard a challenge including the judge that charged the admin contempt of court by not returning the MD man from El Salvador.  That’s the only challenge I’ve heard out of dozens of events that should be challenged.  The courts are overwhelmed.  I always said the first term was practice for the second term.  A third would be catastrophic and collapse.",Nedspoint_5805,2025-04-27T08:14:57,3

"My understanding of America as an outsider.  What Trump is doing is absolutely not new to America.  America has always had this in it. This idea of having:  * A stratified society. With a poor working class who have basically no government support and have to tolerate awful working conditions * Racist policies whereby a cohort of American citizens are treated as second class citizens who have fewer rights than everyone else. * An isolation approach to global policy. * Global market manipulation & a lack of co-operation with other countries. * Religious based policy.  As an outsider looking in to America and its history. There is a constant ongoing fight between what people think America is in a global context and what role it should play & also what being an American means and what basic rights and liberties the state should facilitate you having.  The only new 2 thing that seem surprising from my perspective is:  * Canada & Europe seems to getting hostile attention as well as China instead of Russia. It is odd that currently America is not ideologically aligned with the West, effectively. * The cohort of American's that Trump's supporters are okay with being targeted & having their rights reduced and liberty diminished is less defined. Previously it was normally fixed traits: Sex, race, gender. Then it was religion. Know its people link to institutions who are associated with opposing ideology. It's a bit like Pol Pot light. Former or current government official, people linked to education, opposing media.  The half of America that isn't fucking mental are ultimately always able to ensure the fundamentals are maintained. I don't think America will actually attack or abandon and ally. It won't stop being a democracy or fall to tyranny. 100% shit loads of minorities and disadvantaged people are going to suffer, soft power will diminish, maybe a recession to come. But the concept of America will stay.  What America needs and will probably get is a kind of third option. Some new guy who doesn't seem linked to what is now and was before. Like Trump was - just less horrendously awful",Dungarth32,2025-04-27T06:47:27,2

I think it’s running in reverse: the power behind the throne is dangling the puppet. He gets to play Big Boss Man as long as he signs whatever is put in front of him (see: the stack of EO’s he’d clearly never read being signed on inauguration day).,Moist_When_It_Counts,2025-04-27T05:45:03,3
And some of those sycophants are morons. Like arguably if he would pull of a coup you would think he would choose a smart man to lead the defense department. Instead he chose Pete hesgeth. He has smart sycophants. But I don’t see a coup happening with some idiots he’s also chosen. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-27T03:11:11,1

Vought sure. But the man he put in charge of the military. Hesgeth does not and again hesgeth has an actual important job if there ever is a coup. I don’t think it’s happening with some of the idiots at the helm ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-27T03:05:00,-1
