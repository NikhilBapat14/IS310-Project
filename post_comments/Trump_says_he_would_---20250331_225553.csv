"this shouldn't even be a discussion - the whole ""hypothetical"" of this is just normalizing djt's 3rd term narrative that can not and must not be given any air.  At all, whatsoever",WetFinsFine,2025-04-01T02:04:54,108
"Pretty sure he is only saying that to give legitimacy to a third term, as if the Dems will jump on the chance and  just let him run again. It's against the constitution, period, it should stay that way.  As awesome as it would be too see Obama decimate him.",salochin82,2025-04-01T02:19:50,22

"This is the dumbest shit the Dems need to shut down immediately. First, Obama should publicly state, per the Constitution, that he can‚Äôt seek a third term and he simply won‚Äôt. It should be one succinct message. Period. Second, Trump is pushing this crap because he‚Äôs about to unleash a world of pain with his so-called ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù nonsense. We need to shut this down, move on, and focus on the real hell this guy is unleashing on the country.  PS I love Obama and miss him.

Obama would never give another ounce to this ungrateful country. Trump just wants another chance to go untethered and say what nasty things he wants about Obama and his family to try and humiliate him more. Media is even worse than it was back then.

Neither can run because it‚Äôs anti-constitutional. You can only run for two terms whether consecutive or non-consecutive.  Anything else is a dictatorship. End of discussion.,Debt_Otherwise,2025-04-01T07:18:12,1

But that doesn't mean we have to go around acting like Trump and all his moronic cultists, we're better than that. Trump is corrupt as hell, he's absolutely trying to make it difficult for certain people to vote, and we need to fight like crazy to make sure that doesn't happen, but this election wasn't rigged.
