"*From Bloomberg News reporter Amara Omeokwe:*  Steep cuts to federal funding and staffing threaten to weaken the US social safety net at a time when Americans are increasingly bracing for a tariff-induced economic slowdown.  The Trump administration’s efforts to curtail federal spending have included slashing funding for programs that provide assistance to food banks and school nutrition initiatives and downsizing offices that support low-income families.  Popular aid programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could also face cutbacks as Republicans in Congress look to pay for promised tax cuts. The president is expected to detail his plans for such programs soon as part of his fiscal 2026 budget proposal.  “There are changes coming from multiple directions at once, but all of which have the real possibility of affecting families in general and — in the worst-case scenario of how they might converge — having potentially really devastating financial effects for families,” said Megan Curran, director of policy at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University.  The moves come just as tariffs, and the uncertainty around them, stoke pessimism about the outlook for the US economy. So far, unemployment remains low and retail sales healthy.
