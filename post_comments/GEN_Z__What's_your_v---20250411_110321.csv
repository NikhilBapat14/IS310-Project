"I'm a boomer and embarrassed. My generation started on a great foot, fighting the Vietnam War, Woodstock, the counterculture revolution, civil rights, voting rights, all of it. Yet today I think we are completely fucked up - the white dumb boomers have screwed up the country.",ChanceG1955,2025-04-11T14:03:48,11
I just accept that we have to wait for the lead brains to die out and hope things aren’t to bad to recover from by the time my kids are older.,SandiegoJack,2025-04-11T11:26:32,8
"Millennials really got screwed over by everyone. Dot com bubble, 9/11, Iraq War, Great Recession, Trump, Covid, 2nd Trump. From elementary all to their adult life/ midlife.",daggeroflies,2025-04-11T11:30:37,11

"My American dream is now to get out when I retire. Live abroad, I have family. Already saving for real estate. It's gonna get real expensive to live here in the future. Wealth gap will only increase.",catsoncrack420,2025-04-11T11:20:42,3
"Correction for the youth of today:  Gen X does not exist.  It is a made up generation.  There are zero people in the U.S. between the ages 42ish and 60.  They all whatever'd out of here decades ago and no one noticed. Also, Millennial stops at 35.  Any 'Millennial' older than 35 is also a Boomer.    Joking, mostly.   But yeah, this infographic is from 2018.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T12:15:03,2

"The American dream is the ability to get an education, get a good job, and retire comfortably when you're ready. The ability to own a home and have a family if one chooses to without it ruining their financial security. All in a nation that respects the personal choices of its diverse population where no one group can tell someone how to live their life.   Most people don't want much but to be comfortable and secure, while being free to live the life they want to live.",MC-SpicyBravo,2025-04-11T12:31:06,1

"My vision of the American Dream is to go back to the FDR era tax code. It is only right that we take the burden off of middle class families and small businesses and make big businesses and people that can give a lot, give at least some. The New Deal gave us a prosperous 50s, it is not right that only the boomers and silent generation get the enjoy the benefits of inheriting the wealth of the land.",Curious-Following952,2025-04-11T16:08:16,1
"Social democracy in a style similar to Western European countries. Get money out of politics. Tax the Rich effectively (even if we could enforce current laws). Housing, food, clean water, clean air, and medical care should be treated as a human right that EVERYONE gets. Promote building nice, affordable rental units like in Europe rather than overpriced, under built, uninsurable McMansions. Improve public transit and train infrastructure. Also, everyone should be treated like HUMANS regardless of race, gender, or wealth.",Kitty-Kat_Kisses,2025-04-11T23:22:18,1
"i think that taking in refugees, which would increase racial diversity, is good for our society, otherwise i think the correct answer is “neutral”…let people have kids who want to have kids, etc. it’s not really our place to make a judgement there",iridescentrae,2025-04-14T22:06:38,1
"Thank you for pointing this out. Even in the best of times, a 7 year old survey of this nature would be useless. But a 7 year old survey after everything that has happened since then? It’s meaningless.",diaymujer,2025-04-11T11:20:31,22
"Gen X here - I feel bad at how boomers got screwed with McCarthy's communist BS, shell shock / PTSD from useless wars, and nonsense Jim Crow laws,  but at least kids weren't shooting each other in school!",RedRoom4U,2025-04-11T22:07:26,1
"We really did get screwed. The only time we ever had it somewhat decent was the Obama administration but even then most of us were in high school or college. By the time we were ready to get our own place and start our own families, we're hit by a disastrous first Trump ""'presidency"", Covid hit, and then Trump undoing everything Biden did to try to clean up the mess he left him with. We are now dealing with the most blatantly corrupt, morally bankrupt, greedy, cruel, and anti-American administration this country has ever seen. We really did get screwed over.",Torracattos,2025-04-11T12:03:35,6
"As a nurse, I see this 1st hand. Healthcare should be free. If other smaller countries can do it, so can we. The rich are just too greedy by feeding off the poor.",RedRoom4U,2025-04-11T21:52:22,1
"Mostly since weapons were in the hands of responsible adults. Now, too many idiots have access to way too many guns.",ChanceG1955,2025-04-12T05:54:24,1
"At least Millennials mostly don't remember a time when they woke up every morning wondering if today is the day the nukes will fly.  Or if that wasn't it, then AIDS.  If not that, then killer bees were gonna get us.  If not that, there was always the quicksand.  Or being told that you were a loser and slacker while simultaneously being ignored by the group of people who are your parents, and having to witness that generation below you getting high praise and 'everyone is a winner' from this same group of people.  And a couple more recessions.  Every generation experiences its own piles of shit.  Doesn't make one generation better or worse than another.   We are all humans moving through life together.  The best we can do is to not fuck it up any more and make it worse for the rest.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T12:21:26,2
