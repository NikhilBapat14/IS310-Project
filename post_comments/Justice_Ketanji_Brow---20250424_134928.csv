"Look, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to go way out on a limb and suggest that a Supreme Court justice should have some basic grasp of the details being argued in front of them before jumping into the fray.

"Since WW2, the pattern is crystal clear: Republican Presidents appoint justices who are both independent and principled scholars of the Law. They range from those who have gone liberal to centrists  to impressive conservative judges who ruling ms are deeply rooted in reason.   In great contrast, Democrat Presidents nominate ideologues and political aware justices who are often activists in the cause of the Democratic Party. Not a single one has moved to the center.",Idaho1964,2025-04-24T18:50:20,1

When you factor in the fact that she is basically an unintelligent person who coasted into the Supreme Court off the back of a fake college degree that clearly did not test her‚Ä¶  And the fact that this gap is just filled with left wing ideology‚Ä¶  Feels pretty evil to me.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-24T14:21:43,49
