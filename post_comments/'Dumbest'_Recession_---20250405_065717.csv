Republican Recession and Trump Tariffs. Go on Fox News and dumb this s\*it down for people.,BeerluvaNYC,2025-04-05T07:27:30,117
Please dems message this well. Do not send us to a website for a 30 page report on recession. Dumb this way down for that flag waving truck in front of me.,docsnotright,2025-04-05T08:36:37,78
Dems better have a good counter to the Repubs cries for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent because that’s part of the plan to crashing the economy.,Pretty_Boy_Bagel,2025-04-05T07:15:17,35
I don't have any great ideas myself. I hope they can come up with something more than a stern letter.,lemons714,2025-04-05T08:18:48,9

Republicans bread and butter are recessions. There’s a reason it’s a curve. They need something to do and it’s destroy,zangief137,2025-04-05T08:45:43,6
I'm not convinced the dems can take advantage of this.  They are way too soft and subtle with their messages that the average Americans will gloss over.,Nearbyatom,2025-04-05T09:12:01,8

"Imagine back-to-back commercials in September, October, and November with no voiceover—only Trump bragging about the economic “miracle” he will unleash starting **day one**.  Other ads can argue otherwise, but the most devastating may be Donald all by himself.",AntifascistAlly,2025-04-05T12:46:25,1
"Ih they're preparing are they? Getting ready to make a plan to send out an email to ask to ask people to sign a petition to... FUCKING PREPARING GO TO WORK   if a dem had done this Ted Cruz, lindsey grahm, and six others would have already had 8 fox news interviews calling him the dumbest man to ever live. Stop preparing to do shitand actually do it you dusty old beuracratic ballsacks!",victorbarst,2025-04-05T21:58:26,1
No they're not going to do anything they have had ample opportunities to do something anything to stop the orange nazi from fucking our country over and all they have done is sit on their ass.,Azerothwolf73,2025-04-05T09:56:52,0

They're going to write a strongly worded email of discontent with it!,teytah,2025-04-05T12:10:16,-1

"That's exactly it. The Republicans specifically legislate away their power to stop tariffs at the ""CR"" that was passed earlier this year. All of this is the responsibility of all Republicans. They think they can make Musk the fall guy, and they are wrong. This is Republican governance top to bottom. They can stop things and choose not to.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-05T07:33:21,46
"Unless it’s on Fox, OAN or newsmax etc it may never reach them. The biggest challenge to elections isn’t candidates or platforms. It’s half the country is getting propaganda for news.",50eggs,2025-04-05T10:54:56,19
"I unfortunately don't have faith due to our apathetic older leadership who won't go or change. But back in the 2006 midterms they actually did do this with simple messaging and getting mean. I remember Democrats were running ad's of Dubya is the reason why you can't afford to pay your mortgage, Dubya is the reason why you struggle to put food on the table, so and so senator or Congress person is the reason why your son and daughter got shipped off to Afghanistan to have their legs blown off by an IED.  The need to be mean for once, and just be annoying and obnoxious with calling the tariffs a tax, and it's why you can't afford your new whatever iPhone switch whatever, why you struggle to feed your family, why you can't fill up your gas tank all the way etc.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-05T10:32:41,8
Some dude was trying to say that it’s our fault because we didn’t have a primary.  The GOP with their unelected copresident still thinks that’s a winning talking point.,Easy-Concentrate2636,2025-04-05T10:40:38,5
Agreed.  As time goes on it seems less and less like there are really two parties with different goals.,phxees,2025-04-05T09:27:39,1
"I mean, the strategy here is to let people suffer. That is sort of a hard message to put neatly in a bow. A lot of us here get it, but a lot of Republicans think we are being mean. You know, the same people who voted for a man when they knew he would sending people to death camps and deporting people.",Rosebunse,2025-04-05T09:49:24,1
They always speak to the well educated and forgot how to speak to toddlers and brain amputee people. Trump with his 100 words in the dictionary learned that early and never advanced… that helped him through out the years,Silver-Forever9085,2025-04-05T10:42:14,1

"That’s an interesting point.  If we look like we are being snide, they will immediately play victim.  The Dem leadership definitely have to talk about it as the suffering the GOP is causing.  Connect the GOP to high bills and suffering.",Easy-Concentrate2636,2025-04-05T10:42:43,3
"Yeah, but we have to be careful. We also have to let some of the suffering hit them or we sound crazy",Rosebunse,2025-04-05T10:48:37,2
I think the tariffs need to hit the groceries before a lot of people understand the impact.  I am seeing some conservatives on Reddit not connecting the trillions lost in two days because they don’t have 401ks.,Easy-Concentrate2636,2025-04-05T10:52:38,3
