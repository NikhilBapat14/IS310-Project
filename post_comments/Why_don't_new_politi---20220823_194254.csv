"A question I can answer! I'm a political consultant, and have had very lengthy talks with some of the libertarian state party leaders. I have suggested to them that they are putting the cart before the horse, and need to establish a strong base before building up to statewide races. I agree with you, but they respond with 2 major points:  1. In many states there is a threshold of 3-5%, that if a party reaches or exceeds in the top election on the ballot last cycle, they are given easier ballot access in the future. (eg. in Illinois, if you are in a Major Party(your party reached that threshold) you need 5000* petition signatures for statewide races and can start collecting in late fall, but if you are a New Party(you didn't reach that threshold) you will need 15,000 petition sigs and cannot begin collecting till mid-winter. *Dates and numbers may have changed slightly since I last looked it up.)  1. Top of the ticket races are sexier. They bring in donors, volunteers, and afford them easier access to earned media (free spots on tv and in other news media)  Between those two reasons, it becomes almost a necessity for third parties to run someone in the statewide race, and only then do their best to recruit lower level candidates. On that subject, recruiting candidates is hard. Like really hard. The major parties have an issue with it everywhere, and while a lot of that is due to old, rusty party infrastructure, that decline in an interest in being part of the party infrastructure is often due to not having enough local candidates, a vicious cycle. How much worse for those 3rd parties who have little or no infrastructure.  Tldr. Top ticket races are sexy and bring in the dough, recruiting candidates is hard af, and ballot access is given only to those who do well in those top races.",CaitlinHuxley,2022-08-24T10:44:17,19
The same people who vote locally tend to vote federally.,[deleted],2022-08-24T09:03:20,9
You can’t sustain 3rd parties with winner take all voting. There will always be spoilers. We’ll need rank choice or some other scheme to break this deadlock.,ElectronGuru,2022-08-24T11:51:30,2
"Yes, you are correct, and that's why I say parties like the Libertarians or Greens are really just joke parties. They're not real alternatives. Why they choose to be joke parties instead of actual parties is beyond me, but have you *actually* talked to a Libertarian recently? They couldn't be more out of touch with reality if they tried. Maybe that gives you a clue.  Regardless, we actually have seen some ""third parties"" try to make this kind of attempt in the US. The Tea Party is the best example. They actually did this party structure quite effectively, creating grassroots local gatherings that met on a unique platform and started at the lower election levels and going up from there. And it was quite effective. Similarly, the recent revival of the progressives on the left has shown a similar pattern. It's well known that you've seen a political revival of sorts with local involvement in DSA meetings, for example. Even Trumpism has done this a better than expected.  Now, because the US is a two party system, there really isn't space for a third party to be *truly* independent and successful, so actual political constituencies with third party potential end up merging with the main party at some point. But even within the US's rigid two party system we're seeing that the Libs and Greens pretty much just exist to acquire political donations from suckers and nothing more.  Also, this is a pretty clear indication to me why Forward will fail. They're doing the exact opposite of what they should be doing. Starting at the top and going down doesn't work even if you have a large Twitter marketing budget, usually. Forward looks a lot like a better funded version of the Libs and Greens and not very much like the rising socialists or the Tea Partiers or even the Trumpists. Forward's third way is straight into the ground.",mormagils,2022-08-24T09:05:36,4
Because that’s generally not their purpose. Their purpose is to generally spoil more important contests.,DrMuteSalamander,2022-08-24T08:39:37,-1
"They do focus on local elections. The Green Party and Libertarian Party both have state-level parties in each state that support candidates in local elections. The national versions of those parties are pretty much separate entities from the local versions. They run the presidential candidates and exist mainly to raise awareness for the party and for its causes, not to actually win.  Third party candidates do sometimes win in local elections, but first-past-the-post elections tend to lead to a two-party system. Also, politics in the US have become very nationalized over the past few decades, so it's hard for third party candidates to win elections just by focusing on local issues.   The [Vermont Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Progressive_Party) is one of the few examples of a third party succeeding at the local level. They control the mayorship and city council of Burlington (the state's largest city) and hold a few seats in the state legislature.  Bernie Sanders has been affiliated with the party since the 80s, but he's never actually been a member since it's a state party and he's a federal official.",[deleted],2022-08-24T19:37:34,1
"The Working Families Party is doing what you described, I think. I believe AOC was a member once, but not sure if that's still true.  https://workingfamilies.org/",rogun64,2022-08-29T11:07:00,1
Speaking as a former chairman of a national third party I can verify that the above answer is correct. It's hard to do anything politically without money and it's incredibly hard to raise money without a big race and media attention.   That being said there are some more local parties that sometimes work. But what makes them work is being super focused on local issues which then makes it hard for them to expand.,MWBartko,2022-08-24T19:38:31,3

"I guess the idea is that they might be competitive enough that they would become one of the two major parties in one or a couple states, counties or electoral districts, while not having a chance in the rest of the country(at first). I.E., the Libertarians replace the Democrats as the main opposition to Republicans in Wyoming, while the Democratic party remains more important than the Libertarians overall.",Forward-Razzmatazz18,2022-10-05T13:42:29,1
"While the Green Party may seem to be a joke to you, they hold \~130 offices, mostly school boards, but still they are no joke. Libertarians, OTOH, have about 320 members in office. Not sure which positions they hold.",Swiggy1957,2022-08-24T11:11:25,4
So...you think the Green Party is actually trying to spoil for Republicans and the Libertarians for Democrats?,Forward-Razzmatazz18,2022-10-05T13:45:36,1

"It seems the only ones that they don't win are the ones that they don't run in. Apparently, the voters like the idea that there children will get a real education.",Swiggy1957,2022-08-24T17:34:51,1
"But school boards do somewhat control the curriculum of the schools, right? That could be considered important. How come they couldn't enact some of their platform with that.",Forward-Razzmatazz18,2022-10-05T13:49:42,1
"Well, you said they're goal was to spoil more important contests. Most people who vote Green would've voted for Democrats if forced to choose between the two major parties. Same with Libertarians and Republicans. So, they draw voters away from there closest ideological partners, and spoil it for the other major party.",Forward-Razzmatazz18,2022-10-06T07:57:35,1
That's silly. Greens don't have a platform they can actually act upon because they don't win any races higher than school board. Are you truly suggesting that Greens are the only political party that actually supports improving education? Come on. Are you a Green supporter or something?,mormagils,2022-08-24T22:50:48,2
"I mean, sure, school board is important, but you're missing the point. The discussion is about political parties, and about how they organize into a cohesive and structured unit that can advocate for a particular set of policies on a large scale and mobilize the members of that party to answer major political questions of the day. Pointing out that there are some Greens on school boards isn't really a refutation of my claims because school boards aren't really broad enough to interact with the larger political system nor are the elections complex enough to adequately draw conclusions about political behavior.  Put another way, the more local the politics, the more anomalous it starts to get. Party labels mean less and less and are less consistent. I mean, in many of the places where a Green candidate can win a local election, those same voters won't vote Green in the national. That's because the connection between the overall party platform and the specifics of the local race is just very, very tenuous.  My point isn't that nobody ever can be affiliated with the Greens and win anywhere at all. My point is that they don't command a consistent enough connection between policy and voting and all that at the most impactful levels to be considered a true political party. This is the same standard used by actual political scientists when evaluating the number of parties in a party system. Can they get a place in the national legislature? Even one seat? If no, then they're not really counted as a political party.",mormagils,2022-10-05T14:08:39,1

">That's because the connection between the overall party platform and the specifics of the local race is just very, very tenuous.

"Well, I meant spoil it as in spoil it in a way that would make them win, not that it would be bad for them. I understand what you're saying now, I believe. I think they might do that, but do you really think that's *why* they exist?",Forward-Razzmatazz18,2022-10-08T12:01:52,1
"What does that even mean? Harry Truman was once as politically powerful as I am. Does that mean I'm certain to become the leader of the free world? Geez, with logic like that maybe you ARE a Green supporter.",mormagils,2022-08-24T23:04:53,3
"I would say that's a pretty decent oversimplification, yes.",mormagils,2022-10-05T14:37:25,1
"Not if there's no greater significance. It certainly *could*, and I would argue that it very much did in the case of the Tea Party, where local grassroots groups started running candidates in statewide or districtwide elections to challenge incumbents and won. In that case, the rumblings at the lowest level DID develop into a larger, significant movement that united into a set of consistent policies and was able to win elections.  ......But that hasn't happened with the Greens. Despite having a seeming foothold out West in hyper-local races, they have shown no ability to broaden beyond that into a consistent political movement. They cannot organize the local school board party members into anything larger and united that can wield actual political power across constituencies.   Winning local elections is a *necessary* condition to being considered a ""real"" party, but it is not a *sufficient* condition.",mormagils,2022-10-05T21:12:57,1

"Yeah given how basically every town in America will have atleast 5 or so school board members and there are around 19,500 incorporated communities in the US that’s a really low number, plus an environmentalist party can’t really do much on school boards that isn’t any different from a normal liberal or progressive candidate",HiggetyFlough,2022-08-26T10:29:30,2
