Yeah sorry I live in reality.  If you didnt vote cause you had sour grapes your guy wasnt the candidate and you couldnt bring yourself to support the DNC when project 2025 was completely available and Trump campaigned on the things he is currently doing you implicitly supported Trump.  I didnt particularly like Kamala or the democrats keeping the biden in until it was too late for a proper primary either.  But I read project 2025 and paid attention to trumps rhetoric and sucked it up because I believe that was objectively the better outcome.

The corporatists don't care what the identity of their wage slaves are.   The Biden administration was relentlessly pro-genocide; moreover, the fact that the party line in the 2020 election was that Trump was an existential threat and then the milquetoast response afterwards to punishing the previous administration for its crimes made the Democrats come off as disingenuous, like they wanted the electorate to be motivated so they got votes but didn't actually care themselves.",Song_of_Laughter,2025-05-10T15:52:07,1

"I don‚Äôt disagree. There‚Äôs a lot wrong with the current state of the Democratic party. Running on a platform of ‚ÄúAt least we‚Äôre not Trump‚Äù is terrible, but honestly, what other choice was there?   Progressives and other left-leaning individuals are entirely too fragmented and plagued by in-fighting that there was never going to be a platform that would engage the masses like the Populist lying of Trump.   There are only ever two options in American elections, and if we keep ‚Äúprotest‚Äù voting against the one party who we think would be swayed by such protests, and doing nothing of substance against the other party, then its clear who is going to end up winning.   Like where are we as a country where we only choose to act in any substantial way as a form of protest only against one party because we already know the other won‚Äôt budge? We just don‚Äôt vote for the party we have A CHANCE to sway towards populist/leftist policy? How is that in any way anything but a vote in the other direction?

"For better and for worse all left-wingers have is the Democrat party at the moment. Without a complete and total dismantling of the current MAGA movement will ensure there will never be a true left party in this country. There‚Äôs no other choice. You have the Republicans, the Russian disinfo Green party that only crawls out of the Kremlin once every election cycle to siphon votes away from the Democrats (which essentially gives those votes to the Republicans), or Republican-by-any-other-metric Libertarians.   There is no way away from this but with small, calculated steps. There‚Äôs no way this ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù attitude leftists have right now that‚Äôll generate any momentum or change.   I‚Äôm very excited by the momentum AOC, Crockett, Sanders, and a few others are finding right now.
