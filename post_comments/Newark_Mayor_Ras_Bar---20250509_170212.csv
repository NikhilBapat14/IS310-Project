"I ate a 3 day ban for even suggesting that people wouldn't stand for this kind of abuse, so all I want to say is that I hope people respond to this peacefully but with the proper anger.",SN1-Rxn,2025-05-09T17:11:57,9

"I don’t feel like being banned right now, so I’ll just say this: I hope people respond appropriately.  It’s wild how our officials can be arrested for disagreeing with Trump, and yet we can’t  even say what needs to be said around here.",EWAINS25,2025-05-09T17:15:59,13

He's being an adult and reflecting on what could have been done differently... but the voters who voted for this are ultimately responsible for the government they created.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-09T17:29:06,7
