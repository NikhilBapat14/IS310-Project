"Angus made some poor votes this term re letting Trump appointees be approved. But he is a good man, and is genuinely afraid for the future of our democracy. I listened to him on NPR for an hour 2 weeks ago? Talking to Mainers, and I was heartened. All that said, fuck nepotism, and the Maine Attorney General is also gonna run— and she has never backed down from Trump (she’s the one who took him off the ballot).    The bigger concern in Maine this next election is the 2nd congressional district which is represented by a traitorous maggot (Jared Golden d.) and he is going to face off against Gov Lapage (also a traitorous maggot- but with the r.). Golden needs to be primaried by a liberal that can win in rural Maine— and that might be tough",Ticksdonthavelymph,2025-05-06T07:03:45,3

Think she would be too concerned for their well-being if they enter something as stressful as politics.,IcehandGino,2025-05-06T05:53:58,2
God fucking dammit LeDouchbag will NOT go away.  He ran off to Florida and said he was never coming back and here he fucking is.  And don't call him Gov...he hasn't been for near a decade now and I refuse to call him as such now that he isn't.,ERedfieldh,2025-05-06T08:03:57,2
