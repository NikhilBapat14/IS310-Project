"Marina Hyde is a sketch journalist. She basically takes the piss out of politicians, and she is very good at it.  The venues for open are already picked for the next 3 years (Royal Portrush, Royal Birkdale, and St Andrews), and the 4th is almost certain to be at Royal Lytham",Duanedoberman,2025-04-29T12:35:41,2

Starmer.  Trump is acting in self-interest.  Starmer is just a simp.  he prolly won't even get anything out of this other than looking like a simp,Ask_DontTell,2025-04-29T12:14:43,7

The answer is Peter Thiel. He pressured UK government to losen regulations on investments in the UK and along the way picked up an NHS and a military contract for Palantir.  I think Starmer is just afraid to act against US government because he knows who are real rulers.,drmanhattanmar,2025-04-29T13:36:52,1
"actually i didn't have to go to any level.  Starmer might be a great PM for Brits but from a Canadian's perspective, he's a Neville Chamberlain who couldn't even say that Canada was a sovereign nation when asked about Trump's threats to annex us.  Given the Canadian lives sacrificed in two world wars fighting for Britain, having the British Prime Minister defend us with words didn't seem like a big ask.  So yeah, while i don't hate Starmer, i have ZERO respect for him.",Ask_DontTell,2025-04-29T16:15:25,0
