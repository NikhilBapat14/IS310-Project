One thing I find interesting is that main subreddits are awash with pro-Indian posts and articles from Indian sources during all this.Â    Hard to tell what actually is going on with all that propaganda and nationalism,EmployAltruistic647,2025-05-10T12:28:08,1

Yes because when there is a nuclear bomb dropped on your head borders will become obsolete. Nuclear bombs is why the world should never see 2 nations with nukes go to war.,No_Vacation8347,2025-05-10T10:16:29,1

"> he wants to copy israel and genocide Pakistanis  That's a nice argument senator, mind backing it up with a source?

Maybe stop harbouring terror!sts in Pak land and life will be better?,Agreeable_Pack_6456,2025-05-10T10:17:17,1
But Pakistan can actually defend itself and has nuclear weapons. Which is why a war between both is even more dangerous than Israel and Palestine.,zeynabhereee,2025-05-10T11:09:05,1
