Iâ€™m glad to see he is withholding aid from red states in addition to blue states. I was a bit worried after the red states voted for Trump and getting rid of federal disaster assistance they would only cut it to blue states.,Ready_Nature,2025-04-24T17:47:10,25
"Well, it's called fiscal conservatism, isn't this what Kentucky voted for? Kentucky should look on the bright side: abortion is illegal there. That's what they wanted. That's what they got.",RiseDelicious3556,2025-04-24T17:46:55,19

"Kentuckian here: we've been hit very consistently by terrible weather events over the last few years, something our (wonderful) governor has commented frequently on. Thankfully where I live hasn't been hugely impacted but areas of extreme flooding and tornados are all around me. It's horrible, but I have to agree that folks are getting what the majority of them voted for, and unfortunately they've still not realized it.Â    I don't want my neighbors to suffer, but it's hard not to be bitter about how they inflicted this on everyone here, and I'm just thankful that me and my family have all heretofore been spared (though my grandmother, who does not support Trump, came close to getting flooded).Â  Somehow we managed to vote in a Democratic governor who is great (hoping for a 2028 presidential run), but our Republican legislature barely lets him do anything.Â ",ZacPensol,2025-04-24T18:51:07,11
"Trump defunded FEMA and fired all the FEMA workers. Kentucky isn't getting shit.   This is the new reality, all of the states need to understand that the federal government is no longer going to help in times of need, and we as citizens are all on our own.",FreshRest4945,2025-04-24T18:14:35,8

In the article it says that FEMA approved disaster declarations for some counties but not others because they didnâ€™t consider the damage severe enough to qualify, even though itâ€™s clear that these counties were devastated by the floods.
