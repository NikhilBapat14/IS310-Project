"Her previous quote in the article is gold.  ""As long as I am your Governor, the meddling hand of big government creeping down from Washington DC will be stopped cold at the Mississippi River"" - Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Jan 16, 2023.  She's a woman of her word.",Aetylus,2025-04-22T14:22:56,7404
"Here's what's interesting about this to me:  There have been theories that Trump would kill FEMA and save the federal disaster relief funding only for the States who voted for him in 2024, and Republican Governors who've been actively trying to help forward his platform.  Now as covered by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fema-north-carolina-washington-recovery-funds-rcna201417), so far that's true for Washington, which [went 39.01% to Trump in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_Washington_(state)), and he's said he wants to withhold disaster relief funds from California, which [went 38.33% to Trump in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_California).   However, he's also withheld disaster relief funds from North Carolina, [which went 50.86% to Trump in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_North_Carolina), and now Arkansas, [which went 64.20% to Trump in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_Arkansas).   So this is the first sign I'm seeing that his disaster relief funding isn't being restricted by political allegiance, but perhaps withholding federal disaster relief altogether.",Terakian,2025-04-22T14:32:24,640

"“I didn’t know the austerity leopards would eat my face too!”  All this begging from Republicans who kissed Trump’s ring just demonstrates that they are just as gullible and short-sighted as their constituents are, thinking that if they appease the bully they’d get special treatment.   Nope, he hates everyone equally and if his denial of federal assistance hurts Republicans, so be it. He doesn’t need any of the local and state Republicans until midterms, and will praise his favorites in the meantime but for now, it’s all and will only be “What have you done for me lately?”  This is why you don’t prop up a selfish narcissist as the savior of your party. Even still, Trump would still gain support by doing this, but now that he’s in the driver’s seat and gets to be openly corrupt, it’s all about his personal enrichment (as evidenced by his foreign business dealings throughout his first term).   Trump literally has no incentive to ever do anything ever again unless it somehow benefits him personally, because while others may want him around for a third term, he already got what he wanted - power, a pipeline of foreign money, completely escaped all prosecution, and can play golf as much as he wants.

"I'm looking at this from a wider angle. If these storms and flooding are not severe enough for federal assistance. What will classify an emergency? This could happen in your city/state. These are examples we need to keep in mind. Hurricane season is coming.   ""But the Trump administration declined to declare a disaster, meaning no federal assistance would be heading our way.   In their rejection note to Sanders’ March 21 request, the federal government said the damage wasn’t anything state and local folks couldn’t handle.   Here’s what the federal government said in its denial, according to Lacey Kanipe, spokeswoman for the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management:   “Based on our review of all of the information available, it has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies. Accordingly, we have determined that supplemental federal assistance is not necessary.”   Sanders and the state Division of Emergency Management appealed that decision on April 18, after another round of spring storms worked Arkansas over. In their appeal, they described the compounding nature of the storms.   “The severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 14 and 15, 2025, produced catastrophic impacts across the state. The sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders’ appeal letter said. “Less than three weeks later, Arkansas was once again devastated by a second wave of severe storms, tornadoes, and a generational flooding event. These compounding disasters severely affected many of the same counties, adding even more catastrophic debris and tragically claiming the lives of three additional Arkansans. Given the cumulative impact of these events, federal assistance is essential to help our communities recover.”",ListeningPlease,2025-04-22T17:00:20,2

Huckabee’s a closet case who can’t deal with being a lesbian. Everyone who knows about Sarah from college knows all about her extracurricular activities with other - often much younger - females.

"We were driving across the country and there was a rockfall that closed the freeway in Arkansas and we had to take a detour through the creepiest little town I have ever been through.  We didn't stop until we got out of the area at a little gas station.  There was a big burly trucker there and we asked him if he had also driven through the town.  ""Yup.  Damn creepy."" So, I felt less silly for being creeped out if he was, too. I'm not even sure why it was creepy.  There were just all these houses and buildings right up next to the road with lights on but no people anywhere.  I can't really explain it. Just felt like we shouldn't stop.",crazyisthenewnormal,2025-04-23T21:34:08,3

"I see what you are saying, and poverty can be a factor in some crimes of desperation. But, there are plenty of crimes committed by people who aren't in poverty, such as all the examples of white collar crime: Martin Shkreli, Bernie Madoff, and Martha Stewart are the first ones who come to mind   FWIW, I have lived in HUD housing and I work in a high poverty school, and I see a lot of folks living in poverty but they aren't committing crimes. People living in poverty know that their hard life is going to get exponentially more difficult if they are busted even doing the pettiest of crimes, such as shoplifting. Also, there are plenty of impoverished people who have more morals than money, so they don't need legal punishment to be the deterrent, their religious faith is enough for a lot of folks. There are people who live in poverty and they see this life as their earthly suffering because, ""Those who are least on earth shall be first in Heaven"".  I don't know what the statistics are for crime rates in high poverty areas, and I assume that they are certainly higher than affluent areas. But, I think it oversimplifies the issue to say that poverty is the root of crime. It is certainly not true of all crimes and it kind of implies that people living in poverty are more likely to commit crimes than affluent people, but we see multiple examples of affluent people committing horrible crimes of financial devastation of their victims, physical / sexual assault, trafficking, murder, etc.   I do believe that the love of money (greed) is the root of evil, but I reject the notion that poverty, in and of itself, is the root of crime. It is more nuanced than that. However, it is clear that we both agree that poverty must be addressed because it would solve a number of societal issues, including some types of crimes. My apologies if this was TLDR, but cheers if you made it this far. I think we both certainly agree that people living in poverty need understanding, compassion, and support.",Single-Moment-4052,2025-04-23T05:24:01,2
