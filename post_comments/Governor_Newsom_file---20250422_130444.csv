The courts are the only way this ends.   Trump is too much of a moron to back down and Congress is too chicken shit to cross Trump.   One man shouldn't have the power to wave around the purse strings of the entire government over some bullshit made up emergency.,freethrowtommy,2025-04-22T13:42:44,15
I still don’t understand why the Dems chose Harris instead.,lelekeaap,2025-04-22T13:46:03,-20
Newsome is way worse. He’s MAGA-curious. And wasn’t VP.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-22T14:18:43,23
"Because she was the vice-president. That's pretty obvious.  Also, Newsome is fucking awful.",Ertai2000,2025-04-22T13:56:08,26
"There is speculation that the main reason Kamala Harris was picked is because she was already on the ticket. By FEC law, you can’t just hand campaign funds over to a new candidate unless they were officially part of the original campaign.  Since Harris was already listed on the Biden-Harris team, she could legally take over the campaign and access the $90 million that had been raised. If she had decided not to run, that money couldn’t be used by anyone else. It would’ve had to be sent back to donors, given to political groups or charities, or used to pay off campaign expenses.   Losing $90 million that late in the game would have been a huge hit to the party. They worked with what they had.",Fuckit445,2025-04-22T20:24:51,6
"I wasn’t too enthusiastic when Kamala became the front runner, but Gavin would have been a much worse choice.   He pretty much represents California politics as a whole and people across the country absolutely hate that. When I moved some of my backwoods family at home in PA acted like I was heading for a war zone.",BreadForTofuCheese,2025-04-22T18:40:38,5
"They didn’t, Biden did with his decision to endorse her at the same moment he dropped out.",AJDx14,2025-04-22T14:47:12,5
"Newsome honestly couldn't win on the national stage. He's too much of a California pretty boy in the eyes of the voters in the Rust Belt. The white working class voters in Michigan and Pensilvania are going to take one look at him, call him a homo as an insult and never listen to a thing he says. The New Yokers are going to see a vain Hollywood lawyer and honestly, most people in California don't like him because he's either too left or too right, depending on who you ask.   Honestly no matter who the Democrats ran they would have lost. The simple fact is that apathy has strangled American democracy so badly that no one is going to get the vast majority of people to take time out of their day to vote.",DisMFer,2025-04-22T16:06:19,1
"Oh, you'll never get a solid reason. They're just as bad at taking accountability as Republicans. Both parties are corrupt capitalists who will protect capitalism before doing a damn thing for the working class that isn't performative.",Nateandgypsy,2025-04-22T19:56:42,0
SHE raised $1 billion. A better candidate could have raised more. The $90 million was useless.,jonthecpa,2025-04-22T22:59:50,-2
"Yes, she raised over $1 billion over the *course* of her campaign—but coming in so late, she needed a solid foundation to hit the ground running. Hence securing the remaining $90 million from Biden’s funds. Far from useless—it was essential in giving her the momentum to launch a viable campaign from day one.",Fuckit445,2025-04-23T03:18:53,2
