"A recession hasn’t been confirmed yet, just one quarter of negative growth.   Already downplaying a recession indicates not only is it certain, but is likely to be deep and brutal.",Gadshill,2025-05-03T03:14:40,30
You should see the conservative forums and websites already pre-programming MAGA voters to think a recession will be beneficial.,InsideAside885,2025-05-03T03:24:37,19
"Everything’s OK’ is one hell of a thing to say while the economy’s literally slowing down and prices are climbing. That’s not a transition, that’s a warning sign.",Kitchen_Bicycle4339,2025-05-03T03:14:55,11
"Transitioning from a growing economy, to a recession, then to a depression, and finally the collapse of the capitalist experiment.",Sir_Earl_Jeffries,2025-05-03T05:43:44,10
"What we need now is a big ass expensive military parade on Trump's birthday.  Yes, we need American military power in full blatant display. Right here on US soil in front of the American public and a reminder of who is in control of it.  Not at all for intimidation purposes or to crush everyone's spirits further into the ground though.  Yep, a recession and a military birthday parade. I wonder what kind of 'transition' Trump is really talking about.",Jasonicca,2025-05-03T04:33:19,9

It’s time for 60 minutes to go to court and resolve this issue.,Khorondon01,2025-05-03T09:11:47,3
"Reuters knows the recession will be ""short term"" how?   Or are they just taking Trump's word as fact?   And considering that Trump is a congenital liar, taking his word as fact means you WANT to believe in him.   Furthermore, nothing in the article says the recession will be short-term.    Which means Reuters deliberately chose that wording, without any facts to justify it.   And that's pure propaganda... which Reuters voluntarily wrote and published.",Joadzilla,2025-05-03T05:28:25,5

"Quote from https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/business/trump-recession-nbc-meet-the-press: „President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss growing concerns that his economic policies could cause a recession, telling NBC News that the economy would be “OK” in the long term even if a recession happens in the near future.“",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-03T03:13:23,2

"What recession? The stock market is growing, business is booming, the illegals are being sent prison where they belong, fentanyl is gone, Church is back in schools where it belongs, and I'm thinking about becoming the next Pope!",TopEagle4012,2025-05-03T03:17:13,5
"He can keep saying this stuff, and I know many people on here have a pretty ""MAGA will do what they are told"", but my perspective is let him say whatever he wants.  America is a business first and foremost, the tide changes in this country based on how much money people are making.  This has does not work for the left and has always worked to advantage of the right, but the more lies he tells, the more he loses credibility.  People want to be rich and racist, they will tolerate losing some money and still being racist, they will not tolerate being hungry and racist.  At this point he is ruining the republican brand not just his.     I do pretty well for myself and I have been feeling the pinch, I can only imagine how the median US household feels at 65k (or whatever it is now).  We are just starting, the next couple of weeks are going to continue to bring up temperatures, the next couple of months are going to be wild.  Rand Paul knows it is coming.  When someone walks into Walmart and it is sparsely stocked, and the food prices are incredibly high, there is no amount of fox news that is going to save them.  Fox news is also already switching to blaming trump but not the conservative brand.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-05-03T05:36:21,3
So when exactly is this <air quotes> transition period <end air quotes> supposed to end?  Voters are very impatient and unforgiving.,Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-03T17:54:00,1

I would head over and ask how angry they would be if all this had happened under Biden but I honestly don't need them responding to me.,Crazy-Nights,2025-05-03T03:55:47,12
On point for them . Didn't some Republicans want old people to take one for the team during covid so that we could get back to work?,aijoe,2025-05-03T20:53:05,3
