"The average American pays 20% in income tax at the federal level. So lets say you make $100k a year for easy math. You get taxed at 20%, so you take home 80K a year after taxes. Then you have rent or a mortgage. Let's say rent at the national average of $1755 for a single bedroom. You now have 58,940 per year. Food on average is about $572 per month, plus phone, utilities, transportation, clothing. The average person spends about $4700 on all expenses each month (including that rent from before. Now you are left with $3,216.67 per month. That is also assuming average medical costs, but removing outliers leads you to spending far less than the over $300 average, but we will keep it. (numbers based on [this article](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-monthly-expenses-for-one-person/), except for rent which comes from [this one](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/))  Now, we will only change the taxes and tariffs. Obviously, potential increased drilling and such would likely drive down transportation and electricity costs, but we can't know for sure what the percent change would be so let's only deal with known values.  If your income tax is cut to 0% (since 100k is less than the 150-200k cutoff), your take home is now the full $100k amount. Let's take out your same rent, utilities, phone, and health care costs, leaving off clothing and food for now. That comes out to $3,040 per month in expenses that are unlikely to increase much if at all from tariffs due to primarily being either services or domestically produced. Food and clothing will go up in many cases. 98% of clothes are imported so let's just call that 100% because, realistically, the likelihood of you finding all American options for all apparel items is nil at those percentages. Average tariffs right now are 14.5% on apparel. The mixture of increases will go from about 40% to 65% depending on the country, with china being at 65%. We will use 60% since not all of the clothes come from china, but to also give the least conservative estimate we can without being ridiculous and claiming 100% comes from china. That $123 from clothes now becomes $196.80. So about a $63/month increase. Your expenses are now $3103.80 per month. Still lower. Let's look at food.  Imported food makes up right around 17% of the US diet. I'm having a really hard time finding percentages for the current tariffs on food imports and what they will change to but according to experts, it should be about a [2.8% overall increase on food products](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/business/grocery-prices-tariffs/index.html&ved=2ahUKEwjVqoyRifuMAxUa6skDHaV1OCwQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1WHcXyY2EIBz0UdaT4n734), I'm assuming this is pre-adjusted for the increase only being on 17% of the foods we eat. Assuming this, the $572/month food cost becomes $588.02/month. Adding this in, you have a monthly cost of $3,691.82. The amount you keep per month has now increased from $3,216.67, to $4,641.52.  Meaning you have nearly flipped your costs and your take home for the better.  Obviously, if you make less than $100k, this still works in your favor. The average income is right around 65-69(nice)K per year. Using 67.5, you get a take home of 1908.18, which is an increase of $1008/month (this is assuming all of your expenses are identical to the above breakdown).  This also assumes no US production increases, no changing of your habits to reduce or increase spending (because most people being told they will keep $1000 more per month don't make the smart decision to save or pay off debts with it).   So overall, while tariffs do increase prices, keeping more of your income, which does not 100% go to paying for things, benefits you more than having it taxed to begin with.",deelectrified,2025-04-28T10:57:01,1
"Reduced income tax on the lower class, does not actually help them if tariffs are in place to ""replace"" it.  For one, the tariffs are a regressive taxation scheme that charges consumers per purchase rather than just out of their paycheck as one flat sum determined by their income level. So if you consume more, you pay more. And if you are poorer, the flat cost of the tariffs is more of a percentage of your income than any income tax bracket is.  Secondly, income and payroll taxes help pay for social security. If you destroy the income source, you destroy Social Security. Removing income taxes from employees and employers, is a backdoor to gutting benefits Americans have earned.  Income Tax is by it's nature, the best tax plan for the poor and middle class. Because a progressive tax scheme using income tax, allows the government to tax the poor less than it taxes the wealthy. Tariffs are a consumption tax, which is inherently a regressive tax scheme.
