"This was expected, and honestly - buh bye.  The dude caved and voted for the GOP agenda. We don't need feckless reps who enable the current administration's policies. They need to be there and fight.",Parking-Emphasis590,2025-04-23T13:01:18,11

"This is a good article when he was contemplating running again.   One comment Durbin made was: >Durbin, 80, acknowledged last week it’s a difficult decision for an eight-year commitment that includes two years of campaigning and six years on the job. And a person close to the senator told Playbook that only two people know which way Durbin will decide: “The senator and his wife, Loretta.”  It's not just his current age, it's the campaigning and serving.  Only if Senator Grassley who is 91 had the same logic and instead woul just hang out with his great, great grandkids, eating ice cream and watching the corn grow.  He seems to like to post updates on corn growth so he'll still be a part of the farming community that way.   The Late Senator Dianne Feinstein of CA was born the same year - fact her passing away and them working together as collegues for so long on the Judiciary Senate committee shows how stubborn he is, in addition to Iowa voting him back in.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-04-23T13:13:25,2

Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi as well.  Should be an interesting primary,ParsnipForward149,2025-04-23T14:23:52,2
"I mean, there's a lot to be concerned about sure. But Durbin not running for re-election ain't it. He's 80 and has been a Senator since the 90s. Nothing wrong or unusual about this move.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-04-23T13:04:48,5
"Okay, but we complain about the old fucks and wanting them to retire...and then one does the right thing and this is the response lol",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-04-23T13:00:53,5
The man is 80. He should have retired a decade ago.,smersh101,2025-04-23T13:10:02,2
"It's probably a safe seat considering it's IL. Hopefully, we get some quality candidates running on the Dem/lib/progressive side.",oldguydrinkingbeer,2025-04-23T13:15:32,2
Illinois can do better than Dick Durbin. Happy to see him go.,ParsnipForward149,2025-04-23T13:42:36,1
