"I know it's satire but remember when Ilhan Omar and others wouldn't shut up about packing the supreme court, and r/pol clapped like seals?  I guarantee you we'd never hear the end of it if Trump attempted the same thing.",FapFapkins,2025-04-21T22:40:06,51

"Same with the fillibuster. They all hated the filibuster when it was the only thing forcing them closer to center when they had their trifecta, but suddenly Cory Booker (who wasn't even actually filibustering - there was no bill that he was trying to stop, he was just talking for the sake of talking) is a hero.

"No you don't understand, he needed to ""do something"" because his constituents asked him to.  Couldn't be that they want actual legislation, no Cory, they wanted to hear you ramble for 24 hours so you could be on the front page of Reddit for a couple days.",FapFapkins,2025-04-22T09:12:18,4
