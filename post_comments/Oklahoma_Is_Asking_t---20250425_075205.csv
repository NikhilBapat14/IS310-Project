"You can't have it both ways: either you complain that the textualists/constructionists aren't going living document enough, or you complain that the living document people aren't textual enough.  Cheering when they overturn themselves in favor of things you approve of and jeering when they do the opposite is no way to run a stable government.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T08:38:54,-4
The FRFF extremists pushed too hard - when they tried to block preschools from getting shredded tires for a playground so the kids wouldn't break bones on the grounds that safety for toddlers was endorsement of religion they awoke a lot of crusaders who then started looking for their own boundaries to push.,TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T08:41:50,-1
">You can't have it both ways: either you complain that the textualists/constructionists aren't going living document enough, or you complain that the living document people aren't textual enough.  This only makes sense if you pretend all SC decisions have the same scope and moral standing. Also you have to pretend this SC hasn't throw precedent in the wood chipper.  >Cheering when they overturn themselves in favor of things you approve of and jeering when they do the opposite is no way to run a stable government.  Right, which is exactly what Trump is doing. Are you under the impression that gentlemantroglodyte is running the government?",PinchesTheCrab,2025-04-25T09:04:38,4

"Clear violation of the 1st Amendment. The Supreme Court said so. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, 582 US _ (2017). 7-2 ruling found that excluding a preschool from a public program BECAUSE of their religious affiliation was discrimination. Only Sotomayor (obviously) and  Ginsburg dissented.   Your position would hold that a public fire department couldn't put out a burning church, or that the city's paramedics couldn't respond to a heart attack and the police couldn't arrest a white supremacist for burning down a black church.  They have, but in this case you aren't aware of what the court has actually said.  > We need to replace that with a firewall of such intensity that brushing against it costs you everything you have.  The people who wrote the 1st Amendment would disagree.  > Private religious schools should not only not receive public funds--they should be outright illegal.  There isn't a court in the country that would side with you on this. Do you support what the courts have said or not?",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T10:57:30,-1

"> Not a violation of the first amendment.  Supreme Court says otherwise. What's your counter?  > No it wouldn't, because a burning building is a threat to the entire public.  Not if it is 1,000 feet away from any other structure or flammable vegetation. And besides, they can simply contain the flames at the property line to prevent it from spreading so your argument fails on that point as well.  >> The people who wrote the 1st Amendment would disagree.  > No they wouldn't.  Can you back up this claim? And if you cite Jefferson's wall of separation you had better know where it came from, the context, and his views on religious freedom in general.  I'd bet money that you cite the wall of separation as ""proof"" of the absolute separation between state and church, but happily cheer Reynold v United States, even as you insist that the Reynolds finding that religious belief is not a valid defense for violating federal drug laws. Tell me I'm wrong.  > There is no first amendment right to public funds  There is no right to ANY public funds. It is also explicitly prohibited to discriminate on the grounds of religion.  > no first amendment right to have tax exempt status while using those funds for political speech  You have an argument there, but strict reading of the Constitution and supreme court rulings take you back to ""you could do this but for"" which constitutes illegal discrimination. And I invite you to tell all of the traditional black churches that openly supported Obama that they should all lose their tax exempt status.  > That's what the courts have said.  Citation needed. SCOTUS only, please.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T11:25:53,1
