Anything under an 8 point loss would be great in these races. Obviously they wonâ€™t win but just chopping that lead down so much would be impressive.Â ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-01T14:58:54,5
"They both lost by about 11 points.   We also see this problem with the 10 competitive states in 2008 that are now 10-30% guaranteed Republican wins. Even in a wave year, even with energized D's, the margins are just too big to overcome without a massive structural party change.",TheStarterScreenplay,2025-04-01T19:44:26,2
