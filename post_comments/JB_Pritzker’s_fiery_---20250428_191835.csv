"Pritzker will have an uphill battle as a multibillionaire. The whole reason we’re in this mess is because of the radical over abundance of money in politics. If Trump doesn’t manage to burn this democracy to the ground before he’s gone, there will need to be serious changes to the law in regards to money in politics, and the ability of elected officials to invest in the stock market. Clearly defined rules about the separation of powers, and removing presidential immunity. No one is above the law. Not even the POTUS.",Jamizon1,2025-04-28T20:32:17,53

"NAH BRO REALLY?!  Jokes aside, I do think he's, at the moment, the most likely to be nominated (although that's a weak position at the moment, with how open the contest is), and while I don't like him that much (then again, my eclectic ass is hardly able to like many Dems), I do think he's at the absolute least in the top quartile and would back him should he be the nominee.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-28T19:23:58,1

"The thing I personally like about pritzker is him knowing god damn well how much of a problem that is, and  his willingness to take full advantage of it in order to ratfuck the other side.  He bankrolled a whackjob GOP candidate here in an Illinois primary in order to make the election far easier for the dem - he agrees its fucked, but those are the rules the other side plays by.  He ran because the state was being *horribly managed* by a republican billionaire, and he knew that he was the best shot of getting rid of the guy.  IMO, he's been a fucking amazing governor.",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-28T21:36:09,54

"Thats exactly the wrong spirit. If Trump has taught us anything it's that negatives can be turned into positives if you have enough chutzpah.  If Pritzker is a billionaire running on taxing the rich, that's a strong message.",bin10pac,2025-04-28T19:39:24,31
"Yeah...I mean, I think that's the main reason I don't like him. He even physically reminds me of, like, a Texas oil billionaire. The guys right now who seem to be trying to position themselves for 2028 are just giving me very ""meh"" feelings right now.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-28T19:36:56,-2

"That’s a really interesting take, and I don’t hate it. He’s is definitely not a bad guy, but his class status makes him problematic. However, it’s his class status that got him there and has allowed him to fight for the good guys in a way that is actually effective. I’m afraid to get my hopes up, but I might anyway.",Airport_Wendys,2025-04-29T04:01:06,1
No way in hell I vote for a billionaire. My vote won’t matter because Dems will get so dumpstered if they run one that republicans will probably have enough votes to pass legislation the old fashioned way.,True-Surprise1222,2025-04-29T01:40:02,-4

"Seeing those comments in this thread is mind boggling. At this point in history, dem voters need to really just use the GOP playbook and fall in line and vote out Republicans. In an ideal world, we can aim for the perfect candidate but with how Dems  vote, everyone’s version of perfect is different and we will lose over and over and over again to Republicans.    It’s mind blowing that Dems are still playing this “we can’t run this person because…” game even as Trump is actively destroying the US as we used to know it.",1one1000two1thousand,2025-04-29T06:54:58,1

"Sure sure.. but that immoral person would have been a few generations back in his family.  Dude has spent a shit-ton of money helping people.  Most of the money he's made on his own has been through VC funding for startups, so pretty low on the ""immoral"" side of things.  The saying is ""nobody ever *makes* a billion dollars"" - and he didn't, he inherited it.  He then went and advocated for a estate tax, and pushed here in Illinois for a progressive tax that would see *his taxes* increased (spending millions of his own money on ads for it)  Believe what you want, but judge the guy based on the quality of his character and his actions - by every single measure, he appears to be a good guy.",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-28T21:44:54,10
