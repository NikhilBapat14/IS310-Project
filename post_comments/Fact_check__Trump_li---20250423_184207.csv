He told his cult the economy was collapsing when it was doing well. It shouldn’t be any problem to tell the cult it’s doing well when it’s collapsing. So long as their boss’s boss’s boss gets a tax cut they’ll happily starve. ,clickmagnet,2025-04-23T21:44:09,2

"I think your comment highlights the real problem. A private lawsuit is really our only ""check"" for disinformation campaigns, and private lawsuits require damages to be proven, are expensive as fuck, take forever to bring to conclusion and rarely have meaningful consequences especially in this national context. Fox news paid out almost a billion to settle with smartmatic and barely missed a step. Alex Jones got hit with almost billion dollar judgment in 2022 and is still actively spewing horse shit to the masses. . . The success of our entire system of governance is anchored on an assumption of a well educated electorate, not having a real check on the power to purposely miss lead the masses is a fundamental flaw.",duke_chute,2025-04-24T05:45:59,1
