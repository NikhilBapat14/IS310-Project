"This title is misleading. He certainly attributed a good portion of it to “sexism” but he called it a concerted effort against her character using sexism as one of the tools of attack. A big difference between saying she lost strictly due to her gender.

"I blame the policy of “Trump Bad, Harris not Trump” campaign for Harris’ loss. I don’t think I saw a single commercial where that wasn’t the message in the last month prior to the election. I know that’s personal bias but I live in a swing state and I can tell you what Trump campaigned on and couldn’t begin to describe Harris’ campaign policy outside of the default democratic policies.   It’s also why, I suspect that the Republicans won’t lose seats in the midterms. The democrats, rather than accepting why they lost, chose to blame things like sexism, rather than policy decisions and inaction when they had control.

"Regarding Biden's mental acuity, I have no doubt he was perfectly sharp behind the scenes when he had time to digest information and work through it with his staff. But the presidency is a performative position. What he was unable to do was to project strength and competence to voters on the spot in public. As to Harris, there were a lot of factors that contributed to her loss. Sexism was definitely one, but there were others as well.

"Sexism and racism undoubtedly played a part, but it is reductionist to simply blame the campaign failure on people’s reaction to ovaries and ignore every other error. There was so many other flaws with her campaign that many people who traditionally voted Democrat either didn’t vote or voted for Trump. The democrats really need to review all the reasons she wasn’t well-liked and not just forgive their failure because sexism offers a convenient reason without looking deeper. Her unclear or wishy-washy responses in interviews, her career history, her avoidance of controversial topics, and a bunch of other factors all piled on to make a lot of people uncomfortable with her representing the democrats when even a decade ago people would have associated her position and platform with the Republicans.",Infernari,2025-05-08T19:12:38,-1

The rift between fascist and liberal is lesser than between liberal and anarchist.

"> BIPOC  The ""BI"" in this acronym stands for black and indigenous, which are two groups I didn't mention. So great, you're technically correct there. I'm not disputing that her margins among Native and African American voters saw negligible movement.  And wonderful, you've provided the same links as me. We're about to start arguing in circles. Just because when you aggregate up to entire races as a whole Harris still won them (narrowly in the case of Hispanics, which were D+5) doesn't mean that under the hood there weren't sharp swings to the right, and that there wasn't a ""large share"" of different people from different cultures who didn't vote for the female candidate this year (per the initial poster's comments).   Just because that share is <50% when you cut it certain ways doesn't not make it large. It should be a 5 alarm fire for Dems that Hispanic men went comfortably Republican, Asian men possibly went maj-GOP (or came pretty close to 50/50), Hispanic women bolted rightward, and that [the Obama coalition as a whole appears to be dissipating in slow motion](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeJD27PXkAA1SjE?format=png&name=900x900). Now personally I'd disagree that it was primarily cultural given these groups strongly backed Hillary 8 years ago and is instead partially due to education polarization, but that's a whole separate subject.  > Slight shifts to the right  Latino men went from D+23 in 2020 to R+10 this year. Latina women went from D+39 to D+19. The majority-Asian precincts in that last link of mine swung between 17.6 (Dallas) and 31.3 (NYC) points rightward on average.

"> a main indicator of campaign success for both major parties.  I hate to say that that's probably just cope to a large extent. It's an indicator to *some* degree re. if the campaign is a legit contender or not - if it has the proverbial ""juice"" - but shouldn't be used as a binary ""Candidate A has way more small dollar donors than Candidate B, ergo they're running a stronger race"" metric - as a lot of downballot races in 2018/2020/2022 have reflected.   With the ongoing polarization on education in US politics, Dems have picked up the bloc of voters who are more likely to be politically engaged - whether that means responding to a poll, showing up to a protest action, knocking a door, phonebanking, voting in off-cycle/non-presidential elections, or donating money. Trump on the other hand has made gains in the larger bloc of people who are less engaged and less likely to do more than vote every 4 years, but still have that baseline level of involvement.  Harris crushing Trump in small-dollar donor stats is a sign she was much stronger among the people more likely to give $10 or whatnot to a campaign - who are also in general more likely to vote than those who aren't willing to give money, but not to the extent that they're the ballgame.
