Is there a number of times someone can self-deport? Can they simply walk across multiple times and received 1000 each time? Why aren't we allowed to do this? /s,Sad-Conclusion8276,2025-05-05T13:29:35,5
Just imagine how Republicans would react if a Democratic President did this.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-05T12:44:50,9
Who would believe that the government is actually going to pay up?,AllynCrane,2025-05-05T12:49:37,7
Who‚Äôs to verify if the said persons actually deport. Can random people now claim to have deported and get $1000. I‚Äôm sure this will go well.,shindekokoro,2025-05-05T14:29:03,3

For those smart enough to know this is not going to happen... I recommend watching this. [https://youtu.be/S\_naItk8Egc?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/S_naItk8Egc?feature=shared),williamgman,2025-05-05T14:00:49,2
"I agree that Trump's admin would try to cheat these people out of the money, but is $1000 even enough to convince someone to go through the hassle of leaving the country back to a place they didn't want to live in in the first place?  It's maybe not the typical case, but an immigrant worker in my area doing roofing for $10 a square is making pretty good money. Not sure a one-time, uncertain $1000 would sway them.",jaxonfairfield,2025-05-05T14:05:03,2
I'm sure if we pass the collection jar we could get $100k by the end of the week for Trump to deport.  Here's a hundred to get you started.,rapidcreek409,2025-05-05T12:49:39,2
How are they going to know? Also undocumented immigrants a vpn is less than 1k. Set your location to Mexico boom free money.,Individual_Respect90,2025-05-05T13:16:57,1

"I don't think they thought this one over. Think of all the drug traffikers that will assume a name, travel over the boarder with their drugs and then apply to the US Govt. for $1000 and a ""very nice plane ride home"".

"You don't get the money until you ""verify"" via the app that you've returned to your home country.   Since the app was rewritten hastily from the Biden immigration app, probably vibe coded by the Doge middle schoolers, my guess is it just checks your GPS.  So, if you live somewhere in Central America, have people start the process, then mail you their phones, you complete the verification and mail it back.  Charge 15% of the $1000.  Profit.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-06T08:33:11,1
well...they fired the guy that actually writes government checks so it might be a bit longer. Who is even going to process all these millions of requests?,TheRealJenneJ,2025-05-06T04:26:12,1
