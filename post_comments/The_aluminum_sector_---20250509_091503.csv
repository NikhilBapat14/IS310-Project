"No industrial policy.  That's it.  He did the tariffs without industrial policy, so they have no reason to bring the manufacturing back.  They're just going to pass along the costs.",JadedIT_Tech,2025-05-09T09:18:05,17

"Drilling miles-deep holes in the ground for oil to burn will never be cheaper than free energy from rainfall that Canadians, Norwegians, and others have access to in droves.",StarbeamII,2025-05-09T09:40:20,12
[the US is the leader in oil production and has been for the last six years](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production) is another reason why drilling for oil wont help the energy issue.,ray_area,2025-05-09T13:54:35,3
"Yep, abundant ""Hydroelectric Power"" in Canada makes it possible to not only produce high grade aluminum cheaply and cleanly. Moreover, even if the US increased production to try and lower costs why would they do it for much less than the increased imposed tariff prices? Building manufacturing plants is not cheap and they would want to recoup that cost. It just doesn't make any logical sense when it's cheaper and more environmentally friendly elsewhere. But hey... try to explain that to an old demented fart.",Thund3rbolt,2025-05-09T10:04:49,7
