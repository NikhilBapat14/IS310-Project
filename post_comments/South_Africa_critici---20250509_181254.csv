"Keep in mind that this ""plan"" is coming from the guy who has repeatedly refused to welcome refugees who have been *actually* suffering under violent, dictatorial regimes, who have been *actually* facing discrimination, civil war, persecution and threats of violence.  Yea, this is coming from the guy who has been pursuing his own radical, expansionist agenda; threatening to annex Canada; colonize Greenland; seize international trade routes; displace millions of Gazans so he can build a beachfront resort and hotel district on their land...  Not to mention his provocations in Yemen, his escalating tensions with China, and his ""beautiful deal"" with Putin to help readmit Russia into the international club and hand over nearly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory to Russia, and without providing any specific security guarantees in return.  At the same time, Trump is straining our relationships with allies and inflaming diplomatic and economic hostilities the world over.  He has so many disparaging things to say about some of our closest allies, all while continuing to go to bat for our enemies. America first my ass.  Now, as far South Africa goes, we all know he's carrying water for Musk here while perpetuating some white grievance fueled, ""reverse discrimination"" narrative that resonates with his nativist and white nationalist base at home.  Of course there's no mention from Trump of the previous apartheid regime, which segregated, scapegoated and discriminated against all racial groups that weren't part of the White minority. A system designed for the purpose of maintaining this White minority rule and its economic and political dominance over all non-white South Africans.  Even though apartheid ended in 1994, its impact still continues to be felt today in the region. So not only is Trump falsely maintaining that white people are being unfairly persecuted, but he's ignorant of the reality that the opposite is still far more realistic.  Black South Africans still suffer from economic inequality, many of their communities still remain segregated, and they still have poor access to employment and education opportunities.  The narrative that Trump is pushing is supported predominantly by white nationalist groups, it's largely exaggerated and dishonest.  There is not some targeted campaign against white farmers, and while there have been some sensationalized reports of violence against farmers, these incidents are the result of broader crime issues, not anti-white racism.  South Africa's land reform policies are merely addressing some of these historic inequities and injustices that are still lingering as a result of apartheid.  These efforts are attempting to redistribute land more equitably, but ""White land"" isn't being selectively expropriated. In fact, the laws in place are seeking out land that is unused or underutilized, while productive farms are being left alone. These laws are not exclusively targeting ""white farmland,"" nor do they intend to dispossess white South Africans of their land or property.  Trump's actions and rhetoric ignore the broader context and nuances here. This whole narrative about ""white genocide"" and ""reverse discrimination"" is merely a misrepresentation of facts meant to fuel white nationalist grievances and resentment.  It's not about taking land or anything away from white people, it's about addressing past injustices, it's about equality. The problem is that these white nationalist groups tend to confuse equality with oppression.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-09T18:49:30,6
