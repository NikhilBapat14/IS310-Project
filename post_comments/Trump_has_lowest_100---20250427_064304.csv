"I love how Trump could have probably rode into the white house 2.0 and acted just as the typical, standard Republican. No pointless across the board tariffs, no drastic cuts things like Veteran's Care, NIH science funding, and USDA farmer aid which even GOP voters are complaining about, no wrongful deportations/deporting US citizens, just following due process to carry out the law, no chaos in markets and shattering consumer confidence, price hikes looming etc.  And then instead, he could just do more tax cuts (slanted towards the wealthy), more spending on the military, and he could have said something like ""We're going to build up the manufacturing in these three critical areas..."" The economy would have hummed along at like +2.5%+3%, continued record employment, profits, stocks, etc. And despite structural issues with our economy (e.g. inequality, costs of housing, healthcare, education etc), he could have just sat back and declared it the best economy ever...a lie, but he'd probably be at 51-53% approval, which is decent in modern times, and he could have rode off into the sunset.

He could’ve coasted on Biden’s economy. But his narcissism wouldn’t allow that. The idea that the economy would’ve chugged along successfully without him bothers him.

IF it were a government by the people and for the people, I'd be reasonable in expecting a dismal approval rating would be reason to adjust course.  The reality is, it is unlikely the US is governed by the people, and for the people, and is rather governed by the wealthy and privileged to benefit the wealthy and privileged.",GeneralPITA,2025-04-27T07:53:28,4
"These are nice and all, but conservatives do not live in a reality where Trump is doing anything wrong. Most people I know are conservatives. A good majority of them are over six figure earners who finished college. But everyone they know and every source they choose to watch/read praises Trump while spinning any negatives against him and saying he's doing the best he can to repair failed liberal agendas.    I have a few conservative friends who outright give me that weird Tucker face because I'll bring up a story featured on NPR or similar outlets and they'll think it's made up because they were reading conservative sites and watching Fox News and it wasn't mentioned. They live in an alternate reality when it comes to Trump.    But it's not surprising. I've talked to successful people, money-wise, who will still think J6 was an inside job to try to make Trump look bad. They think all his criminal cases were Biden's DOJ going after his political rival, and that Fauci should be in jail for creating COVID hysteria and profiting from it, etc.",Due-Egg4743,2025-04-27T10:49:59,5

I mean his first term he was somewhat being restrained by his own administration both in terms of incompetence/unpreparedness and being dependent on a mostly sane RNC approving his appointments and/or policies.  Now MAGA’s pretty much gotten all RNC legislators either on their side or so scared of being primaried by Musk funded politicians/getting retaliated against they aren’t challenging him on much of anything even when their constituents are being affected.   Even then he’s blatantly snubbing them and ruling by EO instead of doing the simpler thing of getting laws passed which makes it feel like he is directly responsible more than the legislators.

And that also caused Trump to raise because people are tired of both sides of the establishment, specifically the Clinton and Bush family.   Hillary got a lot of things going on her end as well, and back then the polls was:  Hillary can defeat Bernie in the democrat primary, but in national election will lose.

She would have been fine many presidents have said wild things and or weird things but reality it is not that scary. Trump literally is doing his wild claims.harris was very well spoken too and had her own views that she discussed once she was running.

"This screams of not being familiar with how organizations of any sort work. Hillary was an influential and 30-year part of the DNC/DCCC.

I have had many allies, direct reports, and others that were influential to my career. When I could and for damned good reason, I aided them inside and outside that organization. I would often lift them up the same way they lifted me up. It's called teamwork and it's how group dynamics work.

Both   > In reflection of Bernie to Trump votes which was also not an insignificant number  Among three polls, those were estimated at less than 12%, and only 6% in another poll, about the same as Rubio->Clinton voters and far less than Kasich->Clinton voters. More than that, 24% of people who voted for Clinton in 2008 in the primaries voted for McCain in the general election, so 2 to 4x more than Bernie->Trump voters.  Point being that Bernie ""bros"" were not why Hillary lost. There was no ""significant"" number of them that voted for Trump, and among those that didn't vote (which is really hard to estimate how many that even is), most people who were interested in voting for Bernie hadn't even voted for Obama before",vitorsly,2025-04-27T10:17:56,3
"Appreciate the link truly.....but I don't think you are fully recognizing the trend. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanders%E2%80%93Trump_voters)  So, lets talk about the peak here and I'll admit at the outset that it is the high level and not exactly perfectly representative.   > In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, these voters composed an estimated 6%–12% of Sanders supporters.[1] At least another 12% of Sanders supporters did not vote for Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton,[2] but also did not vote for Trump.  That is 25% of the total ""Bernie Bros"" throwing their vote effectively to the other team. Now to address this being the high mark. That 6-12% surely doesn't address how many did some stupid shit like throw a vote to the Green party, Libertarian party, or wrote in Daffy Duck. So I would hold that it is very likely that 25% of the overall voter base threw a tantrum and flipped the table.  I know a lot of people want to think that the Bernie movement was such a positive thing. And if I wasn't in Arizona where by the time the primaries hit Bernie had long since lost. I would have voted for Bernie. But the problem remains the same and this comes from someone who is to the LEFT of fucking Bernie. When dealing with the progressive wing of the American left they are completely unreliable partners. We see this in the Gaza protests votes, the stay home bullshit, and the ""we were cheated"" shit. The big tent democrat party can't rely on them voting. This is why they don't get a strong voice in the party. They refuse to work within it then throw a fucking tantrum when they don't get to be in charge. Where as the MAGAs took over their party and damn sure SHOWED the fuck up over and over to drive their party to victory. I don't like those traitorous motherfuckers but I can't ignore how they made sure they took a voice in a party.  The whole premise is still stupid......Obama beat Hillary because you know what he built a narrative, built a support base that showed up to vote, and he worked within the party structure to build a coalition. Bernie did one of those things.....just one. I think Bernie is a great voice for the left and probably a great human being. But you know what HE ISN'T a great American politician. He is demonstrably bad at actually building a coalition. And yet here we are with an army of disgruntled Bernie Bros who just live in denial of that fact.   I am hopeful that it seems that AOC and Buttigeg are much better at where Bernie fails.

"> That is 25% of the total ""Bernie Bros"" throwing their vote effectively to the other team.  So 6-12% of Bernie voters voted for Trump and ~12% or more didn't vote yeah. But like I mentioned before, 24-25% of Hillary voters *actually* voted for John McCain in 2008. No number on how many Hillary voters stayed home, but even the ones that **actually** voted for Republicans is more than the approximation for those Bernie bros that voted for Trump + those that stayed home. So 25+% of 2008 Hillary fans  also ""threw a tantrum and flipped the table"".  > Another useful comparison is to 2008, when the question was whether Clinton supporters would vote for Barack Obama or John McCain (R-Ariz.) Based on data from the 2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project, a YouGov survey that also interviewed respondents multiple times during the campaign, 24 percent of people who supported Clinton in the primary as of March 2008 then reported voting for McCain in the general election.  > An analysis of a different 2008 survey by the political scientists Michael Henderson, Sunshine Hillygus and Trevor Thompson produced a similar estimate: 25 percent. (Unsurprisingly, Clinton voters who supported McCain were more likely to have negative views of African Americans, relative to those who supported Obama.)  So again, ""Bernie Bros"" were not any worse than other Primary voters.

"Again, I don't fully understand the point you are making here, in relation to the butthurt progressive vote. Am I in denial that your Kentucky Democratic voters aren't more likely to refuse to vote for a POC? Not at all.....this isn't some unknown. We see these voters in the Manchin/Bashear party group. (Not saying they are racist but the voters that they specifically court definitely peeled off to split ticket for racist ideals.) But the point is we aren't actively courting them outside of lower tier political races. The reason being because you wanna know who shows the fuck up for us? Black women and historically POC, LGBTQ+, etc.  However, when we are framing the reality and narrative around Bernie and leftist voters we see the opposite. THEY ""flip the fucking table"" and we are 10 years fucking later hearing them whine about it. Are we hearing from those Kentucky Dem's screaming WELL IF WE RIGGED IT SO BLACK PEOPLE weren't on the presidential ticket then I would be an actual democratic supporter. No we accept that it's a decision made by the party through things like primaries that we get who we get. Except my whole take here is about the fucking trolling about Bernie being robbed and how the party isn't left enough. When they have shown over and over again especially the youth left vote refuses to show up. It's the epitomy of Republicans fall in line and Democrats have to fall in love. But just like dating you can't stop looking because everyone you go on a date with isn't your soulmate. You go and keep working at it till you find someone who is right for you. Can you imagine if everyone went on one date didn't love the person then bitched about how the system was rigged and the app they met on was shit because they didn't score their perfect someone on that date?  It's literal buffoonery.......I understand the frustration I really fucking do. But it's the same MAGA mentality that's tanking our electorate and strengthening theirs.
