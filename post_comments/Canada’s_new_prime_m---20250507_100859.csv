"I made it one paragraph before laughing myself out of my chair at this idiotic opinion piece.  >Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carney is not your average political leader. He didn’t rise through the ranks of parliament or build his political clout through years of constituency work. He is an unelected central banker turned international power broker with deep ties to the World Economic Forum, the Great Reset movement and the ESG (Environmental, social and governance) agenda.    Lmfao. ""Unelected.""  He was literally elected party leader and MP of Nepean.  Perhaps the author needs to learn how Canada figures out who becomes the prime minister.  It's the leader of the party that wins the federal election.  What a two bit propagandist.   It then goes on with ""Great Reset"" conspiracy theories.  How he's going to start a CBDCs to track everyone is in there.  How he's going to somehow end the hegemony of the dollar as if Trump isn't working to do that on his own right now.  How ""the globalists"" are coming for everyone.  Typical insane far right fan fiction shit.  The degree of stupidity and conspiracy theory thinking is astounding.  This is actually published somewhere.  These people really do live in an alternate universe.",TriflingHotDogVendor,2025-05-07T10:51:23,7

That’s what you have America?! That is your casus belli?!  For real though; we have no desire to take you down.  Having an even more failed state on our border would serve absolutely no benefit to us.  All we want is for you to leave us alone- that’s it.,Mala_Practice,2025-05-07T10:42:59,6

">the controversial Great Reset initiative, which proposes reimagining capitalism and reshaping global economies around equity, sustainability and stakeholder governance.     ESG the new boogey-man?    > If Carney has his way, Canada will serve as a prototype for the kind of top-down, centrally planned society that the World Economic Forum envisions for the entire Western world.   Holy Hyperbole, Batman!  equating ESG corporate policies and ""top-down, centrally planned society"" conspiracies like The Great Reset is, IMO, really stretching it.  purposely finding something were there is nothing. sorta like finding faces and other familiar shapes when cloud gazing,",squintytoast,2025-05-07T10:52:35,3
"Hold up -- isn't MAGA a ""RESET"" of sorts? MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN literally invokes a return to a previous state - e.g. a reset from our current conditions. They are telling us we're in a ""transitional"" period... they have stated plans to wind down our service-based economy and reset to a time of industrial factory-based manufacturing.",dietTAB,2025-05-07T11:07:52,3
