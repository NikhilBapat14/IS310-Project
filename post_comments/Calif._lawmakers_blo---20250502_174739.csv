"From what I’ve gathered, the California lawmakers who opposed the bill aren’t objecting to criminalizing the act of paying for sex with 16- or 17-year-olds—it’s already illegal under current law, and they support that. Their concern lies in preserving judicial discretion rather than imposing a uniform, mandatory penalty across all cases.  They believe there’s an important difference between, for example, an 18-year-old and a 50-year-old committing the same offense of soliciting sex—and that judges should have the ability to take such distinctions into account. This isn’t a debate about whether those who solicit sex from minors should be punished—they already are. It’s a debate between codifying fixed universal sentencing and allowing courts the discretion to weigh context and have a tiered system of punishment.",Prometheus321,2025-05-03T09:26:42,74

"A new bill meant to protect sex trafficking victims, AB 379, would have upped that age to 18, but Democratic committee members demanded the clause be cut before they let the bill move forward in the California State Assembly.  This is just what the left does, it desires to maintain or promote their perverse nature!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T19:02:13,77
