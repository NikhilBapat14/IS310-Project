The whole point of DOGE is that selected few get paid for six-figure salaries to install backdoors and sell your data to the highest bidder.,thieh,2025-04-28T12:25:52,115
"They aren't auditors! Mass media has normalized the most insidious security breach in US history. muskrat and his traitor tots aren't zeroing in on the most sensitive data in the country just to save a few bucks. Their purpose is twofold:  1. Copy sensitive databases to offsite servers, then exploit for political and personal financial gain. 2. Deflect blame from trump, the Republican party, and Project 2025, as the public blames their draconian measures on ""DOGE.""",charcoalist,2025-04-28T12:32:27,58

The cuts to the IRS alone are going to cost America $500 billion dollars in uncollected taxes.,biscuitarse,2025-04-28T13:03:21,22
"The truth is that most government doesn't actually have that much waste.  Instead, this is government brought to you by ""If I just quit my job, I can save a hundred dollars in gas a month!""",QaraKha,2025-04-28T13:46:32,10

"That's because it hasn't. They demanded insane salaries, made tons of mistakes about firings, caused increases in aircraft accidents. They suggested 2 Trillion in cuts. They got about 150 billion and their cost of operation was about the same. They did nothing but cause suffering without tangible benefit and while damaging services people use. They made us less safe. Even worse, Elez supposedly installed a backdoor in the treasury payment systems in addition to other depts. There's more to the story. I would be surprised if these people aren't in jail or dead in 10 years when everything comes to light.",MonarchMagnetic,2025-04-28T15:40:35,2
"Doge was about data theft, not waste since there is very little as anyone who had applied for existing programs would know. Federal workers are thorough and diligent about their jobs. It is doubtful they found any real waste but definitely cut people who qualified.",Stonkasaurus1,2025-04-28T16:33:43,2

DOGE is government waste. Rapey the Clown can still play golf at the expense of hundreds of Millions of Dollars though.,void_operator,2025-04-28T18:37:51,2
**TLDR:**  * **President Trump created DOGE to identify inefficiencies and pare down the size of government.** * **A new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll showed that most Americans don't see reductions in waste or fraud.** * **The development comes as Elon Musk recently said he'd be stepping back from DOGE to focus on Tesla.**,thisisinsider,2025-04-28T12:23:04,4

This guy tried to get us to believe he was the number #4 player in the world on Path of Exile 2 hardcore and then streamed himself playing and dying to the tutorial boss in Act 1. He's a total fraud. He can say whatever he wants at this point and nobody will believe him.,LavaRacing,2025-04-29T00:31:24,1
