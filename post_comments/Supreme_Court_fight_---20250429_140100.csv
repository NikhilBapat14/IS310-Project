"The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a [blockbuster dispute over the nation’s first religious charter school](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/politics/st-isidore-catholic-charter-school-supreme-court/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit), a case that critics say has prompted a “crisis of identity” in the school choice movement and that could vastly expand taxpayer funding for religious education.  The battle over St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma has pit public school officials, traditional charter school advocates and the state’s Republican attorney general against powerful religious groups who say a series of recent opinions from the court’s 6-3 conservative majority has all-but already decided the case in their favor.  Charter schools – privately run but publicly funded – serve 3.8 million students in the US, offering an alternative to traditional public schools that are intended to be more innovative and less bound by state regulations. The concept took off in the 1990s and, by the 2023 school year, there were some 8,000 charter schools operating nationwide.  A ruling for St. Isidore could effectively redefine charter schools as private entities, even though most state laws – including Oklahoma’s – deem them to be public schools. That could open the door to other religious charter schools applying for funding, critics say, or it could prompt some states to restrict the schools or abandon them altogether.",cnn,2025-04-29T14:02:30,2

"Religion will always try to take over. It is the very essence of it, of all religions. How can they possibly be the “truth” if they aren’t taught in schools, made into laws, and followed by everyone. Funny thing, the Christian Bible actual prohibits public worship, and yet the Christian religions quickly ignored that when they discovered the power of the pulpit and the money making of the weekly public donations. It’s all a scam and historically ruined everything it takes control of.",AmrokMC,2025-04-29T14:35:19,2

"This is also about paying for private school for children of multi-millionaires.   The way this works is those private school can deny disable students from attending. They can set mandatory parent-teacher meeting during work hours so child of blue collar working parents cannot attend.  They don't provide transpiration so poor children can't attend. They set school prices above what the vouchers pay for so poor families cannot afford the schools.   They have numerous ways to keep disadvantaged kids our of their schools, but take tax payer money so that multi-millionaire parents pay less for the schooling.",Captain_Aware4503,2025-04-29T14:55:51,1

"Paying for teaching hours spent on a standard non-religious curriculum is fine, if they can do it at least a little less expensively than public schools. The politicians screaming the loudest against private schools often sent or send their kids to private schools. They should explain why before saying another word.  Teaching non-religious classes isn't the same as paying for teaching a religion. The schools and the parents can pick up the religious teaching costs.",Candid_Report955,2025-04-29T14:07:09,1

"Jesus himself warned against false shepherds and houses of public worship loudly proclaiming their faith for clout, instead saying to pray quietly at home because God could hear you just fine at home.
