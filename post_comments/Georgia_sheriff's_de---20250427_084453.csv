"This smells fishier than an F150’s coolant system. The guy who shot at the police died at the scene, that much I could gather from the article. Something went horribly wrong here and the fact that the police didn’t give out any info makes it very clear that this isn’t an open and shut case of self defense on their part.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-27T09:12:47,-8
