"This headline does not tell the whole story. They sent $10M in medicaid to a charity run by his wife, who then gave it to a non profit, who then gave most of it to Desantis as a campaign contribution. So Desantis stole $10M in medicaid money for himself.",SadBadPuppyDad,2025-04-22T13:36:08,3619

"Kicked the tires on your post. Well done, buddy.  > That‚Äôs the exact amount DeSantis officials settled on with Centene last year. But instead of returning all $67 million to state and federal coffers, they sent $10 million of it to the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity overseen by first lady Casey DeSantis. The money was then sent to two nonprofit organizations that aren‚Äôt required to report how they spend their funds. Those ‚Äúdark money‚Äù groups later gave $8.5 million to a political committee overseen by DeSantis‚Äô chief of staff in a series of transactions that some Republican lawmakers believe was illegal.

"Just to clarify a few things for accuracy‚Äôs sake‚ÄîDeSantis didn‚Äôt literally pocket the $10 million. What happened is that $10M from a Medicaid fraud settlement with a healthcare contractor was directed not back into the state budget, but into a charity initiative run by his wife. That charity then passed the money to two nonprofits, which in turn funneled most of it into a political committee connected to DeSantis‚Äô inner circle. That committee then used the money to fight a marijuana legalization ballot measure.  So no, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äústeal it for himself‚Äù in a personal sense, but the end result is still troubling: public healthcare money that should‚Äôve helped Floridians went through a maze of nonprofits and ended up funding political activity. It raises real questions about transparency, ethics, and whether public funds are being used for political gain.
