"while animal testing is cruel its a necessary part of developing new drugs still, this was being done on bacterial diseases. computer generated models are no where close to being effective yet at assessing viability of safe drugs for anti-biotics. (most computer models struggle with more than a dozen or so atoms, biologically derived medicines have hundreds or more atoms, the idea we can ai new drugs and tell how they interact in our bodies for safety is still very far off). For reference prior to discovering the enzyme in horseshoe crabs that turns blue upon contact with foreign dna (how we made the quick bacteria test), doctors would innoculate a dozen or so rabbits with your blood and perform an autopsy to determine the disease, this was less than 70 years ago. Don't let a trump supporting tabloid fool you into thinking this was done at some sense of humane treatment, its totally in line with rfj jr and his belief in [miasma theory (apparently he does not acceot germ theory)](https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/understanding-rfk-jr)",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-06T16:05:17,5

What he could do is have a congressional committee in charge of this - one that can take action - obviously, one that wishes to not absorb everyone because it's too costly right now - and then let them do what they need to do. Obama was able to deport 3 million? Trump has only deported 64k because of the stays. ICE is finding the people who have been tried and convicted and ordered to leave (but not detained earlier), but they're in holding until SCOTUS decides.
