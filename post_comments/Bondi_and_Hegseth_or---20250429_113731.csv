"One of the real weaknesses of our governmental system is that a sitting president can invent, exacerbate, or even cause a crisis, then use that crisis as an excuse to grab more power.   Remember when George W Bush got the presidential daily briefing warning that bin Laden was determined to attack inside the United States, one month before bin Laden attacked on 9/11? Instead of acting to stop bin Laden, Bush went on vacation for a month, only 9 months into his presidency. Bush's approval rating dropped so low because of his perceived laziness, into the low 50%, that he scheduled a photo op reading a book called The Pet Goat with some school children. That's what he was doing when the two planes hit. When Bush was told by the secret service, he did nothing, because he didn't know what to do. As a result of the attack on 9/11, Americans rallied around Bush, and Bush's approval rating rose up from the low 50s to over 90%. Bush blamed his own incompetence on a lack of executive power, and began bugging Americans' phones, and used it as an opportunity to start wars in foreign lands to grab resources and fend off his critics.  Unfortunately we may be caught in a positive feedback loop where Trump does something stupid and incompetent which causes a crisis, which causes him to be granted more power, which he will abuse to create even more crises, which will then cause him to get more power, and so on.   Too bad we can't impeach him rather than implode the entire country, right?",NotThatAngel,2025-04-29T16:51:29,2

"I expect that the military for the most part, willfully, if not gleefully will attack citizens. Just like the militia dummies and 2A cretins that everyone knew were just racists with guns in the woods have showed their stripes by protecting Tesla dealerships. The former FBI has released multiple reports that the white supremacist organizations of the early 90's had regrouped in the form of becoming part of law enforcement and the military.  I first read of this in 2015(ish) in the Guardian. The government reports are out there to find, unless this administration removed them under DEI suspicion by now. I am far too tired to find the links anymore, no one cared then and even less seem to now.  There is likely a whole army within these institutions just waiting for the race war dog whistle.  We really squandered this whole democracy thing, didn't we? Everyone got so greedy and complacent that we allowed the religious right destroy education to the point where they didn't even have to try that hard to get half of the US to think those silly rights were dumb to begin with. ""That constitution applies to brown immigrants? Toss it out, Murica!""  These incompetent ghouls blatantly exploit the innumeracy and ignorance of the mouth breathers the void of education left us with. Displaying tariff costs on a receipt? ""That's a hostile political move and remember BIDEN?"" **Information is hostile to their cause**, they said it out loud -- and half the country will wave a Trump flag for it. It's classic authoritarianism but no one knows anything about history anymore and words over 3 syllables hurt brain.  Academics, intellectuals, among others already fleeing the country. Judges being arrested. Concentration camps in El Salvador, no warrant raids. Taunting the supreme court justices with arrest. A trade war with no plan. Trillions wiped from the global economy, and now militarization of the police -- against what crime wave? Most crime statistics have been going down over the last couple decades. That is except for the high crimes coming from this administration and christian fascist conservative everywhere.  And yes, religion is at fault here. No one is more amenable to magic think and information resistant than the folks that invented it.  I do not believe that all of the 60ish% of american's that identify as Christian are fascist. However, I do think the is a decent percentage that are too embarrassed (at best) or indoctrinated (groomed in the parlance of the internet) to speak out against what is happening because your tax exempt mega church or otherwise is really just a heritage foundation funded vehicle for reassuring your fallacious world view that regulations are bad for corporations. That's really the whole point, ain't it?  All of this happened in a 100+ days, this wasn't a slow boil, death by a thousand cuts. It's pure complacency of the electorate and the greed of every single politician who forgot that there are no backup adults to come and fix things, this isn't a fucking twitter argument.
