">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told private investors during a meeting on Tuesday that the spiraling trade war between the United States and China was unsustainable and that he expects a ""de-escalation"" soon, according to a report from the Associated Press (AP).  What this means is China is not backing down. Japan is not playing around. Trump and Republicans have to fix their shit ASAP before people find out.  There have been zero negotiations with China and Xi hasn't even talked to Trump in forever.  >Trump hasn’t spoken with Xi since returning to the White House, the longest a US president has gone without talking to his Chinese counterpart post-inauguration in 20 years.",tech57,2025-04-23T10:39:41,2
