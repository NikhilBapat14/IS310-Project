"First thing that's important to know - he will only be Prime Minister temporarily. An election is almost guaranteed to happen soon. Canadians will decide if he continues on as Prime Minister or if the reins get handed to the opposition party.  He brings technical expertise and serious educational chops, being the governor of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England in the past. This is already a direct contrast to Donald Trump, and Carney's election in itself can be seen as a strong statement against the anti-intellectual and anti-globalist movement in the U.S. Compared to Trudeau, he will move the Liberal party from centre-left to centre-right.  The anti-Trump and pro-Canadian sentiment is popular in Canada. This will be the backdrop to his (or any Prime Minister's) policies moving forward, as the Canadian economy shifts away from entanglement with the U.S. to boosting home-grown productivity and diversifying trade.",GKJ5,2025-03-09T21:41:11,159

"Suddenly everyone, especially here in the UK, is interested in Canadian politics, partly because of Trump and partly because of Carney, who until recently was Governor of the Bank of England. and is an expert in economics. Carney is a grown-up with a quietly spoken, very intelligent demeanour - which makes him an easy target for Trump as part of the ""liberal elite"" and may make him unsuited for the down and dirty style of the Trump administration. Trouble ahead, whatever way you look at it.  My ideal scenario would be for Canadians to become a voice for the anti-Trump movement in the United States, and thereby upset Trump's plan. Certainly American liberals - though perhaps not the American Left - must be looking at Carney with a sigh of (albeit temporary) relief.",TomLondra,2025-03-10T03:12:41,15

Those efin tarifs wouldn't hurt half as much if we weren't already all struggling financially!   PLEASE  open your eyes, remember what the Liberals have done, and consider that Mr Carney has lobbied and assisted to create policy and law that have RESULTED  in increasing his wealth.

"He’s going to have some real questions about his policies.  But he’s well respected as a figure broadly in Canada.

How will he do that and does it involve rolling back some of the lower impact social programs the Trudeau administration implemented.  -How will he “nation build” Canada, which is what the country is craving.  Will he be repealing the environmental laws that drove away energy investments in Canada?  -What’s his immigration plan?  -What’s his defence and foreign policy plan?",Baulderdash77,2025-03-09T22:21:50,3

That being said, many Canadians aren't happy with Trudeau in more ways than one and don't want to vote for someone who agreed with everything Trudeau said up until 3 months ago. It's obvious to everyone that the Liberals only turned on him because his approval rating tanked, and it's hard to trust someone who clearly has no values of their own.

There will certainly be an election very soon.    He's smarter, better educated, and obviously far, far more experienced in economics than Trudeau.  How that translates to the rough and tumble of real politics and real leadership remains to be seen.

"I am optimistic for Carney as PM. We need a strong experienced leader against Donald Trump. I can appreciate ppl who were dissatisfied against Trudeau to consider Poilievre, however many of PP’s supporters are also Trump supporters and very divisive. This will not work. Carney said in his acceptance speech that he is a pragmatist and will fix things that are broken. Looking forward to seeing what his plan is. (PP never really has plans, only complaints. In fact, even when his party was in power, he would answer questions by deflecting and attacking his opponents. We don’t have time for PP‘s non-answers.

"According to Financial times Canada was set to be fastest growing economy in G7 in 2025, before Trump's Tarrifs. Mark Carney also has the only economic experience to convince Trump of a better solution, while also reducing economic losses and increasing gains at quick rates. We really need someone who knows what they are doing and I just don't believe Pierre has what it takes. Well, Mark was the governor of the Bank of England and Canada and knows how to make business and Canada grow economically. He also wants to get the pipelines and infrastructure done quickly, but wants to be responsible about it. And I know conservatives have given him heat for that, but being responsible and environmentally friendly doesn't have to be a bad thing. Doing so may even give him more leverage with those provinces that had been previously hesitant. These are all genuinely important points to consider. I believe based on all the facts Mark Carney is the best person for the job. That being said, the best person for the job doesn’t always win. It's definitely leaning conservative, but even conservatives can see Mark's experience might be what really counts right now.  Pierres pokes at Mark for investing globally and also being one of multiple advisors to Trudeau is a bit of a weak argument given his own lack of experience economically. And then there's Elon Musk who is funding Pierre and Trump who supports him. I'm guessing that's not for the right reasons. Pierre has even gone as far as taking Trumps talking points in speeches. It definitely makes it hsrder to convince people that he's team Canada. I'm just saying he has some image problems. There won't be a majority either way. I think people are a little concerned about either party taking full control.",Content_Program_1371,2025-03-14T15:47:12,1

"You know that when you use heavily encoded words from your algorithmic bubble from someone who isn’t in that bubble it sounds like nonsense, right? Your phrasing is contingent on absolutes and rhetoric, which makes it entirely unconvincing. Should people be sceptical about Carney? Sure. But I’ve been following Poilievre for a very long time. He’s all bark and little substance. Though I understand that’s his public persona, and the actual guy is more thoughtful and informed than he lets on. I’ve read Carney has some undesirable personality traits, but you know what he does have: expertise in finance, which would be immensely helpful in a trade war. Poilievre’s expertise is in being an attack dog. Fine for opposition but not for going up against a bully many orders of magnitude more powerful than he is. The Liberal Party is one of the most successful centrist parties in the world. One of the reasons why is that they pivot. Trudeau pivoted left post-Harper and to hold on with minority governments, and Carney is going to pivot back to the centre. At this point, Canada has to tighten relationships with its remaining allies, and Carney would be well-positioned to do that, if he were to win the election. Poilievre? Skippy? Not so much. And I really don’t buy his makeover, with his losing the glasses and pretending like he’s a working class hero.

"Most nations of the world and virtually every developed nation (including the US - until Trump withdrew from it) have agreed on a 15% minimum corporate tax rate. You can tax corporations *more* if you want, but you can't tax them less than that.  The goal of this is to end corporate tax evasion/shopping, where corporations have been setting up their legal HQ's in places like Ireland, Cyprus, etc to pay far lower taxes than they should be paying for where they actually conduct most of their operations/business.  This was going to be **good** for us, because we're a wealthy place that companies are always looking out for ways to dodge taxes from, and would make it far less attractive to bother trying it.  ------  I will also remind that:  - The effective US corporate tax rate is right around this level - while it's 21% nominally, in practice with the various ""legal"" methods of tax evasion the effective US corporate tax rate is right around that 15% mark.  - While there **was** a time when corporate tax inversions (moving HQ out of the US to dodge taxes) were a thing with companies trying to dodge the US's unique and bizarre taxation scheme that was in place historically, that was pretty much resolved with a bunch of legal + policy changes in 2014-17 or so.     - Trump does actually get a small amount of credit here as part of fixing that was one of the few smart pieces of the 2017 TJCA.  > They tax American companies less than their own companies - a 15% corporate tax rate to lure jobs to Canada.   That's the same tax rate they charge their own companies, not a lower one.  -----  Please provide some sort of source or evidence for your claims that:  - American companies operating in Canada are taxed less than Canadian companies are.  - Anyone has actually done a Canadian tax inversion/HQ move for tax reasons after 2017, when they finished closing most of the reasons this was at one time an attractive accounting trick.
