"Everyone in the democratic party was really shaken when Clinton didn't win. The thinking goes that if there is a large enough youth or african american voter base to actually show up at the polls, then we get to elect whoever we want (such as Obama). But if those groups stay home, then we need *every* independent voter, including the backwoods ones. Which means our canidate can't be Harris, too racially diverse and a woman, can't be Buttigieg, too gay. Even the straight white male Newsom has the stigma of being from California, which so so many people in the middle of the country see as being the root of all evil.    The general belief was that A) Biden was the best shot for beating Trump, he's done it before, and B) because of this, and with him having the advantage of being the incumbent, he would win the primaries.    However, the problem is it was known it would be a very close race. For decades the democratic party has been defined by its diversity - which has been a strength in cultivating talent and culture, but a weakness in getting everyone to vote together, especially when compared to the GOP.    For the first time in decades, the DNC was so frightened of the possibilty of a second Trump term that we took a page out of the GOP's playbook, and no one challenged Biden for reelection. There are many, many reasons why this was the logical move. If Biden is the best chance to beat Trump, and by far the most likely to win the primaries, and challenging him in the primaries means he has to spend money which could be saved for the general - then why do it? It made sense at the time. We just all had to hope that Biden wouldn't be too old.",bmilohill,2024-07-07T14:31:55,10
"A simple answer would be that Biden seemed fine in the State of the Union, and he seemed fine in his February physical.  Why rock the boat against an incumbent with a proven track record, especially fighting against another former President?  Republicans have also been screaming about how Biden is a drooling invalid for years, which meant that if you were on the other side of the aisle you would ignore it as a matter of course given that Trump and his party regularly tout theories with little to no basis.     Entirely possible that Biden was fine, until he just wasn't. Which is common with the elderly.",Maladal,2024-07-07T17:33:56,4
"The DNC rigged the primary for Biden because they wanted a pro-war, pro-corporate candidate like Biden.  They could win with Kennedy, but it seems like they'd rather lose with Biden than win with Kennedy.  Polling shows that Kennedy hasÂ [the highest favorability of all the 2024 presidential candidates](https://gvwire.com/2024/01/15/rfk-jr-leads-all-presidential-contenders-in-favorability-gallup-poll/), and [polling also shows that Kennedy would beat Trump in a 1v1](https://www.kennedy24.com/spoiler), and that he'sÂ [pulling more votes from Trump than from Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-candidacy-hurts-trump-biden-nbc-news-poll-finds-rcna148536).  Biden would lose to Trump whether or not Kennedy was in the race, but Kennedy would beat Trump if Biden was not in the race.  By definition, Biden is the real spoiler, not Kennedy.

Establishment couldn't risk an outsider like Bernie coming in and screwing up their agenda. So they shoe'd in Kamala and told voters she's the most accomplished candidate possible. Same number of primary votes as Ronald McDonald. #threattodemocracy,Famous_Midnight,2024-10-07T05:47:02,1
"You need to think about it from the standpoint of an insider rather than an average voter.  For you or I, the choice of Biden vs. (whomever) does not have a direct impact on our lives. No matter who wins in November, we'll go to work the next day, we'll be living in the same place and our problems will be the same.  For the people who form the inner circle of the various political candidates, the vote in November will radically change their lives. Biden is surrounded by people whose fate is directly tied to his political fortunes. If he wins, they have a great jobs where they make good money and wield enormous influence. If he loses? They probably need to find a new career. They certainly need to find a new job.  Do you really think such people are thinking objectively about what is best for the country? Or are they focused on riding Biden's success as long as possible to put off the day when they're cast out into the (political) wilderness?  Since the various loyalists dependent on Biden are the ones who had all the information - and worked so hard to conceal it from the public - this deprived non-Biden Democrats of the narrative they needed to oust him. As long as they could claim that reports of Biden's decline were some sort of Republican trick, they could keep a revolt of rank and file Democrats from occurring.",ViskerRatio,2024-07-07T13:41:48,2

"Biden hasn't been all there the entire time he's been in office people just want to ignore the fact that he's been declining the entire time. Kinda easy to ignore when you only see good news and none of his off script rambling.  Absolutely insane to nominate a candidate with zero primary votes while screaming the opposition is a threat to democracy. No one liked Kamala in 2020 primaries for all the same reasons people dislike her today.   Watching the 2020 debates it absolutely blows my mind that she became Biden's VP. When asked how she could now support someone she repeatedly proved to be a racist and a liar her only response was ""it was a debate!, it was a debate! (Kackling!)"" ðŸ¤£  No way the DNC establishment wanted to take the risk of an outsider like Bernie screwing up their agenda. They don't just hate Trump, they hate anyone not in their club.... Why sue RFK in nearly every state to keep him off the ballot if you are the party of democracy? #gianthypocracy",Famous_Midnight,2024-10-07T05:50:03,0

"There can be some truth to that. However, smart, effective people can and are held over between administrations. Biden said early in his administration that he thought of himself as a transitional candidate. If that frame of mind had continued, it would be relatively ""easy"" (given the complexities of politics) to make arrangements that many would have been held over into the next administration. Also, it's relatively common for people in the higher levels of a presidential administration to move onto even more lucrative jobs in the private sector, like in lobbying or think tanks.  I feel that people wanting to keep their jobs and hiding info about Biden is less of a factor than other things like wanting to keep Biden's policy initiatives going smoothly (and Biden has done a terrific job with those, given the circumstances), Biden's ego, or other potential candidates not wanting to run at this time.",WanderingMindTravels,2024-07-08T08:50:58,1
"Trump was challenged by Joe Walsh, Bill Weld, and Mark Sanford in 2020. Obama wasn't seriously challenged in 2012, but only because Bernie Sanders was talked out of it. George W wasn't seriously challenged. Clinton was challenged by Jimmy Griffen and Roland Riemers.    For the most part there hasn't been *serious* challenges due to Carter, but theres still been a few, especially when the sitting president looked weak",bmilohill,2024-07-08T10:13:36,1

"It seems they'd rather have a candidate like Trump who would keep the corrupt gravy train flowing than have an honest anti-corruption anti-war candidate like Kennedy.  Obviously, they'd rather have Biden than Trump, but neither would stop the gravy train.  Kennedy would.  The DNC and Kennedy seem to be on opposing sides of many issues, especially regarding corruption, war, transparency, the corrupt merger of coporations and government, and civil liberties.  Kennedy has spent 40 yearsÂ fighting corruption and [winning landmark legal cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/RFKJrForPresident/comments/1b7dnje/moms_for_rfk_jr_here_are_just_a_few_of_the_things/)Â by studying and using high-quality scientific evidence to prove his claims in court, and he hasÂ [successfully sued numerous corrupt polluters, law-breaking pharmaceutical companies, and law-breaking government agencies like the EPA, FDA, CDC, NIH, USDA, etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/RFKJrForPresident/comments/1b5ksu1/ive_probably_sued_epa_more_than_any_other/).

"I did not say that ""DNC has nothing to do with the federal government"" and if you somehow read that you should take some time off from the internet.  I said that the DNC's internal processes have no relation to the government's election process, and it's true.  The DNC and the GOP are private entities that work to put people into public office, but they are not part of the government itself. Nowhere in our constitution is there reference made to such groups. They are an entirely ancillary process.  They are a process that has become an expected part of our modern political world, but they are not necessary at all to make it run.  Therefore they can appoint whoever they want to be their candidate in whatever method they very well please. They could put everyone in a circle and spin the bottle to select VP and POTUS candidates and it would still be valid to put on a ballot. Anyone who meets the minimum requirements can be put on the ballot.  There is nothing illegitimate about Harris' nomination within the confines of the DNC or in the laws of the federal government.  If anyone doesn't agree they're free to not vote for her in order to express that opinion.",Maladal,2024-10-07T11:18:30,1
"Sure are proud about there being no primary. Only the second time in US history has a candidate been selected without being voted for by the people. A longtime tradition; And the only time in modern history. If Republicans did this the establishment media would have had a total meltdown! And people on TikTok would be screaming about trump being a dictator that wasn't voted for  Not to mention they selected someone that wasnt even liked during the 2020 debates at that, she's been no existent the last four years then paraded out like a roman war hero. As an independent I can think of so many other democrats I would rather vote for.   I can assure you the people running the DNC are very connected to those in the federal government. Your point is basically a non poit; It's like stating cheese is dairy that's why cheeseburger is a cheeseburger.

"-I would like you to demonstrate where exactly in that comment I exhibited pride.  -What does it matter if the candidate isn't nominated by a democratic process if they're still elected to the office by one? Being nominated by a democratic process is not one of the requirements to be on the ballot.  Some schmuck living in bumfuck Iowa who doesn't even know their representative's name could put their name on the ballot across all 50 states and win legitimately.  -Tradition is not law. Traditionally we never elected a person of color to the POTUS but we've done it once and likely will again.  -Oh there would be a meltdown? Like the conservative bloc is having over this? There's nothing illicit, it's just part of political smear.  -For the second time, I did not say the DNC was not in the federal government and you won't find that in my comment. Stop trying to argue against a point I didn't make.   -If he's on the ballot legitimately for those states then he'll be fine. And RFK is fighting to get back on ballots even after dropping out of the race so he can be a spoiler candidate. So I'm not going to wring my hands over it much.",Maladal,2024-10-07T17:24:02,1
