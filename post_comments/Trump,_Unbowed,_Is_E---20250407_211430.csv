If you didn't know the retribution part of the plan was the plan you've had your head in the sand (or somewhere else) for the last 6 years.  If you didn't know the project 2025 part of the plan was the plan you didn't pay any attention when it was widely circulated and then denied.,CockBrother,2025-04-07T21:16:46,1
Trump told everyone who would listen this was always part of the plan. Republicans just didn't care and wanted to win.  Now we are all paying the price.,KasherH,2025-04-07T21:16:18,1
"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > No American president has disrupted so many aspects of the nation’s daily life as President Trump has in less than three months in office. His no-apologies agenda has made him the focal point of crucial decisions now being made in America’s C-suites, on factory floors, in faculty lounges, elementary-school libraries and capitals around the world—as well as around kitchen tables across the U.S.  > He has moved with astonishing speed to enact an immigration crackdown, cut the federal workforce and demolish federal agencies. He is checking off a list of perceived enemies, firing people at will and slashing at major law firms that some advisers allege once aided investigations into his actions. Asserting a broad mandate, Trump has worked with little regard for public criticism. In typical is-he-serious-or-not form, Trump now flirts with seeking a third term.  > “He’s going after all these targets with a sense of presidential power that is unbound,” said Princeton historian Julian Zelizer. “Where this goes next is a mystery.”  > [...]  > Trump’s tariffs—an effort to reshape the global trading system—have put many Americans in a defensive pose as they decide how to handle the likelihood of higher prices and a rout in the market that wiped out $6.6 trillion in market value last week. Foreign governments are deciding whether to fight or negotiate new tariffs or accede. America’s allies and adversaries are reviewing their military spending as they consider a world in which Trump uses America’s military and economic muscle to squeeze every advantage from other countries at the expense of U.S. alliances.  > [...]  > The president is getting the results he wants from many of his actions, especially as he moves to strip elite universities and law firms, as well as parts of the culture he deems as too liberal, of some of their power. Some law firms are striking deals to offer millions of dollars in free services to avoid crippling sanctions threatened by Trump, such as loss of their security clearances. Some Ivy League universities and other schools are changing their diversity policies and other practices under threat of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-07T21:15:03,1
