The deal: US removes tariffs for nothing¬†,MariosBrother1,2025-05-07T21:49:51,25
How long before he forgets and breaks the deal because he thinks Biden did it.,Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-07T21:59:27,11
"Trump of course lied when he said he had already made two hundred trade deals.  He is now telling us that this is the first one.  It probably isn‚Äòt a trade deal either, but rather just another lie.  It is sad and pathetic that everyone, even his imbecile base of knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing morons, just assumes that everything Trump says is a lie. And no one is ever wrong. But this is what authoritarian dictators do: They fire an endless stream of bullshit.  And trump has certainly mastered that part.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-07T22:08:21,9

they probably scammed him with one of those fake lordships you can buy for like $20 online in exchange to lift tariffs.,oh-shazbot,2025-05-07T22:24:07,3
I really hope this is for the smallest amount of sectors as possible as the Yanks have always had insane demands for previous trade talks - ie insisting we accept their unsafe food.¬†   Maybe this is a small Trump bonus for us that he's so desperate for a trade win right now that we'll actually get to grab a US industry!,bowak,2025-05-08T02:02:09,3

That is what I don't get Canada and Mexico signed a deal with him last time.  And he says it is the worst deal ever.  So his deals are worthless.,Specialist_Cicada200,2025-05-07T22:02:14,12

"California would be the 5th largest economy in the world as an independent state, so one could argue this says more about California than it does about the 189 counties with smaller GDPs.
