"""Senate Democratic sources whisper that Klobuchar is less popular than Schatz among colleagues, but they acknowledge she’s a “talented” leader and has an edge over her colleague from Hawaii when it comes to speaking at press conferences and putting together bipartisan legislation.""  Fuck bipartisan legislation. You don't deal with Nazis.",oldguydrinkingbeer,2025-04-24T07:15:45,9
Can't say I like any of them much but have a had dealing with Schatz and his office and would prefer him over the others due to his younger age. Retirement age politicians are dragging the whole country down.,following_eyes,2025-04-24T06:48:44,3
