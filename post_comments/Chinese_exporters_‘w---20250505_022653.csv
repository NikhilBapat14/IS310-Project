"Yeah, this was expected to eventually occur. China will utilize some of the countries it built up good relations with and invested in with the Belt and Road Initiative to use them as the ""origin"" point for stuff they produced.",Shiplord13,2025-05-05T02:32:29,97
"Oh lookee here, Trump not only caused Asian countries to strengthen ties with China, he caused a boom in the inter-asian shipping industry, all while increasing MAGA hat costs 145%.  Well done.  When products are this indistinct, ""source washing"" is common.  Sanctioned oil-rich countries like Russia know this flow inside-out, as does America.  Americans are not about to clamor to get 145% added to the price of goods like wood flooring. DOH!  Trump obviously doesn't understand Capitalism - as his serial bankruptcies show.  Market  inefficiencies always produce black markets - in ways his tiny brain can't conceive.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-05T02:46:43,80

"Product washing in order to evade taxes is old. During the Reagan era auto quota etc there were shenanigans to classify japanese stuff as American. Apparently as the auto industry press reported, ""$9 of Japanese components assembled by a minimum wage American worker into a $1 American made box equals $10 of American parts""...",debugprint,2025-05-05T05:11:09,4
"Since the beginning of recorded history, traders find routes that avoid taxes.  Black market, gray market. Black market is illegal trade. Gray market? It’s legal-ish.  Trump and the republicans don’t have their pants on yet. These channels were being developed the day Trump first said “tariffs”.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-05T03:57:58,4

"Sorry, but Trump is not as stupid as everyone thinks. Unfortunately, his series of bankruptcies was a way to evade the tax authorities, and now he is drowning the United States in lertme because for him it is a good way to evade the court.  In the end, the law enforcement system of the United States and the special services of the United States will not be able to extract and punish Trump from the same Russia if the United States themselves are gutted to the roots.  In fact, he is now pulling off his trick with tax evasion on a superpower scale.  He bankrupts a company even when there are no reasons for bankruptcy.  He transfers the remaining money to his own account and then leaves with the money, leaving the business to drown.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-05T04:20:59,-1

"Indeed. The US is a big player economically, and most countries would rather not trade less with them, it's not really beneficial to anyone to have a trade war.  Alas, it wasn't our call. Trump just started throwing his weight around to make himself feel big and made it a matter of practical necessity for everyone else to start actively seeking out more trade opportunities elsewhere.  Even if the US dumps MAGA in 4 years, by that point, there will be a new status quo that won't involve America as much or in the same way as it used to.",Optimism_Deficit,2025-05-05T02:49:33,9

Interesting that other developers and casino owners aren’t as smart? /s A well run casino will definitely be more profitable than the offset of a tax liability. I think some post-hoc rationalization is at play here.,Impressive_Ad_5614,2025-05-05T06:56:07,12
">Sorry, but Trump is not as stupid as everyone thinks. Unfortunately, his series of bankruptcies was a way to evade the tax authorities…  Yes, losing hundreds of millions by bankrupting freakin’ casinos was actually a genius plan to avoid paying single digit millions of taxes.   I too will use this logic and go buy $10,000 worth of scratch off tickets so that I might win $500 and hope that people recognize my genius tactic for earning $500 in “profit.”",kevihaa,2025-05-05T07:07:24,11

We're dealing with the guy who talks about magnets not working underwater, the guy who bankrupted multiple casinos, the guy who tried to get a reporter to pass off an obviously Photoshopped picture as real news, etc., etc.  The American system treats the rich with kid gloves unless they provoke somebody with even more money.",Chase_the_tank,2025-05-06T22:19:27,1

"I can't remember the details - 1990 era - but Honda was found to send parts across the ocean a couple times to ""wash"" them. That was also reported in the auto press. That was right when Honda started their big push to expand production in the USA.  I was working for the automotive industry myself at the time and saw that happen as well. But it was Lee Iacocca who said it best... ""Our parts are good enough for Rolls Royce and other premium European automakers but not good enough for Isuzu"". American auto parts makers had a devil of a time selling to the Japanese mostly because of the keiretsu system.   I had a USA built Corolla back then, exceptional vehicle but many parts were 2-3 different versions depending on VIN etc. Not fun having to play parts detective.",debugprint,2025-05-05T10:02:17,2
"Other casino owners can be as smart as they want, but they need to first accept the fact that one of them wants to ruin the casino. By the way, this is one of the most famous fraudulent schemes. In Ukraine, there was literally a scheme in the construction business when a company appears, starts building housing, all the documents are there, there is no reason to assume the worst, and then at one point the company's capital is transferred to offshore accounts and the company itself is declared bankrupt. Once again, people need to first believe that Trump is powerful. And this bastard is very good at pretending to be stupid so that he is not considered a fraud.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-05T08:11:11,0
"Keep in mind that you buy lottery tickets from yourself, and pay taxes only on winnings. Do you understand what the problem is? For some reason everyone thinks that Trump is a businessman interested in business and profit from this business. When in fact he is literally a fraud who is only interested in stealing and personal enrichment at the expense of destroying business. The error in your logic is that you assume that you will not draw a lottery ticket yourself and then pretend that you bought it from someone else.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-05T08:06:55,-4
"Well both are true. He’s done all that, or more likely people around him that he’s hired or who are sycophants have for him, and he’s also very stupid.",AJDx14,2025-05-05T06:57:07,4
"I don’t disagree that he’s not as stupid as people think, but I think some of his “intellect” is really just hearing the most advantageous ideas that help him and then facilitating their execution, regardless of the moral, ethical, and sometimes legal, implications.",Impressive_Ad_5614,2025-05-05T08:58:20,3
