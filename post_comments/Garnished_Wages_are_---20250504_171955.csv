"People on r/studentloans are losing their minds.  What I don’t understand is, how are you in default after a 5 years payment pause? And they also offer a rehabilitation program to get out of default. This just sounds like people who ignored the problem until it was too late.",dont-CA-my-TX,2025-05-04T18:59:17,175
">After 270 days, borrowers are put into default, which presents more serious financial consequences such as involuntary collections from their paychecks or difficulty securing future loans.  Mainstream outrage of the day: blowing off a previous loan can prevent people from taking out another loan.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-04T17:35:01,189
"5.3m students are in default right now, pair that with rising prices, bad job market.... something has to be done and it isn't garnishment. They need to root out the source of the problem and fix it, not one administration has tried to fix it. Not Bush. Not Obama. Not Trump and not Biden (dont give me bullshit saying Biden did because he was trying to forgive $10000, we all know thats just slapping a wet bandaid on the problem and not fixing it).  Student loans are a ticking time bomb right now.",Simmumah,2025-05-04T18:38:53,223
"I don't think defaulting on student loans should happen. I'm struggling with mine after many years. When I went school, everyone told me I needed to go to college... if I went to college I'd be okay. These were people I trusted, teachers, parents, friends of my parents.  Just to put that in perspective, a bunch of people told me, a teenager with very little job experience and a proven track record of money mismanagement, should take out loans amounting to about $80k.  I didn't know about interest at the time, at least not that the amount I would pay in interest would be more than the loans them selves. I didn't know how screwy the job market would be when I graduated. I also didn't know myself and how the careers I was going for were easily accessible to me intellectually but my personality did not fit them at all.  I'm not one for student loan forgiveness, we who took out loans need to pay them back, but it would be nice if we could get some kind of help, and especially if that help somehow fucks over the people who designed this predatory system.  The way the government kind of ""helps"" now is by reducing my taxes slightly based on how much interest I paid the bank each year.... this doesn't amount to much at all.",MikeyPh,2025-05-05T04:42:09,21

"Why is no one mad at the colleges and universities about their ridiculous cost escalations over the years? Tuition, fee and book costs increase at a rate far beyond inflation. Student loan amounts would be in a much more manageable range if these upfront costs were anywhere near reasonable.",wanttostaygottogo,2025-05-05T04:35:03,15

What a bunch of absolute losers. Took out loans for half a decade and wanted the fiscally responsible to pay for it through our taxpayers money. I hope they all get taught a lesson and have their wages garnished.,BecauseTheTruthHurts,2025-05-05T09:21:36,1
"I am in support of people who take out student loans having to pay them back, and wage garnishment as an option for it. But it does give me pause on one factor, and that factor is bankruptcy cannot discharge student loan debt.  This system will make it so that you have individuals who are buried in debt, having whatever income they are collecting garnished to pay towards that debt (probably for the rest of their lives) and have no recourse but to be in indentured servitude based on a decision they most likely made at the age of 18.  There has to be a better way to address this problem than that. I will never be for trapping and burying American citizens like this.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-04T20:04:17,235
"Step 1 - Use publicly available data to determine which degrees the US Government wants to invest into (do NOT pay some loser nepo institution millions in ""research"" grants to find the answer, it's already out there""  Step 2 - Only offer loans for those  Step 3 - Offer loan incentives for high grades, offer more incentives to working in hot spot government programs where those diplomas are needed, etc. Roll your 4 year degree into a government job through some other program, yadda yadda.

"Basically, the cost of college has almost tripled even after accounting for inflation since 1990. Combined with stagnant wages, especially the minimum wage part jobs, college students usually take. Well, they even hope to even put a dent in what they'll owe after graduation. The worst offenders public state universities. The Government gave them a blank check with the current  financial aid system, and they're cashing in. I wouldn't say student loans are a ticking bomb. The bomb has already exploded as Millennials, and Gen Z aren't buying homes, can't afford to save for retirement, aren't buying new vehicles, and don't any sort of savings what so ever in most cases.",jmartin251,2025-05-09T23:24:13,1

"18 year olds cant get a mortgage generally speaking, but they can all qualify for tens or even hundreds of thousands in student loan debt.   Plus if there is a default on a house it gets foreclosed and the debt is settled with the sale of the house, and any remaining debt could be discharged in bankruptcy.

"Either 18 year olds are responsible enough to drink alcohol smoke cigarettes and own a handgun, or they aren’t responsible enough to sign for tens of thousands of dollars in unsecured debt. They can’t be both.   Let’s be honest for a moment; 99% of people don’t understand the contracts they enter into because they are intentionally written in an obtuse legalese. Expecting people just barely competent to stand trial to comprehend compound interest is quite literally setting them up to fail.  If I was wrong there wouldn’t be a “student loan debt crisis” to speak of, there would be a few edge cases rather than billions in default.  We haven’t even mentioned the insane prices universities charge in the first place. The supply and demand of course comes into consideration, but there is no lack of supply. The demand exists because the government’s economic policies created a demand for a skilled workforce, while simultaneously flooding the economy with unskilled labor.   Plus, it isn’t like prices are linked exclusively to supply and demand. For example there is a basically unlimited supply of any software title you could imagine, yet some software can cost thousands of dollars. A basically infinite supply and a low demand would indicate a low price, but instead we have artificial scarcity and price points created to extract maximum profit. University is no different.",Bramse-TFK,2025-05-05T17:35:24,3
"I recall there was a giant ""I understand I have to repay this"" clause in plain ol' English early on in the loan process.  Far more loans are repaid than are defaulted.  The vast majority or the blame lies squarely with the borrower, although I admit there are some predatory lenders and ""educational"" institutions out there.  Most of the latter have been addressed, however.  Bottom line, you are responsible for your actions when you are 18 as an adult whether it be murder or taking out a loan.  Regardless, I agree that Loans should be limited to degrees that lead to careers that have the potential to pay them back.  They should also monitor grades and yank the rug out from under those who are not on a track to graduate.  Prices **are** linked to supply and demand. The all to easy to get loans drive up demand, and the universities reacted in kind by raising prices.  That's why tuition grew ~5x the rate of inflation since 1980.",yanman,2025-05-05T19:27:19,1
"When you have a widespread problem, the cause is a systemic issue. If the problem wasn’t widespread then writing off those loans would be a rounding error. We wouldn’t have these discussions.  The point on supply and demand was both being manipulated by the government, this isn’t a natural market. This issue was caused by government, and it should be addressed by government.  While people can certainly understand they have to repay a loan, there is a reason we don’t loan unemployed 18 year olds tens of thousands of dollars. There is no other way an 18 year old gets a hundred grand in unsecured debt aside from government intervention. Again this crisis was created by government and it should be addressed by the government.",Bramse-TFK,2025-05-06T13:58:20,1
It wasn't 100% created by the government.  I place the bulk of the blame on 18 year-olds and others who took out outrageous loans.

"Unless you are a billionaire, then just declare bankruptcy.  Oh wait, you can’t discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy. That is because it is a unique financial product. The government schools spend more than a decade of a child’s formative years telling them they need an advanced degree (because of the government’s economic policy) then creates an entirely new and unique class of unsecured debt to trap them in a lifetime of payments the moment they are an adult (except not adult enough to buy a beer).",Bramse-TFK,2025-05-06T15:16:49,1

"If there is just a few people that have an issue, why is this even news? Im glad you paid off your degree in ten years, the average student loan takes about 20 years to pay off, according to Education Data Initiative and Ramsey Solutions.
