This is absolutely meaningless bullshit from someone who has her tongue so far up Trump's ass she may as well be speaking for him.  She's angling for a Senate seat and wants to make herself look a little more independent.  I highly doubt she even wrote the tweet herself.,RadioGagaLabHead,2025-05-02T19:27:03,50

"MTG is walking on thin ice, her constituents and fidelity the Trump. You can reckon many a Republican are going to face the “between a rock and a hard place”. Granted these austerity measures for the masses will hit everywhere, but red States and rural America will be taking the brunt of the hit.

People act like Trump won the election in an absolute blowout when he got less than 50% of the total vote. He beat Kamala in the popular vote total by 2.3 million votes but Biden beat him by over 7 million and Hillary beat him by almost 3 million.  People take Trump's base to be the vast majority of this country but that's never been the case. There's a growing number of low information voters who voted Trump and are now disillusioned by him 3 months in.,Orange8920,2025-05-02T20:07:44,9
"The maga turds blindly following him i got. I never expected anything else.  But the ones that voted for him or stayed home because they were low information or just saw the Dems as the same? I hold anger for them for having chosen such an obviously bad choice and bringing this on all of us.  Get off your asses and participate in your society, folks!",perenniallandscapist,2025-05-02T20:19:13,2
