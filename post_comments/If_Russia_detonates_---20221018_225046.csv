"If i am not mistaken article 5 isnt invoked somehow, but has to be declared. There is no automatism.",chastema,2022-10-19T13:01:43,30
Weaponizing radioactive fallout would absolutely count as an attack.  It would also be utterly insane.,jpj007,2022-10-19T12:27:27,42
"I don't think there's a specific clause or precedent that would definitively answer this. It certainly COULD count as an attack, but in the right circumstance I suppose NATO could take less drastic action. If it was an accident or if it happened without warning or expectation, then maybe other solutions are tried before military retaliation.   But Putin has been on warned explicitly many, many, many times what the rules are. NATO has exercised a remarkable degree of restraint. If Putin decided intentionally to send nuclear fallout into NATO as a form of escalation, then that's obviously Article 5 worthy and would immediately result in military intervention.",mormagils,2022-10-19T13:15:18,9
"Yes, that would be considered a radiological attack and is defined in several treaties and resolutions as such. It's no different than a dirty bomb.",Volsunga,2022-10-19T16:11:55,9
"Countries need to vote to invoke Article 5, meaning they need to decide if this harm was an attack.  During the Chernobyl disaster, a lot of radiation spread as far west as West Germany. But no one considered invoking Article 5 because it was clear that Chernobyl was not an attack against any NATO country.  The point of NATO is not to retaliate to every source of damage, it's to make sure if anyone does something to a member at the scale of war, they have a community who will defend them. Libya blew up a British flight and NATO did not invoke article 5. Al Qaeda blew up the world trade center and the pentagon and NATO did invoke article 5 for the first and only time.   It's not purely about harm being done, it's a question of ""is this war?"" The US felt after 9/11 that this was war and everyone agreed. Britain did not consider it war when they were attacked. So the key would be ""should we consider the war attacking NATO members directly or is this not a direct attack on us?""",auandi,2022-10-19T17:42:15,7
This isn't really a political question. It's insane. What the hell is up with this sub lately.,CaitlinHuxley,2022-10-19T19:32:12,2
>to flow with the wind sending it over to mainland Europe?  Wind flows from west to east. That wouldnt even work.,BigHairyDingo,2022-10-19T17:24:08,-4
It would be idiotic….they’d be irradiating themselves more than anyone else.  The prevalent wind direction in Russia is west to east… I don’t think they’d get the outcome they’d want.,fataljester63,2022-10-19T21:19:08,1
NATO nations and the Head of NATO forced in Europe has already specifically said it would.,[deleted],2022-11-03T22:01:54,1
This is the correct answer.  The issue here is intention. The intention of the nuclear detonation is to do harm indirectly to other countries. That would be a violation. The charter would then have to be invoked by NATO.   It's also utterly insane.,Yggdrssil0018,2022-10-19T16:05:42,19
"In 1986 when Chernobyl exploded in Soviet occupied Ukraine the radioactive cloud emanating from the reactor actually did reach the UK with a few toxic showers in Scotland/Wales in the 10 days it was burning. Belarus getting the brunt of the exposure all without any alert from the soviet union.  Swedish nuclear engineers getting inexplicable radiation signals from workers entering the site then alerting the european community was the only reason the USSR even admitted to a disaster that put countless lives in danger. No war declaration was even considered at the time, obviously this was an inadvertent disaster but at the time the soviet posturing and invasion was almost just as bad as Putin's empire today.  Not to mention the control that modern contained nuclear weapons can offer and how rapid full on escalation can occur... Is the west really prepared to declare world war 3 over radiation?",ohimjustakid,2022-10-20T22:00:06,1
What? No it falls under the scope of the sub: NATO Art 5 procedures are a valid question to ask since it’s a political decision.,dunpyklungo,2022-10-20T06:03:38,3
I'm sorry. I don't know what subreddit I should've posted this on.,MindCologne,2022-10-20T04:40:24,2
Except during Chernobyl when the wind was blowing towards the north west.,Polarion,2022-10-19T17:45:11,1
