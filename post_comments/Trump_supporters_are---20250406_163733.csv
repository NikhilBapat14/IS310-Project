Wouldn't it have been really helpful if his opponent would have been a very polished attorney, District Attorney/Prosecutor, Senator, and former Vice-President, and she had laid out for you, in great detail, what was going to happen? That would have been a big help to you, right?   But, you didn't hear anything from them! It was almost like they colluded against you.  If only there was some way for you to know that this was coming, some type of, I don't know, video, internet post, discussions, or family members who didn't think that voting for Trump was a good idea.   If literally anyone had reached out to you and told you this was going to happen, then maybe you could have voted to not have this happen.  But how could you have known? You never listened to a thing from them.  The world was silent about his intentions, he clearly never said anything about doing this on national TV, and he told us all that his opponent was a DEI hire who slept her way through, what was it, the highest elected positions in the United States? The news outlets ran non-stop negative stories about her and promoted him as the savior of America, didn't they?   How could you have known? How could you even remotely consider anyone who has a different view than you do?   I guess when you voted for the candidate that was going to hurt all the non-white and poor people, you didn't think you were going to be counted among them.   But hey, I get it. It isn't like there was an entire war fought within the last 80 years that started exactly like this Presidential term did.

"Exactly! This is what happens when a bunch of uneducated racists are in charge. All of the things they are cutting are things that according to stereotypes should be hurting ‚Äúother non-white or non-conservative folk‚Äù For example- when people think of Head Start, free lunch programs, and ‚Äúwelfare‚Äùmost of them think getting rid of that hurts inner city black and brown folks. When in reality those schools are actually short-changed and have to seek corporate sponsors and do more with less, so while losing federal funding hurts,these schools weren‚Äôt getting a fair portion to begin with. But rural communities were and losing that funding is going to be way more devastating in those communities.  Farmers are another. You don‚Äôt hear many Black farmers complaining because they weren‚Äôt getting those subsidies and have had to figure out how to thrive without them.
