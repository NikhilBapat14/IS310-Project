"THIS is why a conventional invasion of the US will never happen. Too expensive, too costly, too much loss of invading personnel (if they even survive our naval defensive and missile onslaught), and waaaaaaay too big in geographical size to be able to hold anything they do manage to survive taking, while dealing with a trained and armed populace giving them hell and thinning their numbers every day.",ITrCool,2025-05-02T21:30:09,5

"Also we have the most gizmos.  Any enemy vehicle landing on our shores would have flying beehives going into its hatches the second they try to dismount, it's not a prediction this is roughly how 2010s-era vehicular combat is countered in the mid 2020s.  Some redneck with a perimeter of piss jugs around his trailer would be waging his own electronic warfare from his yard, there would be ambushes and trip traps all over the path to his trailer, and there would be an effectively unlimited supply of people like him so going after one is a fool's errand. Enemy countries won't be able to figure out the logistics around here, we barely figure it out ourselves.  ""When is the American insurgency going to end?"" ""That's not an insurgency that's just America.""  Americans put a row of empty bean cans in front of a tank to get the commander out of his hatch, then smallarm the commander.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-02T21:45:57,2
"Amusing as it is, Red Dawn is a total fantasy in an alternate world that will never happen.",ITrCool,2025-05-02T22:08:52,1
