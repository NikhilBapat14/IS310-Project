“An understanding” is another way RFK jr lets us know he’s been neutered by corporate boards and has no ability or is unwilling to actually do shit about shit,howcanibehuman,2025-05-01T16:01:52,64
You can’t have no regulation or oversight and ban a food additive on the honor system lol,Kytyngurl2,2025-05-01T16:14:14,15
Yeah Dyes is the problem right. Not basic understanding and legit information but the dyes guys. Sarcasm. Tm.,ValkyrieITGuy,2025-05-01T16:10:26,11
watch it be something like: they can omit food dyes from the ingredient list while still using them,box-cable,2025-05-01T15:58:22,7
"TLDR:  * [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://people.com/rfk-jr-confirmed-health-secretary-9344760) Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://people.com/tag/robert-kennedy-jr/) and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary announced on April 21 plans to ban artificial food dyes, citing them as part of an ongoing system that, as Kennedy has said in the past, has been allowed to [“mass poison”](https://people.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-plans-to-ban-synthetic-food-dyes-11719857) children. * ""We are going to get rid of the dyes,"" Kennedy said, per [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372637/food-dyes-ban-fda-rfk-kennedy), as Makary said they were a part of ""a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals."" Kennedy claimed, ""the industry has voluntarily agreed.""  He said he had reached “an understanding” with food manufacturers to stop using petroleum-based food colorings by 2026.  * The only problem with the announcement? “There was no ban,” dietician [Dr. Jessica Knurick](https://www.instagram.com/drjessicaknurick/?hl=en) tells PEOPLE. “There was no regulatory action done. They basically asked the food industry to stop using these artificial food dyes, and then came out with this announcement that there had been this agreement — and the food industry promptly came out and said there was no agreement.”",peoplemagazine,2025-05-01T15:56:10,12

I agree with it but dismantling the FDA and food safety standards and regulations don’t convince me of its practicality; they are literally allowing salmonella and listeria in meat and food products without much scrutiny.,Environmental_Jump79,2025-05-01T16:15:03,4
"All these MAGA morons are complete head-cases.  RFK at least has a brain parasite infestation that he can blame, as well as years of heavy-duty drug abuse.   What is amazing about these idiots is that they are convinced that they can just bullshit any absurd lie that pops into their worm-gnawed brain and think no one will ever check or remember their bullshit lie.   Obviously, ""manufacturers"" have not suddenly agreed to stop using ""dyes"" in food processing.  But somehow, RFK thinks he can just bullshit every one like some teenager thinking that everyone is totally buying his bullshit story about a ""girlfriend"" in Canada.   Nothing MAGA minions say should be believed.  If they ever tell the truth about anything, it was completely unintentional.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-01T16:30:16,2

"> Except—“There was no regulatory action done. They basically asked the food industry to stop using these artificial food dyes, and then came out with this announcement that there had been this agreement — and **the food industry promptly came out and said there was no agreement**.”  With no regulatory oversight to prove they quit using dyes, they will likely do something trumpian like change the name from 'Red dye #5"" to 'Quintuple rose tincture' and their idiot followers will scream their praises.",brithus,2025-05-01T18:33:17,2

California has already banned a couple of the dyes in general food products to take effect in 2027 and many of the food dyes he has banned are to be banned in California school systems also taking effect in 2027. This will be a defacto ban on the food dyes because they won't have two different manufacturing lines for Cali and the rest of the states because Cali is such a large consumer base. They are trying to get ahead of the ban Cali has so they can claim victory and say they did it rather than cali leading the way.,NolanSyKinsley,2025-05-02T01:37:22,1

You can't ban it when you crippled the regulators. Why are people so stupid? ,Youcantshakeme,2025-05-01T19:44:48,10
"I mean even attempting a more stringent approach to the USA’s food regulations is great. Saying that there’s an understanding with the administration and corporations is something I don’t believe. That costs money, probably a lot of it, to change dyes to something safer. And I doubt it will happen.  The sad thing is changing dyes even if it happens is a grandma’s kiss on a bullet wound. It doesn’t fix much although I helps ever so slightly. To do anything meaningful to fix food regulations will be a stretch.  This is one thing I’ll tip my hat to the wyrmskull on.",RelevantNothing2692,2025-05-01T17:40:06,4
"Well that's because they are too busy banning vaccines and help for trans kids.  I mean if you could devote your energies to making real positive change and impact or you could devote yourself to pseudoscience and corporate profits, wouldn't the choice be obvious?

"And that's the problem.  The actual results are buried down in the third bullet point which most people either won't read or remember.  What I've really noticed lately is that Trump or one of his cabinet cronies announces they'll be ""investigating"" or ""changing"" something and poeple online react as if it's just happened effective immediately.  None of these Executive Orders are binding to people not in the executive branch, no one's actually making new laws or regulations, they're just having photo-ops and social media grifts.",portlandobserver,2025-05-02T01:58:59,1

Epic argument from a mental TITAN.   Let's say the government bans a dye.    Who will enforce this? Who will inspect factories to make sure it isn't being added? Who will collect samples being sold to test them for those ingredients?    Businesses will regulate themselves right?    Losers,Youcantshakeme,2025-05-01T19:55:27,5
Personally as wild as that nepo baby is I think it speaks to how much he cares about PNW hippie ideals. I truly do believe he tried to get this done and was undermined by his superiors that only look out of uncle end-stage capitalism.  He’s said some batshit stuff while in his role but I don’t think he’s lying about trying to get this one done. I’ve had a lot of time at work to understand who this human is through podcasts and he does a lot of them.   He undoubtedly was added as a face of the administration because of his social media presence and a draw it has with health conspiracies enjoyers. After the election he’s just a useful idiot and I doubt much of any of his policy’s he’d like to implement are going to pass. (Mostly for the better),RelevantNothing2692,2025-05-01T17:53:06,0

That's the whole point.  He didn't ban anything.  He apparently lied about having an agreement with the food industry.  This is instead of actually banning anything.,JojenCopyPaste,2025-05-01T18:53:48,5

"where did he say he banned food dyes? the quote i saw said “we are getting rid of food dyes,” not that he had already banned them. and the FDA released a statement:  >On April 22, the FDA appeared to soften these initial declarations, releasing a statement saying it was going to “initiate the process” to “revoke authorization” for citrus red #2, and orange B, and ""phase out"" ""petroleum-based synthetic dyes."" But, Dr. Knurick says, tcitrus red #2, and orange B are dyes that “we don't really use anymore,” with the exception of one sometimes being used in orange peels.   so they’re obviously doing something. i’m as liberal as they come, check my comment history. but this is textbook manufactured outrage",drthvdrsfthr,2025-05-01T21:17:20,-5
