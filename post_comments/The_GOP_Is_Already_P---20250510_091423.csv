It also makes the economy more productive because you have less of the workforce tied up in useless and unproductive jobs like the secret police or prison guards of political prisoners.

This one will introduce you to founding of the modern day republican party, how it became what it is, and why they're deadset on rigging elections so they can rule the US.   Next up, read [Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833494-dark-money).

"> just hand picking a candidate with no say from the people, like the Democrats pulled in 2024  After nearly 14 million voters participated in the 2024 primary and chose Biden to continue as the Democratic nominee, the media, celebrities, and even some Democratic leaders decided that political astrology (aka polls) was the more worthy to listen to (like that Iowa poll claiming Harris would have won, what a joke).  Even Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sided with the voters, saying: ""Mr. Biden will be the candidate and should be the candidate. It’s time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking.""  Despite countless polls claiming Biden’s age was a concern and showing Harris as a frontrunner, the majority of voters ignored those predictions and chose the older candidate, anyway.

"Yeah, Lieberman (the Fiscal Conservative Independent) and the 4 moderate Dems, Nelson, Baucus and the other 2, I forgot those bums’ names. They all knew Obama needed 60 votes to get the ACA through, and effectively downgraded it. Some with Biden’s BBB with Manchin and Sinema. Stop electing people like that. Your state just did. But you know why I give Dems the benefit of doubt? Because a majority of them DID vote for the public option, in fact, without the filibuster, we’d have a public option right now. You know who I don’t give the benefit of doubt to? The Republicans. The party who NEVER votes for actual progressive legislation. Yet this country continues to elect them.",ViolentObama,2025-05-10T12:30:08,1
"Dems are controlled opposition, in the same way that Republicans are. Ever notice there's like 1 or 2 Republicans who vote yes when like 99% of them vote no? They allow them to vote no because they're in a little state or whatever, some political bullshit. Same thing for Dems,  but its just the opposite. 99% yes but 1% no.   Controlled position. Oligarchs pay for elections, and expect results. They get them, and we're fooled into thinking there's a good and a bad team. But they're all funded by the same industries.",aintnochallahbackgrl,2025-05-10T12:33:11,1
"So the majority of Dems who voted for the public option and that voted for BBB in Senate are controlled opposition? I’m sure all of their donors would’ve been thrilled to see Government Funded Healthcare and Free Community College. They would’ve loved that. Also your hypothesis doesn’t correlate with ACA or BBB, since 0 Republicans voted for it. If even 2 Republicans voted for BBB in 2021, we’d be in a completely different country right now.",ViolentObama,2025-05-10T12:40:45,1
"On one hand, I'm impressed by your fortitude in arguing the point assertively and calmly. On the other, I can't stop thinking that you're just not gonna reason the guy our of a position he so clearly didn't reason himself into.  Then again, there's gonna be people reading this thread, nevermind, please keep doing what you're doing.",Mornar,2025-05-10T13:13:14,1

"It okay to disagree with my positions like the other commenter. Just know, that I’ll have a rebuttal more often than not. I don’t want to sound like a shill for the DNC, but to blame them collectively for America’s missteps or lack of progress would be completely ignoring how the other half of congress make little to no effort to pass progressive legislation, and their base just allows it. If even half of the Dems in congress voted the way people describe them, I’d see their point. But that’s not even true. A vast majority of Dems voted for a public option IN 2008!   When it comes to electoral politics in Congress. It’s simple with me, respect the base and have a good voting record. I don’t care about donors or culture war nonsense.",ViolentObama,2025-05-10T14:40:33,1
