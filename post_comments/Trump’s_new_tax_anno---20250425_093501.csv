Him destroying the economy is not the win for Democrats you might think it is.  His jackass followers wont put 2 and 2 together and realize he caused their financial problems.,Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T09:56:47,7
"A gift to the Democrats? The Democrats?    Fuck you MSNBC. ""The Democrats"" aren't a fucking thing until we see Trump leave office without installing some type of fascist state.    FBI is arresting judges at this point.",TsarOfTheUnderground,2025-04-25T10:04:51,19

"**From James Downie, writer and editor for MSNBC Daily:**  After President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday that he opposed increasing taxes on the rich to pay for the rest of his policy agenda, Democrats could breathe a sigh of relief. The idea would be “very disruptive,” Trump said, echoing House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who told Fox News earlier that day, “I’m not in favor of raising the tax rates because our party is the group that stands against that traditionally.”  Taxing the rich is a policy typically associated with Democrats. Since most voters think the wealthy don’t pay enough in taxes, that works to the party’s advantage. But Washington’s highest-ranking Republicans were reportedly increasingly comfortable with the notion, as well.

Which is wild because most maga insist the fbi either works for 'the deep state' or 'the democrats'.,EvaUnit_03,2025-04-25T20:00:31,2
Republican president is against raising taxes on millionaires.  Democrats breathe a sign of relief.  WTF? Am in the upside down? Utter bullshit. That’s like saying..  Democratic President is for legislation to combat climate change.  Republicans breathe a sigh of relief.  This article is a bunch of cynical beltway twaddle. ,Zealousideal_Ad_9623,2025-04-25T09:45:11,10
"Why should democrats breathe a sigh of relief because the rich aren't being taxed? Personally I don't care which party does it, I just want it done. Don't get me wrong, I had no confidence that Republicans would entertain the idea. In fact, they're going to de-facto cut taxes on the rich with their extension of the Trump Tax Cuts.  As for Democrats, they might talk about it or run on it but there will always be an excuse why they can't do it. We are still waiting on a $15 minimum wage—which was inadequate at the time—which now needs to be \~$19 just to equal what it was at the time it was proposed after years of high inflation. Sigh.",-CJF-,2025-04-25T09:43:55,3
