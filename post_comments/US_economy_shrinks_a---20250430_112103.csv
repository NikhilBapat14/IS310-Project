Some people say that Trump will take us into another Great Depression.  They‘re wrong.  It’ll be the Greatest Depression.,Cephalopod_astronaut,2025-04-30T11:24:44,29
"Im poor but luckily am living with my family right now while i finish my degree, so I don't have to pay rent for the moment. I have spent everything i could afford on extra food- i have been hoarding it under the guest bed. Everytime i shove another boxful of food under the bed it lessens my anxiety. And I know i can share if need be. We all need to circle the wagons and shore up what we can and be prepared to help our neighbors if need be. Unless they are MAGA. Them bitches can find their own food. They caused it, they are the ones always screaming about how Obama was coming for their guns and babies, they can crawl into their own bunkers if they want.",outinthecountry66,2025-04-30T11:28:11,9
Trump Slump will equal empty shelves & unaffordable groceries.  The silence from Congress is deafening.  Many of these donothing Congressional Members may well face trial within the next decade.,Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-30T11:32:35,6
Feels like we're on the initial downslope we won't economically recover from.,jayfeather31,2025-04-30T11:34:06,4
Yet America voted for Trump because of eggs or something?,Phizza921,2025-04-30T11:27:41,2
"The chicken vanguard is coming home to roost.  This but a small taste of what is coming when the main host of tariff chickens arrive to despoil the economy.   Here is one optimistic scenario of how it could play out:    Trump's poll numbers will collapse when the category 20 hurricane of tariff hurt hits. Republicans in the house and senate will distance themselves from the deeply unpopular Trump because he will be a serious election liability.   Republicans fearing a midterm-blowout will start looking for medical reasons to remove Trump. Talk of dementia will get serious. Musk will get booted out of the White House. Billionaires will demand that someone “professional” be put I charge of the economy.   Trump will look increasingly weak, pathetic, and tired--not a good look for “strong man” dictator. Vance will become a despised, ineffectual care-taker when Trump is led out the door. In-fighting will destroy the White House as aides fight like orcs over the crumbs of Trump's discredited and failed Second Reich.  A whimper, not a bang...",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T11:41:56,2

Trump just issued a new executive order renaming the DOW to the DOWN.,This_Is_A_Shitshow,2025-04-30T11:30:00,1
"I'm in this weird position where the well-programmed people around me are saying this isn't going to be a big deal and that it's going to bring jobs back in the long run.    I know that they're wrong.  I even want them to be wrong.  But I don't like that I'm right, either.    I hate what's happening to this country so much that I'm rooting for a consequence that would be bad for all of us.  I don't like to be irrational, but here we are.",Searchlights,2025-04-30T11:36:18,1

"Am I the only one that remembers empty shelves and food lines from the first time Trump MAGA'd? The man is a curse, and memories are short.",StrangeContest4,2025-04-30T11:43:02,4
Politicians are reactive and not proactive. The tariffs haven't fully hit yet. Once the hammer falls you'll see politicians circling Trump like sharks.   If I were a GOP politician Trump failing miserably is my only way to cut Trump from my constituents. So long as Trump has sole control of MAGA they're powerless. So I let the hammer fall first then I go for the jugular and throw Trump under the bus.  Politically expedient but economically catastrophic.,Gracchus0289,2025-04-30T12:22:13,3
"Look, if something bad is about to happen then you should want to believe that something bad is going to happen. Believing a true thing is not the same as wanting it.   When you hold to beliefs despite evidence, well… you get bullshit like MAGA",sylbug,2025-04-30T12:08:59,3
"They’ll feel the pain soon enough. We all will. And many will hopefully begin to deprogram, and with it there will be no told-you-sos from me. But there also won’t be a shoulder to cry on. ",Myrtle_Nut,2025-04-30T11:39:29,1
Grown men will cry at how bigly this is.,NoReserve7293,2025-04-30T12:26:24,6
But economic catastrophe is not going to harm our politicians.  Of course.  Gucci comment - 10/10.,Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-30T13:00:01,1
