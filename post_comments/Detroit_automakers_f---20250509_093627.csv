"If only there had been a warning to folks that Trump was a dangerous moron who betrays everyone and whose word means nothing. Oh, wait…",ParadeSit,2025-05-09T09:39:36,150
"From the article:  *A lobby group representing General Motors, Ford and Stellantis attacked Trump for prioritizing a deal with the U.K. over the two largest U.S. trading partners on the country’s doorstep. “Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a U.K. vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts,” they said.  Detroit’s three automakers blasted the White House for throwing the U.S. car industry under the proverbial bus with his U.K. trade deal.*  He can't even make a deal.",jakktrent,2025-05-09T09:38:00,91
That's actually really funny. In a sick joke kind of way.  It completely undermines his own actions by doing this...  But I am sure that will not even register to his supporters because he will continually tell them that he makes the best deals and they will never fact check a damn thing.,ImmoKnight,2025-05-09T09:44:45,43

"Friendly reminder that Trump loudly said “what idiot signed this thing” in regards to his own trade deal like 6 years after he signed it.

I work at an auto assembly plant and my supervisor kept telling me how we would get more hours as soon as Trump was in office. We’ve since cut an entire shift and we’re down to four days a week. He doesn’t wanna talk about it anymore now.,Impure_guava,2025-05-09T16:11:33,6

"Fwiw, this complaint is an example is why it took decades for the USA to build out all of its free trade deals to the point where we had gotten into a space where tariffs were minimal or nonexistent. (before Trump blew that all up.)  There are dozens of rather powerful interest groups representing industry, labor, consumers, environment, etc. both domestic and abroad that have a stake in these trade deals. A couple of bad terms can turn any one of interest groups into a thorn that is opposing an administration.   Therefore past administrations took negotiations seriously and tried working with and shepherding all stakeholder parties into a direction that enabled freer, flatter trade.  Given though Trump's complete hold over the Republican party; it's doubtful that automakers will have much leverage to change this.",Koelsch,2025-05-09T12:02:27,4

"they didn't need a trade deal to make that happen. anyone who is looking for a Mini, Jaguar or Aston Martin is not buying a ford or GM pickup truck. I suppose Land Rover has some crossover with American vehicles.  not to mention that two of those ""Detroit Automakers"" have been in the UK market for years, though with very few American imports because no one wants loud, heavy, big vehicles that get 5 miles to the gallon. Ford used to have market leading vehicles in most segments here. Some still are, like the Ford Transit.",bbbbbbbbbblah,2025-05-09T16:08:19,2

I am going to just put this out there..  Trump doesn't know what the fuck he is doing.   But he doesn't have to either - he is a reality TV character.  You can say that Tariffs are the exact opposite of lowering prices.   But he can go on TV and tell his drones that he lowered prices as they go to the store and spend more.  His actions do not need to be tied to any measurable results.   He will tell his drones that he did what he set out to do regardless of reality.,JDogg126,2025-05-09T12:19:52,7
