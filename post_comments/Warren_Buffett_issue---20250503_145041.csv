"""Trade should not be a weapon,"" Buffett said. He added that tariffs had ""led to bad things.""  It's true. The next step after trade wars is actual war.",TLakes,2025-05-03T15:20:44,77
Trump needs a war as an excuse to deport every Hispanic person in America.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-03T15:33:42,15
"Yeah but what does buffet know about business anyway? After all, trump is the true ‘master of the deal’, right?",Mindless_Can3631,2025-05-04T07:15:14,3
Did we learn *anything* from the Phantom Menace?,RCP90sKid,2025-05-03T15:37:04,44
"Hence the preparation for using military intervention in Mexico. They're gonna say it's against gang-operations, but it's just pretext for occupation.   But the ghouls that are making these decisions are the most socially inept folks' you'll find in Washington. Their racism supersedes their tactical decision making. That and Trump will give inept orders on the basis of his staff needing to ass-kissing.",watcherofworld,2025-05-03T15:36:57,15
"He can call off elections if we’re at war, and keep himself in power longer. Martial law would also give him more power.",Impressive_Water659,2025-05-03T16:07:57,13

"A quick google is enough to tell you that the president doesn’t have the power to cancel or postpone elections. They might change the law, but theyd have t act quickly as it’s difficult to imagine the gop retaining majorities in the house and senate after the midterms.",Mindless_Can3631,2025-05-04T07:17:19,2

I can't believe we got a downgrade from Jar Jar....,MockDeath,2025-05-03T20:26:14,8
"Congress has the power to postpone elections indefinitely. And just because the USA hasn’t pulled all the Russian oligarchy cards yet, doesn’t mean we’re not headed that way. Clearly Trump has no regards for the constitution and nobody is holding him accountable",Impressive_Water659,2025-05-04T10:58:50,2
