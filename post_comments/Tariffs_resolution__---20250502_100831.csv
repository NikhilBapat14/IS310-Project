"The fact that the  vote was this close is hopefully an indication that a split in the party is underway. There have to be a few republicans with a spine, right?",AllynCrane,2025-05-02T10:25:27,30

Why Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse was absent from the voting? People from Rhode Island should ask their Junior Senator why he allowed this tie.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-05-02T12:47:11,8
"because he was in South Korea having talks concerning trade, which is pretty fucking important right now with allies turning to China because of Trump's crazy ass.  he's a member of the Foreign Affairs and Fiance committees in the senate.   so, should he not do his job? what do yall want here? should he fly back in a F-35 to cast his vote and then F-35 back to South Korea? for a bill trump would instantly veto when it hit his desk?  mitch McConnell wasn't there either, so it really didn't matter whitehouse wasn't there, because Republicans would have just shelved the vote if whitehouse showed and McConnell didn't.   please folks, learn how your government works. don't embarrass yourself on the internet.",unfinishedtoast3,2025-05-02T13:22:24,7
You are the only one here embarrasing yourself. There are plenty of days to have a meeting with South Korea. He should have voted period. The reason why he was in South Korea and not in the Senate is something he has to explain.   Of course everybody is turning to China. That is the great Trump killing relationships with Our allies. Do you really think Whitehouse is going to change anyone's opinion in South Korea or anywhere in the world when POTUS is making fun of every country in twitter everyday.??,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-05-02T13:33:31,1
"South Korean diplomats have more important shit to care about than Trump shitposting. Senate already voted on 1 tarrif bill and it died in the House. If somehow enough House Republicans buck Mike Johnson to force a vote and pass it, Trump instantly vetos it. Sheldon Whitehouse's vote was not make or break for this legislation.",Dry_Extension1110,2025-05-02T13:48:28,2
Whitehouse vote was to place 50 to 49. We have to do Our part. Trump will veto everything but if We don't do the little things We will not move forward. BTW not only South Korea diplomats but in the vast majority of countries now a days politicians talk abput Trump comments all the time.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-05-02T14:09:10,2
"Voting on legislation that is 100% going to lose after already voting in a similar bill isn't moving anything forward.  We already know which Republicans will vote for tarrifs and who won't. And yes SKs follow Trump comment but I don't think they care about his shitposts, they care about actual policy and administrative actions which hopefully Whitehouse got some productive work done with them. I'd rather have Democratic Senators going abroad to maintain our foreign relationships best they can versus messaging votes on legislation that won't pass. ",Dry_Extension1110,2025-05-02T14:14:27,2
