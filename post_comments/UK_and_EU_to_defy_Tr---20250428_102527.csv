"Trump’s tariffs aren’t just hitting China, they’re isolating America from allies too. Now the UK and EU are literally drafting trade deals to work around him.  That’s the real cost of “America First” when it turns into “America Alone.”",fulltrendypro,2025-04-28T10:26:17,36

Wow semi soft brexit.  And Trump made this ?,nobackup42,2025-04-28T11:15:34,1
…. Didn’t the UK have tariffs on the USA first? Like sure the USA tariffs are heavy handed but aren’t they paused for now anyways? How can they promote themselves as free trade supporters when this USA administrations excuses for the tariffs are that they were being terrifed first?,Sol-Firebird,2025-04-28T17:28:32,1
"The tariffs are the least of it though.  The USA government keep threatening to annex (read: invade) Canada and Greenland, tried to sell out Ukraine to Russia and is openly hostile towards the EU and democracy in general. America is already alone.",barryvm,2025-04-28T10:29:58,18
"They might not even be allies anymore. France had to send a nuclear sub off the East Coast because of our threats to Canada and macron refused to even shake Trump's hand at the Pope's funeral.  He has isolated us from our allies, the only question is if we can fix the relationship or if it is already lost for decades at a minimum.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-28T10:29:47,9
I wouldn't call Reform politicians. They are a far right MAGA 2.0 UK wannabes.,Lmjones1uj,2025-04-28T10:45:21,7
The tories and reform that just suffered a historic loss? Lol,pastilla889,2025-04-28T12:14:28,3
"What do you expect? These people are everywhere. They might not be as far along the same road, but those ""populist"" and ""anti-immigration"" parties across Europe are just the same old proto-fascists they always were, and most of the so-called moderate right is as willing as ever to make common cause with them if that means they can keep pushing their pet socioeconomic policies.  Some countries, like the UK, are especially vulnerable to this because you essentially get absolute power based on a plurality of the vote, whereas in most other countries you need to set up some kind of coalition and power sharing arrangement.",barryvm,2025-04-28T10:43:32,1
"I'm from the UK. We don't want tonleave ECoHR, Reform do.   We have a labour Government so we will not be doing anything of the sort for at least 4yrs.",Lmjones1uj,2025-04-28T10:46:44,3
probably lost since the world doesnt trust the united states anymore,saiyanscaris,2025-04-28T17:14:14,3
"I get what you're trying to say, but I would say that before thinking about fixing any international relationships, you need to fix your country. At the present time things are looking extremely dire from the other side of the Atlantic, with the executive branch arresting judges and the shadow of a police state looming, on top of continuing threats to the sovereignty of some of our allies, which many Americans seem to be able to dismiss easily. Be sure that we do not. I find it interesting that people here are still questioning if some countries are still the US' allies, when a huge portion of the Canadian population, for one, has been considering the US not just as ""no longer an ally"", but as an *enemy* for a while now. And we're talking about freaking Canadians here.  And it's going to get much worse before (if?) it gets better. Trump is sounding more and more like a dictator every day. This is not the kind of country the EU and UK could -- or should -- trust. Your country is so far removed from what it was mere months ago that it seems it may be too much for Americans to take in, being in the middle of it. It's possible you lack perspective",Acrobatic-Stoat,2025-04-28T21:00:23,2
Remember the BNP? Same people different party.,Sinocatk,2025-04-28T11:38:41,1
"I was saying that we need to fix our country first, and that's why it would take decades. Say republicans get crushed in midterms, and Trump loses emphatically in 4 years.  We are still a country that within as soon as four years could turn around and backstab all of our allies again. Even if we rid ourselves of Trump tomorrow europe, the five eyes, Mexico, etc will not be able to trust us for a long time to come.  You are spot on about how it's too much for Americans to take in. Many Americans live extremely americentric lives and have never heard any media that's not American or talk to anyone who is not american. They absolutely do not understand that the post war world we have spent our entire lives in, has been changed forever.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-28T21:09:41,2
And UKIP... ,Lmjones1uj,2025-04-28T14:06:40,1
"Thank you for your thoughtful response. We're clearly on the same page. I do hope it gets better for the US, sooner rather than later. We don't trust you now, we don't trust your government or the people who voted for it, but I for one am still rooting for you underneath it all. I know there are good people in the US. I really feel for them",Acrobatic-Stoat,2025-04-28T21:17:46,2
