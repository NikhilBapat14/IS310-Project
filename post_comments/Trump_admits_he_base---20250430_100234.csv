"This is weird: the author of this Daily Dot piece writes that ""At the time, critics of Trump suggested that the president genuinely believed MS-13 had been tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, even though it was merely meant to be an interpretation of symbols that were actually on Abrego Garcia’s hand.""  Sorry but how was this ""merely meant to be an interpretation of symbols that were actually on"" AG's hand? Since when does an S mean the happy face, the 1 equal a cross, and the 3 equal a skull?? It sounds like this writer is really reaching, trying to find some explanation (other than sheer f\*ckery to deceive) for why the term MS13 appears on this image at all.  Edit to add: It's hard to believe that Trump actually believes his claim about this tattoo... He's just dug himself into a lie, as with 2020 election claims, and refuses to back out of it.",Bikin4Balance,2025-04-30T19:16:07,2

""Surely he doesn't actually..."". If they were wrong, they'd be fired on the spot. This is why Trump is so baffled by the interviewer, no one has dared raise the possibility that he has misunderstood anything in the photo.      Reminds me of the guards too afraid to check in on Stalin when he had a heart attack.      This also explains why they are blatantly refusing the court's orders. Trump has presumably been outraged that the court would ask him to return a man with tattoos clearly showing he is a terrorist. So now the entire trump administration has been working to satisfy the president's will to keep him out of the country. Because they don't question the president. And the few people that were there when Trump saw that picture? Well they are probably hoping Trump forgets thelat they were.   What's crazy is that this might be a huge factor in the administration's disobedience towards the courts. Trump would undoubtedly view the courts as completely unreasonable for saying there is no evidence he is in MS13. I could see how that would convince him that he needs to ""take matters into his own hands"". I wonder if we will see a reversal soon (and many firings from the white house), or will they double down? I often suspect that Trump is more honest than the system he has built. This is a rare moment where he will be able to see clear as day that that system has lied to him and resulted in a great wronging. On the other hand, that would be very hard to accept. He could always just shift to believing the symbols mean those numbers. ",Spanktank35,2025-04-30T18:06:19,2

">  I watch Fox News because my political take is different than yours and based in fact.  No. I assume you watch Fox news because your points are exactly the same as the ones that Fox News uses, and are debunked by the same 15 seconds of google searching or critical thought. Everyone is aware that you think anything they say is factual, because Fox News says it is, but it isn't.   If you could debunk or refute anything I said, you would have done it.

"That's what patriotic leaders would do, too bad you'll find exactly zero of those in the Republican party...

"Yeah, that’s definitely their MO. So now the whole country is held hostage by dimwits. It’s a requiem for a once great nation, now run by a minority of privileged fools— people living in a trailer in Tennessee somewhere crying about their rights being trampled on and the wealthy, who always seem to get wealthier no matter what happens.

"I'd rather deal with his lazy, incompetence than the crew currently behind him, continuing to use his draw or swapping him out.   Interestingly, I'd bet that MAGA civil war would erupt if they try to replace His Randomness with a Vance or Speaker Johnson, though.   Not to unequivocally predict either a crack down on MAGA by P2025 officials or a pro Trump ""counter coup"" to prevent his Article 25 ouster, but that could be interesting.   Conflict and disunity within the GOP and administration could be the best brake on this downward spiral until/if we get a chance to vote in a majority of Dems in both houses (hopefully a lot of them progressive.)  Unironically, a politically isolated Trump pissed off at both the rich and P2025 elements is likely to ride populism hard, maybe agreeing to Medicaid For All for the public support.",John-A,2025-05-01T01:32:21,1

"> This one is just ""this fake thing you see in front of you is actually real"".  To me Trump has done this COUNTLESS times by OBVIOUS lies about things *he is on record* saying/doing. Pretty much the quintessential use of Fake News. Republicans such as JD Vance and Lindsey Graham are also directly guilty of the same, completely flip flopping their *recorded* stance and statements on something. I was shocked how vehement Vance once was in his hatred of Trump and how much he kissed the brown ring later.",RJ815,2025-04-30T17:39:31,2
