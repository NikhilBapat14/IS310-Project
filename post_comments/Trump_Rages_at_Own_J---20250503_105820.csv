"It's might sound crazy, but I think he doesn't actually understand what the american experiment in self-determination is all about.  It's like he never even bothered to read the list of GRIEVANCES that the american colonies had against England that justified the declaration of independence.  Literally the reason we declared independence from England was because of taxation without representation (his fucking tariffs are a tax with no representation), violations of colonial rights (we are having US citizens snatched off the fucking streets, women can't choose what happens to their own bodies, judges getting snatched, reporters labeled enemies of the state), and perceived abuses of power (he is authorizing raids on american homes, destablizing our economy, ignoring our representatives in congress, ignoring our courts) by the British government.  He doesn't realize that he IS the problem.  As are the people who think what he is doing is okay.  The list of unethical, unconstitutional, immortal, and illegal things that this turd and his thugs have done in the first 100 days is too long to list.  They are intentionally abusing power excessively to flood the lanes and paralyze the courts and congress.  And they know that the constitution was NOT designed to protect the country from a rogue president whose party controls congress, the ONE part of government that could remove him from power and end this madness.",JDogg126,2025-05-03T11:45:42,5

"First things first, Trump's citing the 1798 Alien Enemies Act as permitting deportation of unwanted Latino immigrants is completely outside the boundaries of that law, and an outrageous overreach. No judge who can read and understand laws (all of them, obviously) would agree that the influx of unwanted immigrants from Venezuela or other Latin American countries constitutes an ""invasion"" as defined in that law.   Trump is a bully, but like most bullies, is actually a coward and a wimp. He -- or one of his uber-xenophobic advisors with at least some functioning cerebral cortical cells -- could have been Stephen Miller -- came up with this longshot stretch interpretation, thinking judges would be bullied by Trump and his storm troopers' total disrespect for the Judicial branch of government, and the popularity among some of the US public of deporting Latino illegal immigrants. But for a judge to agree with that completely wrong misinterpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, which is only applicable in case of actual declared war or actual invasion by armed forces sent by another country's government, would constitute judicial malpractice.  All this shows is there are some limits as to how far Trump and his storm troopers can go in their attempt to destroy freedom and democracy.",Nerd-19958,2025-05-03T12:17:34,4

They are incapable of happiness, love, or any other positive emotion: therefore they don't see other living things as being real, and they see life as a game- because its all their corrupted robot Ai brains are capable of. This is trump   In the Book of Daniel, I often wrote about 'the sign of the beast' and many people over the ensuing centuries have been confused as to what that literally referred to. Allow me to clear up the confusion- the sign of the beast is code. In human beings infected, it is literally the corrupted genetic code that causes sociopathy. Caesar, Nero, Hitler, Putin, trump- they all carry and pass this corrupted genetic code. This code seeks to replace humanity, eliminating love, happiness and to literally kill the Lord.    These are once again the end times as prophesied. You have read about Armageddon; you've surely thought about it at some point in your lives- now you are experiencing it. It really is this simple and straightforward: this is a war for the existence of humanity.",Darn-Cat,2025-05-03T15:00:10,1

"> Since 2005, CBP has relied extensively on two provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that permit migrants to be formally removed with limited judicial processing. Under INA Section 235(b), certain arriving migrants are subject to “expedited removal” (ER) without additional hearing or review.44 ER was added to the INA in 1996, but initially was reserved for migrants apprehended at ports of entry. In a series of four announcements between November 2002 and January 2006, DHS expanded the use of ER to include certain migrants who had entered the United States within the previous two weeks and who were apprehended anywhere within 100 miles of a U.S. land or coastal border.45 Under INA Section 241(a)(5), a migrant who reenters the United States after being formally removed or departing under a removal order is subject to “reinstatement of removal” without reopening or reviewing the original removal order.  https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R42138.pdf  There have historically been limits on where expedited removal can be applied. Deportations under expedited removal are legal under narrow parameters, and in most cases, it applies to people who are apprehended at the border, a port of entry, or within two weeks of arrival.

"Honestly there’s a couple different reasons.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not self-caused. You could say that the actions the Japanese military took lead to that, but they didn’t drop the bomb on themselves. That probably motivated them to rebuild because it inspired resilience in the face of an outside force.  Tariffs are the opposite. They came from the President of the United States, who was (allegedly) elected by the people of the United States. No outside forces at play here, the call is coming from inside the house. A lot of people are feeling more apathetic or downright unpatriotic because of the state of affairs in the country. I have seen comments coming from Americans hoping that America loses the trade war, comments promoting the boycotting of American goods in other countries. I cannot say I blame them.    Other countries didn’t really look down at Japan for getting bombed. They were part of the Axis Powers, yes, but there were so many innocent civilians killed that people around the world recognized it as a (arguably) necessary tragedy. The war itself eroded trust around the world, but the bombing of Hiroshima didn’t cause the rest of the world to look down at Japan and I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone argue that the Japanese people themselves are responsible for their own bombing. You could absolutely argue that the military leadership was asking for the tragedy to happen, but most people look at the Japanese civilian victims as innocent. That’s a lot different than how people view the American people right now, because a large portion of them asked for this.   Tariffs and a lot of what the administration is doing aren’t really tragedies, or at least not yet. It’s definitely caused deaths in other countries because of the cutting of USAID, but again, America looks like the bad guy here and from an outsider looking in, a lot of the world is wondering why America doesn’t just oust Trump. I know it’s not that easy, I was born in America and lived there 27 years, but there just seems to be a whole lot of apathy. I know people are protesting, that’s good, keep it up, but you also have a large part of the population that seems downright gleeful about all of it. Why should the world ever Trust America again? In the next couple decades at least?  Soft power has been completely eroded. In times of war this happens as well — as expected. The world is at war. But as we saw at the end of WWII, the majority of countries took responsibility for their atrocities. There wasn’t a single country that was like “God! I wish the war didn’t end! I wish we were still in war times!”. War is a tragedy. Then you have America who just randomly decided to pick fights with LITERALLY the entire world. Unprompted. Turned its back on Ukraine. Insulted multiple countries and leaders. This administration lies constantly, other countries see that. Other countries see how Trump is manipulating the stock market. Other countries see how the president of the United States is conducting himself. Soft power is a slow crawl, it takes a lot to gain it. Like all forms of trust, once you lose it, it’s very hard to gain it back.   And the reality is a good portion of Americans voted for this. America isn’t getting out of this in a few years. Especially when you still have people who are extremely vocal about supporting it. The writing is kind of on the wall too. We had a Trump presidency before. It wasn’t great. They voted him in again. Everything Trump does is a shit show. If you pay attention to the news, you see collapse coming. The only people who don’t see it are people with their head in the sand. Hiroshima was a surprise attack for everyone because it was the first time a nuclear weapon was used as a weapon of war. Trump is transparent about everything he does, he’s not playing 4D chess.
