Anyone following the economy or the polls already knows the answer.,gradientz,2025-04-28T11:27:47,13
Fuckin no one.   It’s just a mutual game of uncle. That’s all it is. No one wins in these situations.,EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T11:28:09,10
"Ah, yes, one crazy man decides to unilaterally fuck the world economy with powers we’re not even sure he has, and all we’re worried about is the score so far.",Independent-End-2443,2025-04-28T11:54:12,4

"Well, I think each side has very different win-conditions. For the US side it's all about money. For China it is not about money at all, but face and nationalism. The US does not have the cohesion and unity to impose its win-condition on anyone, and certainly not to suffer for it. China has the popular and administrative resolve to suffer pain to reinforce its own status and prestige because outside forces did something to China.   So, yeah. Not looking good for Donald.",MaxieQ,2025-04-28T12:58:05,1
"I would say that while this is doing damage to everybody, only the United States is suffering a loss of power and position in the world and China is actually gaining those regards as we lose.  So China is clearly winning although it is not exactly a clean victory, and ultimately they have very little to do with it because it is more the United States just choosing to lose.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T11:37:48,10
It's a game no one but Trump wanted to play. The response has been appropriate. You can be sure there will be an eventual winner and chances are it won't be the US.,biscuitarse,2025-04-28T11:48:19,3
