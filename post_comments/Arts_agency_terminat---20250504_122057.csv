"So they’re gutting arts, education, science, all social services, education, environmental and consumer protections.  And they’re going to take all that saved money to give more wealth to a few uber powerful people, as well as beef up military and law enforcement presence around the country.  I wonder what happens next?  There’s just no way to know.  If only there were some sort of repository of information at our fingertips that contained thousands of years of documentation on this exact fucking thing happening over and over.",ShrimpieAC,2025-05-04T13:35:39,3
"11. *Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts*   Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.",friendsafariguy11,2025-05-04T15:33:46,2
