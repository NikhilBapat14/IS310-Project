"He’s still doing that weightlifting shtick at rallies? Man, that story always makes him look like such a wimp when he lifts his tiny hands above his head and his face turns red as he clenches his butt like he’s trying not to shit his diaper.   Meliana’s just pissed because it makes him look like a huge man-baby. She “Really Don’t Care” about trans people. “Do you?”",mfGLOVE,2025-05-02T16:34:56,7

She’s not brave enough to be trans. She’s just happy sitting in a loveless marriage to a toddler watching the country she lives in fall apart due to said toddler. She serves no purpose in the grand scheme of life and makes no positive impact in the world 🤷‍♂️,Wizley15,2025-05-02T17:02:07,7

"Being transphobic is, in fact, why LGBTQ+ people question if it matters anymore which party wins. Which, yes, is contributing to 'why we're here'.     This isn't that they go low we go high shit.  This is don't alienate your voter base by becoming bigots to 'gotcha' the right.  Disgusting.",SomeComforts,2025-05-02T16:33:34,9
