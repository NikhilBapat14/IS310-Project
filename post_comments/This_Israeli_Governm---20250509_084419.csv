The Arab Caliphates did the same thing to the region that the European colonial empires did to the Americas.  Byzantinist here. This is a laundry list of confusions and outright falsehoods.  Arabs are also native to Israel and have lived there for thousands of years (cf. the Nabateans), but unlike Jews they have a historical continuity. It was the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius who carried out the final and definitive expulsion of Jews from Roman Palestine around 630 as punishment for defecting to the invading Persians, the Caliphate had nothing to do with that and only conquered the region 6-7 years later. Far from forcing conversions the early Caliphate was actually outright hostile to non-Arabs converting to Islam because their state functions depended on the payment of the jizya tax, and we have records of Umayyad governors refusing to recognize the conversion of provincial populations. This was a major contributing factor in the Abbasid Revolution in 747, after which conversions skyrocketed. Any comparison between Late Antique imperialism and modern settler-colonialism is spurious.  Jewish settlers began to recolonize Palestine en masse almost 1300 years down the line under the auspices of ethnonationalism and the British annexation of the region. Likewise the *urheimat* of the Turks is what is today Mongolia, but if modern Turks were to attempt to 'reclaim' Mongolia now we would obviously consider it an act of genocidal settler-colonialism given it ceased to be a Turkic homeland in the ninth century (which would ironically be *less* of a temporal gap than the one between the Heraclian expulsion and the start of the Zionist holocaust).  All of this is ultimately irrelevant since Israeli settler-colonialism was doomed from the start: unlike earlier European colonialisms which could resolve their internal contradiction (i.e. the need to exterminate natives while also being parasitically reliant on native labor) by continually expanding the definition of whiteness, Zionism has no such option.",jwfallinker,2025-05-10T14:18:57,1

Biden had a very long career, and he was very consistent in his support for just about every war. In 1982, he publicly stated that he IDF should kill women and children in Lebanon, and even Menachem Begin called that extreme.

"On your first point, I agree. The overwhelming majority of US leaders have been monstrous villains. Obviously there is a difference between one president refusing to stop a genocide that would require taking the country to war, and another president affirmatively supplying the bombs that another country is using to commit genocide. The former requires a political capital and risk, while the latter is a simple policy choice.   >I just can't fathom not choosing the lesser of two evils when given the binary choice.  Yeah, I understand this, but I don't agree. I certainly don't fault anyone who voted for Harris because short-term, yeah, she's a better choice than Trump all-around. However, she was the second-in-command of the admin that committed a genocide, she spat on the anti-war leg of her party, and confirmed she would not change policy toward the genocide when in office. So, if you're not willing to withhold your vote when the candidate is promising genocide, what would you withhold your vote for? Anything at all?",Cockbelt,2025-05-09T13:41:03,3
"You call them evacuations, I call it the largest forced-displacement of the Palestinians since the Nakba. What happened to those that refused to leave, smart-ass?   Israel and the US were the ones that consistently refused the ceasefire resolutions. Hamas offered a ceasefire arrangement *in October* for the release of the hostages. Take a wild guess who refused to even entertain the notion. Again, the ceasefire that they did eventually agree on was the same one that Hamas proposed back in May. But I understand the running narrative is that Hamas and Palestinians are dumb barbarians that can't possibly be genuine about anything, unlike the states dropping thousands of bombs on them and intentionally starving children.",mitchconnerrc,2025-05-09T13:46:29,2
"I don’t trust you’ll actually answer so here’s what you left off that precludes Gaza from being a genocide:  “To constitute genocide, there must be a proven intent on the part of perpetrators to physically destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Cultural destruction does not suffice, nor does an intention to simply disperse a group. It is this special intent, or dolus specialis, that makes the crime of genocide so unique. In addition, case law has associated intent with the existence of a State or organizational plan or policy, even if the definition of genocide in international law does not include that element.”",LookWhatlCanDo,2025-05-09T13:51:54,0
"That's just it though. There was no option to stop the war in Gaza without entering it ourselves. We could have cut Israel off entirely and they would have finished annexing the strip and the West Bank within the week before regrouping to fight the entire rest of the Middle East at once.  We did stop providing the bombs that cause indiscriminate destruction. It wasn't enough. It never would have been enough without invading Israel in defense of Gaza or at the very least occupying Gaza ourselves.  No, there is nothing I will withhold my vote for when it comes to the general. I'll fight like hell leading up to it for the best candidate I can find in the primary, but when there is no other option I think we have a duty to choose the path of least suffering no matter what.",Lore-Warden,2025-05-09T13:53:47,0

"Lol, he gave me three whole minutes to respond before assuming I wouldn't. Cute.   What part of any of that contradicts my point?

Bro thought he cooked, lmao.   At this point, you might as well say that the Nazis never intended to destroy the Jews, but just get rid of them(because ethnic cleansing is so much better).

">There was no option to stop the war in Gaza without entering it ourselves  This is simply not correct. Israel is not just a normal country that we happen to do special favors for. They are not self-sufficient. Their existence relies on a massive influx of foreign capital and weapons.   Yeah, we stopped providing 4,000lbs bunker busters (for a limited time), but you don't need that kind of hardware when your goal is destroying daycares, hospitals, and bakeries. Without a constant stream of US bombs and missiles, they would have to fight an actual war, which their Gaza operations have proved they no longer have the capacity for. Their only successes have come from bombarding a population with no air defense. Between that, withholding intelligence sharing, and sanctions which can be imposed by the president, their economy could be crippled in months.   >We could have cut Israel off entirely and they would have finished annexing the strip and the West Bank within the week before regrouping to fight the entire rest of the Middle East at once.  This is just not reality. Iran, Hizbollah, and even Ansar Allah have proven that they can bypass not just the Iron Dome whenever they'd like, but David's Sling as well. Israel cannot fight all of the enemies they've made in the middle east by themselves. The only thing that allows them to constantly be bombing 3 of their neighbors without any retribution is the looming threat of USA reprisals. No country in the ME region is afraid of Israel, they're afraid of Israel's big brother.   Again, I'm not criticizing you or anyone else for voting for Harris.
