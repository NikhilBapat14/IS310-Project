"the furthure back in time you go, the less relevant things become. For example before Arab imperialism there was Roman imerialism which was equally bad if not worse. before that you had Greek imperialism and before that Persian.  Additionally, last Islamic empire (the Othoman empire) was not Arab at all but Turkish so you'd have to talk about Turkish empirialism not Arab.  Finally problem with Western imperialism in particular is that it divied a previously unified region into many failed states/countries.

">Also, some regimes of these territories or nations are de facto fascist and do not align with Leftist values, yet the Left has been vocally supporting some of them even at the cost of proven indigenous people.  I think you're misinterpreting the ""vocal support."" Do leftists support the Iranian or Egyptian governments? No. Do they support an invasion and regime change that will lead to hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths? Also no.   So when Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz say they want to nuke Iran, and people say ""that's bad"" it doesn't mean they support the Iranian government.",Yangervis,2024-09-13T00:52:05,14
"We don't acutely experience the effects of Eastern imperialism of any kind in our daily lives.  It's simply not top of mind.  If pressed, I think most would have a predictably critical point of view toward it.  Exacerbating this; left aligned spaces have distilled most discussions into a pretty succinct flowchart.  White/colonial/capitalism bad, everything else better. On the more rational end this leads to a conclusion that it doesn't serve us to spend conversational bandwidth criticizing the potentially checkered imperialistic past of a disadvantaged minority when there's so much to critique about ongoing American imperialism. On the less rational end, it leads to a blanket apologia of basically all pasts and practices that aren't white/colonial/capitalism.

"The hard left (socialists and beyond) should oppose any form of imperialism, Islamic or not. And often, they do, for example many Kurdish independence groups in the Middle East are socialist organisations and are clearly on the side of the natives, and their right to self-determination. These groups are often in direct conflict with imperialist Islamic forces.   On the ‘soft left’ aka democrats, liberals etc sometimes they get muddled up on issues of morality and side with the wrong people because of mental acrobatics or flabbergastingly lucrative arms sales licences.",CiceroOnGod,2024-09-13T00:25:16,6
"At least from a Marxist perspective, that's not Imperialism, at least not Imperialism in a form that is relevant to Marxists today.  Conquest, migration, and assimilation, and even colonization is not inherently Imperialist in the contemporary, and thus relevant, sense.  ""Colonial policy and imperialism existed before the latest stage of capitalism, and even before capitalism. Rome, founded on slavery, pursued a colonial policy and practised imperialism. But “general” disquisitions on imperialism, which ignore, or put into the background, the fundamental difference between socio-economic formations, inevitably turn into the most vapid banality or bragging, like the comparison: “Greater Rome and Greater Britain."" Lenin, Imperialism, the Highest State of Capitalism, pg 62.  In the simplest terms to describe Imperialism, it is when one country's finance capital tries to monopolize the finance capital of another country. Although the Greeks, Persians, and Romans waged many wars for slaves, started colonial projects and conquered countless peoples, it is qualitatively a different thing altogether than the conquests of say, the British and French in Africa conquered on behalf of their finance capitalists to monopolize newly discovered natural resources. If you wanted to point to a middle eastern Imperialist power in that sense, the only example I can think of is Oman.  Furthermore, who could possibly be held responsible for the spread of Arabic/Islamic culture to these areas today? The only country that still exists in the middle East from before 1700 that I can think of is Oman, who themselves became a victim of British Imperialism",CivilWarfare,2024-09-13T01:30:14,3
"There are a number of reasons this is an entirely bad question, but before we get into that, I'll answer this question with the most charitable view of your perspective I can.  It is probably fair to say that imperial colonialism is more strongly condemned than other forms of imperialistic behavior. I'm going to focus on that lens--why do we get mad at the Brits more than anyone else who ever employed conquest? It's actually pretty simple: the worst parts of colonial imperialism isn't the conquest, it's the colonialism.  What made colonialism different was that it was entirely exploitative. The colonial powers that are excoriated so thoroughly weren't just conquering a foreign people and moving in on their stuff. They were conquering those people, and then NOT moving in, but rather ripping out all their resources to enrich their homeland. This is so much worse than annexing foreign land via conquest. Colonialism in this form is incredibly dehumanizing--not only does it reduce an entire social group to a mere evaluation of resources, extracting resources is almost always done in a particularly brutal way. I am not in any way defending conquest, but at least with conquest the conquerors have a vested stake in the society they are conquering. They can't just extract resources in horribly unsustainable and inhuman ways and then go home to their country because the country they are occupying now IS part of their country. But with colonialism? The range is from ""only sort of inhumane"" to ""holy hell Belgium what is wrong with you.""  But let's get back to my original point: this is really just a bad question. You are painting with horribly broad strokes and it honestly seems pretty racist, which I hope is unintentional. I wouldn't even say the basic premise is true. There have been a few times where wars of conquest have been employed by Arab nations (The Six Day War, the Iran-Iraq War just to name two) and in both cases the Western Left was highly critical of that. And frankly, if anything, the Left has been more willing to give US imperialism in various forms a pass, or have you forgotten about this little thing called the Cold War?  It's also really weird to get bent out of shape about stuff that happened a REALLY long time ago. Sure, Islam was spread by conquest. So was Christianity. Should any Brits that have Saxon blood pack up and sail back to Germany so that the Celts can live in peace? Should the Italians all move away because they were originally conquerors from Rome? Even if we wanted to right all the wrongs of past conquest...is that even possible? Does it make any sense to prioritize the ""indigenous"" Tunisians at this point? Would that culture be familiar to...anyone? It was so long ago that it doesn't make sense. There's a reason we speak negatively about modern Israeli settler behavior but don't really care one bit about the Israelite conquest of Canaan.",mormagils,2024-09-13T12:09:56,3
"It mostly does. Some factions on the internet offer ""critical support"" to Iran as an opponent of the United States, but for the most part, leftists strongly oppose right-wing Islamic regimes. They just don't talk about it as much because the countries that western leftists live in, are already opposed to those governments. When an Islamic Western ally is fundamentalist and authoritarian, like Saudi Arabia, leftists frequently condemn that. Leftists, also however, do not trust or support the West's selective opposition to Islamism, and thus do not support Western interference in the Islamic world as that will only replace one form of authoritarianism  with another",loselyconscious,2024-09-12T23:54:41,5
"We do, it's just not something that comes up at all. All forms of imperialism are wrong, but there isn't a huge point chirping on the imperialism so long ago that the benefactors are no longer around or relevant. Rome, Greece, thr Caliphate, Persia, etc were all empires that did atrocious things, but there are no systems in place from Roman times reinforcing poor conditions for the benefit of Italy or whatever.  Contemporary European imperialism *is* still relevant and to a degree still ongoing.

"In truth, it has nothing to do with historical truth but, in fact, perception. Leftists generally side with underdog in any conflict. Which leads to some dissonance and hypocrisy as your op suggests. While the Arabs were conquering they were not the underdog so at the time if leftists were hearing about it they would probably oppose it. But now since Arabs are perceived as underdogs in terms of global politics since the age of western imperialism, they are supportive of them. This is also why many leftists have criticisms of white people since they were the winners of the western imperialism age and most other races were on the losing side. Had it been flipped leftists would likely support the opposite. So in actuality it’s nothing more than an emotional defense of underdogs.",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-14T11:58:43,0

You make very valid points. Othoman empire was indeed crumbling. I also agree with you that imperialism is bad.  However these countries were unified by this bad impirialism for maybe two thousand years or so (first under roman empire then Arab  then Turks). You can't just break them apart and expect things would work out fine because surely they are better off independent.  Arguing and theoretical talk aside the fact is: these countries were much better before western intervention than they are today.

"Your question was about ancient imperialism, not modern events. The left is vocal against the modern state of Israel because of its actions. Modern Israel was created largely by European Jews with the direct support of imperial powers for imperialist interests. America maintains its support of Israel for imperialist reasons. This has nothing to do with the actions of Islamic empires.  And on that note, the *religion* of Islam colonized the people of Judea, not separate people. There was no time when massive amounts of a different ethnic group settled in Judea and replaced the natives like Europeans did in North America. Ancient empires were largely administrative in nature, not colonial. There were some Greek and Roman colonies but not enough to replace the people of Judea. The Jewish people there were, by encouragement and coercion, converted to Islam. Some of them were forced to leave to Europe and whatnot. Palestinians are the dependents of the ancient Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam. There used to be a population of native Jews as well (called Arab Jews today), but they were assimilated into the European Jews and considered part of that social class.

I think you're missing the point. The folks who criticize imperialistic behavior are consistent.

You and OP are trying to make this about skin color or religious beliefs but it's not about that at all. It's about the amount of time passed.   William the Conqueror was done by boats but it was in 1066. The British Raj was done by boats but it was 1946.

A actually I’m addressing the OP . Hes asking why pro indigenous leftists (which doesn’t include most leftists) condemn British imperialism but not Arab imperialism . Others have already tried to argue (already in this thread)  why British imperialism is somehow different one was that its economic imperialism or that it happened more recently which doesn’t make much sense since British conquests happened over 200 years ago its only that they packed up and left more recently. As for China already in this thread a leftists commented to me that Chinese invasion of Tibet was justified and not imperialism ha and despite my friend losing his arms he deserved it somehow cuz Tibet had serfs ha. This is the blatant hypocrisy and what the op is referring to. You can minimize it and so well not all leftists think this which is fine but clearly some do and it’s not a few bad apples. It also shows that the pro-indigenous logic is not consistent and only in opposition to white invasions. As the argument he gave for China’s invasion being justified was also it a historical connection to Tibet and that it helped defense agaisnt India ha. By that logic Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is justified and Israel taking Palestine is justified but they oppose that. It’s fairly simple I’m just addressing the op point of the clear hyporcrisy... never is it mentioned anywhere about arguments that people should pack up and leave so that is a bit of a straw man.

"Right. Let me rephrase. My point is that I don't agree that there is a broad segment of the left that condemns imperialism only on certain racial lines. In an attempt to give OP as much credit as possible, I explained why *colonialism* is viewed as worse than *conquest* which does have a racial fault line, for understandable reasons.   I just don't see any evidence for the basic assumptions you have here. Citing one guy's personal opinions about China and Tibet is not anything close to reliable evidence--the fact that this person may be wildly hypocritical and also a leftist does not mean that leftists are wildly hypocritical. It's the definition of anecdotal and absent a more reliable form of evidence making this point, it's very fair to just dismiss it entirely.  The rest of the stuff I talked about wasn't a strawman. It was an attempt to move this conversation to a more reliable place where broad statements are actually backed up by evidence, not ""I knew this guy once who was kind of ridiculous."" If you are uninterested in going in that direction, fine! We'll stay where you are where I will say without any charity at all that you are pursuing an unintelligent and racist understanding of this issue, without any critical thinking or analytical interpretation.",mormagils,2024-09-16T14:18:23,1
"Yea the Balfour declaration was it set up with the intention of extracting resources in Palestine for Britain  which is what your claim is for imperialism? ... I asked if Israel was an imperialistic project? You can say it fits your definition now because it’s an ally of the west but not initially. ok, so western finance capital is imperialism but Chinese finance capital is not , I guess because China has spent better part of last ten years monopolizing the second and third world with its finance capital.. And I asked if China is imperialistic and you don’t answer. What if I told you that the superpowers are engaged in a Cold War for global hegemony just like US and Soviet’s? It’s kinda just how the world works. if the US doesn’t monopolize these regions than Russia or China will . There is no world where imperialism is not occurring there is only finite resources for an expanding population therefore it creates conflict .

If it were such a minor amount as u suggest then it likely wouldn’t even be mentioned as part of a divide in opinion  https://isj.org.uk/china-tibet-and-the-left/  “The Tibetan protests provoked a wide range of responses on the left, not all of them expected. It was no surprise that the Cuban Communist Party should fully support China,30 nor that almost all Communist Parties should echo them. The Sino-Soviet split is long over and for most Stalinists China at least still has a ruling Communist Party. Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez’s declaration—”We are strongly with the people of China. We fully support the People’s Republic of China on the Tibet issue. It has our complete and unrestricted solidarity”—could equally be explained by the growing oil trade between Venezuela and China.31  But it was a genuine shock to see anti-capitalists such as Michael Parenti32 or Slavoj Zizek33 defending Chinese rule as being good for ordinary Tibetans”",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-16T15:42:40,2
">so western finance capital is imperialism but Chinese finance capital is not  Chinese finance capital isn't monopolistic in nature unlike Western finance capital. When China gives a loan for something like infrastructure project, typically the project itself is the collateral for that loan. When Western finance capital (World Bank, IMF) makes a loan, it is not only it's own collateral, but it also has conditions which allows western finance capital to further penetrate and monopolize that country, such as being forced to privatize government services and natural resources (almost exclusively to western banks) and to allow political parties/NGOs that are sympathetic to Liberalism.

"First and foremost, thanks for providing some actual evidence here that can help this conversation along.   Regarding the subreddit you linked, I think a really good answer is u/OXIOXIOXI's reply. He points out that it's not really about defending China so much as it is turning the lens of criticism toward the US and a general concern that pushing China too hard on imperialism will have other concerning results for foreign policy that are way worse. The left isn't truly backing Chinese imperialism as much as they are afraid criticism will be ineffective and harmful.   I think I broadly agree with this. Especially among folks that still have a very Cold War-esque mentality (which would probably apply to most folks still stumping for socialism or communism in 2024), I've observed an almost dogmatic need to pick a ""side"" in this economic ideological conflict, and every issue is colored by that approach. But this mentality is very much dying out and it's got less and less of the general ideological headspace with each passing year, mostly because other folks point out linking all these issues into one ideological web creates exactly the kind of silly conclusions you're pointing out here.",mormagils,2024-09-16T16:05:58,0
"Oh boy, yea the imf and world bank of which China is a member and the famous chief economist of the imf who predicted 2008 was Indian. the prescription of market oriented policies is based on economic data showing them to increase gdp growth and thus lifting people out of poverty. as had happened when The policies of Mao were reversed in favor of privatization and subsequently a Chinese middle class was formed. In short , the data shows socialist policies don’t improve poverty , they may improve equality but they make poverty worse. Market oriented policies improve poverty but make inequality worse. It’s basically a trade off. you either have everyone equal but poor or a small poor percent of population while the rest are doing well.   Yes I am aware of criticism of imf in developing nations as it is convenient scapegoat, but you have to dig into the data into each case to actually see the effects of their own policies versus the imf . Rwanda for ex,apple is having an economic miracle and very high gdp growth but I guess it’s not imf fault there   All this is to say , you comventielty ignore Chinese invasion of Tibet but I guess that was morally sound and just trying to help even tho my friend is Tibetan and had to flee here and lost his arms . but yea West bad , east good",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-14T19:20:20,1
"That is only one opinion on the matter and I agree they ultimately want to deter US influence, naively since they think that a So called communist regime will be better for humanity and thus support PRC. Ultimately that is where the leftists logic breaks down because very clearly in all cases, these leftist regimes act basically the same as Western “imperialist” regimes so at that point you must ask if it is simply the way the world works and not something that can be ideologically changed. ie the Powerful dominating the weak. Soviet Union dominated its weaker neighbors and China did as well. So why would A China dominated region be any better for the world than a US one?   That being said, you ignore the others who don’t give that justification , and echo PRC talking points about tibet being ruled by serfs and the invasion being necessary and good for Tibetans . So not about US foreign policy, but about stopping so called abuses in Tibet . And unfortunately, the history shows that abuses didn’t stop in Tibet after the invasion , and basically the Chinese government embarked on a plan to erase Tibetan identity https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization_of_Tibet. So I’m struggling to see how this is better for Tibetan people ? Aren’t leftist position for the people? so  Chinese takeover of Tibet is good even tho Tibetans are being abused because it stops the US from hurting China in the region?",sirfrancpaul,2024-09-16T16:36:32,2
">2008 was Indian  2003-2007, and way to cherry pick the 1 person who wasn't western, and even he lived and in and received an education from, alongside India, Belgium, the United States.   >shows socialist policies don’t improve poverty, they may improve equality but they make poverty worse.  Is this some kind of joke? that's why the Soviet Union went from a rural country on par with 1880s Europe to an industrial powerhouse not only capable enough to smash Nazi Germany but also to provide a diet rivaling the caloric intake of the United States, but also housing, and a first class education to it's people.  >Rwanda for ex,apple is having an economic miracle  Because GDP is your only metric here and it's utterly useless when used in this context. The overwhelming majority of Rwandans do not benefit from a growing GDP if they are still subsistence farmers. Can a growing GDP be a good sign? Sure, but it means nothing if that money is being funneled to the ruling class of another country. The United States also has a growing GDP but the American people are worse off now than they were pre-covid. GDP when taken at face value is actually meaningless.  >All this is to say , you comventielty ignore Chinese invasion of Tibet  Not Imperialism and not relevant to the conversation.

"Actually, it's two different opinions, that both happened to reach the same conclusion. Big difference. But I think you're misunderstanding.

If you read a little closer, you'll see I'm strongly critical of folks who let their feelings about economic ideology override their entire understanding of politics.  If you're asking MY stance on Chinese imperialism, we are in agreement, as are most leftists.

"Not imperialism because China did it?  Tibet was a country that China invaded, annexed, and is oppressing and exploiting.  Oh Tibet was never a part of China before the Chinese invaded.   So what if there was serfdom? It’s not justified to invade and annex a country try based on its societal structure.  Edit: lol you relplied and then blocked me. But here’s my response:  So yes, it’s not imperialism because China did it. No difference between what China did in Tibet to what western countries did elsewhere.  Tibet was a vassal under the Qing who were Manchus and not Chinese. The Manchus purposefully kept and administered Tibet separately from China. So no, Tibet wasn’t a part of China during the Qing.

Well at this point it’s really about the scope of this worldview which is obviously hard to measure but I never even said it was most just that there is certainly this opinion amongst some pro indegneious leftists and not an insignificant one. Obviously largely the moderate wing of the Democratic Party opposes China today but I had thought leftists refer to more further Left than moderate democrats. So namely the socialists and communists. Hasan Piker for example is a large figure on the left who has millions of followers and openly professes that North Korea is the real Korea so I would imagine he supports China’s efforts in Tibet. I can see if he discusses that topic. and Slavo Zizek is maybe the biggest leftist public intellectual and he seemingly supports China’s efforts in Tibet. But ultimately the situation in Tibet and Palestine is fairly similar but you don’t see leftist protesting to return Tibet to the Tibetans. so I think that is what the op is referring to a cognitive dissonance that is clearly apparent,sirfrancpaul,2024-09-16T20:10:08,1

If you are just here to insist on war/annexation being imperialism, go elsewhere. That's not the understanding of imperialism I laid out in the beginning.  >Oh Tibet was never a part of China before the Chinese invaded.   What are you smoking?
