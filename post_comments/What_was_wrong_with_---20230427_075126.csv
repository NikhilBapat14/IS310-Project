"The primary issue Republicans had with her speech is that she is a Democrat, and other problem is that she's trans. There's no hidden meaning, no deeper mystery. The Republicans are starting to seize permanent control of state governments across the country by using their majorities to expel duly elected Democrats.  We don't have to pretend it's anything more than simple fascism.",[deleted],2023-04-28T16:14:06,8
"The Republican Party didn't like it and they have the power and an unassailable majority and believe they can get away with doing what they did. They are likely corrected that. Previously, the social norm was that you didn't pull these kinds of tactics of removing your opponents from office for nonsense, if for no other reason, that if the winds change in your party is in the minority the opposing party might do it to you. It had been something of a gentleman's agreement but what we've seen since Trump became president in 2016 is that a lot of these gentlemen's agreements are illusory. Also because these states are much more polarized than they used to be, there is absolutely no hope whatsoever that the Democrats would ever take Montana in any foreseeable future so they take no risk that the Democrats would retaliate because the Democrats would never gain power in the first place.",[deleted],2023-05-25T18:13:11,2
"So this isn't a great question in the sense that we can't really say for sure. You're asking us to see into the intentions of another person, and that's not something that we can ever do with any sort of certainty.  That said, I think you talk through this issue well. It doesn't appear that you are missing anything, which means your final conclusion seem to be on target. The Reps who expelled her would disagree, though, so it just depends how much you want to take them at their word.",mormagils,2023-04-28T09:25:21,0
"Though I agree with the comment I disagree that it is ""fascism"".  Individual actions are (almost) never fascism. Fascism is the combination of a lot of things.",Hapsbum,2023-05-03T09:37:17,2
"That's what I was thinking it was,  but I was hoping that I was missing something. The group that is always talking about freedom is silencing another American.",asimpleman1997,2023-04-28T16:46:24,1
"My brother in Christ, have you not been paying attention? This is a nationwide strategy playing out in legislatures where republicans hold a super majority.",gripdept,2023-05-13T00:25:50,1
