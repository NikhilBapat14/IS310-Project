"Islam is incompatible with modern society. The followers are actually on par with Nazis, yet the left won't let you speak out against it without labeling you some sort of phobe.  Isn't it strange how the leftists belief system is constantly protecting criminals, terrorists, gangbangers, and extremists while painting the nuclear family as evil?",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-22T12:04:08,108
"Europeans are now Dhimmis.....""protected ones"" who dutifully comply with Sharia rulings and defer to their Muslim masters. Mark my words folks....over the next 30 years we'll see a great wave of migration as freedom-loving Europeans flee the Islamic hell-holes their native countries have become. Only problem is....where do they go? Australia and Canada are not far behind. By an accident of geography, the USA has more time, but if the Dems have their way, our time is coming too.   I'm wondering at what point East Asia will become a future magnate for disaffected Westerners seeking to escape the bonds of dhimmitude that their elites have foisted upon them?",Vessarionovich,2025-04-22T11:55:19,46

">Isn't it strange how the leftists belief system is constantly protecting criminals, terrorists, gangbangers, and extremists while painting the nuclear family as evil?  Sounds a lot like a certain 1930s German chancellor.",theboss2461,2025-04-22T12:57:41,35
"Russia has the Islamic states you are talking about and with their demographic issues and approaches to immigration, I suspect what you are saying will be the case for most of Russia. But Europe is a more mixed bag. Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe have been pretty resistant and Western Europe has nationalist movements that are gaining a lot of steam. I dont know about the future of England though, they will probably cease to be European and transitions into an Eurasian country like Russia. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-22T13:49:42,8
Good point. Poland and Hungary are hopefuls in terms of resisting the Islamization of the Continent.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-22T15:05:50,13
"I wouldn't hold my breath on Hungary though. Their ruling class sees Hungary as a Eurasian and Turkic nation. Turks don't like Arabs and Africans, but most Turks are Muslim and those are the nations Hungarian leadership wants to be on good terms with. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-22T15:10:19,1
"If there's ANY country in Europe that has been restricting Muslim immigration and accentuating its Christian cultural patrimony, it's Hungary under Orban.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-22T16:57:26,9
Poland has been doing so too. I wouldn't hold my breath for Hungary because their political class sees themselves as a Turkic country. ,SlavaAmericana,2025-04-22T17:23:10,8
