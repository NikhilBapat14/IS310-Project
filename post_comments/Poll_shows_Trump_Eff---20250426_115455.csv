"Majority of Canadians hate fascism that is why they are voting for Liberals.  Republican MAGA have infiltrated Canadian politics, and Canadians hate it.",reddittorbrigade,2025-04-26T15:28:11,24
pierre poilievre was practically sleep walking his way to becoming prime minister before trump started pushing the 51st state nonsense. The liberal party of Canada owes trump big time.,newtdawg44,2025-04-26T13:32:24,31
The ignorant old man hates that the world doesn't love him and aren't grateful ... let us make it clear.   We hate you tRUMp and the elongated musty one too ... people will celebrate when you both are no longer in this world.,mizmaggie54,2025-04-26T15:46:28,6

Same with the Labor Party in Australia. Peter Dutton (confusingly the leader of the Liberals but on the right) was leading and then went full Trump just as Trump got in and started shitting all over everything. Now he's crashing and burning. Silver linings.,night_dude,2025-04-26T21:53:26,3
"He will not shut the guck up about Canada becoming the 51st state, so that is making Canadians pragmatic about their choices, none of which are grand.",mangoserpent,2025-04-26T12:18:36,15
"Yes. [Trump said](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k36NoxKz6xg), “I’d rather deal with a Liberal.”",mouthygoddess,2025-04-26T15:18:14,-9
I agree their is no perfect option but carney does seem imo to be the obvious choice as far as resume based on the current challenges.,LHRCheshire,2025-04-26T12:25:31,13
Coming from Trump those words are meaningless.,Captnlunch,2025-04-26T21:56:21,2
Yes but I think that it will be close and the outcome is not guaranteed.,mangoserpent,2025-04-26T12:27:50,4
That wasn’t the question. It was four words and yet… here you are… trying to change it to mean less (or troll a troll).  Liberals hate facts and data but love to attack those pointing out the truth. Has Trump endorsed anyone??? [Yeppers.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k36NoxKz6xg) Clear as it can possibly be.,mouthygoddess,2025-04-27T06:34:19,-4
