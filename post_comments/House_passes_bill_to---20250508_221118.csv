It appears more likely that the vast majority will sleepwalk into dystopia.   A sizeable and aware minority will complain and grumble but will not take direct action and will therefore accept defeat.  A much smaller and vastly outnumbered minority may attempt to undermine and disrupt.  If they cannot organise and recruit enough of the above then it is all over.  Conditions will then need to deteriorate to the point where enough become sufficiently motivated to become receptive to organisation and activity.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-09T06:43:53,2
