"By many accounts, Hilliard, a leafy suburb west of downtown Columbus, is a midwestern success story:      Its progressive school district gives a vacation day for all students to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr ‚Äì the first in Ohio to do so ‚Äì and its homes are highly sought-after by a growing number of diverse families where locals enjoy shopping at the oldest Asian grocery in the state.  But it is also where Christopher Brenner Cook, a convicted terrorist, grew up. In April 2023, Cook and two others were sentenced for conspiring to attack America‚Äôs electrical grid, and he was given a 92-month prison term.  Cook, who was 21 at the time of his sentencing for conspiring to blow up electricity stations, was previously a devout white supremacist who tried to recruit people to the neo-Nazi cause. He focused specifically on children in an effort to avoid detection by law enforcement.  More than 3,780 miles away in Derbyshire, England, 14-year-old Rhianan Rudd encountered Cook on WhatsApp and Discord, the online chat app. As of September 2020, the BBC noted she had been in contact with Cook ‚Äúfor some time‚Äù. By early 2021, Rudd ‚Äì who was autistic and had a history of self-harm ‚Äì was spending up to 15 hours a day speaking to Cook online.  Cook had been grooming, sexually abusing and radicalizing Rudd. The last time she had contact with Cook, he told her he loved her, and she felt a ‚Äúgaping hole‚Äù and ‚Äúvery sad for a long time‚Äù.  In May 2022, aged 16, Rhianan killed herself.  ‚è¨ Bluesky 'bite-sized' article thread (15 min) with extra links üìñüçøüîä  [https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lojmhgnb5d2m](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lojmhgnb5d2m)",johnnierockit,2025-05-06T14:31:32,4

"I'm originally from the midwest, but now live on the west coast.  I had family I had never met visit from Florida. While here, they tried to convince me to move to Florida, which I loudly rejected - I'm not a fan of the south, or southerners, their culture or their politics.

Can confirm.  I grew up in the South and lived five years in Ohio in the 80's before moving back.  I met more openly and aggressively racist people in the five years I was in Ohio than I did in the other three decades I lived in Virginia and Georgia.,code_archeologist,2025-05-06T10:15:09,51
"There‚Äôs some underground hip hop out of Columbus that is awesome. Blueprint is specifically my fav.

"I grew up there in Ohio, and have lived between southwest Ohio and Lexington KY my entire life. Was born in 80, I‚Äôve spent 2 long periods in each area. Kentucky is also conservative but it feels more understandable, granted lexington is a blue area so my experience is somewhat skewed. Kentucky seems to have more of a libertarian bend to it which while possibly misguided I at least understand the general sentiment. Ohio seems completely hell bent on becoming a police state. They seem to love the idea of authoritarianism as long as it hursts people they don‚Äôt like. I still go back to Ohio often because of family, I find it comical how the number of police on the road quadruples as soon as you cross the border.   I love Lexington, I will never live in Ohio again.",Opposite_Equal_6432,2025-05-06T15:15:51,4

"Are we related by any chance? I have a genealogy hobby and some branches of my paternal family have lived there for like at least a couple of centuries or so. My dad and his siblings were all born there and he's the only one who got out of there while both of my paternal grandparents lived and died there but to my knowledge they weren't racist (I actually had a wonderful relationship with my paternal grandma before she passed away in 2023, she literally was my favorite grandmother).  I personally haven't set foot in Ohio in eons (I must have been REAL little the last time I went there in person) but from the things I have heard about it from the people who have been over there it doesn't seem like I'm missing much. The only reason I would consider going there to begin with is to see the graves of my dad (he passed away in 2020) and my grandparents because of how much I loved my dad and grandma in particular and I was named after my grandpa, but from where I live that would require an airplane and probably way more money than I have right now. I just feel like such a bad daughter and granddaughter because of this especially as I love them so much but I believe that all of them are all still with me anyway.
