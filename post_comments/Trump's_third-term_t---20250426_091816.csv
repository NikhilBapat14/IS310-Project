">Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, said Trump’s third-term musings “particularly impact JD Vance and Ron DeSantis and anyone else who wants the favor of Donald Trump. They know they have to stay out of the mix until Donald Trump gives the blessing to go after it and says that he would not be seeking a third term.”  >That’s not likely to happen any time soon. The party expects Trump to draw out an announcement about his future as long as he can, according to a Republican who is close to possible 2028 candidates. The more Trump delays, the more he commands attention and averts the perception that he’s a lame duck.  I want to laugh about all this, but actually, it's nothing to laugh about. trump wants to do something unconstitutional and Republicans are too scared to call him out on it. By the way, to anyone who thinks trump should be impeached right now, this is the state of the Republican party. Republicans won't call trump out on wanting to do something unconstitutional, so why would they impeach and convict him??  >While “there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known,” he said, “I don’t believe in loopholes. I don’t believe in using loopholes.”  This is a ""yuge"" lie!! He LOVES loopholes! trump has never met a loophole he doesn't like. He ALWAYS finds a loophole in absolutely everything. And yes, that could mean running as vance's VP and arranging plans for vance to resign. Yes, trump can find a loophole in the 12th amendment.

No. Thats exactly the point of Trump vs Anderson. States no longer have the ability to block him (or anyone else).  > The question here ultimately becomes is trump smart enough to take the tiny hit to his ego and run as VP so the elected can vacate the seat and give it to him?  Is that even legal, we don't know.    Under the 12th amendment it's not. But see the previous point about the 22nd amendment...it doesnt matter what any amendments say.  >Additionally, your argument assumes the house and senate will remain under republican control in 2026  Not really.  Congress cant pass a law by themselves, the President has to sign it.  If the President vetos it, they can override the veto with a 2/3rds vote.  In just the senate that means 67 votes.  Currently the Democrats hold 47 seats. In 2026 their are 22 Republican seats up for reelection.  Democrats wouldn't just need to win, theyd need to basically run the table to have a veto proof majority.  West Virginia, Oklahoma, Idaho, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee are all in the top 10 most conservative states in the country.  Democrats would need to win at least 4 of them, plus Republican strongholds like Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas, as well as play successful defense in purple Georgia, Virginia and Michigan, to have a shot at having a veto proof majority.

The issue with Section 3 is that there had to be a mechanism to make a categorical determination regarding  disqualification that applies to all states.

"Disclaimer: IANAL.   I don't doubt the majority in the SCOTUS's capacity to pull legal reasoning out of the ether to come to the conclusion they want, but there is a slight difference here. Notably: the legal definition of an insurrection as it pertains to that amendment and who (or what body) gets to say whether or not someone was involved in one. The amendment didn't define any of that, and SCOTUS decided it was up to congress to actually make the call for disqualification (and by extension that they get to decide if the act constituted and insurrection). My not-a-lawyer intuition tells me it *should* have been self executing, especially considering the amendment *explicitly* calls out congress' role in it as reactionary (congress must vote to allow them on the ballot).   But all that to say; there was ambiguity in the text that they exploited.   The term-limiting clause don't have that ambiguity on who it does/does not apply to. The constitution defines what a term of the presidency is, when one begins and ends, etc. What I think they're going to do is look at how it only says a 2-term president cannot be *elected* to a third term and base their ratfuckery on that.",cheraphy,2025-04-26T14:38:21,4
">And? Under the 14th Amendment, anyone who foments an Insurrection cant be President.  This is a rather obvious false equivalency. The language is pretty cut and dry regarding term limits. Running for a 3rd term is a clear violation and there's zero gray area for him to hide in.  Applying the 14th amendment to January 6th was always going to require a lot of heavy lifting. Before you get there you needed to clear a litany of legal hurdles and as much as it pains me to say it, it just wasn't in the cards. There's no doubt he should be in prison for what he did, but the American people are just as guilty as Scotus for giving him a lifeline.
