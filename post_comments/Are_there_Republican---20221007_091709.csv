"Most Republicans don't support student loan forgiveness. [This poll](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/voters-split-student-loan-forgiveness-new-poll-shows-rcna48490) puts the number at 11% in favour; [this poll](https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/31/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-plan-survey/) shows two thirds of Republicans in opposition. I think the sentiment underpinning this tends to be that college graduates are not the most deserving group when it comes to federal assistance, as a college education is already in theory a net benefit regardless of cost, and the student entered the loan agreement willingly without coercion or duress.  Certainly some Republican voters will benefit from the plan, but the college-educated lean Democratic, and voters aren't hyper-rational automatons. Political beliefs are mostly emotional (if there were a single rational answer to an issue, that issue wouldn't be political).",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-10-08T17:15:53,6
"There should be Tax debt forgiveness before student loan forgiveness.  Students wanted, and agreed to *their* debt.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-10-10T19:10:00,0
">I think the sentiment underpinning this tends to be that college graduates are not the most deserving group when it comes to federal assistance, as a college education is already in theory a net benefit regardless of cost, and the student entered the loan agreement willingly without coercion or duress.  I would also say it stems from a relatively recent increase in Republican people viewing college as a ""negative effect on the US"". If you think college education is hurting our country, they certainly don't want to subsidize that education.  https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/08/19/the-growing-partisan-divide-in-views-of-higher-education-2/",ProLifePanda,2022-10-09T11:45:49,5
