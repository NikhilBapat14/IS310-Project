"“Taking SS early” is always the right thing to do IMHO as long as you have a solid 401k & IRAs etc.  Let’s say you get $1000/mo at 62 or $2000 at 72.  I’m using low and round numbers here.  You’ve got $120,000 head start if you start withdrawing at that 62 instead of waiting until 72.  If you live to 82, you’ll have 240,000 if you started collecting at 62.  Or the same 240,000 if you started collecting at 72!  It’s only at 82, in this scenario, where you start to profit from a decision to wait until 72 to retire.  Do your own analysis, but everyone should be building a solid retirement account, and if that works out, you probably want to take your SS on day one.",stay_fr0sty,2025-04-27T07:44:15,21

"I retired early and will be eligible for SS in 1.5 years.  I'll absolutely start SS benefits at 62 or 63.  It makes a lot of sense to do so:  1. Stop/reduce draining of my nest egg 1. I have no dependents/beneficiaries so no one to transfer SS benefits to when I die.  The further I drain my nest egg, the less money there is to leave to my nieces and nephews 1. Republicans will eventually succeed at killing SS and I might as well get what I can before they do 1. It'll take a decade (I forget the actual amount of time) for early benefits to be outpaced by the full benefits at which time I'll be over 70.  Having seen several men in their 70's degrade, I'm really not eager to hit 80 anyways so the reduced benefits of taking SS early isn't that much of penalty 1. With my current nest egg, a small pension available at 67, and SS benefits, I'll be rolling in money enough that I can invest the excess and thus also make up for benefit reduction due to early benefits",rockum,2025-04-27T07:10:29,15

The solvency of Social Security is a political talking point that gets deliberately misrepresented to manipulate voters.  There's multiple ways for congress to fix any potential long-term solvency issues with Social Security. The biggest one is to simply remove the cap on earnings that are taxable by Social Security.  Another way to increase the Social Security pot would be to require Social Security taxes to be paid on other non-wage forms of income like capital gains.

"The wording is a little confusing so not sure what you mean, but in order to get your full benefits, the full retirement age is between 66 and 67 depending on the year you were born. You can take it as early as 62 but for every month early you retire, you get a percentage less than your full benefits. If you wait, you can max out your benefits at 132% which happens around age 71 (you get 8% more for every year you wait) IF you can.

There isn’t a benefit to waiting until Age 75 though.   People are eligible for the max payment if they wait until age 67/68.   The difference between age 62 vs 67 can be massive as well (thousands per month potentially). For people who don’t have a separate retirement fund it is better to wait as long as they can if they can still work.  For most people waiting until 65-67 they will draw enough monthly income to support themselves. The amount most people can draw at age 62 isn’t enough to support themselves without a supplementary income.,Unlikely-Piano-2708,2025-04-27T18:06:23,0

Agree! I think the cap should be removed entirely. Also believe - and the numbers I think show - that you don’t achieve balance without looking at benefits for high income/net worth retirees.

Social Security is PAYGO system. Current contributions pay for current benefits. If current law was rewritten to do as you propose - divert contributions into interest bearing “accounts” earning 3% interest - then what would pay for current beneficiaries’ Social Security benefit? Think it through and let me know!  Look, bottom line is that current law means that once the SS trust fund (which is an accounting tactic, not some magical treasure trove with actual assets) balance hits zero the system is barred from borrowing or using other general revenue. Barring any changes that means an immediate, deep, across-the-board benefit cut around 2033.  Or, you know, we might try making even modest reforms now (like removing the income cap on SS taxes, or cutting benefits for high income/net worth retirees) to try and prevent that from happening.
