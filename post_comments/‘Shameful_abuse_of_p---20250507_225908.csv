Bit more about the teachers themselves:  [https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/filipino-teachers-cultural-exchange-hawaii-public-schools/](https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/filipino-teachers-cultural-exchange-hawaii-public-schools/)  Sound like excellent teachers.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-08T01:17:22,22
This is a just a shit show of ICE officers trying to rise up the ladder. If I get ten more than Jack Iâ€™m due for a raise.,JackKovack,2025-05-08T01:32:32,14
"Going after teachers instead of traffickers? Thatâ€™s not justice, itâ€™s a flex, a scare tactic, and a damn disgrace. When classrooms become targets, you know the systemâ€™s lost the plot.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-08T05:27:27,11
"In DC, ICE just raided a bilingual elementary school during school hours. They held no warrants when they did.   No information on why so far. But there's two options: they were going after teachers/staff, or they were trying to hold kids hostage to get parents to come out.   One is an incredibly stupid use of energy. The other would be genuinely evil. Either way... absolutely worthless posturing that helps nobody.",Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-05-08T07:24:09,7

"Oh no, both are a demonstration of malice. Make no mistake.  Its ice. They're pretty much nazis, and educators are always among the first targets under fascist as authoritarian regimes.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T17:05:29,1
