"According to the article, his approval rating shifted by roughly 2.5ish percent. This is well within the margin of error on every poll I am aware of. Kinda seems like a nothingburger.",JohnnieCochring,2025-05-08T13:04:29,15
"Looking at the underlying data in the Big Data poll is wild. 18.2% of Liberal respondents would vote for a Republican for their House of Representatives if held today.  19.4% of those same liberals have a ""very favorable"" opinion of Trump. How is that even a thing?",UnpopularOpinionAlt,2025-05-08T13:13:46,9

"Haven't seen any taken down Trump flags put back up. Give it 6 weeks, when everybody is looking at empty shelves and Trump is bragging about his imaginary trade deals.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-08T13:17:44,8
Yeah I don’t think so but sure keep kissing his ass,SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-08T13:08:42,5
"I wouldn't be too surprised, because his approval rating largely goes down due to tariffs. Now the stock market is back up and the tariffs talk seems soften. I would say it is just more like a bounce back, because the inflation and recession is still coming up. Unless we avert those and the economy really going great, if not I don't see his approval rating can be recovered.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-08T13:17:51,3
"While he keeps threatening to run for a third term, I cannot personally wait until after the midterms when he is a lame duck. Maybe Congress will finally grow a pair.",yeatsbaby,2025-05-08T13:52:12,2

I've been saying for a long time that right wingers purposely lie on polls to skew results. Polls should just go away. ,overfiend1976,2025-05-08T13:34:01,8
Tim Poole used to claim he was a liberal. Doesn’t mean it was ever true.,prodigalpariah,2025-05-08T13:40:25,2
Because Liberals are just conservatives by a different name.,TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-08T14:44:35,1
What if he isn't a lame duck and Republicans hold both?,TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-08T14:45:05,1
"If he doesn't seek a stupid ""third term,"" he will be a lame duck even with a GOP Congress.",yeatsbaby,2025-05-08T15:49:22,1
"Why would he not seek a third term? I feel like he can do whatever he wants at this point, seems no one will stop him",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-08T15:50:51,1
I hear you. Maybe death will stop him.,yeatsbaby,2025-05-08T16:03:24,1
