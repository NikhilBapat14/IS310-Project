"""TM Signal's archiving feature appears to fundamentally undermine Signal's flagship security guarantees, sending messages between the app and a user's message archive without end-to-end encryption, thus making users' communications accessible to TeleMessage.""",amir_twist_of_fate,2025-05-07T10:57:47,17

"A lot of people don't realize how secure Signal is, there is a reason why Military and Intelligence folks like using it (when you set it up and use it correctly, i.e. locking it down and not inviting journalists into your chats). I can't imagine why they'd be using a clone other than they're just....*really* incompetent. Which is probably the case.",GarageFridgeSoda,2025-05-07T11:14:26,6
Somehow it not really being signal is worse than using the actual app,mymar101,2025-05-07T12:22:17,5

"Without the zero knowledge vendor aspect, it’s not reasonable to even call this a “signal clone”.",peacefinder,2025-05-07T14:39:24,1
"Such an obvious Israeli intelligence operation. Let's assume there's a legitimate need for the offering, when officials have to use Signal or whatever to talk to somebody outside the government but log everything... It would be so simple to send an object with some digest of the (encrypted) message to the ""TeleMessage"" firm's servers for audit tracking, but make the archival agent receiving and confirming that each audited object was archived successfully be just another modified Signal client which gets added to every chat that official users start.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-05-07T11:47:01,9
"They should be using a clone, an in-house clone that only works with itself and no archiving   If they want to use this kind if app",Tricky_Damage5981,2025-05-07T11:31:57,4
It’s not so secure that you can’t add the wrong person to your chat group. See Hesgeth for example l. It’s nowhere near secure as the stuff built by the government to be secure. The only reason they like using it is to avoid accountability,mymar101,2025-05-07T12:24:00,1
