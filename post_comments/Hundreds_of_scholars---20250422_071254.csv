"> While the vast majority of scholars surveyed say Trump is pushing the country toward autocracy, other professors strongly disagree. James Campbell, a retired political scientist at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, says Trump is using legitimate presidential powers to address long-standing problems. Campbell points to Trump's use of tariffs to try to push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. In recent decades, economic globalization led to catastrophic layoffs of everyone from furniture makers in North Carolina to auto assembly-line workers in the Midwest as firms sent work overseas, especially to China.  > **""I think they've done an excellent job,"" Campbell says of the Trump administration.**  ü§®  > Campbell adds that he thinks many political scientists may see Trump as autocratic because they don't like him or his politics.  > ""I think most of them are coming from the political left,"" he says. ""There's a comfort in all of them getting together and saying, 'Oh, Trump's a bad guy. He's authoritarian.' ""  Sure, that must be it.   ‚ÄúAm I so out of touch?

"I strongly agree & don‚Äôt dispute their conclusions, however I disagree that he‚Äôs doing it well or competently or in any way which will manage to stabilize. The whole reason autocracies work and people stay silent is because they deliver the illusion of stability, but Trump isn‚Äôt doing this. He‚Äôs causing unrest and a possible economic recession.  His policies have already lead to mass protests in the hundreds of thousands or millions ‚Äî it took Erdogan and Orban years to get to that level of public demonstrations of dissent. Their early years were marked by economic growth and stability ‚Äî that‚Äôs how they entrenched their power.   His approval rating continues to slide off a cliff ‚Äî yes, I know that in the minds of many Redditors, they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe!‚Äù he still has a solid base, but 53-55% disapproval in the modern polarized US with deep party loyalty is actually quite an achievement. People say ‚Äúwell he still has 80-90% approval among Republicans‚Äù ‚Äî but he always will, the part they‚Äôre missing is that the Republican voter base itself is shrinking.   I‚Äôm just gonna call it now, and I could be wrong ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs just hopium, but having studied history I‚Äôll bet he can‚Äôt keep order and hold onto power for that long.   Maybe I‚Äôll be eating my hat in an El Salvadoran prison in a couple years, but my prediction is this: The authoritarianism continues to deepen while, simultaneously, the economy gets worse and worse and unrest deepens until we reach a flashpoint ‚Äî midterms obviously rigged, a major arrest, hell maybe it‚Äôs just massive unemployment ‚Äî and the protests that have already happened get more frequent and worse to a point where he does something stupid to try and stay in power, like invoking the Insurrection Act, which unless he has some internet kill-switch only makes things worse, and the Republicans blink and impeach him.   This is unfathomable now, but Mike Johnson & co. aren‚Äôt completely brainless ‚Äî they‚Äôve studied history, they know Trump needs stability & what happens when you mix economic chaos with autocratic repression, even if Trump himself doesn‚Äôt. And ultimately as much as they‚Äôd like to retain power they don‚Äôt want a color revolution in the United States, because that‚Äôs a far more existential threat than opposition control.",iwefjsdo,2025-04-22T08:23:18,14

"[Your Full Name] [Your Street Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]  The Honorable [Senator‚Äôs Full Name] [Senator‚Äôs Office Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]  Dear Senator [Last Name],  I am writing to you not just as a concerned constituent, but as an American witnessing a critical unraveling of our democratic norms, laws, and institutions. At this moment, the usual boundaries of governance‚Äîpolicy debates, procedural checks, institutional courtesies‚Äîare being willfully ignored or weaponized by a regime that does not recognize the rule of law or the legitimacy of constitutional constraint. This is not politics as usual. This is a crisis.  When those in power defy the very structures that give them legitimacy, the response from Congress cannot be one of business-as-usual. This moment demands more than words, more than symbolic resistance. It demands that those elected to defend the Constitution rise to meet the urgency of the threat we now face.  If the legislative levers of Congress are now insufficient to stop this slide into authoritarianism‚Äîwhether through obstruction, executive overreach, or judicial complicity‚Äîthen the people must be called to act. That call must come from you and others with a platform, the moral courage, and the constitutional duty to sound the alarm.  Use your megaphone. Speak to the nation. Make it unambiguously clear that what is happening is a coordinated attack on democracy‚Äîand that it will not be tolerated. It is time to organize a nationwide response that matches the scale of this emergency.  A general strike is no longer a radical idea; it is a rational defense of a system under siege. We cannot be expected to continue contributing to a society that enables or tolerates the dismantling of our rights, freedoms, and the very rule of law.  History will remember what you did in this moment. I urge you: Do not be complicit through silence. Be the voice that helps galvanize the people.

"I think we have long been taking a path as a country that has led us here. We are no longer ""swiftly heading"" - we are there, and honestly have been more of an oligarchy and less a representative democracy for a while - but I digress. Also..America is far from clean when it has come to standing up authoritarian regimes in other nations. We know the deal.  As much as I would love to be an optimist here, I cannot. I was optimistic Trump voters would see the error of their ways during covid, then during J6, then with a second impeachment...yet here we are. The positive I am taking from this: I believe we are currently in an authoritarian state. It sucks, it is scary, it's new to most of us. But in reality Trump is not the sickness, he is a nasty symptom of a larger affliction - Americans embracing their most xenophobic, sexist, racist and other awful inner beliefs. Do some feel like they have been forgotten socially or economically? Sure. Is Trump the answer? Oh god no.  These people want to watch everyone else suffer and watch the world burn. They all have their reason whether hate, ignorance, entitlement, whatever. The comfort I take in this is that I don't think an authoritarian regime will hold up here over time. They will break something beyond repair that they cannot fix...and the course will be corrected. But there is no ""going back"". The curtain is pulled back and the truth is visible in all it's nastiness. We cannot rely on politics as usual and need to re-build something better and more equitable from the ashes of what this admin is burning down. Will we?

"There are a few obvious points you hear circulating on stuff like this. Freedom of the press, income inequality, long-standing political grievances that just sit unaddressed for decades at a time, the usual obvious suspects. Those are all absolutely true and are incredibly depressing if you side-by-side compare us to some of the ME governments.  A specific comparison I *don't* see brought up as much is the role of education + employment/marriage prospects of young men. There was a very specific trend with many ME countries (especially the more socialist-y states) where the government mass incentivized education and then was unable to provide gainful employment to many of the people who made it through their education system. Economically prospectless young men are one of the greatest markers of incoming radicalization and civil unrest, notably in the ME but we see other examples all across the world. We in the US have a serious problem with this and I'd point to the birthrate and housing market as major warning signs here.  Political polarization and assaults on electoral representation are another marker. I finished my degree specifically in terrorism--mostly in the ME, but the standard reading included plenty of discussions on Ireland. Something that really stuck with me is that popular support for terrorism in Ireland was extremely low in areas that felt they had proper political representation. When the general public felt like they had no agency or voice, popular support for terrorism was much higher. It sounds really obvious in hindsight. But apply that same analysis to our country. We have a two-party system where neither party offers what the vast majority of people want. We have a ridiculous one-person-take-all system where roughly 50% of the population will be completely ignored no matter what. I've voted in 4 states and my vote has never mattered even once in my life--gerrymandered safe red/blue district in a safe red/blue state every single time. A huge % of our country is very reasonably disenchanted with our elections and has been for as long as I've been alive. Toss gridlock into it, and nobody feels like the government is working for them.  Keeping it pretty high level because this sort of thing could easily sprawl into...pages, so please let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to talk about. But the Mangione shooting and its public reaction stood out to me as strong indicators we're close to the edge of a cliff where the public feels so disempowered in the current system that they're increasingly alright with violent solutions. Health insurance is a very easy canary in the coalmine here because Americans are straight-up powerless as this deeply unpopular group of cartels mass slaughters Americans for cheap cash--it's kind of the epitomization of the sort of ""no politician will stop these people from killing us no matter how loud we scream"" discontent that primes people for violence.",Sminahin,2025-04-22T12:16:16,34

"To also be clear before the inevitable angry screeching at me begins, no I'm not advocating for China or pretending they haven't done horrible immoral things, I just want to stay objective and have a conversation about this.   China manufactures most of the shit we buy and use in our daily lives, China has the raw materials needed, they haven't invaded anyone since the 50's (if you count the Korean war), they've been building high speed rail all over their country, and they've generally been a reliable partner in everything they've signed. The poverty rate in China is 1,5% of the total population, in the US it's 12,5%.  Fuck, they're even doing better than the US in the fight against climate change.  Meanwhile, the US loves to invade a new country every 20 years just to keep things exciting, and now they're outright tossing around the idea of invading a fucking NATO ally while buddying up with Putin and telling him to ""do whatever"" with NATO countries.  The US have shown themselves now to be completely untrustworthy. Nothing the americans say can be trusted anymore, because no matter what they promise, tomorrow it might be completely different. Yesterday we were friends and allies, today you're taking Putin's side, so who knows what you'll do tomorrow?   With all of this, I don't see anything wrong with having better relations with China. People have been trying to drum up this image of China as an enemy, but all they do is trade with us. It's our allies the americans who are threatening us with invasion and war.",kannettavakettu,2025-04-22T12:08:10,14

"Yeah, it's depressing. Honestly, most of the red flags you see when reading about rising violence or state-level decline boil down to exactly that: people thinking the current system is broken and that it's custodians will not improve things. Either from incompetence or corruption.  The dysfunction in America is so systemic that people of many ages (especially under-50s) and many education levels all have a different, equally legitimate views of the dysfunction. I went to school for politics for 7 years, so my lens is very PoliSci. I genuinely think our two-party system is fundamentally broken while also preventing its own correction--you need a supermajority within the current system to fix a problem that prevents supermajorities, where reform is not in the best interests of the people you need to drive that reform.  My neighbors viewed broken roads, factories closing, and the impoverishment of our neighborhoods as their own sign of a failing state. And I can't say they're wrong, given our rising income inequality and how this happened.  Personally, I was in college when the late 2000s financial crisis hit. Missed my window to get ahead and acquire housing before the collapse. In my early 20s, I essentially had to make peace with never having kids if I wanted to have a home and a middle-class lifestyle--a decision that panned out when I got sick and devastated my finances on that. And then in my 30s, my husband got sick and we had to give our life's savings to Anthem, validating that decision. Most of my friends are in the same boat--many of my friends want kids, but only a few very lucky ones will ever realize that dream and surveys on childbirth rates show economics are a significant driver for this trend. The 35-and-under birthrate is what, less than half of what it was 20 years ago and the primary reason cited is economic? It's honestly really sad and sucks. And that exact feeling is a driver of radicalization all across the world. Because working towards a family is what keeps a lot of people going--very few people are working their jobs and chasing promotions for the love of the job. Especially with how men in most societies have been conditioned to believe that is their progression path through life, so when you've got all these young men staring down the barrel of never being able to afford a house + a family and trying to figure out what their lives will be...you get radicalization.  China may be in for a rough time with this exact issue.",Sminahin,2025-04-22T14:13:22,14
">It's strange to my mind that, after reading your post, I can see several relatively simple solutions to these hairballs. Implementing ""simple"" solutions isn't so simple because there's always a contingent of conservatives obstructing every attempt to make progress or improve.  For the most part, yeah. It's maddening. Because it'd be really easy for someone with basic civics knowledge to quickly & safely fix huge chunks of our current system. But the system is designed in a way that prevents any course correction. Two party + supermajority + passing this might put the current parties (certainly current leadership) out of business. It will never happen organically and I've seen that realization genuinely cause existential crises for hopeful political types.  >And to think Biden had hundreds of thousands of union jobs in the works through his Infrastructure Bill and other building/revitalizing projects.  So...yes, but I also think Biden failed miserably here. We Dems have been really bad at owning our victories for a long time. There was literally zero messaging where I grew up to the point that Republicans routinely got credit for all kinds of things they had nothing to do with. And Biden was the worst political messenger we've seen in lifetimes on top of that.  And what's more, we were pushing these extremely long-term solutions when people were focused on immediate cost of living problems. Even Biden's shorter-term projects delivered in glacial timelines results that peer countries can seemingly do with the snap of their fingers. So we had a decent product, but we were awful at delivering it on time and even worse than usual at selling it.  >The average American doesn't seem to be able to grasp¬†*who*¬†is preventing a better system.  >For instance, there have been attempts to socialize or otherwise improve the healthcare system, improve education, increase wages, expand union representation, etc., and Americans seem clueless as to which individuals and parties have obstructed these things.  >They continue to vote for people that hurt them.  Yeah, again it's really frustrating. I grew up in a very poor part of the rustbelt where basically nobody followed politics. I was raised political and volunteering on campaigns since middle school, so that always baffled me until my family got really sick and I was stuck working \~16h a day to keep everyone housed and alive. First time in decades I missed my near-daily Guardian and NYT reads, sometimes didn't check for weeks/months, and I got a lot more sympathy for people who aren't politically engaged.  Our party has gotten *really* bad at messaging to people who aren't very well informed politically. Getting and staying informed like that is a privilege with strong class associations. Therefore our party has gotten really bad at talking to people across class lines--our messengers are overwhelmingly from one side of that divide.
