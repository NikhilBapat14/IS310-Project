"From the article    “Trump’s exchange with Moran, however, made it seem like Trump believed the letters and numbers were part of the original tattoo.   “That was Photoshopped? Terry you can’t do that,” Trump told Moran.     “Hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime,” he continued. “You’re doing the interview. I picked you because—frankly I never heard of you but that’s OK. I picked you but you’re not being very nice. He had ‘MS-13’ tattooed—”    “We’ll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else,” Moran said.     “Terry. Terry. Do you want me to show you the picture?” Trump said.”    More from the article:  “He doesn’t have a criminal record, and no court has found him to be a member of a gang. Instead, Trump officials have offered up tenuous evidence of Abrego Garcia’s MS-13 “membership,” including the tattoos.     “No, no. Terry. Terry,” Trump insisted. “No, no. No, no. He had ‘M-S’ as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.’ This is why people no longer believe the news, because—”  And more from the article:    “At that point Moran—who had responded to Trump’s earlier digs with a smile—sighed the kind of deep sigh that parents of toddlers know well.     He pointed out that the word “MS-13” doesn’t appear in any of the photos of Abrego Garcia that have been taken since he was deported to El Salvador.   “Terry!” Trump interjected.     “Ukraine, sir,” Moran practically begged.     “He’s got ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles, okay?” Trump said. “You’re just such a disservice. Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes he does’ and go on to something else?”    “It’s contested,” Moran replied. “Ukraine.”",Gerryislandgirl,2025-04-30T07:05:14,4539

"If you're accustomed to just reading headlines, you should try to actually read the article here. It's not long. And it's fascinating because of two things  1. It suggests that Trump thinks the literal letters & numbers ""M-S-1-3"" are tattooed on Abrego Garcia's knuckles, when they're clearly photoshopped to provide a 'possible' (but obviously dubious) interpretation of the actual tattoos, which are images of a skull and marijuana. Trump thinks the photoshopped letters are the actual tattoos. If this is true, a man was deported over a fake image.   2. At the end, Trump can't let go that the interviewer doesn't agree with him that ""MS13"" is tattooed on the man's knuckles. He says ""why can't you just say 'yes sir' and move on?"" Providing insight into his thinking... Which is that in his world, there is no truth except his own personal truth, and everyone must agree to it. He must bend the narrative to his will.

"[Timestamped YT audio link of relevant part of interview](https://youtu.be/9rx2clbAzno?t=1321).

Garcia has four *symbols* on his knuckles; a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull.  However, [in a widely circulated photo](https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/74MTWK6ZINDD5LN2MXFVWXHYOQ.jpg?auth=925d7d12297187fef6cab163cfd1e7f81e0f16f09f1a25eae944a8b11dde3106&width=800&height=449), Trump has posed with a picture of the knuckles, with the letters 'M-S-1-3' clearly **digitally \*edited** above the symbols; as if someone thought that *must* be what those symbols 'mean', so needs to 'point it out' to everyone (this assertion is highly discredited, including by existing gang members).

"I hate to break news here, but he’s *stupid*.  He’s not “controversial” or “brazen”, he’s just not very smart and profoundly ignorant.  He knows not one thing about any relevant policy (health care, trade, economics, taxes, foreign affairs, energy, science, history…).    Talking about his “strategy” in imposing tariffs is a category error.  He has no strategy.  He actually thinks trade deficits are inherently bad because they have the word “deficit” in there, so someone invented a “formula” that tried to justify it.  He thinks “insane asylums” emptied all their people into the US because he doesn’t understand the phrase “political asylum”.    The best thing Dems can do is use the word “stupid” as often as possible, especially regarding these statements and policies.

Trump is accustomed to saying something completely false and having his cultists believe it without question. If Trump came out and said the sky was made of cheese, they would all nod in agreement. But this reporter isn’t doing that. So Trump just keeps repeating the lie, hoping eventually the reporter will give in and agree with him that this lie is in fact the truth, and he’s frustrated it’s not working.  Thing number two is Trump actually and honestly believes the characters are not Photoshopped and are actually tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s hand. This thing is even more disturbing because it means Trump is, either due to his psychology or his age, unable to tell the difference between the truth and a lie. It means he can be more easily manipulated than we thought before.

"‘Trump melts down at being fact checked’   BUT - he wasn’t fact checked. The journalist ran away from the line of questioning as fast as he could. There are so many things he could have asked: who in his team briefed him? What was Trump’s knowledge of this case? Take him up on his offer to look at the photo together, etc etc   Just to copy a question I asked in another sub-reddit on the same topic:   I’m Australian. I know about the photoshopped image; what I don’t understand is the journalist or his approach.  I don’t recognise the journalist. What’s his background? Why is he working so hard to let Trump off the hook?  For context: During covid, Australian journalist Jonathan Swann won a lot of praise in the US for his interview where he calmly and methodically dismantled Trump’s lack of understanding of the pandemic. Swann just approached that interview the same way that any number of Australian or British journalists would interview a politician: keep asking and reframing the question until you get an actual answer. Challenge the response with data.   I genuinely don’t understand how it is that, on the rare occasion that Trump submits himself to a non-Fox interview, no one seems inclined to properly question him, or to dismantle his bullshit responses.  As Jonathan Swann showed, Trump quickly goes to pieces under the least amount of rigorous questioning.

Then read the answer:  “I don’t like private schools.”   Will lead to a political debate about “The Democrat agenda.”  “Gas cost me a lot today.”   Will lead to a political debate about Biden.  “Canada just held an election.”   Will lead to a debate as to how awful the nation is.  “Man there is war everywhere.”   Leads to a debate on how Trump is a peacemaker.  “I want McDonalds but I think I’ll order it.”   You guessed it; debating about Biden.  Finally, “I like basketball.”  Yep this one is easy and you’re probably close. No it’s not trans folk in sports like you’d think… it’s a debate about trans folk having a right to exist without interference in their life.

"Trump Melts Down at Being Fact-Checked Right to His Face  The president lashed out when challenged on his claims about the tattoos on deported dad’s left hand.  Janna Brancolini  Updated Apr. 30 2025 7:03AM EDT  Published Apr. 30 2025 5:59AM EDT    > President Donald Trump complained that an interviewer for ABC News wasn’t “being very nice” when he refused to back up the president’s claims about a Maryland dad who was mistakenly deported.  > During an interview Tuesday with Terry Moran to mark the first 100 days of his second term as president, Trump insisted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador’s brutal CECOT mega-prison on March 15, had “MS-13” tattooed across his knuckles.  > Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran migrant who lived in the U.S. legally with a work permit and was erroneously deported to El Salvador in March. “There’s a dispute about that,” Moran said, trying to move on to the next topic.  > “Wait a minute. Wait a minute,” Trump objected. “He had ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles, tattooed.”  > “He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way,” Moran clarified. “But let’s move on.”  > Earlier this month, Trump posted a photo on social media of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s hand showing four tattoos—a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull. In the picture, the numbers and letters “M-S-1-3” were digitally added above each tattoo to argue that the symbols were a code to signify gang membership.  > Experts, however, have said the tattoos are not associated with Mara Salvatrucha, a criminal gang that originated among Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s. The gang spread to Central America when its members were deported to El Salvador after the Salvadoran civil war ended in the early 1990s.  > Criminal justice experts told CBS News that members have been known to tattoo the gang’s colloquial name “MS-13” on their bodies, along with images of devil horns. But a community activist who had worked with gang members for more than 25 years said he had never seen a gang member with Abrego Garcia’s knuckle tattoos.",ElderPimpx,2025-04-30T08:15:24,2

"There have been a few articles lately that claim that Trump's foremost goal is simply to be as famous as possible; it is essentially the only thing he cares about, and the presidency/politics are only meaningful to him insofar as they can serve as vehicles for this aspiration.  You can see an echo of that in this clip. Upon being challenged (even on a fairly obscure point), Trump's instinct is to dress this guy down for not being famous. Talk of the photo/tattoos/photoshop stops instantly since it doesn't matter. Trump needs to tell the audience that he's never heard of his interviewer.  (I suspect Trump also starts and then aborts an attempt to threaten the reviewer's livelihood, with the ""giving you the big break of a lifetime"" remark. Can't prove that or be certain, but to me it looks like Trump was heading this way and realized it was a bad idea).  Really creepy how the actual events and issues (i.e. people's lives and liberty) do not mean a thing to the President of the USA, unless they can be leveraged to either affirm Trump's self-image or boost his media profile.  I hereby predict that he'll push the button during this term: someone will mention that Truman (a democrat!) is the only person ever to have authorized a nuclear strike.

Over the course of what was apparently less than two minutes but what felt like hours, Trump calmy, confidently, and affirmatively made clear that he believes “MS13” is tattooed onto Kilmar Albrego Garcia’s knuckles in Arial font.  It was not a meltdown. It was smug, confident condescension of a man so assured in his correctness, so sure of his gotcha leverage that he began to joyfully ramble about how much of a nothing the interviewer was.  I still don’t know the best word replacement for ‘meltdown,’ but I think a reframed header would work better anyways.

It seems that the most likely scenario is that Trump has a level of technological literacy that’s slightly lower than that of the average 78 year old and, when skimming the file, misunderstood the image, was somehow allowed to Tweet (or Truth?) about it unsupervised and now refuses to back down.

"Prediction: In the next day or two Trump will release a new picture. It will be one of two options with the following explanation:  1. A new photo of the tattooed hand, but with the numbers and letters photoshopped to look *even more* realistic. He will claim that this one is the real the one he saw, and will say that it is the real proof.   2. A new photo of the tattooed hand, but with the numbers and letters off the hand and with lines pointing to each tattoo. He will not address his own stupid lie, but will mention that the person who made the original photo admitted that it looked *a bit too real* and could fool *many people*.",orcinyadders,2025-04-30T10:14:50,1

"Say what you will about him, I definitely see flaws in his work and it's well documented, but I think Johnny Harris actually did a pretty good job in his Trump bio video, talking about what motivates and humiliates Trump. It basically boiled down to: ""Don't be a sucker; Strive to be attributed fame and success no matter your involvement or the cost.""   I think he can't stand being embarrassed on TV, as it's his primary medium of entertainment and communication, as it was and is for his generation.  (btw I am in no way saying this validates the rest of JH's work btw, just seems to track pretty well with current and past Trump moments.

The whole fucking point of the label is that the MS13 is in a code, it's as good as MS13, now to me that sounds plausible, you know like the 2 of hearts and 7 of clubs tattoo in the movie Nobody, it needs to be interpreted.  So is this true, are those really coded symbols that mean MS13 and is recognised as that or did someone just make that up on the fly and just lie their way through. That is still in doubt and isn't it the news reporters' job to research that claim that the symbols translate into that? Couldn't they query the govt, on what authority they used to interpret the symbols that way.  And this is why Trump is president, no one is really doing their job well, Harris was not prepared for the debate, she had no familiarity with the granular details of important trump bullshit points like the election was stolen.",you_are_soul,2025-05-01T08:50:56,0

Now you know that bit at the end where Trump pouts like a child ""why can't you just say yes?"" Ignore that. See those images of Trump holding the photo of the Tattoo on his hand? Don't look at that.

"Because Trump appeals to the ""lowest common denominator""  (LCD) citizen. Trump is a dullard, full stop, he doesn't understand how societal and political problems work, is too lazy and egotistical to be bothered with learning about it, and thus oversimplifies problems and solutions, leveraging a sledgehammer when the solution calls for a scalpel.   Trump's rhetorical style and problem-solution perspective appeals to these LCD citizens because, like Trump, they are also dullards who an intellectually incurious and/or lacking the intellectual hard skills to even approach understanding nuance and complexity inherent to most modern societal and political problems. Furthermore, these LCD citizens, like Trump, are cowards in more than one way, they live in perpetual fear of varying degrees that all of these problems are existential threats.  Humans traditionally desire control or the illusion of control over their environment and existence, problem is modern societies and governments require so much scale and complexity that most of us have very little in the way of doing anything about these large problems or our lives. This is an uncomfortable realization, that we have very little means of influencing our society, our laws, and our environment as individuals. Many afflictions in the modern era are so large and complex that it takes multinational coalitions of governments to even begin tackling said problems (e.g. Climate Change).   So instead of stoically facing the reality of their existence, that problems are deeply complex, don't have one/easy solution, and the true scale of these problems is out of the question for LCD citizens. They're incapable of the critical analysis, intellectual curiosity, and cognitive processing to grasp these issues fully, that's why we have experts in these fields to tackle these issues, people who dedicate their academic and professional lives to focused areas of research and solutions because they require that level of academic and professional education to even approach beginning to understand and maybe solve these problems. The LCD citizens are largely undereducated, and due to their perspective, find experts an uncomfortable confrontation of reality meeting their chosen worldview. They believe problems are simple (because they cannot comprehend complex problems/nuance), thus solutions are simple. Experts are ""wrong"" because they diametrically oppose their worldview and principles. To reconcile this, they dismiss, mock, and falsely equate their under-informed ""opinions"" with expert observation and theories. We see their discomfort and dissonance not met with growth and curiosity, but with stalwart rejection of academia, learning, even the desire to tear down institutional learning. These people are capable, but wholly unwilling, even violently so, against adapting.   Trump hits all of these same points, perspectives, and internalized monologues these citizens have through naked rhetoric, spoken in simple parlance. Trump approaches problems and solutions the same way they do. He is manifest of all of their flaws they hold to be their identity and way they approach the world, even if they know deep down they are wrong for it. Trump sanctions and validates them, and by winning a seat of power (POTUS) further legitimizes and makes them feel empowered in their skewed view that they are ""correct"". Trump helps provide medicinal comfort and psychological cushioning that they are not ""losers"" and dolts, that they're actually ""powerful"" and capable. The ""experts"" are wrong and these dullards are somehow able to hammer through these ""complex"" problems with ""common sense"" solutions.   We largely got here because we didn't do enough to fight back on the war on education, expertise, and intellectualism. There will always be idiots, willful or not, there will always be people with varying degrees of cognitive capability due to their genetics and upbringing. Intellectualism can be wholly inclusive, not something closed off. Even those lacking profound intellectual skills can still acquire and foster curiosity about their world. They can still understand concepts of nuance and complexity, even if they lack the cognitive skills and/or educational background to fully grasp it. If we allow the war on education, learning, and expertise to continue, our world will look like Idiocracy very quickly and people like Trump will continue to acquire power. Unfortunately, as usual, the smartest people int he room have to sacrifice and do the lion's share of work in this ""group project"" because the sobering fact is there are far more of these dullards than there are experts and ""smart"" folks.

"Hatred, fear, and/or apathy.  Seeing a black man in the White House broke so many brains. This was a major catalyst but not the end-all reason.  Most members of my family aren't racist, but they despise the idea of their taxes being used for any purpose other than self-enrichment. Since they are self made upper-lower class, everyone else should be able to obtain the same success without government assistance. Never mind that my tax dollars fund vouchers for their children's private schools now.  The part that is even more difficult to stomach is that the Republican Party has been more successful with messaging that motivates voters. They, more so than Dems, are willing to compromise ethics and race to the bottom if it scores more votes. Many stay unified and double-down despite evidence or even common sense.  Many leftists despise both parties and refuse to compromise and vote for the lesser of two evils. Democrats are lukewarm with opposition to authoritarianism and cater to centrism rather than left-leaning populism. Some are waiting for a revolution rather than taking any measurable action.  I vote blue. I also stay quiet about it because representing anything other than conservatism in the deep south risks my professional success and capability to provide for my household. My cowardice protects my upper-lower class status while failing to affect the change I wish to see. Any influence I could have rarely travels further than my household and closest friends.

Now this is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the question, why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for President, choose to reject upholding the constitution?

Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours.""

"We have a lingering infestation of greedy racist white christians in this country and Trump convinced them that the Democrats were eating babies, jacking up taxes, leaving the border to Mexico wide open, and making children LGBTQ. He took all the frustration that people had from the pandemic and weaponized it against the Democrats. ""All your woes are because of Biden. Biden Biden Biden.""  And he never relented on his Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. When you succeed in vilifying your opponent, your followers are more likely to believe your lies and disbelieve the accusations made against you. By vilifying Obama, Hillary, Biden, and then Harris, Trump made himself immune to the rape and fraud allegations. He played the victim constantly, like he was a virtuous leader in exile.  And then there was the (supposed) assassination attempt. That made him a living martyr for millions of otherwise inactive voters. It was almost too perfectly timed, wasn't it? And that photographer was in just the right spot at just the right time to get the perfect angle with the flag behind him while he punched the sky like a goddamn hero. And oh boy did Trump milk it.  Having said all that, I still think it's impossible that he won all seven swing states and that not a single red county flipped blue. I think Musk rigged it and Trump spilled the beans when he talked about how Musk ""knows those vote-counting computers"". Plus, Kamala's campaign was flawless and I don't care what the critics say in their attempts to explain her loss. Her and Walz were friggin celebrities by election day. They had every possible endorsement a candidate could ask for. She had Taylor Swift's full endorsement, and Obama and even other world leaders. She pummeled Trump in the debate and made him look like the ignorant fool he is. And Walz was the perfect running mate for her - a down-to-earth kind American Dad who was a beloved Governor with authenticity that no other politician can match. When Biden dropped out of the race, the left was cheering and so proud, they weren't concerned about the primaries. We were simply relieved and excited for Kamala. We didn't reject her because of the primary thing, like the MAGAs would have people believe. We rallied behind her and Walz.  So no, the math doesn't math and despite whatever advantages Trump may have had, I refuse to believe he won fair and square. All these nationwide protests suggest to me that Trump isn't nearly as popular as the election would have suggested. What we're seeing is the population's response to an illegitimate President.

That's where a lot of Trump supporters are now.  They are exhausted from the constant drama and the way Trump takes advantage of their loyalty, but they are too invested to back down, and afraid of the shame they will face when they do finally break up, because it will be a shockwave to their whole social circle, family, and a large part of their identity.

"Let's not forget how many people in his base are folks from Evangelical backgrounds where the entire culture is about blind Faith, leadership from above through various tribulations, utter devotion, and a powerful us versus them mentality where they have been raised to see their side as the one and only righteous and true one.    Over the winter, I was volunteering my time at a local business learning cobbling. The fellow that was mentoring me is a die-hard Trump supporter, who fell into it via the religion and wellness He and his family are evangelicals who homeschooled their three, now adult children, dabbled in the whole raw milk thing back in the early aughts s and regret vaccinating their kids. Me, I'm a social anarchist, feminist Taoist who's fascinated by science and uses my voice as an adult autistic person In the avenues of autism self advocacy, social justice and ethics. And the longer that I was there, the more that I learned about the depth of this guy's devotion to the current regime, the more that my own opinions started filtering out of my mouth because I just couldn't keep quiet and I remember him telling me, I understand that you're scared for the future, but you just have to trust in the president, the press secretary, and the AG, those three are the ones that are going to tell you the truth. The holy Trinity of BSers, and this man was telling me to put all my faith in them  It wasn't long after that, that we amicably parted ways - I knew that if I stayed much longer, it wasn't going to be so amicable. I ended my time there at the end of February, right before all of the mess with all of the tariffs started, when we knew they were all around the corner, and this fella gets a majority of his materials from Germany and Italy, and I can't help but wonder how that's going to be affecting the bottom line of his business. He's a good dude, misguided but I understand the why behind his voting even though I don't agree with it at all in the least, and it just sucked to see somebody so blindly following a path that would possibly lead to his business being in danger of closing. As it was, before I left, shipping costs were already starting to skyrocket just to send things domestically through the USPS, and I can only imagine how his bottom line is being affected now. And his business offers a service that's exceedingly rare these days, and he has an expertise that you can't just find anywhere - he's been doing this work for over 16 years full time, and I would hate to see him have to close.

Literally just need basic math skills and the ability to focus for more than five minutes on a task. We've hired people who lasted less than a week, and others who lasted months but couldn't get good parts done with miles of tolerance. My boss when I started tried to tell me which parts of my job I might struggle with, but it's all been the easiest shit I've ever done. Came from 10 years of making coffee and dealing with the kind of people who drink way too much coffee to loading raw steel into machines and pushing buttons to make them cut bits off. Something is seriously wrong with our countrymen right now. I'm not even that smart, but apparently just being self aware enough to say that makes me smarter than 90% of the guys I work with.   One guy, been here for 15 years, crashed a drill into the side of his machine after his program had 5 different failsafes to make sure that didn't happen.

"Well said; I think the vast majority of people have turned against their better judgment because it’s easier to believe that the social media post about covid being manufactured in a lab than to think that we have so thoroughly screwed ourselves on this planet that we are going to start seeing viruses that made Ebola look like a good time. They aren't going to be willing to believe that because of the massive increase in the over-prescription of antibiotics, we have essentially been breeding superbugs.   I think at the heart of it all is a set of simple facts.

"I don’t think most Americans are dumb—I really don’t. What we’re seeing is the result of decades of psychological manipulation. There’s been an enormous, coordinated effort—billions of dollars and countless hours—spent convincing the average middle-class, moderate-to-conservative American that the left is out to destroy their way of life.  And honestly, we let it happen. We turned a blind eye while misinformation and propaganda ran wild on social media. We caught foreign governments meddling in our business, and instead of putting a stop to it, a lot of our elected officials chose to benefit from the chaos. No accountability, no guardrails.  People on Reddit tend to be politically aware and plugged into a variety of sources, so we can spot the manipulation. But if you’re, say, a 60-year-old farmer in rural Indiana whose main news source is Facebook and a few buddies at the feed store, you’re up against a stacked deck. Not because you’re unintelligent, but because the game is rigged.  What we need—desperately—is a serious national conversation about the realities of AI-generated content, foreign propaganda, and misinformation networks. Instead, we’re getting theater. Imagine fighting WWII and letting Hitler hang posters on every street corner in Times Square. That’s where we are.  There’s a real conversation to be had about how to balance free speech with protecting the public from weaponized lies.

">*If you came into it not knowing anything about Trump and the story,* you could walk away thinking the reporter was the one lying by how quickly he kept trying to move on.   Exactly  I've been saying the same thing about Trump coverage, especially headlines (we're looking at you, NYT), for years now. Like, I think editors should have a test where they ask themselves of all Trump headlines (because let's be real, no one reads the articles), ""how does the framing sound to someone who is entirely politically disconnected and doesn't know anything at all about the story? What would they take away from this? What is implied by this?""  For example, a month or two ago, Washington Post ran a headline ""Trump's dark anti-Ukraine *turn.*"" (emphasis my own). How does that headline read if you really don't know jack shit about the situation? Well, first of all, it reads like Trump once supported Ukraine, which is not even remotely true. One of his impeachments in his first term was for denying Ukraine military aid in hopes to extort them into saying they're opening an investigation into Joe Biden. How can he **turn** when he's currently standing further down the *straight line* he was always facing? It also implies that it was a recent turn (by virtue of it being the story right now and not a story at some earlier point), as if he was just sane and normal, supporting Ukraine, and then now in 2025 finally went off the rails. That alone implies the existence of a more sane Trump, that we all know isn't real.  And that shit is pernicious. Some young kid could just now start becoming politically active, just now start paying attention, and may take away from stuff like that headline that Trump once was actually sort of normal, that his first term wasn't too bad (a ton of headlines lately are written to imply just that), and someone, you or I, may be saying ""Trump has been awful the whole time! He has never supported Ukraine! All of this shit he's doing this term is an extension of the shit he did his first term!"" and they might think you're being over the top or lying.

"Here's the problem with that. When he came to power in the 30's, Germany was on it's knees. People used literal wheelbarrows of money to pay for ordinary items. When he came to power, he brought them out of that depression, lowered prices, increased jobs and investments, and generally brought back their economy from disaster.    This ass hat got it backwards. Trump took office with a good economy and now is in the process of tanking it, sending tens of thousands to the unemployment lines, and dismantling all the safety nets including health and human services. Kind of the opposite of what the other bigoted xenophobic racist did. At least in the beginning he gave his supporters results to the impression that life was going to be better under him.

They've essentially merged their nationality, lifestyle, internal sense of self, community, religious beliefs, political leanings, their entire identity into one singular ideology.   To these people, their support of Trump is synonymous with their belief in God, which synonymous to their views about themselves being ""good people"", which is synonymous with their views about being American.       This is why they will never turn against Trump. To turn against Trump would mean they have to re-evaluate their entire belief system. They can't do that, so instead they latch onto any lie that calms their cognitive dissonance.   If they hear Trump caused an insurrection. Their default view is ""this can not possibly be true, I'm a good person, I'm a good American, therefore the person i support has to be a good person and a good american, therefore this isn't true"" and thus they immediately believe the lies that Jan 6th was just a walk in the park, over-exaggerated, or antifa false flags.

"I think racism is a secondary issue though. Focusing on the right to own slaves let people continue to run massive plantations at low costs, letting them dodge the economic issues of the time. Since then, certain parts of the American leadership have doubled down on blaming black people for crime (like they blame immigrants today). It's the same narrative and the same drivers, just different targets.   I don't think the average American is more inherently prone to lower intelligence or higher bigotry than any other person in the world. The issue is that certain American leaders spout messages that blame a minority group for problems and promise quick fixes, in exchange for political power. On top of that, where they have won power, they attack the education system that would improve Americans ability to recognize such demagoguery.   The result of that process is a deeply divided culture where roughly half the population doesn't value intelligence or wisdom and has been steeped in bigotry so long that it's almost inherently true.   I will agree that the civil war basically just morphed into a culture war. But it's a culture war made by politicians who want power and drive that culture war forward. ",ottawadeveloper,2025-04-30T08:23:19,61
"I disagree with this and I think this way of thinking is a big part of why democrats lose so often. Probably an unpopular opinion on here, but the stupidity and reluctance to change is what drives the racism too. People generally aren’t born racist, they are looking at the problems in their lives and problems facing the country and will buy into blaming anyone they can distance themselves from. If it’s brown people causing the problem it couldn’t be me. It couldn’t be that my pastor was wrong about Trump because what else might he be wrong about. It couldn’t be that my family members are actually the welfare queens. In a way I think the “they’re just racist” excuse is the equivalent lazy excuse for our side. If we can just explain it with racism it keeps us from looking at the areas we have failed. It’s easy to discount opinions from the other side because who cares what a racist POS is going through.

Yes, livestock and cows especially contribute significantly to climate change. No, no one relevant is trying to outright ban them. We're definitely trying to encourage alternate sources of protein, but an outright ban on cattle is a laughably childish proposition at this point in time.  There is another story recently like that. I saw so many headlines with something to the effect of: ""Trump is trying to ban women from voting!"" Again, the oversimplified and rage-inducing version of the story that spread. It's childish and easily dismissed as childish compared to the real story, which is still very very bad. The reality is that they want to put legal hoops in front of voting that people who've changed their name have to jump through, which is largely married women. The actual effect of the law will be that people who don't have the resources or knowledge to jump through those hoops will be disenfranchised.

The issue is that so many journalists have slowly gotten into this uniquely American ""Well let's just move on, can't have my interviewee get uncomfortable nor have awkward silences or arguments on air"" that we allow a STAGGERING amount of stupidity to be spewed and then just move on. I get that he's interviewing a vindictive toddler, but this style of journalism is now the norm in the US and that's incredibly troubling.

"People don't understand how someone with dementia comes off. They are still able to communicate, and it seems like they understand, but if you go even a little deeper, it falls apart. This is because they learn strategies to kind of sound normal. Trump has a bunch of phrases he will just repeat. He also will echo back what others are saying, but with certain transformations. If you look at Trump in 2015 vs. now, the decline is obvious. His vocabulary has dramatically decreased, and the complexity of his sentences has gone way down. He also can't remember context well, so he can end up rambling because he loses context of the conversation and can't ""unwind."" You essentially end up with an infinite tangent where locally it kind of makes sense, but at a high level, there is no coherent idea communicated. People with dementia can still kind of seem to communicate and follow basic social expectations for a long time. They are usually the last things to go. It can really throw some people off and make them think the person with dementia is functioning far better than they actually are.

"I’m a 30 year veteran teacher in the South. The education system here produces a certain type of adult. The students can barely read and critical thinking is discouraged unless you are in a “privileged area” where the funds flow. Sure, the Confederacy minded people are plentiful but they receive little education as well. For example, if a student puts his name on the assignment that’s a 50 in some cases. We close the state government to celebrate the Confederacy. That type of thinking  won’t fly so easily in Germany. It’s going to be interesting because the more this government flashes the violence and disrespectful physical behavior at their rallies  towards illegal immigrants and people they don’t agree with the more disrespectful and violent their followers will become.  It is only a matter of time before almost every American will have to make a decision to fight, flight or be subservient in one way or another. I’m a Bible based conservative. I’ve not met one lib or lefty that agrees with torture, graping, forced labor and human trafficking. However, every MAGA person I’ve spoken to about the Confederacy is proud of the Confederate heritage and support it. The Confederacy that produced a constitution the supported and enforced human chattel slavery which of course includes torture, graping, forced labor and trafficking.

Pittsburgh has toxic levels of lead in the water.  Central Valley, California produces one-fourth of the nation’s food, but the fertilizers and pesticides used on farms have seeped into the aquifers and polluted the groundwater. Nitrates seeping into the water far exceed the safe limit set by the EPA.  In 2000, a coal company spilled 300 million gallons of coal slurry into the waterways of Martin County, Kentucky and contaminated the system with arsenic and mercury. Two decades later, the problem with water supply continues with outages and boil water advisories.
