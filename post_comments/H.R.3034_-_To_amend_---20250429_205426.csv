"For those curious,  right now the minimum length you can get a smooth bore shotgun barrel is 18"" you can only get shorter if you file paperwork with local law enforcement and pay for a special tax stamp on top of the price of the equipment. If they remove the restriction you would still have to go through traditional background check.",Canard427,2025-04-29T21:11:34,11

"It's silly bullshit to try to claim that a sawed-off shotgun is not a ""firearm."" It amounts to people trying to get around changing harder-to-change laws by pulling a fast one with labeling.  This is in REALLY bad faith. Fuck it. I don't care if it means that everyone that wants a ""shorter"" shotgun currently also gets a delicate kiss atop their little noses in addition to their more cheaper purchasing process. I STILL DON'T LIKE THE LEGISLATION.  For that matter, those taxes exist for a reason. I want that tax *paid* into the public coffers; not avoided.",Lurlex,2025-04-29T21:16:16,8

The argument isn't that they aren't firearms. It's to remove them from being covered by the National Firearms Act (NFA) and all that entails. Much in the way you can go buy and a handgun or many common rifles/shotguns and those are not covered by the NFA.,Boomshtick414,2025-04-29T21:31:48,8

"All of your rights are already bound up in taxes, names or otherwise, including that one.  Voting taxes exist in states that require IDs that are not freely provided by the State. In areas that require more than an hour of transportation to make it to their designated polling place, or force people to spend money getting a copy of their own birth certificate or SSN card (other things that should be free) so that they can even REGISTER to vote — those are all taxes, even if they are not so named.  If you want a position on the radio airwaves to put on a bunch of talk-show hosts to fill truckers’ and your dad’s ear with a lot of right-wing AM radio to make sure Republicans keep winning in red states … you need your broadcast license, among a lot other things paid and in place, before your first avatar utters their first word over the air on behalf of your political views.  Want to protest in public? Permit!!! Want to make use of the court system to defend your rights? Fees for filing a court case!  Regardless of how you feel about it, all of your rights are already taxed. That you have never paused to reflect on it being so does not make taxes on your right to bear arms any more egregious.  Just about the only freedom that we do not tax is that of worship, and that is a status that remains controversial given how modern American churches do not feel obligated to maintain their end of the bargain and not manipulate private sectors or direct the votes of their partitioners.  I’m happy to tax guns that don’t need to be in the hands of civilians into oblivion. Doesn’t bother my constitutional sensibilities in the slightest. If you want to REALLY start respecting those rights to the point that we wouldn’t dare start attaching costs to them, you have a lot of places just with voting itself to start with.  Alabama is a great spot for Site Zero in eliminating income-based problems with access to voting! I’m glad you’re so concerned about it.",Lurlex,2025-05-02T14:50:44,1

"The right to bear arms does not designate what ‘arms’ constitute. Maybe 2A should have been written better, or if anyone in Congress gave a damn about ‘gun rights’ they would amend the constitution or put force federal legislation to be more clear on what ‘arms’ are.

"It is easier to say what it covers. It covers machine guns (full automatics or burst fire), Rifles less than 26'' long or with a barrel less than 16''. Shotguns less than 26'' long or barrel less 18'' long. Then you have suppressors and destructive devices (non-shotgun firearms with a bore greater than .50 inch, bombs, grenades, etc).

Correct. It still is. Just removing the SBR requirement.,Karabiner555,2025-04-29T21:22:05,8
The “National Firearm Act” only regulates certain kinds of firearms. Like machine guns.   Anything you can buy at a Dick’s Sporting Goods already isn’t regulated by the NFA.

"First, the legal term is ""dangerous **and** unusual"", not ""dangerous **or** unusual"".  Every weapon is ""dangerous"" when used.  In the same manner, a car, screwdriver, or stove is also dangerous.  As to unusual, there are two problems there.  First, what is unusual?  Because of the ""sporting purposes""^1 ban from 1968, coupled with the 1986 freeze on registering new weapons, there is an artificial scarcity on Registrable automatic firearms.  In addition, these firearms are slowly breaking down and wearing out.  I've never seen any official count on registered automatics, but some of the higher estimates I've seen put the number at a quarter million.  Or about one machine gun for every fourteen hundred people.  Is that unusual?  I think so.  But I also think that it is unnatural.  Scarcity by fiat, not by running out of the basic materials.  The other problem with banning or restricting unusual weapons, is it stifles progress.  Take, for instance, the California handgun roster.  As I understand (not being from there), you can only buy from a dealer a weapon on that list.^2 What this has done is to ban the sale of newer versions of handguns, where safety and ergonomic concerns have been addressed.  Imagine if a state put a freeze on cars made after 1985.  That would mean you couldn't buy a car with a third brake light, anti-lock braking, airbags, backup cameras, or a glow-in-the-dark trunk latch.  The idea of not being able to buy a car with such safety implementations isn't ridiculous. It's not even Ludacris. Such an idea is Plaid.  How is restricting the same in a handgun any less idiotic?   1. Defined by the ATF as hunting and target shooting only  2. My understanding is there is a loophole that allows LEOs to sell personal weapons to civilians that are not on the roster.",n0tqu1tesane,2025-04-29T22:41:09,-7
> there's nothing that says that they can't apply a tax to that purchase.  The tax applies to home built regulated items also. So you if fasten you own suppressor from cans it would require that $200 tax stamp.,Thrown_Account_,2025-04-29T23:02:43,2

"You need to read up more on California handguns. The handguns that California restrict are mainly due to safety reasons, and that they do not pass a drop test. Do you want to carry a handgun that may go off if dropped?  In protest, many manufacturers refuse to submit guns for testing.  But what does that really say about the manufacture?  They know the gun isn’t safe, but will sell it elsewhere.",Ok-Tourist-511,2025-04-30T07:10:17,0
