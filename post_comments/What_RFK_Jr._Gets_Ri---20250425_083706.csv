"This ""seeing more"" concept is due to a lot of factors. A concept i think we all need to understand is diagnostic inflation/diagnostic expansion. It is essentially when you become aware and start spreading awareness for these illnesses, more people get diagnosed and treated as people are more educated. For example, 30 years ago people were lobotomized physically or chemically for having BPD, depression, anxiety, etc. because the culture was that stuff was taboo and you were possessed by the devil. Autism wasnt even fully understood and most autistic people were wrote off as intellectually handicapped. Now that we have studied autism and have grown the awareness while reducing the stigma, we see a spike in diagnoses and treatment. Also with mental illnesses that have a spectrum of presentations, you will inherently see broader scopes of diagnoses and treatments. It is not a stretch to say that inorganic compounds that we have in our food, clothing, water, etc effect typical nuero development and are contributing to an increase in autism. However, it is wrong to say that this is solely due to these factors and that 50 years ago the reason you didnt hear about autism is because no one had it. No one talked about it because it was taboo and looked down upon. You would lock your child away or send them to an institution to get lobotomized or receive electric shock therapy. The increase in rates is almost entirely due to awareness and genuine treatment for conditions now. However, there are direct links to when develope technology and see increase in illness. For example, when we invented and installed linoleum floors we saw autoimmune diseases skyrocket. This is because kids used to play in dirt and interact with pathogens on a daily basis and build up immune tolerance. Then a generation of people lived in sterile environments decreasing tolerance and causing massive immune responses as adults resulting in autoimmune disorders or allergies. Modern medicine and modern technology is making us less healthy on a diagnostic rate, but we are living longer lives which means that is not having effect on overall fitness of the population. In conclusion, what RFK gets right is saying that these chemicals we claim are ""safe"" might not actually be safe, but what he gets wrong is looking at a trend and immediately making a conclusion. Correlation does not equal causation and this is the worst type of logical fallacy and is why he is an absolute idiot.",edgyteen03911,2025-04-25T13:34:23,33
"Part of the problem is the following. I copied the text directly from Wikipedia rather than rewording it myself.     Asperger syndrome has been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is no longer a diagnosis in the WHO's ICD-11 or the APA's DSM-5-TR. It was considered milder than other diagnoses which were merged into ASD due to relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.     I have twins. One has Aspergers. The other is autistic. When they merged so many things into the autism label, much was lost. There is a night and day difference between my sons but they now are both deemed autistic. My Aspie son is intelligent and fully functional in society (although awkward and not very social). He had some challenges because of the lack of social cues which he has had to work to compensate. My autistic son will never be able to live on his own. He can read, write, do math, dress himself, make simple food for himself but he has no awareness of danger, no concept of time. He could never run a household or hold a job. He can, however, play any musical instrument by ear and has perfect pitch. A savant in that area.",Theloripalooza,2025-04-25T12:00:21,19
"They need to scale back the definition of autism.  Hell, everyone on reddit says they’re autistic.  No they’re not.  A vast majority are shut in basement dwellers with no social skills.  That’s not autism!",bw2082,2025-04-25T08:51:36,35

"I wish the ""we're getting better at diagnosing it"" mentality would stop. There has absolutely been an increase. I've been teaching for 15 years and 10-15 years ago there would be 1 special ed kid in class. This year I have 4 with autism, a teacher at another school has 5. 4 out of 22 is absolutely insane. And I definitely would have noticed kindergartners in diapers, nonverbal, wandering and leaving the classroom, throwing things and biting before all this ""new diagnosing"".",North-Currency-1572,2025-04-26T15:58:10,1
"We over diagnose stuff, but I also tend to think there is an epidemic that is hard to pin down. I think autism is indeed linked to vaccines and that this neurodivergence stuff that we hear so many people self diagnosing I think is more legitimate than many in this thread want to admit. That said, if it is indeed true that vaccines or some other chemical is causing that much autism, neurodivergency, adhd, etc., there is nothing we can do about peope that have these things except hope that they can cope with it. It doesn't always help to diagnose people with disorders, especially when they have already learned effective coping strategies.  So I do believe there is indeed an epidemic, and I'm convinced it's largely environmental, but likely a mix of things, pollution and vaccines being a part of it, but perhaps additives, perhaps cell phone radiation, perhaps wifi is adding to it. But it's a subtle epidemic.  We think of epidemics as big overt illnesses that are easy to document (at least once we learn about them), but there is also an epidemic of inflammation going on that manifests itself I'm severe cases and very mild cases that people just live with without trying to treat.  I think that is what we are seeing with autism, adhd, neurodevergence (at least the real stuff) and perhaps some anxiety.  EDIT: Mobile typos",MikeyPh,2025-04-25T10:51:21,-19
"Aspie son sounds like one of my friends. Works in the finance field now, used to travel and win video game tournaments in SE Asia while playing slower than competitors just top notch strategy. I could watch him play for hours. He'd sometimes stop our friend group during a conversation and ask if we were using sarcasm or not because he doesn't understand it. Fascinating observing it.",VictorVonD278,2025-04-25T13:10:10,2
"I heard that being good with technology, like I am, and socially awkward is supposed to be on the spectrum.  So being a NERD is autism? Like in Revenge of the Nerds?",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-25T11:36:30,12
"I think part of the problem is that even with the current definition of autism, it's diagnosed by observation of behavior. So there's no lab test for it, AFAIK there's no brain structure to be seen on MRIs or brain chemistry to check for. The possible links between genetics and autism are poorly understood and may not even be correctly identified, and it's reasonable at this point to assume that not all cases of autism even have a genetic component.   So you've got people with a list of symptoms and behaviors to look for, and even if every one of these people are well trained and completely unbiased the diagnosis still relies on the observer's subjectivity. So even with a perfect definition, we don't have a perfect diagnostic process.  Sure, there's going to be plenty of cases where even the daftest layman can say ""yep, that person is severely autistic"" and plenty of cases where there's no reason whatsoever to think an individual has any degree of autism at all. But that leaves a wide swath of people who may be autistic, or maybe they're just weird people.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-25T11:15:33,9
It's definetly autism just not you know autism. We need to scale back a lot of diagnosis and soon. No everyone is infact not abnormal they're just ill equipped to handle reality.,snusboi,2025-04-25T09:49:32,-4
"Sorry you are getting killed by the bots and faux conservatives of reddit.  People are more than happy to eat the explanation they are given by the mainstream media handed down by their corporate masters.  Its been this way for a long time and that won't change.  Its absolutely a developmental cumulative trauma etiology with unique genetic variables influencing manifestation.  That right there is like ""evidence based"" medicine kryptonite.  They lack sufficient methodology to explore something that complex, and it tells you everything it needs to that everyone is so happy with the ""it's being seen more now because of diagnostic criteria change"" explanation.  The biggest takehome message in the psy-op is absolute confidence in WHATS NOT causing it.  In order to make that a coherent point with as few logic flaws as possible they need to push the narrative it's always been present in society and just under diagnosed.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-25T14:55:07,1

"> Its absolutely a developmental cumulative trauma etiology with unique genetic variables influencing manifestation. That right there is like ""evidence based"" medicine kryptonite.  I wish more people understood this. And thank you for sharing this terminology with me because I was relatively sure this had a technical term and I'm glad to now know it. I wasn't sure that it had one though, because 1) I'm a lay person, and 2) because I wasn't so sure people had yet recognized this phenomenon enough to have studied it enough to even put a term to it. So part of me is relieved to know this term exists and others far smarter than I know about it.   Another part of me is utterly disappointed in ourselves and our trust in medicine and our food system. It wasn't that long ago that pollution was rampant, with car production plants just dumping paint and other chemicals into rivers. What makes us think that we are now immune to reckless behavior.  I am very much for the free market, but it also requires diligence to catch those willing to destroy ourselves for a profit, and the wherewithal to know that they will hide these crimes, whether it be in secret dumping locations, or in the data.  I had testicular cancer when I was a kid, my father appears to me to have some kind of autism, I have some symptoms of what I might consider a spectrum disorder, I get migraines and have other issues. I wonder how much of all of that would be gone had I not been vaccinated as a kid, or been exposed to food dyes and various pesticides that has laced our food supply for upwards of a century now.  And I really wish more people saw this. You get the lefties who just throw this out entirely as hogwash and label it the same as that autism conspiracy that has ""no evidence"" (and no, it has no legitimate studies because who would pay for that and what pharma companies wouldn't put a stop to that if they could). Then you have the right wing folks who don't want to hear this because they buy the idea that the link between autism and vaccines was thoroughly debunked, and who are embarrassed by the anti-vaxxers.  People don't understand nuance and subtlety and yet that is where this all seems evident. Studies for safety can't possibly look at the long term effects, and they would have a hell of a time measuring and recording any subtle effects that even people who experience them sometimes can't be sure they feel. And so all that subtle stuff gets washed away.  Anyway, thanks again for your comment. I really appreciate it. I hope more people wake up to this. It doesn't mean we have to be anti vax, it doesn't mean we believe in conspiracies, it just means we want a truly open discussion about the real benefits and risks of all of these things we have just accepted.  I mean the proliferation of plastic alone is another one. How on earth can we possibly measure the full effect of these plastics on us when there aren't really ever acute effects of them? We can't, and then 60 years after they become the way we package all our food, after it became what we put our lips on to drink all our fluids, when we use it for cutting boards, cutlery, straws... how to we catch the culprit if people aren't just keeling over dead using the stuff? We can't.",MikeyPh,2025-04-25T16:15:23,3
Fr the symptoms are soooo wide that I could self-diagnose myself with atleast 10 diffrent illnesses after an extra rough work day. Atleast in the US they don't get the insane benefits they get here in Europe (those are being erased though thank God).,snusboi,2025-04-25T09:58:18,4
