Trump Slump.  Can't get past the pic of this evil parasite asleep with drooling mouth at our Late Pope's Funeral.  Let's raise a glass to Charon today as we celebrate the end of Hitlerism's Founder 80 years ago.,Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-30T04:02:12,4

"A reporter should point out to Lutnick (who claims that a secret trade agreement has already been negotiated with a nation that he won't name) that Trump's first administration needed **2 1/2 years** to put together the USMCA with Canada and Mexico.    And that was just a revision of an existing agreement (NAFTA), not a completely new agreement.  These things never happen in days.  They are far too complicated, plus the approval processes are lengthy.    A reporter should also remind Lutnick that he is going to own the stench of these lies and idiotic assertions long after Trump his gone.  Lutnick's own personal legacy is torpedoed.  Anyone who gets heavily involved in Trump comes to eventually regret it.",I405CA,2025-04-30T07:26:38,1
