"Are they even ""illegals?"" All I see them doing is going after folks who are coming here the right way. People with student visas, people who are arrested at their immigration meetings, people who work hard and want a great future. I have not noticed a drop in drug trafficking. Oh shit! Eggs are expensive!",smedlap,2025-04-27T18:27:01,1

"Given ICEs track record, I believe the headline should read ""nearly 800 alleged immigrants""  Also telling its ""immigrants"" as a whole, not ""illegal immigrants""...so it seems a foregone conclusion they already know ICE arrested people they shouldnt be arresting",VanguardAvenger,2025-04-27T20:50:54,1

"This point isn’t hammered enough, especially here in Florida where so many immigrants voted for Trump. Your status as a documented, legal resident makes you the easiest target. They know where and how to find you. They know when is best to detain you. You are the current “other” they frightened you into voting against.   Consider the immense resources that would have to be spent to actively track, confirm, and detain suspected undocumented immigrants. The documents folks are the easiest pool of targets.",the_sylince,2025-04-27T22:49:01,1

"interesting stats on that here: https://immigrationimpact.com/2021/07/30/ice-deport-us-citizens/  By that articles estimate,.. probably at least 10.
