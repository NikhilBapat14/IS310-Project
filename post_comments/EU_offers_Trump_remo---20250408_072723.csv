And... Trump rejects the offer.    This isn't about how the world is screwing us. This is about Trump and his need of power. ,Lebarican22,2025-04-08T07:28:06,94
Cool.  Thanks!  Too bad dummy Donnie and his gang of idiots don't understand trade balances and tariffs.,90Carat,2025-04-08T07:38:10,25

"Not very smart.  I understand what the EU is doing, but caving to Trump isn't going to work.  Trump is a mob boss who isn't interested in free or fair trade...he'll just move the goalposts and ask for more.  His only interests are fulfilling his boss' plan and getting richer and more powerful in the process.",Pretty_Boy_Bagel,2025-04-08T07:34:38,32
"If I understand correctly, the industrial tariffs are about 1.6%.  So, basically the EU is offering something they had offered to do in trump's first term, just to give trump the appearance of a victory, but in a way that really won't move the needle",AdAccomplished6870,2025-04-08T10:19:32,7
Conceding to Trump simply guarantees he’ll come back for more. It doesn’t take much to shut him down. Just refuse and ignore.  Concessions have the effect of locking in the trend. It’s creating the perception that he’s going to get away with continuously tightening the screws.,figuring_ItOut12,2025-04-08T11:05:55,6
"Trump is more concerned about the Trade Deficit. Yes, we import a lot of Trade Goods, but I believe we export more in Consumer Services, a non-tangible item. How he put Tariffs and Trade deficits together, you’d have to as his Expert, Peter Navarro or Navarro’s alter ego.",Koren55,2025-04-08T09:25:31,4
"I thought it just said EU was offering to remove Trump, which would be nice. It really feels like he's laying thr foundation for an overthrow of the democracy... again.",WarLawck,2025-04-08T09:19:28,3
"Why are you trying to play nice with him. Every country should just say they're stopping shipping to and from US and imports immediately until tarrifs are removed. That will crash US market in a day, and by day 2 or 3, he will be probably forced out or voted out in congress and all tarrifs would be lifted. Just need to stay strong for a few days. It's not like the ships from and to US with stuff would actually stop on their ways.",KathyJaneway,2025-04-09T01:58:12,1
He wants a payoff. One of his minions said they could just deposit money into the US treasury.   Aka he’s grifting. Again.,Federal_Drummer7105,2025-04-08T07:32:03,47
> And... Trump rejects the offer.   They offered what he wanted and he then upped his demands. Typical mob boss behavior. More details:  http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-eu-must-buy-350b-of-us-energy-to-get-tariff-relief/,wenchette,2025-04-08T07:36:38,27

The EU was already kinda planning to scrap these tarrifs as is.  Might as well offer something you were already kinda debating getting rid of anyways. That way its one less actual concession.,AsstacularSpiderman,2025-04-08T08:53:24,2
"The EU is ready to impose tariffs on US consumer services (ex: software,Netflix, Amazon cloud) but they keep this nuclear option (called anti-coercition instrument) on hold for now.",_lechiffre_,2025-04-08T10:24:00,2
