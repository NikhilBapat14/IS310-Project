">championed by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, etc.   Funfact, none of those people are considered to be actually Neoconservatives by experts (though Cheney and Rumsfeld are allied).  And they are still a thing in the GOP, but are no longer the dominate Foreign Policy group and have been mostly on the defensive since Trump has taken over.",Naliamegod,2022-08-09T21:27:45,5
"It was arguably only made relevant by the 11 September attacks; during the 2000 presidential debates, [Bush ran as an isolationist who would roll back the Clinton era interventionism](https://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci179/ABCNEWS_com%20%20Bush,%20Gore%20Spar%20Politely%20in%20Second%20Debate.htm) (which became unpopular due to combat deaths in Somalia and other places). The administration then leaned heavily on the security state for a public response to the terror attacks, which proved both unsuccessful and unpopular, which further discredited internationalism to both the right and the left.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-08-10T13:19:25,3
"Trumpism has definitely changed the party. Increasingly the focus is on social and cultural warfare issues that neo-cons mostly bowed to public opinion about. The Bush-era immigration policy was much kinder and focused way less on nativism. Overall, the general ""America-first"" consensus is very much counter to neo-con ideas.  Don't get me wrong, there are still some neo-cons in the party. Cheney would be an obvious one. But also she is facing an uphill battle for re-election because she has challenged the Trumpy parts of the party and the fact that she's losing that fight so clearly is a good snapshot of the relationship between neo-conservative and MAGA values in the Rep party.",mormagils,2022-08-11T08:58:25,2
"Yes-ish though it depends what you mean by ""neo-con.""  The popular usage of the term speaks to a kind of systemic conservatism - the idea that things need work but by applying conservative principles you can reform institutions and reshape them to function better. Small government is a part of it but it's not a *central* part of it.   It's fairly prevalent among a lot of the old guard of the Republican party.  What it lacks is a populist element and the degree of antagonism towards state institutions that we see with the rising right-wing populism. There isn't this impulse to slash and burn through the state.  That sort of philosophy is having a harder time fitting in with the base of the party, the term ""neocon"" is *kind of* an insult now (Alex Jones has used it as such for decades) especially when lobbed by more right libertarians.   The shift towards a quasi-libertarian populism has meant that what we might have called neo-conservatism is hitting a lot less than it used to but that might not *necessarily* be a bad thing from the Republican perspective.  A lot of the magic of neo-conservatism was to take concepts that were otherwise fairly unpalatable at the time and give them a new coat of paint so people would accept them. Things like abolishing large sections of the government weren't really in vogue among a lot of the Republican base until ~the 80's and 90's but you still had ideologues who wanted to get rid of or at least severely hamper things like state education, the IRS, etc.  But that didn't really fly in the 80's and 90's. That was the purview of really out there libertarians, people like Ron Paul, and it was just a bit *gauche* for mainstream Republicans.   Now that this sort of populist libertarianism has taken root in the party, the soft sell of neo-conservatism may not really be necessary anymore. At least not to the degree that it was back then.",HeloRising,2022-08-11T04:11:14,1
"It is virtually impossible to say neoconservatism has left the GOP.   The entire premise of neoconservatism is that regime change is a policy unto itself for dealing with other states - and that the easiest way to carry out that policy is through an invasion. There is simply no way to regard the Trump administration's policies and actions towards Iran and [Venezuela](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-choice-venezuela-failed-take-iran-1523384) as anything other than traditional neoconservative thinking - the idea that the only way to deal with those states is to topple their governments. It's a viewpoint that is still [echoed](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2012-01-01/time-attack-iran) by the Republican commentariat today. They still aren't even able to stomach the fact that A[fghanistan was never going to turn out how they wanted it to be.](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/joe-biden-doubles-down-on-afghanistan-betrayal/) There is very little difference between the foreign policy of the Bush and Trump administrations - aesthetics aside, Trump essentially put the same people in place, and a future Repub president would do the same.   Frankly anyone stating the GOP has left neoconservatism behind is probably trying to fool you.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-12T18:29:53,1
"They never really were a dominant Foreign Policy group so much as the only option on the table.  Republicans are primarily isolationist and view foreign policy through the lens of realpolitik. Traveling around the world to 'nation build' just isn't a natural outgrowth of their philosophy.  However, in the wake of 9/11, the neo-cons were the only ones pushing an agenda that could receive support from the public. The public demanded *something* be done, so the Administration couldn't just do nothing even when it would have been the right approach.  A good way to understand this would be to step back and consider what would should have done about airport security in the wake of 9/11. If you seriously think about it, the correct answer is 'nothing'. 9/11 was a one-time-only attack that depended on a policy of compliance initiated in the 70s in response to political hijackings where the passengers and crew merely got a vacation to Havana.  But even as events unfolded, this policy of compliance changed. Even with limited information and no formal guidance, the fourth plane rejected the policy of compliance. This made 9/11-style attacks impossible even without the government doing anything at all.  Unfortunately, politics isn't so much about rational policy as it is policy you can sell to the public - and the public almost never wants to hear that the proper government response is nothing rather than something.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-10T04:15:27,6

"I think the neocons lost power slowly with the passage of time. It was a long time coming and Trump just accelerated it.     In the early 2000s the party was electrified by it. The Republican base believed the WMD lies. In fairness many people did. They were convinced that the US military had to be in Afghanistan and Iraq to keep us safe.    They may have been uncomfortable with the Patriot Act but with 9/11 being so recent they thought it was justified to keep safe.    I just think that with the passage of time the shine started to come off that car.      Iraq had no WMD. For a long time people said it did. Now virtually no one thinks that Iraq had WMD or that the war was justified. Is common knowledge that the government lied.     Afghanistan is another thing. People thought we were helping a country get on its feet and keep us safe from terrorism. But over time we learned that what was actually happening was that we were spending billions of dollars, and losing people to help a deeply corrupt government in a war we had no hope of winning. For years the generals would say it’s getting better even as Taliban militants gained ground.    In 2019, the Washington Post published the Afghanistan Papers which showed the generals lied about the war for three administrations. It was a dud and didn’t cause much outrage. I think it was because everyone already knew the generals were lying. It was an open secret.",svaliki,2022-08-14T15:18:03,2
"> shift towards a quasi-libertarian populism  What shift?  Libertarian ideals in the Republican Party peaked around 2012 with the Tea Party and Ron Paul.  The current Republican Party is anything but libertarian.  The troubling authoritarian trend is basically the antithesis of libertarianism.  Fiscally, no Republican's uttered a peep about how much the deficit grew during the Trump administration, including Trump himself.",white_nerdy,2022-08-11T12:11:08,1
"Some strange arguments and leaps in logic here.  >They never really were a dominant Foreign Policy group so much as the only option on the table.  By definition the decisionmakers deciding foreign policy are the dominant foreign policy-making group. The neocons were the decisionmakers. They were the dominant foreign policy-making group. It doesn't particularly matter if there were non-Neocons in the GOP that held a different view - they weren't in the White House or the Pentagon. They had no power, ergo they were not the dominant view.   >Republicans are primarily isolationist and view foreign policy through the lens of realpolitik.  No Republican administration has used anything close to 'realpolitik' since 1993 (at best, and even then some people would disagree). Furthermore plenty of foreign policy is made on the basis of realpolitik that isn't isolationist - many would aactually argue those two concepts are in opposition to one another.  Regardless, it simply isn't true to say Republicans 'primarily' view foreign policy through realpolitk if the last two Republican administrations haven't.   >However, in the wake of 9/11, the neo-cons were the only ones pushing an agenda that could receive support from the public. The public demanded something be done, so the Administration couldn't just do nothing even when it would have been the right approach.     Some deeply problematic framing here. There is a wide spectrum of actions between 'nothing' and 'invading Iraq on a false pretext and embroiling the United States in two unwinnable wars for 20+ years.' The public was not clamoring for neoconservatism - it was ultimately sold to them as a (false) solution to their problems. The Bush administration could just as easily ousted the Taliban and al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, said 'There we go, done, you're safe,' and NOT invade Iraq. Instead it sold the public the idea that regime change could turn Afghanistan and Iraq into liberal democracies. Then it tried that. The pubic wasn't clamoring for that immediately after 9/11 - SOMETHING had to be done, but that almost certainly didn't have to be what the neoconservatives championed. To portray the neoconservatives' ultimate endgame of invading Iraq, Afghanistan, and starting the Global War on Terror as something inevitable and taking their agency out of it is just plain odd and severely misunderstands the policy process at that time.   >9/11 was a one-time-only attack that depended on a policy of compliance initiated in the 70s in response to political hijackings where the passengers and crew merely got a vacation to Havana.  That was a formal policy by the airline, then? Source? Far more important than this policy would be the organization and funding behind al-Qaeda, in any case.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-12T18:21:53,2
"Thank Murray Rothbard for bastardizing ""libertarianism"" into an Americanized version of it that's basically ""small government for me but not for thee."" It's a mental space that allows for a seemingly antagonistic idea of wanting stricter government control over some things but *no* government control over others.  I mean, libertarianism itself tends to be a self-contradictory ideology so I don't really think the Republican's flirting with rank authoritarianism is particularly off-brand.   >What shift? Libertarian ideals in the Republican Party peaked around 2012 with the Tea Party and Ron Paul.  Ehhh no. Ron Paul was always a pretty fringe figure and Rand Paul has only managed to stay relevant by being super annoying to his cohorts and leveraging himself into places he isn't wanted. Bolton was thoroughly annoyed at Rand Paul for doing this throughout Bolton's tenure.  The Tea Party movement spiked and then pretty quickly cratered but it wasn't anything like what we're seeing now. A lot of what was espoused by the Tea Party movement would be considered fairly standard Republican rhetoric now and even a little tame.   They were arguing for (among many things) a repeal of the 16th amendment and a new amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Now that's almost quaint when you have a large bloc of the Republican base advocating for axing whole sectors of the federal government like the Department of Education, Energy, the IRS, the Federal Reserve, etc. Those talking points were around in 2012-ish but they were not talked about by serious people involved in government openly in public.  John Bolton was appointed to be the US representative to the UN and he openly stated the US shouldn't even be a part of the UN and that was considered blasphemy enough to run him back to the private sector. Under Trump a number of people appointed to departmental positions were openly hostile to the departments they were heads of and that went pretty much without serious pushback.  I'm not saying that this libertarian populism is *new,* but it has a prominence and a mainstream Republican acceptability that it just didn't have before.",HeloRising,2022-08-12T01:55:03,2
