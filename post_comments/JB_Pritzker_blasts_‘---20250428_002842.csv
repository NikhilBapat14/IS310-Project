It would be funny if it were not so dire of circumstances... also it would be dismissible if anyone other than Bernie were trying to rally and spread any kind of message. Fuck tyrants and autocrats and oligarchs. Power to the people.,N23EX,2025-04-28T01:16:05,10

What is a party with minority voting numbers in both houses supposed to do?

"Kamala and Tim went with Liz Cheney to try to turn Republican voters into Democratic voters, and received hell on earth from Redditors. Bernie and AOC go into Republican strongholds to try to woo Republican voters, and Reddit says the mainstream democrats should have been doing that, which they were. What’s the difference?  Hint: I know what the difference is, I just want to hear what Redditors think when confronted with this double standard.",gilockwood,2025-04-28T02:12:44,8
"They should be doing literally whatever AOC and Bernie is doing. Invigorate their voterbase, keep receipts, and make sure Republicans are blasted and held accountable for every single thing that they've enabled Trump to do. That's literally it.",Morbu,2025-04-28T01:12:35,16
Every democratic member of congress should be assigned a shadow district held by a Republican. They should be in that district listening and talking to voters until they introduce the person running against the current member of Congress.   They should be obstructing the flow of legislation in every way possible.  They should be talking to Republican colleagues (particularly the Senators who have decades long relationships with some Republicans) and finding ways to limit executive power.,BeeSuspicious3493,2025-04-28T01:52:57,9
"Democrats don't have functional power but they've by and large failed to be an opposition party that feels like it's standing up for the people who didn't vote for this madness. They can be loud, be disruptive, and have clear and concise messaging that speaks to their voters.   Right now a lot of them feel completely absent and seem content to just wait things out or let citizens fight for them. This isn't to say this applies to everyone as there have been some Democrats willing to call things out and take action but it still feels like a minority.",Orange8920,2025-04-28T01:32:18,9

"I understand the minority voters aspect. What I don't understand are things like Schumer not fighting the continuing resolution at all. That was the only leverage they had to try and prevent some of this and they just rolled over completely.   While they may not have the votes at the moment there are still a number of things they should be doing. AOC and Bernie are good examples of what every Democrat should be doing. They are going around and being vocal about what is happening and trying to push back. They are rallying their base for support as well as trying to bring people to their side. We've seen the damage caused from only a few months of this administration, imagine what they could accomplish in 2 years. Waiting until the mid-terms is not acceptable. Even if they think they may not have the numbers I think they should still try for an impeachment and removal. It feels as if they're giving up without even trying.  The President is a felon with an incompetent and dangerous administration. They have done more than enough to deserve being removed from their positions. Everyone should be beholden to the law and their oath of office and currently they aren't being held accountable by the people who actually have the power to do so.",CarolinaBat,2025-04-28T04:10:16,2
"> What is a party with minority voting numbers in both houses supposed to do?   The answer is always ""i don't know, just do something""... been thrown around for some decades with out any clear, or concise answers. Why? Its a line usually levied by complete morons, or those arguing in bad faith.   (Edit: My favorite is when they parrot back a list of ""must/should do"" and its what is being done already... like really...)  >From an outside observer perspective, it appears people are partially blaming those not in power for what those in power are doing.  Yes, and more often than not the ones doing so push other propaganda talking points at the benefit of those in power... as an example, ""Biden old"", but then refusing to address the fact that Trump is just as old and twice as senile.   None of any of that involves good faith rhetoric of any kind.",Competitive_Oil_649,2025-04-28T02:23:29,2

"Kamala & Tim said, ""You're right, but too much. You don't need fascism, we need more milquetoast neoliberalism to fix this country"".  Bernie & AOC are saying, ""You're right, your intuition that the system is broken & you are being exploited IS correct, and real, radical change is needed.""  It's not the same message. Saying, ""no, not like that"" is pretty reasonable.",Jessika_Thorne,2025-04-28T07:06:44,7
I think the town halls in Red strongholds are getting under their skin.  Some Rep in a Red district is taking a Blue colleague to the ethics committee.[Tom Emmer Ethics Complaint](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/minnesota/news/tom-emmer-house-ethics-investigation-angie-craig-town-halls/),AnnabananaIL,2025-04-28T07:21:53,2

You won't find me among the people that thought talking to Republicans in 2024 was a bad idea.  I'm saying democrats should double down on that.  High profile figures and election years aren't enough. Democrats that most people have never heard of should be talking to Republicans districts right now.   There is a lot to be gained by removing standard Democratic language and phrasing things differently.  Democratic messaging sucks. Republicans have dialed in their messaging for decades.,BeeSuspicious3493,2025-04-28T02:42:59,3
I'm referring to the amount of Democrats who seem like they're doing something in addition to their congressional powers which is still a small amount. They don't have the power to pass legislation or put a check on the executive branch but there's still other ways they can fight.,Orange8920,2025-04-28T01:54:17,5
