"Let me be an ""expert""... with almost 50 years in manufacturing (machining).   When I started in 1977... I was ""the kid"" in the shop. Ten years later... I was still ""the kid"" in the shop. I noticed that others younger than me were not getting into the trade. Each shop I went to from that point on... my coworkers were all my age or older. When I retired, I was doing aerospace nc programming. Our office had 7 nc programmers... we were all near retirement age. On the shop floor setting up and running the machines... mostly immigrants or sons of immigrants - who did fantastic work.  In those almost 50 years... I had to change job locations 20 times. Why? To get increases in pay. What you come in with is what you leave with except for a few small COL increases in some shops. The hours are long. Most shops run min 10 hours a day with 12 being not uncommon. The goal is to have a 24 hour production cycle with minimum breaks. The old 3 shifts went out the window because of the ""cost"" of the required 3 lunches and multiple rest breaks, plus the start and stop overlap which slows production.   Automation and robotics has really taken off reducing the need for a large workforce if you have standardized production. So the large shops in the 80's that required 300 employees... Now only require 100. So don't expect the ""onshoring"" of manufacturing to make a huge impact on employment.",williamgman,2025-05-05T13:50:04,14

"The article includes a chart titled ""someone's American dream, just not mine"", illustrating the big disconnect between people who want there to *be* manufacturing jobs vs. who want to *work* those jobs:  > The most obvious place to start is with what Americans think about manufacturing jobs. Cato’s 2024 globalization survey explored this very thing and found that while about 80 percent of Americans thought the nation would be better off with more manufacturing jobs, few of those same respondents—around 25 percent—actually wanted to work in a factory themselves. Thus, as my Cato colleague Colin Grabow wrote last year, “Americans love the idea of people working in manufacturing, but most don’t think they would benefit from such work themselves.”  > Protectionists nevertheless seized on these data—which recently went viral after being featured in the Financial Times—to argue that there’s a massive pent-up demand for more manufacturing work, since just around 8 percent of the U.S. workforce today is employed in the sector but 25 percent of respondents wanted such work. But these claims fail for two big reasons.  > The first is that they simply misread and overstated the poll results. AEI’s Scott Winship dug into the data and found several reasons to question the protectionists’ main conclusion. For example, around the same share of homemakers, students, and permanently disabled respondents expressed a preference for factory work as did full-time workers—a clear indication that said preference isn’t real or, at least, very strong. (Unemployed workers had a stronger preference, but that’s to be expected and we unfortunately didn’t ask about taking a job in another industry.) The full-timers, in fact, had a “strong potential interest” in manufacturing employment just a bit more (1.6 times) than the actual share of said workers currently employed at a factory. Thus, even respondents’ stated preference for manufacturing work in the abstract—i.e., just what they tell pollsters they want in response to a single, vague question—isn’t clear or overwhelming at all.  > Even more importantly, however, is Americans’ revealed preference—i.e., what they’re actually doing in today’s U.S. labor market—for manufacturing work. And here there’s little evidence of a strong interest among most American workers, whether employed or sitting at home. As Winship notes, for example, there are almost 500,000 job openings in the U.S. manufacturing sector today, and they’ve actually been getting more common relative to overall manufacturing employment since the Great Recession...",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-05T13:30:10,7
"Deep leftist here. I find myself in agreement with the Cato here. Why would you trade IT and banking jobs for manufacturing. Are you really thinking we can compete with Vietnam where annual incomes are 5k per year? In the end, we should be looking for the next generation of jobs and not the ones from two generations ago. This is the problem with old people running the world.",Pretend_Pea4636,2025-05-05T13:43:20,6

"Manufacturing is not coming back to the US in a massive way. Not like what Trump wants. Biden created over 800k manufacturing jobs in electric vehicle batteries, solar and wind components, and other parts of the growing clean energy economy. Trump is stopping all this.  The cheap products China makes can not be made here. We do not have the labor force needed to work low-paying jobs needed to make these products, they would cost a fortune. *In China, the average salary for a factory worker is around CNY 58,893 per year, or CNY 28 per hour. This equates to approximately USD 8,231 per year, or USD 3.92 per hour.*  Who in the US is willing to take on a job at 3.92 per hour? Don jr? Ivanka? Eric? Barron? Barron should be ready for his first job...right?",SAJ-13,2025-05-05T15:47:12,3
"Another issue is Walmart is actively integrating robots and AI into its U.S. operations, particularly in distribution centers and supply chain logistics. The company has invested heavily in automation to enhance efficiency and reduce physical strain on workers.... or so they say. I think we can mostly agree that robots replacing humans means 24/7 operations, no overtime, no holiday leave, won't have to pay health insurance, retirement, taxes, etc.  We don't see much news on this, especially not mainstream, but I don't think manufacturing jobs coming to the US are meant for humans.",Luzion,2025-05-05T13:38:36,2
"Ahh, the Cato institute.  Let me get this out of the way first.  We told you so you arrogant libertarian knuckle heads. This is in part your fault!   So now we have to be on the same side fighting the dumb fight against Trump's insane tariffs.  Good luck trying to convince the MAGA crowd. You might actually be able to get a few to listen, but I won't hold my breath.   And, please try and remember that we were right next time.",thepartypantser,2025-05-05T15:35:03,1

"> Why would you trade IT and banking jobs for manufacturing.   Who wants to see that other than Trump and magas who don't understand why Trump's plan is so insanely stupid?   In any case there's zero chance that Trump's tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs on any significant scale. No company is going to invest the money to build out a factory and resolve all the supply chain issues and try to hire enough workers, etc., when Trump will probably flip flop again before the ink on the blue prints is dry.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-05T13:56:54,5

"Wouldn't the ability of manufacturers to sell the product at a higher cost, due to tariffs allow them to pay for staff at a higher rate?",mastersurrealist,2025-05-06T01:02:34,1
"If you use tariffs to make the Chinese products more expensive wouldn't that allow domestic manufacturers to charge enough to pay staff more? Edit: Not saying they're going to, but the funds from the tariffs could be used to fund the infrastructure needed to build these manufacturing plants. ",mastersurrealist,2025-05-06T01:03:58,1
