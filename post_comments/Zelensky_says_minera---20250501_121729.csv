"Nobody even knows if Ukraine has any valuable minerals anyway. Might as well take away Trump's talking points.  ""Yeah, dude. Come investigate all our massive mineral stuff! Bring your army to protect your corporate people!""",0002millertime,2025-05-01T12:18:46,7
I read from somewhere that most of those minerals are in Russian controlled lands.... are the US sending troops to remove them? Or keep pumping Ukraine with weapons until they retake?   What's the plan exactly here because didn't Trump said he would withdraw from negotiation?,wizgset27,2025-05-01T12:20:28,3
"I trust President Z.  He's kept Donald on a leash for months and been a great leader for his country.  The US offered to evacuate him when Russia invaded.  His response was he needed ammunition, not a ride.  Ask if Donald would do the same and try not to laugh.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-01T12:34:45,4
