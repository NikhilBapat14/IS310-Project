"Yes, exactly!  Whether you are a judge or an elected official if you break the law you are subject to arrest. Isn‚Äôt that how the legal system SHOULD work?",swanspank,2025-05-09T20:44:15,303
"Liberals always scream ""rule of law!"" when it comes to conservatives or Trump. But they don't care about the rule of law when it comes to liberal college kids burning up schools. Or liberal arsonists during the 2020 riots. They don't care about the rule of law when they say that the CEO killer should be released. They don't care about the rule of law when they laugh about Tesla dealerships being fire bombed. They don't care about the rule of law when they see American citizens having to pay $500 deductibles because their Tesla was damaged by liberals. They don't care.",BossJackson222,2025-05-09T20:53:08,130

Well it was a publicity stunt essentially and he clearly wanted to get arrested so that he could get it filmed.  They plan to provoke a reaction and then they claim that the reaction that they knew would happen is an injustice.  Democrat activism 101.,OzoneLaters,2025-05-10T02:28:01,125

"He was outside a federal detention facility that had plenty of signs and actual guards warning him he would be arrested. He knew exactly what he was doing. He even waited for all the cameras and crew.  He then illegally stormed (very Jan 6th like) the location and was immediately arrested exactly like they had been telling him.   He claimed he was doing an ""oversight visit.""  It was all for show. Now he has pics of being arrested. The left is claiming these are the detention camps and every American is at risk.  The left has become a parody.",chances906,2025-05-09T22:58:50,43

Well the truly ironic and funny thing is that these completely corrupt leftists tried their absolute best to arrest donald trump who still ended up completely winning the 2024 USA presidential election by an absolute landslide despite the complete rigging from the completely corrupt leftists.,ENERGY-BEAT-ABORTION,2025-05-10T10:41:59,6
