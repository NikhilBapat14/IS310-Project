"Instead of focusing on the religious aspect of the Easter holiday or making sure that children enjoy their visit to the White House, Trump did what he always does - use this opportunity to inflate his own ego.",MobileWisdom,2025-04-24T05:41:36,58

TBH that is far better than the religious easter story. If you don't know....it's a gruesome tale and the biggest guilt trip ever. It's so unbelievable but yet grown adults still do. ,Key_Assistant_4813,2025-04-24T06:58:07,0

"Nah. I don’t believe the bullet went anywhere near his ear, but the assassination attempt was real. I think he got scuffed up while getting shoved to the ground by his security, and being an old man, his skins thin/fragile, so it grazed/tore. He’s probably on blood thinners too with his poor diet. Which would make it bleed more.",Steelhorse91,2025-04-24T08:13:38,3
