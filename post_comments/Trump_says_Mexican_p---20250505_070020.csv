"Considering the number of people she ran against were assassinated, that's not exactly an unfounded claim.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-05T09:02:40,194
"I mean, there is evidence that the cartels have some political clout and they can outgun the Mexican army, that fear isn't irrational.",MadGobot,2025-05-05T07:08:55,417
"I think anyone honest would admit that the Mexican Government is scared of the threat from the Cartels, and does not have adequate capability to keep them under control.",TexasPeteEnthusiast,2025-05-05T10:15:10,64
the cia won't let us get rid of the cartels for some odd reason. it's all a racket.,PatTheBatsFatNutsack,2025-05-05T12:28:34,28
I frankly don't blame her. I would be afraid too.,YesItIsAnAltAcc,2025-05-05T14:47:05,10
"Well yeah, if I'd stepped over the corpses of multiple assassinated candidates who said things the cartels dont like to get my office, I'd be scared too",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-05T10:58:41,22
"Their politicians are all speaking under duress and aren't able to be trusted on this matter. If America pulled an El Salvador on the cartels, they'd love it.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T12:25:33,6
It's a fair possibility. And a fear I wouldn't blame her for having. They're a *real* threat if they choose to go after her.,Haust,2025-05-05T14:21:52,4

"Nope, U.S. forces should not be in Mexico for a civil law enforcement operation .",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T07:44:44,139
"Afraid of - or in bed with? Mexico is a failed state, the cartels and the government are one and the same. You cannot be elected there unless the cartels allow it.   To say another way - in other news, water is wet.",Dead-as-a-Doornail,2025-05-05T10:01:49,30
She's probably owned by the cartels.,bw2082,2025-05-05T08:14:57,14
That's honestly valid. I'd be scared too,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-08T22:28:28,1
"She may not be afraid OF the cartel, but afraid FOR them.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-05T12:02:46,21
"No shit, I'd be scared of them too.",lankyevilme,2025-05-05T07:36:37,120
Agree wholeheartedly - but I think the real question is how much political clout the cartels really have.  Some believe that the cartels have infiltrated every level of the Mexican government with a mix of direct cash payments and/or threats of violence.,Freespeechaintfree,2025-05-05T07:42:32,71
"Right, but she got offered help from the biggest military power in the world... I understand shes scared, but she got offered a way out for her people. In that position you're supposed to put the people before yourself, but instead her cowardice and kickbacks showed.",Roudyrepublican,2025-05-05T19:00:31,5
A week ago she was promoting it. Now the opposite?,the445566x,2025-05-05T17:51:54,2
"Not just them, their families. People should go watch Somo on Netflix. These people are monsters. On the same level of evil as serial killers. It definitely needs to dealt with very carefully.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-05T12:29:23,15
"Mexican cartels are a bit beyond the scope of civil law enforcement. They regularly engage in political assassinations and have thrown Mexico into so much chaos in the past that their people elect soft-on-crime politicians because the act of trying to enforce the law against them is more destructive than letting them run roughshod over the country. They actively threaten or bribe US politicians, judges, and law enforcement and are a potent international threat. It really seems like you're burying your head in the sand on this.",Brilliant-Diver8138,2025-05-05T10:21:36,81
Cartels are a direct threat to the United States. What if Hamas was active in Mexico? Is that what it would take for you to intervene?,Total_Decision123,2025-05-05T09:01:32,60
I suppose that would depend on how in bed she is with them.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-05T13:25:32,10
I know of (through a documentary series of interviews) a US undercover operation going after cartel money laundering that was called off when a high level Mexican official was implicated.,MadGobot,2025-05-05T07:44:49,56
"The Colombian cartels had everyone on the payroll, even the president at one point. Nothing would surprise me in Mexico.",Material-Afternoon16,2025-05-05T11:23:55,15
The US government as well. Not the Mexican cartels but the mob took over large parts of the government. I would not be surprised if they hold the majority of institutional power in most countries.,day25,2025-05-05T12:56:20,7
"I get your point, but military power isn't always able to prevent a secretary from using a Derringer, a caterer from poisoning your food, etc. I get your point, but it is a rational fear.",MadGobot,2025-05-05T19:02:23,5
"Nope. There are VERY good reasons for not having our military involved in civilian law enforcement actions.  We have had them in support roles (ISR, transportation, etc.) for years.  Deploying troops across the border is reminiscent of Pershing and the Punitive Expedition.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T11:04:57,-21
"What it would take is a formal SOFA with Mexico AND a formal declaration of “war” by Congress.  Declaring “war” on a non-national entity is like declaring a “war” on poverty, drugs, or social injustice.  There is a reason we have the Posse Comitatus Act.  Even in Mexico, collateral deaths and injuries put our armed forces in danger of foreign prosecution, detainment, etc.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T09:16:22,38
She’s breathing. So that bed is pretty full.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-05T14:15:53,15
El Salvador too. President Bukele had to do a cleansing going all the way to the top. It seems that he had to be pretty ruthless.,lady_wolfen,2025-05-05T19:54:38,9
"I agree. It is rational. I guess I just would like to believe that in that situation, integrity would overcome, but I'm not in that situation nor do I honestly know what I would do because I'm not the one in it.",Roudyrepublican,2025-05-05T19:06:11,8
"That's orthogonal to my point and Pershing's expedition is hardly substantial enough to amount to a geopolitical rule of thumb or justification for your particular misapplication of posse comitatus, as posse comitatus concerns domestic law enforcement.",Brilliant-Diver8138,2025-05-05T11:17:34,20
"> a formal declaration of “war” by Congress  'Yesterday, December 7th, 1941-a date that will live in infamy'  Yeah, let's wait for the next Pearl Harbor while Congress twiddles their thumbs.",vampirepomeranian,2025-05-05T09:56:12,8
Cartels are terrorists.  The only negotation with terrorists is that done at the end of a gun.  Who is holding the gun is the question.,RossBot5000,2025-05-06T01:33:40,3
"And the situation you describe; criminal gangs in another sovereign nation.   A criminal, not national defense correlation.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T14:23:16,-12
"The executive branch has more than enough power to avoid that situation again, which is why the President can deploy troops up to 180 days without congressional approval.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T11:02:42,10
But you previously stated intervention requires congressional approval.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-05T14:26:34,3
"That is the constitution and congressional delegation of their war power. Yes, and so if the President wishes to deploy the armed forces he may do so up to 180 days (it has 90 days for demobilization, etc.).  I stand by my first statement; if the President wishes to deploy troops; he should make his case and execute; he and his cabinet had better already have the necessary votes for a declaration ready. If they do not pass it, the political fallout would be a disaster.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T15:08:30,2
"Deploying troops to fight against a narco-country whose law and military enforcement has been compromised, using murder and political payoffs to facilitate distribution of drugs that's killed untold number of Americans, turns a blind eye to murderers and rapists crossing the border to sew their destruction, dealing in sex trade and smuggling operations including children in my books carries absolutely no political risk.  Trump could do this tomorrow without repercussions.",vampirepomeranian,2025-05-05T15:49:01,4
"Well, we may see soon.",boundpleasure,2025-05-05T15:52:09,1
