"This has been really hard on vets across NATO as well. I'm a Canadian vet, and we're all wondering how we went from side by side in Afghanastan for 20 years to being threatened with invasion",GiftedOaked,2025-05-02T08:45:00,83
"Marine corps 08-12, here. Thank you for getting out there. Been fighting for 9 years to wake people up and rid us of the cancer. I have a very similar size/setup banner that I recycle messages on and post up over the interstate for tens of thousands of cars to see. This week, impeach and remove now. Next, remember your oath. 🇺🇸✊",Andrew_Codes_,2025-05-02T09:44:13,39

"In August 2001, Trump changed his party affiliation to Democratic. In September 2009, he changed his party affiliation back to the Republican Party. In December 2011, Trump changed to ""no party affiliation"" (independent). In April 2012, he again returned to the Republican Party what a hypocrite is like saying one day I am a blood the next day a crap.",Short_Seesaw_940,2025-05-09T16:03:14,1

"Right.  Apparently hundreds of thousands of Canadians being killed or wounded fighting with Americans and then turning around and stabbing them in the back means absolutely nothing to MAGA.  The arrogance of these people is absolutely breathtaking.  This movement appeals to only the most base, ignorant and resentful elements in the population.  You’ve got to be in a very dark place on a personal level to support this nonsense.",Due-Yard-7472,2025-05-02T16:21:07,8

That is entirely foolish. But you can't learn anything new if everything you post is the hill you are willing to die on. People like you will end the Democratic party.,MadMaxBeyondThunder,2025-05-02T12:27:26,-9

Lol.  You know that thing that NFL kickers do for an extra point after a touchdown. Think of that with the resulting undercarriage discomfort for men. They gave me a warning for saying they deserve that,OceanBlueforYou,2025-05-03T02:13:49,1
