"Let's be clear. Former CBS CEO Les Moonves famously said during Trump's first term, ""This may not be good for America... But it's great for CBS!"" at a shareholder meeting. ""This is fun!""... Let that sink in.",williamgman,2025-05-07T09:36:06,40
The settlement is more of a bribe rather than compensation for wrongdoing since Trump gets to decide whether or not the Paramount-Skydance merger goes through.,mkt853,2025-05-07T09:36:06,16

"Is there a legitimately ethical big business that the liberal public can stand behind? We show support by shopping there, they use their big money to throw trump around a little. Big business has several cons, but if we team up, maybe big business can fight back. Politicians listen to corporate.",catnipdealer16,2025-05-07T15:37:36,2
"Speak in language they understand. You will return more value to the shareholders if you do not give in. If you pay the mafia once, well, you're going to keep paying them for a very long time because now they know, they've got you in their pocket.  It won't end with just once. It isn't cheaper to pay them off, and appeasement doesn't ***ever*** work. Once he knows he can push you around, the bully will always be in your backyard - looking to get some more lebensraum.",yebyen,2025-05-07T15:53:59,2
"One thing about the current situation is true colors of people are shining through, while the performative gestures fade away. We get to see what happens when these institutions that have for decades claimed to be defenders of the American way of light come into contact with fascism.  \- Corporations, supposed defenders of the free market - They gave in before it even got hard. They rolled out the red carpet for fascism. Not much of a surprise, but for years they acted like they were on ""our"" side with these ""progressive"" initiatives. I guess they thought we didn't mean it as much as they didn't, but at least Target and Tesla are FO.  \- Liberals - I looooove that liberals turned out to be exactly who leftists said they were. We said: when the time comes, liberals will side with fascists over progressives, because that's who corporations will side with, and liberals always side with corporations. And here we are! It's AOC and Bernie begging 60 minutes in this story, not liberals. And that's because liberals are fascists lite. They want what fascism brings, but they don't want to have to do what ""has to be done"" to get there. You know, the ""final solution"" stuff doesn't sit right with them, but they're happy to look the other way, and to prevent anything from being fixed that would stop the final solution. MLK called it.  \- Media, supposed defenders of free speech - clammed up and turned themselves into propaganda outfits. Worried more about their access than defending out country. ""Democracy dies in darkness"" indeed.  \- The arts, supposed defenders of freedom of expression - true artists are standing up and pushing back. But celebrity ""artists"" like Snoop Dogg are happy to go where they think the popular culture is no matter how depraved it is. We see you \*Calvin\*.  \- The Court, supposed defends of the rule of law - when Trump came to high profile law firms they protected their bottom line first. They rolled over and asked what they could do to facilitate fascism. We see pushback from other lawyers, but by and large I have been supremely disappointed in law professionals in this country. Aside from defending the law, they seem to think it's theirs to twist and turn to suit their ends. The ""Greenbay Push"" initiative during the attempt to steal the 2020 election was conceived and executed primarily by lawyers. Judges though have been standing firm and they remain the frontline of this current struggle.  \- Law enforcement, supposed enforcers of the law - no surprise here, these guys are exactly the jackbooted thugs we thought they were. They've been chomping at the bit for years to get the fascism started and now they are really showing they mean it. So bravo guys, way to live up to your expectations for once!  \- Academia, supposed defenders of science and truth - A mixed bag here. You have places like Columbia rolling over for Trump. DEI departments shuttered, foreign students expelled, because they're afraid of losing federal grant money. The initial reaction I think was very poor. But then Harvard stood up and a defense coalition formed, and I have much hope for academia to live up to their expectations going forward as people who will be at the forefront of the resistence, which is why they are being targeted so aggressively.  \- The Church, supposed defenders of the soul - completely abandoned any tether to morality and social justice. Whatever progress religious people think they've made over the years to win the hearts and minds of people is gone. Y'all are so bankrupt it strains credulity. I saw a meme that said ""Christians couldn't recognize idolators if they tweeted a picture of themselves as the Pope"" and I think that really sums it all up. Trump is the living embodiment of the 7 deadly sins, and his followers are actually violating all 10 commandments in order to continue worshipping him. He's the literal antichrist, according to \*their\* stupid book.  \- The Military, supposed defenders of the country - yeah we see how this is going. Led by a prima donna whose sole claim to fame is that he sits on a couch wearing makeup and gossips with his besties going around trying to ""man up"" the military. It's always been a cult, but now it's a MAGA cult. So what's in store for them in the future? 100% guarantee you they will be ordered to fire on US citizens and they will comply without a second thought. 100% it's going to happen just you wait and see. Probably over the summer, tensions rise, national guard with live ammo is called in, and they will be \*happy\* to kill a bunch of ""antifa"", no matter who they are or what they're doing. There's no even a question in my mind that's what will happen next.  And so here we are, one institution after another fallen, and we are left to beg 60 minutes of all people to like... not give in so easily. Not a lot of hope when every other US institution has already fallen so far.",FrostyMatters,2025-05-07T12:42:14,-1
"Maybe they shoupd be calling for their constituents to boycott paramount if they do. And not just paramount, but any company that bows down to trump. Oh, wait. I forgot that democrats are spineless opportunists. ",Bakedads,2025-05-07T10:39:23,-2

"Les Moonves was a sexist douchebag who sexually harassed assaulted women, refused to have any women starring shows, took down all pictures of former women powerhouse legends like Lucille Ball from CBS offices, and got women fired and shut down shoes if they talked about being harassed by other men.",Vio_,2025-05-07T13:19:39,7
"Yeah, if they don't, I think I'll have to get a subscription for a bit.   Not settling takes some stones when you're trying to pull off a merger.    And if they pay, Trump likely still will fuck them over to the best of his ability. Still, they'll certainly go for the path of least resistance. ",MurtaghInfin8,2025-05-07T15:31:10,3
