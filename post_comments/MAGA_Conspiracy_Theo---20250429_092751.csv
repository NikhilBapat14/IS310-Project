A vile rancid turd calling an orange turd putrid.  Interesting 🤔,shoppingfortruth,2025-04-29T09:33:23,74
Mr Jones life is in the shitter. Trump didn't bail him out. So now he's taking the other side on this one. He still believes in gay frogs.,williamgman,2025-04-29T09:49:05,66
Didn't have this one on my bingo card.,TheFrostyCrab,2025-04-29T09:34:01,51
"He flip flops on Trump pretty frequently, y’all. I think my favorite moment from the first term was when Jones said Trump “shoved ISIS up his dirty asshole” in a tirade, and then was back to bootlicking like a day later. As always with AJ, it’s for attention.",codyashi_maru,2025-04-29T11:14:49,15
"The problem of presidential power overreach, is that everyone would be affected. The GOP is more scared than the dems. Reason being even though Trump will go after dems for sure, but dems stick together and can seek help and fight together.  The RINO, aka people that's on the right that don't believe in Trump; they are the most vulnerable to Trump attack.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-29T09:39:59,18
"If Alex had just kept his path, kept saying the same things consistently without endorsing trump, and applied his own theories going into the trump admin, he may have actually met his cultural moment. Literally sold the bottom",rundmz8668,2025-04-29T10:15:17,16
Gosh. I thought that he'd already decomposed.,phosdick,2025-04-29T09:42:52,9
"frankly every person who is in a position that could be affected by deportations, who voted for trump, deserves everything that comes to them.  so many people i know hated trump, but bought into the idea that the democrats would ruin the economy(that they made strong?), and that trumps border security would be good.  they didnt care about anything else.  they were single issue voters.  ignored all the warning signs and drank the cool-aid.  now they begin to complain that trump is doing things he promised to do all along, while somehow making things waay worse in just about every way.  I even have family to still claims to hate trump, when his tariffs are possibly ruining their job(and mine), yet they think kamala would have somehow been worse despite a GOP controlled congress and conservative court.. in their mind somehow everything would have been worse.  they dont even realize how far down the maga hole they have fallen while trying to justify that the current problems are their fault(im told they voted independent and not for trump, but every vote away from kamala hurt in this case).   So for all of those people who didnt vote, not liking kamala and wanting to send a message.  for all those who were single issue voters and didnt think it would be this bad, well tough, you deserve everything comes to you.  this is the result of your own actions.  Thanks, you have ruined things for all of us.",VOIDsama,2025-04-29T10:25:15,3
"Oh, see that’s just because nothing really matters to Alex and he’ll say anything for money and fame. He was able to take that stance because he brought on Nick “Literally a Nazi” Fuentes as cover. He gets the benefit of this headline to draw a few eyeballs from normal folks while his audience gets to hear Alex raise their objections and provide some meaningless pushback when Nick lays out an answer to that.     It’s literally a two-man con game designed to sell the idea that Nazis are right and here’s the answer to your objections about morality/ethics/law",alphawhiskey189,2025-04-29T11:51:12,3

Fuck alex jones obviously    This is exactly the type of thing he and his kind has been scared would happen for decades and now its happening.  Honestly a little refreshing that he is saying it.     Again fuck alex jones,TheVoiceInZanesHead,2025-04-29T15:19:24,2

"A more naive and hopeful me may have been like ""You know shits bad when Alex Jones see that it's a real problem"". But I know now that Jones is just mad that everyone he helps boost into far-right stardom moves on and leaves him behind asap, like a used old cum-sock forgotten under the filthy dilapidated couch that is maga. Then, his only recourse to stay relevant is by talking shit about his ""allies"" to generate headlines like these.",WhenIWannabeME,2025-04-29T15:59:11,1

"I just figured it was par for the course. Trumps in power, Jones’ whole schtick is to claim those in power are evil or whatever. It’s the next logical step using his business model.

"Well that’s the thing though, as an agent of white supremacy and fascism, the conspiracy theories are just projection. It was and always will be assuming your enemy wants to do the things that you wish to do. I’ve been talking about how the trans panic is conservatives worried that liberals will do what christians did to indigenous people in residential schools. Cut their hair, change their language, eliminate their religion etc. We were founded by sea pirates and as Vonnegut said “The chief weapon of the sea pirates, however, was their capacity to astonish. Nobody else could believe, until it was much too late, how heartless and greedy they were.”",rundmz8668,2025-04-29T11:14:25,8
