"I would contact whichever entity supervises elections in that state and ask. [California's Secretary of State](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/frequently-asked-questions), [New York's Board of Elections](https://www.elections.ny.gov/FAQ.html).  [This article by the NCSL](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/double-voting.aspx) says that neither state expressly prohibits voting in another state (technically you aren't voting in the 'same election' multiple times but rather two state ones), and it also says no one has been prosecuted for voting in multiple states.  You may get better answers in either of the state subreddits or one of the US law-related subreddits.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-11-03T20:34:06,1
