"The consequences of all of those budget cuts that Hegseth has demanded are coming to fruition faster than I expected.   In short, the budget cuts are hitting maintenance and safety tasks, and that is quickly causing critical systems to break down.",code_archeologist,2025-05-07T09:33:08,5

"Wait, is this the second or third jet to fall off of a carrier? Paywalled article.",OrpheusV,2025-05-07T16:02:09,1
"I’m not really surprised. Carrier ops are possibly one of the most risky, dangerous, and complicated things humans do. These aircraft are normally kept in the air and on the boat by the Navy’s meticulous and high standards for safety and professionalism.   Safety and professionalism are inconsistent with the macho-man performative warrior aesthetic that the TV Host of Defense is going for. To them it’s all woke DEI stuff.",Violet-Journey,2025-05-07T20:56:57,1

They don't really need an excuse.  Hegseth has already told the Pentagon to draw down 20% of them.  Unstated in the official order I'm sure is to prioritize removing anyone with a backbone.,OkayComputer1701,2025-05-07T09:27:29,3
