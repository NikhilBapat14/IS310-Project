"The losing party would change its positions in order to be more competitive. Both parties have had to do that over the years- Republicans moderated after losing to FDR and Truman and accepted the existence of the New Deal and a social safety net more broadly, which they had been firmly opposed to. As a result, moderate Republicans like Eisenhower and Nixon were able to win the Presidency. After Reagan, Democrats led by Clinton and the Democratic Leadership Council moderated, largely on the generosity of the welfare state and trade, and brought the party back to competitiveness.   There are also times when even a major party entirely fails and something new forms in its place. That's really only happened once in American politics, with the Whigs. They had a lot of idiosyncratic views that no voters really cared strongly about, like Presidential vs Congressional power, insisting that the President should merely facilitate what Congress decided to do, which was in essence a 'vote for me, I'll do nothing' stance in Presidential races, and were not aligned at all on slavery, the major issue of the day. After their collapse the Republican Party was created around a platform of anti-slavery and strong federal economic development policy, which was the central focus of the Whigs. Adding the anti-slavery stance and dropping the 'we won't use the Presidency to actually do anything if you elect us' plank drew a lot of anti-slavery democrats in the north and more abolitionist voters who were refusing to vote for Whigs, which made the new party viable, and they won the Presidency in just their second presidential election cycle.",cptjeff,2024-08-13T12:05:38,43
"If you were to ask anyone in 2008, the Republicans were done for, because Demographic changes would mean that the younger demographic which is left-leaning would take over.    Yet in 2016, Trump won over many voters who voted for Obama.  And even though Trump is not a leftist, he hit Hillary from the left by calling out Bill Clinton's passage of NAFTA, and how Hillary was calling the TPP the gold standard, which would, according to Trump, be the worst trade agreement in existence.  Parties shift all of the time, to capture different Demographics and to adapt to changing trends.",solid_reign,2024-08-13T12:33:01,17
"The last non-incumbent republican to win the popular vote was Bush Sr. in 1988. The swing state issue is an Electoral College issue - and the EC is already terribly undemocratic, and does the exact opposite of what it was intended to do. But as to your question, what will happen when Texas flips blue due to gradually increasing educational attainment rates? The GOP will have to change their platform to appeal to the average American. They've been courting single-issue voters in swing states since the 1970s, but that's only been sustainable due to the EC. They'd have to spend years rebuilding burnt bridges with women, non-whites, college grads, voters under 50, non-Christians, the middle class, legal immigrants, and all of the other demographics they've been able to write off the past half century. ",valvilis,2024-08-13T17:04:21,10
"The more intriguing question is what would hapoen if the pooukation shifted to such a degree to cause the Electoral College to essentially disenfranchise most voters. The obvious thought experiment would be if California had 54% of the population, meaning it had 270 ekectoral.votes, and the vote of anyone in any other state was irrelevant to the Presidency.",LiberalAspergers,2024-08-13T14:21:22,7
"The losing political party would shift its policies to pick up voters from the winning party. If it continues to lose it will dissolve and another party will take its place. It’s even possible that the winning party will fracture into two separate parties, one of which will try to pick up the losing party voters.",stewartm0205,2024-08-13T15:01:11,1
That would be excellent and America could have equal votes. One vote from a voter in Wisconsin would equal one vote from a voter in Pennsylvania. One vote from a voter in Wyoming would equal one vote from a voter in California.,seanosul,2024-08-13T17:10:33,1
"Losing side strategy should be to make their solid states less safe in return for having more of a chance in the opponents, and hoping to win both - so go moderate.",RusevReigns,2024-08-15T21:58:23,1

"I guess in scenario where much more than half of the country lived in one state and voted entirely for Democrats, while the other lived in the other 49 states and voted entirely for Republicans, then Democrats would consistently win the presidency, but Republicans would consistently hold the Senate. That margin would be wide enough that they could change the electoral rules even more in their favor, regardless of the presidency.  Though I’m not sure about the House.  Edited for grammar",musicalmeteorologist,2024-08-13T15:16:00,5
">54% of the population, meaning it had 270 ekectoral.votes  If one state had 54% of the population, it would have only 237 EVs (.54 x 435 + 2 = 236.9). It would require almost 62% ((270-2)/435 = ~.616) of the population to control 270 EVs.",curien,2024-08-14T10:47:48,1
You’re hypothetically correct except that the votes would never matter unless preferences altered drastically but then you would likely end up with different “swing states”.,Aruba808,2024-08-15T13:04:39,1
"But the popular vote doesn't win elections, if it did, we'd have different candidates and political party alignment.  Parties shift to win elections, not to win the popular vote.",solid_reign,2024-08-14T07:51:09,5
"Three months later and you still failed to make a valid point. The only group Trump gained any votes with was Latinos, and he lost the same number to white women, for a net gain of zero. ",valvilis,2024-11-12T16:13:45,1
">Though I’m not sure about the House.  If a state controlled 270 EVs, it would have 268 House districts, so it would need the majority party to control just over 81% of them. That's a tall order in a state that large, but not unthinkable. I think the only states in the last couple of elections that have at least 10 seats and one party wins that portion or more are IL and MA (and WA is very close).  But really to prevent legislation while they control the presidency they just need to be able to prevent overriding a presidential veto, so only 146 seats, or a bit under 55% of the state's total. That is easily doable.  But what really matters in this scenario is that it would only take 3/4 of the states' legislatures to agree to pass a new amendment that could change things completely.",curien,2024-08-14T11:23:59,2
"It doesnt matter which way they vote, if one state is 270 EC votes, no vote in any other state matters in ANY possible scenario. The only votes that count are in that one state. Doesnt matter if that state is rwd, blue, or tossup, there is no scenario where any vote in the other 49 states affects the outcome.  If one party wins that hypothetical CA by 1 vote, and the other wins the other 49 states with 99% of the vote, all 270 EC still go to the CA winner, and they are president.",LiberalAspergers,2024-08-13T15:34:00,-1
