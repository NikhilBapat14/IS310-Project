"Curtis Yarvin is a dipshit despite referring to himself as an ""intellectual."" His ideas are thin and convey little information while having the illusion of meaning. He never really grew out of his origins as a racist shitposter.  He's another Stephen Miller but with hair and a dash of emotional control.",Ratermelon,2025-05-09T08:41:17,41
Yarvin went from fringe blogger to influencing real policy. Wild how fast tech culture merges with government now.,fulltrendypro,2025-05-09T08:33:01,13
Yarvin had a really “fun” What If thought one day. He played with it for a long time. Fleshed it out. Ran it past his college buddies and they liked it. Used it at parties so he could be the one talking for a long while. His “fun” What If thought went a bit viral among friends of his friends.   Then it became reality and he realized his circle of friends weren’t an unbiased test audience for his “fun” little What If thought. That many many people can easily see the flaws in it and pick it apart. So now he needs to find ways to pretend he had nothing to do with it.,Jakobites,2025-05-09T09:04:36,12

"Before gutting the federal workforce became Elon Musk’s job, it was Curtis Yarvin’s dream.  Yarvin — a Silicon Valley blogger and software developer who argues for replacing American democracy with a dictatorship — spent years outlining an assault on what he calls “the cathedral” of elite power and consensus. Long before the U.S. DOGE Service launched in January, Yarvin coined his own four-letter acronym for bureaucracy-slashing: RAGE, or “Retire All Government Employees.”  Although he says he has never met Musk, Yarvin is a powerful influence among those carrying out DOGE’s radical cost-cutting agenda, two advisers to the effort said. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to describe the group’s work, said Yarvin had offered “the most crisp articulation” of what DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, is trying to achieve.
