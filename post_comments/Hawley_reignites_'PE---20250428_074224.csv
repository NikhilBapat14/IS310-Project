"Prevent buying and selling of stocks and bonds and prohibit them from voting at shareholders meetings. Not sure about forcing lawmakers to divest themselves from stock owned prior to election. Overall, it's simply unethical to use their elected office in a way that's essentially insider trading.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T07:49:57,735
"They like to talk about this bill, or something equivalent, about every 6 months. They'll never act on it, and if they do, it will have intentional loopholes ( family have no restrictions, etc ).",jcr2022,2025-04-28T10:10:50,58
 As far as I know they aren't supposed to be trading already.  BUT their spouse's are allowed to.  That's the rub.  Correct me if I am wrong.,ApricotNo2918,2025-04-28T07:57:20,217
This should apply to family as well. We know Pelosi uses her husband as proxy,NuclearOrangeCat,2025-04-28T09:00:35,133
or just make the transactions public. it is stupid i have to wait a month to see what she traded,icemichael-,2025-04-28T08:41:02,97
Sure they are!! I'm so fucking sick of the bullshit pandering.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-04-28T11:04:27,18
"What about a compromise? They can trade stocks, but anticipated transitions must be disclosed online three (3) business days BEFORE said transaction is executed. And once itâ€™s posted, the lawmaker MUST execute it.",acreekofsoap,2025-04-28T08:53:07,50
If he was serious about the bill he would've picked a different name.  There's already a [House bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/253) that does the same thing.,ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-28T10:15:12,43
"The issue will always be family members.  And long term girlfriends/boyfriends. Or lawyers.  Unless we find a way to police them all, there isn't going to be a meaningful change.",cathbadh,2025-04-28T19:20:36,9
Let Nancy buy index funds with the rest of us.,WoodEyeLie2U,2025-04-28T09:06:25,18
I love Hawley bringing this issue up every couple months.  We all know they aren't ever going to change anything.  But at least he is there pointing out the issue.,murderinthedark,2025-04-28T11:11:14,14
That is a superb name for the act.,wanttostaygottogo,2025-04-28T09:53:40,6

"Everyone besides lawmakers agree with this. Wouldn't it be a dereliction of duty, at the very least, to not enact?",drunkdoor,2025-04-28T10:12:48,193
"Oh Iâ€™m 100% sure about forced divestment. Send the money to a CD and lock it up until end of your term and then you can reinvest it.   Otherwise, congressmen/women should have no business dabbling in any investment whatsoever aside from their house they own.  That should be the cost of running for a congressional (or any government) office. You have to be willing to give up your portfolio aside from your house for the duration of your term(s).",ITrCool,2025-04-28T13:38:55,45
"And thatâ€™s how many of them get around any glancing inquiry. They are not trading, but their spouse is and the spouse is beating the market.",Achmetan,2025-04-28T08:16:33,115
There are people who follow Paul Pelosi's stock picks for investing guidance. He's more successful than Warren Buffet ðŸ˜…,WoodEyeLie2U,2025-04-28T09:11:25,31
Technically you could create an index-fund that tracks a single stock to work around a trading ban.  That's another proxy.,ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-28T10:18:45,15
"Yeah, require them to post their trades to a public database within minutes of the trades happening. We have the technologyÂ ",AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-04-28T10:38:52,57
It's like asking them to enact term limits. They have a million excuses not to do so.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T10:28:54,100
Why cant we have some sort of vote of no confidence or conflict of interest  procedure where it can fall to a popular vote like a law on a state ballot. The people need to be the one voting for this not the politicians themselves.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-28T11:55:51,42
"I'm not sure I agree, but only because I don't think it solves the problem. What would stop Pelosi's husband from buying the stocks? Or a sibling? A friend?  Lets say my cousin, who I speak to once a year at Christmas for all of 10 minutes, gets elected to office. How can their decision prevent me from trading stock? I had no say in it, I may have even actively voted against them. Yet anything else doesn't solve the problem at all?  Insider trading is already illegal, what does this proposed bloat do that's not already covered?",Daxidol,2025-04-28T13:34:43,-4
"I get what you're saying but since over 60% of people in the US own stock I think we'd miss out on a lot of qualified candidates. Many would bypass public service to keep their portfolios, and I can't say I'd blame them.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T17:30:28,7
"I definitely disagree about money sitting in a CD. A CD has paid like 2% most of the last 20 years, and close to 0% at times.   That's called idiotic financial management, and someone dumb enough to do that doesn't qualify for the job of president (especially in a country that runs a massive budget deficit, seems we've got financial idiots running the government).   Then you'd have issues of people like Trump being forced to sell their business (a treasured family company handed down from his parents) and put the money into basically negative equity (after interest). Hell no! That's how you get only idiots like Walz signing up, a guy who doesn't even own a house despite decades of drawing 6 figures.   I can see a blind trust for businesses and ETFs for a stock portfolio. That should be the way.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-29T06:41:33,1
"Yup, and in that case they should 100% be accused of insider trading and if found guilty the politician should be immediately impeached.  Then removed from ever holding any office ever again.",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-28T08:39:48,63
"Sounds great, doesn't work. Only kinda /s",RipVanToot,2025-04-28T18:14:30,1
"You're falling onto the crux of why politicians spend so much time making sure we're busy fighting each other (Dem vs Rep) instead of coming together to enact real governmental change that is needed.    The will of the people could fix many of these ridiculous things, such as term limits on congress, getting money out of politics and so on...but it would require a convention of the states, which requires the majority of the people in this nation to agree on something.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-28T18:52:49,49
"In my state, the legislature has to approve ballot measures.",RipVanToot,2025-04-28T18:15:57,1
"I'd say if there's material impact don't let perfect be the enemy of good. I also expect that ""better"" legislation should come, and it should repeal out of date legislation",drunkdoor,2025-04-28T14:27:13,26
"But I don't even see how it's 'good', what does it achieve that's an improvement over existing legislation?  To be clear, I 100% agree that it's an issue, I just don't think the proposal combats it.",Daxidol,2025-04-28T16:49:14,1
