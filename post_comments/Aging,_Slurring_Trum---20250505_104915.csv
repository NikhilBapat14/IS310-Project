The friend said that as Fred Sr.’s disease worsened––he once came down the stairs wearing three neckties––the family created a system so that Fred could think he was still running the Trump Organization. Every day Fred Sr. would go to the office in Brooklyn and they would give him blank papers to sort through and sign.

"My one major conspiracy indulgence is that I think he had a medical event on the campaign, more or less recovered but is actively being medicated and monitored with a touch-and-go likelihood that it will happen again. Most likely it was a (mini) stroke.   Admittedly I hate the dude and want to read tea leaves about his demise but it isn't entirely baseless. Down the stretch on the campaign he abruptly cancelled some events, went quiet for some time, showed up late to others and just generally looked and sounded particularly *rough*. While he did more or less recover, this event likely accelerated his mental decline as in the past few months alone he's become noticeably more insane.  Dementia progression tends to be slow and stepped. Patients compensate and stabilize in various ways then take periodic slides further down. It can seem to be normal then take a steep step. Often this occurs alongside other medical events and timeline wise it would align that somewhere on the campaign something happened and he's been in a slide since.",ckglle3lle,2025-05-05T12:53:17,2

"The confabulation from the moderate stage onwards is hard to deal with as a family caregiver. You hear some shocking revelations that you simply can’t tell if they’re real or not. Things asserted as fact that are pure make-believe, like intrusions of dreams into their reality, and they change the moment they’re said. They’ll deny they ever said it, take offence that you mentioned it, agree, then get wildly angry about it.  People with moderate stage dementia can look totally normal, for entire minutes at a time, but they can’t help but loop on subjects, and those loops get shorter and shorter as they progress. They become unstuck in time, as their access to the immediate future and past becomes more and more difficult. Yesterday becomes every day, years ago, tomorrow and never.  Short-form text can be constructed rationally for a while, until grammar becomes too hard. The length of the text may shrink to what they can cope with. They will ruminate on their inbox, reading it over and over before gaining the impetus to write a reply that is usually completely divorced from context or nuance.  People with dementia are EXTREMELY vulnerable to scams and misinformation.  This is not a good road to walk for a retiree in supported care. To be a president with dementia?

"> You should read the transcript of his Time Magazine interview from last week.  [Available here.](https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/)  An example:  > No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country.  And another fun exchange:  > **Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you?**  > No.  > **You won’t?**  > Nope.  > **Has he called you yet?**  > Yep.  > **When did he call you?**  > He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf.   > **But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him?**  > I don’t–I just look—  > **Well, what did he say?**   > If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay.",Pettifoggerist,2025-05-05T17:17:53,2

"I could be wrong, but it seems to me that the media is treading very carefully. They know he could retaliate against them for any perceived slight, and it's not always possible to predict what he will take notice of, or what will set him off.

"Maybe not with the party itself or how they handle things, but it absolutely will irreparably damage the Republican party's connection to MAGA.  Trump is the lynchpin keeping MAGA interested in politics. No one else has been able to rise to his level of stardom. DeSantis tried to and failed, Vance has the charisma of a rotten potato, and RFK was only mildly successful in siphoning votes from Trump for a short while.   Assuming we manage to impeach **AND REMOVE** Trump, he'd be reduced to a political commentator / influencer at best for him, and probably thrown in prison for the rest of his life at worst (again for him, unless of course Vance tries to pardon him). Not to mention the Democrats would have the majority in both the house and senate and be able to actually fight back against the Republicans. But Trump would still be very annoying as he'd be able to give a platform to others on the far right to try and woo MAGA to their side.   *But* as I mentioned in another comment yesterday, it's like comparing Darth Vader to Grand Moff Tarkin from Star Wars. Sure Vader is cool and badass, and probably has lots of fans he'd be able to convince to help him. But Tarkin is just a politician / military commander, he doesn't have the charisma that Vader does, so any attempts Vader makes to his fans to help Tarkin are always going to lose a good amount of steam as the less fanatical Vader supporters pull back due to a lack of interest. Same thing would apply to Trump and Vance. Trump holds the keys to MAGA, sure the more fanatical among them would jump to help Vance if Trump asks them to, but the less fanatical will pull away because Vance isn't Trump, he's not as interesting to them.  Now if Trump were to pass away (because his health isn't the best and he's getting up there in age), the GOP is completely fucked. They wouldn't even be able to try and have Trump rally the MAGA base for them, as most of MAGA would drop out of politics completely since he won't be around to keep them engaged, and anyone that tries to emulate him would easily be seen as a fraud / pretender to his throne. It would take an almost herculean effort on the part of the right wing propaganda machine to get anyone to his level, and that's assuming the various factions of the Far Right don't tear each other apart while they try to grab his power.  Like I doubt that the Andrew Tate manosphere, the Christian Right, and the Musk Techbro sphere would all have perfectly aligned goals. Their all going to want MAGA on their side, and will probably step on and over each other to get them.",Railroader17,2025-05-05T12:28:24,2

Before my grandmother passed, it was clear her mind was mostly gone. But she was reliving some of her rosy childhood memories, like taking the train to Florida (something she would frequently speak fondly of doing at that moment, while in her recliner in the memory care unit). Even coming up on the end, she saw the best in what her remaining life and memories had to offer. It brings my mom and I some comfort.",rosebomber,2025-05-05T12:55:03,83

Because a smart antichrist would be better at hiding his true nature and fooling well meaning people.
