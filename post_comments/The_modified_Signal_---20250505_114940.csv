"A hacker has obtained direct messages and contact information from TeleMessage, the Israeli software company that offers modified versions of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other apps to the US government, according to a report from 404Media.

It's amazing that heads haven't rolled for this.",barneyrubbble,2025-05-05T13:10:09,3
