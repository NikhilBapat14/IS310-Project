On June 1, 1954, the name of Armistice Day was officially changed to Veterans Day.24 This legislation did not establish a new holiday. Rather, it broadened the ""significance of an existing holiday in order that a grateful nation, on a day dedicated to the cause of world peace, may pay homage to all of its veterans."" “  - from congress.gov",EEcav,2025-05-02T21:29:24,1
