"“Weaken”, let’s see how this summer goes and how many people travel to or within america especially to southern states. Forget “weak”, it’s gonna be dead.",Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-02T13:50:02,41

"I churn credit-card points a bit, and anecdotally it’s easier to find award space on flights to the US now than I can recall at any point since the travel industry recovered from Covid. It definitely feels like airlines are having at least some trouble selling seats right now.",k_dubious,2025-05-02T14:29:53,5
"Heck, I’ve traveled over seas annually for 7 years now and this is the first time I’ve considered not going because I’M an American and fear that the experience would be tainted due to people hating us. Which means I wouldn’t buy flights worth thousands of dollars nor items for the trip itself. So it’s not just people coming in but I bet people leaving to go abroad from here as well which will impact the Airlines and economy.",TheHoodedRebel,2025-05-02T16:49:34,5
Definitely won’t be travelling back to America until they sort out what a backward shit hole it has become.,tommyerstransplant,2025-05-02T16:19:28,6

">Weakening travel demand, signaled by grim earnings forecasts of travel-related companies, may erase billions of dollars from the U.S. economy this year as the Trump administration's trade policy takes a toll on consumer sentiment, analysts have warned.""  >Anti-American sentiment could be driving a decline in international tourism, which is considered a service export,"" J.P.Morgan said in a note last week.  >Goldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan projected lower foreign travel spending to trim 0.1% from U.S. GDP this year, adding that the hit could be as much as 0.2% to 0.3%.  >As of the first quarter of 2025, U.S. GDP stands at $23.53 trillion, according to LSEG data, and the impact could amount to anywhere between $23 billion and $71 billion, based on Reuters calculations.  >""Tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the United States. The bigger issue is a pullback in tourist visits to the U.S.,"" Goldman Sachs said in March, at a time when Europeans were already [booking fewer trips](https://www.reuters.com/world/some-europeans-reconsider-trips-us-protest-against-trump-2025-03-24/) to the country.  >President Donald Trump's erratic tariffs have also led to global consumers [boycotting and ditching](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/danes-boycotting-us-products-like-coca-cola-carlsberg-says-2025-04-29/) U.S. products and brands.",YesterShill,2025-05-02T13:35:38,1
"With drastically lower demands I anticipate cheaper tickets which means more travelers going abroad from the U.S. for international travels. MAGA type, will likely travel from Texas to Florida and perhaps to Russia.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-02T14:22:35,1
And this year is still seeing a lot of pre-booked travel. There are fewer people automatically booking for next year at the end of their current trips.,Imacatdoincatstuff,2025-05-02T14:23:49,8
"As an American It amazes me how many people wanted to come here on vacation in the first place.  With the exception of a few major cities like Vegas, or NYC, and unusual places like Hawaii or Alaska, there's not much worth flying across the world for over here.  I live outside of D.C. right now. Huge tourist spot, but the reality is, outside of the museums and the historic government buildings that everyone knows, it's just a regular ass city. Not even particularly nice. Go to Paris instead, they got cooler stuff to see over there.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T14:05:05,16
Hell when I was vaccination in Japan I lost count of the number of times I warned people not to visit my state when they said they wanted to do so. Like my first question is why and the followup to the warning was do you plan on doing ride shares everywhere?,Raregolddragon,2025-05-02T15:06:59,1
yeah i travel across the world to forget about trump but have to be reminded. I stopped going to Europe and just do Asian countries now,sktzo,2025-05-02T22:43:27,1
It’s sad that I’m happy you’re not coming :(.,Xanderson,2025-05-03T02:35:13,1
Not if they voted for Trump.  This is what they voted 6 I hope they lose everything.,YesterShill,2025-05-02T16:34:02,2
"Cheaper tickets are good, but the weaker dollar hurts.  On Jan 19th, 1 dollar would get me 155 yen.  Today I get 143.  That means Hotels, food, and everything you buy is now 10% more expensive.  So even if the flight is a bit cheaper, the vacation isn't.",Randomperson1362,2025-05-02T15:26:31,2
I just want to know when the sweet deals start arriving for hotels in the United States.,timesuck47,2025-05-02T16:10:51,1
"The US has lots of amazing places to visit! Our national parks for one (until Trump sells them to the highest bidder). The Grand Canyon, Brice, Yellowstone, etc are places that I would fly across the world to visit. This is a big country with a lot of stuff to see.  That said, If I lived in another country, I wouldn't visit the US for at least another 4 years.",Professional-Can1385,2025-05-02T14:19:30,20
"The US has some amazing national parks and vistas, like Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon. Florida and California are a major destination for travellers looking to get some sun. Events like Mardi Gras, Burning Man, Coachella have international pull as well. People also have varied interests that can drive them to places like Hollywood, Roswell, Nashville, or to places where their favourite artist is currently touring.  There are plenty of reasons to go, but the current administration seems intent on supplying more and more reasons not to.",Filthy_Cossak,2025-05-02T14:22:13,8
That's silly.  You're just jaded because you live here.  Beyond all the natural wonders there are plenty of reasons to visit the US.,rockum,2025-05-02T14:55:49,12

yeah the National forests and parks are where its at aside from the few coastal cities,sktzo,2025-05-02T22:37:56,1

"Maybe to a certain degree, but there are actual world heritage sites and budlings older than Cristopher Columbus just casually tucked into European cities, so it's hard for me to compare the two and justify telling someone to fly out because we got the grand canyon or Yosemite with nothing else interesting within 100s of miles.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T15:35:51,1

People tend to go for things that they're not used to.... I went to school next to a medieval abbey dating from the 14th century or something. Passed it every day - nothing special about it. But the same area also calls anything with more than a quarter mile of unbroken trees a 'forest'. Having no houses within a 5 mile radius would be utter wilderness...,IkkeKr,2025-05-02T16:54:57,3
You don't need to tell people anything.   Millions of tourists every year obviously see something worthwhile in visiting the US.,rockum,2025-05-03T13:50:48,1
Yea can't do that in the USA. I mean you can on paper but it will miserable and very limited where you can if you want to even try going to another city... or another part of the city with out an ride share or another plane ride.,Raregolddragon,2025-05-02T16:13:21,3

That is 100% wrong. I used to drive down to Seattle from BC often. No USA license needed.,Over_Cartoonist7869,2025-05-02T23:25:20,2
"I've been to Paris, London, Madrid, Lisbon, Ireland, Mexico, and Canada.  Again, millions of tourists every year are *eager* to visit America.    It's not just sights that people seek, it's also the opportunity to see American culture first hand.   And you say they're wrong.  How silly!",rockum,2025-05-03T16:30:51,1
Then my buddy from the UK must have spent a week in the county jail in a California when driving without one due our shit and corrupt patch work that passes for law enforcement over nothing.,Raregolddragon,2025-05-03T00:15:28,1
