"""It was less horrible than expected"" isn't exactly a win.",ZebTheFourth,2025-05-02T07:59:27,32
"Dude just needed to not go insane with tariffs and he was gonna get at least a cut, maybe two this year. ""Do nothing"" would have been the best thing he could have done for the economy and for his rate cut hopes.",AnalTongueDarts,2025-05-02T08:20:19,10
The job report was just people they fired that they had to rehire.  This administration isn't creating new jobs.,Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T08:20:06,19
That's not how it works Donald.,Ouibeaux,2025-05-02T07:59:40,5
Why is he so hung up on getting rates cut? His obsession with it makes me suspicious.,mkt853,2025-05-02T08:23:41,3

The bigger story was the 177K jobs. lol ,Current_Animator7546,2025-05-02T08:06:24,-1
That’s how the media treats Trump. If something is expected to be really bad and ends up being only *pretty* bad they praise him.,--kwisatzhaderach--,2025-05-02T08:43:51,9
"Lol it's sort of like I'd you tank the stock market and do things that make it rebound, it wasn't actually a single greatest jump in the market if it's a net fucking 0.",mattgen88,2025-05-02T08:21:56,7
I'm surprised he doesn't just lower it by executive order.,Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-02T08:44:54,3
"A lot of business runs on loans. If businesses can pay a slightly lower interest rate on those loans, they can eke out a few more dollars in profit. A lot of business people get hung up believing that these few dollars will revolutionize their business, but I've seen the ""take the time to do it right the first time so you don't have to do it twice"" philosophy work a lot better.",Ouibeaux,2025-05-02T08:51:27,8
"Rates are kept high to stifle economic growth, which in turn is a tool used to keep inflation under control. Trump believes inflation is good and wants good economic growth numbers. It’s not much more complicated than that",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:08:18,2
"And it was ran by a Dem under Biden, do you have a point here?",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:04:40,-2
"I mean, total BS. Rate cuts allow businesses to invest in new projects. No one wants to start a new project with high rates, bc you now need a higher NPV to justify even starting on that project.",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:06:34,0
"Yes, independent thought is not allowed under Trump. If you don't do what he wants he'll just call your wife ugly.",MagicBingo,2025-05-02T09:19:02,2
"That’s just brainwashing. If you don’t think Dems during a fucking election year were massaging every economic number they were in charge of, then I have a bridge to sell you.",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:20:49,-6
"So now you're saying that it's ok to fudge numbers because ""the other guys are probably down it too"".  I can see why Trump appeals to you. He's relatable in an intellectual way.",MagicBingo,2025-05-02T09:27:06,5
"Sure, delete your account OR find where I said that. Your choice. I’ll wait.",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:32:50,-3
Censoring the truth is certainly on-brand for a Trump supporter.  I'll wait.,MagicBingo,2025-05-02T09:51:05,5
"Oh, no balls? You’re supposed to find proof of what you accused me of saying, or admit that you can’t? I’m not censoring anything. After all, if what you said I said actually happened, you wouldn’t have to delete your account.",Cold_Breeze3,2025-05-02T09:54:29,0
Apparently your bot history is turned off and you can't remember what you posted.  Bad bot. Delete yourself.,MagicBingo,2025-05-02T10:03:36,3
