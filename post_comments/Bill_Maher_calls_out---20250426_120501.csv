Who cares what Bill Maher says? His 15 minutes of fame is LONG gone.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-26T12:06:51,24
We have the biggest life expectancy gaps between the poor and the wealthy. Maher ignores that and pretends our Healthcare system is better than rival nations because it works fine for his income class.¬†   Isn't Maher already a nazi by using propaganda to defend a system that results in minorities living far shorter lives? Do you have to put minorities in a gas chamber or can you just kill them slowly?,ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-26T12:09:15,12

Bill Maher is an idiot...,whatzgood,2025-04-26T12:05:45,16
Just like the beginning of 1930's Germany didn't have any red flags... Because there was no relatable historical precedence. We fucking have that now. Anyone has the ability to look at the totality of rise of Nazism during that time. Fuck you Bill Maher. Fuck you to Hell.,williamgman,2025-04-26T12:13:34,7
"Yeah, after 30 years of following Bill, buying a few of his books, following the careers of his frequent guests, I'm done. Unsubscribed from his shows on Spotify, which was how I was getting Real Time for the past couple years. It's just over, he's lost his way. His guests are nobodies and the writing is on the wall",gorillasuitriot,2025-04-26T12:27:20,7

"Bill is right.  Nazi's had better outfits.  Other than that, the comparison fits, and that Venn diagram is becoming more of a single circle with every passing week.  That Bill Maher misses that just highlights his grotesque entitlement.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-26T12:53:54,6

"I didn't read it because it's on the lying network but Maher has this thing about not comparing current people to Nazis. Nazis brutally murdered millions, nobody is doing that today, so the comparison makes no sense, is usually his line of logic.  But he always misses the point that the Nazis were not always seen as the most evil group to have ever lived. They became more evil gradually over time with the support of millions.  If you see a group using the same techniques the Nazis used to gather support and do more and more evil things, why can't you call them Nazis? Why do I have to wait until they also kill millions and then go, 'hmmmmm I guess they really were as bad as the Nazis'.",Purify5,2025-04-26T12:50:51,3

"Bill Maher is a neoliberal, a complete sellout to the upper class. He is the type of person who prefers stability over justice and profit over people. He would welcome fascism into America if the billionaires asked him to. Neoliberals might not be fascists but they hold the door open for them.",digiorno,2025-04-26T13:57:00,1

Fox LOVES to cherry pick Bill Maher because their minions believe he's some representation of liberal Americans. Maher sees this as a win-win because more eyes equal more money.,williamgman,2025-04-26T12:18:07,30
