To a young person a crime that carries a potential life sentence is more of a deterrent than to an elderly individual who might not have much to care about the consequences of their actions. I would not piss off the old folks when a lot of this is their only source of survival.,Broke-Till-Payday,2025-04-28T11:32:30,88
Trump and the GOP can't attack social security directly so what they're doing is crippling the agency with staffing cuts and office closures. Social Security can be saved but we will need a Democrat to do it. Republicans dream of getting rid of it so there will be more money for the rich.,joekerr9999,2025-04-28T11:42:58,42

"I’m a millennial and went on to the SSA website to download my SSA record to see how much I’ve contributed since I started working. It was over $50k, under $100k.

My first thought when I read the headline was “if this is what’s going to take care of Trumpism and the GOP then I am all in.”,juniorone,2025-04-28T13:40:28,8
"Just a reminder that no social security will result in people dying on our streets destitute and starving. There won't be medical care and housing.   This won't happen behind closed doors because there won't be places that take them for free.   The American dream is not a multi-generational home. This society is not set up for a sudden drop in elderly and special needs care and putting that onto families.   What's the percentage living paycheck to paycheck? How many have parents that they'll now need to take care of? Because not taking care of them will be the end.   The grossest part is this is going to be another massive gain for the rich and drive the wealth gap even further as people take on family care and costs that will act as basically an incredible regressive tax burden as most people can't afford it and barely affecting the multi/hundred millionaires and billionaires.   A slow withering of the SSA allows for people to adapt to the changes. I'm 38 and never expected benefits, but a slow burn out. If the SSA drops within even a couple years, the impact is going to be catastrophic ",elcapitan520,2025-04-28T16:43:10,5

After January 6 there should've been immediate trials for treason, Trump and his cronies thrown into prison, and a major investigation into why the intelligence community didn't warn about it or prepare better for it.  No. It's not satire. It's acknowledging that the DNC has left millions of Americans lacking faith in them. Every single election was the ""most important election of our lives.""   When they won they'd screw around and fail to deliver on almost any of their promises, even in times of majority. When they'd lose they'd have donation links in your email inbox the next morning.    They abandoned queer people, people who are against genocide, and people who wanted a Green New Deal in favor of a legacy relic who couldn't string a coherent sentence together and did NOTHING to raise up a new generation of leaders, in favor of the same Schumer-and-Pelosi flavored trash we've been getting for decades.  Don't you dare try to scold me about how bad fascism is. I'm a trans person and I've had so many ""Vote Blue No Matter Who"" people telling me I deserved to go to Trump's concentration camps when I expressed that I didn't like Biden.
