"The biggest difference is efficiency. Policies in India's democracy, even if corruption is somehow stopped, take longer to work their way through the political process into implementation. China's small authoritarian gvt is able to take an idea and get it going in a much faster time.  I'm not against democracy, but India is enormous and their democratic processes take a long time for a policy idea to break ground.",tsamvi,2023-01-13T00:22:26,5
"A great book that goes into this is *Why Nations Fail* by Acemoglu and Robinson. I think they would contend that any country with a huge population and pre-industrial economy could see a great deal of rapid economic growth just by industrializing, but the tricky part is turning that into sustainable, long term economic growth once that country is ""caught up."" The example here being the USSR that showed incredible economic growth in the post-war period only to hit a plateau because they didn't create sufficiently inclusive economic and political structures.  When the book was published, China had seen similar early growth, only to taper off a bit, but not as much as in the USSR because China did some economic reform that moved towards more inclusive structures (though it was an open question how much that could continue without continuing to more economic inclusivity).   I see no reason why India would be any different. India could easily be the next country to have that kind of economic growth (assuming the political system changes enough to allow that--both USSR and China's growth came only after socialist revolutions). But whether that growth could continue after they are ""caught up"" is the much harder question.  *Why Nations Fail* isn't without its detractors, though, so it's very possible that they're completely wrong about this. I mean, India hasn't seen that transformation yet despite seeming being ripe for it, so maybe not.  As far as Russia, I think with the invasion of Ukraine struggling so, you could make the argument that Russia is *already* a second-rate power.",mormagils,2023-01-13T10:29:40,4
"I think it might happen after 20 years.  They have to get a handle on things like extra-judicial killings.  The wealth gap is the biggest problem. All their money is concentrated in a few cities.  Then again, China treats the rest of the country not on the eastern seaboard like chopped liver aside from maybe Chengdu.  Another difference is that the tech service/digital sector is what's leading economic growth in India as opposed to tech manufacturing/non-tech manufacturing in China.  I can see remote work exploding. You can live like a king outside of the big cities if you still get the big city salary.  It's a very complex question though with a thousand more factors.",[deleted],2023-01-12T18:40:28,5
"No, India's economy is still largely imperialized by western forces. Most of their natural wealth has been robbed from them over hundreds of years, and due to their capitalist model that incentivizes short-term gain over long-term investment, India does not and likely will not build a solid foundation for as robust an economy as China any time soon.",wiseoldllamaman2,2023-01-12T17:52:27,4
"There is alot more to it than just population size. China is far more advanced and efficient, and they have a stable appearing political leadership. India is going to take a while to catch up.",anotheravailable8017,2023-01-13T23:39:39,1
For the cities you might be missing Chongqing and Wuhan. But caring about the east makes sense cause 90+% of the population lives there,EquallyObese,2023-01-12T20:19:47,5
"TBF, not saying that India's economy is very robust, but a lot of analysts are predicting Chinese economic stagnation or even collapse. The bar for India's economy to be ""as robust as China"" might not be that high.",[deleted],2023-01-27T15:58:26,1

It's really funny that you post this comment right after I finished NPR's reporting on the downfall of one of three largest companies in India.  I'm not enough of an expert in either country to push past the propaganda of either nation to evaluate the situation much further.,wiseoldllamaman2,2023-01-27T17:16:10,1
