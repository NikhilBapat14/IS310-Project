"Anybody with MAGA people in their circle needs to confront them on everything, the deaths, the extrajudicial detention, the detention of legal residents, snatching people from their court appointments all of it. If they dig in their heels you know what kind of person they are. These people deserve to be socially ostracized. They've bitched and moaned for decades about being victims of the liberal media, the ""gay agenda"", ""Biden's DOJ"", the ""War on Christianity"", ""anti-white bias"", and any stupid little culture war issue they glom on to, so I say let's show them what it truly means to be ostracized. I've distanced myself from people with MAGA tendencies in my life long ago and have zero regrets. They deserve to be left behind. They'll never feel the pain they inflict on others, so denying them your friendship is they least you can do if they think minorities and immigrants don't deserve rights and happiness.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-05T23:13:55,9
"To give it context, 12 died in all of 2024. So the rate is up, but with small numbers like this, you can’t really do the statistics of how much it is increasing, just that it is increasing.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-05T22:53:20,18

It's important that they don't die before they reach the concentration camp in El Salvador that Trump sent then to for no reason. That would just be bad optics. /s,momalloyd,2025-05-06T05:17:30,2

Yep. When you include the people who have already been sent off to foreign death camps it is undoubtedly many times higher.,Deinosoar,2025-05-06T06:05:01,14

"You can't claim someone or an entity is murderous without proof of guilt. That's why it's libel. That's why newspapers always say ""accused"" or ""suspected.",SwinginScott,2025-05-06T09:05:57,4
"If it's a regular defendant, that's true.  Saying what the President did amounts to murder is not libel because there's a higher burden of proof for a prominent politician, in order to allow legitimate criticism of public officials.  The Trump regime is of course trying to change this law.",mmhannah,2025-05-06T23:54:23,1
