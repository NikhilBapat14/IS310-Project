Anyone know why he hates Latin American & South Americans so much?,ultralightdude,2025-05-01T22:40:26,13
"Almost everyone Trump is targeting have no criminal records. Trump isn't making the country any safer, he's just being cruel for the sake of being cruel.   Trump is the type of person who would trick homeless people into being hunted for sport.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-01T22:50:10,9
Don’t think that’s going to happen.,TDeath21,2025-05-01T23:21:30,1
"I don’t know if he hates them. They are just an easy group to go after en masse to get his deportation numbers up. And after scapegoating immigrants for taking jobs, burdening hospitals and schools etc. all through his campaign, he has to act like he is doing something.  Just deporting the “criminals” is not that easy so they are also trying to revoke the protections previously given to certain groups (eg Venezuelans, foreign students, Afghan refugees). But  also racism. After all, this is all Stephen Miller’s doing.",No_Taro_5540,2025-05-01T23:23:48,1
He's hoping that he can widen the scope and eventually deport Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez without anyone noticing.,Cyanopicacooki,2025-05-02T00:48:56,1
"Because in his and his followers' twisted minds (actually I think they share a single mind) it's easy to dehumanize brown people, who work low-wage jobs. If they had the courage, they would do the same to black people, just like their ancestors did for hundred of years.",csscp,2025-05-01T22:55:41,10
"Easy target. That's it. They're brown, often speak only Spanish, or English with a heavy accent. It's easy to pander to racists who don't view them as what an American is. That's why even Latino Americans have been called illegal, names by bigots. We've all seen videos of that happening.",mces97,2025-05-02T00:03:30,4

I am reminded of his social media post for Cinco de Mayo during his first time running. It was so out of touch with reality.,TheSoyster,2025-05-01T23:11:13,2
