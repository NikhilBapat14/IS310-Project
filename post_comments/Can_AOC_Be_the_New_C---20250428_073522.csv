"No, I don't think she can be an ineffective septuagenarian mouthpiece for the worst parts of the Democratic party",gorillasuitriot,2025-04-28T07:40:51,89
God I hope not.  We’ve already seen what Chuck Schumer can’t do.,RuairiQ,2025-04-28T07:36:37,43
God no... why would anyone want to be a Chuck Schumer?,addled_and_old,2025-04-28T07:39:41,28
God I fucking hope not. Why can't she just be AOC but with like more party support?,Responsible-Pain-620,2025-04-28T08:45:44,9
No she’s got balls,Drolb,2025-04-28T07:54:16,10
"Chuck Schumer is a weak, inconsequential leader who will go down in history as the Democrats most spineless minority leader who gave away an opportunity to push back against Republicans and the Trump Regime.  It's not much of a competition.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T08:10:14,7
"She's got a good chance to run for Senator if she chooses.  She's got all the ingredients to make a run for her first state wide office.  But, 2028 is a ways away.  Chuck may retire.",rapidcreek409,2025-04-28T09:10:22,3
Maybe in like 40 years she can be considered one of the elderly dinosaurs that refuses to give up power.,Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-04-28T07:38:08,6
AOC can be anything she wants. Screw the new chuck schumer. We need real change.,Sufficient-Row-3292,2025-04-28T07:50:58,5
How many college graduations can she speak at in one day?,LordBecmiThaco,2025-04-28T08:25:25,2
Not if Pelosi can help it!,CitySeekerTron,2025-04-28T08:52:55,2
I hope not!,Tobias---Funke,2025-04-28T08:55:16,2
We do not need a new chuck Schumer,stamina4655,2025-04-28T10:02:23,2
I certainly hope not. I like her just the way she is.,oldfrancis,2025-04-28T10:04:16,2
"Nope, she is vastly more intelligent and not a fucking coward .",Bmccallutah,2025-04-28T10:14:55,2
"No, she'd likely be much better",ManufacturerWild8929,2025-04-28T07:45:35,4
Talk about a low bar.  Can she sit in a Senate seat and do absolutely nothing.  I'm sure she can do better than that.,SkylarPopo,2025-04-28T08:08:22,3
Jesus! I was just eating. What a horrible visualization to put in my head!,FredUpWithIt,2025-04-28T07:41:45,2

"God, I hope not!",notoro2pu,2025-04-28T09:46:40,1
Don't let conservative news outlets try to divide us from the message that we need younger more progressive candidates to replace these DINOs.,FuzzyCub20,2025-04-28T09:51:59,1
I’d prefer the new Bernie.,ChaoticSenior,2025-04-28T10:54:34,1
AOC mops the floor with Bad Luck Chuck,ThePickledPickle,2025-04-28T11:56:43,1
"no, she’s the new Bernie Sanders",USS-Ohio,2025-04-28T13:56:06,1
"My take is I would be open to being a senate majority leader, but I wouldn't want her to be the nominee for president. I like the idea of her gathering consensus, but I would rather she not be the final decision maker.",ncolpi,2025-04-28T16:36:21,1
"Not even in the slightest.  She actually knows how to fight back and not bend a knee like some over the hill, out of touch boomer.",DarthHiccups,2025-04-28T16:47:51,1
"I don’t want a new Chick Schumer, that’s the point!",twitch_delta_blues,2025-04-28T19:27:55,1
Why would anyone want that?,DmAc724,2025-04-28T07:42:51,1
"Okay let’s do a test to find out. What was AOC doing for the last month? Campaigning against oligarchy across the country, meeting and talking to constituents, and spreading hope to voters. What was Schumer doing? Voting in favor of tax cuts for billionaires and removing healthcare from millions of Americans.   No, I don’t think she will be replacing Republican-lite Schumer.",brakeled,2025-04-28T12:40:24,1
I actually think she can be given real power and the continuing pressure to moderate her positions. She’s already barely left of center liberal,rundmz8668,2025-04-28T07:56:06,8
"Oh give it 40 years :)  LOL, she wouldn't be that useless even in old age. I could see her getting a bit more like Pelosi in old age, effective but staid, without the obsession with her personal wealth.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-28T09:25:32,-1

My immediate response.,BeardedSquidward,2025-04-28T07:51:09,4
I agree that she brings fresh energy and ideas.   I agree that she has the potential to shake things up in a positive way.  I don’t agree that she should be filling Schumer’s shoes.   She has her own!,RuairiQ,2025-04-28T07:42:56,9
