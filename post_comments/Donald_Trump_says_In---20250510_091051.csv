"His announcement shows just how badly he wants a Nobel, despite him having nothing to do with the agreement. Obama just lives in his head full-time.",dbuck1964,2025-05-10T09:19:16,3

It's worse than that. India and Pakistan now know that we have people inside their governments who feed the US intelligence because Trump couldn't keep his digital mouth shut. ,Blablablaballs,2025-05-10T09:25:49,10
