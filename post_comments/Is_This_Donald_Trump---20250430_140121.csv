"To save you an extremely banal click:   > “I just think that I say what’s on my mind.”   I don't think that's the ten thousandth most revealing quote from him. My nomination would be ""when you're a star, they let you do it.""",pervocracy,2025-04-30T14:05:04,30

"From the article: ""One of the defining debates of Donald Trump‘s decade-long dominance of American politics is this: Is he playing at a level—in terms of strategy, rhetoric etc.—that most people simply can’t grasp? Or at a level more simple than anyone imagines? Put another way: Is he playing three-dimensional chess, or is he eating the red checkers?""  Is the author serious?!  Anyone with more than two brain cells has realized a long, long time ago that Trump has never been a genius playing three-dimensional chess.  He is, and has been since 2016, a mentally disturbed old man with dementia eating the red checkers.",KimmyT1436,2025-04-30T14:26:04,3
Can’t read the article. Did he say “I’m a fucking moron with a fat ass and no moral compass?” Did he add “I is also not smart and I have a mushroom shaped micro penis?” Did he conclude with “when I purse my lips it looks like my butthole is on my face and I purse my lips anyway?” Because that would be very revealing,xyz_rick,2025-04-30T15:08:28,2
