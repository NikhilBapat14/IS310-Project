"In Ohio there are rules for how a recall election works. It would be carried out separately for each candidate. If you had 5 members of council, there would need to be a separate ballot initiative for each person that would require signatures to be collected for each and then validated by the BOE.  It is not an easy process, for good reason. Recalls rarely happen. For an entire government, it is very unlikely.",[deleted],2024-09-16T06:38:54,1
"The rules and plans are actually pretty well-handled. The recall initiatives won't be started until right before this upcoming election. They have over 50 volunteers signed up to be signature takers for the petitions, 3 drive-through locations, lawyers to make sure everything has been done right, and funds raised to pay them. The plan is to have all 7 or 8 petitions lined up so people can just go through and sign each one they want, at locations close to (but not at) polling locations to get as many people at once as possible. Starting in November so they can file in January once some of them have been in office for the required 1 year.  We just did a citizens initiative petition to recall an extremely unpopular law (couldn't do a referendum since it was passed by emergency) and got 3 times the number of required signatures in less than 24 hours. Fully half the households in the town have yard signs about being upset about the local government - it's insane right now. This is the second successful initiative petition in less than a year. Both went through the BOE process and signatures were validated. The first one was  challenged by the city, and went to the Ohio Supreme Court for not transmitting the petition to the BOE. The city got reprimanded by the court and ruled in the citizens' favor. This recent one council repealed the law after the initiative because of all the backlash and press.  It's a small town of only 15000ish people, so they only need about 600 signatures per official, and it's a small area so no one will need to go out of their way to sign.  It might not be everyone getting recalled, but I'd put money down that a big chunk of them are. That's why I am curious as to what would happen if everyone got removed. A year ago, I would have said it's ridiculous, but with everything that has been happening in the last couple of months, it's a real possibility. Council meetings are so highly-attended that they have to turn residents away.",closetklepto,2024-09-16T07:30:51,1
"You need to actually win the most votes. If you don’t have the votes to win, you are wasting taxpayers money.",[deleted],2024-09-16T07:41:45,1
"Well yeah, obviously. But when over 10% of the population signed petitions and more houses have signs than people voted in the last election, I would venture to say that a sack of potatoes could run against any of the council and win. It's not a waste of taxpayer money if it's what the taxpayers want.",closetklepto,2024-09-16T08:54:51,1
Ohio law indicates you need 15% of the voters in the last general municipal election to provide their signature for the recall. [link to ORC](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-705.92)  If the municipality is subject to self governing rules( i.e. a Charter) then the rules could be different.  You don’t win any election with just petition signers.,[deleted],2024-09-16T09:13:43,1
"Yes. In the last general election, just under 4800 people voted. For the citizens' initiative, over 10% of the ***population*** signed it in less than 24 hours, 1700 people. I was incorrect in stating we need 600 signatures per official; we actually need 640. More than 3000 households out of 5400 have protest signs. We do have a charter, but it just adopts ORC for referendums, recalls, and initiatives.  This is the most engaged I've ever seen the population in 30 years. I understand we need more than petition signers to vote, but this is huge.  The momentum is there, and it's pretty incredible. Again, remember, this is not a huge city. It's 10 square miles. For there to be this amount of movement and involvement is crazy. And what's really cool is that it's pretty apolitical party-wise; everyone is pissed.",closetklepto,2024-09-16T10:28:17,1
