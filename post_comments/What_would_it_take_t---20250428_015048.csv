"Last I checked it was over $15k per year to raise a child, but that includes things like housing, childcare, and medical costs.  If you have a big enough apartment or house such that you don't need to upgrade, you have someone that can take care of your child at home (one of the parents or a grandparents, etc.) and don't need childcare, and your child is lucky enough to be completely healthy, then much of that cost is reduced or irrelevant.  I would still expect somewhere between $500-$1000 a month in expenses for food, diapers, toys, safety equipment (i.e. strollers, car seats, etc.), pediatric checkups, etc.  I'd say $20k would be a decent incentive, but I still would look at it as a net loss.
