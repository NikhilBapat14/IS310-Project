"no doubt many of the EO's are very dangerous and need to be taken seriously.  I'm just pointing out that Trump doesn't have the power to actually make law, and some EO's are more enforceable than others.    This particular EO is of the incredibly stupid, yet not particularly dangerous variety in my opinion.",92eph,2025-05-07T13:51:30,1
"Sorry, Maga need constant distraction. Think crying baby and jangly keys. But if people on the opposite side are constantly trying to keep up with the drama and bullshit, think about how many things other people we aren't looking at could be doing. Makes me feel like a legit mental patient talking about that though. As a for instance, my best friend and one of the smartest people I know just went down a ""aliens are real and our government is feeding humans to them. That's why all the wars and fucked up shit."" Which is insane. Sounds like my grandfather, just before he stopped taking his meds and ended up slowly dying on his living room floor for a week. Which both validates my crazy thoughts in my own head and males me feel even crazier as a person. But maybe that's the goal? Make people feel insane so they don't fight back. I don't know. I'm barely keeping my own shit together most days. Literally started therapy last week and just word vomited on the poor woman about how crazy I feel. Luckily she didn't have me committed, but it's early days yet.",GoldenBrownApples,2025-05-07T13:39:19,1

"We’re talking about two different things now. My contention is the distractions, such as they exist, aren’t meant for MAGA. They already agree with Trump. They already think it’s great that people are being deported without due process, for example. There’s no need to distract them from it.  The distraction is for those who are opponents or potential opponents of the regime.",AtticaBlue,2025-05-07T13:45:03,1

I repeat: People can’t be talking about something they’ve never heard of in the first place.  There’s no A to be distracted from by B if you don’t know A exists.,AtticaBlue,2025-05-07T11:38:40,1
"OK I'll explain it this way.  There's a group of people, call them J (for ""journalists"") and then another group of people P (for ""the public"").  If J knows about some shady stuff going on, but aren't talking about it because they're distracted by the shinier outrageous things the administration is doing, then you, as part of P, may not hear about it.",thenasch,2025-05-07T12:05:07,1
"But what if we were talking about it, and now we aren't. Or, all the crazy conspiracy theories being thrown out, maybe some of them are real. But since everything sounds crazy how do you know which one is the real one? Flood the zone and all that. 10,000 lies and one truth would make that truth sound like a lie too. I don't know man I'm a crazy person whose brain is soup most days. But on the days it isn't? I can feel everything, everywhere. I felt one of my neighbors die. Didn't realize it, thought I was being stupid. Right up until the cops came and blocked off their apartment a week later. Nothing makes sense.",GoldenBrownApples,2025-05-07T13:44:27,1
"Except as I’ve pointed out the news is filled with reporting on all of the malfeasance going on. How the public chooses to deal with it is not on the news organizations.  What specific shady stuff is going on that you think is not being reported on? (Ironically, media reports also include reporting on the Trump regime’s “flood the zone” strategy, so it’s not even as if people aren’t aware the tactic is being used.)",AtticaBlue,2025-05-07T12:12:19,1

"You’re making my point though. For you to be distracted from thinking about A, you have to know A exists in the first place. But of the universe of remaining issues that are known, say B-Q, those are being reported because they’re known.  At best the regime could then be introducing R-Z to “distract” from B-Q, but not from A because none of us is aware of A to begin with. (The only other alternative would be that all of the media in fact does know about an A and is purposely not reporting on it. But that’s a level of conspiracy to which I don’t subscribe.)  The OP’s contention appears to be that we the public *do* know that A exists but the regime is using R-Z to distract from A. But to bring this back to the present, what would be an A in the current climate?",AtticaBlue,2025-05-07T13:14:39,1
