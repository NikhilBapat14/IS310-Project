Catholics understand no major political issue can be separated from faith and morals.  That bullshit gives you Biden and Pelosi claiming to be Catholic and personally oppose abortion but always voting for it.,NotRadTrad05,2025-04-30T23:30:51,9

Every political decision is influenced by your morality and ethics and imposes on others.  There is no difference between me having my political decisions influenced by my religion and an atheist being influenced by whatever forms their conscious.,NotRadTrad05,2025-05-01T06:10:06,6
