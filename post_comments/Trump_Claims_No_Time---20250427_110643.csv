"People being deserving of due process isn't even in an amendment, it's the core constitution.¬†   Any congresspersons not calling for impeachment are silently complicit in violating the core of the constitution.   Y'know, the thing that says you get your day in court, regardless of what happened. Yeah, that doesn't always happen, and frankly there needed to be a harder effort against racial disperities in police actions, but without this bullwark, any given child can be disappeared, tortured, or killed, potentially in front of the parents, to ensure compliance by fear to aligning politically with the leader's whims.   Not having it guaranteed kills critical thought,¬†kills research, stokes revolution, and is not a stable environment to operate business in, to say nothing of killing tourism, entertainment, or niceties built on peace.

"Why do you think it was a witch hunt? I'm serious. Did you read the evidence against him? Did you note how the the area with security cameras data at mar a Lago magically flooded? Did you see how careless all of those stolen classified documents were stored? Did you not pay attention when Trump changed his story multiple times? Do you not even know what the electors scheme was? You've called people dummocrats for not answering a question. I don't think youve bothered asking yourself these rather easy questions  And before you go into, well what about Hunter Biden or some bullshit notw that Trump was found guilty of 34 counts in the same judicial region as sitting Democratic Senator Bob Menendez. It wasn't a witch hunt in that case either, just like it wasn't in Menendez's.   Take the time to actually educate yourself on actual real evidence instead of listening to a guy who has abused the court system his whole life and fucked over working people.   Its evident looking at like 5 of your comments you just listen to right wing fear fueling sources who shout in all caps. Look at the actual evidence against Trump and ask yourself what you'd think of there was a much evidence against anyone else. I'd sure think there was guilt  Also, learn what fucking socialism is and see how components of democratic socialism have worked well in most established societies. It isn't the same as communism. And after you do that look at how Joe Biden wanted to sign a border bill Republicans negotiated but quit on when they realized it would give them one less thing to scare voters like you with because Trump, who never read it, said it wasn't good. Sure sounds like they don't care about border security. No one wants open borders. Maybe you dont, but the people you voted for sure don't care and use it as red meat to scare you with  You clearly have the internet and maybe should take the time to use it for accurate factual sources.",rounder55,2025-04-27T13:27:35,28
