There’s not anything to have any thoughts on—the issue was conclusively settled 60 years ago when Malaysia ejected Singapore,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-14T00:22:51,25
What’s the dispute? I lived there for a few years recently and never heard anything about it.  Singapore is happy being independent and Malaysia isn’t trying to take over Singapore now.,wanmoar,2025-04-14T05:58:40,10
Is anyone actively disputing Singaporean independence? Malaysia kicked them lut... end of story,pharaoh122,2025-04-14T04:58:20,10
"Worked out well for Singapore, clearly.  Neither side appears to have any significant dispute over it today and decades of recognition as an independent country.....means you are.",SkiingAway,2025-04-14T11:36:33,8
"Singapore's independence might have been born out of political and ethnic strife, but in hindsight, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to both sides. It allowed Singapore to pursue a radically different vision—one focused on meritocracy, economic openness, and strict governance. The results speak for themselves: from a poor port city to a global financial powerhouse. That’s not to say Malaysia didn’t benefit too—avoiding internal conflict over such deep ethnic divisions likely preserved national stability. Sometimes, a breakup is the healthiest choice.",Only_Economics7148,2025-04-15T01:36:33,3
"as a Malaysian. Nobody cares?   Singapore is independent, cool. Not even the politicians here dispute that.",65726973616769747461,2025-04-14T21:04:29,1
"1. This was amazing for Singapore.  2. Islam should have never been allowed to spread beyond the Middle East. It doesn't work in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia  3. I hope America can forcibly eject the wealthy blue states. We just have to be super annoying until they do it.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-14T09:45:54,-11
Yeah I think it was a no issues solution. Both sides were happy with the result.,StandUpForYourWights,2025-04-14T14:00:44,3
