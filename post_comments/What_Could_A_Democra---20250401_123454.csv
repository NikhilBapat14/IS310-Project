"Building is far harder than destroying, also there is a huge double standard for democrats vs republicans.  Just look at Clinton's emails investigation (which Condolezza Rice and Colin Powell also used private emails) vs the signal scandal regardling the Houthis.   Democrats are held to a purity card like standard while republicans pretty much get away with murder in broad daylight.",DontBeAUsefulIdiot,2025-04-02T22:41:27,41
I’d love to see a dem turn federal funding off to overly gerrymandered states. You want federal dollars? Fix your shit.,IniNew,2025-04-03T06:04:19,8
Increase funding for the IRS to go after billionaires. Cut unnecessary Defense spending. Do a DOGE-like program that actually wants an efficient government which invests in things that benefit society and the common man. Crack down on religious organizations who illegally preach politics from the pulpit. Commute all death penalty cases to life in prison without parole. Pull funding from Israel and Saudi Arabia. Enforce union worker protection laws. Threaten CEOs with penalties if they don’t do right by their workers.,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-02T22:45:56,24
"Create a Medicare buy-in and then tax health insurance companies into the ground (the latter wouldn't be good for the country or economy but it fits with the impulsive and emotional way that Trump makes decisions and his lack of regard for the consequences)  Expand and standardize Medicaid benefits and eligibility (force the ACA Medicaid Expansion, so reverse NFIB v. Sebelius)  Outlaw PBMs  Expand the court to overturn Citizens United and reverse the Dobbs decision  There are a lot of battles the Dems have lost that they could correct with a Trump-like approach that they've refused to take thus far, especially on social and economic policy.",TheMemeStar24,2025-04-02T23:13:03,7
"Roll SpaceX into NASA, take over Starlink and make it part of space force for national security reasons. Stop all oil subsidies. Put penalties on companies that have call centers, tech support, coding etc.  outside of the country. Force any company that wants to do business with the US government to have a union.  Stop sending federal dollars to any state with abortion laws. This is just some stupid ideas that quickly come to mind.  The issue is that it's so much harder to build up than to break things.",Traditional-Ad-3245,2025-04-02T20:57:39,24
"I’d hope that a Democratic president with that kind of boldness would use it not just to push a partisan agenda, but to work with Congress to actually rein in executive overreach.  True power should be given to those willing to give it up for the Union",already-redacted,2025-04-02T20:36:31,17
"If a Democratic president truly had Trump’s IDGAF attitude but progressive values, I think they could immediately:  1. Issue an executive order eliminating federal income tax for anyone making under $50k. This would instantly give breathing room to millions of struggling Americans.  2. Launch a UBI pilot program in economically distressed regions: $650/month to every adult as an ‘American Dividend’, and build momentum for nationwide implementation.  3. Direct federal agencies to aggressively enforce existing corporate tax laws and close loopholes, generating revenue for these programs.  The immediate impact would be millions of Americans suddenly having thousands more dollars annually, which creates a consumer spending boom in local economies. The long-term impact would be reshaping our economy to work for everyone, not just the wealthy.  These aren’t radical ideas, they’re practical solutions that most Americans would support if presented clearly without partisan framing. I’ve explored these concepts in depth at [bluehoperising.com](https://bluehoperising.com/) if anyone’s interested in the implementation details.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",BlueHopeRising,2025-04-05T03:50:11,3
"It depends now how many right wing supporters there are, and/or how disillusioned normal people are.   Tomorrow everybody could have universal healthcare, probably stop most wars, good jobs, good pay, reasonable housing.   Trump showed everybody how fast government can change when a group has enough power. There is no reason to think it can not swing the other way when enough people want it.",ComprehensiveHold382,2025-04-04T16:28:00,2
Build a coalition of the people wronged by Trump. Abandon the party and promise real change to the 2 party system,MxOffcrRtrd,2025-04-02T21:08:27,3
"Trump is more than just ""idgaf."" He's a populist. Remember his approval rating is hovering anywhere between 45-52% depending on the poll.  He's a populist and spent a good 12-14 years building that populist backing up. He piggybacked on the movement to make bullshit up about and hate Obama, found groups of people to blame everything that's wrong about America on, said he'd get rid of them or take care of them if he were elected, and so people elected him.  In the process he changed the entire identity and culture of the party to be about him. Anyone who was against him got primaried. Cheney = primaried. Kinzinger = targeted and censured.   So a worst case scenario (and I say this as a far leftist, I don't really like the thought of any authoritarian scenarios), it depends if it's a blue Senate, or if it's a ""blue"" Senate that has a bunch of Joe Manchins. That determines if a filibuster is preserved, and determines if SCOTUS can be expanded and packed. If you get the right justices on the court (i.e. in your pocket), you can do whatever you want. No filibuster, time is mostly arbitrary, they can do whatever they want in a 100 day deadline absent whatever time it takes to get through procedural hurdles of getting bills through House/Senate and getting through reconciliation if necessary. Obviously the same if the Senate decided to get rid of the filibuster for the Republicans.   If Trump has proven anything in 9 years, the Constitution has always been on the verge of collapse.  If you mean with the filibuster preserved and mostly via EOs and EOs, then it depends if the court gets rebalanced. If it does, and it's a 5-4 liberal majority, probably a lot more. Student debt cancellation comes to mind. Obviously anything Trump undoed via EO can be redone. EOs guide federal policy to execute federal law, so reinstate DEI objectives and protections, do more to respond to the aviation incidents we've been seeing, direct the IRS's focus for audits, guide federal contracts/contractors/whom contracts are awarded to. Rescind national emergencies that harm international relations.",SunnySydeRamsay,2025-04-03T16:50:33,1
"1. Stop all retaliatory tariffs on friendly countries 2. Apologize to the world  3. Implement a flat tax system where everyone, rich or poor, pay their fair share. 4. Reinforce the Constitution to make sure it is bulletproof and never gives King power to one individual.  5. Implement a blockchain digital polling system that is instant and encrypted and do away with paper ballots.  6. Invest in infrastructure in the United States, tech, data centers, quantum computers, nuclear etc..which would fuel the economy. 7. Overhaul Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,  making those agencies off limits to future administrations for dismantling. Never allow borrowing from Social Security for other government  agencies.   8. Bring back the consumer protection agency, which looks after you and your family.  9. Reverse all Trump executive orders that harm the economy and the people.   All these could truly Make American Great Again!",futuretrades,2025-04-06T11:34:07,1

"I have no idea of what a “Democrat president” could do. I don’t even know what a “Democrat president” is. Can you explain to me what a Democrat president even is?  Now a  *Democratic* president could do a lot. He could try to push the country to the left. Very, very far left of where we are today. So far left that we’d be to the left of Bernie Sanders, in fact we’d be so far left that we’d be right, where Republican president Dwight Eisenhower was.  Did you know that Republican president Dwight Eisenhower insisted on higher tax rate rates than Bernie Sanders does? And in Eisenhower‘s farewell address as president, he warned us against the military industrial complex? Yes, that’s how unbelievably unbelievably to the right we’ve gone. And that’s why things are all screwed up.  But a Democrat president? Sorry, zero idea.",Dharmaniac,2025-04-02T22:23:24,-6

They'd rig the primary and run a candidate on the merit of the color of their gender and skin while telling everyone they are the party of women's rights and anti-racism.

It would depend on whether he/she had a majority in both the House and Senate.  A Democrat would have a hard time acting like Trump because Democrats almost always look to spending more money and he/she couldn't just do that via EO.,JKlerk,2025-04-02T20:29:51,-4
"threaten college funding unless they allow trans women in women's sports, also threaten the funding if they have any pro Israel protests or allow jewish students to not be harassed.   fire any inspector general who might complain about funding NGOs ran by former and failed Dem politicians  open the borders again for mass walk on in migration  order the DHS to give the migrants SSNs and work authorization  Pardon the telsa arsonists   I don't think a president can mass hire with in an agency or if that needs funding / authorization from congress, but they can create agencies.  Agency of giving money to other countries could be created.   fund abortions , and gender theory stuff across the globe.

"“Work with Congress” is difficult when the other side doesn’t want to give you a win at all. Look at Merrick Garland for SCOTUS. Look at the border bill under Biden. We can give them what they ask for and they will still vote it down to own the libz. They are bad faith actors and the sooner we realize this and act accordingly then we will get some stuff done.

"Are you serious right now? The constitution is cooked. The checks and balances built into it no longer exist in a meaningful way. If Congress wants to do something, it should call a constitutional convention and forbid anyone with any link to Trump from being placed in any position of public trust.

"The superficial problem is that Democratic Congresspeople will hold a Democratic President to account in a way that the current GOP Congress does not with Trump.  We can put all the constraints we want on POTUS - you can be assured that Democratic Congresspeople will uphold them for all Presidents, whereas the GOP would turn a blind eye to them for a GOP President.  The deeper, more fatal problem is that the GOP and a critical mass of Americans are no longer interested in good-faith democratic governance.  The Constitution is an inherently democratic document, in that it doesn't force democracy on a populace who willfully rejects it.  I'm tempted to say that I hope Trump shows just how dangerous their tribalism has gotten, but that's basically wishing for an economic (or military!) catastrophe.
