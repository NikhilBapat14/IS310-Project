Why list their ethnicity in the title? Is it supposed to be relevant?,Ananiujitha,2025-04-24T17:20:25,-8
Arson at worst or vandalism,Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T17:10:19,12
"""MAGA DA U-turns on Alleged 'Domestic Terrorist' Tesla Vandal""  Which word are you referring to? ""Vandal"" - as in the group of people from around Poland about 15-20 centuries ago?",JakeConhale,2025-04-24T19:02:49,1
"I'm sure you're aware ""vandal"" is not used in regards to anyone's ethnicity in that headline.    This headline is from the US, where the word means ""a person who deliberately destroys or damages public or private property"".",Broken_Toad_Box,2025-04-25T00:35:40,1
"Yes.  If they are a Guandal@/Vandal, that's irrelevant.  If they aren't, and the newspaper, the district attorney, and the laws are using Vandal as an insult, that's worse.  If they are a Guandal@/Vandal, and the newspaper, the district attorney, and the laws are using Vandal as an insult too, that's still worse.",Ananiujitha,2025-04-24T20:59:47,1
Just because it's a common fucking slur doesn't make it less of a slur.,Ananiujitha,2025-04-25T00:52:46,1
"Typically, it's used to mean ""a person who deliberately destroys or damages public or private property."" Also part of the word ""vandalize"".  Not specifically an ethnic reference, but like ""barbarians"" it has roots in the ethnic reference.",JakeConhale,2025-04-24T21:08:04,1
Approximately during what time period was “Vandal” last recognized as an extant ethnic group?,SassTheFash,2025-04-24T23:47:42,1
"I don't think it is *ever* appropriate to use an ethnonym as a slur, as an insult, as a slur/accusation, etc.",Ananiujitha,2025-04-24T21:55:18,1
"So....""MAGA DA U-turns on Alleged 'Domestic Terrorist' Tesla vandal"" then?  Standard headline practice to capitalize the first letter of every major word. As for the people, apparently they ceased to exist around 534, but if you find a Vandal genuinely offended, then I'll take it under advisement. Otherwise, I would suggest arguing with the Oxford English Dictionary about it.",JakeConhale,2025-04-25T00:01:39,1
