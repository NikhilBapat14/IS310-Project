"*we detail the educational backgrounds, career paths, and international mobility of more than 200 DeepSeek researchers. Nearly all of these researchers were educated or trained in China, more than half never left China for schooling or work, and of the nearly quarter that did gain some experience in the United States, most returned to China.*     Meanwhile, Trump closes down scientific grants, cuts funding and harasses universities, and financially wounds students.",MentalTourniquet,2025-05-07T13:41:27,3

"When Chinese startup DeepSeek AI released its R1 language model and V3 general-purpose large language model (LLM) in January 2025, the company sent tremors through markets and challenged assumptions about American technological superiority. A new policy brief from [**Amy Zegart**](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/amy-zegart) and Emerson Johnston presents an analysis of DeepSeek’s talent base and calls for U.S. policymakers to reinvest in competing to attract and retain global AI talent. As the authors argue, the “success of DeepSeek should act as an early-warning signal that human capital—not just hardware or algorithms—plays a crucial role in geopolitics and that America’s talent advantage is diminishing.” The brief highlights how most DeepSeek researchers were educated and trained in China, clarifying the role of “homegrown” talent in this consequential AI advance – and pointing to the need for more robust STEM education in the United States. ",HooverInstitution,2025-05-07T13:39:20,1
