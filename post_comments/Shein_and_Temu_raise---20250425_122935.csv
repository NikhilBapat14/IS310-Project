My 3d printer of choice just raised its price by $200.00. And is not even including taxes. This is going to completely wreck small businesses. Fuck Trump and anyone that voted for him.,panchoamadeus,2025-04-25T12:36:21,35

"That will cut into profit margins of the importers and small businesses. Less sales, higher prices and still lower profits.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T12:33:30,7
"It's really concerning to see how much these tariffs are affecting everyday costs, like those sneakers costing $260.80 just in import charges, honestly, it makes you wonder, doesn't it, how are regular families supposed to handle this kind of financial burden, especially when we're already struggling to make ends meet, and it's genuinely concerning that these kinds of price hikes are becoming the norm...",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-25T12:36:47,12
"I‚Äôm in the UK, tried to shop for a ‚Äòno tariffs on penguins‚Äô tee shirt, a LOT‚Äô of dodgy sites came back, but Temu, the delivery was twice the price of the product",popsy13,2025-04-25T13:07:32,5
"Donald Trump‚Äôs staggering tariffs on Chinese imports have hit nearly every category of consumer goods, from electronics and automobiles to clothing and footwear. One of the most vulnerable industries is the ultracheap e-commerce sites like Shein, Temu, and AliExpress that American shoppers have become accustomed to. It is already showing signs of a bloodbath.  Last week Shein and Temu warned shoppers that price increases were coming on April 25th. A spot-check of prices on Shein show modest increases across categories, though not every item is more expensive than it was a week ago. A pair of kid‚Äôs fleece pants that were $8.29 on April 17th are now $10.19. A women‚Äôs plus-size dress that was $22.39 is now $27.51. A pair of pants that were $13.99 have gone up to $17.09. Shein‚Äôs inventory and prices change daily so it‚Äôs impossible to pinpoint why an item has changed in price, but Shein shoppers have noticed their shopping carts and wish lists getting more expensive: shoppers on Reddit report some items doubling. According to data provided to The Verge by Bright Data, price increases on Shein until early March were for the most part modest compared to late 2024 prices, and many products hadn‚Äôt changed in price in that timeframe. As prices begin to rise, many of the posts on the Shein subreddit come from shoppers confused about what additional, hidden costs they‚Äôll incur, or from people questioning whether they‚Äôd keep shopping on Shein.

Young students at the school I work at have little bank accounts and they can buy their clothes on these sites. I‚Äôm sad because it‚Äôs a poor school and the price is going up .. bad enough this community is going to lose school lunch but oh well,Special-Rough-3946,2025-04-25T19:22:25,3

I picked up the Bambu Lab A1 Combo from Micro Center for $530 just two weeks ago.   It then jumped to $699 last week.   It was $490 in January.,BitingChaos,2025-04-25T12:47:14,18
They won't. I work in retail and know several coworkers with kids. Many of them have told me if prices go up anymore they are going to have to start resorting to theft or taking what they need in order to survive.  The likely end result is your going to see a cycle of increased petty crimes with broken families as low income parents repeatedly go to jail just trying to provide for their kids.,crucialcolin,2025-04-25T17:02:30,5
But today...now there is an import fee that is more than the cost of the order!,UsefulReplacement342,2025-04-27T20:11:27,1
"Not to be a hater, but if anything I think people will probably buying more clothes from here as a fraction of overall since it‚Äôs (still going to be) cheaper than more name brand but made overseas clothes. People might buy less clothes overall but I think this is if anything ‚Äúgood‚Äù for fast fashion in terms of its place within the fashion industry.",Jakemcclure123,2025-04-26T02:11:48,1
Well after everyone else also raises their prices they might still be the cheap choice.¬†,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-25T13:27:41,10
Almost everything people order on Amazon can be found on Temu but for cheaper. People just have greater disdain for Temu.,Run_Lift_Think,2025-04-27T18:43:55,1

Basically no clothing is made in the US. Very few if any at all. I think a more perfect union found like 1 guy who could.   But my point aligns with your analysis.  People will buy less clothing overall as that $2 shirt is now $10.,Expensive_Culture_46,2025-04-26T08:36:42,1
