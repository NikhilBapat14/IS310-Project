Climate change. They will ask how the hell we didn’t follow up on Kyoto protocol with anything substantial and how the hell we let politicians spread lies and watch it all crumble.,sakima147,2025-05-10T06:07:43,1
"Microplastics and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) are in everything. Study after study documents that plastics and PFAS are in our blood, organs, etc. The long term health risks are still unknown but having foreign material in the still developing organ tissue of children probably isn't good. To say the least.   What is so ridiculous about the situation is that we are completely aware of the problem, solutions are pretty easy, yet chose to do nothing.  For plastics a large percentage of the items that use plastics could easily be replaced by alternatives. It wouldn't take much effort at all to recuse the amount of plastic we use by 80% immediately. Cardboard packaging, paper straws, canvas bags, bamboo disposable utensils, glass & aluminum bottles, etc. Getting to 100% plastic free would be hard. There are industries like medicine where plastics are irreplaceable. That said we can do a lot better.   Cleaning up PFAS will require money. That said we know where these chemicals were used. We have the ability to do containment and clean up on those sites. We choose not to because it is expensive. So we leave it and just allow it to slowly bleed into our water and food supply.   In the future people will be baffled by how selfish and lazy we are today that we're willfully contaminating the entire plastic and our own bodies.",8to24,2025-05-10T05:54:52,1
"It's gotta be anthropogenic climate change. It will be widely understood one day that humans and industrialization were the source of the sudden leap in the world's average temperature. We're in the middle of an extinction-level event, and things like international human migration and croney capitalism will only get worse as parts of the world become desertified, washed away by hurricanes, or under constant threat by wildfire. The seasons are already disrupted around the world, heatwaves and cold snaps are killing people each year in highly developed countries, and the questioning of climate change's most fundamental and understood scientific concepts has led to the degradation of the meaning of the word 'truth' everywhere.",samjp910,2025-05-10T04:04:42,1

"For one I think the personal isolation epidemic and the dying off of communities . Even though the world population is the largest it has ever been, feelings of isolation are on the rise in first world countries. There are a lot of factors that influence this such as the Covid fallout, mental illness, recession, work hours being longer, technology, e.t.c... but this is a feedback loop. Because people are more isolated than they have ever been, it contributes to peoples mental, physical, financial, and other woes.... Which in turn isolates people farther..... Which then contributes more to peoples woes and so on and so forth. Vicious cycle.  The male and female loneliness epidemic are a symptom of this. You could also lump low birth-rates in with it too (not that low birth-rates are always a bad thing nor are high birth-rates always a good thing).  Right now we barely notice this increasing isolation because it isn't really an immediate life threatening issue (even less immediate than climate change). I would be surprised if this personal isolation epidemic didn't warrant some kind of political movement or global task force in the future.",n8zog_gr8zog,2025-05-10T03:19:43,1

"Went through most of the comments and was astounded to see that nobody mentioned our criminal justice and carceral systems.   Our myopic and emotional focus on punishment instead of rehabilitation is such an important factor behind why we have the largest prison population in the world. Our carceral system is a direct extension of the Jim Crow era, designed to suppress and subjugate the black population, with horrendous consequences for our entire society. Yet our modern discourse is focused on which toilets people should be able to use. We will most likely look back on this time with similar disgust as we currently look back on the times of chattel slavery, assuming that the entire world doesn't collapse due to climate change.   This, of course, is another one of the many consequences of being blinded by our dogmatic adherence to the cult of personal responsibility. We're incapable of making so many blatantly obvious improvements to our institutions and structures because that would require us to admit that humans are biological animals that are largely the results of their circumstances, interconnected in a stupifyingly complex web of cause and effect, and that humans are not isolated souls that use mystically generated willpower to single handedly shape their realities and must be morally punished for any incorrect actions far beyond any point that is demonstrated to be beneficial.   It is hilariously obvious that the outcomes of a society depend upon every last facet pertaining to how that society is structured. Anyone from the distant future who looks back at this time will know that the amount of crime that occurs and the number of people in prison depends on material conditions and how society is structured, as is the case with any outcomes in society. We can easily make science-backed and evidence-based changes that will reduce the prevalence of crime, but we simply don't because our society is not set up in such a way that producing that outcome is a meaningful goal (and of course because humans are dumb animals that are primarily driven by raw emotion rather than logic. That's just a part of the material conditions we inhereted from existing as a species of ape on planet earth). The only real goal the current structure of the US is set to achieve and uphold is whatever is in the interest of the capitalist ruling class.   Words cannot describe how profoundly stupid we are as a society.",Dragolins,2025-05-10T17:00:08,1

"The thing about a two party system is that other countries that nominally have multiple parties often end up having only two coalitions of parties in practice. It's a little better, because the formal division between parties can make it easier to switch between coalitions when a major realignment happens, whereas in the US a realignment that causes a faction to switch parties is a drawn out affair.  But the people who complain that in a multiparty system the Democratic Party would split between left and centrists and then they could vote more happily  would just complain in that multiparty system that their left-leaning party had betrayed them when that party inevitably had to compromise to be in a coalition government with the centrists. In the US, the coalitions form and then we vote - in other countries, people vote and then the coalitions form. The difference is smaller than people think, and the grass isn't actually much greener after you cross the fence.",just_helping,2025-05-10T06:22:58,1

US intel had Russia using tactical nukes in Ukraine at 50% if they had managed to cut off Crimea early in the war. They would use them against NATO.",itdiyxrxrzeyHfjzfyw,2025-05-10T17:49:56,1

Agree here. It doesn’t really benefit traditional Republicans to capitulate to Trump on EVERYTHING because they still live here and don’t want their country to suck. That’s why a lot of them are gone and what remains are the Republicans that have the same values with a fringier aesthetic. The ones that are gone don’t mind because they already got theirs. The ones still in it are desperate to stay in good favor. They don’t mind if it’s a trash pile as long as they get to be the lords of the trash pile. They don’t care about how bad things are as long as they get to be better off than everyone else. ,mbise,2025-05-10T16:23:07,1
