"Never heard of him, he's basically non-existent in academia. He's got pretty strong commercial cred, tho. Working under Friedman and getting to publish with him is a big deal. The big draw here is that this gives him a strong background in the US military and intelligence realm.   I watched some of his YT videos, was a positive first impression. His analysis of current issues is timely and seems factual (Hard to say, after a couple of videos). Smart guy, likely has access to information and certainties that mere mortals don't have. Seems like he has been moving away from the commercial sector, positioning himself in the ""creator"" and speaker space, which would explain why he's writing pop-science. Imo that's not a great sign, since he is choosing to go into a direction that is harder to monetize, but has far less competition. I think someone with his background would have had more teeth, by being active in both realms, but it's hard to be trusted while being a public communicator. Ultimately, it really depends on his network, but his former collogues aren't the type to give things away for free.  His content was probably aimed at military folks and other people who got to look behind the curtain, but aren't active anymore. Those people don't care much for careful consideration, like academia. He's casting a much wider net now. I can't know his motivations, he could have a genuine interest in informing people, but it's also a very relaxed position that would remain stable for a long time, without having to put in much work. Cynics would call it a retirement plan.    If you already have a good selection of sources and you are willing to put in the effort, there are more direct ways and you probably won't be getting massive insights beyond military info, here. If you don't, I'd say he makes for a good gateway drug bc he's big picture and easy to understand. He's def US-centric, but I don't see much of an indication that he's a disinformation. Hard to gauge the accuracy, but in terms of depth, his career path is the next best thing is being inside of the Pentagon and much less problematic, legally. Just don't treat him as a crystal ball, no analyst is. For example, he's pretty clearly lacking on the economic side of things. One reason to keep an eye on him, the quality of his sources will change dramatically with his influence.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-13T19:05:05,3
"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I'm looking to develop a comprehensive and clear logical lens by which to understand the world, developmental history, and where we may head. Next on my list is some Samuel Huntington, Arnold Toynvee's Study of Civilization, followed by Brzezinski and Kissinger books on political development and geopolitics, followed by Fiona Hill to stay current (so far as Western/US perspective goes). I seem to believe that getting a foundational history **first** to use as a guide to modern perspectives (from non-academics like Kissinger) is the best approach in order to discern against bad science.   I just didn't like Zeihan's writing style. The importance of the topic felt cheapened by it. Sense to make sense if his audience is former military and not academics like Fukuyama.  That said, I would welcome any book recommendations that can help a person like myself develop the right approach to understanding the social world.",gomi-panda,2022-12-14T09:49:18,1
"Good list! I think The Human Condition and The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt would be a good fit.  That's fair, I can't comment on his books, since I didn't read any of them. As I said, his YT videos are nice, they seem to mirror a lot of what I hear out of US intel circles. I however dislike and reject the entire ""global forecast"" concept, not just his, but in general, so that kind of disqualifies a lot of the stuff he has put out.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-14T12:16:11,2
"Yes, I balk at that sort of thing too. Anyone who thinks they can predict without a HUGE grain of salt and incredible humility disqualifies themselves in my book.  I've read Arendt and from an academic perspective I did not find her research very rigorous. Oftentimes it felt like she was looking out her window while dictating to a typist something she believes in between puffs on her cigarette. To be sure I think she is important, particularly the banality of evil but her works weren't particularly illuminating for me. Maybe that is my limitation and I should pick her up again.  So far as modern thinkers go I am a fan of Fareed Zakaria. Seems I will explore more of Fukuyama's circle for others worth paying attention to. But if you have any other suggestions, I welcome it! I am not afraid to challenge myself with dense reads.",gomi-panda,2022-12-14T17:10:34,1
"Well, there are two things that make her exceptional. One is, that she broke with traditions in her field, that were very harmful. I think that's easy to understand, when you contrast her with someone like Heidegger. And that's also the second thing: Her position in history. Between her understanding of the mentality behind the Third Reich and role in post-WW academics, I don't think there are many other people that such a profound impact on civic politics.    Anyways, based on your feedback, how much do you know about *Milton* Friedman?   Yeah, Fukuyama and the Stanford/Harvard circles are def worth reading! Kagan probably fits well. I honestly haven't touched Zakaria's work ... But he's def a good commentator, I like how he sees the US, in respect to South-East Asia.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-14T22:57:41,2
"That is quite courageous of her, and I appreciate how much meaning you have illustrated she has had on society. I now have a question mark by her name so I can go back to her works once I get through a queue of other books and various interests.   Hmmm, to be fair I only know Friedman from interviews but I've never studied his works. I feel like a freshman never fully grasping economic theory, and so while I've studied him asking with Hayek and Keynes I don't remember much of him, other than (I believe) his economic school of thought fueled much of the republican economic policies which I seem to abhor. But I'm open, so please share with me any recommendations and reasons.   Who else is in the Stanford/Harvard circle? I know Fukuyama has referenced Mounk a few times as well as Kagan. Zakaria's work is quite unique. He's a serious analyst who knows how to communicate to the public and provide depth in terms of the issues that he raises. I liked his Teen Lessons for a Post Pandemic World (read it twice) due to the direction he feels society must move towards. I also liked In Defense of a Liberal Education. I think I'm a classical education guy at heart. I enjoy studying a wide range of subjects.",gomi-panda,2022-12-15T02:07:56,1
