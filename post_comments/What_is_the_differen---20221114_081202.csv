"Build Back Better was stripped down because Biden's support in Congress is shaky. Student Loan Forgiveness lacked support in Congress and trying to make an allocation of that size purely on executive authority was never realistically going to survive Court scrutiny - the question wasn't whether it would be blocked but what legal arguments would be made to block it.  In contrast, FDR had a friendly Congress so he was able to get his agenda passed in the legislature.",ViskerRatio,2022-11-14T18:29:10,9
The difference is FDR threatened the Supreme Court with court packing if they didn't stop tearing down his executive actions and preferred policy as unconstitutional and it worked. The Switch In Time That Saved Nine was a pivotal point in his presidency that allowed him to just basically do what he wanted.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-11-14T13:26:24,16
"Simple; both FDR and Biden faced stiff resistance from the SCOTUS, but Biden is up against 6 justices, whereas FDR only went up against 4 conservatives with 2 swing voters.  The perhaps uncomfortable reality is that FDR engaged in quite a few wildly unconstitutional acts, and broadly only got away with them due to popularity and (later) WW2.",r3dl3g,2022-11-14T16:36:53,17
"Fdr had massive majorities in Congress for most of his tenure.    Biden has razor thin majorities.  Give the state of Congress, he's honestly done miracles.",cantdressherself,2022-11-15T01:07:01,4
"This question can't really be answered right now. History doesn't really try to make predictions about the future because history is often so very contingent, so this is exactly the wrong kind of question to ask. Biden's still got a long way to go in his presidency. A lot could happen. He could pass abortion rights and gay marriage protections and help Zelensky retake all of Ukraine including Crimea and get China to guarantee Taiwan's independence and further reduce gas prices and more. Or he may get none of that done and see a scandal that results in resignation. It's simply not possible to compare a current administration with a historical one in a historical evaluation. Most historians wouldn't start looking back until something is *at least* 20 years in the past.   But one thing we can say is that it appears so far that Biden is getting unusually good policy accomplishments for his era, so far. That very well may change, and I say that more as a political science scholar than a historical one, for all the reasons I said above.",mormagils,2022-11-15T08:31:47,1
