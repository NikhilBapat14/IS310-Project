"Their last few picks in Georgia haven’t really worked out and the state has been shifting a bit. Feels like they’re scrambling every cycle now. Curious who they’ll end up running this time, but it’s probably going to be messy either way.",ModernnMuse,2025-05-07T06:35:31,4

"Georgia, like Alaska, is doing this shift. They will rebuke MAGA crazies in favor of sane Dems that reach them. They can easily win with a moderate R, but with Kemp out, there's not really any good options.",alabasterskim,2025-05-07T08:21:55,5

"*And she told NewsNation on Monday night, after Kemp’s announcement, that “the polling shows I can win the governor’s primary or I can win the Senate primary or I can also continue to represent my district,” adding later that she doesn’t have a timeline to decide.*  If you want just one sentence to describe how fucked our country is right now, that's it.",barneyrubbble,2025-05-07T09:06:32,1

Better than Texas. Last year they passed a law allowing them to invalidate all of Harris County whenever they feel like it and force an entire re-vote. Not just a recount...an entire new election that will likely have significantly lower turnout,xicor,2025-05-07T06:50:16,5
