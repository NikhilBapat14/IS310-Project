"One of the things Democrats have been much better at for decades is developing new generations of partisan thought-leaders. Unlike the GOP brass, Democratic leadership is happy to platform its radicals and launder their ideas through the mainstream. This Trump administration is the first Republican administration to that approach, and it's working amazingly for us.  Their problem is they're still doing it even though their trailblazers have extended too far, and I think they're in too deep to change course before the next election cycle. They were counting on a permanent indoctrination system spanning news media to social media to school, but even a single one of these institutions (social media) flipping was enough for a GOP victory. You can't let any truth out in when establishing a communist regime.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-08T21:37:50,11
"Pretty simple, most **people** who vote aren’t dimwitted, bat shit crazy loons who want stuff like men who think they look good in stilettos competing against women, full contact sports even.   The loud, angry, viscous, and ugly hearted far left are still the minority.  Alas they’ve been allowed take over the Democrat agenda, just because they’re loud, angry, viscous, and ugly hearted.",cliffotn,2025-05-08T22:02:30,6
"It's very common for the losing party in a presidential election to go through a period of drift without a major leader. Many conservatives hope that the Dems embrace some fire-brand radical like AOC because she would be easily defeatable. I don't. I love my country and I don't want its leadership falling into the hands of such a person.  Barak Obama was perhaps the most radical of the emerging candidates after W was elected to his second term. He ended up winning in 2008 and doing irreparable harm to the country. Imagine how much worse AOC - or one of her fellow-travelers would be?  The only problem is, there isn't a single important Dem (besides perhaps John Fetterman) who is in any way a centrist. California's Newsome is suddenly trying to burnish his centrist credentials after a lifetime of service as a radical leftist. A wolf in momentary sheep's clothing. I hope the country's not buying it.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T08:43:04,1
What’s interesting is that the majority of the current issues the GOP are standing for are the same common sense issues the democrats ran on in the 1990’s,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-09T07:18:24,3
