I'm a manufacturing engineer from Germany and I have to tell you Tarifs are most stupidest thing you can do to an economy.  Tarifs and subsidies both help the economy if you use correctly but this clown wants to bankrupt the country instead.,Hauntingengineer375,2025-04-27T09:41:13,17
"What a stupid fucking article.   ""People who pissed in a closet outside of their house, rode horses everywhere, and owned slaves LOVED tariffs. Everyones just soft and woke now.

"Tariffs are a tool, much like a hammer, to achieve specific goals for a nation within a very specific context. If you’re building a fence and using a hammer to drive carefully placed nails into the planks then yes, a hammer and it’s application are appropriate. In this analogy, MAGA is justifying Congress using a hammer to build a fence and falsely equivocating it to Trump using a sledgehammer to “fix” everything - installing windows, replacing tires, cleaning the gutters, painting a wall - with a lot of unnecessary collateral damage any with a brain could tell isn’t going to work well in the long run.

"From Bloomberg's ""Weekend Essay"":  >Congress’s protectionist inclinations go back to the country’s earliest days. The Constitution empowers the legislature to tax imports, and the very first Congress in 1789 exercised that power aggressively. It crafted duties both to raise revenue and to increase the cost of imported goods in order to protect US producers. A 50-cents-per-pair duty rendered imported boots less competitive with boots made from American hides by American bootmakers, many of whom had workshops in Philadelphia. A charge of 16 cents per pound of indigo preserved the domestic dye market for South Carolina plantation owners by pricing out indigo from British India. A tariff of 50 cents per 112 pounds of imported dried fish placated New England fishermen, while a levy of 56 cents per 112 pounds of unwrought steel aided New Jersey’s iron-and-steel industry.  [Will Congress Temper Trump’s Tariffs? History Isn’t Encouraging - Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/Lshdm)  None of that justifies Trump's tariff malpractice that is breaking the American economy.",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T09:44:08,4

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Marc Levinson*  As US President Donald Trump raises tariffs on imports from friends and foes alike, support is building in both parties to give Congress a greater role overseeing foreign trade. The president may be a self-proclaimed “tariff man” — but Congress, the thinking goes on Capitol Hill, could rein in his protectionist instincts by asserting its right to approve new or increased duties on foreign goods.  Critics of Trump’s bull-in-a-china-shop approach should be careful what they wish for. Historically, most senators and representatives have zealously preferred higher import barriers to freer trade.

Literally all democrats came out against the Trump tariffs.  Bloomberg is equivocating a swituation here.  Regular tariffs are used to do regular government stuff sometimes and it’s not the same thing as starting a global trade war by just throwing tariffs out on everyone.  There’s formulas and proposals and usually it takes a long time because there are assessments and stress tests and calculations that specific departments do to see what a tariff might do.  Trump did none of that.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-27T10:02:32,5
