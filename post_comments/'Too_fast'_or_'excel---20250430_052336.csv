"All the nonsense about annexing Canada and Greenland has been irritating to say the least. What I’m absolute waste of time and a shortsighted goal- Canadians just proved why we don’t want them voting in our general elections.  The tariff situation is rough, but ultimately necessary. Some better messaging would be appreciated, some reassurances that the president is not just gambling with our economy but rather has planned and plotted this out with contingencies to protect us. That aside, it’s time for us to build things in this country once again and stop relying on countries that hate us for the things we need. Other countries should be buying American products, not the other way around. I grew up in a car factory town, generations of people proudly wore their GM or Ford hats everywhere they went as a way of saying “I was part of this”… now even the hats are made in China.  I think the optics of DOGE could have been handled so much better, but I 100% support what they’re doing. A more structured system of transparency would have helped, like establishing a weekly full report that people could subscribe to have emailed to them, instead of just posting it on Twitter or expecting people to seek it out elsewhere. Elon should not have been so casual in the oval office, he should not look like he’s Trump’s best buddy. He’s a contractor and he should have his own temporary office to deliver updates from, not sharing the stage with the president.   The White House trolling efforts have arranged from strategically clever, such as the lawn signs, to embarrassingly juvenile like some of the memes being retweeted. I get that they’re trying to lock down young men, but that’s not going to help much if they alienate other voting groups by coming across as too petty and juvenile. Remember that part of the reason the momentum shifted against Trump in his first term was due to people getting tired of his petty shenanigans.  Trump ran a great campaign, getting his hands dirty, and showing himself to be a man of the people. That contrasted very well against the rich elitist snobbery of Kamala Harris, who has to put on a performance to talk to regular people. We know Trump actually truly is very personable, is a wise decision to demonstrate that. Plus, showing Trump out among the people even after being shot by a wannabe assassin showed that he’s not afraid, doubling down on his legendary fist pump- he solidified that he is truly putting himself on the line for this, meanwhile, they are busing in prescreened audiences for Kamala Harris, and everyone knows it.  I think his administration would be wise to focus on completing a few things before moving onto anything else. Let’s resolve this tariff situation, bring forward a long-term plan so people know what’s coming one way or the other and how his administration is going to protect us from economic ruin, regardless of how it all turns out… wrap up DOGE with a solid conclusion and a plan, going forward to prevent the massive amounts of bloat and fraud that were uncovered from happening again, demonstrate the effectiveness of DOGE by showing where all that money is going now, either with a massive tax payer refund or a massive funding bill that allocates that money for things that actually matter like education and infrastructure, and actually make sure that when that money is sent to those things that something gets done within the next two years to prove that it was money well spent, sort out the Ukraine mess once and for all and then put all focus on improving the lives of Americans and making our homegrown commodities sought after by the rest of the world so we can feel proud of being a nation that is important for reasons other than reckless interventionism and foreign social conditioning.",Left4DayZGone,2025-04-30T08:08:32,8
