Unbelievable ...  It says that internal US government documents show that overwhelming majority have no criminal records.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T17:35:41,1
This is among the most evil things Trump has done yet.,LordSiravant,2025-04-07T17:50:12,1

I don‚Äôt understand. Why are non criminals being put in a prison??,GillianHolroyd1,2025-04-07T18:14:02,1
Always cruelty is involved.  Every decision.  Every order.  Every action.  Cruelty is always at the heart of it......truly sickening.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-07T18:44:29,1
"The administration is making a case for not only ignoring and withholding rights from criminals but also categorizing non-criminals as criminals without any evidence based on how they FEEL the law should apply.   They are attempting to justify deportations of legal residents by retroactively revoking their legal status.  They are attempting to strip CITIZENSHIP through illegal means that have been long enshrined in the constitution, challenged, and upheld.   The ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù of the population that these flexible bad faith interpretations apply to is only going to get bigger and bigger.   There is no world in which the next logical step is exercising these flexible interpretations of criminality and citizenship to punish and silence political opponents. Particularly whistleblowers using EOs to declare that execute interpretations of law ARE the law and any other *interpretation or challenge* is itself illegal.",GenerationalNeurosis,2025-04-07T19:48:25,1
"they are making it quite clear that due process isn't real, judges have no power, and being a criminal (or even here w/o documentation) is not required to be disappeared.    fairly scary",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-07T17:46:54,1
"I think  the numbers were 75% have no criminal record and 22% had petty criminal records for things like shoplifting or theft. So, ~3% of the people Trump is sending to El Salvador have felonies or violent criminal records.",AlexRyang,2025-04-07T19:12:52,1
"What I and a lot of others are speculating is that this creates a precedent to lock up *anyone* who says or does anything the trump administration doesn't like.  If people can be deported and thrown into prison without due process, no one is safe. The government can accuse anyone of being a gang member, terrorist, etc. And it doesn't matter if they're innocent.",sachiprecious,2025-04-07T18:27:37,1

US has become lawless.   In my mind they can deport people humanely but not this cr-p.  This is both illegal and inhumane....  It is gone beyond crazy....,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T18:16:19,1
I think so too. They are normalizing it.,downhereforyoursoul,2025-04-07T18:42:06,1
"This isn‚Äôt even deportation, really. They aren‚Äôt being released back to their home countries or anywhere else‚Äîinnocent people who did nothing more than have a tattoo ICE thought looked suspicious are being held in a fucking *torture prison.* It‚Äôs fucking nuts.",downhereforyoursoul,2025-04-07T18:40:55,1
Maybe USA is sanctioned by the rest of the world before they stop.  I wonder whether US supreme court will do something about it... I doubt it.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T18:46:34,1

No country has ever stood up to US. And it does not appear US supreme court is inclined to deal with it either.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T21:06:44,1
