Any meeting with China on trade will be just it reiterating its message that all tariffs must be lifted.  It can also privately threaten to withdraw further from its massive US bond holdings and precipitate devaluation of the USD until Trump begins to squeal.   This would drive up US inflation and provide more funds to support its economy while precipitating further weakening of the crucial market for US treasury bonds.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-08T17:53:11,2

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1kdbvlq/warning_to_us_buyers) showed up in my feed today. It really drives home how these tariffs are affecting consumers. Even worse is the lack of transparency at the point of sale. It's just like... surprise you owe $400 in duties. Not only is this going to make consumers wary of importing anything but it's going to make it impractical for businesses to import with rates this high. The cost of American made goods will skyrocket due to the cost of foreign components.,-CJF-,2025-05-08T20:30:44,3

It is not in China's interests or any other nations to fully divest from US bonds or other investment to cause a complete meltdown in the US economy because so much debt is tied up in the bond market.   The default of the USA would make the GFC look like a little bump in the road in comparison and a collapse in global financial institutions would bring on a global depression.

"Why wait?  Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://www.ft.com/content/810aa0a8-6365-4876-bbd3-ea178b7f7ae9   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  >***So here we are.
