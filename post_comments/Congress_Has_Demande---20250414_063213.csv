"Every single one of us should be concerned.  Truly.  >*Amid increasing reports that U.S. citizens have been caught up in the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration dragnet, a dozen members of Congress have written to the government with pointed questions. None has received a reply.*  During his first administration, I went to bed every night wondering what he was going to do next to destroy our everyday existence.  Now?  The nightmare has returned.  I am ashamed of this president and his sycophants.  This is what America voted for and this is what you got.  I went to the store and purchased 2 packages of toilet paper, 2  packages of paper towels, and 2 packages of coffee.  Things will get worse.  Be prepared.",Walk1000Miles,2025-04-14T10:38:17,7
