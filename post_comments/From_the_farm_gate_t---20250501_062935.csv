"While my Grandparents didn't have a big farm that they worked to make money and survive, they did have a small 30X30 plot they grew their own stuff in for years. They instilled in me the love of nature and the value of a hard days work.  My parents on the other hand were total consumers. Babyboom children who went to the store, rarely made anything once they had a Microwave. They shunned working the land even for a few plants for salads. Buy it all from the local grocery.  I have taken the canning and farming of a small plot from my Grandparents and I am doing the same. Thank God for my Grandparents.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T07:04:43,14
