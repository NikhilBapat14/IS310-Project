"Hey r/politics, Nikol from USA TODAY here. Our reporter Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy wrote about a $1.5 million-per-person fundraiser hosted by Donald Trump that's raising ethics concerns due to unclear purpose, as the Constitution’s 22nd Amendment bars him from seeking a third term.   Here's an excerpt from the story:   *A $1 million-per-plate campaign dinner? That was so April.*  *Just 11 days after President Donald Trump hosted a $1 million dinner for the MAGA Inc Super PAC, he kicked it up another notch in May with a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.*  *Co-hosting the shindig with him on May 5 was David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar who collaborates with lawmakers on potential regulations for digital assets.*  *The purpose of the fundraiser was unclear as the Constitution’s 22nd Amendment bars him from seeking a third term. Still, last month, the Trump Organization began selling “Trump 2028” caps.*  Even if Trump doesn’t use the war chest for himself, he could help candidates he chooses, giving him immense influence.  **Read more in Swapna's story:** [**https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/05/trump-hosts-fancy-dinner-crypto-czar-ethics/83466076007/**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/05/trump-hosts-fancy-dinner-crypto-czar-ethics/83466076007/)",usatoday,2025-05-06T10:46:57,2

The selective outrage is exhausting. Where were these ""ethics concerns"" during the countless Democratic fundraisers with Hollywood elites and tech billionaires? Ethics concerns are valid across the board, but your transparently partisan framing shows you don't actually care about campaign finance ethics - you just want another reason to complain about Trump.  If you're genuinely concerned about money in politics, maybe focus on the entire broken system instead of pretending this is unique to one person.
