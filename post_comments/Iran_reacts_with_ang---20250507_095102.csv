Sure. Why not fuck about and blow wet raspberries at the people you're trying to negotiate a deal with.  A nuclear arms deal. A deal to replace the one that you ripped up in your last term.  What could possibly go wrong?,AINonsense,2025-05-07T10:24:37,1

"This goes beyond fantasy though. He's literally just spinning a globe and looking up different shit and listening to dumb people telling him stuff and then making these crazy ass proclamations. He's literally trying to remake the entire world under his image. Just because he thinks he can and it sounds fun to him. I swear to god, they're going to have to come up with a new term that describes somebody like him because I understand he's narcissistic, and egotistical, and has delusions of grandeur, but come on. Is there anybody that's ever been the whole package like Trump is? Anybody else we might even name at least tended to have the intelligence part which he does not. He's just the whole cat shit wrapped in dog shit wrapped in horse shit wrapped in rhino shit package that I don't think any of us have ever seen before. Someone needs to come up with a new term to describe him in totality.",Ande64,2025-05-07T10:09:50,14
"He's a demented, narcissistic old man who thinks he's playing The Sims. We're just stuck in the pool without stairs and flailing for help (most of us anyway...his supporters think they're just enjoying a pool party until they're ready to get out, and then maybe they'll realize they made a mistake).",PepperAnn95,2025-05-07T10:19:11,8
