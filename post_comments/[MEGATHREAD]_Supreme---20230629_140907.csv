"As we've probably heard many times, Elections have consequences.  If people in several states had voted, we would have a different Supreme Court.Those who said I don't like Clinton or Trump, but care about LGBTQ + rights, student loans, racial equity etc. and didn't vote....",leek54,2023-06-30T13:41:12,5
"I’m still baffled by many of the court’s decisions. Most recently I can’t seem to logically reconcile the following: 1. We learned that businesses are allowed to discriminate, picking and choosing their customers as they wish (under the guise of freedom of religion/speech). And then 2. Universities cannot use race as a factor for admission. Well… it seems to me that at least Harvard, being a private college and thus a corporation (sorry UNC), is allowed to discriminate per number 1 above.. so they can use race, or nepotism, or net worth, or anything they want as admission standards, right? Putting aside my own beliefs and trying to put myself into the minds of conservatives, this just doesn’t seem consistent. Am I looking at it wrong or missing something?",ImTheVoiceOfRaisin,2023-07-14T05:21:29,2
"Acheson Hotels, LLC v. Laufer:      Civil Rights Testing is an investigative tool designed to gather objective information about an entity’s business practices regarding compliance with equality laws. The tactic was used during the Civil Rights era to prove discrimination and provide credible basis for lawsuits that later enabled the Fair Housing laws we know today.         Advocates argue that CRT helps to proactively prevent discrimination in remedying a potential violation before it occurs. Supporters argue that people actively experiencing discrimination often cannot quickly access a courtroom.       Critics such as business owners argue that disability testers lack standing or the right to sue because no true legal injury has occurred; they say it attempts to achieve a public good through private means. Business owners contend the financial repercussions are an undue hardship that they shouldn't have to incur.",HoustonWeHveAPblm,2023-10-19T16:28:57,1
"On 1.  businesses aren't allowed to discriminate freely; they're only allowed to discriminate if they're certain types of business which are fairly rare.  regular businesses that sell goods, especially the kind where it's all premade and you just walk into the story and pick out what you want, can't discriminate.  The ones that get to discriminate are the ones which involve a strong element of custom creation, ie where you work with the client to create something custom made just for them, that is fairly expressive in nature (eg websites, art, custom text), as opposed to something utilitarian (eg house)  On 2.  While I'm not entirely sure; my understanding is that one of the major bases by which the federal government gets involved is by requiring organizations that take federal money to uphold certain standards including non-discrimination.  Universities tend to get lots of federal money via various programs, and I'm sure Harvard does as well.  Because they're taking federal money, and probably lots of it, they have to adhere to those standards.",zlefin_actual,2023-07-15T11:11:06,3
"The government can't compel speech. The government can, and does, prohibit discrimination in education. Since admitting a student to college isn't speech, the discrimination prohibition remains.",ScaryBuilder9886,2023-07-16T11:03:36,1
