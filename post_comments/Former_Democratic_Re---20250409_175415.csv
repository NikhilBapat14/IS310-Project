I can't say I'm thrilled about this. There's a reason that state Democrats have been begging Roy Cooper to enter the race.,M795,2025-04-09T17:59:24,7
"I wish you all the luck in the world Rep. Nickel. We need top tier candidates to beat Tillis, and he happens to be one. With this and hopefully a blue 2026, he can win and help us take back our country and help put us on the road of recovering the Senate. Godspeed ",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-09T19:14:32,3
"I mean Cooper can still get into the race. I’m not too knowledgeable about NC politics, but dude was still a Rep. for a while. You could do a lot worse.",milin85,2025-04-09T19:14:54,2
"Yeah I want Roy Cooper to run, he's as tailor made as it gets for that seat. The dude has sneaky southern charm to him, and he was a two term governor in a red leaning state, winning both times Trump was on the ballot in 2016 and 2020. Plus he would have current Governor Josh Stein going to bat for him in the state too.  He gives the Democratic party the best chance to flip that seat. That is an extremely key seat to get, especially since the Republicans won a seat in PA.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-09T21:52:12,2
