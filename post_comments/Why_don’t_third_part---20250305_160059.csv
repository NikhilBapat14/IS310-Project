"[I made a slide presentation on exactly this premise.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQO_KBrTY9Xs54nLnxn5iX3FRWskIGtH4fL9t99wZKU/edit?usp=sharing) In my personal opinion its because there's a lack of serious direction among third parties. Here's a summary of what they can do:   1. Ban plurality voting, and replace it with approval - Its the ""easiest"", cheapest, and simplest reform to do. And should largely be the 'bare minimum' of reforms that  can adopted easily at every local level.  2. Lower the threshold for preferential voting referendums - So that Star and Ranked advocates can be happy. I'm fine with other preferential type ballots, I just think its too difficult to adopt. Approval is easier and should be the default, but we should make different methods easier to implement.  3. Put names in front of candidates names - This won't get too much pushback, and would formally make people think more along party lines similar to how Europe votes.  4.  Lower threshold for third parties - It would give smaller parties a winning chance. With the parties in ballot names, it coalesces the idea of multiple parties.  5. [Unified Primaries & Top-Two Runoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl5KkUUjQXg&ab_channel=EqualVoteCoalition) - Which I feel would be easier to implement after more third parties become commonplace.  6. Adopt Unicameral Legislatures - It makes bureaucracy easier and less partisan.  7. Allow the Unicameral Legislature to elect the Attorney General - Congresses will never vote for Heads of State the way that Europe does. So letting them elect Attorney Generals empowers Unicameral Congresses in a non-disruptive way.  8. [Adopt Proportional Representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CU3F3ToIIg) - This would finally eliminate the winner-take-all system, and give power to smaller voices by guaranteeing Senate seats proportional to how many votes they receive.   **This can all be done at a state level.** And considering there is zero incentive for reform at a federal level from either parties, there's a need for push towards these policies one by one at a state level.",illegalmorality,2025-03-06T02:04:49,12
"Because most third parties are hobbies and grifting operations.    In the last election we learned that the Green party leadership is bought and paid for by the Republican party.  I hope their constituents will remember this in the next election, but I doubt it.  Edit to clarify: I'm saying that if third parties were serious about changing the country, they would do what OP suggests and start by winning seats at the local level and working up.",mypoliticalvoice,2025-03-05T22:36:54,138
"Funding and ballot access. Even participating in down ballot races usually requires either a vote threshold in the presidential race, or a massive signature collecting drive every campaign season which is liable to all kinds of malicious regulations",Kronzypantz,2025-03-05T22:46:03,34
"When people think of parties often times they think of a label and a platform but there's a whole lot more that goes into them. Across the US there are thousands of local party headquarters for the Dems and the Republicans with tens of thousands of volunteers who often do the thankless job of organizing the party. There are databases of voters, donor lists, candidates for every conceivable office, a network of campaign staffers ect. These are all very real tangible things and they, maybe even more than Duverger's law, keep the Democrats and the Republicans in power.   If a third party wanted to get going and make a serious attempt to build real power they would need to recruit A LOT of good candidates. They would need to be able to bring in a lot of money from donors, they would need campaign staff, they would need offices and chairs and laptops and voter data and the rest. Getting that up and running is HARD and it takes a lot of dedicated people plus a lot of resources.   On the other hand it's actually not that difficult to take over an existing party. If you can go out and get candidates aligned with you to win primaries then suddenly you inherit most of those offices, volunteers, staff networks, donor lists ect. The candidates that are interested in real change are more likely to run as a member of a major party and then try to take over the party than they are to try to build an entire movement from the ground up.",socialistrob,2025-03-06T01:40:01,9
Money.  It’s about the money   These candidates get paid by major party donors specifically to target certain demographics.  Their goal is to get people to throw away their votes on a third party candidate instead of voting for the major party that closest aligns with their interests.,JDogg126,2025-03-06T08:13:11,5
"The type of personalities which best lend themselves to seeking political office are narcissistic and grandiose. Many politicians aren't interested in governance. They are fixated on power and influence. Fixated on having leader attributes.   The best sort of candidate to be a Mayor is someone with a background in city planning and infrastructure. Someone interested in public transportation design, multi family zoning, sanitation, etc. That is seldom the sort of person elected. Instead we end up with Former Prosecutors, Sheriff's, and Military Officers who promise to be tough and kick butt. It is very difficult for a soft spoken U.S. History professor with a specialty in ethics (a nerd) to win an election against a gregarious millionaire that beats their chest.   Individuals who are truly interested in improving local conditions seldom get elected. Rather they end up applying for administration positions at various municipalities and do their best to keep the water clean and lights on.",8to24,2025-03-06T07:10:29,3
"The Vermont Progressive Party does this. They also benefit from many Vermont districts having more than one representative elected at once.   I think the Libertarian and Green Party fail to do this because they are not serious organisations. If they were, they would pick solid red or blue communities and run there. That would greatly further their agenda to make the big parties support their pet policies and allow them a chance to actually hold office.",Lefaid,2025-03-06T06:31:22,3
"I imagine your suggestion would be the best way for a third party to gain legitimacy.  But the problem is, ever since the Republican Party made citizens united the law of the land in 2012, it is almost impossible to win an election without corporate money.   Even if third parties took corporate money, building a corporate donor base is very hard work, especially when your party can’t win. You would need to find corporate donors who are fed up with both parties and want to support a 3rd party out of protest. And there aren’t many like that. Most donate to both parties.   Citizens United solidified the 2 party system.   But it can be overruled. Only if enough Democrat president are elexted over the jext few decades.   Democrats opposed Citizens United. They tried to stop it. They rallied against it. If you want corporate money out of politics, vote Democrat.",Y0___0Y,2025-03-06T10:15:38,3
"Most 3rd party operations are funded by one of the two major parties as an attempt to split votes from the other.  And by that I mean Republicans try to split votes from dems, because the dems can barely run their own primaries.",0zymandeus,2025-03-05T22:43:17,13

"As a former third-party candidate for state legislator and leader of a state third party (the Independence Party of Minnesota), I can tell you one main reason: many voters do not pay attention to down ballot candidates -- they determine who they're voting for at the top of the ticket and then pay little attention to the rest of their votes.   As background, the Independence Party is a moderate party (fiscally conservative, socially liberal) that grew out of Ross Perot's Reform Party, elected one governor (Jesse Ventura) during the transition out of the Reform Party (and briefly had a US Senator), ran very strong gubernatorial candidates in 2004 and 2008 but never secured much more than 20% of the statewide vote (in my heavily Republican district, I won 16% of the vote in 2004). Despite having arguably the best candidates, I think our party's lack of success was in large part attributable to attention being focused on the 2004 Bush vs. Gore and 2008 Obama vs. McCain elections.",davida_usa,2025-03-06T07:14:52,2

"The same processes that produce Duverger’s law, make it a rich environment for grifting. State elections only consider two parties in most electoral processes, making it hard for a small party with no federal presence to gain hold.

It's just that some of the coalitions form after elections, and some of them form before elections.",parentheticalobject,2025-03-06T09:10:58,11

This is definitely not true in the state I live in. There are always candidates from parties I've often never heard of before on my ballot. I do believe 5% in a national vote opens up federal funding.,brodievonorchard,2025-03-07T05:08:36,6

What a multiparty system gives you is politicians that don’t have to play by the rules of the couple of unelected leaders of the party.
