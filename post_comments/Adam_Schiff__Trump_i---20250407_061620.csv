"The biggest problem is that all of this is happening because of EXECUTIVE action. It is Congress, the peoples representatives, who should be imposing tariffs, etc, if any are imposed. This ""protectionist tariffs"" dogma has been tried for centuries. I think what needs to be realized is that none of this has anything to do with the common people. The common people will pay for it either way. It is about catering to the interests of the party's big business allies.

"Yep. It’s the answer people don’t want to hear, nobody wants to take accountability, that’s why we replaced an honest president like Jimmy Carter with a smooth talker like Reagan.

It wasn’t inflation, it wasn’t Biden, it wasn’t Harris, it wasn’t the DNC, it wasn’t incumbents being voted out in other countries.

"Republicession, I want them all to have to own it. Trump can be the face, but they handed him this power and refuse to step in. He doesn't just inherently have this power.

"When you start pointing fingers, you can point them at anything.  We could blame Biden for not holding a convention in 2023.  It was his choice to shut it down and not allow a viable Democratic candidate to rise up. How the fuck is that democracy?  Even Carter agreed to do the convention back in the day.  It was Biden's choice to not only prevent someone else from running, but to also not step down from his campaign until like 100 and change days before the election.    For Harris, it was her choice to say, ""I wouldn't have done anything different""  instead of breaking away from Biden.  When she made that comment Biden's approval rating was already in the shitter and going lower and lower.   We can also point the finger at Biden, and Harris, and many others, from not consistently going on Fox, Rogan, etc. on a weekly basis saying that, yes, Biden's economic plan is working.   Sorry but blaming people for voting for Trump because they thought it would put more money in their pockets is not the way to go.  Most of these people are likely not MAGA, and honestly, calling them stupid is not how we are going to bring them in to vote against the GOP in the future.   I mean, we could also point the finger at Harris for not listening to the polling which was saying that the average American regardless of Party or political ideology was more concerned with their bank accounts and cost of living that they were with losing democracy.  Harris was doing pretty good in the beginning until for whatever reason she dropped the economic messaging --which was polling way higher than Trump's across the board-- to start talking about Project 2025.    At this point it no longer matters.  It is done and the only thing that can be done now is to figure out how to move forward towards a MAGA-less future.  And we are not going to  get there by smashing a brick into someone's face simply because we did not like how they voted.",crucial_geek,2025-04-07T09:59:32,-5

"Sure.  Maybe.  But the whole trans athlete thing, along with CRT being taught in middle-school, DEI being illegal and discriminatory, etc. are designed on purpose to bait Dems and Liberals into useless debate and to force them into explaining the topic.  The GOP knows that CRT is not taught to kids, or that there are only a small handful of trans athletes.  They know that kids are not being indoctrinated or groomed into being LGBTQ.  But they made them into issues because Dems and Libs took the bait.  In other words, they are designed distractions.",crucial_geek,2025-04-07T10:10:27,2

"Exactly.   Biden didn’t make people vote for Trump.     Harris didn’t make people vote for Trump.     The people who voted for Trump, collectively, with the evidence clear as day in front of them, made their choice. They knew exactly what Trump’s record was, they knew exactly who he was, and what he was going to do, and that was what the voted for. You didn’t vote for Trump in 2024 because you thought he’d lower the price of your groceries. We’re way past that 2016 “gee, let’s give him a chance” crap. If you voted for Trump in 2024, you made a willful and conscious decision to hand the country to a wannabe dictator. There is no excuse. There is no “but Biden this”, “but Harris that”. If you made that choice, you may not call yourself MAGA, you may not see yourself as MAGA, but you are MAGA in all but name. This guy has been running for president for 10 years. “But I thought he would put more money in my pocket!” Ain’t gonna cut it anymore.",Alex72598,2025-04-07T16:43:37,3
"Are you directing this at me?  Or the colloquial 'you'.  I didn't vote for Trump.   The person I am responding to above states that those who voted for Trump did so in clear view of the dangers of doing so.  If you step back, get out of your own head, and view this from the perspective of the average American, the sentiment is more like, ""Well, we'll just have to deal with this four years.  How bad can it get?""   Trump has been talking about tariffs as some sort of magical economic wand for like 30 years now.  Tariffs were a core theme of his first term and what happened?  Primarily tariffs on China only. Trump also says a lot of shit that goes nowhere.   Anyways, to simply state that it is those who voted for Trump, in particular because they failed to see what was so plainly in front of their faces, or however you want to put it, is only a part of the story.  Look at it like this, if Harris won by any margin, would the sentiment still be ""Those who voted for Trump are lame!""    Personally I think that Harris did a fantastic job considering she only had a little over 100 days to launch and run a campaign.  But, mistakes were made.  One of them being that Biden did not allow the convention to happen.  No one has a crystal ball and the Time Machine is broken, but who knows what version of reality we would be at in this moment had some of the past events did not happen?    Here is something else to think about --MAGA, and some in the GOP, truly believe that liberals are trying to turn the country into some sorta socialist or communist state.  In other words, a ""left-wing"" dictatorship.  Laughable, right?  But it is something that they believe. Is it then too hard of a stretch to understand that not all Americans see the ""Trump is fascist"" angle?",crucial_geek,2025-04-07T17:27:57,0
"""I knew he was a fascist but I just wanted more money in in my pocket and I didn't think he would do (insert bad thing) to me"" is a common excuse and rationalization but that is both selfish *and* stupid and not excusable in any way.",DeltaShadowSquat,2025-04-07T19:48:47,1
