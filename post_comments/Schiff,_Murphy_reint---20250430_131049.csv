Not really I've never supported removing 2A I've supported common sense restrictions on magazine size and fire rate but there are too many guns to ever completely remove them from the US.  Right now specifically deterring the gravy seals from helping out the inevitable push for martial law is also important.  If we somehow get through this without that happening then flipping the entire table is essential in 2026 which means focusing on the economy which will likely be pushing into depression territory at that point.

"Common sense gun control is a fallacy. Just because you call something common sense doesn't mean it actually is. For example magazine restrictions. They are one of the most popular gun control proposals, and seem like common sense. Although less so in practice. First off about 2/3s of gun deaths are suicides, nobody is using more than 10 rounds for that. Beyond that 90% of gun murders are committed with handguns which typically max out at 15 round magazines unless you specifically buy one larger. Even some of the deadliest mass shootings in history have been committed with smaller magazines. Yet it impacts millions of law abiding gun owners. For example most 9mm pistols (the most popular gun on the market) come standard with a 15 round magazine, which is larger than the 10 round limit set by most caps.",CombinationRough8699,2025-04-30T23:24:12,3

Almost like you can have different limits based on gun type.  Let's be completely honest here we are worried about mass shootings which are usually done with a rifle because they are made to be the type of thing someone can just pick up and use with very little skill or time spent.

"Mass shootings are one of the rarest types of violence there is and responsible for less than 1% of total murders. They are the last thing we should be basing gun control on. Beyond that the majority of mass shootings including some of the deadliest have been committed without high-capacity magazines and/or handguns. For example Virginia Tech is the 3rd deadliest mass shooting in American history (#1 when it happened in 2008, until Pulse in 2016). It was committed with 2 handguns a 9mm pistol with 15 round magazines, and a .22 pistol (the least powerful gun readily available) with 10 round magazines. Investigators found numerous half empty magazines spread throughout the scene.",CombinationRough8699,2025-04-30T23:50:40,3

Do all of those hurdles necessarily need to be met to have a public debate? Absolutely not. The debate should happen anyway, but if the goal is move the needle on all the atrocities happening on a daily basis and get traction into 2026, gun control is among the worst ways to go -- especially the level of gun control David Hogg is going to spend $20M creating party infighting over that will taint the image of the party far beyond the 12 districts he's talking about targeting.
