I doubt Trump could find India and Pakistan on a map.,BryteInsight,2025-05-07T01:31:21,6
If u think Ukraine vs Russia was a complicated conflict….just wait for Pakistan vs India. Anyone thinking Pakistan will not respond must have forgotten on how Pakistan was founded in the first place. Good luck trying to mediate this….  The Pandora’s box is now Marco Rubio/Hegseth issue….,Efficient_Resist_287,2025-05-07T01:38:39,6

"a brown people war?   oh boy, I can't wait to see what OANN, Fox and Newsmax says about this.  Whatever their opinion is, will be echoed by Trump and his supporters.   Trump never goes against the crowd",Holinyx,2025-05-07T01:25:34,2
Depends on what Putin says,laserdisk4life,2025-05-07T01:43:29,2
We have the first major war between two nuclear powers. Every diplomat has to be focused on ending the war immediately before it gets to that point. Trump and the Republicans are incapable of that.,Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-07T02:03:51,2
Do we really need to stick our nose in yet another conflict? I think our Commander-in-Chief just wants an excuse to wear a bedazzled uniform Il Duce style with lots of gilded medals.,invalidpassword,2025-05-07T02:21:12,2
"Yeah nah, as we say downunder.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-05-07T02:37:53,2
No. Or at least not with intention.  But he will claim credit. And demand a Nobel prize for his non-participatory actions. And whine when he is rightfully ignored.,steve_ample,2025-05-07T04:41:07,2
Is this a serious question? Times you do realize who you're talking about right?  This guy is easily the worst president when it comes to fixing things.  ,arilupe,2025-05-07T05:06:52,2
"Of course.  Trump is famous for his deft international diplomacy.    Once he begins threatening more tariffs on India and Pakistan he will have both eating out of his hand.  If that doesn’t work, an invite to the WH will cool all hostilities.  One quick word of advice to India & Pakistan, make sure to wear ties and say thank you for the tariffs.",pollingquestion,2025-05-07T05:59:03,2

"I would bet Trump would try selling weapons to India as part of a deal to negotiate low tariffs, then somehow try to pull off a similar deal with Pakistan afterwards.",KeviRun,2025-05-07T02:07:05,1
If there was ever a war that outsiders should not involve involve themselves in any way this is it.,IAmJohnny5ive,2025-05-07T02:44:55,1
"This whole thing snuck up on me because I've been focused on the r/ politics subreddit instead of global news. Trump sucks all the attention in the world and barely talks about global events other than calling for Ukraine's surrender, planning a Palestinian Vegas strip, announcing new batshit tariffs, or threatening to annex our former allies. India, Pakistan, what are those?  I wish we had a real president to answer this disaster.",BaronGrackle,2025-05-07T03:51:00,1

Go at it guys! Watch out for poop on the ground!,30mil,2025-05-07T05:26:24,1
"I don't think Trump can help, the US influence in that area is just not that strong to begin with. China would be the one that determine how this fight goes. If China wants it to escalate, Pakistan will get the support and strike back India more. If not, China can put pressure on the Indian border and India would need to pull back.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-07T07:23:56,1
"Trump recently said that India and Pakistan have been fighting for over a 1000 years (Pakistan didn't even exist till 1947)  So, no. I don't think Trump can do anything in this case.",vpsj,2025-05-07T14:27:32,1
