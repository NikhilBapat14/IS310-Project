"If she's the presidential Democrat nominee we will lose again.   Kamala had one thing bad going for her.  She was a woman and this country isn't ready to elect a woman.  AOC has two things bad going for her.  She's a woman and she's as extreme as Bernie Sanders.  Republicans HATE her because she calls them out on everything and sadly, Republicans go out to vote while democrats sit at home being lazy.  With all the new voting laws the Republicans are trying to pass, it will be that much harder for a poor inner city minority to vote in 2028.    I mean I'd vote for her but she just won't win.  Dems need to concentrate on someone with a legit chance to win.  Tim Walz comes to mind as a good legit contender if he keeps up with appearances the next three years.",Bodycount9,2025-04-25T09:37:26,10
"From where we stand in Europe, it doesn’t look like someone like AOC could win a US presidential race. Most of us said the same about Harris, and we were right.

But like others have said, we are not ready for a women a president.

"It’s crazy how self-assured everyone is, we have no clue what the electorate will look like by 2028 and what will be motivating undecideds to vote at that point.   Basing every argument on Clinton’s and Harris’ failures is so short sighted because there were so many other factors that led to their losses, not just that they were women.  Things are always going to seem too far to reach for until they actually happen. Women were allowed to vote in the US 40+ years before POCs could, but we had a black president before a woman was even a major party nominee. Progress isn’t linear and predictable so please be open to all possibilities while still being critical.",dobtjs,2025-04-25T12:16:53,2

"I firmly believe that thing that will most help us right this ship as a country is a counter to MAGA - a far left leaning progressive.   So from that perspective I’d vote for AOC in a heartbeat, but I also think that we will forever be better off with a more moderate candidate in office.   All that said, if we’re going deep to the right or left on the political spectrum, I’d prefer the left every time. Especially now that the far right has shown their hand and it’s fucked.",JohnnyWeapon,2025-04-25T12:49:28,2

"I wish that someone with the charge and gall of AOC would win. But AOC isn't going to rally the votes, because we must first face that our nation is founded on systemic misogynistic and racist tendencies. The white men emboldened by Trump aren't just going to vote for a Woman, nonetheless a BIPOC Woman. They'll stay home or vote Republican. If there is even a vote. There is a sliver of a chance that republicans stay home. But 2016, 2020, and 2024 have all proved they won't. Maybe in the next 3 years she can change that, but I've talked to enough of these non-voters and they all think that AOC is crazy and/or dumb. And it's never with good reason.",VintageSin,2025-04-25T13:40:39,2
"If she is the nominee, Democrats will lose again. I love AOC but middle of America has shown that they will not vote for a woman as president. The Democratic Party grossly underestimates how much the Bible Belt truly hates women.",AmbitiousYam2557,2025-04-25T13:56:37,2

"Ultimately, the issue comes down to legitimacy. If AOC can win the primary, then there is no reason she should not be the candidate. Both Harris and Clinton had baggage from previous roles and relationships that did not help them, coupled with a questionable campaign strategy. AOC, on the other hand, has both reined in the most volatile aspects of herself we saw in the early days and has built a strong following at the grassroots level. Her ability to define herself before someone can tar and feather her as any 'them' (communist/socialist/crazy/etc) group will determine whether she will be successful. She is building up her key ideas as common sense, and if that can stick, then it deprives the opposition of oxygen, and the opposition has to find another attack path.",LeonardoW9,2025-04-25T17:04:57,2

"As much as I love her, she's not a good candidate for a presidential election, assuming we even have one in 2028.   1. She doesn't pander hard enough to the Midwest, especially straight white males from there. The reason I have this as my number one is because that's the demographic that wins or loses you the presidency. Someone, especially leaning farther left, from the Northeast or West Coast is a poor choice to pander to that audience.   2. She's a woman who isn't white. Unfortunately as much as this shouldn't be a disqualifier, you have to consider the fact that a lot of would-be Dem voters wouldn't go for a woman, let alone a non-white woman.   I adore her to death, but she's not winning under the Electoral College. I'd put Walz up for the nomination, maybe have AOC as her VP.   Course this also all hinges on a 2028 US election even taking place.

I know many people are afraid that too many voters will stray away from her because she's a woman based on the failures of Clinton and Harris, but you got to remember that Clinton won the popular vote and Harris' failure was more because of the fact that most people saw Biden as a terrible president and she campaigned on mostly continuing on his approach. There are people who will stray away from AOC just because she's a woman, yes, but I don't think it's that much of a dealbreaker for so many people as I've seen a lot assume.

"Misogyny will definitely be an issue for her, but misogyny isn't the real reason Hillary or Kamala lost. They lost because they didn't energize the Democratic base, which has been desperate for a more progressive candidate for years now. Biden only won in 2020 because Trump's first term was absolutely horrific and even with that he barely eeked it out.  People were worried about how Obama being black would affect his campaign due to racism, but he ran on progressive ideas like single payer healthcare (which he eventually flipped on) and won in a landslide because those big ideas got voters excited and generated a large turnout. On the other hand, running on a continuation of the trickle-down economic status quo that people keep telling you isn't working for them is a good way to make potential Democratic voters feel disenfranchised and stay at home on election day.",laubs63,2025-04-26T03:13:32,1

Maybe like 50% of the country is scared of a woman president but I don't believe that for a second.

"Don’t make the mistake of blaming Kamala and Hillary’s loss on being women, I’m sure it didn’t help but it was not even close to the main reason. Hillary not only had a massive scandal near the election but is also permanently tied to bill clinton who is extremely unpopular. Not to mention that Hillary is also just generally uncharismatic with horribly cringe attempts at reaching out to the youth vote.  Kamala had several problems aswell, primarily in her relation to Joe Biden another severely unpopular president and the fact she was the incumbent VP during an economic crisis. Her messaging and outreach was just bad, she had little to no proper social media outreach and the attempts she did have were just kinda cringe.  AOC is vastly different, she holds much stronger views compared to the rest of the Democratic Party which helps fight voter apathy (the arguably 1# issue for the Democratic Party) she’s relatively young which is a huge advantage given how ancient Joe Biden and Trump are.

">But is America ready?  When has our nation *ever* been ready to move forward?  Time and again, throughout our history, we've been told that we're not ready, that it's too soon, that we must wait, until the restraints that kept us locked in place became too tight and we broke free and surged ahead.  Was American ready to end slavery?  No, but we did it.  Was America ready to handle the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, WWI, WWII?  No, but we did it.  Was America ready to end segregation, to give women the freedom to vote?  No, but we did it.  Was American ready to send men to the moon?  No, but ***we did it***.  What we're experiencing today, this very moment, is the result of men in positions of power telling us that we're not ready.  Treating us like children, making decisions for us, telling us that they're doing what's best for us, and here we are, yet again, straining against the restraints, struggling violently to move forward and being yanked backward ever more ferociously.  Are we ready?  Perhaps the better question is, what have we left to lose?  They're taking away our freedom to speak, to think, to live.  They don't want us to be ready.  They tell us we aren't ready.  They *need us to believe we are not ready*.  And as long as they control us that way, we will never be ready.  We are ready.  We have *always* been ready.

Never convince yourself that a woman or a POC can’t achieve what a cis white dude can. When you convince yourself of this, you are speaking in the tongue of the oppressor.

Biden won in 2020 despite not being a meme only because America was in such bad shape from Trumps handling of the pandemic so that was a fluke. Kamala was an amazing candidate on paper but just didn’t have a strong meme to carry her. “We are not going back” seemed pretty good but voters have the collective memory of a goldfish and the slogan would require people to remember things.   AOC would be a fantastic president and she has gained a lot of credibility and experience over these last few years.

Honestly AOC would actually have a better shot at turning conservatives based on the weird crossover voters she had in her home district that voted for her AND trump.  they liked how ""anti-establishment"" she was and how they felt she spoke their language and actually talked to them and not at them.  Sure, sexism and racism are real legitimate things, but there aren't that many left of center that would allow those things to enable another disastrous MAGA candidate.

Hilary lost because she was incredibly unlike and tied to Clinton's presidency. Kamala lost because Biden tried to run again and gave her no time to sell herself or make her own policy to differentiate herself from Biden. AOC would lose for lack of experience.

"Chatgpt o3 view on run by AOC:  1. How the 2028 electorate will look  *Projection: linear continuation of 2020-23 growth; does not include recession or migration shocks.   ---  2. Where implicit bias is still strongest  Large-scale Project Implicit data (≈ 4.6 million Race-IAT tests) aggregated by researchers shows:  Higher pro-White / anti-Black implicit bias scores in the Deep South and parts of the Plains; lower scores in the Southwest and Pacific states.   Bias declines as population diversity rises; metro areas with ≥ 40 % non-White residents average ~0.10 lower IAT D-scores than homogeneous areas.   Anti-Latino bias is less systematically mapped, but field-experiment meta-analysis shows hiring discrimination against Latinos persists at ~1990s levels nationwide.    Bottom line: the states AOC must flip (AZ, NV, GA, NC, WI, PA, MI) have lower implicit-bias scores than the national median except NC; racial resentment remains highest in the GOP’s safest states, not its pivotal ones.   ---  3. AOC’s current baseline  The same survey noted that she is “no better-known now than six years ago”—roughly one quarter of adults still say “no opinion.”   Interpretation:  Within Democrats she is popular (> 65 % fav.), but Independents are –19 pp and Republicans –80 pp.  Net-negative is much smaller than Harris (–11 pp) or Pelosi (–23 pp) were at similar horizons in 2020, but larger than Sanders at the same point in 2015.    ---  4. Structural pluses and minuses for a 2028 AOC run   ---  5. Electoral-college math (simple scenario)  1. Democratic core (CA + Northeast + IL/WA/OR/CO/NM/VA + HI) = ~225 EV.   2. Likeliest pick-ups:  AZ (11 EV) – 35 % Latino electorate, Phoenix metro very low implicit bias score; D + 1 in 2024.  NV (6 EV) – 32 % Latino; Culinary-union machine.  GA (16 EV) – 33 % Black electorate; AOC needs Obama-level Black youth turnout.    3. Upper-Midwest path: MI + WI + PA still lean D but require Midwestern moderates who are wary of “socialism”; bias less salient than ideology.    If AOC holds the 2024 Harris states (222 EV) and wins AZ + NV + GA, she reaches 255 EV, still five short—one of MI/WI/PA is mandatory.   ---  6. Does intrinsic racism sink her chances?  Swing-state bias environment: The pivotal states have below-average implicit race-bias scores and large minority electorates; bias is a headwind but not an electoral veto.  Cross-pressures: Ideology appears to loom larger than ethnicity. Harris (Black/South-Asian) lost 2024 despite winning non-White voters 75-24; the margin hinged on white working-class defections, not explicit racism.  Trend line: National implicit bias toward Black Americans fell sharply after 2020 protests, then drifted upward but remains ~0.05 IAT-D lower than pre-Floyd baseline . Younger cohorts show near-zero bias. By 2028 the electorate will be ~4 pp more Gen-Z/Millennial than in 2024.   Conclusion: Intrinsic racism and sexism would impose a real, measurable drag—especially in NC, parts of the Midwest, and among non-college white men—but the data do not indicate an insurmountable ceiling. AOC’s bigger vulnerabilities are (1) ideological branding (“democratic socialist”) and (2) her current net-negative name recognition. If she can:  cut her unfavorable-rating gap by ~10 pp,  drive youth turnout back toward 2020’s 50 %+ in battlegrounds, and  match Obama-level Latino support (65-35) while holding Black support,   then a 270+ path—AZ + NV + GA + MI—is plausible.  Fail on any two of those, and the Electoral College math reverts to a narrow loss even without accounting for residual bias.   ---  What to watch between now and primary season  1. Whether Latino men stay R-leaning after the Trump era or snap back toward Democrats.   2. Project Implicit’s annual bias map—if anti-Latino bias spikes in swing states, that is a warning sign.   3. AOC’s favorability trajectory once she campaigns outside deep-blue districts; early-state and suburban polling will show if ideology or identity is the bigger hurdle.",ShadoWolf,2025-04-25T11:36:05,0

"I think it absolutely fueled our loss on several levels. We've had a serious branding problem within the party for almost the whole 21st century: everyone hates our candidates. We keep running hyper-establishment Washington insider bureaucrats (usually coastal, often former lawyers). These people are deeply unpopular, even when they're good. Gore, Kerry, Hillary, Biden 2024, and Harris all fit that archetype to a tee--they're all also extremely old by candidate norms (Gore at 52 was on the older end back in 2000) and that doesn't help with the out-of-touch bureaucrat image when people have been screaming for economic change candidates for decades. Remember, Bush beat Gore on anti-elitism rhetoric and we responded by running two ultrarich East Coast lawyers turned congressmen.  Even back in 2008, there was a lot of dissatisfied talk about the party throwing its weight behind the wrong kind of candidate (Hillary). The party then threw its weight behind her *again* in 2016. 2020 did nothing to repair the brand damage--Biden was only an acceptable candidate because nobody wanted the Trump administration at the helm during Covid, and people had serious age concerns even for one term. Remember, it was widely agreed 77 was too old with Reagan and this is something every young Dem I know grew up acknowledging as a universal truth that was used to bash the other side over.  So Biden straight-up refused the wide will of the electorate and insisted on running again no matter how much people screamed no. Turns out there was a massive age-related coverup to deceive the electorate and Biden was not all there, as we all saw at the debate. He *barely* backed out in time to get his backup...another coastal lawyer turned Washington insider that voters decisively rejected during the 2020 primaries. Biden picked her after announcing he'd choose a female VP and strongly implying she'd be black--this is where Biden introduced the ""DEI VP"" narrative and then went on to pick the lowest performer on the test, btw. I hate that narrative, but it originated from our side's awful messaging.  So in 2024, after decades extreme dissatisfaction with our candidates that has triggered massive brand damage, we attempt to deceive voters about the stability of our main candidate and it backfires horribly. Leaving us time to get a deeply unpopular VP that not only did nobody vote for, but the electorate voted *against* her the only time she tried to step on the national stage. And she's the exact same sort of old coastal lawyer bureaucrat people have hated since all the old days, this time with a less flattering narrative and 0 voter agency.  Our mission for the 2020s was to repair our desperately frayed image. And instead we did this shit. The same sort of thing people have been complaining bitterly about for decades, but significantly worse with an actual coverup and zero voter input. How can it not have contributed?!?

"It was definitely a factor.  We all know that incumbent presidents usually don't face serious primary challengers... but because of that, Biden's lack of fitness for the job was hidden from the American people until it was way too late.    Harris never had to fight her way through a real primary, either.  She dropped out of the race early in 2020 after a disappointing performance, so she never had a chance to develop messaging that actually resonated with voters.  I don't think she was a horrible candidate, but she didn't have campaign experience so she ran the kind of campaign that would have worked great 20 years ago.  Democratic voters have been distrustful of the primary process for as long as I've been a voting adult.  There's a feeling that the DNC puts its thumb on the scale, that the media can make or break candidates, that shady backroom deals determine who drops out and when, that later-voting states are denied a meaningful choice, and that there's too much focus on Iowa.  All the talk of a totally undemocratic mini-primary after Biden dropped out was truly concerning, too.  So even when there is a primary, it's hard to convince people that everything was fair and above board.  TBH, I think primaries are a big part of why we have Trump.  It's a long, undemocratic process that favors the media's chosen candidate.",shinkouhyou,2025-04-25T13:33:35,0

"Obama was a man, and a very charismatic one at that. He succeeded not because views toward African Americans changed, but in spite of the existing racism. Just because Obama was elected doesn’t mean that America cured racism, sexism, and homophobia. And even then, being a woman is viewed very differently than being a black man in the eyes of much of America.    But the fundamental fact is that the Democratic Party, despite what is said on Reddit, is not a monolith. There are a ton of factions that express sometimes wildly different views. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get those factions in line behind one candidate- and even more difficult to get them to actually show up to vote.   Women are more popular among younger liberals but one of the most true facts of politics is that young liberals don’t vote. Democrats can’t shape policy to win over people who don’t show up to the polls.   For Dems to win the presidential election, they need support *and* high turnout from 3 of the five demos  * old, predominantly northeastern lifetime Democrats (this was the group that showed up big for Biden)   * blacks   * Arab-Americans   * 60% of union voters  * 50% of Latinos  Harris won four of those demos, but turnout from almost all of them was low. You have to bring out the vote for these individuals. And they usually don’t agree.   The problem for a woman candidate is that there are sizable populations within each of these groups that simply won’t put a woman in a position of power. Democrats need these groups to win- there’s no other way around it. Fielding a female candidate already puts Dems on the back foot.",CFBCoachGuy,2025-04-25T13:00:25,1
"In the US, Black men got the right to vote 50 years before women did. I don't think it's impossible for a woman to win, but I'm also not going to pretend they don't face unique challenges.   Because every president has been a man, we tend to associate the job with certain traits associated with men. Remember, shortly after the last election people were genuinely claiming that bullshitting for a few hours on Joe Rogan's podcast — the most stereotypical male thing imaginable — was the key to winning the presidency.",00Oo0o0OooO0,2025-04-25T12:27:41,1

"This is the right take. We need strong leaders in Congress just as much as we need them in the White House, and AOC has a proven track record representing the people who voted her into Congress, in addition to what she's doing on a national scale.

I would argue if it was Biden vs Trump in 2024, the election wouldn't have changed in the slightest. They both had headwinds from inflation (the same that sank reelection bids for something like, 75% of incumbents in 2022-2024), depressed base turnout because of Gaza (which was IMO Israel ratfucking the election for Trump), and a general lack of enthusiasm. Sure, there was some when Walz started calling the Republicans weird, but executive meddling put a stop to that really quick (my guess someone pulled Hillary's 'Basket of Deplorables' comment about Trump supporters out of the archives)   And what ultimately sank them both was trying to appease the right-leaning centrist voter instead of drumming up turnout for the far-left progressives.

But 81 million people voted against him. I say voted against him, not voted for Biden, because most of those 81 million people would have voted for a ham sandwich if it meant no more Trump.  Then the post-pandemic inflation hit and the media conveniently blamed Biden's economic policies. Couple that with the disastrous debate performance and no one had any excitement for Biden. So with way too little time he says Kamala is the candidate despite her not winning a primary.  So people paying higher prices are disillusioned with the government. They don't remember or care about Trump, so fewer people were nail bitingly voting against him. The 71 million 'useful idiots' that voted for him in 2020 still voted for him. Tack on another few million that believed he would fix inflation and you get the 2024 election.  He didn't cheat. Every swing state went Trump. The least we can do is be better than the conservatives and admit it. Trump won because people are naive and gullible along with us making a bad choice in 2020.

"> In fact, I’d say that describes most “centrist” voters that Democratic candidates regularly fail to court. These people want to vote blue but they generally are put off by more progressive rhetoric.  First of all there’s a big difference between being a person of color and having progressive rhetoric.   Second I don’t agree. Most voters Dems fail to court just don’t know what Dems stand for. They can’t name signature policy proposals, party leaders, political stunts, or notable movements that don’t come from right wing media. They maybe assume Dems believe in more regulations and taxes.   People don’t know anything but what Fox News and other right wing media says because Dems fail to put together a strong counter narrative. That includes “progressive rhetoric” in general, most of which is logical even if it implies big changes. But if Fox News tries smearing it, and Dems panic and distance themselves, then there’s no one defending those ideas. Fox will keep tagging Dems as radical progressives, and Dems abandon progressivism rather than focus on the bad faith right wing attacks. The end result is that they both have stigma for being “too liberal/progressive” and have a weaker coalition at the same time. It works great for the right.  If Harris stays silent while Trump spends $200m accusing her of prioritizing undocumented trans prisoners over relief for Americans suffering from inflation, then of course trans rights isn’t going to poll well. People will think social progressivism has to be a trade off with economic growth or that Dems can’t focus on doing both.  Diversity and equality is good for the economy, and Dems need to be able to argue that well.

">Then how are Republicans winning then?  You contradict yourself with your lack of logic.  The republicans never try to reach across the aisle, and the republicans do not give a sh*t about reaching any moderate voters.  The republicans focus on what they want, whilst the dem leadership who are corporatists try to reach the ones who have the same views on the economy as the republicans but do not wat to kill all the gays.  On every issue, the American public agree with progressives between 70-80%.  However the dem leadership are all corporatists wh*res who want nothing more than fall down on their hands and knees and bow down to the republicans whilst simultaneously fight with unyielding strength against anyone who is even the slightest progressive on economic issues.  Stop trying to reach across the aisle to reach the mythical moderate voter, they have all since all long gone if they ever existed.  Turnout matters, the republicans gets their base to the ballot boxes by giving them what they want, but the dems try to shame their base to vote for the corporatist candidate because it is the ""lesser evil"".  Give the dem base what they want, such as Medicare for all, affordable housing, strong worker protections, similar rules like the other OECD nations have.",Turioturen,2025-04-25T18:47:33,13

The electoral college is not getting eliminated.  To make an amendment for a change like that you need 2/3 of congress and 3/4 of states to approve.    The democrats need to go back and fight for votes from rural voters like they used to have and have candidates from rural areas.     The most realistic changes that I think could happen off the top of my head would be:   1. Rebalance the electoral college votes to address population disparity and this may or may not be a win for democrats but it should happen.   The electoral college has not changed in a very long time. This is from 2018 and I don't know the 2025 #s: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/05/31/u-s-population-keeps-growing-but-house-of-representatives-is-same-size-as-in-taft-era/  2. Add states.  Add whatever.  Split up California and fight for more senators.  3.  Get some real voting fairness laws in place to enforce getting rid of gerrymandered districts in states. That is going to change district representation.   The democrat's strategy also has sucked.   I can think a lot that the DNC should be doing this is missing.,BadDecisionPolice,2025-04-26T20:33:20,1

"If you really don’t want to use common sense with anything I’ve listed thus far, I’m done here after this post.  I’m listing Gavin Newsom off the top of my head, but literally replace him with any other muppet in the Democratic Party that people are eyeing to become president that isn’t a progressive and the statement still holds.  Also, no, I’m not pulling the race card. I’m pulling the “You are advocating for the suppression of minority voices because you’re afraid of racists” card. I don’t give a shit if some black people think the same thing you’re saying. They’re dumb ass idiots as well for thinking the same thing. Not every single race thinks like one monolith.
