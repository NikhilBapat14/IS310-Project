"I find this ""reclassification"" to be odd or even completely fabricated, since in 2017 the executive assistant director of the FBI Jill Sanborn testified *""It’s fair to say the shooter was motivated by a desire to commit an attack on members of Congress and then knowing by doing so he would likely be killed in the process, ... This conduct is something that we would today characterize as a domestic terrorism event.”* Stanborn later stated that the shooter, James Hodgkinson, appeared to be motivated by a “blend” of factors, but ultimately “intended for the shooting to be his final act on Earth.” Hodgkinson died shortly after the shooting, after a firefight with police ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/29/fbi-suicide-by-cop-2017-baseball-shooting-485002)).  In other words his motive was clearly to attack members of the Republican party, but his death was a result of suicide by cop.  If this ""reclassification"" is true, then it is just political theatre trying to perpetuate GOP victimhood some 8 years after the fact. It becomes even more incredible when you consider that its praise comes from a fellow participant of Jan 6.",space_coder,2025-05-06T16:23:58,9

"It's about trying to frame the left as violent.  Most shooters seems to be right wing, so having 1 that was shooting at Republicans gives them a what about? to use.",benderrodz,2025-05-06T17:44:01,4

"Because the FBI did a deep investigation of the shooting and the shooter's motives and their trained psychologists determined that the most likely motive behind the shooting was to be killed by cops for attacking the Congressmen at that ball field that day. The ""terrorism"" angle is questionable because acts of terrorism generally are committed in order to pursue a larger political goal, but near as I can tell the only goal the shooter had was to be killed by cops.",noncongruent,2025-05-06T17:35:19,0
"That guy, with his views, traveling to across the country and spontaneously choosing to attack those particular people at that place and time, indicates motive more than him wanting to get killed by police.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-05-06T18:21:00,0
I trust the pre-Patel FBI over anyone else. Current Republicans just want to be professional victims.,noncongruent,2025-05-06T18:22:46,0
