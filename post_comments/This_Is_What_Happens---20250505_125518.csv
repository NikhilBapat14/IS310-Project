"> This Is What Happens When Local News Outlets Disappear  > This article is only available to subscribers. Login here to subscribe.  I doubt it was intentional, but point taken.  Since about 2018, I've marveled at the fact that all kinds of MAGA talking-points are readily available and widely broadcasted, yet NYT, WaPo, The Atlantic, and the rest squirrel away all of their content behind hard or soft paywalls. It led me to adopt this saying:  > Journalism is expensive, but propaganda is free.",reckless_commenter,2025-05-05T13:03:02,23

The time to speak out on that was ‘96…29 years too late.,SamuelYosemite,2025-05-06T02:52:50,1
Not to mention those sources are shit to begin with and spend significant resources to sane wash tRump and Republicans.  The media sold out for a buck decades ago.  I can't really feel bad when the fascists come for them.,Richfor3,2025-05-05T13:07:47,5
"They didn’t sell out? They got priced out ? Like. Journalism just wasn’t ready for the internet, social media, and YouTube. Like some YouTubers just read news article and regurgitate it. But you can’t really be mad at them. The publisher themselves is fine with not trying to compete. It’s just a case of new technology disrupting old paradigms ",Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T13:12:00,5
"How do you make money when all of its on line? Advertising and generating click traffic, it’s a terrible model and very easily manipulated by bad players.",Silly-Scene6524,2025-05-05T17:57:28,1
"They didn't have to gravitate toward the pop-culture intellectual laziness of the blogosphere. No, they chose to do that.  They could have rallied around their distinctive and increasingly important role of objectively gathering facts and serving as a public record of evidence and conversations. They could have doubled down on the kind of ferociously informed observations about law and politics that Rachel Maddow and the Strict Scrutiny gang exhibit. They could have planted their feet in the ground and made the case for the critical urgency of journalism in the age of MAGA.  Instead, they chose to cater to the lowest common denominator - voters who are uninterested, low-attention, and oblivious to the rightward pull of public discourse by billionaires. They chose anodyne ""both sides"" stories that minimally placate everyone and inform no one. They chose milquetoast sound-bite headlines over insightful commentary.  They made all these choices in pursuit of the path of least resistance, no risks, and preserving a broad subscriber base and predictable revenue. And in doing so, they lost their historic identities and became part of the beige, narcoleptic, empty rhetoric that enabled gaudy, nihilistic idiots to seize the spotlight because at least *those people* had something to say.  It's notable that NYT's most well-known feature over the past decade is Wordle.",reckless_commenter,2025-05-05T14:46:01,3
"So like I said, money was more important than integrity and an informed public.  At any point these writers and media members who have made millions could have made other choices but few did.    Good for them.  They made their money, just don’t come crying to me when the consequences come.",Richfor3,2025-05-05T20:41:35,1
