"Everyone who voted for this senile old fuck must never be forgiven for their sin. I’m sure nothing will come it, but even the fact that he’s posting about this insanity should be grounds for removal into a nursing home.

And he has a mate that will refurbish it ….  At a price.  And another that will supply transport to and from the main land and another that can supply the guards and another than will supply the canteen and another that will supply some specialized uniforms for the inmates.

"I can't remember where I read it originally, but there was an *excellent* article in the 2017-2018 timeframe that traced back what was on TV during his childhood and specifically had references to '50s Westerns that would've informed his worldview.

"I posed the question to ChatGPT on what it would take in cost and time to revamp the entire building. I have personally taken a tour of Alcatraz and I can tell you that it's been severely deteriorated due to the brackish water surrounding it.  That doesn't include the cost for renovating the guards housing, the electrical system, destalinization plant that would have to be built and so much more.  Everything would need to be sent by in or airlifted by helicopter. It's completely surrounded by water.  The original housing for guards also included accommodations for their family.",TwistedMemories,2025-05-04T22:59:47,0
