Not buying cheap disposable products from the top polluting county in the world is one of the most environmentally friendly things that can be done. This is what I voted for.,Adras7us_,2025-05-09T20:08:58,7

"Its already hitting in various ways. I do ad sales on the internet using the super-massive social media systems. Lots of ads, but it tells you exactly where the economy is. The people I work with are middle class American buyers for items that are $500-1500.   At least as far as that market goes, this is the worst month for rates in the past 3 years. Jan/Feb were better than expected, but in April, it started taking a pretty notable downturn. It will be interesting where things will be in 3-4 months when the parts that the things I market towards have their prices increase since a fair bit of the ""Made in America"" stuff still uses Chinese/overseas components. That is where I expect things to potentially get worse. We will see though.",mrstickball,2025-05-09T13:09:04,293
"Dockworkers being laid off, truck drivers not getting contracts, stores having fewer products to sell, and higher prices, especially for clothing and shoes.  Should be prevalent in the next month or so.  Assuming things aren't resolved soon, also expect significant big government bailouts similar to the ones the President ordered the last time he decided to set tariffs on China.",cathbadh,2025-05-09T19:21:27,91
It should free up the postal service and give our landfills a break from cheap temu plastic junk. But I agree there will obviusly be an impact on the economy as consumers change their buying habits.¬†,inflamito,2025-05-09T13:42:18,46

"I am not renewing my prime membership. My husband and I have been putting things in our cart and not checking out for the last month. We had over a $1000 in items and they have been in the cart for a month which means we don‚Äôt really need these things, we just want them.¬†  We finally went through the cart and eliminated all the frivolous, probably cheaply made things and only purchased a few necessities that we know we need. Total waste of $150 dollars.  Having Amazon at your fingertips of your phone and using ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù feature really makes it so easy to spend so much and not even realize it.¬†",Blahblahnownow,2025-05-09T15:16:55,26

The issue is you could have hit those targets without the tariffs. Hitting diminis shipping could have done it and killed Shein/Temu/ect while keeping the stuff that feeds US businesses easily enough.,mrstickball,2025-05-09T15:38:56,118
Go check that fast fashion Shein stuff on YouTube. Really sad conditions borderline slavery over there. And people are going nuts because their clothing options are dwindling. lol,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-09T17:47:38,17
I have a set limit every month that I choose to spend on myself and my vanity. I don't buy stuff randomly from Amazon just because. But it has its advantages. There are so many items you can get for cheap on Amazon. The subscribe and save along with the 6% or 5% cash back quickly adds up.,Outrageous_Skirt9963,2025-05-10T00:19:08,0
"Serious question: Where are you getting American made clothes?  I buy some stuff from Duluth Trading Co, but most of their stuff is made in Indonesia, Vietnam, France, etc. Carhartt‚Äôs shops are mostly in Mexico. I can safely assure you Walmart, Kohl‚Äôs, etc aren‚Äôt making their clothes in the US.",CamoAnimal,2025-05-09T16:08:46,129
Yeah I am not going to pay more if I can get something better at a lower price just for the made in tag. You can't guilt me into paying $50 for something when I can get the same or better for $5.,Outrageous_Skirt9963,2025-05-10T00:15:43,17
"You'd be surprised. All I know is bid rates for ads for Americans are down significantly meaning companies aren't spending the money they were 5 months ago, and my ad price/spend for all other countries is unchanged or even up by comparison.",mrstickball,2025-05-09T16:59:25,99

"You really have to look at quality first. I know it‚Äôs more difficult for something like clothing, but don‚Äôt assume that just because something is made in the US it‚Äôs better. I buy a lot of electrical products and skip over a lot of US made stuff in favor of usually German parts because the machining and fit tolerances are often so much better, despite doing my best to buy American.  We have some catching up to do in certain areas unfortunately, even if trade policy manages to bring more production back to the US (and I have my doubts based on the current outlook).",zip117,2025-05-10T00:37:58,10
That may very well be. Another theory is that online advertising is a giant money laundering scam and the time of free money being sloshed around with no oversight is coming to an end for washinton and their buddies.  I much prefer this version since I'd rather not believe that people actually click on internet ads intentionally let alone buy the product. But it's probably less likely to be true.,day25,2025-05-09T17:44:46,-114
"I appreciate the link, but it‚Äôs kinda side stepping my question. I can Google companies that make clothes in the US. What I‚Äôm more interested in is which of them you‚Äôve bought from?",CamoAnimal,2025-05-09T16:26:35,49
Like what? I'm also an electrician so I'm curious as to what specific parts you think Germany makes better? I like my Knipex tools as much as the next guy but they're maybe 5% nicer than Klein.,blandunoffensivename,2025-05-10T11:14:20,3
"You can believe whatever you want. I have all the receipts and data showing the money the corporation's are paying and now what they aren't for some reason today vs. 4 months ago.

" I personally shop from Deluth TC a lot because it's often discounted on GovX, and I get a lot of underwear/socks/basics from them. I like American Giant for more casual clothes but it's expensive and shipping times can lag with demand. Freenote Cloth and 7Titans are both kinda upper scale options I like. Origin USA makes great outdoor / athleisure wear. I do tend to get more expensive pieces that will last so if you're looking for more budget-friendly USA made stuff I'm probably the wrong guy. I also pretty much only wear True Classics Tshirts these days. Very comfortable. I don't have an American made suit so if anyone has a lead on a good one I'd like to hear it.",blandunoffensivename,2025-05-09T17:04:51,7
"Not tools, mostly fittings. The LFMC and LFNC fittings from T&B and ABB Adaptaflex, mostly made in the UK, are far and away better than that Hubbell/RACO junk we we get here in the US. They fit better and seal better, and have real neoprene gaskets instead of a piece of yellow nylon. ANAMET out of Illinois is an exception but they are harder to find at distributors.  NEMA enclosures are another example. Compare the paint quality on a RITTAL to a brand new NEMA 3R or NEMA 4 Hoffman and you‚Äôll immediately see the difference. I‚Äôve got a brand new Hoffman out of the shrink wrap and I can see the paint is already flaking off in a couple places near the lid edges. Now I realize we do a lot of things for cost when it doesn‚Äôt matter much otherwise, but when paint flakes off and the shitty galvanized coating wears down you get nucleation spots for corrosion. Note that everyone else in the world uses nickel-plated brass fittings, but zinc-plated steel is basically all we use here unless we import them from another country for a critical application. Stainless steel is the exception but that‚Äôs mainly for food processing since it‚Äôs incredibly expensive and susceptible to galling.",zip117,2025-05-10T12:21:50,2
I didn't disagree at all with your data only your conclusion from it. I am not sure what about basic logic is so hard for people these days.,day25,2025-05-09T22:22:16,-55
"Interesting. I guess I never really cared about paint chipping on a box, but I can see where you're coming from if you're doing high-end installations or commercial applications. I work for the government so all our stuff is mandated to be US manufactured - or at least not Chinese - in most circumstances so I don't have a lot of experience with German fittings. What do you do, commercial or residential?",blandunoffensivename,2025-05-10T12:45:10,3
"I‚Äôm not an electrician but I‚Äôm a failure analysis engineer. So when there‚Äôs a gas line explosion or something I work to reconstruct what happened with micro CT scans and metallurgical analysis, things like that. Yes it‚Äôs mostly high-end industrial installations and for most people paint quality doesn‚Äôt functionally matter, but when it does we just don‚Äôt have the manufacturing expertise in the US that we used to. Look at any control cabinet for an important process and you‚Äôll see a lot of German and UK made stuff.",zip117,2025-05-10T12:58:55,2
