">In late April, she was recorded by a woman posing as a nanny, who was actually wearing a hidden camera for O'Keefe Media Group,   Well, this is something.

I guarantee everything she leaked is what MAGA wants you to believe.  Everything is a story to justify hiding Trump’s involvement.,jxr02,2025-05-09T21:46:00,3

"In the video, she claims that the FBI has “tens of thousands” of videos of the Epstein investigation that involve minors. This is a claim she has made to the press as well. Saying this serves a couple purposes. It is important to first note that she is not saying this in any official settings where she would be under oath, like in a congressional hearing or investigation or a courtroom. She is not saying it in any setting where another branch of the government could then demand the evidence.   This story of hers blames Biden (“He didn’t act on these tens of thousands of videos of CSAM? He’s the protector of pedophiles”).   This story is believable enough to their core audience (anyone choosing to seek out videos from anything associated with James O’Keefe is already a true believer).  This story is incredibly nonspecific in its timeframe (Tens of thousands of videos is a lot to review. They notably aren’t giving an estimation of the collected time length, information they certainly can compile much more quickly.).  She has to share this version of her story only in specific situations where she doesn’t receive pushback or legal ramifications. It allows for their supposed investigation to go on forever, if needed. If I were a bolder man, a betting man, I would stake some money on their investigation lasting forever.",SecretGayFacebook,2025-05-09T20:39:38,16
