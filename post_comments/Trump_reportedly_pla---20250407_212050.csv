What dictator level bullshit is this? Trump is such a fucking joke.¬†,PoopTransplant,2025-04-07T21:25:14,1
Can't wait for the mandatory portrait of Donald Trump being the only thing that can be on one clean wall of every room of the house law to go into effect. Bonus points if it has to hang higher than any other object in the room.,cmiller4642,2025-04-07T21:28:49,1

"I wonder if he has any idea how much hatred he is stirring up towards himself, by these choices. I didn't think I could feel this depth of sheer hatred for any politician - and I DESPISED George Bush Jr - but this is like the 70th circle of hell, if you get the Dante reference.",LocalStatistician538,2025-04-07T21:29:00,1

"It would be the greatest protest in American history if millions of people showed up and boxed the parade in, making it unable to move from Arlington. I can‚Äôt even imagine how angry that would make Trump.   Would he order that they assault American citizens? Open fire? I honestly don‚Äôt know. Would it do anything to shock and wake up his base that they are literally supporting a dictator if he did? Again, I don‚Äôt know. I doubt it, for most of them, but I don‚Äôt know.",Yelsiap,2025-04-07T21:41:04,1
