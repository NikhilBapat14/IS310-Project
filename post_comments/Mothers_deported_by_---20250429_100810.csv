"This headline is a very weird way of saying ""US citizens deported""",hey-coffee-eyes,2025-04-29T10:12:40,78
"These are not deportations.  Deportations are a formal procedure with due process.  These are removals, kidnappings, people being disappeared, etc.  The word ""deportations"" normalizes what they're doing.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-29T10:19:19,56
">“Here we had moms held completely in isolation, being told what was happening to their children. They didn’t have an opportunity to talk this through, to weigh the pros and cons of taking or leaving their children in the US.”  It's just... so unbelievably cruel, I mean, it's hard to fathom how anyone could justify this, to be honest, it's sickening that families are being treated this way, especially when it's supposedly about choice, and it really makes you wonder what happened exactly, and if these moms were genuinely able to make informed decisions, or if it was just a show, a facade of sorts, because honestly, being held in isolation and told what's happening to your children... that doesn't sound like a situation where you can possibly weigh the pros and cons freely.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-29T10:33:58,18

The monstrosity is the whole point for the trump admin and their gestapo.,Lord-Velveeta,2025-04-29T10:25:17,7
"I keep wondering, as bad as it is. At least give them the chance to stay here if a father or relative is a citizen. Of course that’s after due process assuming they are deported. Of course why would I expect the Trump admin to be anything less than cruel. Men are parents too ",Current_Animator7546,2025-04-29T10:13:06,6
"Homan was saying he'd deport US Born children with their parents if it came down to that.

"When the US renditions children because of their race, the script is lost. The stage is in ruins. The building has gone up in flames. And lady liberty is on the next boat back to France.",Curious-Telephone293,2025-04-29T11:39:12,7
This is the Trump administration's way of trying to undo birthright citizenship. It's despicable that they're doing this to children because they can get away with it. Children are dependent on their parents or guardians. The administration frames it as the undocumented parent's choice to take the child with them. They're not giving the undocumented parent the option to leave the child with the documented parent or family member. They do not think these children have a right to be in the US even though they were born here and are US citizens. The courts have to see this as a workaround to end birthright citizenship.,BeyGreenEyed,2025-04-29T12:36:20,7
That would have made FAR too much sense.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-29T10:19:37,6
We already know this. We expect them to lie and lie they do. Over and over.,Ornery-Ticket834,2025-04-29T14:19:58,2
They are trafficking American children. Great nation !,Maleficent_Pay_4154,2025-04-29T16:37:44,2
I believe it's a direct response to the claim from the trump admin that the mothers chose to take their children with them.,shibumi7126,2025-04-29T10:13:59,46
Right? It’s like do you trust the known liars and thugs who kidnapped you to get your kids home or do you take them with you so you at least know for sure where they are. ICE and their collaborators are disgusting,Jenjen4040,2025-04-29T13:15:44,7
I wouldn’t trust them if I were in that situation. If I and my kids were kidnapped by those pigs. Those pigs who have conveniently “lost” a bunch of children. I don’t think I could trust them to get my kids across a street safely let alone back home. Better to have them where I can see them.,Jenjen4040,2025-04-29T13:18:13,4
"The thing is for at least one of these kids the father was a US citizen, only the mother was an immigrant. They're apparently saying one parent being a citizen isn't enough.",Trickster289,2025-04-29T12:46:20,5
"Yeah you're right, I just want to make sure the point is hammered home for the people who only read the headlines.",hey-coffee-eyes,2025-04-29T10:19:42,16
"They ""chose"" to take their children with them because they were illegal and everything you do while illegal is also illegal, including having kids.   I'm surprised there haven't been reports of them straight up stealing their valuables and cash, claiming that anything earned while illegal is the property of Trump.   Edit:  i think i need to clarify that i dont believe this statement myself, its an example of how the Trump people think",MissionCreeper,2025-04-29T11:25:29,-2
Um… even if you are here illegally if you have a child in this country they are a natural born citizen,IgnoreMeBot,2025-04-29T13:26:31,11
Yeah of course.  But the Trumpists dont think that,MissionCreeper,2025-04-29T14:08:20,3
"Yes but if it were me being unlawfully deported, I would definitely want my babies with me and not left in another country. I don’t understand why the mom shouldn’t be allowed to take them? You want them separated?",CheaperPotato420,2025-04-29T14:03:29,-3
Fathers have anything at all to say. Was there any discussion between parents or other family members? See the point?,Ornery-Ticket834,2025-04-29T14:21:57,6
Why shouldn't the father be able to keep the child back in the states? You want them separated?,stevecow68,2025-04-29T16:13:14,1
"Like it says, they gave them a minutes to decide. I would’ve taken my baby with me too- moms are different, sorry if you don’t get it.",CheaperPotato420,2025-04-29T14:58:07,-5
That’s your idea of due process? It’s not mine.,Ornery-Ticket834,2025-04-29T19:35:44,2
"I don’t believe any of these people are getting detained and deported legally, all I’m saying is if it were me, yes give me my baby with me. It’s all horrible and very very unconstitutional",CheaperPotato420,2025-04-29T23:56:03,1
