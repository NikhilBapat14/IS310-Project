"While these parties now are run-of-the-mill center-right parties, they all have their roots in European Christian Democracy, which was a movement that aimed to find an alternative to liberalism and socialism based on the teachings of the ""church."" (which Church that was depended on the party and the region).   The first of these parties that used the name ""People"" was the Italian People's Party which took its name from one of its founders Luigi Sturzo who had developed an ideology he called *Popolarismo.* The idea of being the party ""of the people"" was meant to contrast itself with liberals, who were ""the party of individuals,"" and ""socialists,"" who were the ""party of the working class.""  The other parties took their names from their",loselyconscious,2023-01-12T23:50:59,4
"They aren't.  Right-wing parties, especially populist ones, often use words etc that are popular. It's not just with 'people', you also see this with 'democracy', 'national' and 'freedom' too.  They use this words because they poll well among the kind of people that they want to appeal to.",Hapsbum,2023-01-14T11:07:43,3

"In other words, lots of ""People's Parties"" are essentially populist in nature, and ""people"" came to be the name of a collective political voice that's not already taken by other political perspectives.",mormagils,2023-01-13T10:21:46,3

"Uh not really. I'm saying that they come from a specific ideological movement called Christian Democracy (and most of these parties have mostly abandoned that ideology.  Christian Democracy was actually pretty anti-populist in most of its variations.   The use of the term ""people"" here makes the most sense in dialogue with Marxist and socialist parties. In the view of a socialist, a socialist party is a party of the ""working class."" which is only a segment of society (a majority but still only a party. (That's why lots of Marxists actually dislike populism. They think it created an identity as a ""people"" that obscures class politics). In the mind of socialists, liberal parties are all class parties; they are the class party of the bourgeoisie.   Christian Democracy says, ""We are not a party of any class. We are a party of ""the people"" by which we mean everyone (or at least every Christian). So Christian Democracy is ultimately opposing politics based on divisions in society (again, except maybe religious divisions), which is the hallmark of populism.   So, for example, Christian Democrats often supported expanding the social safety net and redistribution of wealth, but they didn't use language about empowering disempowered people or taking back what was stolen as populists would. Instead, they invoke Christian morality and the obligation of the better off to help the lesser of.    I am talking in generalizations here. I don't know enough to say that no Christian Democratic party ever swerved into populism, but this is my understanding of the overall ideology.",loselyconscious,2023-01-14T03:24:34,1
