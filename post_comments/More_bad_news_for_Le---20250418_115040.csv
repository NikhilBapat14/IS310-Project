I hope she gets the max punishment. Her smugness was disgraceful. She is literally the poster it (not sure if it is female) for lawfare. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-18T11:56:15,185

"I hate X posts like this, I wouldn't tolerate it for Trump so I won't tolerate it for leftists either. What fraud? What is she accused of? By whom? Is there an article to go with the speculation?   If a tweet about Trump had the same lack of details I would dismiss it. I'm sure I can Google it, but accounts like this act like they are breaking news but don't elaborate. It's called leading report so report.  This contributes to people being misled, I hate when the left or right do this shit. It's a headline without an article. ",mattcruise,2025-04-18T12:20:30,45
It's hilarious she denied this. It's no secret she claimed the home in Virginia as her primary residence. I hope she pleads not guilty,fordr015,2025-04-18T14:12:34,48
"Mortgage and wire fraud, which if you did actually look it up, they have her dead to rights on.  Lied about other properties, lied about primary resident, appears to have claimed her dad was her spouse.  I'm not saying this X post is any good, but the facts of the case are really bad for her, which is good for the country.",FourtyMichaelMichael,2025-04-18T12:57:42,101
"All one has to do is to look up her deed and mortgage note on the VA's county's public database. The mortgage note states owner occupancy.   It's all there and it spells out the fraud.  I know this for a fact because I was in the real estate financing industry for yrs.  As far as her 1983 mortgage where she listed her father as being her husband, though it's beyond the statue of limitations and nothing can be done about it, the most likely reason she stated it on that mtg is because she needed her father's income to qualify.  Her father most likely owned his own home at the time which would disqualify him as being on an owner occupied mtg .  Listing him as a husband was the easiest way to use his income in income and debt ratios.  There are sufficient details about James's fraud but mainstream media continues to look the other way and gives a vague reporting of the real story.

You should look at the Actual Justice Warrior video of Tish James. He was the first one to post a video about this story.     Turns out the guy who runs the white collar fraud website is an accountant who has experience in prosecuting white collar crime - he is a former convicted felon who helped uncover fraud in his own company - he helped the federal government to catch bad actors. Sam E. Antar is his name. He then became an accountant who has experience in getting accounting fraudsters.    So he has some credibility. This wasn't initiated by the trump administration.,One_Fix5763,2025-04-18T23:03:24,5

"Absolutely, but the point is correct about the X posts like this, and this content “creator” has been VERY active on X and does this a lot. Just screen caps a headline, adds a sentence or two then has nothing else.  It’s frustrating, and it’s basically engagement spam.  Just trying to get clicks and views, but the super lazy way.  Most folks who post on X make sure the post has a story or such. Not just a headline.",cliffotn,2025-04-18T14:51:23,7

"Yeah, my point isn't I don't believe it or I don't know how to look it up. My point is I hate the trend of easy digestible information, in blurbs but lacking details, especially in this case as it's presented like breaking news. Like it's bad enough people just read headlines and don't bother with the remaining context in the article but this doesn't come with an article.    People walk around thinking they know current events because they read what amounts to a headline and dive no deeper. You could say ""Trump insults a crippled veteran"" ( just an example I made up fyi) in a headline or in this case a tweet referencing a article you don't provided and many people, I would say the majority would take that information, store it and not bother with the context. Meanwhile the story could be Trump insulted cripple veteran of the Mexican Cartel, who illegally crossed the border and murdered a child. The insult was that Trump called him a animal. Totally different context.   Now again I'm not saying that is the case with this story, I just hate the lack of context regardless of where my bias lands",mattcruise,2025-04-19T01:01:32,0

"PS.  I knew 4 persons who got indicted for mtg fraud.  The real estate closing atty got 12 yrs, the 2nd atty who worked for the closing atty got 5 yrs for his role in the fraud schemes, and the other 2 non-legal involved got 5 yrs.  These were federal indictments so every day was served and these people were sent to prisons out of the state.",Fa-ern-height451,2025-04-18T20:30:25,5
