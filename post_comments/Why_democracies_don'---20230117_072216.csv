"This was done in 1984. The CIA provided arms and training in their use to a small group of rebels in Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen. These later became the Taliban. Perky little upstarts, weren't they?  One of the issues with supplying rebels is in discovering what their actual agenda is. Rebel groups come and go and morph into other forms as a matter of necessity. They are also susceptible to being subverted by other groups. This is much more difficult to do with a ""government in exile"" or a challenger who may have lost an election fairly or otherwise. Their agenda is generally pretty well established, and this can lend an air of legitimacy to an arms provider. Consider, for instance, the Colombian rebels who were supplied arms by the CIA and how Ronald Reagan referred to them as ""freedom fighters"". The fact that payment was made in cocaine was disregarded until the Iran-Contra Congressional hearings.",DevCatOTA,2023-01-18T00:59:35,16
"Boy the Bush and Nixon administrations would have loved this question lol. What you’re talking about is neo-conservativism.   The reason Iran has a dictatorship now is because the US and Britain overthrew their democratically elected leader. The US armed militants in Guatemala known as the Contras who butchered entire villages, children and all. NATO armed “freedom fighters” in Libya who then reinstated the slave trade. We armed “freedom fighters” in Syria as well- rival Islamist terrorist organizations.   Historically, “humanitarian interventions” or “spreading democracy” or arming “freedom fighters” is an excuse to pillage resources or overthrow a government that isn’t sharing those resources or has otherwise become unpleasant to our eyes. The fact that people in western countries, believe- without ever questioning it or experiencing a single degree of self awareness- that all the countries with socialist governments or with resources that won’t share them with us or who otherwise muck up our plans are all “dictatorships” is proof of how well they’ve trained us. Isn’t it a bit of a strange coincidence that’s the case? Isn’t it a bit weird that the US is a global empire with military bases in dozens of countries but the official story is that we just don’t do propaganda, right? We have honest media with no interests other telling the truth. It’s not at all strange that the only thing we know about other countries that aren’t in our sphere of influence is that they’re bad? Seems awfully convenient.  In the early 00s, the airwaves were awash in horror stories about what a terrible dictator Saddam Hussein was, how the US military will be greeted as liberators when they invade, how we’re spreading democracy, and how we’re a force for good in the world. It was all, 100%, lies. And the vast majority of propaganda campaigns used to shore up support for intervention or arming rebels today are still lies. There are tyrannical governments out there, sure, but the approved news- what is allowed to be posted in r/worldNews for example- rarely creates a narrative that says the Saudi government needs to be overthrown. Or that Modi’s BJP in India is literally a racial purist National Socialist party whose members do pograms to Muslims. Or Erdogan in Turkey (can’t trash talk a NATO ally that can churn out drones, even if he’s put over 10,000 journalists in prison). We never hear a narrative about how they have to go. But Iran, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, all the places with resources we want (or are otherwise blocking our access to resources) have had endless op eds written about how and why their governments could be overthrown. We don’t arm the Myanmar rebels because they are leftist rebels. Same as how we didn’t like the FARC in Colombia. Same in Vietnam. Same in Angola. We overthrew a democratically elected government in Chile, had their president murdered in the attack, and the Chilean constitution still says taxes can’t be raised past a certain amount. Intervention and arming “freedom fighters” will always be in the context of who “Democratic countries” dub to be their enemies. Atrocities that we don’t mind will never reach the airwaves. By default, the only interests that can be supported with a policy such as this are western, American, European interests. I.e $$$$$$$.  The “good guys vs bad guys” narrative, I’m sorry to tell you, is simply not real life.",demouseonly,2023-01-17T23:29:30,23
How are they going to give them arms?  How are they going to make sure the protestors know how to use them?  Which protest/rebel group should they support?  What are the actual chances it will work?  And do the protestors actually want arms?  These are questions that states pretty much ask when these kinds of situations pop up.  Countries are not going to take the risk and resources to send arms to a situation where they don't think the protestors have a chance to win nor if the protestors are not in-line with the countries best interests.,Naliamegod,2023-01-17T23:17:53,8

"Ignoring the realpolitik proxy warfare stuff which only uses idealism for moral justification for a second  Realpolitik and perfidy over idealism is a tradition that stretches back to the founding fathers (US is considered the earliest modern democracy, and most powerful democracy). The US received substantial direct French military aid (to this day many US places are named after Lafayette, the hero of two worlds, and revolutions) and loans (the loans mostly negotiated by Franklin) during the American revolution. When the French monarchy was deposed, the US refused to pay debts to the newly founded French Republic (despite support from the idealistic yet hypocritically slave-owning Francophile Jefferson). Instead the US chose to funnel money to the French military dictator (and Emperor of the French) Napoleon through the Louisiana purchase. Napoleon had no means of actually keeping control over the French colony and all but abandoned the idea of an empire that stretched to the Americas, but he was desperately in need of cash during the peninsular war so he readily made the trade of an asset he could not retain for money to finance war on the continent.  So that's how it was. The United States, since its founding, was based on perfidy, throwing freedom fighting ideological comrades under the bus, and funding military dictatorships in their place.",nerdygeekwad,2023-01-18T04:10:17,2
"This is a foreign policy question so the answer is power.  As others have explained in more detail, it's not like states (democracies or not) *don't* arm rebels, but the motivation simply isn't to get rid of dictatorships, but to increase power. Are there natural resources? Strengthening a group that is aligned (at least short term) with your interests, or outright invasion, are on the table. Do they share a common enemy (e.g. neighboring state) that could be hurt this way? Military support is on the table.  Getting rid of a dictatorship (assuming that would be the actual outcome of an intervention) without also increasing your own power simply isn't interesting to states. An intervention has diplomatic and monetary costs, and achieving something idealistic like improving people's self-determination is not viewed as a good return on investment.",Silly-Freak,2023-01-18T05:48:45,2
"Maybe, and just maybe, because every country is already facing their own problems? Citizens pay living in civilization via taxation, taxation which returns on public goods.  If my very own country (Chile) had interests on a certain region I would understand foreign aid at most, but otherwise I wouldn't want our budget to play world police while we have our own problems here.",MrSpeedball,2023-01-17T23:06:30,2
"Well, sometimes democracies do that. In fact, one of the reasons America has received criticism over the years is because they have given arms support or gone to war in cases of disputed governance. America alone has done of a ton of interventions, including supporting revolutions, coups, and rebellions, in Latin American countries, Southeast Asia, and Africa. But that's only a very simplistic answer and there's much more complication than that.  For one thing, part of the issue is that history is full of dictatorships getting overthrown by well-meaning revolutionaries, only for those folks to become dictators themselves. A great example is Afghanistan. Afghanistan was ruled by a relatively stable monarchy for a long time, until that monarchy was overthrown due to corruption and other normal monarchy problems. But there wasn't really a single group in place strong enough to provide an actual better government. The strongest group was the Communists, who appealed to the USSR for help and eventually armed support of their claim. But the Communists proved to be terrible at actually governing, choosing to rule through terror and violence far worse than the monarchy ever was, despite constant pleas from the USSR to become effective governors. As a result, the other factions that were vying for power never quite went away, and so many of them got foreign support to help overthrow the USSR-backed Communist regime. These groups became known as the Mujahedeen, a loose grouping of various different anti-Communist factions, including aggressive religious nuts like the Taliban. When the Communists were eventually defeated, the noble revolutionaries then had sort out the goal of governing and it turns out that the Taliban emerged as the most powerful and effective governing group. Oops.  There are other examples. The US backed Josef Mbotu in the Congo because the leadership before him was brutal and corrupt...except Mbotu was even worse. Supporting Deng in Vietnam was supposed to be about helping a colonialist people liberate themselves...but it ended up being a war of foreign oppression. One of the main reasons that democracies don't always get involved is because a revolution doesn't always imply better change.  But even before we get to the practical concerns, you have to remember that a democracy's goal is to take care of itself, not better the world for everyone. Statecraft and governing are inherently selfish things. So why would a democracy that is stable and rich and overall doing pretty well in the world, want to encourage change in the global order that could threaten that? Revolutions are destabilizing. Democracies need resources from countries that are autocratic. What benefit does a western democracy actually get in having Saudi Arabia go through a bloody civil war? Gas prices would skyrocket. Sure, the West would prefer if Saudi Arabian citizens had political rights...but honestly that doesn't override other concerns.",mormagils,2023-01-18T09:13:00,1
"> The CIA provided arms and training in their use to a small group of rebels in Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen. These later became the Taliban. Perky little upstarts, weren't they?  The Mujahedeen did not become the Taliban as the Taliban were the group that ended the Mujahedeen as we know it.  The Mujahedeen would try to form a government after the Soviets left but would eventually fall into conflict with each other.  The Taliban, who were pretty much created and funded by Pakistan, would rise in popularity in reaction to the chaos of the Mujahedeen warlords and overthrow the government.  The Mujahedeen leadership either fled the country or would form the Northern Alliance to continue the fight against the Taliban.  While much of the military leadership of the Taliban were veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war, much of their support and numbers came mostly from returning Afghan refugees who had been in Pakistan during the war and had been radicalized by the religious groups in Pakistan.  Also, the CIA didn't train anyone in Afghanistan.  The USA had no physical presence in Afghanistan until we invaded and thus acted as arms dealers but relied on Pakistan to actually train and arm the Afghan Mujahedeen.  This would prove a problem because Pakistan would give most of its support to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a fundamentalist Pashturn warlord, who is notable of being one of the nastiest warlords in a group of nasty warlords.  Pakistan would eventually get tired of him, which is what lead to them supporting the Taliban.",Naliamegod,2023-01-18T03:43:17,8

"Going further back, foreign intervention for US economic interests and profiteering has been going on for a long time (i.e. banana republics), although it used to be much more direct before the cold war. There was a book published in 1935 called ""War is a Racket"" by 2-star General Smedley D.
