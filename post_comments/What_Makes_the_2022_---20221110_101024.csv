"Basically, everyone expected Republicans to have a massive victory; instead, they lost the senate and will only win the house by a very narrow margin.   Midterm elections are elections that take place two years after the presidential election, and historically, the President's party does extremely poorly. In 2018 the Republicans lost 41 seats in the House; in 2010, the Democrats lost 61 seats in the house. Combine that with 40 years of high inflation and Biden's approval ratings being the lowest of any post-war President going into the midterms, even with Republicans squeaking by in the House (which they probably will); this is the best result for a President's party in a midterm since 2004.",loselyconscious,2022-11-13T21:32:11,2
"Almost without exception, in the US midterm races, the Presidential party loses big. Midterms are races where the President isn't up for election, so it's just a third of our upper house and the whole lower house of the legislature. This tends to create a situation where voters are both less motivated because the ""big kahuna"" isn't running, and it's easy to frame the election as an evaluation of the President's party so far...which because it's politics is rarely favorable to the president. You could argue (I very much do argue) that this structure where the president's party straight always loses barring EXTREMELY unusual circumstances is a design flaw, but that's a different point.  So in this election, somehow, the Dems have actually not lost big. They could possibly have gained in the upper house, and at the very least broke even, and in the lower house, the Dems entered with a very slim 5 seat majority and will somehow probably not lose more than net 7 or 8 seats, and possibly the Dems will actually keep the lower house entirely by losing fewer than 5 net seats. That's literally a historically good midterm outcome, which is astounding because there's not really anything that would lead to that. For reference, in the modern US era, the President's party losing fewer than 5 seats in a midterm has only happened 3 times, total, in 1962, 1998, and 2002.  In 1962, that was right after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis, quite possibly the most stunning diplomatic achievement of the century. In 1998, that was after the Reps impeached Bill Clinton over a personal moral lapse, a move widely seen a divisively partisan that actually *improved* Clinton's reputation with voters. In 2002, that was right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In all these cases, there was a major historically significant, hugely impactful moment in the administration that changed the game. But Biden seems to lack that kind of moment, but still had a result similar to these events anyway. That is truly remarkable, and the Reps are rightly freaking out that they so drastically underperformed expectations.  EDIT: Actually, looking back, there's a good chance that the *Dobbs* decision that overturned *Roe v. Wade* will be the asterisk-creating event that will make the pattern along with those other three historical events. I mean, we still don't *quite* know the results of the election, so whether it's really a true asterisk election or a close one (if the Reps pick up 7 seats and win the House narrowly that's way different than if they pick up fewer than 5 seats and Dems keep the House). But the point is, going into the election, it looked like the impact of *Dobbs* was fading...and now maybe we see that it did not.",mormagils,2022-11-14T10:16:10,1
