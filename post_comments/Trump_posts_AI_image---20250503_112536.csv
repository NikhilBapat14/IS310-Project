Moreover, and with all due respect, I'm not the only Catholic who has had to be surprised by having it waved in his face-- I have every right to explain my distaste when people disallow me from ignoring the president, I have every right to take offense when I can explain the justification for it, and I have every right to attempt to elucidate a person who seems genuinely unaware of any reason someone wouldn't like such a thing.

It's just a picture there's no deep meaning behind it.  Trump went to the former Pope's funeral and clearly paid his respects with empathy.",Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-03T21:06:50,-9
"Forgive me for not being outraged over a meme during the ""novendiale formal mourning period"". Plenty of distasteful and unstatesmanlike implications to unpack, indeed.",dontbedenied,2025-05-03T16:04:21,-4
If you can't see the joke then you are too deep in the deadly sin of pride simple as.,kaytin911,2025-05-03T14:29:26,6
The problem is you are taking in the deadly sin of pride. You should be thinking of how nice it is that we have a president that understands technology instead of being offended by it and wanting it banned and crippling our future. Are you also the type that is offended that he tried peace talks with adversaries?,kaytin911,2025-05-03T14:28:42,-4
💀 that's on me. I didn't have the right definition  I thought the word meant an attack on the religion or an aspect of it. Sorry bud,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-05-03T14:42:45,5
Look at it this way.   To a lot of Catholics the pope is as close to god as you can get on earth.  If libs dropped some joke memes a lil bit after trump kicks it I doubt any of us will be laughing.,nocicept1,2025-05-03T16:10:46,10
That's ok.  I don't imagine explaining viewpoints is your strong suit.,Pertinacious,2025-05-03T19:36:24,8
"I specifically said that I'm not calling for censorship. Banning technology wasn't even on the table. There's no reason to equate the posting of an AI image with understanding technology, nor any reason to equate being offended because of my religious convictions with calling for a ban on technology. I didn't even call for the image to be taken down, as you recall. I only tried to explain why someone would be offended to people who claimed that there was no reason to be offended.  If you're suggesting that we shouldn't call out distasteful behavior out of some loyalty we owe the president, then I don't think I can agree with that. If you're suggesting that an AI generated position for which Trump is unqualified is the same as peace talks with enemy states, then I'd like to remind you that the Vatican is a foreign state that we are on friendly terms with. It's just as distasteful if the image had been as the Dalai Lama, after he had died, or the state garb of another head of state after they had died. I'm sorry that my reasons for being offended by one, one, thing that my president's administration put out are unsatisfactory to you, but your accusations are way out of line.",Professor_Seven,2025-05-03T14:55:01,12
