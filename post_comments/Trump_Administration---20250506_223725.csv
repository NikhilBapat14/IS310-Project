Is someone tracking who voted for what and then we can refuse that treatment to said individuals come time for their health/wellbeing to benefit from the discoveries of whatever Harvard research was privately funded from this day forward?,1xhill_climb,2025-05-07T08:21:22,2

This guy just does not get it. Research grants can equal medical advancement which is “WINNING.” But we’re tired of so much winning.,pasarina,2025-05-07T07:59:48,1

Archive link https://archive.is/e8vWG  Edit: a second article worth reading  https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harvard-trump-grants-doe-mcmahon-letter-rcna205180  Who on earth is downvoting this? Giving you a link to freely access the first article and adding a second article that helps you learn more is downvote-worthy?
