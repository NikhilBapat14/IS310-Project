"Paywall liberated from Vox: [https://archive.is/ISlif](https://archive.is/ISlif)  >   On May 15, the Supreme Court will hear three cases — consolidated under the name [*Trump v. CASA*](https://archive.is/o/ISlif/https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/trump-v-casa-inc/) — which concern his unconstitutional attempt to [strip many Americans born in the United States of citizenship](https://archive.is/o/ISlif/https://www.vox.com/immigration/395945/donald-trump-unconstitutional-birthright-citizenship-illegal).
