"Every time Carville's name is dropped by an article as some sort of authority on what makes Democrats win, I'm compelled to repeat this:  Carville's claim to fame was winning the White House over 30 years ago with 43% of the popular vote.  Even assuming he was good then (and that's a generous assumption) his opinion doesn't reflect a post-Trump electorate.",SISWIWH,2025-04-26T23:29:53,23

"This freak hasn't been relevant since the early 90's and I didn't like him then.  Who cares what he says?  He's a piece of trash IMO...  Carville was retained by [Palantir Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies) as a paid adviser in 2011, and was instrumental in bringing about Palantir's collaboration with the [New Orleans Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Police_Department) to quietly deploy predictive policing software in [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans).",steerpike1138,2025-04-26T21:59:40,30

Fuck Carville also MSNBC was pushing AOC should not run because only white people like her and she is out of touch with the Democratic base. Its already becoming clear the neoliberal establishment and its media are going to do the same with her as they did with Bernie. We will be hearing plenty more from Carville because i am sure old media will want him on to punch left as much as possible.,sedatedlife,2025-04-26T22:13:16,10

She's certainly trending that way, but it still remains to be seen.
