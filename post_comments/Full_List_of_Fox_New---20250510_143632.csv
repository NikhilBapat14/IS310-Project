"SUMMARY:   President Donald Trump's decision to tap **Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia** continues to showcase the tight relationship he has maintained with the network throughout both of his administrations.  **Pirro is the 23rd current or former Fox News employee Trump has recruited** for his administration since taking office earlier this year.  During his first administration, Trump regularly called Fox News hosts live on air to have impromptu, off-the-cuff interviews.  In his second administration by appointing hosts, many of **whom have only ever had glowing praise for Trump during their broadcasts, to key Cabinet positions and high-profile roles**.  LIST:  + The highest profile picks have been Pete Hegseth, one of the hosts of Fox & Friends Weekend, who took over the Pentagon as secretary of defence.  + Dan Bongino - deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  + Michael Waltz, Trump's new United Nations ambassador.  + Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and current ambassador to Israel.

We warned of this prior to Trump's first term. Soon Fox will be our official state-run news outlet privy before anyone else to all the lies the Trump Administration spews. I wouldn't be surprised if Fox gets its own prime office in the White House.,invalidpassword,2025-05-10T14:48:00,1

Fox News is running a literal temp agency for the White House. With a 94% turnover Trump's last term... I expect Hannity will finally get a temp job in the WH at some point. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,williamgman,2025-05-10T16:14:58,1

"It makes perfect sense when you look to the CCP for an example.  In America we find the convolution of political party and administrative state to be anathema. It‚Äôs perfectly natural in other, almost universally, authoritarian states. Power, progress, and profit comes from party loyalty and creates an incentive for political and individual loyalty even when it requires suppressing any sense of honesty, ethics, or morality. In attempt to remake the administrative state into a political (re: Republican) machine it makes sense to fill it with the most politically active and vocal propagandists. This is done by shamelessly rewarding them for political and individual loyalty. Competence is an acceptable casualty at this phase of the transition, as appointing and hiring non-partisan actors runs contrary to the process of consolidating power. That‚Äôs the naked truth here, this isn‚Äôt even about pushing Republican policy at this point, it‚Äôs about ensuring that the entire system is irrevocably controlled by one hyper-loyal group of people kept onboard and in check by their shameless opportunism.  Edit: Forgot to add, this is also where ‚Äúreligion‚Äù comes into play despite the obvious lack of morality. The ‚Äúright‚Äù kind of religion shares a massive, if not surface level, overlap with Republican ‚Äúvalues‚Äù. Where they can‚Äôt get state political indoctrination to take root they can circumvent it through ‚Äúpro-religion/freedom of religion‚Äù initiatives into non-political areas of civil society.   The average state employee in the PRC spends several hours of their week receiving ‚Äúpolitical training‚Äù and until they can get that up and running, Sunday morning will have to do.",GenerationalNeurosis,2025-05-10T16:33:45,1

So he does this because he trusts them. He trusts people who verbally fellate him...and probably actually fellate him.   But if you read into that. Why the fuck does an 80 year old billionaire not have a lifetime of connections he made and trusts already? Oh yea cause he betrayed them all.,SaltyLonghorn,2025-05-10T15:27:44,1
