"I think many Trump supporting Americans are going to receive a rude awakening with respect to how important soft power is in geopolitics.  Yes, the United States has the world's largest military, and it's not even close. But the American status as a superpower isn't solely rooted in fear or awe of its military, but rather in its stability, its reliability, and its consistency. If American foreign policy and trade policies are going to undergo drastic and unpredictable swings every four years, the world will look elsewhere for those qualities.  If the United States is seen by most of the world as an irrational, untrustworthy, unreliable, and vindictive global superpower...that is going to have ripple effects that will span for decades.",Stoic_acorn,2025-04-22T14:07:30,6

For most of American political history, the liberal & urban party has been run out of bars--why rural bigots went after bars so hard with prohibition. Regular communication to the electorate was not done by media-savvy, trained professionals with Polisci degrees. Disinformation and fake news absolutely ran rampant and high-charisma people just shooting shit in bars absolutely had a higher political impact than we'd like.  Imo one of the defining political trends is that we Dems/liberals have completely forgotten how to communicate at this level. For the most part, we *only* message at the high-political-engagement, highly institutional, formalized level. These new social media types, your Joe Rogans? Pretty sure they're a lot closer to the old norm for communicators.  We as a party blame the electorate a lot for this shift. But honestly, I think a lot of this is on us--we've undertaken a decades-long experiment with a new political communication style and it's utterly failed.

On the other, one of the most frustrating things about watching Trump's rise as a populist-pragmatic Dem is that this is the stupid-evil version of exactly what many of us have wanted for decades. I grew up in the rustbelt surrounded by unemployed former-union members in a crime-ridden city that'd been economically devastated by neoliberalism.  I would've done anything for some good-faith tariffs and more local infrastructure & manufacturing investment. Private health insurance has likely murdered, maimed, and tortured tens of millions of Americans over the years--maybe more. Those companies make Al Qaeda look like chump-change amateurs when it comes to killing Americans. I would kill for a Dem president to treat that like a state of emergency.  Yes, I'm a Dem and a strong believer in democracy. But I've spent my whole life watching other countries just *get things done* in a way we cannot. They greenlit and funded high speed rail for the Midwest in what, mid 2000s? I'd be surprised if we saw any of it in my lifetime. Similar story for housing construction, urban planning, and overall infrastructure in most places I've lived. Austin was supposed to have a beltway/ring road, but Loop 360 has been neither a loop nor 360 for decades because people (especially homeowner associations) have been arguing for about 40 years on where to connect the sides. Can you imagine some homeowner complainers stalling infrastructure millions of people need for *lifetimes* in Singapore or China? Or even Western Europe, where infrastructure timelines make ours look like sick jokes even in democratic countries where the state can't just get things done?
