"Affiliates from Elon Musk’s so-called [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/) have significant access to 19 sensitive systems at the [Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.wired.com/story/department-health-human-services-possible-collapse/), according to a recent court filing. Nine of those are previously undisclosed.  This wide-ranging access, which includes a centralized accounting system for all [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS)](https://www.wired.com/story/dr-oz-ai-health-care-medicare-cms-town-hall/) programs, the cloud for a “robust” and “high-volume data warehouse,” and several additional HHS accounting systems that pay government contractors, demonstrates the breadth of DOGE’s takeover at the federal agency charged with securing health care for millions of Americans.

" Meanwhile:  [A whistleblower's disclosure details how DOGE may have taken sensitive labor data](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security)  >But according to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with Congress and other federal overseers that was obtained by NPR, subsequent interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. It's possible that the data included sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets — data that four labor law experts tell NPR should almost never leave the NLRB and that has nothing to do with making the government more efficient or cutting spending.  >Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.   ...   Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were ""near real-time,"" according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T15:37:59,7
