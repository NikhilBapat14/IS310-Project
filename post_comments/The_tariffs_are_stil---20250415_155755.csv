STOP TARIFFISM!!!!,BudMan413,2025-04-16T20:25:17,1
"1. Trump is negotiating with 50+ countries to get 0-0% taxes, meaning everything will be cheaper once the deal is made. Rough before easy. 2. How on earth does Karmelo’s bond get reduced to 250k, gets set free, AND buys a new house when he brought a KNIFE to a track meet and murdered a kid? He also had charges for bringing a knife to school before. Explain this to me, PLEASE. And no, I am not Republican, nor Democrat. I am open to anything.",Streberfpv,2025-04-15T18:23:08,-7

Im not paying attention to that case. The biggest problem in the U.S. right now is the tariffs that could potentially ruin the U.S economy for generations. And after all the lies that have come out of Trumps mouth how can you trust anything he says? We wont be in the clear until he is out of office.,MaximusDM22,2025-04-15T19:52:55,5

"Oh yeah 100%, but from recent trends it’s a LOT more likely to fix our economy, but we will see! Agreed, but you also cant just target Trump, almost if not all politicians are corrupt. I don’t feel like Trump is “that” corrupt, but he’s definitely gone back on what he’s said. I hope he will be a good president, but you never know. ",Streberfpv,2025-04-15T20:25:33,-4
"At first I held out hope that he wouldnt be that bad, but he has quickly dashed those hopes. Ruining the economy, ignoring the courts, and targeting people he doesnt agree with are just a few issues already. Imo he has already caused so much damage to the economy and U.S. institutions that he should resign or be impeached. J.D. Vance should be better and he is popular in the Republican party as far as I can tell.",MaximusDM22,2025-04-15T20:44:35,3
