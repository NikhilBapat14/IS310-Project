"Can’t fly into Newark Airport, half filled container ships, looking like no flu or covid shot next fall, but hey at least someone who’s wants to serve this country in their own skin is getting the heave-ho.   I’m so glad we’re great again.",lifeat24fps,2025-05-06T16:02:04,20
"It’s just blind hate and their own conservative identity politics. This doesn’t make the USA any safer, and the whole EO justifies the ban by saying that trans people are inherently “dishonorable.”   At what point is the average American going to be fed up with this sort of hateful nonsense?",rockandrollzomby,2025-05-06T15:51:34,19
">Lawyers for the trans servicemembers argued that thousands of transgender people would be discharged while the court challenges are heard, a process that could take years. They said that the executive order plainly states that it’s based on animus towards trans people, just in the language it uses about trans people not being honorable. Moreover, they argued that transgender people have served in the military throughout the Biden administration without any issues, citing studies that military readiness isn’t affected by trans people serving openly.  Christian nationalists are basically trying to eradicate any avenue for trans people to live. It's a genocide. Trans people have served honorably in the military for generations, and now, Republicans are saying they can't serve their country.     This is why other nations are saying to trans people to flee America and to never come back. We're the nation that is enacting genocidal mania against trans people, even in the military to serve their country.     What kind of shit is this but a genocide?",southpawFA,2025-05-06T15:50:42,26

"OK but like isn't the whole point of the military to have ppl. Like shouldn't they take everyone they can get? Don't we want a large military? Like I rlly don't think, to dumb being transgender down, someone changing their hormone levels, possibly having surgery to change parts, changing your name, asking ppl to say he instead of she or vice versa, or changing your appearance had anything to do with military readiness. I know it's more complicated I'm just saying from like a we need ppl to hold guns and shoot perspective, it's rlly not. Like it's plain discriminatory. Like there is no arguement in favor for the ban where hate for trans ppl doesn't come up. I guess their argument is that since trans ppl are trans and the government doesn't like that it's like disloyal or they have like bad ideological views or smth. I really cannot understand the reasoning, I'm trying to wrap my head around why. There literally isn't one, they just are discriminating against trans ppl. Being trans doesn't prevent you from holding a gun and firing. I mean maybeee I get the medical argument but even that is really weak. Like you don't need to like fire all trans ppl. I think it's just wrong and it's rlly concerning how there is no explanation but hate for trans ppl.",IcyBand4448,2025-05-07T14:06:42,1
"How utterly  disgusting. Another hateful Revengeful act by the Supreme Court sanctioned by Donald Trump.  Does the Trump administration going to do anything good for anyone?  They need to leave our service people alone and let them serve honorably. There are already rules in place to guide their service. Why harass people.  No doubt this kind of bullshit is being done to take Americans focus off of things like housing, lack of healthcare, pharmaceutical costs, infrastructure issues and the list is long and goes on.",thomport,2025-05-06T18:53:34,0

"That is such a bad faith question, but I’ll respond.   This comes straight from the US Holocaust Museum: “Genocide is an internationally recognized crime where acts are committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. These acts fall into five categories: 1-Killing members of the group 2-Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group 3-Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part 4-Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group 5-Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”  The federal government absolutely is inflicting at least two of those violent acts upon trans people in the USA right now. All of these laws are an attempt to make it so that trans people cannot exist in public life.   What’s happening now is very similar to how the holocaust began: “on 6 May 1933, the Institute of Sexology, an academic foundation devoted to sexological research and the advocacy of homosexual rights, was broken into and occupied by Nazi-supporting youth. Several days later the entire contents of the library were removed and burned.”  It starts with attacking academics (we’re doing that right now), it progresses to limiting rights of undesirables (this is clear in this anti trans military ban), and ends up with forced expulsion or group internment (thankfully we’re not there yet, but why do we think this admin is so hell bent on being able to send American citizens to El Salvador.  I know this won’t change your mind given your comment history, but know that you are wrong and doing nothing but making innocent lives worse for no reason.",rockandrollzomby,2025-05-06T16:28:49,15
"Genocide never just happens. There is always a set of circumstances which occur or which are created to build the climate in which genocide can take place.  Gregory H Stanton, President of [Genocide Watch](http://www.genocidewatch.com/) developed the 10 stages of genocide which explains the different stages which lead to genocide. At each of the earlier stages there is an opportunity for members of the community or the International Community to halt the stages and stop genocide before it happens.     The 10 stages are:  1.  **Classification** – The differences between people are not respected. There’s a division of ‘us’ and ‘them’ which can be carried out using stereotypes, or excluding people who are perceived to be different. 2. **Symbolisation** – This is a visual manifestation of hatred. Jews in Nazi Europe were forced to wear yellow stars to show that they were ‘different’. 3. **Discrimination** – The dominant group denies civil rights or even citizenship to identified groups. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, made it illegal for them to do many jobs or to marry German non-Jews. 4. **Dehumanisation** – Those perceived as ‘different’ are treated with no form of human rights or personal dignity. During the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as ‘cockroaches’; the Nazis referred to Jews as ‘vermin’. 5. **Organisation** – Genocides are always planned. Regimes of hatred often train those who go on to carry out the destruction of a people. 6. **Polarisation** – Propaganda begins to be spread by hate groups. The Nazis used the newspaper Der Stürmer to spread and incite messages of hate about Jewish people. 7. **Preparation** – Perpetrators plan the genocide. They often use euphemisms such as the Nazis’ phrase ‘The Final Solution’ to cloak their intentions. They create fear of the victim group, building up armies and weapons. 8. **Persecution** – Victims are identified because of their ethnicity or religion and death lists are drawn up. People are sometimes segregated into ghettos, deported or starved and property is often expropriated. Genocidal massacres begin. 9. **Extermination** – The hate group murders their identified victims in a deliberate and systematic campaign of violence. Millions of lives have been destroyed or changed beyond recognition through genocide. 10. **Denial** – The perpetrators or later generations deny the existence of any crime.  I'm pretty sure calling trans people a ""dishonor to the country"" is blatant polarization and persecution.",southpawFA,2025-05-06T16:16:54,11
