I  have such a visceral hate for this man.   from Wikipedia: His mother's ancestors Louis W. Glosser (originally named Wolf-Lieb Glosser or Glatzer/Glotzer) and his wife Bessie emigrated to the United States from the Russian Empire's Antopol, in what is present-day Belarus, escaping the 1903–06 anti-Jewish pogroms in Belarus and other parts of the Russian Empire. When his great-grandmother arrived in the U.S. in 1906, she spoke only Yiddish, the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. Miller's uncle recalls that, when Wolf-Lieb Glosser reached Ellis Island on January 7, 1903 with $8 to his name, ""[t]hough fluent in Polish, Russian and Yiddish, he understood no English.""",ItsTricky94,2025-05-05T11:09:50,5

"A former White House colleague of Stephen Miller had some things to get off her chest about him over the weekend, revealing why she believes he is a “horrible human being.”  Olivia Troye, who served as homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence, scorched President Donald Trump’s top White House aide on a Sunday episode of the To The Contrary podcast.  “I think what you see is what you get with him,” Troye said when political commentator Charlie Sykes asked her about Miller. “He is a horrible human being. I think he is someone who has gone all in, down the rabbit hole, on extremism. And I think in his mind, there would be no migrants, immigrants, or any mixed race in our country.”   Troye said she had sat in many senior-level Cabinet meetings throughout multiple administrations but never seen anyone talk like Miller.  “I’ve heard him pontificate. He does it in a very bullying type of way,” she said. “I’ve never seen anyone talk down to people in that manner and lecture them, and we’re talking about things like, when he would say, ‘Do you want a bunch of Iraqi communities around this country?’ He’s very specific in his language about it.”  Miller, 39, has been a trusted ally since joining Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. He was a senior adviser in the first Trump administration and currently serves as the White House deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser.  “I see him now, he is double-down emboldened,” Troye said. “He believes that he’s got all of the power. He’s Trump’s right-hand person… We know that he is all about using lawfare for whatever purpose.”   Miller is widely credited as the architect of both Trump administrations’ hardline immigration policies. As the president works to deliver on his long-promised mass deportation blitz, Miller has stood at the forefront in defending the government’s sweeping crackdown.  Last month, Miller railed against Democrats for demanding due process for immigrants being deported by the Trump administration, and accused “communist left-wing judges” of blocking the president’s agenda.  His dedication appears to be paying off. Miller is reportedly a leading choice for national security adviser, following Mike Waltz’s ouster in the wake of a Signal fiasco in which the former congressman accidentally added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat that contained Trump’s top national security officials.  “Stephen Miller’s at the top of the totem pole,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. “I mean, I think he sort of, indirectly, already has that job because he has a lot to say about a lot of things. He’s a very valued person in the administration.”",sassafrass14,2025-05-05T11:06:52,8

And I think in his mind, there would be no migrants, immigrants, or any mixed race in our country.”  “Stephen Miller’s at the top of the totem pole,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. “I mean, I think he sort of, indirectly, already has that job because he has a lot to say about a lot of things. He’s a very valued person in the administration.”",SmartWonderWoman,2025-05-06T09:58:30,2

Heck, when I switched to working in between semesters, we were also responsible for shoveling and snow-blowing in the winters, as well as salting and sanding the walkways and driveways.    We appreciated students and staff cleaning up after themselves because it gave us more time to do other things to keep the schools looking nice.

Gen Z and millennials made it ""uncool"" to be a bully. The Movie 21 Jump Street is a very funny glimpse into school life today vs when Gen X and Boomers were in school. Bullies are no longer glorified.   It's because this dynamic no longer exists that American Millenials and Gen Z joke about how some in our parents' generation used to see bullies. Among the worst parents (the ones who are now Trump supporters), there really used to be a belief that bullies would force the weird kids to conform, and the weak ones to get strong.

Radio shows, etc.--A classmate even made a video about him for a school project.   I expected he might be the way he is because he was a bullied outcast in h.s., but it doesn't seem to be the case. He didn't have many friends, but he seemed to enjoy carrying water for unpopular (even unpalatable) opinions and enjoyed getting attention, even negative attention.

"As someone who went to an Evangelical college and rubbed shoulders with the Serena Joys of the world...  I can't speak for all MAGA women, but the ones I knew were vacant. Their eyes were utterly soulless and their smiles were creepy and fake. They all looked identical because they wore cheap MLM makeup and went to the same plastic surgeons. They have their own businesses and college degrees but simultaneously despise feminism. They live in gaudy McMansions and talk about the joys of being a mother, but never tell anyone that they have a nanny and a maid who spend more time with their children than they do. Their husbands likely cheat on them with men. (And no, I'm not making that up.)   These women will gladly marry the worst person you know in exchange for money and power. They will sacrifice every value they've ever had in order to climb the social ladder. They'll throw lifelong friends and relatives under the bus if they think they can profit from it. Insufferable isn't even the right word. It's a lack of consideration to a degree that is downright insidious.   To them, wealth is a virtue. It's all they've got to fill the void in their life, and it makes them a member of an exclusive, elite social caste. They'll do anything to protect it, and they see others bridging that gap as an affront to their lifestyle. That's why they hate any effort to lift others out of poverty. They despise people who feed the homeless and bristle at Christians who bring up the fact that Jesus would've done the same. They have zero empathy. They raise their children to be hateful little bullies. They'll set their daughters up in quasi-arranged marriages with known predators for a slight bump in social standing. They pretend to be religious but don't actually give a shit about anything the Bible says because it's just a front to hide their undiagnosed narcissism.   In short, they're monsters too.

">An economist might say with the right incentives you can get the worst people to do good things (for society)  I'm not an economist, but I feel this in my bones. Like, whenever I'm trying to solve a problem I'm thinking about causes and incentives and it blows my mind the number of people who don't seem to consider these things. At all.  Here's a good example that's politically relevant: Illegal immigration. Right now the only solutions to illegal immigration are to (for the Dems) throw an endlessly escalating amount of money into policing the border, or to (for the GOP) throw an endlessly escalating amount of money into policing the border while we also experiment with a possible sequel to the Holocaust. You cannot police people looking to improve their lives though. It can't be done. It's an innate drive in all of us. So, if you wanted to ""solve"" illegal immigration, why not tackle incentives instead?  Since policing the border at a level that would have the effect people want is impractical and impossible, we must change the calculus in the decision to immigrate. So we heavily fine businesses that hire illegal immigrants. We do that while also wiping the slate clean and giving green cards to those who are already here, so we don't topple the industries that have come to rely on them. You've now got a new base point to start from, haven't dismantled the economy, and have a sustainable solution that discourages illegal immigrants without a humanitarian crisis.

Even people who have empathy should understand that prosocial behavior is not just something that you do out of the kindness of your heart or because it feels nice, it's an important facet of being human and it benefits you, in immaterial and material ways.  People are adept at spotting prosocial traits, and shunning antisocial traits is akin to an instinct.   In the long run, antisocial behaviour most often comes around to bite people in the ass, and when it does, people lack social support. Growing up around him taught me some good lessons and some survival skills that honestly I dont like, but have served me well around people like him.. most antisocial people are easy to spot, avoid, and disarm.  I commend you on your efforts and hope you take care to also not stretch yourself too thin. Emotional labour is tiring, and going over the top can be counterproductive. Wish you all the best.",smillinkillah,2025-05-05T11:22:45,9
"That’s great for you, but that’s not what this thread is about. Miller is obviously not taking that approach and doesn’t have any incentive to. Hurting people has made him extremely rich and powerful.",pictocat,2025-05-05T12:22:39,1
"I think in Miller’s case, sadism is also baked into his personality. He derives personal satisfaction in knowing that he’s hurting those he dislikes. It’s not purely objective apathy. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-06T01:18:08,1

"This is more complicated than a reddit post but admittedly requires a lot of simple methods for implementation, for memetically effective transmission to all educational groups.   You aren't going to want to even read my greatly reduced summary of somethings to start with. But the end result will have to be things that people can do simply and incorporate in their tribal behaviors.   You have to do the things that work with propaganda, because the population doesn't have cognitive bandwidth to understand nuance.  This is a slippery slope as even Edward Bernays saw his methods as for 'social good'. Religion can have the good intentions of spreading good social behavior in large populations that can't read or right.  Etc.   Educating a populace and getting them engaged often takes a threat.     If anything the rise of this extremism is getting more people aware of how easy it is for this behavior and ideology to take root.  A tiny sparkle inside the black cloud.   You will need to  have increased penalty for misinformation and disinformation (but this very complicated to implement legal but you also have to make sure the populace values that when the populace is looking for easy answers to complex problems and you have to solve the trust networks issue)  Like many things in life you have multiple things to try and check adjust and see what works.   In the short term get involved with your local politics.   Get involved with those conversations. That local power dynamic is the best long term plan for the average person. Get involved with a be a member of your community.  Communities are the real power.   And yes there's so much much more. And the emotions are high and the repugnant ideology is going to naturally cause a a reaction but remember violence just plays into the fascist handbook.",ittleoff,2025-05-05T12:14:00,1

"I agree with maruchops and wanted to share my experience. Many people with antisocial personality disorder manipulate emotions and exploit prosocial behaviours.  Oberall, the best approach is to be civil but non commmital, guard your emotions, and be aware of potential manipulation.  If interaction is minimal, be assertive, offer little reaction, and avoid meaningful contact.  For frequent interactions, like with a difficult boss or family member, I stay assertive while placating. It's emotionally taxing, but understanding the game that's being played makes it predictable. Building other relationships helps prevent them from painting a negative picture of you. I'm kind of extroverted, so I tend to do that naturally, but in these cases, it's definitely a plus, and often, I've found mutual support in dealing with these issues.  Essentially, maintain a calm demeanour, set clear boundaries, and choose your words carefully, knowing they can be twisted against you. It's a delicate balance: avoid fully revealing your thoughts, don't endorse things you disagree with, and stay loyal to those you trust. Meanwhile, remain non-committal, placate when necessary, and gently nudge them towards more positive behaviour.   Sometimes, a genuine act of kindness can be disarming to someone with apd if there's no expectations or commmital. When I do, it's because I want to do it, and I avoid being predictable.  I used to struggle with this, feeling manipulative myself, but therapy helped me understand it as a self-defense mechanism. The hyper vigilance is part of the PTSD I had to deal with, but its not something I can fully turn off. In the end, it's a valuable skill when needed. I can relax and let it go completely with trusted people, and that is truly precious.  Edit- Apologies, this isn't a TLDR xD",smillinkillah,2025-05-05T20:02:05,2
