"Yes, agreed. It needs to be reinstated once (if?) we get on the other side of this nonsense",LibertyCash,2025-03-30T18:44:15,12
"I don’t see how the Fairness Doctrine had anything to do with this situation. Most of this is from social media or cable or online news sources, none of which is under the FCC’s jurisdiction.",AmbulanceChaser12,2025-03-30T19:08:02,13
Correct.   I wish Reagan was never elected.,Lost-Task-8691,2025-03-31T06:59:12,2
Thank Ronald Reagan for that…Republicans need to cheat somehow in order for people to vote against their own interests.,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-03-31T10:14:41,1
"Social media needs some guardrails, too. ",Chigrrl1098,2025-03-30T18:47:06,9
"Yes.  The Fairness Doctrine only applied to broadcast media.  That means terrestrial TV and radio, which was and is licensed.  Not print media.  Not cable.  Not satellite.  Not the internet.  A new Fairness Doctrine would have no effect on Fox or podcasters or websites or streaming media or anything else except for the traditional broadcasters who are losing market share.",I405CA,2025-03-30T19:19:06,11
"True.  And even for airwaves, it never was a law.  Just an administrative policy which used to be enforced by FCC.  What if companies who spew lies all day long under the guise of 'news', could be held liable and sued for each lie they tell?  Sued for the damage their propaganda does to the minds of all these gullible, semi-literate trump maggots, and sued for all the damage done from all the false liberal-hating rage bait which trump maggots consume.  Also... illiteracy is the other huge half of this problem.  I recently learned US is 36th in the world in literacy with 54% US adults unable to pass a 6th grade literacy test.  These kids are getting passed on through high school grades while operating at a 5th grade reading level.  And we all see it: trump maggots are dumb as boxes of rocks!  Maggot media preys upon them since they are intellectually defenseless against being brainwashed with right-wing filthy lies about everything.",Tiny_Structure_7,2025-03-30T19:46:25,3
"Yup. And even if the fairness doctrine somehow applied to Fox News it wouldn’t have much impact, since they’d likely already be in compliance. It was always kind of a weak regulation.",elpool2,2025-03-30T20:26:16,2
"Maybe OP meant butterfly effect? With it, perhaps Fox news doesn't become as influential in the 90s, maybe Bush loses, and so on.",BoobyChess,2025-03-31T00:16:54,2
It's a good analogue for what to do in the current situation with new media.  That and counter propaganda.  Republicans should be shameful traitors instead they hide in their eco chamber and call themselves patriots.,Honest-Yesterday-675,2025-03-30T19:53:08,1
Fox News was the beginning of the end…radio too…it snowballed from there.,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-03-31T10:16:30,1
Repealing Sec. 230 would be a good start.,DaveCFb,2025-03-31T16:35:18,1
"The issue is that Trump was elected due to societal issues. Using legislation to try and curb stomp issues caused by culture and society never ends well.  It's cultural issues that caused the majority of Latino men to vote Trump. Cultural issues that caused the majority of White Women to vote Trump. Cultural issues that caused a massive shift to the right for a lot of men. It's cultural issues that caused the majority of Americans to believe the economy was bad (though I truly believe that how we measure economic success is completely flawed), and thus sit out the election due to apathy.  The DNC is not popular enough to put guardrails on social media without it being seen as the left infringing upon the free speech of the right. The DNC, and by extension the left, needs to win on these cultural issues before you can  Gotta fix those cultural issues before you an lead with legislation, unless your not interested in having a united country for much longer, and America is already not in the best place right now without that.",Naticbee,2025-03-30T19:20:42,0
I’m kind of shocked to see a group of people on Reddit who actually understand this concept.,Eric848448,2025-03-30T20:58:36,7
