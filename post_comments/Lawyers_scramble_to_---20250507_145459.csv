Quit calling it deportation!  They're not being afforded due process.  They're not being sent back to their country of origin.  This is kidnapping and human trafficking.,Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-07T14:57:27,325

"This is part of the Imperial Boomerang. Both administrations (Biden & Trump) have been parts of talks to send Gazans to DR Congo or Sudan, and now this is happening with people rounded up on US soil.",bunny_gesserit,2025-05-07T15:56:35,-34

"Who should tell them that? It would have to be someone that has the power to arrest them if they return, and almost all law enforcement are trump loyalists.

"Looks like you're right.   It seems the government never made a deal with Libya. Now one has to wonder why they floated this rumor. Are they trying to find out who's leaking information to the press, trying to hide something, or trying to skirt court orders?

How disconnected from reality do you have to be to wrap this back around to being Biden’s fault?   Exiling leaders of a right-wing extremist organization as part of a peace agreement isn’t remotely this. This is actual human trafficking.,OkVermicelli4534,2025-05-07T16:57:28,28

"Time is a flat circle. (I've shared the comment elsewhere)   ""Utilizing existing buildings allowed the Nazis to quickly set up a functioning camp system without significant construction delays.""   ""The locations of the concentration camps in Poland were strategically chosen to align with Nazi German goals of secrecy and control. Many of the extermination camps, such as Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec, were situated in remote or rural areas, far from major population centers. This made it possible for the Nazis to carry out mass killings without drawing public attention, both within occupied Europe, especially within Germany, and internationally.   The political and social conditions in occupied Poland further contributed to this isolation. Under German occupation, Poland faced severe restrictions on freedom of movement and communication. Any resistance was brutally suppressed, and foreign journalists and observers were largely barred from entering the country. As a result, the full extent of the atrocities committed during the war remained concealed from both the Polish population and the outside world for a significant period.   Moreover, the choice of Poland allowed the Nazis to take advantage of existing anti-Semitic sentiments in certain parts of Europe. While many Poles resisted Nazi oppression, a small number were coerced into cooperating or chose to ignore the atrocities, mainly from fear and the instinct to survive. This combination of geographical remoteness and social fragmentation made Poland an ideal setting for the Nazis to implement their plans with minimal interference.""

"Can you provide a source? All I've been able to find is multiple news outlets reporting that both Libyan governments firmly refute all claims of any agreement to accept people from us, and some unnamed ""government sources"" saying that Libya has agreed to take them.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-08T11:44:27,1
"That law doesn’t stipulate anything about deporting non-Libyans to Libya, or really anything that would apply to the immigrants in question here, though.",scotcetera,2025-05-08T06:35:05,2
"That's being narrow sighted. There were protests and campaigns to call lawmakers to block the Laken Riley Act specifically because informed people knew it would lead to further deportations without due process. Slotkin and Peters in Michigan received harsh pushback because it bolstered the Right. Trump is the worst but it was also enabled by lack of any spine on the ""opposing"" side.",bunny_gesserit,2025-05-08T08:35:08,1

"It is possible to think the vast majority of the US governing body and society is cooked, and Trump is the ultimate manifestation. The Democrats are supposed to put up a fight on behalf of us who aren't white supremacist, genocidal, monsters, but they aren't establishing that sentiment.",bunny_gesserit,2025-05-08T08:47:27,1

"I can't speak for Bunny, but they do bring up some good points.   Trump doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's not like America had a long line of lovely, kind politicians who did the right thing for humanity and provided a shining example of how to govern and then he showed up. Yes, he is worse than any Democrat. He is worse than any prior president. He is worse than damn near every Republican. BUT he only got where he is because of the failures of *everyone* before him. If Dems could have saved things or changed the course we're on, they could have done it a long fucking time ago.   I'm 1000% anti-trump & anti-fascist but the Dems aren't Jesus. America didn't just move away from their perfection and that's why we're here. They fucked us coming and going and always have, just on a smaller scale than what Trump is doing now. If they hadn't insisted on putting Biden up for reelection and instead chosen a candidate that ANYONE actually wanted, we might not have lost the election and gotten into this mess. There's plenty of blame to go around.   Obama was great at a lot of things and did a lot of good, but he did bad shit too. He bombed a *lot* of brown people. Biden did some good, but he deported the shit out of people too. Trump is one of the most vile humans ever to exist, BUT he couldn't be where he is and do what he's doing were it not for all the doors that were opened before he showed up.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-08T12:03:06,2
"Oh, Democrats certainly have their share of issues; weakness and inaction chiefly among them. But the ""both sides are the same"" attempts are blatantly shallow and stupid. For one, because they're trying to falsely equivocate the right's direct and intentional malice to Democratic Party inaction.   Certainly some questionable morality among both parties, but ""both sides are the same"" is kind of like saying the person who failed to lock the door is the same level of evil as the person who strolled through said unlocked door and murdered someone.   From everything I've seen, the goal of ""both sides"" attempts is largely to make Republicans and Trump seem less bad by trying to make the Democrats seem as evil as they are. They never come across as genuine or well thought out.",scotcetera,2025-05-08T12:12:38,1
"I don't disagree with any of that. The sides are definitely not the same. But I didn't see anywhere that Bunny suggested as much. They mentioned that both sides played a part, but I didn't take away that they were suggesting that both sides were the same or shared equal blame.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-08T12:16:16,1
"Hence why I ask ""both sides"" folks who is more at fault. That's usually when I most clearly see how disingenuous their narratives are; they're usually hard up to avoid acknowledging that the right is chiefly to blame, because they actually took the actions.",scotcetera,2025-05-08T12:20:06,2
