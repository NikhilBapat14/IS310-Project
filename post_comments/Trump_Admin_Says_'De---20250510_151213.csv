The US *never* punishes its enforcement agents or soldiers for following orders, as a policy, to the point it has a law on the books that requires the president to invade The Hague if any US citizen is brought there on war crime charges without the US' permission.

"Hey! It's my old friend from an unfinished ""taxation is theft"" discussion back again with another hot take.  When you say ""people who shouldn't be here,"" can you be more specific? Are you referring to the democratically elected congresspeople being targeted here? Not only are they citizens, they're citizens a majority of their constituency believed best represented their interests on the national stage. While every one of them may not be an exemplary person, they are inexorably Americans and cannot be considered ""someone who shouldn't be here.""  Quite frankly, there isn't a threshold for who ""should"" be in America other than who can get here. Good or bad, the role of America (at least by its founding documents) is to be a place where anyone can turn up and make something of themselves. We've been working for 250 years against oligarchy and authoritarianism to extend that reality to more and more people. We've done a middling job, but the arc of the universe once bent nominally towards justice.   And now we backslide while people champion a wanton disregard for the rule of law and somehow fail to imagine the row of dominoes that will inevitably fall into something they love and destroy it.   The ""leopards eating faces"" thing is getting really played out, but the conflagration of people twisting themselves into cognitively dissonant knots trying to support a morally bankrupt administration keep bringing the idea back to the table.   (As an aside: if taxation is theft, how do you think Trump is going to pay for the mass deportations? Take up a general fund from his oligarch friends? Or are you cool with taxation when it funds the kind of evil that lets the truly unexceptional have more than they deserve by stealing it from people of different genders and ethnicities?)",Angstrom_Wither,2025-05-10T15:33:18,1
