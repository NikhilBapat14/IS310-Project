Why do I have a feeling this is nothing but a ploy to crack down on free speech?,Kroptokinsloaf,2025-05-03T08:28:23,29
"From the article:  >“This legislation will allow today’s kids to be kids again,” Patterson told lawmakers on Tuesday, calling this bill ""one of the most important pieces of legislation” he has carried.  I live in Texas where several other persons have complained to me that kids are no longer riding their bikes in their neighborhoods or swimming in local outdoor pools.   Of course, they blame social media.  I tell these fools that increased number of days over 100° means that no sane parent allows their kids to risk heat illnesses for bike riding or swimming.  Sure.  Today's kids are not being kids like my older generation was able to do when we were children.  Banning social media will not magically fix the reasons for this.  That would require Republican idiots like Patterson to understand how Climate Change is impacting even the lifestyles of children.",ResidentKelpien,2025-05-03T08:58:36,18

Even the conservatives sub is against this. It’s clearly overreach. While I think that generally social media is not great for kids it does have some benefits and the decision should be left to teens and their parents. ,Select_Ad_976,2025-05-03T12:11:33,7

"I live in Texas, but have a VPN. Probably going to get really annoying. For example Discord's new system that they rolled out in Australia. Having to prove my age to an AI sounds really dystopian and trolls can easily activate the system. If this keeps going it may become federal law at some point where everyone in the US has to use ID.me.   Meanwhile kids will always figure a way around it.   Will be curious to see how *social media is defined once they agree on a final version of the SCOPE Act, or as I like to call it: the s-COPE Act.",krozarEQ,2025-05-03T11:36:35,3

"It would be even better if they ban adults from it.     I'm not on any social media, unless you count topic based discussion forums like Reddit, which I don't consider social media.    Social media has done a great deal to dumb down all of our national conversations, and to silo people in their own little ideological universes.  Here's a great article from the Atlantic on this topic: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T08:38:39,3

"How are MAGA algorithms going to groom kids without this.      This is happening in Australia too, but it’s under 16’s there and will take effect within a year.      Something in the water .. social media’s advantages are far outweighed by their disadvantages for the young.       Maybe Stranger Things becomes real and we start seeing kids playing out in the streets again, return of the hula hoop? No, too dangerious, health and safety reasons.   Not looking at devices telling them who they should hate, who hates them, and what totally unrealistic images they have to live up to.  It’s just occurred, how are social media Influencer’s going to influence the young. This would be like a end of dinosaurs event for them.  So tragic \[tears emoji\]",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-03T08:27:37,0

When I was a kid everyone was complaining that kids had too much freedom and that it was dangerous out there. Latchkey Kid was a derogatory remark levied against the children of working parents.  I doubt that'll change.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-03T09:11:57,10
"As the saying goes, two things can be true at once. Rising temperatures keep more and more kids from outdoor play: this is a genuine problem. But I think by now it's indisputable that most of us have been damaged by the digital alterworld that often outcompetes embodied reality for our time and attention, and children are perhaps the most damaged of all. ",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-03T10:44:09,2

Bingo. Too many young people think Palestinians are human because of TikTok. Can’t get the TikTok ban to stick? Just ban kids from using it instead.,codyashi_maru,2025-05-03T18:48:13,3
"I'm not sure its benefits outweigh its disadvantages. The toxic algorithms, turning many boys into female haters, girls constantly trying to live up to idealized impossible images. Politicizing them early into divisions and hatred. Having relationships with their screens which often denigrate relationships and the ability to communicate in 'real life'.   Yes, I agree there are definitely advantages, but are they really that overpowering compared in the battle of pros and cons though?",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-04T07:15:09,1
"Not going to argue one way or another on social media pros and cons, except to say have you tried a month without social media just for the comparison?  I stepped the divide in youth of not having it then having it as a comparison with memory to compare.

Gen Alpha is leaning conservative.  > Minors....who know and understand technology/social media  There's some reports that kids aren't even able to use computers these days other than mobile phones.  Not sure where this notion that only kids know how to use technology.  It's adults that are building the technology.,box-cable,2025-05-03T08:39:17,6
"I mean, that's a cute fear tactic but at the end of the day (according to the numbers) all carrying an addictive predatory nightmare around in their pockets has done for children is make them dumber and addicted to predatory billionaire owned algorithms (or straight up gambling).  The problem with your narrative is that quality of life metrics pretty overwhelmingly went *down* with the advent of the smartphone/social media. They're not net positives. They're not bastions of free speech. They're predatory billionaire owned nightmares that are mostly used for social engineering and harvesting your personal data.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-05-03T20:44:37,1

"I mean, since we're being honest here... it's not everyone else's responsibility to monitor everyone else's kids. Period.      Parents needs to learn about parental controls on the electronic devices, monitor their kids' activities better, and maybe society at large should re-think giving all these very young kids internet connected cameras. That would solve pretty much most of it without having to infringe on everyone else's privacy and rights. Let's not ruin the internet and hold it to some crazy standard because they can't take responsibility for their own kids.",Heximate,2025-05-05T10:50:40,1
"For some kids, the benefits do outweigh the cons.  I highly recommend the book “behind their screens” written by social scientists. A lot of kids don’t benefit and are harmed by it - parents need to talk to their kids more about social media, how to use it, and know about what voices are getting to their kids. Some kids though it provides their only positive social interactions, gives them a support system (which is super important if you don’t have one at home), helps them stay connected to their friends, etc.   Outright banning it is dumb - it’s just as bad as book banning in my opinion. It’s limiting knowledge and experience. Kids will find away around it anyway and they’ll do it with nobody watching so it’s easier for them to view the negative content. ",Select_Ad_976,2025-05-04T08:16:38,2

"Well, I like the discussion and will check the book out. Prohibition never did work well in America. Alcohol prohibition was different in so many ways, but the result was criminal enterprises stepping in and of course it was mainly adults involved then, whereas this could mean more criminal group enterprises and  far less regulation for one of the most vulnerable age groups for exploitiation including by perverts.    I am interested in what Australia's experiement will bring though.  Again, a completely different area, but their gun reforms and gun 'prohibition' after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre led to an incredibly safer country, not just for gun homicides but gun suicides.  I don't have the brain power bandwidth to say if it will be a success or disaster in Australia, but I am interested in how it goes to see which it is.",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-04T08:31:29,2

"Yeah, it is weird that I have this view about social media but am all for a gun ban. I feel like it’s probably because a gun can kill someone and there is no doubt it’s the gun whereas social media could lead to deaths but no way to prove it’s the sole reason? I’ll have to think about this.   (I do think it’s interesting the party that wants family values are the ones saying - we can’t control what our kids do so we want the government to do it.)",Select_Ad_976,2025-05-04T09:21:26,2
"That is the worrying part that it's a move by Republicans in Texas, especially as they've benefitted so much off divisive algorithms and that they want govt involvement like you say.  Labour in Australia just won, beating the Liberal Party there (designed to confuse us as the Liberals there are actually the Conservative party equivalent). The Canadian election was defenitely an anti-Trump one, I don't know enough about Australia.        I'm too lazy on this Sunday to check who actually proposed the under 16 ban in Aus. I'm going to make a Dunning Kruger guess that it was some cross-party compromise for something so big to pass. When I have some coffee I may look it up!   I don't mind being proven wrong re Aus, they're a different type of society, but I hope that wanting to see what will happen doesn't end in very negative things there if I'm way wrong.",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-04T09:43:24,2
