"The ancient Greeks thought hubris was among the ugliest of human qualities.   They even invented a god whose sole job it was to punish hubris, Nemesis.

"The American people can stop him - but not if they wait around wondering if we are in a Dictatorship yet. If our legislators see the people standing up, it will give them the backbone they need. At least put the fear of the midterm in their guts.   >The electoral road to breakdown is dangerously deceptive. With a classic coup d‚Äô√©tat, as in Pinochet‚Äôs Chile, the death of a democracy is immediate and evident to all. The presidential palace burns. The president is killed, imprisoned, or shipped off into exile. The constitution is suspended or scrapped.   >On the electoral road, none of these things happen. There are no tanks in the streets. Constitutions and other nominally democratic institutions remain in place. People still vote. Elected autocrats maintain a veneer of democracy while eviscerating its substance.   >Many government efforts to subvert democracy are ‚Äúlegal,‚Äù in the sense that they are approved by the legislature or accepted by the courts. They may even be portrayed as efforts to improve democracy‚Äîmaking the judiciary more efficient, combating corruption, or cleaning up the electoral process. Newspapers still publish but are bought off or bullied into self-censorship. Citizens continue to criticize the government but often find themselves facing tax or other legal troubles.   >This sows public confusion. People do not immediately realize what is happening. Many continue to believe they are living under a democracy. In 2011, when a Latinobar√≥metro survey asked Venezuelans to rate their own country from 1 (‚Äúnot at all democratic‚Äù) to 10 (‚Äúcompletely democratic‚Äù), 51 percent of respondents gave their country a score of 8 or higher.  >Because there is no single moment‚Äîno coup, declaration of martial law, or suspension of the constitution‚Äîin which the regime obviously ‚Äúcrosses the line‚Äù into dictatorship, nothing may set off society‚Äôs alarm bells. Those who denounce government abuse may be dismissed as exaggerating or crying wolf.   >Democracy‚Äôs erosion is, for many, almost imperceptible.   ~Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point By Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt",SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T06:15:22,24
