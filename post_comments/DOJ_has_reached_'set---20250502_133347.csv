"Why? As a former MP (I believe) she was fully aware her actions were not legal. Who climbs through a broken door window at gunpoint and thinks they are in the right? Her family deserves nothing.  Edit: >The suit alleged Lt. Michael Byrd, the officer shot Babbitt, had negligently discharged his firearm and failed to warn Babbitt or de-escalate the situation.  Um, I watched it on live stream. It was not a negligent discharge of the weapon. She was warned not to climb through and what the consequence would be. At least twice.
