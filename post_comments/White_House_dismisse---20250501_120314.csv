"Remember, these days you write a business plan with an exit strategy, usually selling to a larger corporation or private equity firms, in place.  You aren’t supposed to start a small business to build something for yourself anymore. You’re supposed to start a small business, to build something you’ll sell to the rich.   They don’t want us to own anything.",milehighmagpie,2025-05-01T23:01:53,2
"Small biz owner here. We do things right - pay our employees above market rates, pay 100% of healthcare, maternity and paternity leave. What does that mean for us though? Less cash flow - not enough money for the space or the inventory we would have needed to secure before tariffs hit. In just a few months our competitors who could stockpile inventory or are using dodgey import practices will most likely wipe us out.   It’s heartbreaking. We were able to grow this company and take care of our employees throughout the entire pandemic. We thought for sure if we could make it through Covid we could make it through this.   Each day that seems less likely. It’s heartbreaking.   And no our products aren’t available in the US and they never could be due to technical constraints.  Worst part we are B2B and supply to other small businesses. We go, they go. The ripple effects will be massive and that’s just in our industry.   And before anyone brings up leopards - we all voted Harris even though we are in a sea of red.",Gonnagremlin,2025-05-01T12:55:15,6
