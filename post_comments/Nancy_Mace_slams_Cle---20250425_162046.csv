Automatic downvote for fox news propaganda.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-25T16:22:58,37
Sure.   Science says that gender dysphoria is best treated through gender affirming care through the patient's self-perceived gender.,Motodoso,2025-04-25T16:25:45,54

Nancy Mace is obsessed with transgender people. I'm starting to suspect she's mentally ill.,HarwellDekatron,2025-04-25T16:45:07,12
"On the topic of science... shit get's weird. Extremely weird.  Genetics, then chemicals, hormones, environment, even stuff you cannot possibly understand.  Science isn't just ""A"" or ""B"". It runs the whole gambit.  Sometimes there's an extra X or Y or perhaps a certain gene is over expressed or under expressed, or one is over and another is over, but the end result is something completely unexpected.  Science is awesome.",HonoredPeople,2025-04-25T16:25:27,19
Republicans and their “science” lmao  Someone posted this recently:  [How Democrats and Republicans cite science: study reveals stark differences](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01311-9),BigDaddyBain,2025-04-25T16:44:31,7

She doesn’t even follow the science,missingpineapples,2025-04-25T16:25:47,6
"MAGA and their politicians are on the low side of the IQ bell curve. According to my observations, not science. It would not surprise me, judging by MAGA's actions and rhetoric, if a scientific study of that population were to produce those results. Woke ideology seems to encompass everything that isn't on the Stormfront side of the GOP. (I mean the nazi side.)",eric_ts,2025-04-25T16:32:11,7

"What exactly is she trying to gain from going full MAGAt? Does she think Trump will support her for Gov. of South Carolina, is she just trying too hard to cover up late-bloomer queerness, or...?",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-25T16:44:53,3
Oh *now* she wants to follow “science”,misterchainsaw,2025-04-25T16:46:37,3
Copy Pasta Inbound > quick linguistic history lesson. the term “woke” originates from african american communities to describe being “awake and aware” of the current sociopolitical climate. this term has been used since at least the 1930s. it wasnt until 2014 during the ferguson protests that the term entered the wider vernacular. mainly as a result of black twitter. and as is common with many things coined by the black community. it was repeated and commercialized to death to the point where now most people only using it mockingly. including people on the left. the point is. “woke” is not a bad word. the alt right wants it to be one.,StanDaMan1,2025-04-25T17:50:17,3

Fox news lies to its audience and Nancy Mace stole thousands of tax dollars to clean her multimillion dollar town house she was renting out on VRBO. Fk out of here scammers,Phynx88,2025-04-25T17:00:09,1
"Yeah I really don’t give a shit what this fascist idiot has to say about anything. I’m sure it’ll be wrong and incredibly stupid, just like the rest of the liquid feces that comes out of her mouth. Fuck you Nancy, nobody likes you.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-04-25T17:24:02,1

There may be something to that.,HarwellDekatron,2025-04-25T16:57:49,1
"""Their Science!"" which is akin to saying ""Their God!"", which becomes their absolute validation for ""Their viewpoint"".  They use whatever it takes to enforce their beliefs on others.  Like you said, I also doubt their understanding of ""Science"" or even ""God"".",HonoredPeople,2025-04-25T16:39:55,7
