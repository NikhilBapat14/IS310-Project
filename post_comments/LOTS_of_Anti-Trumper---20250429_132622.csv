"""In a shocking  setback for Trump, a liberal government has surprisingly replaced a liberal government in Canada"".",AppState1981,2025-04-29T14:13:27,12
"I'm not a never-Trumper. I voted for the man and would never have done otherwise, but the premise of the article is deliberately obtuse. Any rational Canadian who values their country's sovereignty would be justifiably alarmed at Trump's repeated insistence that Canada should become the 51st state.  Most American conservatives are fiercely patriotic and nationalistic (I know I am). And most would be appalled if they were put in the position of patriotic Canadians trying to comprehend Trump's repeated desires to usurp Canada's independence. Anyone who insists Trump had nothing to do with the outcome of Canada's election....or  conversely, that Canadian's are ridiculous for having concerns over Trump's statements and reflecting those concerns in the voting booth....is just as myopic as those suffering from TDS and who hate everything Trump does.  I despise Carney and the Liberals. I wish to God they had gone down in defeat. And I'm willing to acknowledge exactly why that didn't happen.  Trump is not the Messiah. He's done some incredibly good things (border security)....and some very bad things (needlessly alienating US allies by attacking their sovereignty). Why can't we admit as much? Are we as ideologically programmed as our opponents on the left that we can't see what's in front of our faces?",Vessarionovich,2025-04-30T07:11:40,4
"I mean, they would have done so with or without Trump. Conservatives were not going to win a majority and the liberals would have still created the government with lefties.   In any case, Poli showed his true colors and folded. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-03T08:51:04,1
