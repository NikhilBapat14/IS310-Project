"Ah yes, because nothing says 'Make America Great Again' like forcing American businesses to pay a 125% tariff just to order PCBs. It's like trying to build a tech business in a developing country, except we get the patriotic privilege of being charged like a third-world importer. Want to order a batch of PCBs for your innovative product? That'll be an extra $177 in tariffs for a $169 order. Scale up? Fantastic, that'll now cost you $334. And don’t forget the bonus ‘Customs Fee’ because nothing says 'innovation economy' like being taxed into oblivion just to keep your business running.  Thanks to these tariffs, I now get to experience the thrill of building American tech... with the pricing pain of a banana republic.",prajwas2004,2025-05-08T10:29:25,9
"Yeah. As opposed to the 50k investment in startups that Harris was pitching, it sucks...especially when you consider that Harris' plan would have been more effective in stimulating domestic production, which is what Trump is claiming his reasoning is.",theombudsmen,2025-05-08T10:36:29,9

"I own a toy store. The industry is in a total panic, but, ya know, since we are toy stores, we are just posting normal happy fun times on our socials. IT IS NOT NORMAL HAPPY FUN TIMES HERE. I usually have 5o to 6 orders out there at any given time. Now I have zero and sales have already taken a serious hit.  These are toys with HQs and sales reps and offices in the US and produced in China. These are not ""chinese junk"" which seems to be the new thing the MAGAs have attached to. These are big name brands that people trust here.  I am stocked up for...a little while depending on the item but no new toys = bored customers who don't come back eventually. Freshening up the selection is REALLY important.  Price hikes from my suppliers started mid April and are ramping up through July. Most are 5 to 30%, so not 145% at this point, but significant. I haven't raised any prices in store yet.  I do order a few brands from places that are not China, but 80% of toys come from China. I carry a couple Made in America brands. Now toy companies are working through their warehoused stock. After that, nobody knows what to do. Order more toys, for what customers? Will peop;e have jobs and money to pay for them? Christmas? Um...normally I prepare all year for Christmas, budgeting, ordering, preordering. All that is at a screeching absolute halt right now.  People saying ""you need to pivot"" bro...pivot to what??? I can't pivot an entire industry out of China. I am a little 1 person toy shop. Trump could do literally anything at any given moment, he could put huge tariffs on Thailand or Sweden or who knows what. Producers are not going to produce toys in America just because Trump has suddenly made some rash decision he could change at any time if he gets what he wants from some other country (look what Vietnam gave him!)  Let's not forget Trump got the ability to make all these tariffs by declaring a fentanyl crisis and congress could end this emergency at any time as far as I know.",ToysForJoy,2025-05-08T14:50:21,4
You don’t get to be the world’s most elevated conman by caring about other people’s businesses.  “Businessmen” (especially Trump and Elon) are bad at running the government.,LuvKrahft,2025-05-08T10:50:46,1

"Hang in there. It's incredibly tough when factors like thoughtless ridiculous tariffs disrupt your business, especially in an industry that thrives on variety and fresh products. You're clearly doing your best to keep your store running and your customers happy.  Sometimes, all we can do is weather the storm, and you’re not alone in this struggle.",prajwas2004,2025-05-09T01:41:13,1
"Thanks a lot! I know a lot of people are out here struggling under these tariffs. I hope somehow people find a way through, from trucking to shipping to warehousing to retail and services, it's spooky times.",ToysForJoy,2025-05-09T10:33:11,1
