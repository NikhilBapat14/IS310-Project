I knew Fetterman before the stroke. I used to run in the same political circles as him. I got downvoted like hell on this very sub for telling people to vote for Connor Lamb and sharing this one important tidbit of wisdom: Fetterman was never a progressive.   He is a political opportunist. Always has been. You know that bullshit story he tells about living in a church basement? Conveniently leaves out that he is a nepo baby and church in question was bought by his father and basement in question was converted into a luxury home.   Fetterman is the ultimate failure of progressives and a reflection of how shallow they can be. Sinema at least hid who she was. Fetterman was always hiding in plain sight. But progressives could not see past the blue jeans and performative hanging of the rainbow flag. They did not want to see beyond that. He was a big guy in a hoody who said “fuck.” And they ate it right up. And are now surprised that he’s who he always was.,MattTheSmithers,2025-05-08T06:17:03,222

Biden was a fairly competent administration and I’d argue, he handled it well, surprised me on some fronts too.

"I'm afraid I have to move on to 'saner pastures'.  This is sounding more like a Trumpy ""accept what I say because I said it"" than an intelligent argument based upon demonstrable facts (and no I don't call ""an apology from AOC"" proof positive of anything - nor would any sane politician, much less random chat participant).  I also noticed that you continue to disregard the implications of Lamb having lost to Fetterman by 30pts.  That smells of delusion.  I've already given this 'discussion' more time than it deserves.  Sorry you failed to convince, but recommend you try factual evidence in future.  We Dems are natural cynics: you know, sticklers for ""fact-based"" stuff...",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T11:15:51,0
"What? He obviously lost by 30 points. Those are the results. You’re trying to reframe the original conversation because you had no clue what we were talking about and had to google the election and read a salon article to figure it out.   Oh yeah, then reframe what is being said as merely only talking about the final result and ignore everything else said because you are sensitive about your low level of knowledge.",Brett__Bretterson,2025-05-08T12:07:31,1
