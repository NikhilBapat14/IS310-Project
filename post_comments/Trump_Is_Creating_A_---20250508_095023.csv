"From reporter Dave Jamieson:  If you’re loyal to President Donald Trump and his democracy-testing agenda, then you just might land a job in the Trump administration. But if you’re extremely loyal, then you might land three or even four.  Last week, the president tapped Secretary of State Marco Rubio to serve at least temporarily as his new national security adviser, after exiling Mike Waltz of Signal-gate fame to New York City as his new ambassador to the United Nations, pending Senate confirmation. Rubio will remain in his full-time, Senate-confirmed role as the president’s chief foreign affairs adviser while also managing our national security.  But Rubio also has two other side gigs, at least on paper. He's also in charge of the National Archives and Records Administration and U.S. AID.  And he's not the only one juggling jobs. Several other officials also have been plucked for multiple roles, raising the question of how they could possibly run different departments simultaneously. Heading up just one federal agency is a massive undertaking.

Rubio is just going to do all the work. No more new jobs.,now_error_later,2025-05-08T11:19:42,1
Nobody knows merit like Cheeto! Absolutely none of these people getting hired are based on DEI at all! They are all more than qualified and their merit alone is why they are being selected. If I could only laugh through this app. Hahahahahahahhahaa!!!,tacs97,2025-05-08T12:43:46,1
