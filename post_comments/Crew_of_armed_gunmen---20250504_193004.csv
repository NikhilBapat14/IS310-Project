"Three men, in their late teens to early 20s, were seen in photos carrying handguns and pointing them at the vehicle.  They wonâ€™t get far, there is enough facial recognition to develop the whole face, plus the car, plus DNA, they are toast and stupid! The register they took has surveillance devices and other tracking and prevention tools attached!  However, loomis has gun ports, why didnâ€™t they use them? Youâ€™re in a truck designed to withstand such an assault.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T21:08:46,12

"Well yeah, broad daylight, never see armored truck services after sunset. They usually come in during lunch-time.  And I hope they get fired. They had one job to do.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T23:31:47,1
Probably because they arenâ€™t allowed to. Donâ€™t want to hurt a choir member or a father.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-04T21:51:37,19
HEAT? Were they filming ðŸŽ¥ the sequel?,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T21:05:39,1
This is probably the answer. These armored trucks present themselves as hard targets but they probably have as much authorization to use force as a mall cop.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-05T00:28:13,10
