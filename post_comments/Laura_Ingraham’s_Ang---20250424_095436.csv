"Excerpts:  The endgame is to dispense with due process for migrants entirely. Ingraham’s segment shows how MAGA will build this case: Migrants are “illegal alien gangbangers” simply because Trump declares them so. That unlocks Trump’s power to declare thousands or millions of migrants to be dangerous criminals by definition. Lawful processes will not remove the dangerous criminals fast enough; therefore let’s dispense with those processes to the greatest extent possible.  We’re now seeing an effort to erect a new legal order in which migrants simply cannot contest their designated status as dangerous criminals in any sense, which in turn makes the leader’s declaration of that status by fiat unalterable and supreme. To use Trump’s language, he is “entitled” to simply decree untold numbers of migrants to be contaminants sapping our national renewal—which is basically what “MS-13” has come to mean—making them subject to expulsion outside of any legal constraints.  Democrats need to get in there and disrupt these declarations-by-fiat, and expose the lawlessness at their core, wherever possible.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-24T09:54:57,52

Because it has been often said and repeated doesn't mean we can turn away from constantly educating our fellow Americans. Democracy requires eternal vigilance.  ![gif](giphy|U6Qzze3Mt90Ig),D-R-AZ,2025-04-24T11:11:21,18

I figure that's what they plan to do with inmates in the for-profit prison system; rent them out as unpayed day labor. Wouldn't be the first time.,MK5,2025-04-24T19:59:38,6
