"*“The President is considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more to revert from 37% to the pre-2017 39.6%. This will help pay for massive middle and working-class tax cuts, and protect Medicaid,” a source familiar with the President’s thinking said.*  Very unpopular, needless to say, with many GOP reps.",fxkatt,2025-05-08T14:58:25,4

"Part of be thinks this might be symbolic because of the pushback he’s getting on tariffs from the lower class. Just more extortion, but would be nice to see the billionaires on the business end of it for once.",Most_Technology557,2025-05-08T17:47:27,1
I am pretty sure he is pandering and will not do. It will come up with some distraction while a midnight deal is made.,BagIndependent4811,2025-05-09T11:12:26,1
Because Trump knows Congress will never do that.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-08T15:43:10,1
Haha wtf..    What is this a distraction for..,Bass_MN,2025-05-08T17:45:39,1
He means rich democrats….  There is a distinction there.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-08T15:28:10,0
"It is.  Thinking he's wanting to show his base some kinda warmth or respect, while he robs the bank.  Trump is always lying. He cannot help himself. So, when he says, ""more taxes for the rich"", it comes off as con man like.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-08T14:55:55,7

Much of  wealth for the top millionaires and billionaires are from unrealized gains.  This untaxed wealth can be borrowed against at a low interest rate (much lower than a tax rate).  What is really needed is a property tax for the top 1%.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-08T15:34:20,2

Can’t they be a little more targeted than that? Wasn’t that the point of all that data DOGE stole?  Can’t they just raise taxes on lesbian soccer moms and people who donate to food banks and itemized their deductions or two time Obama voters (just for examples).,specqq,2025-05-08T14:52:52,0
except they can just rent houses instead of buying them with cheap/free loans from the bank,The_Starving_Autist,2025-05-08T15:57:33,1
the plan i saw was from last month and it was the one proposed by the R in congress,Tornado_Tax_Anal,2025-05-08T15:21:49,1
No they can't.  The R tax plan that was released would raise my taxes my like 4K per year. and lower them on high earners and low wage earners. basically Fing the middle class as hard as they can.  Trump already raised my taxes by like 2K last time he was in office. Funny how R keep raising my taxes... and claim to be 'low tax' party.,Tornado_Tax_Anal,2025-05-08T14:53:35,1
