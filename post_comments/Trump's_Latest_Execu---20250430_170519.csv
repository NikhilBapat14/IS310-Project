Hey does anyone else remember that brief moment back in 2020 when it seemed like the country was learning something about justice and police accountability? What an idiot i must have been to think we as a people could learn a lesson like that.,Tompthwy,2025-04-30T17:22:31,21
"From reporter Rajul Punjabi-Johnson:  This past Monday, the White House dropped yet another executive order, and this one includes a directive to the Department of Justice to defend and support local police who face liabilities on the job. That “support” includes financially backing law enforcement agencies and officers accused of misconduct.  If you’re feeling particularly strong-stomached today, go ahead and read the [whole executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/), which is earnestly titled “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens.”  There’s a lot to be worried about in the executive order. Let's break it down.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/  This EO: - militarizes local police - extends power to military to act as police - extends this power to citizen militias or groups - provides legal immunity to all of the above,m0stlydead,2025-05-01T04:08:29,4
"Such a fluff piece.   The article never actually makes the case for it making police  less accountable. While I don't like the Executive Order, this piece focused on providing legal services in the event of litigation against police. Representation should be a right enjoyed by all parties in our legal system and not one to be discounted.",gunsandgardening,2025-04-30T17:44:27,-5
I’d like to hear more about “protecting innocent citizens””:     [**U.S.-citizen family 'traumatized' after ICE raided their Oklahoma home in search of someone else**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-citizen-family-traumatized-ice-raid-rcna203700),BeowulfShaeffer,2025-04-30T18:11:41,2
Did you read this EO?  It is a *lot* more than that.,m0stlydead,2025-05-01T04:06:40,2
I did. I was addressing a specific part of the EO.,gunsandgardening,2025-05-01T05:29:12,0
"I understand now, thank you.  However - I wouldn’t want my taxes paying for the legal representation for the people who just killed a family member or burned down my house, would you?  They have *less* rightful claim to tax paid legal representation than their victims have.   None of these EOs are designed to protect American citizens, they’re all designed to oppress anyone and everyone.",m0stlydead,2025-05-01T07:14:50,2
