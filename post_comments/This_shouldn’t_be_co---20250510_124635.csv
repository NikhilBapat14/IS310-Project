Some parts of Europe are finally waking up from their long deluded sleep but I fear that it's too late for most of them.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-10T16:57:12,10

"Shit like this is exactly why western countries shouldn't let anyone from the Middle East immigrate. They don't assimilate, actively hate westerners, and just create problems with the local populace.",Suspicious-Sound-249,2025-05-10T16:26:33,10
"Hold the line, conservatives. Without the media on their side, they would cease to exist. We would actually get stuff done and stop fearing hit-pieces.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-10T14:59:18,15
"I disagree. Primarily because we've seen how the left interprets hate and intolerance. A law like that would need very specific guidelines, like a direct call to violence.",Haust,2025-05-10T15:50:31,6
Italy is probably the only other country in the world I’d consider living in and it’s because their PM is by far the most grounded in reality leader in all of Europe,TheYoungLung,2025-05-10T18:22:04,1
So are we now pro-hate speech laws? How about they just deport him because anyone named “Zulfiqar” does not belong in Italy.,Total_Decision123,2025-05-10T15:11:06,3

"In many cases, these kinds of radical ideologies are banned in their home countries. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and several other Muslim countries have bans on these kinds of radicalism. Because we have freedom of speech, the worst radicals from foreign countries can move to the west and preach whatever they want with no consequences.",SharingDNAResults,2025-05-10T13:57:59,113
They want to spread their own ideals into places that normally reject them. World dominance is a core value in Islam.,theboss2461,2025-05-10T13:50:04,183
They did not move there with the idea of respecting local customs and traditions. They spread the same culture and hatred they ran away from. I really don't understand why they insist on living in a place they hate everything about.  It's a perfect way to destabilize a country if you ask me. Belarus has been doing it for years by bringing in immigant workers and pushing them towards the Polish border.,TypicalWisdom,2025-05-10T14:09:04,53
"Islam is a religion of conquest. To be fair, in previous centuries many religions had wars of conquest, but in the 21st century Islam is the sole major religion that continues that ideology.",Normal_Saline_,2025-05-10T14:48:47,51
They’ve been spreading this hate for 1400 years.  It will never end. Countries need to smarten up and not let scum like this infest their country.,AlanSmithee23,2025-05-10T14:37:41,37
"They want the best of both worlds, nice comfy place to live while being able to spread their hateful views. Greedy, hateful people exist. I truly feel bad for the UK because their govt is backasswards.",Roudyrepublican,2025-05-10T15:57:14,7
Because they like the benefits that aren't offered in their shithole of a country.,Uller85,2025-05-10T14:45:52,14
Ask liberals why they do it. The run from places like CA and NY and then they start working to change laws to what they left.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-10T14:48:08,12
But that's the way Islam spreads.,dankhorse25,2025-05-10T15:45:50,4

They like this thread as they like hate speech laws.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-10T16:40:24,4
"You’re right, but we’re talking about a jihadist openly calling for a religious ethno-war against the local population. This is someone who has influence over thousands of people who behave that way. I think it goes beyond even the realm of free speech.",TypicalWisdom,2025-05-10T17:51:07,2
Why not? The only reason he doesn’t belong there is because of his intolerant views.,spamisqualityfood,2025-05-10T15:41:13,9
"Free speech is mostly protected. But threats of violence and terrorism aren't protected. Nor is slander and libel because all of those can land a person in hot water, but the left likes to protect people who say and do those things.",DeathTheSoulReaper,2025-05-10T17:29:18,9
">World dominance is a core value in Islam.  Which is why the Crusades happened in the first place, although they try to revise that as Christian aggression.",Gunsofglory,2025-05-10T14:48:34,109
"Looking at how they live, act and view the world/other people in general it's pretty safe to say they never left the middle ages in mindset.",A_Hatless_Casual,2025-05-10T17:04:18,13
Are you a liberal?  “He doesn’t belong because of his intolerant views”   Lol. Lmao even. And he doesn’t belong because he is not Italian. It’s very simple,Total_Decision123,2025-05-10T15:53:18,1
I can probably think of a few more reasons.,Best-Guava1285,2025-05-10T17:30:31,0
"so were the numerous conquests against people of my faith, nasty people indeed",Nerftuco,2025-05-10T16:00:21,28

"This guy is probably preaching death to anyone who isn’t Muslim, and you think that’s ok?",spamisqualityfood,2025-05-10T17:51:16,2
"You're accusing people of being pro-censorship while you preach pro-racism.   Dunno mate, at least the others have a valid point and judge a person on the content of their character, which is calls to violence, instead of someone not belonging because they don't have the right genetic makeup",Dutchtdk,2025-05-10T17:58:23,1
"You have to be an undercover leftist trying to make conservatives look bad lmao, there’s no way it could be anything else.",spamisqualityfood,2025-05-10T17:52:21,2
