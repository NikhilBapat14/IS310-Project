Stores and manufacturers are making decisions now about holiday lineups. It's pretty bleak.  Trump has already ruined Christmas.,ZebTheFourth,2025-05-01T14:10:24,31
Its too late. Damage is already done. Trades between nations have already changed. Sure he could reduce the damage if he admitted he was wrong but we know that won't happen.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-01T14:12:04,25
It may happen for a while even if he does. It would take time for shipments to resume and get to the US.,pensivegargoyle,2025-05-01T14:04:19,12
"Empty shelves are inevitable already.  We just have 2-6 weeks until it REALLY hits because retailers front loaded a bit more inventory in Feb-March before liberation day... shipping is already down, and will be a trickle by the end of May.  People should be stocking up on dry goods staples, because this is going to get extremely ugly by the end of the summer.  We're also fast approaching the 90 day reprieve from CA and MX, and Ron Varra and Lutnick are still in his ear telling him what to do, and he will stupidly listen to them.  MX specifically will cause a lot of shortages of fruits and vegetables, while CA fertilizer and energy will be felt later on in the winter and next year.    We. are. cooked.    When the shelves start displaying the impact from this, prices will also steadily rise on the goods that are available.  It's a domino effect that will dramatically wipe out the entire economy... Shipping losses lead to trucking losses, last mile delivery losses too, which lead to less logistics and maintenance services, companies building/ordering less inventory because it just isn't viable to sell in the USA. This all leads to mass layoffs eventually, and could very well turn into America's second great depression.  It's by design - brought to you by Putin and the Oligarchy they've established here.    The problem is that it's a frog boiling in water that not enough people are caring about or envisioning the long term effects from, and there isn't much of anything being done by anyone with power to stop it.  I've been to several protests already and will continue to support them, but let's be honest - they aren't doing anything.  I've been to a town hall with a congressman that dismissed everyone - again pointless lip service at best.  I've written everyone who is supposedly representing me in the House and Senate several times now, and gotten AI form replies - no help there because they aren't representing anyone but themselves and the oligarchs.  AND I've voted for the opposition in the last several elections - again, not enough to do anything.  NONE of it matters or does anything because a good 40% of this country is brainwashed into a cult with probably half of that number just wanting to destroy it all, another 20% can't be bothered to vote and have checked out from caring.  The other countries are happily going around the USA now.  China, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, etc. already have built very strong long term trade deals with one another leaving out the USA.  Those will not come back any time soon.  The value of the dollar will continue to plummet.  BRICS will likely admit many more members, and will use different regional currencies than the dollar, further eroding the USA in soft power and standing.  It's all coming to an end, and I think Trump finally crossed the Rubicon with this one...",WallNumerous3230,2025-05-01T16:42:09,9
"We are pretty much fucked.   All of this is to make the rich people around him a quick buck, while letting him start the house fire only to throw a bucket of water on it to claim he's the savior.",Devistator,2025-05-01T16:08:38,9
"Well the obesity problem will solve itself with no food coming in from Mexico and loss of reliable fertilizer for crops... S/  seriously it will be a lot like bread lines during the depression except probably worse because people are more reliant on programs that are now being eliminated all so the ultra wealthy can get a favourable govt contract or an extra yacht/ jet.   Americans are very accustomed to convenience.  Hardship is not something they're really prepared for as a whole.  This whole thing was self inflicted because many in America are so obsessed with getting their's they do not actually care about other people.       I say this as a Canadian who has observed American media and politics.  American exceptionalism is their downfall. It is what allowed Trump in as president in 2016.  Americans are observed internationally as arrogant bullies with a hero complex.  Trump has proven that being a long time ally and trade partner is only as good as the current administration. He backs out of deals he signed. This is your representative whether you voted for him or not.  He is the absolute worst of America's worst character flaws.   Even if/when there's another administration after him, the international order is changed. It will take a good while to regain that trust if ever.  The North remembers. ",Basic_Ask8109,2025-05-01T17:29:31,3

Well you will just have to eat less and buy less. Offsetting the cost of the tariffs. And everything will be ok in trumpland,i-read-it-again,2025-05-01T14:40:00,3

"even if he does, i doubt things will go back to anything resembling normal.  china has been a civilization for the last 4,000 years.  they know how to be patient.  trump doesn't.  he's fucked with the wrong country if he thinks they're going to cave anytime soon.",kaett,2025-05-01T14:23:31,16
"That's just it. Even if he reversed every decision he made in the last 100 days the US is hooped in terms of international trade. The damage cannot be undone, just lessened now.  No rational person will ever trust a deal made by the US. Either trump will throw a tantrum and undo the whole thing, or the next admin might come in and do it. No one can trust any deal made by the US ever again. It'll take decades before the world will make good trade deals with the US again.",scubahood86,2025-05-01T14:28:35,8

"While true direct to US citizens sale (Temu, AliExpress, etc) has been gaining a lot of traction, China and US could drop tariffs on goods and China wouldn't have to enter any trade deals with America to reap the benefits of the Americans people and economy.",FlyingRock,2025-05-01T14:27:47,4
trump dropping those tariffs isn't going to happen anytime soon.  neither are the retaliatory ones china has imposed on us.,kaett,2025-05-01T15:28:14,2
"Right, China won't drop until the US does and that is 100% understandable.  As long as Trump doesn't drop his America loses.",FlyingRock,2025-05-01T15:59:23,3
