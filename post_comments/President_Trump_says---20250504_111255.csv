Trump has the maturity level and intellect of a very below average 3rd grade bully. His leadership skills are nil. His negotiation skills are poor. He is the often mentioned ‚Äúloser.‚Äù,SisterActTori,2025-05-04T11:17:43,23
"From the article   > Does a president have to uphold the Constitution?  >> I don‚Äôt know  At first glance you might think this is a wannabe dictator who just wants to trash and not follow the constitution, but honestly it‚Äôs fair enough to conclude that Trump is actually so uneducated that he may not even think presidents have to follow the constitution because he doesn‚Äôt know what the constitution is or does",susibirb,2025-05-04T11:25:05,12

"I would normally say that an individual president doesn't really have the power to radically affect the economy in 100 days so it's always a little mixed as far as ""responsible"" for different trends. But the Trump administration has been so ""move fast and break things"" and just down right erratic that the markets and the downstream affects would have likely been in better shape of the Trump Administration had just done nothing.",the_Russian_Five,2025-05-04T11:20:21,2
