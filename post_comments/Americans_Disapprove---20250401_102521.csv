Why oh why did they vote for him. This country is sooo dumb.,CO_Renaissance_Man,2025-04-01T10:28:11,122
If only someone had warned us  If only we had seen how he operates before hand,aeyraid,2025-04-01T11:02:36,17
His approval rating is probly even worse than the polls show. I gotta imagine many of those who voted for him aren't willing to admit they don't like what he's doing.  edit: typo,aninjacould,2025-04-01T11:04:27,13
"Americans just couldn't handle that black woman. I'm convinced that's what it came down to in the end.  The white man or the black woman...  And now we're all paying a price...  A little 'bragging rights': My husband and I predicted his numbers would nose dive by late March, early April because he's such a fucking fuck-up... we're pretty much on point...  \*\*\* My husband and I were at a concert about two weeks before the election. Three white guys (completely drunk) by the bathrooms openly discussed this very topic, ""I think I am going to go for the white guy....I just don't know that much about her at all..."" for about five minutes... I was horrified but my husband calmly said, ""I hate to break this to you... but a ton of people feel that way....""",_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-04-01T11:00:09,31
"He doesn’t care about popularity this time around. This one is strictly about revenge on his enemies, Heritage Foundation’s agenda, and grifting. I mean, his last term was also, but this time even more so.",throw123454321purple,2025-04-01T11:09:15,8
"He hasn’t done a single thing right. Hell even his idea to get rid of the penny to save money is a lie since it costs about $0.14 to make a nickel, and we would have to increase production of nickels to cover the gap of pennies",annaleigh13,2025-04-01T12:59:35,5
He’s on a revenge tour for 4 frickin’ years!!   Damn all of you extremely pathetic MAGA clowns who voted for him really expecting results. Imagine thinking ‘Trump thinks like me’ lol! Yeah and that’s where it ends. He hates the poor along with all of you ‘supporters’. Damn fools…,DeliciousMinute1966,2025-04-01T13:56:52,4

"Of course they do, he was terrible 4 years ago and he’s terrible now.  He didn’t suddenly shed being a narcissist and embrace empathy.   Most Americans don’t really participate in the fruits of the US economy, so they kicked and incumbents out.  Now they will not benefit again, and some will probably lose their jobs.  Makes no sense to me.  But I live is a highly educated bubble, so I have a blind spot.  I just couldn’t believe Trump could win again.",Solid-Reputation5032,2025-04-01T12:03:09,2

"Are the Democrats ready?  Do they have a detailed plan to fix Trumps mess AND do they have legislation written and ready to go that strengthens the checks and balances so we never experience this disaster again?  The days of not being ready to take advantage of the opportunities are over.  The Democrats have to learn from the organization, planning and implementation the Trump team used to deploy their shitty agenda.

"I think one of the largest reason is that each side fail to match up to what they said they will do. You have Republicans blocking everything that the Dems do, and Dems have promises that it's impossible to keep, when they have some semblance of power they don't use all the tools available as they stick to the rules and Republicans are more interested in doing whatever they want regardless of if it's the proper way. Look at all these executive orders that are going to get denied after court for firing. How many billions of tax players money is going to be spent sorting this crap out. In the end it's time for major realignment. Let's start with:  No more than 2 term cycles or 10 years in roles of members of house, senates, judge, or president/Vp  Retirement age enforced, on all political roles. No more out of touch people making the Senate, house etc looking like a hospice facility.  If people want to continue political roles they can but only on a state level, not a national level. Retirement still enforced.",cyberman0,2025-04-01T12:20:12,6

"That’s exactly what it is.   People in my area aren’t afraid to be racist and misogynistic, especially if they’re talking to another white man, which most of them take me as even though I’m a majority Native American.   Nevertheless, I get a lot of the “hey man let’s go talk over here for a minute” stuff that ends up leading to a hushed racist or misogynistic conversation.   It’s so common that there are things that could be considered bad if said in public, in most places, that are just said like normal around here. Such as, and I promise this is the relevant part:  “Women are just too emotional to be in positions of leadership”  These types of phrases are so COMMON that they come straight out of the “best” people, on the spectrum, and are agreed upon universally. EVEN BY OTHER WOMEN   They literally believe that it is an INHERENT truth. There aren’t enough democrats around here to actually sway any elections, but even the few democrats that I personally know most of them voted third party or didn’t vote because they couldn’t “bring themselves to vote for a women for a position a man should hold”",Naptasticly,2025-04-01T12:16:53,9

he didn’t “cheat” but twitter was used to push trump and right wing positions heavily before the election,TheTalkerofThings,2025-04-01T12:35:14,1
I heard a lot of people say Project 25 isn't what you think. The bullet points they put out didn't sound that terrible when compared to message of the right wing politicians. It was pretty much in line with that message. It's when you delve in and start reading the actual document that it makes your stomach turn.

"We also assume we have people’s votes are guaranteed because of the color of their skin or the fact that they have ovaries.

"This is right.   What I really worry about is that people get absorbed into the right wing propaganda and they do not come out of it.

"100% yes - ""something"" cheated the system to land votes in his favour and/or, conversely, remove votes from his opponent  and as I've said before, I believe a similar mechanism was in-play for 2020's election that more or less guaranteed djt a win at that time.  And it was because of this that he went absolutely apeshit when the polls came back in Biden's favour.  The rigging was in to solidify his (djt's) win but somehow failed to deliver (not rigged hard enough), and this is why he was so hellbent on claiming ""*the steal, it was rigged, stolen, no way this could have happened, Dems cheated to win*"" because in fact, it was rigged.  For his victory - not the other way around.",WetFinsFine,2025-04-01T14:43:59,20

"Regarding 2020/  you’re right. The vote-switching was done on the in-person early voting data, if I remember correctly. But what the cheaters weren’t planning for was that Covid would force huge numbers of people to vote by mail. And because voting by mail was so disproportionately large, the vote-switching on the early in-person segment wasn’t enough to move the cheater past the bar.  That was my understanding of the presentation.   Back to 2024:  The last work I heard about it was that the NGO that did the analysis was requesting an audit in all seven states where they found the anomaly, all being swing states.  What’s really creepy is that the profile of these highly improbable statistical anomalies that should never occur in a million elections has been seen before:  an election in the Republic of Georgia, in which the pro-Russia candidate eked out a win, and in Romania, where, ditto, the pro-Russia candidate also eked out a win.  I will be furious if this lead is left on the vine to wither. This has got to be pursued with a full and serious investigation.  But I fear that the Dems want so much NOT to seem like a party that cries foul every time they lose, or that is eroding public confidence in our purportedly free and fair elections, that they won’t pursue it.",Dear_Director_303,2025-04-02T16:35:14,2
