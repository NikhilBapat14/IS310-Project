"> During the surveillance, investigators documented drug trafficking, prostitution, and the presence of people suspected to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, the international gang MS-13, and the Hells Angels, Pullen said.   So Hells Angels are hanging out at Mexican Clubs? Yeah right..",BigFishPub,2025-04-28T11:55:36,29
I am expecting that all accusations of gang associations are all BS.,thieh,2025-04-28T12:13:57,8

This is so fishy. Especially the drug trafficking - where are the drugs or evidence that people were distributing. There's a bit in the article where the police say when they raided everyone dropped their drugs on the ground. Pointing to a bunch of personal use,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-04-28T14:52:39,1

And Tren de Aragua and MS-13 are just chilling together too? I doubt it.,RustToRedemption,2025-04-28T11:57:25,20
Any Bloods & Crips? Is this some sort of international club?,GallowBarb,2025-04-28T12:00:23,14
It's like multiracial gangs in 80s TV. Gotta have one of each.,travio,2025-04-28T12:34:53,6
"Not that far of a stretch though, really. Hells Angels also participated in acid tests in the sixties.  It is easy to surmise they like latina prostitutes and trafficking drugs/making deals that make money.    If the DEA was actually waiting for a good time to strike, it'd be at that club when those members were together. Organized crime groups do make soft partnerships.   Not saying you or I are correct, as the potential for this being ""Trump'd"" up is still just a plausible.  ",Drangly,2025-04-28T12:44:44,1
"Yeah, even if the gun is ultimately not enough to protect yourself it will at least make sure that you die in a hail of gunfire as opposed to in a goddamn concentration camp. And we are at the depressing point where that is preferable.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T12:17:03,6
"I think you’re being lied too. I don’t think Hells Angels, MS-13, and Venezuelan gangs are all hanging out together in one club. While also doing all their business together. That’s so fictional, a tv script would reject it.",Static-Stair-58,2025-04-28T12:05:58,15
