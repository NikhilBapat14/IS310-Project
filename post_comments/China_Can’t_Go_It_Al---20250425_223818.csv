"It's fascinating how the Treasury Secretary recently said that the tariff war was ""unsustainable""....and everyone just assumed that Trump caved. In point of fact, the markets were temporarily buoyed....and nothing else changed. The Chinese insist there are no negotiations going on. Now, they've removed tariffs on a number of essential imports from the USA.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-26T08:01:01,11
"China needs OUR purchases....  In 2023, the United States received $502 billion of China's global exports, which accounted for 14.8% of China's total exports that year. This share was the largest for any single country, significantly exceeding the second-largest recipient, Hong Kong, which accounted for 8.2% of China's exports.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T07:04:43,5
"However, all of these lessons are unlikely to hold in what might be called Trade War 2.0. First, with tariffs now reaching as high as 170 percent—or even 245 percent when including Section 301 duties—it would be virtually impossible for China to offset the impact through currency devaluation. Even an 85 percent devaluation would push the exchange rate to about 13 RMB (Chinese yuan) per dollar, a level that would almost certainly trigger panic across financial markets and the broader economy.  In the end, it may turn out that the United States is the only country capable of helping China out of its fix. Which is why, despite the growing tensions and escalating rhetoric, I believe U.S.-China negotiations will likely begin within two months. Given China’s current economic troubles, it simply cannot afford to wait much longer.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T05:12:18,5
"I think the argument around economic resilience is sound, but I also think  the Chinese people are very good at enduring hardship and their government has excellent control of their information. We aren’t so good at hardship and have free speech. So this may just be a lose-lose one.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-27T22:01:34,1
