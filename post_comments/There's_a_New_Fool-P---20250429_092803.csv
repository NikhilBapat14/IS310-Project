"The vast majority of people still don't know what the F DEI is. It is not ""give minorities opportunities instead of white people"". It is anti-discrimination. Don't deny people opportunities because they aren't white.  If you need the advantages that discrimination brings you because you can't compete fairly, or you just plain don't like people who aren't white, just admit it and own it. Stop pretending that DEI was hurting you in some way.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T09:32:11,27

I mean the most benefitted group from affirmative action and dei was white woman. Over every other racial group. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-29T09:39:36,5
"That's why it was such a bad idea to change it to DEI from Equal Opportunity.   Equal Opportunity was already well defined, so there was almost no chance the GOP could demonize it.   By coming up with a new, unfamiliar, name for the same program... it allowed the GOP to redefine it in the eyes of the voter.   Just like they did for police funding, which was renamed ""defund the police"", despite it doing nothing of the sort.   ---   Democrats and leftists need to stop renaming stuff that already exists, all it does is make people wary of it. (After all, it can't be the same thing if it's called something else, right?)",Joadzilla,2025-04-29T09:39:03,3

*Equal Opportunity is a law and is not the same as DEI.*   So what does DEI do that EO doesn't?,Joadzilla,2025-04-29T10:22:33,-4
They also mischaracterize them.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-29T10:11:15,8
"It wasn't a problem before. Clearly there are plenty of racists in the GOP but you can't publicly say, ""I don't want everyone to have equal opportunities"".",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T10:37:15,-2
"DEI is initiatives like “let’s send a recruiter to this historically black college in addition to sending one to State”.  They’re about broadening the search, not avoiding discrimination against those that already found you.  And there’s similar in-workplace things to make it appeal to more than white males, not just “don’t violate discrimination laws”.  The reason so many companies jumped on board is not because they were afraid of the law.  Broader searches for employees puts downward pressure on wages, and they could do it with minimal cost.",6a6566663437,2025-04-29T11:56:30,4
Of course not. But they've always relied on dogwhistles. Whether it's DEI or Affirmative Action or whatever they want to call it. But they've always been complaining about it behind the buzzwords. Misrepresenting what it was about on purpose was just to be expected.,Muted-Implement-9841,2025-04-29T10:51:52,4
"Okay, that's different. This is also the first time I've heard DEI described in a way that was different than EO.  Thank you.",Joadzilla,2025-04-29T15:05:44,1
"That’s because Republicans and right-wing media are lying about what DEI is.  It’s a lot harder to attack DEI when you describe it accurately.  So they created their own version to attack.  They think “how would I implement a program with those goals?”, and strict quotas is what makes sense to them.  So that’s what they claim it is.  Claiming everyone non-white-male is incompetent and only hired due to strict quotas is an added bonus since it riles up the base.  And the president.",6a6566663437,2025-04-29T15:15:56,4
