"It's sad that a significant portion of our population is stupid enough to be swayed by articles like this. Even if all the allegations against Garcia are true, which is unlikely, it doesn't matter. Sending someone to be imprisoned for life in a foreign country without ever being tried or convicted of a crime is extremely unconstitutional, and we should not allow it to happen to anyone.",Tbone2797,2025-05-02T10:43:58,1

"Now we like due process and the constitution? What about COVID? Where was the due process then? In California (Los Angeles specifically) they were able to suspend the constitution, citing emergency orders and safety. They were able to suspend the sixth amendment for anyone who had been arrested and charged of a crime. You could be sitting in jail indefinitely until the emergency mandate (which is based on a virus that had less than 1% fatality rate) until they deemed it ""safe."" Also, if you did finally go to trial, you didn't have the right to face your accuser due to the fact that it was deemed unsafe to be in the same room; again, going against the constitution. Multiple people were arrested, simply for going outside (for example, the lone paddle border) and many businesses had to be shut down. Also, anyone who was suspected of having a gathering of multiple people in the residence could (and did) have their power cut out again leaving out any due process all while our governor was dining indoors at the French Laundry. Children were not allowed to go to school due to a virus that affected children even less than adults and as a result we have one of the most anxious generation of children with no social skills. We have multiple businesses, small businesses and restaurants shut down that no longer exist due to the fact that they enacted these emergency mandates. We also had people being fired from their jobs and the military due to refusing to take a medical treatment that was mandated on people which once again we found out wasn’t as effective as they initially said. People were fired from jobs over this. Where was “due process” then?",zero708970,2025-05-02T15:03:38,1

The whole reason he didnt want to be deported back home is because retaliation from a rival gang. Also there are numerous instances of illegals being let go after committing violent crimes over the last few years.  Even Eric Adams spoke out against it. Think about all the people who have been harmed by illegal criminals for once in your life. Im sure you live a very sheltered life in a very safe neighborhood but others have to live with the consequences of allowing criminals to roam free.,Least-Complaint-6566,2025-05-02T13:28:52,1
"That is not why he did not want to be deported back him.  That is just an outright misrepresentation.  There is nothing in his order that states that he is in a gang and that he fears a rival gang.  That is made up.  What happened was that he was not in a gang in El Salvador and his family, due to their business, was targeted by a gang and extorted for money.  They threatened to take him and his older brother and force them to join the gang if his parents did not pay.  Which is why they sent him away.  Had nothing to do with a gang rivalry.  Stop making things up.  No one is stating that criminals who commit violent crimes, regardless of legal status, should be released.  However, the fact that you jump from Garcia to violent criminals is exactly the problem.  Garcia has not been convicted of any violent crimes and yet you still want to essentially lump him, and seemingly all illegal immigrants, as violent offenders when they are not.  Most people are fine with a more secure border and are fine with removing people that should not be here, but many of us (myself included) do not think that we need to demonize people and treat them like they are less than human merely because they are undocumented.  We don't need to send them to foreign prisons for life simply because they don't have proper paperwork to be in this country.  That is both cruel and unconstitutional.",WhatRUHourly,2025-05-02T13:34:28,1
Progressives in sanctuary cites have absolutely been refusing to prosecute migrant criminals and work with ICE and have been releasing repeat offenders for years prior to Trump. Also quit with the mental gymnastics You just also made up a whole absolutely ridiculous story.,Least-Complaint-6566,2025-05-02T13:41:25,1
"What part was made up?  Be specific.  That is not really what sanctuary cities are or what they do.  By and large it means two things:  1. Just because a person has an interaction with the police does not mean that the police will do an immigration status check on that person.  The point of this is that if an illegal immigrant is a victim of or witness to a crime, they do not want the immigrant to fail to report the crime or to go to police because they fear deportation.  This is an attempt to make us all safer by encouraging people to come forward with information that can stop actual violent crimes.    2. When a person is incarcerated for a criminal offense that they commit they receive a sentence that has an end date.  Sanctuary cities have stated that they will not hold incarcerated individuals past their end date and for an indefinite amount of time because that is unConstitutional and is a violation of that person's rights.  If ICE wants to take custody of those persons they need to do so prior to their sentence ending.  I like the Constitution and I don't think the government should be violating it by holding people past their release date.",WhatRUHourly,2025-05-02T13:48:55,1
