"Of all the disturbing and disgusting aspects of Trump's political career, to me perhaps the worst is the phenomenon of all these so-called ""Christians"" embracing the most amoral,-un-Christian man ever to hold the presidency. Trump would sell all their souls to Satan for $5 apiece if he could.",EIU86,2025-05-03T08:43:46,18

"Do you know why theocracies, despite not lacking in high IQ people, do not dominate any industry, do not develop ground breaking tech? Simply because innovation is being slowed down through the rule of religious authorities who quickly dismiss of outlaws any knowledge that they feel is harmful to their religion.  Well Trump wants to turn America into a theocracy...",Agressive-toothbrush,2025-05-03T09:07:52,6
If people can walk up to my door....knock repeatedly and ring the bell.....for the sole reason of spreading their Christian religion....  ......then the Christian religion is not under scrutiny...or missing in our country.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-03T08:38:54,14

"Their whole campaign is on how flawed America is:  Make America Great Again... so you admit it isn't, but didn't you run as president, so why couldn't you 'fix' it the first time?  Make America Healthy Again... so it wasn't trying to be healthy with scientific research for curing diseases?  Make America Safe Again... so it was unsafe for everyone or just because you made up some lies about lack of border control under Biden.   Make America Religious Again... it already is the people that go to church get their religion and spiritual practice from there. üòÜ   Make America Dictatorship üá∫üá∏  the Trump administration is MAD (yes, an offshoot of insane)",Financial-Special766,2025-05-03T08:48:31,5

Is this why he released a photo of himself as the next Pope?,Koren55,2025-05-03T10:23:04,3
Where did religion go? When a bishop tried to rebuke his unchristian behavior he threw an online hissy fit and got his moron supporters to send her death threats. And he just posted an ai image of himself as the new pope.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-03T08:30:52,7

What a crock of shit. It's not up to the government to bring back religion. It's never been gone. There is a reason our forefathers left it out of our constitution. The separation of Church and State is there for a reason. tRump is in no way religious. He's as close as one can get to being the anti-Christ.,Harry_Mud,2025-05-03T10:15:47,2

"And Trump can lead the way by advising people how to become good Christians by not lying, not being selfish, not cheating in business, not pocketing government money, not raping anyone, not stirring up hatred and anger against minority groups and generally by adopting a loving approach to everyone you encounter.  Can't wait to hear Trump's first sermon.",crazybones,2025-05-03T10:26:20,1

"‚ÄúWhen fascism comes to America, it‚Äôll be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.‚Äù  Whoever wrote Revelations was a genius, because stupid Christians are so easily duped into following evil people.

"Characteristics of Fascism:  1. Powerful, often exclusionary, populist nationalism centered on cult of a redemptive, ‚Äúinfallible‚Äù leader who never admits mistakes.  2. Political power derived from questioning reality, endorsing myth and rage, and promoting lies.  3. **Fixation with perceived national decline, humiliation, or victimhood.**  4. White Replacement ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù used to show that democratic ideals of freedom and equality are a threat. Oppose any initiatives or institutions that are racially, ethnically, or religiously harmonious.  5. Disdain for human rights while seeking purity and cleansing for those they define as part of the nation.  6. Identification of ‚Äúenemies‚Äù/scapegoats as a unifying cause. Imprison and/or murder opposition and minority group leaders.  7. Supremacy of the military and embrace of paramilitarism in an uneasy, but effective collaboration with traditional elites. Fascists arm people and justify and glorify violence as ‚Äúredemptive‚Äù.  8. Rampant sexism.  9. Control of mass media and undermining ‚Äútruth‚Äù.  10. Obsession with national security, crime and punishment, and fostering a sense of the nation under attack.  11. **Religion and government are intertwined.**  12. Corporate power is protected and labor power is suppressed.  13. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts not aligned with the fascist narrative.  14. Rampant cronyism and corruption. Loyalty to the leader is paramount and often more important than competence.  15. Fraudulent elections and creation of a one-party state.  16. Often seeking to expand territory through armed conflict.",TintedApostle,2025-05-03T08:50:19,11
"Nah, see, here's the thinking: They only want America great, healthy, safe, religious, for a very specific kind of American--namely white, hetero, cis, evangelical Christians.  Until America becomes the model home for that ~~_Aryan_~~ American demographic, they have to keep buying into the myth that they are victims, that the county is consistently going to hell in a hand basket, and that everybody else is the devil incarnate.",SolemnestSimulacrum,2025-05-03T09:23:08,3
"I knew someone growing up who had an obsession about being right about everything, despite evidence to the contrary to what he was saying. He went on to become a priest. Forgive the pun, but using the authority of the church to validate your arguments is the ultimate, excuse the pun, trump card. Trump is a savant at understanding power. He probably gets the same idea, but the whole pope thing is just trolling.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-03T09:31:21,1
"Yes. The Christian nationalists have taken over the government along with Yarvin worshippers, who have similar goals. They believe they should have dominion over all aspects of society.
