"That would be funny if Rubio, wearing however many  hats he has now, gets that many votes in a 25A cabinet meeting, and successfully gets trump thrown out for mental incompetence  Yeah there's a like a 0.001% chance of that happening,* but it feels good to dream. Y'all remember what dreams felt like?  * Edit: and jd is arguably worse",O918,2025-05-01T20:36:50,4
I was wondering why I didn't see any Reddit posts about this.  The administration isn't even trying. No one can successfully do both of these jobs.,rainshowers_5_peace,2025-05-01T20:51:57,4
I wonder if he's setting himself up to be heir apparent when Trump dies. He was voted in as SOS 99-0 so he'll use that as justification for taking power in the post-Trump vacuum.,Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-01T20:07:31,6

"this. is. bad. back when trump claimed he never even signed the alien enemy act (which should be brought up in every court hearing right?) he also said “Other people handled it, but (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio has done a great job and he wanted them out and we go along with that.”  rubio, a birthright citizen of cuban immigrant parents, seems to be the guy driving all of this and just grabbed a ton more power.   it also might send a message to secretary of defense hegseth that if walz can get fired over signalgate he can too. trumps recent military-as-police eo says the sec of defense has 90days to advise basically the rules of engagement. so will hegseth rubberstamp afraid of being fired, or maybe he gets fired anyway within 90 days and marco fucking rubio becomes sec of defense as well?",wordfiend99,2025-05-01T20:05:49,2
