">And if all this wasn‚Äôt enough, Trump‚Äôs¬†[Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.advocate.com/tag/department-of-health-and-human-services)¬†piles on. Thursday, it released a¬†[so-called report¬†](https://www.advocate.com/politics/trump-gender-affirming-care-report)that revives the discredited, debunked, and outright abusive practice of¬†[conversion therapy](https://www.advocate.com/conversion-therapy). The same ‚Äúreport‚Äù attacks¬†[gender-affirming care,](https://www.advocate.com/tag/gender-affirming-care)¬†despite overwhelming medical consensus, from every major health organization in the U.S., that such care is¬†*essential*¬†and¬†*lifesaving*¬†for¬†[transgender](https://www.advocate.com/tag/transgender)¬†youth.  >In 2024,¬†[Stanford University published](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/09/conversion-practices-lgbt.html)¬†a landmark study showing that LGBTQ+ people who are subjected to conversion practices are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide. Another recent analysis by the¬†[Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles,](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/impact-gac-ban-eo/)¬†found that denying¬†[gender-affirming care](https://www.advocate.com/health/what-is-gender-affirming-care)¬†to trans youth is directly associated with severe psychological distress, increased rates of depression, and higher suicide risk.  >Trump voters, you don‚Äôt get to read those statistics and shrug. You don‚Äôt get to see these lives in crisis and say, ‚ÄúWell, I liked Trump‚Äôs stance on inflation.‚Äù Or worse, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll bring down egg prices.‚Äù These selfish, shortsighted, and dangerous reasons to support a known danger to the LGBTQ+ community are paramount to giving a death sentence to queer kids.  >You don‚Äôt get to support a candidate whose policies will lead to dead queer kids and then cry foul when someone holds you accountable. If you voted for Trump, you endorsed a future where suicide hotlines are defunded, doctors are criminalized for providing affirming care, and LGBTQ+ kids are told by their own government that they are broken, diseased, and unworthy of love or protection.  Perfectly stated. I have nothing more to add. If you voted for Trump, you voted for the genocide of trans people, full stop.ü´∞üèø",southpawFA,2025-05-05T15:45:20,26

">There was a reason crisis calls from¬†[LGBTQ+ youth spiked 700 percent](https://www.advocate.com/election/crisis-calls-lgbtq-youth)¬†the night¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.advocate.com/donald-trump)¬†was elected last November. And there was a reason they¬†[soared again](https://www.advocate.com/health/crisis-calls-surge-trump-inauguration)¬†around the time of his inauguration. Those weren‚Äôt just coincidental stress flares. They were cries for help from young queer people who saw what was coming.  >Now¬†[the 988 crisis line](https://www.advocate.com/news/988-crisis-cuts-catastrophic-consequences)¬†that¬†[LGBTQ](https://www.pride.com/lgbtq/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks)\+ kids depend on is on the chopping block. The¬†[Biden](https://www.advocate.com/joe-biden)¬†administration¬†[helped build this resource](https://www.advocate.com/lgbt-youth/lgbtq-youth-crisis-hotline), one that tens of thousands of queer youth rely on when they‚Äôre contemplating the unthinkable. And now, under the threat of the vindictive Trump, that support system could be gutted, its programs dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth cut with its funding drained and reallocated.  >This isn‚Äôt just policy cruelty. This is a road map to guaranteed tragedy.    Republicans would rather have dead kids than trans kids. Christian nationalists are doing everything to eradicate trans people in their genocide.

100 percent of Trump supporters literally masturbate to LGBT youth suffering and dying. They won't care about history or judgment.,Farting_Sunshine,2025-05-05T15:45:50,17
"History judging the actions of Trump voters isn't nothing, but it's pretty slim recompense for the families that have lost or will lose children because of what is happening in the US right now.  Like everything else, Trump voters won't give a shit unless or until it personally affects them. The article lays out that this was all clearly telegraphed by P2025, but it just. Doesn't. Fucking. Matter. To these people.  Trump voters *do* only care about *their* egg prices, and they will gladly walk over the corpses of children to get those mythical cheap eggs. If they cared about dead kids, there would be gun control laws in the US after the dozens and dozens of mass/school shootings over the past decades.",vanhellion,2025-05-05T15:47:21,16

"My parents voted for Trump despite their niece having a trans husband who they love and have committed to being ""adoptive parents"" to because his disowned him when he was younger. They literally see their niece, her husband, and their kids more than me.  You can't reason with them. It's not going to be that bad, he didn't mean it, the pendulum will swing back the other way, and so on and so on. Endless excuses. I can't even say they don't care because to say they don't care would mean they understand the situation and don't care about it. It's like their brains refuse to put the thoughts together.",LocalEquivalent52,2025-05-05T15:52:22,10

"Gregory H Stanton, President of¬†[Genocide Watch](http://www.genocidewatch.com/)¬†developed the 10 stages of genocide which explains the different stages which lead to genocide. At each of the earlier stages there is an opportunity for members of the community or the International Community to halt the stages and stop genocide before it happens.     So, if you read this, you know genocide is never a 1-off murder. It's a systematic dehumanization process that leads to mass extermination.
