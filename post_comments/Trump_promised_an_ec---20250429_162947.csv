Huh? This title implies that the majority of economists believe he has brought in an economic revival and the few that disagree think he fell just short.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-29T16:37:55,2

I would like to know which economists think he's handling the economy well. It's probably *an* economist - Peter Navarro - but even he is probably incensed that the tariffs aren't high enough.,TurboSalsa,2025-04-29T16:37:38,1

"Welcome to the Republican party. More so, welcome to Republicans post MAGA.  **Step one**, have an economy that isn't jumping back or growing enough, so run a campaign on ""fixing the economy"".  **Step two**, inherit a halfway decent economy.  **Step three**, funnel all the money up to the top 10% despite Reaganomics being a proven failure in numerous ways. Cut programs that the middle, and especially the lower class, rely/depend on. Call this an ""entitlement"" and get your supporters to parrot this. Remember, you need a scapegoat to fund the government after your trillions in tax cuts (that the hardest working and poorest people won't see the benefit of).  **Step four**, bask in the glory of yet another recession you've caused. People are pissed. You blame the Democrats. If you're feeling frisky, blame literally anyone but yourself.  **Step five**, step back and enjoy the responsibility (none, obviously) of leading the party of 10 of 11 recessions post WWII. You still blame your predecessor, but polled Americans are starting to disagree.  **Step six**, rock a 39-44% approval rating not 3 months into your term and double down on your arrogance at the same time.  I tuned this for MAGA, but it's pretty much a broken record with the GOP at this point. How anyone can have access to the poverty rates, *education scores*, obesity rates, child hunger rates, and elevated federal revenue usage of red states and still vote for the same Republicans that leave red states underperforming like clockwork is baffling to me. *Oh, that's why.*",Coopnadian,2025-04-29T17:33:38,1
