First of all - what the f…??! Second - *purchase* or solicit? If purchasing people of any age wasn’t illegal I’m a bit surprised..,nee_nu_jaa,2025-04-30T15:24:24,56
"If the headline seems absurd at face-value, you need to dig for nuances.  As I understand it, concerns include the potential to criminalize consensual sexual activity between two teenagers and worries that the new law could be weaponized in cases involving interracial or LGBTQ+ relationships. So the nuance is with the unintended or disingenuous consequences of the proposed law.",MrYdobon,2025-04-30T15:16:06,111

You mean it isn't?      Can't wait for the Republicans to send this to the Supreme Court to be called unconstitutional or something.   The MAGA-bros need their egos stroked and women with brains who aren't controlled by a pimp will have nothing to do with them.,Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-04-30T17:29:29,4

"I *think* it’s referring to prostitution, which is illegal in California regardless. It’s about the magnitude of punishment. Currently it’s a felony for 15 and under, 16 + 17 it’s a misdemeanor.  The article title is kind of inflammatory and misleading, imo. It already is illegal they just want to change the punishment.",mad-i-moody,2025-04-30T18:00:13,29
