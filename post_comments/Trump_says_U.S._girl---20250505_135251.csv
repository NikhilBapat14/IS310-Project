"President Donald Trump again is downplaying the threat of supply shortages from his tariffs, even if it means fewer toys for American children.  ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old-girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old-girl, doesn‚Äôt need 37 dolls,‚Äù Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.  ‚ÄúShe could be very happy with two or three or four or five,‚Äù Trump said.  The comments are the third time in less than a week that the president has brushed aside concerns about the effect on U.S. consumers from his new steep tariffs on China, and suggested that Americans should be comfortable with fewer things.

Replace dolls with medical equipment or pharmaceuticals and Trump's response is a lot less cute.  Framing the situation as if toys are the biggest thing American consumers will have to be concerned with is both out of touch and dishonest as hell.,kingofcrosses,2025-05-05T14:03:38,7

"It‚Äôs a shit reason, and also why you can‚Äôt have an educated conversation with them, but they support Trump due to decades of targeted propaganda that taps into deep cultural issues like abortion, immigration, and the decline of traditional industries such as coal and manufacturing. These narratives have been reinforced by conservative media, religious institutions, and political figures who frame complex socioeconomic changes as moral or national threats, creating a sense of victimhood and nostalgia for a simpler, more secure past. In areas where educational resources are limited and civic education is weak, many people rely on their televisions for political understanding, creating an environment where slogans and soundbites shape political loyalty.",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-05-05T14:24:09,8
