Gotta love that some union leaders backed Trump knowing that he’d come after them,Ricothebuttonpusher,2025-04-26T23:32:23,24

"At this point, the dem judges need to start ordering arrests for the ones carrying this shit out. The other side of the table is playing dirty, time for Dems to do the same.",uhvarlly_BigMouth,2025-04-26T19:31:56,91
Well duh! There's more short-sighted money to made from the outrage clicks Trump generates!,ChickenSalad96,2025-04-27T03:32:08,3
What’s funny is that not all republican judges are on board with it either. A fair number of significant immigration cases have been halted by R judges,QuarkGuy,2025-04-26T19:58:31,44
"Not sure why they aren’t doing this already, most of the protections federal employees have relating to being held accountable go away if the actions they took are illegal.  The ICE agents that arrested that judge should absolutely have charges placed on them and if the prosecutors win it will open the floodgates to holding a lot more of them accountable.",Deep_Alps7150,2025-04-26T20:03:50,11
"Don’t get down to their level! Never play dirty, it will only hurt you in the long run",TheRealBummelz,2025-04-27T17:34:45,1
That shouldn't be surprising. Judges are supposed to be impartial.,harry_manback-,2025-04-26T20:22:24,27
"Is there any concern that the executive want it contested in court because they think it can eventually go to a stacked deck like the Supreme Court? Or, rather… whether or not it’s plausible, could the judges we’re discussing here believe that—thus explaining their inaction? Genuinely asking.",DuckDatum,2025-04-26T21:01:39,2
"That strategy has gotten nowhere. When they go low, you meet them where they’re at if going high doesn’t work. Honestly, there are no high roads, they’re all closed.",uhvarlly_BigMouth,2025-04-27T22:43:55,1
"And most are conservatives, not MAGA",jgoble15,2025-04-26T20:23:42,16
"Yeah and that's the bare minimum. It's so fucked a real defense is ""hey some Republican judges aren't openly violating the constitution""",Niznack,2025-04-27T02:18:02,4
SCOTUS unanimously voted against the detention of Garcia. His sway over them is gone. Only two are guaranteed evil pieces of shit. The rest are more self serving and don’t want to lose their power by enabling Trump more. I don’t think it’s guaranteed that his court will vote with him anymore.,uhvarlly_BigMouth,2025-04-26T22:36:41,7
"Well unless action is taken by feds or marshals, him and his regime are just going to continue ignoring judges, laws and the constitution and not have any consequences and continue with unchecked power.   No one in his regime was held accountable for breaking the Espionage Act in that first Signal leak. If anyone else had done that, they would've been forcefully grabbed (stripped of any duties) and swiftly trialed (and prosecuted).   Yet crickets. Its only taken a second time for the 1 to maybe be kicked out? TBD. Not charged.",Successful_Sign_6991,2025-04-27T01:40:44,3
Agreed. I’m sick and tired of Dems suing or decrying shit. ARREST THEM!,uhvarlly_BigMouth,2025-04-27T07:11:29,1
