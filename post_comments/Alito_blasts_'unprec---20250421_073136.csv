"Congress has the power to limit the courts, including SCOTUS, even to the point of denying them jurisdiction on a specific issue. They could easily put an end to district courts overstepping their authority. Good luck though, it could take years for Congress to agree on a lunch order.",Faelwolf,2025-04-21T10:14:03,30
"I'd like to hear the reasoning for this decision from the court, but that's not going to happen. It's concerning that SCOTUS was willing to issue a ruling on this case before it played out in the lower courts, effectively denying the defendants any ability to plead their case before judgement was rendered.  In the past SCOTUS has steadfastly refused to consider cases that have not run their course through the judicial system first. That they essentially have an ""emergency session"" in the middle of the night to do just that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented. We need consistency from the court, especially in times like these today.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-21T08:05:47,22

"The counter argument here is that they've had so many lower courts trying to issue sweeping nationwide injunctions that SCOTUS decided it was best for them to just hit the pause button and take up the case. Supreme Court will either affirm Trump's ability to deport under the AEA and a backlog of Venezuelan gang members will all hop on some C130s or they'll say that he can't deport them under AEA and they'll just get deported the normal, slightly less efficient way.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-21T09:04:08,38
The courts have been seizing more and more power over the last few decades. It is a concerning move towards authoritarianism. The solution to this is not the idiotic leftist pack the courts idea but to rein in their power back to the constitutional limits.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T08:41:42,-7
Yes the courts have been seizing more and more power lately. This is not normal.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T08:43:02,0
"I understand where you're coming from but SCOTUS just recently ruled 9-0 that Trump can use the AEA, and with this latest decision essentially invalidated that. Even Kagan, of all people, recently outright refused to hear a similar case. There needs to be some consistency in our highest court.   Edit: clarity",social_dinosaur,2025-04-21T09:16:44,-1

"Wasn't the 9-0 ruling just that the DC District Court didn't have venue to try the case or issue temporary restraining orders on it because the aliens are in Texas?   I think SCOTUS has been having difficulty these days with all these activist District Judges just doing whatever they want. They're forced to act faster than they normally would, because District Judges are just issuing injunctions at the drop of a hat. It is highly irregular for SCOTUS to issue a decision in the middle of the night but as we've seen from the ""Maryland Man"" case, once an alien is removed they're impossible to get back. The most certain course for SCOTUS is to just pause all deportations of the class in question while the details get worked out. The administration can just focus of other deportations for now and once the process under the AEA gets clarified they can proceed with those deportations.    My understanding is that the main question about the AEA isn't whether it can be used, it's whether aliens get a right to defend themselves in court. Past invocations of the act have applied broadly to all citizens of an enemy country. It was easy to say that an alien was British in 1812, from the Central Powers during WWI, or from the Axis Powers during WWII. This time, Trump has invoked the act but limited it to Venezuelan Citizens over 14 who are members of TdA. It's hard for them to contest that they're Venezuelan, but easier to contest that they're members of TdA.    It would have been more straightforward if Trump had just applied it to all Venezuelans. Just as not every British citizen in America in 1812 was necessarily an agent of the Crown, not every Venezuelan is TdA, but the Venezuelan Government has been intentionally sending TdA members to live here, so all subjects of the Venezuelan Government get to deal with the consequences.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-21T09:42:17,3
"> My understanding is that the main question about the AEA isn't whether it can be used, it's whether aliens get a right to defend themselves in court.  That isn't the question. That's already the case. The 5-4 decision on the 7th reaffirmed that. For most of the original deportees, the judiciary already determined their gang status in other court proceedings prior. Now that the backlog is out, determining gang status involves a specific hearing.",cplusequals,2025-04-21T10:27:13,4
"My understanding is that decision is in response to the ruling from Xinis which was that Trump had no legal grounds to deport Garcia without ""due process"" and that the AEA could not be used at all. In typical recent SCOTUS fashion the court issued that vague 9-0 ruling that has become open to interpretation. Trump, on one hand, took that ruling to mean he could deport any who had gang or criminal affiliations without ""due process"" while the left thinks that all have the ability to go through the entire court system before a decision is rendered on their deportability.  Generally speaking, as you know, any who come here illegally are entitled to have a hearing before an immigration court to determine their deportation status. The biggest issue with that is the sheer number of petitioners. It should be that the finding of the immigration court is binding and the process ends there. Trump is trying to speed up the process of deporting suspected, and sometimes known, alien criminals and gang members who I believe don't get the benefit of the doubt. They didn't come through a port of entry and therefore many, including me, believe they've forfeited any perceived rights they may have had under our law. Even Biden and Obama practiced catch and release of those who come over the border illegally without giving them any ""due process"".  The leftists are trying to gum up our legal system with this hoping for a favorable ruling from SCOTUS that they can use as precedent to apply to *all* immigration cases (see the Garcia case). Trump, in part through the AEA is arguing the exact opposite, that the executive has the right and the duty to expel those who fall under the gang and criminal category.  Until we get something definitive from SCOTUS that can be used as precedent for all immigration cases we'll continue down the path we're on now. But whether they're overwhelmed as you suggest or simply don't take a stand at all this legal jockeying looks to continue. Hopefully SCOTUS will decide next month that the decisions handed down by district court judges cannot be applied nationally as they have been. That would be a positive first step to clear all this up. Until then? Who the hell knows.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-21T11:13:29,1
"> It should be that the finding of the immigration court is binding and the process ends there.  I agree.  Or at least a single appeal within the immigration court system.  But it seems the casual liberal wants an unlimited number of appeals and court appearances, and they should be held to a ""without a shadow of a doubt"" burden of proof.    And really, not to sound completely uncaring, but there really isn't a remedy for an illegal deported without due process.  Ok bring them back, do another hearing, and then deport them again?  They're not suddenly going to get citizenship through endless rounds of immigration hearings.  At best, they get some borrowed time of staying in the US, attempting to plant some roots to argue they created enough of a life that the law doesn't apply to them anymore.",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-21T11:35:47,2
"Illegal immigrants have no rights under our constitution beyond their petition to an immigration judge to determine their deportability. Appeals in our court system apply *only* to citizens of the United States. This should be obvious to everyone, especially SCOTUS. However, until forced to stop, the left will continue to abuse the system to further their agenda and there appears to be any number of sympathetic liberal federal district judges willing to go beyond their purview to issue sweeping nationwide injunctions to accomodate them.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-21T11:55:41,-5
