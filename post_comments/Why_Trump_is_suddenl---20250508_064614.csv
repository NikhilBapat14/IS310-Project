"But the administration‚Äôs emphasis on toys for¬†*girls*¬†is no gaffe. It is an attempt at misdirection that‚Äôs squarely in line with the MAGA right‚Äôs obsession with traditional, binary gender expressions.  ‚ÄúThe reason they keep using dolls as their example is because they‚Äôre trying to frame caring about material stuff as feminine and thus inherently shameful,‚Äù wrote Leah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive organizing group Indivisible,¬†[on Bluesky.](https://bsky.app/profile/leahgreenberg.bsky.social/post/3lok22cb5s22h)  By focusing on dolls and girls, Trump‚Äôs message of austerity becomes less about sacrificing for his trade war and morphs into more of a taunt: ‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of, your kid won‚Äôt have¬†*dolls*¬†to play with?‚Äù",Smithy2232,2025-05-08T06:53:25,44

"So, make it make sense.  To Trump, girl-coded things are frivolous, like dolls (and cosmetics ‚Ä¶ if Trump was in tune with what today‚Äôs girls also like, he‚Äôd be encouraging smaller Sephulta hauls).  But according to the Gilead-for-Real architects, dolls and domestic playsets get little girls acclimated to their biological and spiritual destiny as mothers. Those dolls should be of babies and toddlers, not Barbie or American Girl dolls. And if girls are commanded to have more than two children when they grow up, then there should be no limit to the amount of ~~training equipment~~ dolls they have.",UFOsBeforeBros,2025-05-08T07:36:18,4

"I think it‚Äôs far more based on his memory. I can envision a Christmas where Ivanka had 30 different dolls on her list and, receiving fewer, had a meltdown that he‚Äôs never forgotten.
