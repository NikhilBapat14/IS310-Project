"> The prison officially closed down because it was too expensive to maintain. It would have required about $3 million to $5 million for further maintenance and restoration work to keep it open. This was not even taking into account the operating costs that were required daily. **It was costing almost 3 times as much to operate this prison when considering the cost per capita per inmate.**  > Everything needed by the prison needed to be supplied by boat. Water, supplies, fuel, and food had to be carried over by boat to the prison. When you consider the amount of freshwater that would be required, the costs really started to add up! **Every week approximately 1 million gallons of freshwater had to be sent by barge over to the island. The operating costs put the prison out of business.**  https://graylineofsanfrancisco.com/why-did-alcatraz-close-down/  another bigly great idea from mr genius /s  probably just another way to funnel money into his own pockets.",oh-shazbot,2025-05-04T19:42:20,312

Trump just makes shit up as he goes along. The National Park Service owns Alcatraz Island.

Often they are required to earthquake resistant in geologically stable areas, have back up power even if they arent critical to govt function an a whole slew of other shit. Critics complain because it all drives up cost but functionally its to ensure contonuity and redundancy in government. Say a major earthquake hit Denver, many parts of the city aren't  built for it. City or state offices may collapse or become unsafe to occupy, in those cases the feds may loan out less critical federal space while local infrastructure is restored. Thats only one example of why, but still.   If a structure costs more than 25 million it has to be appeoved by congress, and 25 mil doesnt get you what it used to.  A lot of facilities use mobile trailers and double wides because they are classified as temporary structures and so dont fall under any of the longevity or building requirements. It also hurts long term function.   All that to say real govt structures are pretty duravle still... but they keep mov9ng away from it because congress has been increasingly hostile to govt costs over the past decade.",toxic_badgers,2025-05-04T23:49:52,9

Funny that the US has such low lifecycles for their buildings although the probability of them standing for a very long time is so high. In contrast in Germany the lowest lifecycle for a building (typically residence) is at least 100 years. That being said lots of buildings live way longer. But (and that's a big one) so many of the buildings got hit during the war and were destroyed. So I guess both countries chose the wrong way of doing things (although very much contrary).,KingSmite23,2025-05-05T04:56:37,1
