"So about 60% of me is sure that this entire thing is just kafabe, Trump and Putin pretending to ""disagree"" and then Trump falling into line like a bitch later, because Putin has kompromat on him and controls him.  But I am at least up to 40% now where I think maybe there is no kompromat. And in fact maybe Donald Trump is *so* deeply fucking stupid that Putin simplly tells him Zelensky is a bad guy and Donald Trump just believes him.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-27T21:17:13,25
"At this point, I am convinced that Trump has been upset that Zelensky was applauded at the Pope's funeral while he was not.  Trump may blame Putin for his embarrassment.  He sees Putin as a friend, but now his friend is hurting his feelings.",I405CA,2025-04-27T21:14:50,19
He has a chat with Zelenskyy   Learns that Russia is bad   He will have a chat with someone else who will blame Ukraine in a few days and he will hate Zelenskyy again  Whoever has his ear and can spend literally two minutes convincing him is how he decides his policies,cup-of-tea-76,2025-04-27T21:17:45,13
"Zelensky was the last person he talked to, so naturally he's kissing his ass. Wait until Vlad gets on the phone to Trump and he will be right back to his asshole-ery",ScubaSteveEL,2025-04-27T21:17:08,7

"Zelensky, like most European leaders, have learned how to placate Trump. Putin learned first, which is why he got away with so much.  Now that others figured out how to manipulate him, his opinions bounce like a see saw based on who he last spoke with.",muchnycrunchny,2025-04-27T21:55:33,3
"The problem is, the easiest way to stop the war is to end amy and all help to Ukraine. Putin knows this and knows trump doesn't care about peace. He cares about getting a win.   The problem is, it wouldn't be a win for Ukraine. It would be a surrender until the next finishing invasion. As Zelensky said, if we were going to surrender, we can do that without the us.   Zelensky needs to tickle Trump's balls as much as he can. And yes, I hate that that's the case, but Putin has been doing so for years. Let the ego go and play politics.",NATO_Will_Prevail,2025-04-27T21:22:48,2

"One of the things I've had to work through when dealing with dementia in people Trump's age is they're easily swayed to change their opinions and understanding based on the most recent conversation they've had.  They may go from believing they agree with Fox to thinking they never trusted Fox based on the conversational inputs of who they're with.   In a sense, they'll accept it because they really don't know, it's confusing. Tid-bits are there but not enough to piece together.   It's coherent and you may just pass it off as an age thing.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T21:30:15,7
"It's not kompromat.  It's admiration.  Trump wants to be like Putin.  Putin is an autocrat who uses his position to skim money from oligarchs.  In essence, Putin is running a protection racket that has made him one of the world's wealthiest people.  Trump would love to have that as his own legacy.",I405CA,2025-04-27T22:20:05,3
Trying to understand Trump's intentions and the logic behind a highly disordered ego (one that may well be insane) is an exercise that in futility and it's own sort of derangement.    We'd all do well to remember that Trump's mind is operating on the third tail that normally well adjusted minds can't comprehend.,church-rosser,2025-04-27T21:47:22,2

"This was my take too. He was finally in an environment around his ‚Äúpeers‚Äù, other world leaders and he sees them rallying around Zelensky. Now he looks like an idiot. Putin has made him irrelevant to others. Suddenly he is not the big dog, in fact people don‚Äôt even want to shake his hand. No one fears him, yet pities him.",colomboseye,2025-04-28T02:15:34,2
