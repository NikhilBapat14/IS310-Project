"""$6 trillion in tariffs. That'll offset my $5 trillion tax cut. Trust me.""  Now the US is almost $37 trillion in debt. Not counting emergency spending like COVID and ""too big to fail banking bailouts"" 90% of this debt is due to the Party of Fiscal Responsibility, the Republicans, CUTTING TAXES. Like all Americans, they don't like paying their taxes, the difference being they don't like paying their bills. And now they have the ultimate Dead-Beat-in-Chief heading up their party.",YallerDawg,2025-04-12T09:56:19,34

"Probably just means those industries are giving him money or lapping up his balls to get special treatment. Funny the first brand I heard mentioned on this was Apple, when Cook has donated to him then probably asked for a favor after taking a bath on billions in stock value the last weeks because of trump's foolish economic plans...   It is exactly what's happening with everything else.... News and media has to kiss his ass, same with law firms, also states... My republican senator and all the others pass all his bullshit then try to go personally themselves to beg and grovel him for exemptions, protections to stem the bleeding of all the damge it has created... it is so fucking pathetic and corrupt. You better kiss his ring, his ass, and not ever upset him if you want help with ANYTHING...  It also puts them in this position after to act like the heroes that saved whatever tf it was they helped to destroy anyways... Susan Collins already has ads playing saying SHE is fighting for social security, to save medicaid and bring down costs for seniors... EXCUSE ME, WHAT THE SHIT!?!?!?! The only reason it needed saving or protection was because of them in the first place üòë   It is almost like Susan Collins is a security guard at a concert when she sees someone she knows walk in with a rifle saying they wanted to kill everyone. She let's them in, then when people start dying she says ""oh, well I know that guy, maybe I can get him to not kill some people from Maine because he owes me a favor"" it is fucking disgusting!

This is him attempting to make the right people. Rich. This will definitely negatively affect minorities and women. He will remove the tariffs from products that affect white men that are on his side. And it's very difficult to be on his side if you're not a white man.,5050Clown,2025-04-12T15:31:08,1

"Yes. Trump was [""waiting for Xi to call""](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/trump-is-waiting-for-xi-to-call-the-chinese-see-it-differently/ar-AA1CHgUD). Didn't happen.  Trump's strategy this term has been 1) apply pain to somebody, 2) wait for them to suck up, 3) remove pain. That's become his standard strategy for almost everything.  Trump's bullying isn't working at all outside the US:  * Trump tried to bully Ukraine. Zelenskyy stood up to him. EU is now working on ways to become less dependent on the US. **LOSER**. * Trump tried to bully Canada. The ""51st state"" nonsense was laughed at by everybody. Tariff threats made it clear that the US needs Canada's imports more than Canada needs to export to the US. Premier of Canada refused to be bullied. Trump backed down. **LOSER**. Canada and China are now in early discussions about exporting oil to China instead of the US.  * Trump tried to bully Denmark over Greenland. World reaction was laughter. Denmark didn't back down. **LOSER**. Vance visited old US base in Greenland. Accomplished nothing.  * Trump tried to bully the European Union. Not much happened. Trump backed down. **LOSER.** * Trump tried to bully China over tariffs. China mostly ignored him. Trump backed down once told that the US needs China's imports. **LOSER**.  And that's where we are today.",Animats,2025-04-12T13:40:32,20

"Yeah I agree, but nuances like that are incomprehensible to him.
