"To my understanding there is no legal issue preventing the majority from kicking the minority party off committees in general; or at least there's no constitutional issue with it.  The specific rules of the House adopted each session may contain some restrictions, but I haven't heard of any, and they could certainly be changed if the majority were willing to change it.  I'm not sure I'd call it 'courtesy' that they do not do so.  But a form of institutional inertia may apply; there are some rules that have been as they are for a very long time, and there is reluctance to change them.  It's also the case that when misdeeds are done on topics like this, it's often by pushing at the borders rather than by truly blatantly changing things.  So one would want a rationalization and/or allegedly good reason before doing so.  It also means that from a political standpoint, it's safer to do more limited removals like the Republicans did on Omar rather than to take more general action.  It's easier to justify it to themselves, and easier for their base to rationalize, if it's more limited.  There's also of course the fear that the other side will do the same to you, which undoubtedly has some effect.  One simple reason not to remove people is that the majority party already gives itself the majority in each committee generally, so as long as they agree with each other they can already do what they want with the committee.  As such there's far less reason to bother kicking people out regardless of the situation.",zlefin_actual,2023-02-04T17:57:12,3
"Precedent.  The House Majority has always respected the Minority’s choice in representation on committees for the last 234 years until Pelosi started rejecting it in the last session.  Now a bad precedent has been set, and it is hard to go back after it has been broken.",Fargason,2023-02-05T14:21:30,3
I'm interested in that question too.  Commenting here so I can find it later,ImNotASmartManBut,2023-02-04T15:02:19,0
Self-respect?  Kicking all of the minority members off committees would make the majority look ridiculous.,unebaguette,2023-02-04T22:41:31,1
"Technically speaking, nothing at all. The House majority sets the rules, and if they wanted to literally shut out the minority party from all governing, they have the authority to make that choice. Like a few things in government, this is less about what they are technically able to do and more about doing so would be a huge, costly mistake.  Essentially, pursuing this plan would very likely cause severe challenges for the party in the next election cycle. Voters for the most part in this country do not approve of shutting one side completely out of governing, even in cases where one party controls all branches. Up to this point, doing this would be doing something voters very much do not approve of, and that's always scary territory for a politician to navigate. Could that change? Sure, it's possible. It hasn't yet, though.  Also, on a more tactical level, shutting out the opposition completely is a bit of a double edged sword: it means they can't mess things up for you, but it also means they can't effectively be blamed when things aren't perfect. And things are *never* perfect. Does a party really get an advantage in committees they can easily dominate with simple majorities anyway if they can no longer scapegoat?",mormagils,2023-02-06T08:47:54,1
"Omar, Swawell, and Schiff were kicked off their committees for good reason. It wasn’t about them bucking the majority or anything like that. Omar has continuously made anti-Semitic statements throughout her years in Congress. Making her a risk to be in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Swawells assistant/lover for many years while holding office was a Chinese Spy. And Schiff consistently claimed he had “solid proof” of Russia collusion yet never presented it. He also was said to have leaked things from intel meetings to the media. Both National Security risks that shouldn’t be on the Intel Committee .",Psykotik10dentCs,2023-02-04T21:23:09,-7
"I agree on swawell, but the others your position just doesn't hold up to actual scrutiny; instead being based on misrepresentation of the right.  Confusing anti-Israel statement with anti-semitic; buying into the bigotry of the republican party, plus the petty vengefulness and overall poor governance, which is the basis for their removal.  The Mueller report alone provides enough proof on collusion, they just couldn't prove criminal conspiracy.  You're mistaking 'good reason' for 'lies and rationalizations to pretend you have a good reason'.  It's people like you being fooled, or willfully choosing to be blind, that is the cus that enables Republicans to get away with this kind of egregious misconduct.",zlefin_actual,2023-02-05T08:39:03,4
Omar has made multiple anti-Semitic statements over the years. She is vehemently anti-Israel and is not afraid to voice it. She has also likened The US and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. That’s not “buying into bigotry” it is a known fact. She should have been taken off committee along time ago.   Schiff is a lying snake who lied to the American people for years regarding the “intel” he had on “Russia Collusion.” There was no truth to anything he said. This was proven by the Mueller Investigation.  The Mueller Report for there to be NO RUSSIAN COLLUSION. There are multiple reports by several different media sources stating this fact.   https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2019/03/mueller-concludes-investigation/  https://www.npr.org/2019/03/24/706318191/trump-white-house-hasnt-seen-or-been-briefed-on-mueller-investigation-report  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna986611  https://www.politico.com/amp/story/2019/03/24/breaking-news-barr-to-release-summary-of-mueller-report-1233771,Psykotik10dentCs,2023-02-06T10:02:00,-5
"Yyeah, you're straight up lying now.  I'm done.  No point talking to someone who's literally straight up lying about what hte Mueller report said.  Shame on you for supporting fascism and gaslighting.",zlefin_actual,2023-02-06T10:25:30,6
"To be fair, ""collusion"" is not a legal term. Mueller in his report stated that. Page 2 of the Mueller Report:  >In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ""collusion."" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ""collud[e ]"" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.  Page 181 of the Mueller Report, that explicitly said instead of collusion, they were investigating criminal conspiracy, and didn't charge anyone:  >For that reason, this Office's focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term ""collusion."" The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349, 195l(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume  1, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law-including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371 's offenses clause.   So Mueller intentionally did NOT conclude there was no collusion. he did conclude there was no criminal conspiracy.  There definitely WAS collusion (in the common usage of the word) and the Mueller Report did lay out several instances of collusion and attempted collusion in the 2016 campaign.",ProLifePanda,2023-02-07T09:49:31,3
