"People are thinking of the Logan Act, not the Hatch act.  On January 30, 1799, the Logan Act was thus passed by the U.S. Congress to prevent any individual from corresponding with a foreign government without permission from the U.S. government.",Nanyea,2024-06-28T23:06:20,5
"From what I remember digging into the hatch act during the #resist madness a few years ago, the act doesn't apply to cabinet level or above as those are explicitly political positions pushing and espousing policy. The act applies to the unappointed and unelected bureaucratic employees of the federal government as their role is not to push or further their own policy preferences but simply work as a cog in the machine.  Just thinking at it from a top level it would be ridiculous to assert that a presidential or legislative candidate can't push policy positions they would implement if elected. That's like the entire point of elected representation inside government.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-06-28T14:54:26,2

">Just thinking at it from a top level it would be ridiculous to assert that a presidential or legislative candidate can't push policy positions they would implement if elected.  They didn't assert that, read it again. ""Trump said he would end the war in Ukraine ***before*** taking office.""  That noted, it does not appear the Hatch Act covers actions of private citizens, which Trump is at the moment. Any action on Ukraine by a private citizen would probably fall under the [Logan Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act), however.",wyrmfood,2024-06-28T15:17:16,3
"You guys are thinking of the Logan Act (see my comment).  Hatch Act applies to the entire exec branch except the President and VP, this includes cabinet members... Couple dipshits got in trouble last few admins over it (including Trump's admin and Obama's).",Nanyea,2024-06-28T23:07:57,1
"Its probably more a Logan Act issue as you mentioned, but there is some ""uniqueness"" to the ""[Office of the President-Elect](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0002659/)"" (as Obama put it during that transition period) and what would be applicable under the Logan Act  1. The Lame Duck Period essentially is the winding down of the President's policies and aims (and usually a rush to get a few checked off!) and the winding *up* of the President-Elect so that their policies and aims can hit the ground running on [inauguration day](https://www.usa.gov/inauguration#:~:text=Inauguration%20Day%20occurs%20every%20four,be%20on%20January%2020%2C%202025.) (January 20, 2025 in this case) 2.  Even before this, during the campaign the President-Elect would have laid out their policy goals, in this case for foreign policy, in broad strokes.  During this time, we'd see more of those details come out, such as naming Cabinet members, spit-balling ambassadors, meeting with foreign leaders they'll be working with (or against!), etc. 3. And finally, the point of the Logan Act is to prohibit private citizens from negotiation against the goals of the government.  It becomes this weird little chicken/egg argument of ""well, you don't want to screw up the final months of one administration"" but also ""you don't want to set back the first months of the next"".  Most likely, even with the animosity between the candidates and the parties, Biden would work with Trump if Trump truly wanted to try and negotiate something with Ukraine.  Because if Biden looks at Trump's deal and realizes it might work, why not claim half the credit (""I helped Trump negotiate peace"") than waiting two months and getting none?  Even if you thought it might blow up in Trump's face, Biden could allow it and then blame it blowing up on Trump too.  Or at least try, if he could pull it off politically.",AuditorTux,2024-06-28T15:41:08,4
