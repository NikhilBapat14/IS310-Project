"They are going to end up politicizing autism diagnoses as a means to jail opposition, watch.  RFK already wants a national registry of autism patients and has talked about putting them in work camps.",CrashB111,2025-04-23T23:49:07,48
Because the cause is just going to be vaccines.  So they don't need to do actual research when they already have their scapegoat ready.,crestroncp3user,2025-04-23T23:59:41,28

"RFK said that they'll ""know the cause"" by September I think. If he intends to say vaccines are the cause in advance, why research anything between now and then?  Disgusting.",One-With-Many-Things,2025-04-24T00:08:36,6

Not a single mention of the registry or anything RFK has said about this on the conservative sub.   Guess they haven't found a way to spin this yet.,act17,2025-04-24T03:33:47,2
"That is just silly. Trump's people are not planning to do *research* to discover the cause. That costs money and risks a politically worthless or damaging answer.   They are going to pick an answer they like that they think they can massage the data to support. Cheap, tidy, and easily abused.",TaltosDreamer,2025-04-24T05:16:14,2
"I have two genetic conditions that were once viewed as diseases that only happened to people when they got old. The first condition hit me before I was in my mid twenties and the other condition hit me in my mid thirties. There‚Äôs a chance I could need a second surgery for the second condition, in a few years. With being familiar with genetic illnesses, I feel scared for autistic people. The lies being spread about autism is so concerning. Times are scary.",SimthingEvilLurks,2025-04-24T04:55:51,2

"How does this goverment think this works..  you can't say ""i'm gonna find out the cause of autism""( even though it's not viral) and then not fund it..  that's like ""i'm gonna buy another car"" and then spend it in the stripclub..   Either they don't communicate with each other , or they are even dumber than i thought.",Strict-Pain5154,2025-04-24T02:12:19,1
Almost like the whole idea from RFK was nonsense and he was just gonna blame vaccines all along üôÑ,LabRat_X,2025-04-24T09:38:22,1
Where is all the money from these cuts going? I don't get it. Doge layoffs and constant research cuts yet this administration's spending has not decreased.... What are they still spending just as much money on?,No-Bus-1214,2025-04-24T08:45:49,0
"RFK doesn‚Äôt have the political capital to do anything as draconian as people suggest. They‚Äôre just gonna discourage getting diagnosed so the numbers go down, and they can claim they‚Äôre solving it. Same with Covid. Same with bird flu.",subtle_bullshit,2025-04-24T00:15:28,-7

Wow... A financial cost comparison on these with spreadsheet/grid with dates and links to confirmation of cut/spending  would be worth viewing. I saw something about an actual golden cherub in one of the rooms in the Whitehouse (please fact check)...
