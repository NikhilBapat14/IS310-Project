So do it again. And keep fucking doing it until you get it. What is this quitter crap?  And Democrat voters think more of this weakness is what we need in office? Unbelievable.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-03T00:21:20,3

"I’m gonna sound like a conspiracy theorist here but: they deliberately sabotaged the vote. They *want* Trump to cause a recession because they think it’ll get them back into power in ‘26. It’s either that or they fucked it up, and quite frankly I don’t think Chuck Schumer is that stupid. He’s a lot of things, but an idiot is not one of them.   The Democrats’ whole strategy since 2016 has been banking on voters’ fear of Trump, they are totally disinterested in doing anything outside of that. Advocating for stuff is hard and risks pissing off the donors. “Trump bad” is easy.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-05-02T19:54:52,5

That is the point. To set up conflict between Trump and Republicans. A passed bill forces him to veto. Now they don't have to deal with that.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-03T01:11:48,2
