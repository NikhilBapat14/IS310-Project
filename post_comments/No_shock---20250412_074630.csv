"I'm as pro-trans and anti-measles as the next guy, but considering trans atheletes by themselves, it makes sense to ask questions - sports and gender are (for some reason) really important to people, and trans atheletes kind of dismantle all the previous sport conventions. Before the dawn of gender anxiety (which is less recent than I thought) testosterone wasn't an issue, the conventions were not questioned. Now people treat themselves with hormones and want to compete. Can this work as it has in the past? It seems to me that it can't, and that the inclusion of trans atheletes is necessarily a part of the attack on the gender binary.

"I give you the fact that preventable harm could have been avoided but I can also bring up new nih.gov studies that actually that has followed patients who have undergone gender affirming care and reported increased mental health issues and I can say from a person who struggles with depression. One of the biggest causes of depression is knowing that you will forever be dependent on the big Pharma industry, which is relatable to those who now are obliged to undergo hormone therapy for the rest of their life in order to fit the ideology of their gender, which has a high likelihood of causing anxiety, if and when access to those therapies are either not covered by insurance Medicaid or one cannot afford to live under the control of big Pharma. It’s a sad dilemma, both for mental health and for the people who have gone through this process and now stuck with the system. I have no objections to the process once a person has become fully developed in their prefrontal cortex at the age of 21 or if I wanna come more to the center, say 18 but for children, I think it’s kind of wrong it can have some severe and negative impacts on their lives for the rest of their life.",Otherwise_Tiger3760,2025-04-12T20:22:55,0

"I also think a step in the right direction would not be protesting things it would be coming up with a solution to address the rights of these people because currently these people have rights as men and women and to amend that process legislation is needed to give them rights without limiting the rights already created for both men and women it seems silly, but without legislation changes,  proper legislation cannot lead to long-standing change. If you engage in discrimination by allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports, women are being discriminated through legislation that is meant to fight against discrimination. If trans athletes don’t have enough people to form their own division rationally. Why not make a division of athletes of males that rank in the same merit as the trans athletes to make a fair system. The other argument you could evaluate is if you apply the equality of gender standards across the board, but then disagree that men and women should be held to the same standard for military participation.

And I said that because u act like im some country club wealthy white person lol but it’s not just people on the right it’s women who have fought so much to have the rights they have today. The tax break that they are trying to accomplish is maintaining the current tax rate for everyone and create better tax rates to grow the economy and reduce the cost of consumer goods. As well as bringing foreign investment into America to create growth.  If there is evidence out thee through the entire history of the world where high taxes benefits the poor in the greatest way then provide it to me. What I can tell you is that through history overtaxation usually leads to slower economic growth which in turn leads to financial instability in the long run.,Otherwise_Tiger3760,2025-04-13T11:36:19,1
Here’s the thing if they’re minding their own business they would respect that in free societies everyone has equal opportunity and rights as so long as they do not infringe on another’s rights which is my point it’s not about transgender it’s about infringing on the equal rights women have fought for since ancient history.,Otherwise_Tiger3760,2025-04-13T11:41:12,1

"Actually increasing corporate tax incentives businesses to compensate for the increase in taxes. Whether that be outsourcing manufacturing, passing the tax increase onto the consumer, or completely moving the company to a country with lower taxes and less regulation. In that case cheaper labor comes with that move. Now global trade may affect what country a corporation may move to based on what their business is but please  explain to me how higher taxes doesn’t hurt jobs. In fact if you want to learn about Chinese tax policies I think you might have a better understanding how taxation on corporations affects economic growth. I do not take a hard right approach to where taxation is used because it is critical to stimulate economic growth with our tax money but there are many ways to generate revenue for the federal government to stimulate economic growth.",Otherwise_Tiger3760,2025-04-13T13:08:13,1
No definitely not but a woman has at least the philosophical views that address rights and politics everyone is equally entitled to some inherent rights bound by nature and one of them in my view is privacy in say a bathroom if a ftm came into the males restroom and I was at a urinal with no privacy I would feel a bit uncomfortable i can’t speak for women but I would imagine in a locker room this could happen. That’s why establishing the right for transgender people to have their own restroom or changing the way a restroom is created so that each person can have a private space seems reasonable I would say the same about lockerooms it’s not that people need to be excluded but rather everyone utilizing these type of facilities should have the right to be able to shower and change in a private space that is actually inclusive because then the freedom of choice is respected for transgender people while respecting the right for a woman to choose a private changing room. But with sports it’s a bit more complicated gender is a psychological theory where natural science gender is not it is determined with certainty by our genetic makeup.,Otherwise_Tiger3760,2025-04-13T12:32:49,1
It’s not a belief it’s actually based in philosophical theory which has to be widely accepted to be considered a theory.
