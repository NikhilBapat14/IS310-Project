"Time to hold him accountable then.  If you can't, even if he loses power, you will still be a joke and there's nothing stopping another one of him from getting into power.  But it's clear that your congress doesn't care enough to stop it. The corruption is deep and you'll need to remove it all to protect your democracy. This will involve removing politicians from office forever and actually putting all these traitors to justice.  Will you actually do that? I doubt it. You're still too afraid to act against it.",TemperateStone,2025-04-17T11:08:53,6

"I see all these people all over the internet who are so knowledgeable about the United States government and how it works and go on TikTok or Youtube preaching about how horrible it is what Trump is doing, some with millions of views and hundreds of thousands of followers and I can't help but ask the question: If these people know so much, if they care so much, why aren't they in politics trying to stop this stuff themselves? In addition to informing people like this, not instead of doing this, to be clear. Especially since they have the exposure needed to get some traction towards winning elections.  Be the change you want to see.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-17T16:04:59,2
Such a hypocrite. He said that he would protect and uphold the constitution.,Legal-Freedom8179,2025-04-17T15:37:18,1
"This man has both great points and great taste in dress socks.  The video they showed of the 60s protests in front of the Washington Monument and then cut to one of the recent protests in the same place for basically another version of civil rights was extremely powerful. It put a lump in my throat and goes to show u that street protests really do send an incredible message that endure the test of time. Even if u weren’t American, it’d be easy to see who was right and who was wrong in those old videos",Cody-512,2025-04-18T00:30:38,1

"Dred Scott v. Sandford held the U.S. Constitution did not extend American citizenship to people of black African descent.  The dissent called it legally and historically baseless, pointing out that at the time of the Constitution's adoption black men could vote in five of the 13 states.  An objectively bad decision by the Supreme Court does not transform the Constitution.  It can alter what the government claims is constitutional, but it does not change the words of the Constitution.",SpockShotFirst,2025-04-17T08:13:02,8

">If you can't, even if he loses power, you will still be a joke and there's nothing stopping another one of him from getting into power.  That's the biggest thing to come from all of this. Even if Trump doesn't figuratively if not literally tear up the Constitution on national TV and declare himself King for Life and thus we still have a democracy four years down the line, he's massively weakened our rights and Constitution regardless. In fact, if he doesn't, it'll even further weaken the Constitution because when the next nutjob shows up to actually tear up the Constitution people won't take it seriously because ""Trump didn't do it, this guy won't do it either.""  Unless the very next Democratic president (because let's face it, the Republicans aren't even going to pretend to do this) that gets in immediately starts relentlessly pushing out bills, executive orders, and amendments on day one specifically to prevent the very blatant abuses of power that Trump has been rapid firing like a machine gun since his first day in office, we'll just be here again a few years later, praying the next Trump doesn't destroy our government out of spite.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-17T16:05:52,2
