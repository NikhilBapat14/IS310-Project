"Right on brand for the GOP: This is the 'jingle keys' equivalent of distracting an infant and their supporters will eat it up.  No money for medical research, no money for education, no money to feed the hungry, no money to help the homeless, no money for veterans, no money for anything that actually helps people....but all the time and money to renaming a body of water.  The ""Gulf of America"" does nothing for America. It benefits no one. It creates no jobs. It generates no money. It makes the US look weak and petty on the world stage. Republicans proving yet again they're unwilling, unqualified, and utterly incapable of running a functioning government.",Boring_Investment597,2025-05-08T09:20:05,12
">Its fate in the Senate is more of a challenge, given that it will need bipartisan cooperation to overcome a filibuster.  Meaning Trump's horseshit has no chance.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-08T09:13:02,12
Surely there are more important things that need to be dealt with. What a complete waste of time this is just to appease a president with malignant narcissism,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-08T09:40:48,2
I'd LMAO if a hurricane hits the gulf coast states and insurance companies refuse to pay because the storm came from the Gulf of America which insurance companies do not recognize.,mkt853,2025-05-08T09:48:37,2

"It actually divides and outrages a lot of Americans who live along the Gulf of Mexico and have called it that their entire lives.  It annoys, irritates and inflames our historical foreign allies and trading partners, particularly Mexico, even though internationally it will still be known as the Gulf of Mexico.  It will just cause more division and disagreement between and amongst Americans and our foreign allies.",Normal_Attitude_5148,2025-05-08T09:33:55,10

"Also, no pushback on Trump deciding that the Executive branch can decide what money to spend where. That's explicitly a Legislative power which they are completely abdicating.",jaxonfairfield,2025-05-08T09:32:09,8

"It's almost like he wants to offend the USA's 3rd largest export market Mexico ($334 billion), after the European Union (EU) and Canada ($349 billion).  It's like he intentionally wants to piss off our largest export markets.",Normal_Attitude_5148,2025-05-08T12:00:04,2

"I’m sure in his mind the countries will blindly pay the tariffs that he gets to skim off the top of and they wouldn’t just pass the cost on to the consumer, like they are doing. Tariffs can work IF you have the means to mass produce/mass manufacture everything in-house, but as the US doesn’t it’s just making poor people poorer",Philhughes_85,2025-05-08T12:35:26,1
