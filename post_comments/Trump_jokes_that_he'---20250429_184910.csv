It's a bit funny that a subset of his religious base thinks the pope is by definition the antichrist within their preferred theologic interpretation.  I'd love to see how they'd react just for Its own sake.,steve_ample,2025-04-29T18:56:54,8

Exactly. People said he was joking when he wanted to be President. Then when he wanted to run again after losing. Now with the third term. And the pope talk.   He’s a narcissist. He thinks he’s the best candidate to do ANYTHING. He thinks he knows more about everything than anyone who has ever lived.   Stop giving him a pass and just call it like it is.,Syronxc,2025-04-29T19:01:17,20

"[The papacy has a thousand year history of corruption, cruelty and sex abuse](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/europe/catholic-church-most-controversial-popes/index.html). He would make a perfect Pope. Pope Alexander, a Borgia:  TIME IN POWER: 1492-1503.  WHAT HE DID: To this day, the Borgia name is synonymous with scandal because of this guy’s rule. (How many other papal families have a Showtime series named after them?)  There was controversy from the start with Pope Alexander VI, a wealthy Spaniard who allegedly bought the papacy by bribing his fellow electors.  Alexander also saw no problem appointing many of his relatives to positions of power, or killing off rival cardinals to claim their valuable property for himself.  And he was apparently quite the ladies’ man, fathering several children with his many mistresses.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-04-30T14:35:35,1
