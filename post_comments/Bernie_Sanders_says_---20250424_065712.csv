"No one talks about the biggest issue today that lead to the failure of the Democratic Party. The absolute onslaught of lies, propaganda and fake news. How do we deal with this? For example I watched Fox News cover the Kilmar case, they called him a gang member and a terrorist. They didn’t mention the Supreme Court decision or lack of due process. I think we need to start suing the pants off these organizations and these “journalists”. You want to lie about post birth abortions. There needs to be harsh legal recourse for this.",johndoe4sho,2025-04-24T10:39:04,296

"I'm thinking about when Kamala Harris pitched a benefit for first-time homeowners - and then added to the campaign pitch that it would only be for people who had paid their rent on time for two years, and would be smaller if you weren't a first-generation homeowner.   *Why would you say that?* It's not like this is a bill that's been through committee and all, so no one knows what the eligibility rules will end up being. So why would you make a big populist promise in a way that prompts large numbers of people to think ""well never mind, fuck me then""?   If they want to win (something I am not always sure of), Democrats need to offer a lot more ""you, personally, will get value for your tax dollars"" and a lot less ""don't worry, we won't spend your tax dollars on unworthy mooches such as yourself.""",pervocracy,2025-04-24T07:25:25,753

"Gotta keep in mind a good portion of the working class believed the lie about Haitians were eating pets and think trans people are making women and the sports men carved out for them disappear.  Can’t say people aren’t listening if we aren’t hearing what they’re actually saying.  The Democrats lost, but the maga christofashos won with the red lining Birther at the top of the ticket.  Don’t let them hide behind “economic anxiety” while they’re winning the reds with ads calling Kamala Harris a communist and wearing the average voter down with “I’m tired of both sides arguing about culture war (civil rights/social safety nets/environmental conservation issues usually) stuff”.  I’ve heard so many rational people say they don’t like unions and they don’t like paying for other people’s children. Keep that in mind too.  And oh my gosh guys the mind fuck goes deeper because a lot of folks think this is a Christian nation although they’ve probably never read the Bible and now that the Jesus that they’ve been lied to about all these years is “too woke” they don’t like him anymore but hilariously enough that lines up fine with the actual Abrahamic god of the Bible because he’s  a racist, slaving, genocidal, misogynistic, gaslighting whackadoo.   This is in addition to generations, in their holy houses, being “groomed” since the 1930s by oligarchs and church fathers to associate anything *New Deal progressive or needing to raise taxes for it* with satanic godlessness.   It took a while to get here, and they may not have thought it would be Trump, but the rightwing fear generator “paid off”.   For some of us, social issues aren’t existential made up “identity politics” and the right always wins on identity politics when they do win and we just come in later to “politically correct” it by calling it moral majority economic anxiety or something like that for them.

It’s not that Bernie isn’t right, the dems do need to take a more social approach to their policies and find solutions to alleviate working class and middle class issues.   BUT.

Yeah I don’t agree on this.  I think Democrats HAVE been listening to the working class but the working class doesn’t want to listen to the Democrats.  Right wing propaganda has spent decades demonizing the Democrats as devils and a large part of the working class seems to believe that so no matter what the Dems say or try to do to help them they don’t believe it.

"Just because people are working class, that does not mean that they base their votes on working class issues.  Look, I really do like Bernard. But one of my long-standing gripes with him has been that he consistently tries to paper over the poor behavior of white working class voters with economic excuses.  Yes, the pain of the working class is real but it's not like that's the key thing driving their voting behavior.  Biden was the most pro-union president in decades. He stewarded a recovery where lowest wage workers had the strongest wage growth. walked picket lines with union workers. He also passed major pro-manufacturing bills, protected Teamsters' pensions, worked behind-the-scenes on getting better sick leave for rail workers, etc. He forgave student loans and slashed insulin prices. He gave Bernie a [seat at the table](https://www.afscme.org/blog/saunders-named-to-economic-task-force-set-up-by-biden-sanders) and did most of the things Bernie suggested.  Harris was going to give tax credits to first-time homebuyers and to small business owners. She was going to make home health care affordable for seniors.  And yet these working class white people instead chose someone who is going to demolish unions, dismantle the safety net, undercut worker protections, and otherwise change their lives for the worse.  Maybe Bernie understandably wants to distance himself from Kamala's failing brand of Democrats. And I get that.   But he needs to take stock of the fact that Biden/Harris took heed of much of his advice and it still didn't deliver these white working class voters. And maybe it is a big messaging problem, but that does not mean Dems didn't listen to the working class.  So maybe he should at least entertain the fact that other factors might be at play.",Infidel8,2025-04-24T11:08:14,10

"No, no Bernie.  You just don't understand the American Dream. John Steinbeck said it best:  >Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.  This is why we defend them.  Because we believe that if we work hard enough, we will be like them just as they worked hard to get their due.  Bernie's message does not vibe with the American Dream.  Of course the irony is if it's just hard work, Zuck, Bezos, and others would be able to recreate their success.  Because it is very re-creatable and repeatable.  So as a social experiment, let's have a one-time wealth tax and see if they are able to work hard to do it again, needing to accumulate capital again.  Because they already have the talent and network.  In fact, we are not taking anything away from them in taxing their wealth.

How do Democrats, like Republicans, that are fed billions of lobbyist/donor $$ to benefit themselves and their corporations, actually help the working class?  Our voting system is under constant attack and there are numerous districts around the country where voters have no choice due to gerrymandering - from both parties.  It's been said that money is the root of all evil and nothing could be more true as it relates to our entire political system. The most glaring problem in the US is that the people can't be truly heard because they are being drowned out by all the money in the government campaign system.  Our politicians are bought and paid for by the highest bidder for the purpose of putting forth legislation that benefits them.  The Supreme Court is Conservative - which means they lean more heavily toward the rights of Corporate America; and, Citizens United will never be overturned because of judges like Thomas and Alito that take questionable, unreported kickbacks from wealthy corporate donors.  I don't always agree with Bernie and AOC, but they are right - our rich politicians and wealthy donors are destroying the lives of the average working class American - the hard workers that bust knuckles daily - only to feed the folks that are quietly destroying us.

In the 2024 campaign, look at how much time and money the republicans spent on ads attacking Kamala Harris’s LGBTQ+ positions vs how little time and money she actually spent talking about lgbtq+ issues. I can’t remember Kamala ever choosing to talk about trans rights, for example, unless someone asked her a direct question, and the DNC rejected any trans rights speakers for their convention.   Conservatives reframe the debate in such a way that democrats are stuck with three choices, all of them bad for winning votes.   If democrats  agree with conservatives on these issues (like they used to with being anti-gay marriage), they will lose liberal and far left votes. If they double down and fight harder on these issues, they won’t gain many more left/liberal votes but will lose centrist votes.

">Basically “this is what you get because you’re Australian” no means-tested garbage for things like healthcare or any of their election pitches. Everyone gets it.  The conservative media poisoned this idea in a few ways.  The most clever was talking about ""entitlement"" programs, which is accurate in terms of public policy jargon.  We have a lot of entitled (in the sense of being a self important jerk) people in our society, and it was an easy leap to extend the meaning of the word.  The second way was by claiming that illegal immigrants were using these programs, which they aren't.  In fact, they pay Social Security but will never collect it.  There are social costs like emergency medical care, but that's not what they scream about.    The underlying root problem is simply racism.  A huge percentage of our country would be very happy with ""healthcare for everyone except black people"".  They would rather deny themselves proper care than give it to blacks.

As with my original point, those who suffer more as a result of the decision America made in November are the people in Gaza, not the Democrats.   Anyone who really cared about Gaza would have voted for the option which was clearly less bad for Gaza, which was, very obviously, the Democrats.   Any claim to the contrary isn't about actual results on the ground for the people of Gaza, it's about people salving their own conscience by opting out altogether.

Nobody with broad appeal will ever acknowledge the gist of what white working class voters really want: all the benefits they had before, but a chance to exclude everyone else from what they themselves enjoy. That exact issue sums up every single poll that shows broad, widespread support for issues (unbranded by political party) that we normally consider to be liberal or progressive - Republicans voters are happy to receive assistance, government funded infrastructure, good government jobs, healthcare, environmental protection, strong schools, etc - but only if only they benefit from those things. Otherwise, as history has shown, they'll shutter any institution that black people and brown people and LGBTQ+ and disabled and ""undesirable"" people want to use. They bulldozed brand new hospitals and schools in the South that were built by the New Deal to be unsegregated, they incorporate themselves out of the city they live in to deny their tax money to the nonwhite citizens of those cities, etc.    The message I keep hearing is that if Dems want to win the white working class, they have to essentially court them, and exclude everyone else.

">>A nanny state is getting unemployment Bud. Especially since it’s coming from someone else’s taxes.             Sorry, you're not making sense because in order to get unemployment insurance you need to work and you pay into it. It's not going to people that don't pay into it. It's also time limited & not given out in most cases unless you lost your job for very specific reasons, without it being your fault. So how are you claiming it's ""coming from someone else's taxes"" if it's coming directly from the people that have jobs & no one else?           Maybe you're claiming unemployment insurance is like every social benefit (like food stamps, SSA, welfare, etc) but that's just ridiculous if you are when every program has it's own stipulations.  I feel like you're comment is a good example of why Americans feel so cheated when talking about social safety nets -- it's a lack of understanding how they work or where they come from in the first place. Like musk targeting ssi/ ssdi -- there's no mass ""tax payer waste/ fraud"" for a program where the people receiving said benefits, were directly paying into it to even qualify. No paying into it? You don't get it.             And yuck with the whole thing about means testing too with the bs drug tests and whatever for a lousy few hundred bucks a week, AGAIN YOU PAID FOR OUT OF YOUR CHECKS TO HAVE INSURANCE, for a lousy 6 mos max. Whenever they've pulled that nanny state bs with people, it's backfired & cost society way more. Florida learned it real quick with welfare. They spent more money chasing people around, hounding them over pennies, than whatever ""fraud"" they thought they'd find. It was almost nothing.              I just don't get the mentality of not having safety nets for people struggling. Why would you want to live anywhere that has no support at all? Why would you want to watch your sick, elderly, down on their luck types, orphans, etc., die hungry in the streets? Meanwhile rarely is there an outcry about the biggest fraud -- companies having the taxpayers support their employees, or get tax breaks for nothing, while they use OUR infrastructure, our economy, etc., making billions. It's the biggest scam ever. Unlike unemployment insurance, they didn't pay anything in either to be entitled to half the perks they get. Companies that only exist because the TAXPAYERS paved the way with their tax funds, like creating the Internet, but here we are, being scammed for some of the 💩 Internet connections in the world, from companies that act like they invented it.        ",Internal-War-9947,2025-04-25T16:35:24,1

"Oh boy, your post is really scary to read. Because it shows how many people on our side are so out of touch that they don't even understand what Republicans are selling to the electorate, much less how's it's working.  People in America have hated the status quo for decades. I would argue every election since the 1980s, the more anti-establishment candidate was the winner. The root cause of this dislike is economic and tied to inequality and the death of labor in the US--Nixon and Reagan essentially killed the American economy and we've been scavenging its decaying corpse ever since. The last two successful Dem presidents (Bill Clinton and Obama) ran as anti-establishment outsiders on economic change platforms and they won. Every other Dem has, for bizarre reasons, positioned themselves as pro-establishment defenders of the status quo while not acknowledging the clear issues stemming from income inequality. We don't acknowledge the grievance and have been almost exclusively running coastal lawyers turned Washington insiders. Republicans do recognize the grievance and weaponize it against us, especially while running anti-establishment outsiders. Aside from Romney, who was maybe the mathematically worst choice they could've gone with in 2012.   That's what they've been running on for *decades*. The social messaging is also very important here because it sets up a ""regular folk with everyday problems vs out-of-touch Washington elites who know nothing about your struggles and only care about their social causes"" narrative. They bait us into brawling about social issues so they can turn around and say ""look, this is all Dems care about"". And it works every time because we don't actually have an economic platform or any vision we sell. Republicans' economic talk is all snake oil stuff, but they have an actual (scam) product they're trying to sell. And we have jack shit beyond a bunch of dry, coastal elite, low-charisma bureaucrats defending the status quo.  It terrifies me that people on our side do not understand this. Because we've been losing harder and harder to this same trap the entire 21st century--aside from when Obama ran against the party as a dark horse against the pro-establishment candidate the party favored. This dynamic should've been obvious more than two decades ago, and it's only gotten more unignorable with each financial crisis, where inequality gets worse and QoL for regular working folk gets irreversibly worse each time. If we as a party do not recognize this dynamic and provide the electorate some sort of vision forward, we will keep losing forever. Because nobody likes Republicans, but we as a party look like we do not understand the assignment.

Biden should have been merciless under the law against former Trump personnel and should have never appointed Merrik Garland. He waited two years to appoint a special council to investigate Trump.  The GOP took advantage of this and even though the GOP is many orders of magnitudes of more corrupt, they used their media machine to convince a sufficient portion of the populations that Dems were the corrupt ones.  The Dems own lack of executing aggressively on justice further fed into the GOP narrative that they were just playing games and were corrupt.  I originally said status quo candidate but it really wasn’t much Harris could do upon thinking about it more. The election was probably already lost before Harris became the prospective nominee.

Democrats abandoned key provisions of the ACA when they had 59 senate seats and a massive house majority to placate insurers.  Those are two glaring examples.

"Get their base to stop the rhetoric against Republicans.   Be better with the details on hand when addressing or responding to Republican criticism. As in present a specific example in each rhetoric that is specific to that elected rep.  So every time they open their mouth they’re exposing themselves to a mistake they made in their own riding. And do it on X (allow replies but don’t read them, Musk doesn’t, X is for tweeting only nobody cares about the replies.)  Every time Trump makes a statement, point out on X why it does not work for HIS BASE, for Maga, from the Maga perspective.   (The press needs to make it visual, a story for instance on how specific Kentucky families who were laid off from a Liquor plant due to tariffs would actually hit Republicans really hard on national TV).  Republicans respond to individual stories that provide irrefutable proof via camera feeds. So the Democrats need to get in there and start interviewing the people who are directly affected by Trump, who voted for Trump, and who are Maga, or at the very least Republicans.  Drop the contentious issues from policy. If ALL Biden was trying to do was run the economy then he never would have lost the election, but he did a lot more then that.  Drop contentious policy from platforms. You think it’s stupid when the Republicans run with an anti-abortion mandate, and they agree. They hid that and implemented it very nefariously which was permitted by the Democrats at every step of the way!. Why then was Kamila running with DEI policy when it has poor support?  If it’s not supported don’t run with it. Why run with anything that is outside of Government mandates and reduce your chances of election.  It’s not as if the progressive have anyone else to vote for, so cater to the middle.  They need to drop absolute explanations. In Canada inflation was blamed on Covid shipping, and then on CEO’s gouging, but it was primarily driven by immigration.  The gov, like the CEO’s hid behind a Covid excuse to implement policy that created inflation. They lied, by lying they undermined their own voice. Just answer questions like a scientist, nothing is certain everything is apparent. When the right hears something that has no wiggle room their mind literally identifies it as manipulation.  They need to see the good news and the bad news, and they will never believe that there is no bad news, so present it. Don’t hide anything from a Republican, it leads to instant mistrust.  Democrats undermined themselves again when they were found to implement DEi policy (which is partisan) into Government Departments that are legislated to be bipartisan for the specific reason that those departments need to operate across ALL Jurisdictions in the US. They undermined the operation of the departments so that Republicans no longer trust their operations. And look what happened. This all occurred once before, the reason why the law says that those departments need to be bipartisan is to prevent this outcome. So maybe the Dems need to hire a historian to avoid repeating mistakes.   And above all, everything they do needs to be focused on repairing that divide with as many republicans as they can.

"> Here in the US, I know plenty of people who are barely making ends meet but make too much to be eligible for food stamps.  Yeah, the income requirements are absurdly low. In my state it's 200% of the federal poverty level, which for a family of 4 comes in at around $60k/year. Make $61k? Sorry, no benefits even though you literally can't afford to live. There's no where to rent that's less than $2,000/month for a family, and if you buy now with rates and prices what they are, you are going to be paying close to $4000+/month for your mortgage. Not to mention transportation cost, utilities, etc.  Even for a single person, the cutoff for SNAP is $31k/year. That's less than minimum wage. So someone who works full time minimum wage doesn't qualify for any benefits, but also literally can't afford basic needs here. Median rent is $2,026. Someone making $20/hour here full time is going to spend their entire paycheck on rent.   The federal poverty level needs updated, but even better would be to just stop means testing, or put pressure on wages to increase.   To live where I do, and not be paycheck-to-paycheck, a family of 4 effectively needs to make close to $170,000/year. Good luck with that when there's still occupations, outside of tech, that require degrees but pay $60k if you're lucky. Want to be comfortably middle class here? You better be bringing in at least $200k/year.  *edit* means testing the programs also keeps people in poverty, because you're better off that way.

"The booming economy that increased wealth disparity? A GI Bill that had bipartisan support? Increasingly expensive college education (conjoined with a devaluation of non-college educated workers)?  That same economy went tits up 7 years later. The booming wealth left behind millions of Americans and poverty in the western world plummeted in the 90s.  I was alive for the Clinton years. Hell and some of Reagan.  Clinton's deregulation, racial dogwhistling, and broad consensus poisoned the brain of the Democratic party and is still manifested today.  I'm not saying Clinton was a bad president. Nor was Obama. They were centrist consensus builders who unequivocally pulled the Democratic party further right and has continued a slow destruction of the 20th century party that actually stood for the poor.  Every piece of legislation you listed could have gone much further but was curtailed by either donor class interests or this weird fetishization of bipartisanship.  Republicans have remade the courts, slashed taxes (with Democrats help), and ensconsed draconian voter ID laws and control more state legislative seats with each election.  My point is democrats are continuing to pursue electoral wins while the on-the-ground reality for the bottom earning 40% of Americans has not substantially improved.  I teach in and volunteer in Jackson, Mississippi. I work with the core of the Democratic base. I'm telling you point blank Democrats will continue losing the long-term game for the occasional watered down win if they continue pursuing centrist policies that don't tangibly benefit the working class.

">Obama actually did deliver much of what he promised. He still got punished for it.  Okay, I love Obama. My time working as '08 campaign staff was amazing, it defined the course of my life, and I'm immensely proud of what we accomplished. But he completely failed to deliver or massively underdelivered on all of his flagship promises.  Pulling us out of wars in the ME? Closing Gitmo? Solving health insurance? High-speed rail? Or his early priority on affordable housing (tbf he had to discard that one very early)? Nope. He became the drone strike president, Gitmo is still in use, he appointed a bloodthirsty Kissinger acolyte as SecState, he let Rahm talk him into bailing out the banks with basically no consequences or oversight, and his health insurance plan was just a reskinned Heritage Foundation/Romneycare project that empowered health insurance companies in exchange for harm reduction and kicked the problem down the road.  We can debate how much is his fault given the highly obstructionist GoP. But that changes blame, not whether he delivered. And as much as I love the guy, he's one of the worst underdeliverers I'm aware of in political history. Though weirdly, he was a better Bush than Bush. Similar to how Clinton was a better Reagan than Reagan in many ways.  >Clinton delivered on most of his promises as well. It’s because he moved to the middle that he was able to do that.  Clinton's an interesting case because so much of what he ran on was separate from his literal promises. He ran heavily on anti-elite populism framed around Reagan's plutocratic predations. But what he actually deployed was in many ways the exact opposite--his form of neoliberalism was Reagnism 2.0, this time with extra sax. So he did what he said he'd do at a policy-level, but the opposite of what so many people supported him for. Though it took a few years for the effects to fully hit, so there was a bit of separation between Clinton's campaign and Clinton's consequences (Reagan benefitted similarly).  Both Clinton and Obama ran on change platforms. It's basically impossible for a change platform to actually deliver, and I think every politically savvy person knew it even then. But the whole country is desperately hungry for change and has been for decades--to the point that the more anti-establishment, change-focused candidate has won every election since the 1980s.  Really goes to show that you've always had to sell a big vision if you want to attract voters that don't follow things at a detailed policy level.

Kamala wasn’t a complete “no change, only status quo” candidate, but her messaging really didn’t win people over.

"That precise situation is why I'm so incredulous about the idea that Democrats are just controlled opposition and they don't really want these policies. Yeah sure, some of them don't, but the truth is that the Democrats have rarely had the numbers to implement these ideas in the first place. Over the last ***30 years*** Democrats only controlled the White House and Congress (Edit:) at the same time for ***four years***. Of course they can't get anything done!  There's been no sustained continuity of leadership by the Democratic party. No opportunity to build on anything. Every time they take office they're busy undoing the damage that the Republicans had just done.  Too many people ignore the realities of our political system. People don't elect enough Democrats to get anything done and then blame the Democrats for getting nothing done. It's a vicious cycle. Instead of seeing these as obstacles that we still need to overcome, they classify it as ""excuses"" while ignoring the massive impacts of things like the filibuster and the spoiler effect.  Democrats only had a super majority for a matter of days and they put all of that effort into passing the ACA, but apparently they should have also codified Roe v. Wade and done a dozen other things in that time too.  More recently people saw a 50/50 split in the Senate with Harris as a potential tie breaking vote and took that to mean that we had an opportunity to revolutionize our country towards progressive ideas. 26 of her 33 tie breaking votes were just to build their cabinet through nomination votes.  Moreover, two of those 50 Democrats aren't even Democrats anymore. People look at the Democratic party as a monolith as if they're like the Republican party, but the Democratic party is very much a big tent party covering a wide range of ideologies.  When you have Senators in your 50/50 tie who ended up leaving the Democratic party you can't claim that as a win much less a missed opportunity! The opportunity was never there and it was just wishful thinking to think it was going to provide anything meaningful. Then the voters turned the knife by giving the Republicans the House to years later.  In order to get enough Democrats who do support progressive policies, they need much larger numbers in elected office to account for the blue dogs and moderates. You don't get that when people are ""punishing"" the Democratic party for the Republicans' actions and obstruction.  And I say this all as someone who doesn't even identify as a Democrat.

">Those golden years mostly benefitted white families with married parents.  I mean...I'm mixed race. My very nonwhite family members who came of age in those times could all step out of a Horatio Alger American Dream story. Now, only *one* person in my generation (we're a big family and my crop is mostly in the 30s) even has kids because housing prices and CoL are so out of control. Our parents didn't have to deal with insane rent prices, insane school prices, insane childcare prices, hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills, and a legion of other CoL problems.  I grew up in a heavily nonwhite, older union neighborhood in the rustbelt--heavily dependent on the auto industry. It used to be relatively prosperous. It definitely isn't anymore--the auto crash screwed half the neighborhood over and the 2000s crash re-opened wounds that never healed.  I get where you're coming from, but there's absolutely been an economic landscape shift. Our country is richer than ever and everyone knows it--this shift didn't have to happen like it did. Imo politics for the last \~40+ years has been defined by the public's hatred for the new economic status quo Nixon & Reagan ushered in. And in response to this mass popular discontent, our party decided to pretend there isn't a problem at all (Biden's approach here was downright offensive) while excising any economic populism or labor-oriented thinking.  The reason Trump and MAGA are dangerous is that they have a very legitimate core economic grievance that no mainstream political entity even acknowledges, forget attempting to fix. This has made it very easy for any bad-faith conman (Trump but also the whole Republican party for decades) to tap into this unacknowledged anger. That's why much of his base glorifies him--they think he's the only one who actually gets it, the only one who hears their screams.

">The data shows that Black women didn't vote for Trump. And many Hispanics are white. Your perspective just doesn't match the data.  Uh, opposite actually. Your economic & political perspectives are diametrically opposed to all the data trends we've been seeing. You're also conflating a lot of very different points and just taking all kinds of casual assumptions as fact. Like this bit right here--perfect example. Your assumption was that anger = white (male implied) racism. My response is that many nonwhite people (including many women) are *furious* about the exact same root causes, but that anger is very easy to manipulate using racism with economically dissatisfied white people. And your rebuttal was...that can't be true because non-white women didn't vote for Trump and Hispanics are white?  Do you see the problems with that back and forth? Because that's a deeply dysfunctional logic chain that you're presenting as gospel without doing any of the work to establish it as true or relevant. And I'm going to be honest, that logic tangle feels a bit representative of our communications.  I strongly believe that Reagan triggered an eventual economic collapse where people who got sufficiently ahead during the better times have been able to stay ahead. This problem was exacerbated with each modern economic crisis--each time, the wealthy took the opportunity to further restructure America into a plutocracy treadmill.  Those of us who didn't build up speed in time have to work several times as hard to keep up. So basically young people (not from extraordinarily wealthy households) and people who weren't well off before each crash are extremely disadvantaged. While people who got cozy *before* the financial earthquakes separated the classes are essentially living in a parallel dimension.  So many of your comments seem to completely misunderstand what my complaints even are. In my experience, this is very typical of older people who got theirs in time and are now completely incapable of understanding why people hate the 21st century economy--thus the incomprehension why people are angry and the ""I don't know, must be racism"" response. Unfortunately, our party leadership & strategists are overwhelmingly older generations who outraced this economic collapse and are sitting pretty with absolutely no idea that people are mad. The result is that our party has been completely unable to compete in the 21st century--our only real success was Obama, who acknowledged that dissatisfaction and ran a change platform *against* the party.",Sminahin,2025-04-24T11:35:42,6
