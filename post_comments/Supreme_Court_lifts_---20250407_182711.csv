"From the article:  The Supreme Court vacated a judge’s order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport Venezuelans, enabling the ability to resume removals under the wartime powers.  The matter before the Supreme Court was not whether the Trump administration properly used its wartime power to expel those it accused of being gang members but from where those challenging their removal must launch their suits.  While the order requires those challenging Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to do so in Texas, where they are being detained, the court dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s swift removal of the mean without hearings.  The court said Venezuelans they seek to deport must have adequate notice in order to be able to challenge their removal – confronting the administration’s removal of men without giving them the ability to contest their alleged gang ties.",kootles10,2025-04-07T18:27:32,1
"[Here’s a link to the order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf)  Edit:  >For all the rhetoric of the dissents, today’s order and *per curiam* confirm that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement.  We’re going to see a fuckton more people arrested and *quickly* moved to venues favorable to the administration.   This is fucking terrifying.",SchoolIguana,2025-04-07T18:41:45,1

"So this just means that now they will have an easier time deporting them. Either they go to court for relief, or if they don't then they had the time to do so. There will not be a middle ground, even with prior legal proceedings and future court dates set, they notice they could get deported under the AEA will suffice for just cause for deportation, and once deported it will no longer be ""our"" problem. Sigh. If you don't see the win for the Trump administration in this I don't think you are thinking evil enough.",Ankaa13,2025-04-07T18:32:25,1

"Cannot get your link to work but here is a similar article. https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5237011-supreme-court-trump-venezuelans-alien-enemies-act/amp/  From the article;  “AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the court wrote in a per curium order, adding that the decision “confirm[s] that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”",animalslover4569,2025-04-07T18:57:48,1
"That wasn't the challenge here. SCOTUS ruled the folks being subject to deportation via the AEA are entitled to due process, albeit in a different venue. They did not rule that removal via the AEA was lawful.    It's...not great, but it should be made clear that SCOTUS didn't rule AEA was lawful.",jetmech09,2025-04-07T18:53:21,1

He's still right so repeating the same line doesn't serve the conversion at all.      Edit: SOCTUS has proved to me it's corrupt by ruling against Chevron and giving the president more presidential immunities than the office should ever have.,Cultural_Match8786,2025-04-07T19:45:06,1
