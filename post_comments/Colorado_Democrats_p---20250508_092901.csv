"It only applies to people making over $300k a year and would be about 0.1% of their income.

> increase tax obligations  weasel words for increasing taxes on the middle class with regressive taxes,box-cable,2025-05-08T09:39:35,-17
> only applies to people making over $300k a year   which is many dual income middle class people.   This is a regressive tax.  if your family makes 300k it hits you harder than if your family makes 600k,box-cable,2025-05-08T09:40:45,-18
Stealing money to give to people who cannot afford to have kids.  Maybe these people should not have had kids in the first place.,box-cable,2025-05-08T09:42:32,-21
I’m pretty sure weasel words aren’t in English. Weasel words are more likely some high-pitched squeaks.,SecretGayFacebook,2025-05-08T10:27:31,6
"This is an increase in marginal tax brackets above $300k, not the middle class by any definition.",R-Dragon_Thunderzord,2025-05-08T11:37:38,4
"No, regressive would be a 0.1% tax on everyone. $300k is upper middle class. They have $300 extra dollars a year and will not feel it. If you’re making $300k and you struggle to pay an extra $300, you are absolutely terrible at managing your money.",meTspysball,2025-05-08T09:48:33,21
$300K per year is top 5% in the country…  Under what definition of “middle” are you using to claim that top 5% is middle?,aztecthrowaway1,2025-05-08T10:48:29,11

So those kids should starve to death to teach the parents a lesson? How on earth is feeding children a controversial issue?,pilgrim216,2025-05-08T09:50:21,21
"Cool. Ensure access to abortion and comprehensive sex education. Because there aren’t any parents going, “You know, I wasn’t going to have this kid, but if school will give them a free lunch 180 days a year once they’re 5, that clinches it. I’m having a kid.”",UnionizedTrouble,2025-05-08T09:57:48,12
"What’s your solution? And don’t say “these kids shouldn’t exist in the first place” because 1. They do, 2. It doesn’t lend credit to the idea that the GOP cares about kids ",Elegant_Plate6640,2025-05-08T09:58:44,9
I'm not sure you understand the purpose of social programs if you're publicly stating that poor people should not have children.  >Stealing money to give to people who cannot afford to have kids. Maybe these people should not have had kids in the first place.  I was disgusted enough that I thought better and had to edit the comment to quote you,mlc885,2025-05-08T09:58:18,7
"""Feeding kids is stealing."" That's certainly a take one can have.",Wings81,2025-05-08T11:36:06,7
"How do you know that at the time the people had children they couldn't afford them? Do you think people's circumstances and lives just never change for 60 years? Do you think two people in their 20s or 30s that had good paying jobs and started having children may possibly have lost those jobs say because of the current administration? Your statement is so simple and so incredibly stupid I'm surprised you would even post that here and know people are going to ridicule you. My husband and I are much better off financially than we were when we had our children but we could afford them when we had them. We're watching all around us as our children's friends, who started having children because they had good jobs, have been horribly impacted by so many circumstances in life and now are struggling. God damn it man, have some empathy for other human beings for once in your freaking life. I am so sick of answers like this. No thought to it, just propaganda.",Ande64,2025-05-08T10:41:38,5
If the wealthy didn’t steal money from people to hoard it just to live off the dividends everyone could “afford kids” did you even pay back your parents in full for raising you?,R-Dragon_Thunderzord,2025-05-08T11:36:57,2

"It is the responsibility of the parents, not the taxpayers, to feed their children. If they are unable to do so, their children should be taken away by Child Services and placed in a suitable home.

">If they are unable to do so, their children should be taken away by Child Services and placed in a suitable home.   Do you think this would be more or less expensive than subsidizing school meal programs? Keep in mind you're asking to give more power to a system to take people's children away, house them, provide food and health care for them in said housing, schedule court days and government check-ups versus giving them an apple and some knock-off Cheerios.",Elegant_Plate6640,2025-05-08T12:02:43,4
Small bills stack up. Though I get it 300k should be good enough. That’s just not the case for everyone ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-08T10:34:37,-6
"If the taxpayers must pay either way, there should be consequences such as those that I described. Perhaps this will disincentivize the parents (and deter others) from pumping out more children they can't afford.",deeceever,2025-05-08T12:23:37,-4
"Come on dude, you don’t have to double-down on this. If $300k isn’t enough, the 0.1% tax to feed children isn’t the problem.",meTspysball,2025-05-08T10:43:20,10
"So your solution is a more expensive, trauma-inducing plan that would at best lead to lower birth rates, which the American taxpayer will surely support over just subsidizing school meals.  I guess it's not ""those kids shouldn't exist in the first place!"" so... Good job with that thought exercise.  Jonathan Swift would be proud.",Elegant_Plate6640,2025-05-08T12:28:09,6
"There’s a considerable, dangerous, and evil cadre of folks in government and civil service who a) see poverty as a moral failing, and b) see their role as building a punitive society based on that assumption. These are not even greedy, rent-seeking capitalists— they’re their vile enablers.   I worked for a stint in child welfare in rural WV. A common reason for removal was what showed up in paperwork as “deplorable conditions” i.e. a dirty house. (Obviously, another euphemism for poverty) There were clear instances where the state (really the courts) would rather pay >$2,000 a day to uproot a child from their family, friends, and community than pay a $200 house cleaner or exterminator to solve the problem.",bloodoftyrant,2025-05-08T14:00:54,2
Poverty is not the moral failing. It is a poor couple having children they cannot afford and assigning the taxpayers the responsibility to pay for their children. Policy that disfavors punitive solutions only encourages failing behavior.,deeceever,2025-05-08T18:07:59,-4
"This is just so wrong headed and doesn't contemplate reality at all.  AI and modernization is decimating jobs left and right, people can BECOME poor.  Through medical debt (because our country is fucked), accident, job displacement.  And even if that wasn't true.  You just boringly continue to argue a pointless premise.  You want to punish poor people for 'having kids' WHILE taking on a MUCH more massive tax burden.  It's just straight up a dumb idea.  You make the situation worse, while also being cruel.",7-11Armageddon,2025-05-08T21:42:07,1
