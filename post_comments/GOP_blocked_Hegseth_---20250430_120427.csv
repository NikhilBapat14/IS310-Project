"I agree that Pete Hegseth's actions here are indefensible but many in this thread seem to misunderstand what is happening here.  Adam Smith is a Democrat who tried to open the inquiry, and it is Adam Smith who is arguing that the GOP won't allow the inquiry because they know Hegseth's actions cannot be defended.  This is NOT a Republican who said we won't open an inquiry because we expect the results to be impossible to defend.",Politicallyrational,2025-04-30T15:29:37,39

To me if both sides are arguably the same on Gaza, it seems crazy to refuse to make a choice and let republicans make everything so much worse on thousands of other issues, just for no difference on Gaza.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T14:46:07,8

">Politicians have to earn your vote. This whole accepting dog shit because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù evil is why we‚Äôre in this mess in the first place.  I hate this argument. No matter what, someone WILL win the election and will go into office. Should we have had a primary? Yes, but Biden said he was running again, so what we had was more a formality. And as we've seen, even after conitting treason, you can't stop someone from running even if they want to.      But you know what makes me the angriest about this argument...

Yeah the type of attitude of who you responded to is why we keep moving so far to the right as a country. People who want fascism are voting 100 percent of the time even if they don't like the Republican candidate and Republicans spend so much money trying to make people on the left not vote. So many people think they are standing up for progressive values but in reality are repeating republican talking points and unintentionally pushing the country further right.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T19:44:52,8
"You brought up a random area in Ohio with no context. The GOP person won't even show up. A Democrat who is theoretically running in November 2027 should be showing up instead, and if not both parties are the same.  You should vote if you don't want fascism in the future.   The Supreme Court is being ignored despite a unanimous ruling, the constitution is being shredded.  Nothing has gotten any better for Gaza. Everything is worse for Americans. We are threatening to invade Canada and again threatening our NATO allies with Greenland.  If you think not voting against that is wasting your vote that's on you.    Your position is what the Soviet Union spent decades trying to forment in the US. You are complaining about showing up one day a year and making a choice so things don't get worse. I can't believe you feel like not making a choice isn't a choice. People died for your right to vote.  I have sympathy for people who simply couldn't vote for Democrats because of genocide in Palestine. You are not that.  This is the kind of attitude that never existed in the 80s and 90s when things already started to go downhill. Your comment let's me know, we are in fact doomed.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T01:35:45,1
