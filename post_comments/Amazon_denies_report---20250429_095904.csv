It would be so Trumpian for this administration to have bought into misinformation from the internet lmao.,alien88,2025-04-29T10:02:29,20
"Oh, it'll definitely show in the prices. The only real question is whether it'll be itemized.   Does Trump think he can tax people in *secret*? Like if you don't tell them they won't notice the money missing? I guess if you've never once in your life had to worry about groceries, that makes perfect sense.",pervocracy,2025-04-29T10:09:33,17

It really says a lot when Trump is getting rage baited off of misinformation.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-29T10:12:53,5
Every retailer should show it the same way they all show sales tax.,mkt853,2025-04-29T10:30:35,5

This is election interference by Amazon to hide the effect of Trump's dangerous and stupid policies.,insuproble,2025-04-29T10:15:09,2
Temu is doing it.  Amazon should too.  Don’t know if they are caving in to Trump or not.  Not sure where Trump heard they were going to do this if they deny having planned it.   I say we boycott Amazon until tariffs are listed.  This seems like essential information these days.   It would also help keep domestic prices and inflation down as we would know what we could have had at a fair price.,KidKilobyte,2025-04-29T10:37:24,2
They should list it,jimibimi,2025-04-29T10:15:33,1
Shouldn’t they want it listed to show how much the “other countries are paying the tariffs”?,AngryPlaqueMan,2025-04-29T10:23:13,1
Amazon should show it if the tariffs are going to be charged when checking out.   There should be no surprises for the buyer.,confused_ma,2025-04-29T10:24:51,1

"If my package don' show  tariff charge I don't  want it.   Based on a story my dad  told me about an old German who when Potsdam Missouri was changed to Pershing, Mo.  said ""If my mail don't say Potsdam I don't want  it.""",DistrictDue1913,2025-05-01T15:50:33,1

"No, he wants to blame any seller that raises prices as a result of tariffs.",Kincherk,2025-04-29T10:44:07,2
"I don’t think it will be, Amazon won’t have that information from the third party sellers, who are the ones setting the price. They can estimate the cost of tariffs on an individual product or have a little blurb like explaining why this product is more expensive than it was a month ago, but the exact cost would only be known to the sellers.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-29T12:18:42,1
