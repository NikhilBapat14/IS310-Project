**A lack of accountability breeds future atrocities.**  One of the five lessons learned from WW II. Share that one with Israel and the US.,Fritja,2025-05-09T07:47:41,8

It would be a nice start if Putin would just you know fuck off from Ukraine. There’s a legitimate reason that the eastern block countries wanted to be in NATO as Ukraine wants as well.,Benedictus_The_II,2025-05-09T08:38:23,6
It’s your Russian accent that’s giving it away,Be-skeptical,2025-05-09T08:48:29,3
"Lol “legitimate reason”, as in decades of Western backed coups, color revolutions and NATO’s aggressive expansion up to Russia’s doorstep after explicitly promising otherwise in the 90s. Ukraine is being used as a proxy pawn in a geopolitical chessboard drawn by imperialists, and it’s the people who suffer, just like in Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia and countless other nations “liberated” by NATO bombs.",Next_Ant_4353,2025-05-09T08:45:19,-1
NATO also existed in the 1850s during the Crimean War - without the participation of USA.   It was still atlanticist North Atlantic Alliance against Moscow's Empire.,mediandude,2025-05-09T12:00:58,1
Dude. Seriously stop… My grandad was beaten up by the “communists gendarme” because he dared to sing the Szekler hymn in Hungary in the 60s and the Russians beaten down two of our rebellion. One in 1848 and one in 1956. We don’t want or need Russian authority nowhere near us.  And yeah… I can understand the Ukranians not wanting Russian control over their head either. Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum as well not just the U.S.,Benedictus_The_II,2025-05-09T08:56:34,1
