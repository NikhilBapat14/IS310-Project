"It actually really has nothing to do with religion, it's that the government has no ability to compel speech from people against their beliefs.  A French immigrant graphic designer cannot be forced to design a poster glorifying England, a Jewish interior designer can't be forced to make a nazi-themed house, and an atheist pro-life printshop owner can't be forced to make pro-abortion pamphlets.

"> The mass media has gone out of their way to completely misrepresent the facts of the case and the outcome.  The issue is that there is a narrow interpretation of this ruling and a broad interpretation of this ruling, and it's absolutely not clear which is going to be implemented. The media is reporting on the broad interpretation because they think, and I agree, that it is the most likely interpretation that will be implemented.  The court could have provided a clear and narrow test for what ""pure speech"" is, but it decided not to. Without that test, it is one hundred percent possible for a white restaurant owner to find a way that refusing a black patron is a form of speech. Perhaps this person has a moral objection to miscegenation and thus feels that allowing a black person to sit with a white person in a public place means that anyone who sees them in the restaurant will interpret that as an endorsement of interracial relations.   That may sound like an insane argument, but the court declined to create a standard to rule it out, which it means it will have to be litigated, and will likely return to the Supreme Court.   That particular case is probably too odious for the court to allow, but what if the case is two gay people going on a date together, I could easily see the court viewing that as a form of speech.",loselyconscious,2023-07-06T17:06:51,1

"The entire premise of this decision is that they are not dealing with discrimination on the basis of identity but rather with speech endorsing a political or religious opinion. The court did not rule that 303 Creative can refuse service to gay people; it did rule that it can refuse service for gay weddings.  That means a business could refuse service on the basis of a religious objection (they don't believe Jewish weddings or Catholic weddings etc., are real weddings) but not of a wedding between two Catholics or two Jews, etc. That's where the court will have to intervene to decide the line between identity discrimination and ""pure speech."" How much of the wedding needs to have Jewish or Catholic rituals to count as a religious objection?  And what if they don't believe in interreligious weddings, the line between identity-based discrimination and pure speech is really fuzzy.  This court could have created a narrow test for what counts as ""pure speech.""

He would do that if he could but that would be challenged in court even if Florida is conservative he would not get reelected. (he can't serve two terms in Florida anyway but that's besides the point.) There are states with much more conservative administrations. They can't do stuff like that because... you know... elections. I'm arguing for what we have now. (before the latest Supreme Court case)  The system as it is now, with all its flaws, works for the most part now, and limited restrictions to free speech exist now. You can't harass an old Jewish lady by waving a nazi flag in her face while she walks down the street. You can't burn a cross in your yard if your neighbor is African American. Teens can't wear a shirt with a curse word on it to school. You can't incite riots.  All of that is fine with me but with your absolutism, all of those limitations would vanish.

There would be no bill of rights if popularity mattered more than liberty.  > with your absolutism, all those restrictions would vanish  It isn’t my absolutism. The constitution is not vague about this. “No law” means “no law.” It doesn’t mean “some laws”, or “reasonable laws”, or “laws specifically to prevent hateful acts.” It means “no law.”  > does this ruling allow a white owner to decide not to serve a black patron  I don’t think the freedom of association is necessarily the same as free speech - ie creative expression. It’s definitely vague, but if a freedom is vague we ought to err on the side of too much freedom as opposed to too little.  I think the parts of the CRA that apply to private establishments ought to have been struck down the moment they were signed by LBJ because the government has no authority to do anything remotely like that, but I think free speech is a separate issue.",PoliticsDunnRight,2023-07-06T07:38:41,2

As to you advocating FOR segregation well, i don't know man... I'll take it at its most innocent. The goverment DOES have the power to change public opinion and when that power is used on a limited bases (stressing limited. Repeat stressing limited) it can have beneficial effects.
