Horrifically disappointing. I was looking forward to seeing her in the primaries.,Taint_Liquor,2025-04-30T09:12:41,14

Her political career is over. Just ask Chris Christie about hugging the opposition.,mkt853,2025-04-30T09:30:56,5

I’m want to apologize to AP for commenting that the first thing they did after getting their press credentials back was to run a hit piece on Whitmer becoming Trumpy. They were right.,2a_lib,2025-04-30T09:24:55,4

"  ""Asked about her hug with Trump, Whitmer chose to describe the encounter differently.  She said Trump greeted her first when he stepped off the plane, and he “shook hands and he leaned in to tell me, you know, congratulations and that I was a big reason that we were making an announcement today, and I was grateful for that.”  She said working with him on some issues doesn’t preclude her from criticizing him on others, adding that she’s been clear with Trump that his tariffs have been damaging her state.  “I had to be there because this was a big, important thing for the state of Michigan,” she said. ”Now, he is going to go off to the rally and say a lot of things I disagree with, that I’ll fight against, and that’s fine, but, you know, my job is to do everything I can for the people of Michigan.”  Earlier this month, Whitmer stood by in the Oval Office as Trump signed executive orders and assailed his political opponents, not long after she had delivered a speech nearby that offered soft criticism of him but emphasized shared priorities. Later, The New York Times published a photo showing her using folders to shield her face from cameras while in the Oval Office.  Whitmer’s office later said in a statement that she was “surprised” that she was brought into the room and that “her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”  The Trump-Whitmer embrace evoked an infamous greeting more than a decade ago between Chris Christie, then the Republican governor of New Jersey, and Barack Obama, the Democratic president. Weeks before the 2012 election, with Christie and Obama both seeking reelection, the president arrived in New Jersey in the aftermath of the devastating Superstorm Sandy. Obama placed his hand on Christie’s shoulder, but angry Republicans labeled it a “hug,” and suggested it contributed to Republican Mitt Romney’s loss to Obama.  It also reflects the challenge for Democratic governors looking to register their disapproval of Trump and his policies without angering a president bent on retribution against his critics or turning off soft Trump voters whose support they might need in future elections.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has also taken heat from some on the left who see him as excessively accommodating of Trump and his policies, showered the president with praise when he landed in Los Angeles to tour wildfire damage during his first week in office. At the time, Newsom was urgently seeking federal disaster funding and looking to dissuade Trump from following through on his threats to extract concessions from California in exchange for financial assistance""",TIMELESS_COLD,2025-04-30T09:17:22,1
"She’s the governor of over ten million people and this was huge for Michigan.  I’m sure she’d prefer not to have to grease the wheel, but that’s not really an option. She has to be pragmatic and pick smart battles.      I wouldn’t remotely equate this with what Bill Maher did.",DaySoc98jr,2025-04-30T11:44:25,1
"He is the president. She is a governor. It’s her job to advocate for her state. I admire the governors of Maine and Massachusetts very much but they are very different states and she’s got the auto industry to consider.  I loathe him but unilaterally cutting him off isn’t sustainable for four years.  And if you put in your thinking cap, you can tell he’s targeting her because she’s a threat. Don’t buy into it.",ToneSenior7156,2025-04-30T09:31:28,-2
Backlash?  I feel sorry for her.  She's just trying to get shit done for our state... has to deal with this POS.,Brokkyn2024,2025-04-30T09:14:33,-3
She will be the 2028 Democratic nominee.    And tons of democrats will stay home on election day because they're still mad she hugged Trump.  And Trump will win a 3rd term.,box-cable,2025-05-01T02:00:55,1
Hope it was worth ending her political career over,Angedelanuit97,2025-05-01T05:33:30,1
She ended her political career to suck up to trump. It's not any more complicated than that.,Angedelanuit97,2025-05-01T05:34:17,2
"She is in a difficult position and I agree that she got targeted. She got in front of the troops which may prove important. But she did look like she got manipulated, which hurts on a national scale.  It's the same game plan that Hitler had success with, when he outlawed opposition political parties within 2 months of taking office. Here we have attacks on Dem's ActBlue and ""investigations"" into Trump's low ratings. Point is that there is no real safety in midterms or 4-year thinking.",kleenkong,2025-04-30T13:04:55,1
"Appeasement and groveling to a fascist dictator is never the right move. Of course there's nuance to the circumstances here, but regardless, you never, ever show public admiration for a fucking authoritarian.",dietTAB,2025-04-30T09:25:26,11
I mean… the dude’s wife doesn’t hug him.,ontopic,2025-04-30T09:20:57,5
Why? she could have just shook his fucking hand. What a joke.    Do people really think if this economy really tanks that voters are going to be looking for people that were kissing his ass? They are going to be saying what the fuck were you doing.    She will never be the nominee. She is done. ,Express_Resource_415,2025-04-30T09:18:57,9
"The nuance is the dude moved in for a hug when there was a handshake.  She did not ""show public admiration"" for him.",Brokkyn2024,2025-04-30T09:40:50,-1

Did you even read the f'ing article?  Don't answer that... you didn't.,Brokkyn2024,2025-04-30T09:41:53,1
"OK, fair enough I guess -- but let's be honest, that's not how the public will see this. They'll see a warm hug from a supposedly staunch adversary, thereby lending an air of legitimacy to the fascist. The optics are fucked. This is Dump flexing because he knows Whitmer needs something from him. The onus is now on her to clarify her stance, and she's in a weakened position.  Again: do not appease or accommodate fascists.",dietTAB,2025-04-30T09:50:19,2
Any nuance will be completely lost if she tries to run for President.  Maaaaybe they’ll give her a pass in Michigan. But her wider political aspirations as a Democrat are done.    ,Snoo_17338,2025-04-30T20:46:41,1
Why would give a shit what the article said. It is irrelevant. I do not care what she is trying to get from him. That woman is done politically now. Done. ,Express_Resource_415,2025-04-30T10:45:53,1
"""The optics are fucked.""  Unfortunately, you are 100% correct.",Brokkyn2024,2025-04-30T10:14:02,1
"""I do not care what she is trying to get from him.""  Of course you don't... because you are likely in a position to not care.  But the people of Michigan, specifically the ones that need this, do.  Also... ""Why would give a shit what the article said.""... Thank's for letting me know that you are not a person worth having a conversation with.",Brokkyn2024,2025-04-30T12:01:42,2
"Yeah, and we live in a very surface-level, ""vibe"" driven culture. Whitmer has done incalculable damage to her image and public perception.",dietTAB,2025-04-30T10:24:14,2
