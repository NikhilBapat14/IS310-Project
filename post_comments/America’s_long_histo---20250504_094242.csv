Rarely? That implies anyone ever got this far and accumulated this level of power with the intention of destroying our country.      The equivalent would be if Jefferson Davis was the president during the Civil War instead of Lincoln.,vucubcame,2025-05-04T09:48:53,10
"It’s being shown to be paper thin. The strength is supposed to come from the people who exercise it, and they are far too willing to let him shit all over the constitution…that is, until he runs out of Browns and Gays and starts coming for the Whites.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T10:06:45,8
"Many of the checks and balances were predicated on the assumption that the US would be a no-party system.  There was no Plan B if that didn't turn out to be true.  And of course, it wasn't true.  The founders inadvertently laid the groundwork for a two-party system.  That erodes the checks and balances provided by Congress as the representatives will usually back a president of their party.  Instead of jealously guarding their roles as legislators, they fall into line in their roles as party members.    With only two parties, there will be almost always be enough representatives in the president's party that they can impact the result.  This of course is worse when there is a trifecta, as we have right now.",I405CA,2025-05-04T10:29:34,5
Our only hope is the judicial branch.  And that branch has already shown signs of rot.,nwgdad,2025-05-04T10:01:18,3
"The problem is that we rely on ""norms"" or ""customs"" instead of laws to uphold these checks and balances. Take something like Presidential candidates releasing their tax returns, or White House releasing details about the President's health checkup. Why rely on norms or customs? Just pass a law that makes it mandatory.",xibeno9261,2025-05-04T11:28:54,2

“…being tested”? Are you kidding me the test is over they failed. American Democracy is dead,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T18:48:38,1
"Checks and balances were based on norms and conventions. When Congress and the Supreme Court are captured by the President like we’re seeing now, there are no checks and balances.",HardeeHamlin,2025-05-04T19:11:25,1
There are no checks and balances - Congress votes their Party and kisses the ring of the President. What do you mean “tested”?,paolilon,2025-05-04T22:14:03,1

"Any system of checks and balances that is dependent on nine robed fella, appointed at full discretion of the President and Senate majority (which is a fundamentally undemocratic institution), who then decide what is legal or not based on their own interpretation of a 300-year old piece of paper, isn't exactly a well-designed system of checks and balances.  Especially when the president who disobeyed those nine dudes, and faced no repercussions for ot, is on your $20.",lil_chiakow,2025-05-05T06:24:42,1
"How smart they were doesn’t matter, they are dead. What matters now is how stupid the average current living American is.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T10:07:42,8
The correct answer. Millions carry a device capable of informing them about the history of fascism and tyranny. Yet choose to use it for the express purposes of visual stimulation and self promotion.,williamgman,2025-05-04T10:38:09,7
