"Bill Gates isn't accusing Musk, he's accurately pointing out that USAID cuts will lead to dead children.   >If this foreign aid is not restored before the end of 2025, more than 176,000 additional adults and children around the world could die from HIV, according to excess death estimates from a new digital tracking initiative by Brooke Nichols, associate professor of global health. Her tracker also indicates that at least 62,000 additional people could die from tuberculosis (TB)—roughly one death every 7.7 minutes—if foreign aid does not resume by the end of the year, and these figures are steadily increasing.  [Source.](https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/tracking-anticipated-deaths-from-usaid-funding-cuts/) By providing aid, the US helps to stabilize the world so our troops don't get put in harms way. An example of instability putting our troops at risk is Yemen. Houthis are launching missiles at commercial traffic and as a result, the US Navy was sent out to protect shipping lanes. One incident almost resulted in one of US Navy's ships almost getting blown up and it had to activate its last line of defense.   With so many kids dying, not to mention all the food we used to give out, instability will follow. Where there's instability there is violence and US troops tend to follow to stabilize regions. The impacts of these cuts will be felt for years if not restored.",TranquilSeaOtter,2025-05-08T07:55:46,878

"I feel like ""accuse"" isn't a definite enough of a term of what Bill has done. He has identified excess deaths that will occur directly due to DOGE cuts at Musk's direction with his full knowledge of what would happen.  What's even worse is the ripple effect that goes with this. The higher mortality means stability in these regions is decreased, it's more prone to unrest. Unrest that disrupts the global economy and puts the remaining aid workers at greater risk. The money that was cut was among the best value in the budget. Like IRS funding, the EnergyStar program, EPA, FDA, DOE, and healthcare. All of these programs and agencies have provided a value to the people that far exceeds their costs despite being frequently underfunded. It's ironic that the Department Of Government Efficiency seems to be cutting some of the most efficient programs in government, and seems to ignore the most wasteful, such as a nearly $100 million military parade or wasteful spending at Trump hotels by Secret Service stuck tagging along for the President's constant golf trips.",CaliforniaNavyDude,2025-05-08T14:39:27,1

That warchest earns interest, often in excess of the expenditures, but the expenditures themselves often return no financial reward.

"Broadly and briefly: Because the US's position as a global superpower requires being and having influence everywhere. The optimistic angle on this is that all of the sick and impoverished you help in a country are far more likely to ally with you against opposing states, form more positive trade relations with you, and generally share the best of their people/society with yours, all while generally being a good thing to do things that combat human suffering.   The less optimistic angle is countries who are only staving off abject starvation or the ravages of disease because of support from your country are a lot less likely to say no to companies from your county taking their resources for pennies on the dollar or hosting your military bases.  There's a reason why China's ascendance to superpower status also includes increases in foreign aid and development.

On that note, the most effective solution UNICEF ever came up with to fight hunger was a peanut butter solution they would give to children and The US just ended that by removing our countries financial support for a tax break (for Bill Gates and all his buddies) and despite his spoken disapproval, he loves the tax breaks. The “80 million lives” (sources please) you claim he’s saving are a consolation prize. In exchange for this amount, which is negligible to him, he gets the undying loyalty of people like you, for steering global efforts to less effective causes. We could do more with his money in the form of tax dollars and save more lives if he would just get the hell out of the way and stop trying to put his name on everything.",Melodic_Reveal_2979,2025-05-08T13:21:26,0

"The Bill Gates Foundation is a collaborate partner of the International Monetary Fund, which as an institution inflicts austerity on third world countries and has cost many thousands of lives.  The general process is   - Third world dictator takes out loan to 'develop' nation - Third world dictator promptly stashes the money in an overseas account - Third world dictator runs away - The IMF forces the country to repay the loans, either with exorbitant interest or by ceding control of some nationalized industry to private financiers.    I was listening to a talk by David Graeber (RIP to a real one).  He did anthropology work in Madagascar, and his direct run in with the IMF was that they forced the government there to end mosquito net programs for children in the Madagascar highlands.  It took years for the program to recover, and the result was that thousands of people unnecessarily died from Malaria for no other reason than to save a few pennies.",SantorumsGayMasseuse,2025-05-08T08:57:55,2

It's actually terrible for the world for business conglomerates to be gobbling up formerly independent businesses under single ownership; no one benefits from that except the ultra-wealthy, and it continues to funnel that money to the ultra-wealthy instead of of letting it disperse amongst the wider community. Berkshire Hathaway doesn't innovate or invest in new business, they just buy existing strong businesses so that *they* can eat up the continued profits.

Errol Musk (now 76) and Jana Bezuidenhout (now 35) met when he married her mother, Heidi when Jana was 8 and they remained married for 18 years, divorcing in the 90’s. So Musk was in her life, as a father, for the duration.    After the marriage they didn’t see each other for 10 years until Jana called musk asking for help. She had an 8 year old child and described herself as “battling”.   He took her in, and as one does, he developed a relationship with the little girl he raised and had two more kids together.   Errol Musk has repeatedly said it’s his job to procreate as much as possible and finds nothing wrong with his relationship with his stepdaughter and now, former wife and mother of two of his kids.

"There's not a single \*known act\* by Allen that brands him as a 'perv'.  There are many well-established facts and testimonies that indicate he is not a 'perv'.  For instance: \*all his exes\* still love him: Harlene Rosen and Louise Lasser, his first two wives. Diane Keaton and Stacey Nelkin, his two girlfriends. The \*only\* exception being Mia Farrow, a known deceiver.  His wife of 30+ years (Soon-Yi Previn) and their two grown daughters (Bechet and Manzie) adore him.  Throughout his 70 yearrs' career, Allen has worked with literally hundreds of actors, actresses, and co-workers. \*Not a single one\* has complained about any misbehavior. Many said to have enjoyed working with him.  \*Now read the custody trial reports.\* They inform us that Allen had, and wanted no business whatsoever with Mia Farrow's ""Previn children"" whom she raised along with her ex-husband André Previn. Allen did not live with Mia, and had no part whatsoever in raising these children. He shunned their company, as he did not want to be some 'surrogate' father to children who already \*had\* a father in their lives.  From 1985, he acted as a co-father to two children Mia had adopted, and who did not have a father: Moses and Dylan. Two years later, Mia got a biological child (Ronan) whom she claimed was 'Woody's', but later said Ronan is 'possibly Sinatra's child'. That is the kind of woman we're dealing with here.  \*Now read the witnesses' testimony.\* Mia nannies \*praised\* Woody's fathering, and called him 'the better parent' in comparison to Mia. Her housekeeper found him to be a 'good father'. Mia's hired child therapists stated that Woody was enormously committed to being a good father, and commended him on it.   In 1990, Mia asked Woody to start spending time with her 20 yo daughter Soon-Yi - something Woody had never done or wanted before. \*Not\* his initiative, \*not\* his wish. He simply gave in to Mia's request, with her full knowledge and consent.   It took these two people more than a year to develop a friendship and, finally, fall in love. This happened \*four years\* after Mia had already abandoned Woody as her lover. Mia was by no means entitled to Woody's love. She had 'possibly' cheated on Woody with Ronan/Sinatra. Woody in no way 'cheated' on a lover by getting invested with Soon-Yi.  Their relationship has proven to be serious, durable, harmonious, faithful, and productive. It led to marriage, and happy parenthood.",Ill_Letterhead4170,2025-05-09T08:42:11,1

"Mia discovered the relationship in January 1992. Up until then, Mia had been nothing but complimentary about Woody's fathering. She very much wanted him to co-adopt Moses and Dylan. For that purpose, Mia had written a recommendation in December 1991, saying Woody was 'a loving, caring, attentive and nurturing father'; 'far more of a father than most natural fathers are or choose to be’; 'Dylan can only benefit from having him as an adoptive father'; 'he has acted as Dylan's father almost since her birth and adoption by me'; 'he is present with us during nearly all of Dylan's waking hours'.  From that moment on, Mia excluded Woody from Dylan's life. There has not been any stretch of time during which Woody fathered over Dylan and Mia \*not liking it, and not supporting it\*.  So what do we have? Woody is still loved by the many women in his life, a highly dubious Mia being the only exception. Woody was being praised for his fathering over Moses, Dylan and Satchel/Ronan, and is adored by the two children he actually got to raise, Bechet and Manzie. Zero women have alleged him of misbehavior toward them. Not a single charge was ever made against him.  We have Mia Farrow, with a dubious past of lies and deceit. John Lennon did not believe her dubious allegation about the Maharishi Yogi 'coming after her'. Mia betrayed her best friend Dory Previn, by f\*cking Dory's husband of 12 years behind her back, getting pregnant, then making him divorce Dory, and marry him instead. Mia lied to Woody about 'his son' Ronan; lied to her son Ronan about his father; and lied in court (perjury!) when suing Woody for child support millions; only admitting after that money train had run out.  Mia could never maintain a serious relationship. Not with Sinatra, not with André Previn, and not with Woody Allen.  While Woody has been in a happy, loving, durable relationship for 33 years already. And his former relationships 1955-1980 were all happy. Even when they ended, they ended amicably.  Do you know what is really 'perverse'? Denying the above HARD FACTS. Baselessly calling someone a 'lifetime perv'. Smearing someone with a nonsensical 'PR disinformation' claim. Being unwilling to present any verifiable fact to support such claims.",Ill_Letterhead4170,2025-05-09T08:42:25,1
"Thank you for proving my point that Allen has richly funded false propaganda teams.    I’m not going to waste time debunking each of your lies, but I’ll just point out that dumb statements like “there are many facts that prove he’s NOT a perv” are objectively illogical and patently dishonest.  The pervert you’re being paid to defend had a habit of taking nude pictures of his child daughters.  Tell us again how that “proves” he’s not a perv.",AntoniaFauci,2025-05-09T12:53:24,1
