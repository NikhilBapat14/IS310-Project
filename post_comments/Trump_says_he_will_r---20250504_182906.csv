That rotting pile of bricks and concrete will never reopen.,KehreAzerith,2025-05-04T18:42:05,47
"Alcatraz was closed because it was too expensive to run. Every single little thing had to be ferried to the island.  It doesn't make sense for Trump to re-open a very expensive prison when he's complaining about money spent on things like health care.  Oh, who am I kidding... the words ""Trump"" and ""sense"" don't even belong in the same sentence.",Studious_Noodle,2025-05-04T18:56:28,47

He says a lot of things. This isn’t going to happen.,HaxanWriter,2025-05-04T20:05:30,6
It's a National Park. That probably means he thinks he owns it and can do with it as he likes,JVilter,2025-05-04T23:52:43,5

"It's all distraction. Something big is going to happen and he's just making headlines and chaos to divert everyone from what's really going down. Just like we are not actually trying to purchase Greenland and make Canada the 51st state, he is just putting stuff out there to get Democrats riled up so they don't pay attention to what's going on yeah yeah yeah yeah",Beautiful_Reporter50,2025-05-04T20:04:39,32

"This is exactly how I feel. If every day is the biggest headline, the real headlines will go unnoticed or fly under the radar, compared to something headline worthy but unimportant. People are starting to accept that noise is the normal. Yikes",eppingjetta,2025-05-04T20:25:53,8

I don't know if I fully believe that. I think he has no understanding of reality. He's old and demented and likely genuinely thinks this is a good idea.,Rosebunse,2025-05-05T06:24:11,5
"I actually believe this one.  Concentration camps are a necessary feature of autocracies.  Courts are stopping him from deporting these people into El Salvador's.  He needs to have these prisons domestically.  If not Alcatraz, it will be somewhere else.  Mark my words.",lsh99,2025-05-04T20:35:14,5

"He thinks all of his ideas are fabulous ideas. He has sycophants around him at all times who yes sir him no matter what crazy thing he comes up with, and deep down underneath it all is the personality that his father hired Ray Cohen, the attorney for McCarthy - if you've ever heard of the McCarthy hearings -to drill into him. Specifically never say you're wrong, never pay what you owe and sue everyone who does something against you.",Beautiful_Reporter50,2025-05-05T10:30:06,2
"He might, but it’s still a distraction. He wants us all whining about opening a prison and change the conversation to Democrats are soft on crime.   There are much more dangerous things he’s doing that we need to focus on.",pfft12,2025-05-04T21:09:00,6
"I believe the somewhere else, but Alcatraz has been a rotting mess for decades and the reason they closed it was it cost too much to ferry supplies over to the prisoners. It would be cheaper to build a whole new concentration camp in some place like Nebraska or some big wide open place where nobody notices it",Beautiful_Reporter50,2025-05-04T22:44:39,3
