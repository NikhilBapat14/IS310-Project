"Words can't begin to describe how much this pisses me off. I actually work with PBS and because of this shit, we have to hold a big meeting to address this shit. This man has done more damage to this country in 4 months than he even did in the entirety of his first term. Someone just end this!",Torracattos,2025-05-03T00:22:02,1
"It absolutely is a violation of the first amendment! He's doing this because PBS and NPR is supposedly ""too biased"". What, and Faux News isn't? You aren't entitled to only positive media coverage. I've never seen someone with such thin skin. This man is completely incapable of handling any form of criticism. Fuck him!",Torracattos,2025-05-03T00:25:40,1
