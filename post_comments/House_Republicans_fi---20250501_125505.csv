The only investigations they will do involves political opponents.,thieh,2025-05-01T12:58:43,35

"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbF0EKVduNc&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbF0EKVduNc&t=1s)  If anyone wants an efficient telling of most of the corruption we've seen in the first 100 days, Sen Murphy manages to get it down to 26 minutes (it's a lot to unpack, this isn't him dragging on and on).   I spend a LOT of time trying to keep up with the goings on in DC, and there was a lot he caught I was oblivious to. I've been too focused on the culture war and immigration.",anemone_within,2025-05-01T14:10:25,11
Senator Chris Murphy went to the Senate floor to describe the corruption for the last 100+ days. It's worth a watch.,trublueprogressive,2025-05-01T13:26:33,8
Partisan shitheads will do partisan shithead things... Who knew?,arlondiluthel,2025-05-01T13:00:23,8
I guess it’s not much of a challenge with it being documented multiple times daily by reliable sources every day Trump as held office.,voice_of_Sauron,2025-05-01T14:37:41,2

Spineless. They have bent the knee and kissed the nasty ass🤷‍♂️😳🤢,Cha0s4201,2025-05-01T15:17:10,1
"That's my problem bro, they wanna have a fucking ""Pelosi act"" against insider trading in congress but of the top 10 highest net worth individuals in congress like 8 of them are republicans.  And the thing is is that most dems are in agreement with the bill. But they talk as though they're not and this has not ever been proposed but AOC and Bernie are literally rallying on the same agenda.  And then these bills they do usually have loopholes for their side to still profit off of it, like the 3 term bullcrap.  And the lack of accountability within their own. Dems have criticized the insider trading for decades within their own but they don't bring up the fact that MTG was verifiably trading off the tarrifs.",Competitive_Ad_5134,2025-05-02T00:32:17,1
Because they already have all the details.  No fact finding will be needed. /s,thieh,2025-05-01T13:15:37,6
