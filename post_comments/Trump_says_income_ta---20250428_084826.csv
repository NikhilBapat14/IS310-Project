"I'd love that, but the messaging is super inconsistent. Are the tariffs being used to get free trade agreements in place or are the tariffs staying in place as an income generation mechanism? This has been the administrations worst aspect as far as communication. Regardless of what the answer is, be consistent with the messaging and delivery.",Spartanlegion117,2025-04-28T09:05:59,701

"Elimination is impossible unless we are also eliminating social security, Medicare and Medicaid.   Cuts I doubt too because plausible tariff income is overwhelmed by loss of other tax revenue from reduction in economic growth and asset values (lower stock prices mean less capital gains and rsu income for the wealthy who I assume wouldn’t get 0 income tax under this cut plan)",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-28T09:11:59,246
The president has the power to unilaterally manipulate tariffs but not to change tax law. How does he propose to get tax elimination through congress?,lll_lll_lll,2025-04-28T12:05:10,75

A tariff credit against earned income?,thinkingisthehardest,2025-04-28T21:06:15,1
"That seems fairer - I'd love to see the government cut back so they don't need as much money as they (seem to think they) do, but replacing income (and property!) taxes with consumptions taxes seems like a more reasonable way to collect revenue.  If you don't want to, or can't afford to, pay taxes, you can cut back on taxed or tariffed goods.  I doubt he's going to succeed in eliminating or even reducing the income tax, though, and even if he does, it'll be reverted by the next administration - but the tariffs will stay, too.",gauntvariable,2025-04-28T12:52:05,-8
Thank you Mr. President!  Cuts always stimulate the economy!,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-28T10:23:40,-77
"Was thinking similarly. Also heard tariffs would pay down the debt. I doubt it would do all three. As much as my libertarian soul wants to eliminate income tax, we \*need\* to pay down the debt.!",AthwartHistory68,2025-04-28T09:50:55,158
"I think of it (presently at least) like this:  \-The tariffs are a punishment, but there will probably be some of them that remain in place for his whole administration (at a certain locked number) due to negotiations.  \-DOGE will keep finding ways to cut fat within the approved budgets they have to work with.  \-Congress will hopefully look at the waste DOGE has uncovered and start to pass smaller budgets.  \-So the permanent tariffs we get added together with the DOGE savings added together with smaller budgets is where the sweet spot of figuring out income tax reductions can come in.  \-Yeah, we want to pay down our debt, but at the same time *this* generation is having insanely high mortgages and rent because of what *previous* generations did and *this* generation needs help, not just the *next* generation. We can't wait to lower taxes until the debt is paid off. We need to have some kind of compromise where some of the savings go towards reducing the debt and some go towards helping citizens out.",CountBleckwantedlove,2025-04-28T09:57:06,-78

if it's only 15B then its clearly not that big of an impact on the economy at all. You're saying for 15 Billion dollars we could have subsidized US manufacturing to the point where china wouldnt be competitive? Cause isn't that the goal?,Aromat_Junkie,2025-04-28T12:40:54,-20
"I would add that this impacts the lower and middle class more than the wealthy. A much higher percentage of our spending goes to the consumption of general goods, offset by increasing costs passed down from the importer paying the tariffs.",check_your_bias7,2025-04-28T09:29:12,172
Is he talking about SS and Medicare tax?  Or just the Federal income tax?  It sounds like the latter...,CallMeCassandra,2025-04-28T10:42:52,8
"Social security and Medicare are not funded with income tax.  They are funded with payroll tax (not sure about Medicaid.)  I would say at this point that it's way, way, way too early to get excited or upset, either way.

What? I am saying all of his tariffs hit a record revenue generation of a measly 15 billion. That is never going to replace the payroll tax which generates something like 1.5 trillion dollars in Federal revenue. It’s a 1000x disparity.,LemartesIX,2025-04-28T13:42:08,35
He’s talking about the latter but that’s my analysis nonetheless. We are extremely dependent upon FIT.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-28T10:56:02,28
You are incorrect. Social security is 100b in the hole a year and draws from its trust fund which basically means deficit spending as it’s a line item on the internal federal balance sheet. New debt is issued to pay it.  Medicaid is 900b a year and has no payroll tax.  Medicare part A is over funded by 25b but the other parts aren’t and have a shortfall of 750  So we basically need about 1.7 trillion a year beyond the payroll taxes to pay for this. That’s what federal income tax is doing a lot of. It keeps getting worse too because we passed a bunch of laws that stifle competition and innovation in health care and keep letting local hospital monopolies jack up prices. It’s our least efficient industry and our most government funded and controlled one.  You know what else consistently exceeds the inflation rate of everything else and is mostly government funded and also heavily controlled by government policy?

"The US imported $4 trillion worth of goods in 2022. If we wanted to fund the federal government only using tariffs, the average rate would have to be 150% which would greatly reduce the amount of goods imported. There's no way to fund the federal government with tariffs unless we greatly reduce government spending.",GirlsWasteXp,2025-04-28T09:53:33,118

"I am absolutely not incorrect.  I am talking about on your paycheck, that is where the money for SS and MI is deducted (though after looking back at my own words, I see where I was unclear).  I am not talking about the overall funding; I am talking about where it shows up on your paycheck (again, I was unclear).  However, if you choose to carry the discussion beyond that one point I was making, carry it to someone else, please.",tengris22,2025-04-29T11:28:07,1
"Yes and the imports will drop under that tariff rate so you’d not see that. You might see 1 trillion at most of imports, probably less, and a large economic falloff greatly reducing corp tax, payroll taxes, wealthy income and capital gains taxes. You’d also see a big increase in Medicare, section 8 and unemployment spending from all the unemployment.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-28T10:26:23,45

Those deductions don’t pay for that much of it. Income tax does. We can’t cut income tax to 0 or near it unless we either don’t have a military or don’t have those programs or cut them a lot.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-29T12:11:40,3
"OK, I guess I'm STILL being unclear.  Whatever those deductions pay for is immaterial. I am talking about HOW THEY SHOW UP ON YOUR PAYCHECK.  To wit:  even if federal income tax is reduced to zero, you will still have deductions for SS and MI",tengris22,2025-04-29T12:23:25,1
