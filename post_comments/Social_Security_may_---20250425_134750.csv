The end of democracy starts when our institutions are being destroyed.  Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. He must be removed from office to save our country ASAP.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-25T14:02:20,10
"It's not ""may"" it's ""will"". They will lose thousands more staff, because that's what Trump promised.   He's made it clear that he's committed to firing federal employees across all government agencies. He's destroying all the mechanisms that keep the wheels of democracy and society turning.   He promised his supporters this and they voted for it. And they won't care until they don't get their checks.",kingofcrosses,2025-04-25T14:29:59,9
"The silver lining is that losing Social Security might be the one and only thing that gets Republican voters to demand action from Congress.  Congress is too afraid of MAGA backlash, but red state voters actually going hungry and homeless may tip the scales in the other direction.",act17,2025-04-25T14:20:55,2

"The only remaining question is when the checks stop coming in, are they going to die for the cult, or are they going to wake up?  I want to be hopeful that this will be a turning point, but all my faith in humanity has been shattered.",act17,2025-04-25T14:41:20,5
"Yeah honestly I want to believe that they'll wake up.   But I know it's much more likely that Trump will just blame someone else for taking their money, and they'll hang on to every word.",kingofcrosses,2025-04-25T14:50:06,3
It's going to be wild seeing boomers out on the street while still screaming it's Obama's fault somehow.,act17,2025-04-25T14:55:50,1
