I'm originally from one of the Mountain West states with all the federal land. Most people there don't really want federal land to get into state hands/be sold because they know that basically means cut off access and using our favorite places to extract wealth.

"I have just ridden my motorcycle through OR, NV, AZ, UT, ID and back home to WA, again.  There is, almost literally, nothing out there, the land is generally completely inhospitable: baked dry, poor soil or lava fields, no water, no infrastructure except slab freeway, isolated communities left over from days long past. Much of it seems completely inaccessible. Some of it is, however, quite beautiful, for example the North East corner of OR around Baker City as just one example.  It is hard to imagine any use for much of this beyond solar and wind farms, especially as climate change progresses. Which leads me to conclude that this action will merely lead to the expansion of the current “heat islands”, like Reno, Vegas and Phoenix, the loss of the more attractive areas to Billionaire bunkers, shutting out the people’s access, and endless legal fights over water rights.

Wilderness is important, of course, but in a future of renewable energy and climate change, if some of that land can provide services to the people then that does not seem completely unreasonable to me.

"Your comment stuck with my while I was making breakfast and for some reason I really started thinking about it. My kneejerk reaction was that I'm talking about nature, you're talking about urban communities so they're totally different things - but these processes are actually really similar and your response here is totally logical. But... I feel like there are two levels to these processes. (And apologize if this is too much, I teach geography and am too into these things).  In both nature and the urban context, the government could claim eminent domain and take over. At that level, we could reclaim either the freeway or partially developed rural land, sure. My first comment was focused on this level and so wasn’t quite communicating the main point... and that being said, the spatial scales and current times would make buybacks of 1000s of subdivided acres more complicated now than it was in the 60s or 70s when eminent domain claimed was used to displace urban neighborhoods.  But I also think it's true in both cases that after doing that - what's there before couldn't be restored - and that's part of what I was pointing out for rural/natural areas. Obviously that's true for urban areas too - say the government has claimed a large section of a neighborhood/split a neighborhood in two to build a freeway, then the freeway is built, then it's decided that the government shouldn't have done that. What ends up being built in that space? Is it the same landowners, buildings, and community as before? I can't imagine it would be. It might be a new park, or new apartment blocks, etc... but it's not going to be the same houses and people that were there before. Same goes for open space/nature/wasteland whatever you want to call it in nature - it could be sold off and then reclaimed by the government and made public again, but what's there will not (on any reasonable time scale) return to what was there before.",kingburrito,2025-05-09T10:30:12,2

"The rot that you’re speaking of has been the results of an incredibly long game that started in the 70s, and the damage that has been done will still be under repair when I’m Trumps age.  (I’m 50ish)  I’m pretty clear eyed on how we got here.    The OC was “Americans are doing nothing” and I will still contend that is flatly wrong.   The administration is being sued every time they do something and largely losing.   Large protests are underway.  General strikes are being called for by even some editorials in traditionally  conservative media like WSJ and Financial Times.  Our media is largely captured by capitalistic interests, an inherit feature of fascism/authoritarianism, and not widely reporting dissent in every day people.  This country has been incredibly damaged in a short time span.  The people are more aware than you’re being lead to believe.   We may be a largely ignorant people but we aren’t dumb.
