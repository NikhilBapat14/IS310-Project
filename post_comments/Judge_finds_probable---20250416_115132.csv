A Salvadoran citizen was returned to El Salvador. He has no legal right to be in the U.S. liberals are actually insane that this is the hill they want to die on (similar to raging about wanting men to play and compete against women in sports).,WannabeBadGalRiri,2025-04-16T16:14:45,10
The judge whom the Supreme Court said didn't even have jurisdiction to rule on the matter? That's like being charged with resisting arrest AFTER a judge ruled the reason for the traffic stop was unconstitutional. Wild.,Jerrywelfare,2025-04-16T15:45:27,136

"Where does a federal judge get the authority to order the executive branch to return of an illegal el Salvador citizen from the sovereign nation of el Salvador?

Completely forgot about this Venezuela plane story already tbh. It was a completely different incident of a federal judge ordering illegal immigrant gang members to be brought back to America. Really getting hard to keep track of.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T13:22:40,2

I'd say immediately do that.   Josh Blackman says this could be Mueller gate all over again.   Trump will fire these people and the lemmings will scream obstruction.
