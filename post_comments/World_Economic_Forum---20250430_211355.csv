" ""The support for Western secession is therefore growing, unabated and even fueled by Liberal promises to reverse many of their previous positions. Such promises of expediency simply don't ring true in the West,"" continued Manning. ""Who, except the most politically naive, would believe Mark Carney's promises to reverse the Liberal positions on everything from east-west pipelines to identity politics and climate change, when standing behind him is a cabinet of 23 MPs who, just a month ago, were advocating for the very opposite and have done so for years?""  The former opposition leader noted further that while the bottom-up support for western secession is currently centered on the oil-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, ""it has the potential to spread to most of B.C., Manitoba, and the adjacent territories depending on how it is organized and led.""  A day after the federal election, Alberta lawmakers introduced legislation that would make it easier to start a referendum, including one on separating from Canada, reported CityNews.  The bill lowers the threshold for a citizen-led referendum from 20% of eligible voters to 10% and affords campaigners 120 days rather than 90 days to secure signatures.  'Now is the time to end the abusive and toxic relationship with Ottawa.'  ""I believe in Alberta sovereignty within a united Canada,"" said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. ""However, there is a citizen referenda process that if citizens want to put a question on a ballot and get enough of their fellow citizens to sign that petition, then those questions will be put forward. Again, I don't want to prejudge what a question might be.""  While Smith is apparently not a separatist, Alberta â€” home to the fourth-largest proven oil reserves in the world â€” has its fair share who might vote to leave.  When pollsters from the Angus Reid Institute asked Albertans whether they would vote to leave Canada if the Liberals were to form the next government, 30% of respondents said yes. Notably, even more Saskatchewan respondents â€” 33% â€” expressed interest in leaving the federation behind.  Cameron Davies, the leader of the Republican Party of Alberta, formerly the Buffalo Party of Alberta, is reportedly planning hundreds of town halls to seize upon this discontent and to promote secession.  Western Canada might be ready to leave Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T23:47:35,13
"I love the whole ""Canada was going to be conservative until Trump"". No, Canada will always be liberal. The WEF controls their elections so they can install their Quislings",AppState1981,2025-05-01T07:38:08,8
