"Yeah this needs to be squashed by SCOTUS. US law, not some abject religious law.   “But Christianity!!” Yes and Christian biblical law doesn’t run things here either. Separation of church and state.   Muslims must all be subject to US and state law or leave, just like Jews, just like Christians.",ITrCool,2025-04-24T22:26:27,33
"Better nip this in the bud. Britain already has a two-tiered legal system. If a British Muslim refuses to participate in a Sharia court, they are considered an apostate....punishable by death. Of course no Sharia court in Britain would impose such a sentence, but the family and community will ostracize him or her....and an individual Muslim might decide to act to impose the penalty on their own personal initiative. In fact, ""apostasy"" (rejecting Islamic norms/traditions) is the reason for so many so-called 'honor killings' both in the West and in Darul Islam.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-25T06:34:07,11
