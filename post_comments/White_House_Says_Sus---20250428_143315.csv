The White House says it is open to the idea of suspending the writ of habeas corpus — or the right to challenge one’s detention — for migrants as the administration looks to speed up its mass deportation operation. The admission came on Monday morning as border tsar Tom Homan took to the White House press podium to highlight the administration’s efforts to deport migrants charged with crimes in the United States.   Read more: [https://www.nysun.com/article/white-house-says-suspending-writ-of-habeas-corpus-to-speed-up-mass-deportations-is-open-to-discussion?member\_gift=CUZ5qwd3crq4pmz-xrd](https://www.nysun.com/article/white-house-says-suspending-writ-of-habeas-corpus-to-speed-up-mass-deportations-is-open-to-discussion?member_gift=CUZ5qwd3crq4pmz-xrd),TheNewYorkSun,2025-04-28T14:33:36,124

"From the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/writ-of-habeas-corpus.html): > King John’s Magna Carta guaranteed to all free men immunity from illegal imprisonment, a guarantee that has traditionally been invoked by way of the writ of habeas corpus. Under the concept of habeas corpus in Anglo-American jurisprudence, persons who are deprived of their liberty have the right to challenge the legality of their arrest or detention through a judicial inquiry. Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “produce the body.” By means of the writ of habeas corpus a court may order the state to “produce the body,” or hand over a prisoner so that it might review the legality of the prisoner’s detention.  > Although King John’s Magna Carta did guarantee protection from unlawful imprisonment, it did not establish a process by which a person might sue for his freedom. The association between Magna Carta’s protection and the writ of habeas corpus only took root in the seventeenth century following the conflict between the House of Commons and King Charles I, after which the writ of habeas corpus became one of the most important privileges associated with English liberties. It was reaffirmed in the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1640 and 1679 and appears frequently in discussions of constitutional rights throughout the era leading to American independence. It is one of the fundamental liberties mentioned in the body of the United States Constitution.",aleph32,2025-04-28T15:23:37,22

It's worth noting one of these was in the Philippines and not really what we could consider to be USA proper.   Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in US history: during the Civil War, in South Carolina to combat the Ku Klux Klan, in the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection, and in Hawaii during World War II.   Elaboration:  Civil War:  President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus throughout the Union, particularly in cases of war, espionage, and treason.   South Carolina:  In 1868, habeas corpus was suspended in nine counties of South Carolina to quell the activities of the Ku Klux Klan.   Philippines:  The writ was suspended in two provinces of the Philippines in 1905 during an insurrection, according to the National Constitution Center.   Hawaii:  During World War II, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii.    For some more information, this is what the constitution says on the topic;   Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the Constitution states: ""The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."" ",rawbdor,2025-04-28T17:23:35,67

"You're referring to ""returns"" and ""expedited removals"", that's people turned away at the border or people who are found within 100 miles of the border within about 2 weeks of crossing. But Im referring to ""interior removals"". These are people arrested and deported from outside the 100 mile range and usually with an established life here. BCP and DHS arrested people wherever they could find them, including via home raids. The priority was people with criminal records, but at the beginning of his first term, only half of interior removals had criminal records. By the end of his presidency, that figure was closer to 85%.   In the chaos of an accelerated deportation effort, many women and children with no criminal record were scooped up and detained and deported without access to counsel. BCP and HHS did endruns around due process in lots of ways, with a particular favorite tactic being Notices to Appear that did not list a time or place for the hearing. Then when the person didn't show up, the judge issued a ""removal in absentia"" and ordered the person arrested and deported, often with no avenue for appeal or legal means to rectify mistakes. This happened to hundreds of thousands during Obama's presidency.   **I am not trying to say both sides are the same**. I'm a huge fan of Obama, and I'm whatever the extreme opposite of that is for the orange asshole.  I am ONLY pointing out this history because this echo chamber can make everything seem like the end of the world. And the result is people giving up.

"You’re right that both administrations had issues with deportation, but Trump took things to a whole new level. Obama’s policies were flawed, especially with how some people got deported without due process. Yes, what you’re describing technically fell within the framework of U.S. immigration law but it exposed just how flawed, cruel, and manipulable that framework already was.  What Trump did differently was exploit those same systems  and promise to supercharge them with fewer restraints, more cruelty, and explicit authoritarian goals. He made what was already harsh into a central political weapon. Trump went further by aggressively targeting families, stripping away legal protections, and putting people in dangerous situations.   I also voted for Obama and I was angry then too. That’s what I’m saying. NEVER in my life did I think we would round up immigrants and send them to a foreign prison.   Trump didn’t just push existing laws harder, he weaponized them, using law enforcement like a tool to harm people and push an agenda. His approach wasn’t about following the law, it was about dismantling any checks on his power, which is where things crossed a line into authoritarianism. So, while Obama’s administration had its issues, Trump’s actions were on another level entirely, and that’s where the real danger lies.  The issue is most of us, like you and I already know what previous administrations did. Hell, democrats are their own loudest critics. The issue is the ones defending Trump with the whataboutism.

I had the same thought after watching the Wyoming rep telling her constituents that they were wrong to feel that Trump’s actions were hurting them.  There will come a point where the representatives will fear the people more than they fear Trump. I worry that it will take an escalation of tension and a loss of personal safety to make them open their eyes to the reality.   The same will happen with the icestapo raids. Someone will stand up to them or defend themselves and things will escalate dramatically. Things are on a low simmer now but there is a lot of tension below the surface and the potential for a rolling boil probably isn’t far behind.,clovisx,2025-04-29T04:49:34,1

"History has shown us? Seriously?   Can you comment on the previous 4 uses of suspending the writ of habeous corpus and honestly tell me that all 4 of them were unjustified and never should have happened?   Do you honestly believe that Lincoln, during the civil war, should not have been able to stop defectors from hurting the union army position? Or that Lincoln should have been forced to have trials for these people in the middle of the war? That such a thing would not have hurt morale in the north?   Can you honestly tell me that we should not have suspended habeus corpus in Hawaii during WW2? The island was critical to our asian staging and any dissent there would have had absolutely deleterious effects on our country's position in the war, possibly even the loss of the island?   Can you tell me that President Grant, 6 years after the end of the Civil War, had no sufficient grounds to suspend Habeus Corpus in those targeted and limited 9 counties in South Carolina, counties which were in an obvious and open state of rebellion, with racial violence running wild, and with freed slaves still being sold on the courthouse steps?   Can you honestly tell me that, a mere 4 years after taking control of the Phillipines, the area having been in a constant state of unrest and rebellion, and at the request of the Phillipines government, whose charter allowed to request the USA to suspend habeus corpus, was unreasonable?   Every single one of the past uses showed a state in extreme unrest or rebellion. The current case, today, is Trump trying to engineer a state of unrest and rebellion.   I think the evidence shows that suspension of habeus corpus has been used responsibly and sparingly throughout history, often targeted to the smallest relevant areas possible.   The problem is not in the ability to suspend habeus corpus during actual invasion or rebellion. The problem is with the choice in President.  When you weaken your governments ability to handle drastic and unprecedented challenges, then when those challenges arrive, the nation will be powerless to prevent itself being ripped apart from the inside.  The solution is to make Congress's approval part of the requirement. If the problem is drastic, Congress will move to act and approve the suspension.",rawbdor,2025-04-28T20:25:30,7

"Ignore the personalities. Pretend it's a board game.   An organization that cannot do things like suspend habeus corpus during an actual invasion will quickly fall to infighting during a critical time. In fact, during an invasion or rebellion it is almost guaranteed that whoever is invading or rebelling will likely be the ones to exploit the right to habeus corpus, and then use their freedom and stage to publicly destroy confidence in the union.   Any country that does not have the right to suspend habeus corpus during extreme emergencies is a country that soon won't exist, and when the country ceases to exist, it's fragmented parts that find themselves now a country of their own will quickly realize what led to the union's disintegration, and will immediately suspend habeus corpus in their own state to avoid a similar fate.   The fact that you don't realize this or not acknowledge it is a huge problem.   If the USA could never ever suspend habeus corpus, during an invasion or rebellion, the invaders or revellers will sow discontent and distrust to prevent the union from remaining unified. The USA would quickly fall apart. Then you would have 50 independent states.   Then, New York, having seen how the USA fell apart, would quickly suspend habeus corpus to restore order and the to avoid a similar fate, as would North Carolina, and Texas, and California, and others.   And should any state NOT realize the danger, and leave writs of habeus corpus active, their neighbors would immediately begin to sow distrust in that state.   Say Pennsylvania decides it will keep habeus corpus alive. Well, New York would immediately maneuver to secure PA in an alliance. In an effort to prevent such an alliance, Ohio might attempt to sow distrust of New York within Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania will, itself, see itself at risk of being carved into two.   At that point, Pennsylvania would either allow itself to be chopped in half, and thus cease to exist as an independent state, or it would realize the peril it faced, and suspend habeus corpus itself, in order to preserve its own territorial integrity.   This has absolutely nothing to do with the rich white slave owners. It's a matter of game theory. Any institution not strong enough to prevent itself being cut into pieces will soon stop existing, as stronger and more unified entities rip it to pieces and claim parts of it for themselves.   The ability to suspend habeus corpus is a critical power that is  ideally never required to be used. Any government lacking this power, and committed to maintaining it that way, essentially invites it's neighbors and enemies to come take it over and rip it to shreds.   A corporation that cannot pass a poison pill clause to its bylaws will find itself helpless in the face of their enemies or competitors, who see no risk and no downside to attempting a hostile takeover. If it works, great. If it doesn't, well, the corporation can't even pass a poison pill, so there's no risk at all!   It doesn't matter if we are talking about large nations, small nations, nations run by rich, nations run by poor, communist nations, or ancap nations. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a nonprofit, or a charity, a social club, or wikipedia.   Any organization that purposely denies itself the tools needed to maintain its independence and unity will quickly find their independence and unity no longer exists.",rawbdor,2025-04-28T22:39:40,1
