"You have these zero-click spyware like Pegasus that's sold by contractors like NSO Groups out there where well-connected individuals or foreign government can buy these kits from privately owned companies to spy on people. And they've seen these being abused by private individuals all over the Middle East and Dubai to keep track of people like their ex-wifes when they're fleeing to other countries and companies like Apple let these very big holes exist on their platform for years without fixing them.   So who knows who Public Matters Pete has been inviting to his very open invitations or what phone platform they're using with Pete's friends, family, and these ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" anti-American journalists who he doesn't even know how they got there and that he's been sharing on-going 👊🇺🇸🔥 operations with and it's something that the voters need to know the extent and nature of so they can make sure individuals who are qualified can protect not only personnel but also our civilians (who are being very misMAGAtreated by the very questionable and unpopular appointees in this Trump administration)",postsshortcomments,2025-04-25T13:22:46,1

"“Zero click” implies no user interaction is required for the exploit to execute. So it’s not dependent on you “clicking” a link to goto a malicious website or something. There have been some where it’s simply “you receive a malicious text.” Exploits like this are the ones that could get a million dollar payout in a bug bounty program, but eyes on the US Secretary of Defense’s phone is worth more.",deadzol,2025-04-25T17:40:00,12
No interactions needed from a user. In this example I can send a text or iMessage that’s crafted in a way to execute code. It’ll own the device and start pulling modules/plugins it needs based on target.   All this happens while it’s in your pocket or even if you’re on the device. I’ve never seen a live demonstration so I’m not sure folks would notice other than a hiccup.    These exploits exist. They’re hoarded by state actors and now private companies. The “saving grace” with the most popular and off the shelf was thwarted targeting any US based number (e.g. +1 prefix). They agreed to not let malicious texts get sent to US numbers.   But the cat is out of the bag. Folks know they exist and they work. Every country including allies has probably been trying to get in to that phone.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-25T19:26:19,7
