The bad thing is that there's little morsels of her point in here that are correct. Which is the worst possible scenario when we're talking about MTG being a person who almost has a point.

"Large Marge is not 100% in touch with reality.  She claims that in the election ballot for 2026 ""Trump‚Äôs not on that, he‚Äôs not on the ballot in 2026‚Äù but in a very real way he definitely is.  IF they lose the mid-terms, it will be 100% a total reaction to Trump and his shenanigans. Elections are won and lost in the margins, and Trump is scaring the people in the margins right now. They will blame MAGA for what Trump is doing.  Per the article she seems to be focused on keeping MAGA promises to MAGA followers, or face the wrath of the people. But most of the MAGA chuds are obsequious sycophants in a cult, so it's ok to break promises to them because they won't notice. No one they listen to will tell them.   Those campaign promises were made specifically to MAGA because they were MAGA, the only people who were sure to ...  ‚Ä¢ believe the promises when made   and   ‚Ä¢ forget the promises when broken.  Big donors notice when promises to them are broken. The ones who are receiving phone calls from congressional representatives all over the United States and cutting big checks will notice. They are not in the cult, they have big egos and are motivated entirely by self interest. That's why their agenda is on top.  The latest Republican tax plan still has taxes on tips, still has taxes on overtime, still has taxes on Social Security. But it has tax cuts for the big donors.",Hesychios,2025-05-05T13:01:06,40

"I do think that the republicans are going to lose ""bigly"" in the next primaries. My only thought is they are trying to support Trump gaining total authoritarian power and not have elections even be a thing in the future. I actually don't think that'll happen, but barring that, there is not a chance in the world that congress won't be blue by a significant margin come 2026 elections.   Democrats and independents are completely fed up by now, and republicans are starting to lose faith except for the true believers who can't be swayed by anything. Thankfully there aren't enough of them to overcome the massive momentum against trump.

If stores suddenly stop offering a ton of variety of products and prices increase significantly.... AND tons of Americans lose their jobs because we are in a recession/depression... The non voters are going to notice... and go vote.... except they won't vote for the Republicans... they will vote against them because the Republicans are the ones that caused the issues with the economy.,Darth_Groot28,2025-05-05T16:13:38,1

Historically, debt ceiling increases have been used as an opportunity to enact deficit reduction or facilitate budget reforms ‚Äì but this budget would allow $2.8 trillion in deficit increases under the House‚Äôs instructions and $5.8 trillion under the Senate‚Äôs instructions.  The allowed debt limit increase ‚Äì $4 trillion in the House and up to $5 trillion in the Senate ‚Äì would be the largest specified increase in history.1 The previous largest dollar increase was $2.5 trillion, which was a standalone measure to raise the debt ceiling at the end of 2021.

It's almost impossible for there not to be with an organization as enormous and sprawling as the government. *Enter DOGE, the worst possible solution to that problem.*   *- It's true* that, while not a crisis, our immigration system has been broken for quite some time and in need of some serious reform. *Enter Trump 2.0's Immigration Policy, the worst possible solution to that problem.*   *- It's true* that there can be a fundamental unfairness to biological males competing in women's sports under certain circumstances. *Enter Trump's LGBTQ+ policies, the worst possible solution to that infinitesimally small problem.*   *- It's true* that there are some adjustments that could be made regarding our net import / export metrics and the degree to which the US props up the global economy. *Enter Trump's tariff policies, the worst possible solution to that problem.*   This can go on virtually forever, on any GOP policy on anything.

He ran on improving the economy to secure those voters.  For his MAGA base, Trump ran primarily on culture war issues. Most of his public performative transgressions are a tactic he uses to rile up this base.   Trumps problem is his populist base is aging (just MAGA). Half of them are already over the age 65. These are people who grew up in a different time and are totally distraught over the cultural changes which have captivated the younger generations. They're worried about their traditions, values and perceived cultural decline, which strongly motivate them at the polls.      However, it is going to become increasingly untenable for right wing politicians to double down on a shrinking base. Polls suggest younger conservatives and independents have very different priorities then the older MAGA base.

">There's no way the still vote yes on trump stuff dems are going to impeach and remove him.  They might. At least some are voting yes on on stuff they know is going to pass anyway in an (almost certainly futile) attempt to play nice to get some Republicans to maybe be willing to work with them later or on other stuff. So their voting habits might chance with a Dem majority and/or once they accept that the Republicans aren't doing anything at all in good faith.  With a Dem majority, I could definitely see impeachment happening. I don't see *removal* happening, but that's regardless of whether or not all Dems vote for it - it'd almost certainly need a number of Republicans voting for it.

"Well, I would argue instead that the trend was less ‚Äútoward the right‚Äù and more so ‚Äúaway from the establishment‚Äù, wherever that establishment may have been at the given time.  People elected left wing leaders in 2020 to deal with Covid, because in crises like that, people tend to reach for more government action. However, that meant that the blame for the subsequent economic issues(supply chains, inflation) was placed that their feet, even if they were inevitable. So they got the blame and it just so happened that they home was put on incumbents who just so happened to be left wing.  The obvious outliers being nations like Britain who saw the ousting of the establishment conservatives after their handling of Covid and the subsequent economic fallout.

"Yeah, that's absolutely true. That's also why I do have some hope for our future though - after the 90s and economic reforms, 2000-2012 was actually a pretty good time for Russia, and a lot of young people who grew up then in the urban cities were able to travel a lot and see the world for the first time. It's ended up a big problem for Putin, which explains why the government is so eager for the liberal youth to flee Russia - he'd much rather they go and become someone else's problem than his. Like, I know one family who were quite active protestors - organizers, doing fundraisers, etc. They told me one day the FSB broke into their house, confiscated any valuables, and basically told them: either sell your house and leave Russia, or we will make your life a suffering. They left less than a month later.   Right now it's impossible to do anything - the control is just too tight. But we still have a strong technocracy, and a lot of teenagers becoming adults who feel like their bright futures have been ripped away from them.

Putin took power while improving economic conditions too.  It's a big part of his control.  It's why he cannot stop his current war.
