This sort of thing works in the private sector because basically the only people impacted are the employees that are let go  But when it comes to government not doing downsizing with care just fucks over citizens,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-08T11:37:13,11
"When I worked at USDA, an Obama political appointee named Ramona Romero did the same thing understand sequestration. More people retired or found another job in areas where she hadn’t planned for employees to leave the agency. It was a real eye opener to me that there were no political consequences to her for what appeared to me to be mismanagement. When I see it happening again under the Trump regime, I think now that there is a systemic problem with incompetence in key government positions.",FiveUpsideDown,2025-05-08T12:09:22,3
Not even that - show me the year of severance I'm eligible for on day 1 and I'll consider applying.  Suddenly government jobs are highly volatile and risky. You'd have to offer me a nice set of golden handcuffs to walk anywhere near that situation with 3.5 years left on the GOP clock.,HexTalon,2025-05-09T02:01:38,1
