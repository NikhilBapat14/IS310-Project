"People don't realize it, but there is a huge drive by evangelical stay-at-home moms to homeschool. They organize and do it together with other church moms, using the church as the school and usually none of them are college educated or have any real clue what they are doing. I've had them explain to me that they want to get their hands on public school money, that they church homeschool could replace our public schools.  It's a real thing in rural America. I know how it sounds, almost illegal, but it's real and it's a bigger movement than you think.",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T18:47:29,1
"A separate analysis by Texas Tech University in 2024 found **Texas students lost about three months in math instruction and four months in reading** with uncertified teachers who had no prior classroom experience, compared to peers with certified teachers.     https://www.k12dive.com/news/hiring-uncertified-teachers-research-staffed-up/738694/#:\~:text=A%20separate%20analysis%20by%20Texas,to%20peers%20with%20certified%20teachers.     So, for Republicans who say they want to ""improve education"", this flies right in the face of that. Everything Republicans are doing with regards to education are counterproductive. They are not helping in any way with regards to education. They are spitting in the face of educators, saying that basically education is worthless to them and not worth the investment. Terrible.",southpawFA,2025-04-07T18:32:17,1

Eliminates class-size limits AND hiring unlicensed teachers.  Have FUN with that combo!!!,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-07T18:52:17,1
"The fact that people in this country aren't revolting over the current state of public education is crazy to me, and not just in plces like NC, but also in places like california and massachusettes. The whole system is broken from top to bottom and everyone knows it yet we all just continue on as though everything is fine. The same thing can be said about a dozen other problems we currently face. It's amazing how we all just accept the status quo despite knowing how terrible it is. ",Bakedads,2025-04-07T18:35:07,1

"It really is. Every parent I know personally is doing this now. It's insane. They have no idea what they're doing either. They think they have a grip on it until one day, when they're going to realize their kids can't do the work because it's too advanced for homeschooling. My spouse's family pulled this with their kids & royally screwed them by giving up in the HS years (the work was too complicated & a lot of those religious/ homeschool programs only go up to 8th grade), tossing their kids to the sharks. My spouse said it was shocking, disorienting, lonely, awkward, discouraging, etc., because most kids make friends earlier on, are farther along with education, have social skills they didn't, etc. Guess it was ugly, so much so, my spouse always speaks against doing it. Not that people listen though. ",Internal-War-9947,2025-04-07T19:34:07,1
"I know it's important to give factual arguments and quote seemingly obvious studies, but come on...

"They're already doing that. Next time you're at the hospital you might want to ask the person passing their self off as a doctor what their credentials are. There's a reasonable chance it's a nurse. They have a shortage of doctors, so they let nurses with a two-year degree take the place of a doctor with 15 years of training.
