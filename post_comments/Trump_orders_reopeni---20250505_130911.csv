"Funny he mentions this.  I don‚Äôt know where he got the idea, most likely from television.  But sometimes at night, to help me sleep, I think of an island for the cruelest people in power, to live on.  I am not sadistic.  Beds, toilets, water, food.  But essentially exile with each other.  Not starving or thirst or cold.  Just time with each other on the island.  And no off-island communication.  Just a bunch of power drunk men living together.  No harm, pretty decent living conditions, but only each other for company.  Kind of weird.  Am I on the same bandwidth as Trump?  Not a fan of that idea.  Is it some distant memory of Napoleon?  Is North Sentinel island too much information?",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-05T13:14:38,2

That's the funny part. You could dump all the money in the world into renovating it and you would still be left with an overpriced substandard prison by today's standards... Not even substandard in terms of the conditions that the inmates would be in - Prisons have been reworked a lot since those days for the safety of the guards and to mitigate escape attempts.  Not that anyone expects that Trump knows these things... Or that he would even care if he did.,Grey_0ne,2025-05-05T13:38:09,3
