Trump is going to pull some Oval Office shenanigans with  Vance like with Zelenskyy.  I can see it now.,falsekoala,2025-05-04T15:55:30,24
"After reading this thread;  No, he won’t research what will set Trump off and trigger him.  He won’t get Zelensky’d.   He won’t make Trump come to him.   He WILL wear a suit.  He won’t be a ‘pussy’.  Copying something I posted earlier:  > Carney is an extremely well educated and experienced economist who attended Harvard on scholarship and earned his PhD at Oxford. He was the first non-Brit to head the Bank of England, then the Bank of Canada (where he was largely credited with Canada’s financial recovery during the 2008 recession) From 2011-18, Carney chaired the Financial Stability Board (which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency)  He’s going to do what Canada elected him to do; put his country in the best possible position to succeed, or at least survive, this Administration and the threats it poses.",__dilligaf__,2025-05-04T17:04:13,12
I hope he's doing research into everything that will offend Trump and just does all of that.,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-04T16:06:51,5
"So where is this meeting going to take place?  Carney SHOULD NOT go to Trump, the meeting should take place in Canada.",BioticVessel,2025-05-04T15:58:41,6
"Dude should bring Trump a gift. Does Hallmark have a 'thank you for getting me elected with your insane rants about annexing us,' section?",travio,2025-05-04T16:10:56,3
Carney should up front tell him to fuck off. Now that would be awesome. And there would be ZERO Trump could do about it. Trump's already fucked himself on this one. Do it Carney.,williamgman,2025-05-04T17:37:52,2
Poor Carney It’s like visiting a kindergarten,MiniMini662,2025-05-04T19:04:18,1
"Let's see what terrible deals Trump will agree/make just so he can say he got a ""win"" over Canada.",randomnighmare,2025-05-04T22:35:27,1
guess we will see stuff like turning canada into the 51st state here,saiyanscaris,2025-05-04T16:27:17,0
"If he does, I wonder if Carney just stands up and leaves.  That would send quite the message.  Especially if it is televised.",Codes1985,2025-05-04T16:47:26,15
"As a Canadian, I almost hope he tries. Carney has proven to be pretty cut and dry and has called out bad-faith press questions for what they are in the past. He will also fact-check Trump without a second thought. I would anticipate this meeting to be behind closed doors, though. I don't think Trump wants to be fact-checked in real time by an economist whose first language is English and shares common idioms with the US. Furthermore, it would be to Carney's benefit to be out of the spotlight so that he can be more strategic with interacting with Trump. Flattery is strategically effective against Trump, for example, but would be seen negatively by Canadians.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-04T16:57:20,10
He said it himself he has a lot to do at home and he’s not there to beg. Canada’s focus is internal and like minded trading partners.,chum_slice,2025-05-05T00:58:06,2
I hope he pulls a Macron and sets it straight on national AMERICAN TV that our deficit isn't a subsidy.,Brilliant-Slice-2049,2025-05-04T16:39:54,5
"Doubt it, most politicians are pussies. But I have been wrong before.   Hope he fucks up Trump, but doubt it",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-05-04T16:20:19,1
I hope he doesn’t wear a suit,laserdisk4life,2025-05-04T16:27:47,1
"No, I prefer Canada continues to position itself as the adult in the room.",biscuitarse,2025-05-04T16:21:52,10
I would prefer to maintain the stance of not allowing felons into our country.,AlkaSelse,2025-05-04T16:58:09,8
We do not allow Felons in Canada - it is the law so....,Vanilla_Either,2025-05-04T19:48:15,4
"During Trump's first term, Trudeau gifted Trump a photo of his grandfather's brothel...",concerned_citizen128,2025-05-04T16:33:55,7
"While cathartic, that wouldn't help Canada. I expect (and hope) for Carney to negotiate as good a relationship with Trump/USA as he can to mitigate the short-term economic burden to our country while simultaneously pivoting away from the USA and developing long-term relationships elsewhere.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-04T17:59:00,3
We need some old-fashioned Khrushchev shoe-banging.,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-04T16:24:36,1
A goalie suit.,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-04T16:29:03,2
Agreed.  But the adult could be in a room elsewhere. I think to cave to Donnie's request for a meet stacks the cards against Carney.  He's got to be careful of the changeling snake. Just sayin',BioticVessel,2025-05-04T18:57:56,1
"Yes, I understand.  But with the past talks in Donnie's playground, the talks can get out of control.  After all of Donnie's belligerence it seems a neutral meeting place would be appropriate.",BioticVessel,2025-05-04T19:00:50,0
"Where are felons allowed to travel?   Hmmm.  So if Donnie von Shitzinpants can't leave the US I would suggest that the meet be held in the state house of Minnesota.  That's South of Winnipeg, there's supportive rural in the Dakotas just to the west.  Sounds fair to me, if Minnesota will accept a felon traveling into their state.  I would've suggested Iowa, but I think the governor wants to spend the night with Donnie and that's just too much distraction.",BioticVessel,2025-05-04T20:19:51,1
The issue is what Trump has done will not be undone for years to come (after our own Nuremburg Trials). This will take a decade to undo. It's going to get worse before it gets better.,williamgman,2025-05-04T18:48:36,0
Valid. We shall have to wait and see how it goes.,AlkaSelse,2025-05-04T19:20:43,1
"I suspect the same, unfortunately.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-04T19:22:18,1
