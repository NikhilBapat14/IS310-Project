People need to opt out of religious texts,Handlestach,2025-04-22T19:50:31,28
"Are they going to opt out of books with rich protagonists as well?   Afaik, Jesus only named one group that will find it near impossible to enter heaven, and it wasn't queer folk.",RavensQueen502,2025-04-22T19:58:45,12
"If they want their kids to have a specific religious education, they can homeschool them or send them to a private school. The rest of us shouldn't have to cater to their backwards wishes.",BukkitCrab,2025-04-22T19:52:45,10
Fine. Then I can opt my children out of any Xtian stories as well as ANYTHING ELSE I DON’T LIKE. Fair is fair.,40angst,2025-04-23T07:43:58,2
"And yet ironicallly,, when atheist and agnostic Americans object to the aggressive promotion of evangelical Xtianity in all aspects of our society, they are quick to remind them that “freedom of religion” doesn’t mean “freedom from religion”.",NoOffenseImJustSayin,2025-04-22T20:04:20,4
The only book I’ve ever been forced to read was the bibble. I was also remarkably bad at book reports.,fowlraul,2025-04-22T19:52:07,2

I wish these insufferable bigots would just opt out of society at large.   I'm tired of having to accommodate there ignorant and childish views of the world.,oldfrancis,2025-04-23T10:55:55,1
Someday someone's going to have a great longitudinal study about the long-term effects of self-hermiting yourself and your families and future generations in caves of ignorance...,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-04-22T20:29:20,0
Some of the families suing are Muslim. Wonder how the Queers for Palestine group feels about this since the US has an open-door policy for Palestinians and about a quarter million live in the US.,DeflatedDirigible,2025-04-23T03:37:12,-1
This is so shitty because no one wants to be that kid in class embarrassed because they can’t participate in something because “my mom won’t let me”. If anyone these parents were paying attention to the real dangers that face their kids in their futures like impossible to pay off student loans and housing shortages,susibirb,2025-04-22T20:18:02,-2
"We already can. While this potential ruling is fucked up because it extends religious protection to non-religious bigotry, kids could opt out of ""Christmas stuff"" when I was a child many decades ago.  If you want to tell your child, your child's teacher, and your child's friends that their parents are bigots -- I guess this will work. It'll also ignite their curiosity so I'm kinda excited to see the consequences come home to roost on this one",Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T19:55:01,6
Unless you are going to a private school you aren’t reading them in a US school. And if you have a problem with your kid being exposed to religious texts at school I’m not sure why you are sending them to a private religious school in the first place.,Ready_Nature,2025-04-22T19:56:19,-4
