"By Sonam Sheth — Evening Politics Editor |  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took a hardline stance against several of President Donald Trump's claims during a somewhat contentious Oval Office meeting Tuesday, including Trump's assertion that the United States doesn't ""do much business"" with Canada.  Tuesday was Trump's first face-to-face meeting with Carney since the U.S. president launched his sweeping trade war targeting Canada, Mexico and nearly 200 other countries. It was also their first meeting since Carney won Canada's federal election after running on an anti-Trump platform.

I mean .. prime minister Carney is just SO many syllables. Could we even guarantee that he'd be able to get through all six before side tracking to Obama's woke library and the tough mean construction workers that he loves so much? /s,AlkaSelse,2025-05-06T17:30:41,2
