"Doesn’t surprise me. AI, assuming it’s a well done AI, can form more coherent sentences in a format that is easier to understand. Most people on Reddit don’t spend a ton of time on replies so their responses are much sloppier.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-28T22:20:34,3
Mmhmm. Social media and sites like this are hella creepier once you realize you might just be wasting your time arguing with an NPC. I would’ve tried on some topics a few years back. But bot infestation is so bad now that I don’t trust when engagement continues beyond a certain point. It really feels like being strung along. I’ll just let replies die now.,Szorja,2025-04-29T00:43:28,3
