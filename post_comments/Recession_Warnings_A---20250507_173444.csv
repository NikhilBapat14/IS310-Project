"Look to logistics. This article does not mention the UPS restructuring and job cuts announcement from last week. Less volume is the opportune time for such an undertaking.  From the article:  >Others argue that consumers, especially more affluent ones, are in strong enough financial shape that they will be able to keep spending, allowing businesses to pass on their higher costs and pushing up inflation.  It's almost as if 45 years of movement conservatism economics centralizing gains to the wealthy have created an affluence bubble. One in which the heirs of wealth do not have to live in the ragged recession-rerun economy of the United States like everyone else does.",localistand,2025-05-07T17:44:19,11

"Q2 results will be the measure and cannot be denied or manipulated en masse in the same way as government economic indicators.  Investors have nowhere to run to when the bond market and USD become increasingly discredited.  Both China and Japan are tapping into massive bond reserves as a means of economic support and this exacerbates sovereign risk of default along with a shrinking tax base and plans to cut it further.  Should other nations and major investors depart then the USD will no longer be seen as the reserve currency of choice.  Once it loses this economic advantage it will have great difficulty in pulling itself out of recession as it has done so often before.  Gold was also pushed up in price as result of massive gold buying by China and is now falling as it unloads and takes the profit.  It will of course rise again but could spike around Q2 as investors desert the stock market and this does the economy no favours.  In the meantime Germany has been considering withdrawal of its gold reserves from the Federal Reserve due to fears that Trump will appropriate international gold reserves.  This is , in part , due to Project 2025 having the USD reverting to the gold standard in the belief that it will favour cryptocurrency as the volatile reserve currency.  It also has the effect of circumventing the Federal Reserve ability to set and influence cash rates.  Their plans for an economic recession of the US economy in an average duration of 3.5 years was to benefit vulture capitalists.  Trump however has launched the US into an economic death spiral which could develop into a deep economic recession or worse.  I wish that I could be more optimistic but everything I see points to an entirely negative outcome without any economic or political rainbows appearing on the horizon.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-07T20:39:33,5

"The UPS announcement was blamed on reduced Amazon shipments, and then the next day Amazon announced a massive expansion of their in-house delivery operations.

"Well I guess it is standard practice to not count former government employees as unemployed if they are still receiving severance checks, which a lot of the fired workers probably are doing. But you're right that most of the 100s of thousands of fired federal workers are not showing up in the data yet. If you account for those, the headline jobs numbers go away completely. We likely won't see them actually in the data for a couple months, assuming they don't find jobs elsewhere in between.",PM_ME_UR_JUMBLIE5,2025-05-08T06:27:30,1
