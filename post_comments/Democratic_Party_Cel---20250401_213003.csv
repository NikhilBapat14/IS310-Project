Yes!! the Florida races didn't get attention because the democrat didn't win- but there was like a 20 point swing towards democrats which is massive,Zestyclose-Expert138,2025-04-01T21:37:07,712
"I wish we had better news in FL tonight, but anyone with an (R) next to their name is pretty much guaranteed to win in this state. We had a chance in 2018, very likely because of [‚Äúyou know what‚Äù](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_high_school_shooting), but the MAGA migration we had during COVID kinda sealed our fate.",bassistheplace246,2025-04-01T22:00:09,147
Thank you Wisconsin! As a floridian I recognize We need to work very hard to get the State back in 2028....step by step,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-04-01T21:46:33,172
"I'm not surprised by Florida. Of course you hope for better but I expected the outcome.   Wisconsin is a big deal. Elon  came in and tried to buy the election and as of now he seemed to fail. Florida is red, they stayed red. Wisconsin has been more of a swing and for Elon to fail in his attempts to use his power and money, which gives me hope.",Bookshelfhelp,2025-04-01T22:38:37,57
"For once, these are some massive dubs for the Dems. Fuck, it finally feels like we have a real opposition party coming together! Let's keep this momentum going!",Saturnboy13,2025-04-01T22:42:06,36

"Yes we technically lost in Florida (and winning it was long shot anyway), but dang we doubled our ‚Äò24 percentage, plus with the win in Wisconsin, what little hope I had left it starting to grow.   Also Cory Booker is amazing!",WeeklyExplorer9703,2025-04-02T00:11:49,23

"Yesterday was a desperately needed good day to be a Democrat:  * Cory Booker‚Äôs epic speech * Victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election * Surprisingly good performance in the Florida special elections, even though we lost  We have hope, and to quote *Kingdom Come*, one of my all-time favorite comic books, ‚ÄúIf any of us are to survive‚Ä¶ any if us‚Ä¶ now, more than ever‚Ä¶ we need hope!‚Äù^(1)  https://preview.redd.it/glhlnnf7wese1.jpeg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ada425df994d9d65a47a0835ed4d46b7150ac41  ^(1) Just to explain what‚Äôs going on in that scene, it‚Äôs set in a dark future of the DC Comics Universe. Superman quit years before, the superheroes lost their moral compass and started fighting each other without regard for human life. Basically, the world has gone to Hell. But in the next pages, a streak appears in the air and rescues people. Someone in the crowd yells, ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù, someone else shouts, ‚ÄúUp in the sky!‚Äù, and Superman is back.",Maryland_Bear,2025-04-02T07:09:43,2

Democrats always over perform in specials but it would have taken an outright miracle for Dems to pick up those seats.,Firesoldier987,2025-04-02T00:46:08,17
Republicans have been blatantly going after public lands protections in Florida and people are PISSED. One thing pretty much every Floridian agrees on is don't touch our environmental protected lands.,digitaldumpsterfire,2025-04-02T10:16:30,7
Cool but they still lost by 15 points. Let's not pretend like that this was close. Dem have loved these moral victories but more often than not they translated to later wins.,jonmon454,2025-04-02T08:45:32,2

"Yes, they were projecting to win by +30 and only won by 8%. That‚Äôs a monumental shift, either because voters are being swayed towards democrats including hardcore conservatives after just 2 months, or conservatives are complacent right now",Link__117,2025-04-01T22:09:36,405
"when people use the term ‚Äúover-perform‚Äù they often mean a few things: - candidates performed better than last election‚Äôs candidates - candidates performed better than turnout numbers suggested, getting a high number of ‚Äúcross-over‚Äù votes from opposite party affiliation  - candidates performed better than they were predicted to perform  In this case, the Florida candidates did all three, cutting districts Dems have lost by more than 30 points in the past by more than half.",Llama_Llama_Raccoon,2025-04-01T22:32:25,143
"It is an overperformance. If we can make a deep red state come within 10 points, there are no confirmed battleground states during the midterms anymore. The important thing is that we maintain this momentum.",Dirk_McGirken,2025-04-02T01:23:48,31

"Look, if every congressional district suddenly went 15 points to the Democrats, there's a good 60 seats that would flip.   Which is still a little disturbing that there's that many safe R's, and also these numbers are only getting worse for them.",lastres0rt,2025-04-03T15:01:31,1
