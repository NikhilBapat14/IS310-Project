r/politics is already calling on Dems to do this every day. Are they too stupid to realize that the only thing it’s gonna do is make them look bad? What a bunch of buffoons…,Wolf687,2025-04-28T16:47:27,189
Just seven? They're losing their touch,ev_forklift,2025-04-28T20:49:01,7
It is mentioned how DOGE and his treatment of the media are factors here. Hilarious! Is he supposed to expand and oversaturate the government like his predecessors? Allow Democrats money laundering? Allow the media to keep lying and manipulating the narrative?,AndForeverNow,2025-04-28T16:41:14,57

It's 100% partisanship lmao.  He is only introducing it because he is getting primaried from his left,MoisterOyster19,2025-04-28T17:17:43,10
Yet most republicans in the house and senate don’t get it. The left plays for keeps and will do what it takes to get power.  Republicans won’t even hold the corrupt and the criminals responsible. Jim Jordan will just hold another hearing.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-29T09:39:37,2

By morning? I didn’t even get an hour. I was banned until I sent a message to the mods explaining what I did wrong and why it won’t happen again. I said I didn’t break any rules. The mod said yes last chance. I then replied if you don’t know how do I know? Basically I told him he can kiss my ass.
