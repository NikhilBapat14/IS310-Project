"It would be nice if they could push back with a bit more frankness and honesty. They're still practicing that age-old decorum that has gotten us into this mess.

Trump has not done one good thing for people since he’s been elected president again.   Everything he does is devastating – not just the crippling of NPR.,thomport,2025-05-04T17:44:09,1

There are rural public radio from all parts of the US. While people cannot access NPR directly over the radio they have local public  radio station that purchase membership from NPR and BBC and broadcast pretty much the same material. These will be devastating to local station. Thou I am sure you can listen to NPR online though but people are lazy.,expendable117,2025-05-04T15:33:59,8
