American non-voters living life on hard mode. Let's give a crazy old man supreme executive power and then fight back...,neutrino71,2025-05-06T04:53:50,14
"Until there are ways to put him in prison, I don't think that would do much.  It's not like the current landscape can get him removed despite the unpopularity.",thieh,2025-05-06T04:47:11,21
"“Yet the nation’s response to politicised mass firings, deportations without due process and much else has seemed curiously quiet”  Followed by talking about an AOC/Bernie rally expecting 3,000 and pulling 23,000. We haven’t been quiet.",FVjake,2025-05-06T07:44:31,7
"Until the United States copies Australia and 25 other countries in the world that have compulsory voting, it leaves themselves open to have a convicted felon like the Orange Cheeto manipulate the voting and steal an election. America has to go back to the Canadian system of paper only ballots that are hand counted. Otherwise you'll have Donald Trump's re-elected with Elon Musk type crooks manipulating the system once again.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-06T05:07:45,18
"Honestly, the fightback never really stopped. People have been protesting, organizing, and voting against him since 2016. It just gets louder every election cycle.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-06T05:06:18,12

No Paywall. Good article from prospectmagazine.co.uk. Covers the aftermath quite well.,drop-bear-rescue,2025-05-06T05:26:56,1

"The only people being quiet is the mainstream media. ""No, we don't have anybody to send to these protests. We're too afraid we'll lose our right to be in the White House Press Pool.""",SameResolution4737,2025-05-06T10:42:43,6
"Canada and most European countries don’t have compulsory voting and manage to not be as far right and insane as the US. It’s also very hard to rig elections since there are so many precautions and recounts in place and so many local and state governments collect and pour through the data. If there were mass fraud, someone would find it.",StormOk7544,2025-05-06T07:13:55,6
"I mean, at least offer the free sausages. I feel like free brats get a real turnout boost in the Midwest at least",pile_of_fish,2025-05-06T07:28:58,3
"Being forced to vote is a contradiction. Voting is inherently an expression of consent, choosing whether, how, or if to participate in the political process. If you are coerced into voting, it’s no longer a voluntary act, which undermines the very principle it’s supposed to uphold: individual choice. Compulsory voting turns a right into an obligation, and a choice into a command, which defeats the moral purpose of the vote itself.",MsRavenBloodmoon,2025-05-06T05:26:58,-11
" But this election it didn’t and if they keep this up for a couple of months more, there won’t be a new election cycle.",wiggmaster666,2025-05-06T10:47:21,3

"In Georgia we have electronic voting that prints out a paper ballot you check & then feed into an optical reader that registers your vote. Election workers (at least in my town) are trained to make sure you are satisfied with each step. The optical reader deposits your paper ballot into a lockbox, which is kept to compare to electronic tallies, both in close elections & with random audits by the Secretary of State. (He is a Republican, perfectly at home with voter suppression laws, but balks at actual fraud. You may remember Trump begging him on a phone call in 2021 to ""find him some votes"" and Lindsey Graham trying to get him to invalidate perfectly legal mail ballots).  Edit: syntax",SameResolution4737,2025-05-06T10:38:13,2
"Combine mandatory voting with a ‘none of the above’ option and a ‘discount my vote’ option made mandatory on every ballot   Discounts go in the bin, none of the above is counted and if it wins a majority the race in question must be re-run with new candidates",Drolb,2025-05-06T05:34:35,10
"Compulsory  voting doesn't mean you can't vote for ""I don't care"", it just means you have to actually show up and mark ""I don't care"".",thrawtes,2025-05-06T05:57:45,8
Oh noooo not more access to voting,VirtualGrey,2025-05-06T06:05:57,5
Fine but I’ve matured and damn if I don’t wish my 7 yr old self did something lol.,healywylie,2025-05-06T10:11:02,1
"What is the point of having a ""discount my vote"" option?",MadamPardone,2025-05-06T06:34:32,1
People should have a right to express their formal wish to not be part of the system even if the system mandates their taking part by voting,Drolb,2025-05-06T06:50:19,3
