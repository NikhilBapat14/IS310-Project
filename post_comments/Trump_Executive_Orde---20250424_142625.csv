"> The EO's main target is the principle of disparate-impact liability, the idea that racism, sexism, or some other form of discrimination can occur without explicit intent.   Or more realistically, without the plaintiff *proving* explicit intent. Because unless your employer/lender/landlord/etc is stupid enough to put ""we are rejecting you because you're a woman"" in writing, that's extremely hard to prove. More often it's like ""they turned me down and wouldn't say why and then I noticed there were no other women in the building.""   (This sounds extreme but I work in workplace safety and I have been to some businesses where there were 30 men and 1 woman and she's the receptionist. I don't think there's much I can do because as a man who doesn't directly work for them, I don't exactly have standing.

Will continue to repeat that these EO’s were *prepared ahead of time* by the Heritage Foundation. Trump is a glorified rubber stamper. There are many more to come.   The real people behind this have planned meticulously for it for years and have worked behind the scenes to bring project 2025 Into the horrifying reality we’re living now.  Russell Vought spoke proudly of it in a hidden camera interview he was duped into doing before the election and then the media just kind of quietly forgot about it.  One of his aides also apparently told the reporter that these would be communicated through non-government channels to avoid FOIA.   https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/russ-vought-project-2025-trump-secret-recording-invs/index.html,Sadandboujee522,2025-04-24T23:42:40,39

I realize women have been oppressed and face autonomy issues everyday and I don’t want to take away from their struggles at all, but I’ve been thinking about the impacts on men’s autonomy as well. This, of course isn’t how Gilead in THMT operates and we live in a patriarchal society but here are my thoughts:  I just saw more research that male BC/IUD type things can be effective for up to two years in studies, and I wonder if they’ll ban further research on this and scrap it because they’re “concerned” about the birth rate. I also wonder when/if they’ll make vasectomies illegal and/or mandate that no insurance can cover the procedure. The same goes for women BC and procedures.

Minority women were the most consistent Dem voting bloc when they at least showed up, to their credit. They got what was at stake, but a lot of white men and women fell for every distraction tactic in the book, MAGA or otherwise. Always at the expense of the working class and their ability to be independent as the final goal.  We should have been walking together, all races and creeds, hand in hand, to stop this.

"[The church sold its own soul to the conservative devil in the 70s, after desegregated schools were shot down by SCOTUS of the era.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/)  Literally everything from the Reagan evolution onwards within Christianity has been a product of that Faustian contract. Many will of course point out the church's past historical sins, and those are all true, but the church culture that arose from the Reagan era was different from the more politically diverse versions that existed in earlier post WWII decades. Many denominations were not always so directly aligned with the segregationists and the Republicans as they later became. Arguably, the old churches were just bought out by the far right like any business buyout.  This is precisely where the Heritage Foundation has risen, and why they wrote project 2025 as a guideline for Trump, which he agreed to adopt even as he lied about it last year.  The one thing that may well save us is they don't entirely have enough power to put it in place wholesale, but that depends entirely on how seriously we take the risk over the course of these next weeks, months and 1.5 years. Trump does sincerely seem to be losing some popularity with these moves, but pressure within congress is still not yet strong enough, and online propaganda for younger generations is not yet adequately warning them of the real danger.  The incel-ization of young men in gen z especially is very troubling, as pretty much every male hobby is being infiltrated by these numbnuts to sell the stupid ""anti-woke"" talking points. This applies regardless of whether or not those men are literally single, because it's not about sex or money alone, but about tying their identity directly to an authoritarian dehumanizing view of everyone not exactly like them. It was a mix of both the young men and (white) women who flipped to Trump in 2024, and more importantly, the much larger margins who didn't vote at all, that got us in this position.",NumeralJoker,2025-04-26T15:19:10,1

"Yeah shit is going to hit the fan a lot more before.   Btw here's a better way to deal with the morons: https://www.reddit.com/r/goodnews/s/Dr9HwfTjDD  They are morons but you do have a common enemy, the oligarchy.",asdwarrior2,2025-04-24T23:38:16,4
"If my sister in law were to admit she was a part of the problem I would welcome her. So far that hasn't been the case. She is self-righteous, hate-filled, judgmental, you name it. I am not looking forward to the annual lakehouse vacation. But if she shows any regret, I will be kind. I have always been the peacekeeper. She takes and takes and takes. She can't just accept we agree on ONE issue, she has to forward me crazy right wing podcasts. I have told her multiple times I don't do podcasts. But she always says, ""you'll like this"". WTF?! WHY would I like a right-winger preaching hatred???",SatoriFound70,2025-04-24T23:48:46,2
