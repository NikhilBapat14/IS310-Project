Threatening to push the red button only makes him look more ridiculous.",DucCat900,2025-04-28T13:48:41,46
"We seriously need to quit interviewing him. Just isolate him. Don't repost his bullshit site's posts, don't interview him, don't publish or broadcast anything he says or does.   Do have press attend the briefings, when they're not banned from the premises, but only as a back-check to witness what was said, since the newest round of press corps members include many of the worst liars we've had to listen to.   But really... deplatform him. That'll do more to spin his world sideways than any protest.",YPVidaho,2025-04-28T13:43:28,56

And Temu shoppers flipping their sit when seeing tariffs effects? And at least one economic firm predicting a recession by June and empty shelves? 5.

Bring it honestly. I feel we are at this point where elections are no longer going to be free or fair. The ETA (Election Truth Alliance) has excellent data and interpretations of it and he should have lost. All the swing states.... yeah no sorry. So many voters votes were changed or not submitted. I fear civil discourse and eventually civil war will be the only thing to fix us. 30 something percent of the country is okay with a sexual predator and a huge man child being in charge. They will never change their base morals which sadly are racist and handmaid's tale ish so.... they need to either go... or change their minds. I love how they pick things to polarize people... and now here we are on reddit dismissing a lot of it and nothing changes people's minds.,Fluffito91,2025-04-28T14:51:31,13
