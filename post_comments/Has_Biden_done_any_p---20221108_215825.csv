"The Congress has had a Democratic majority, so there has not been any legislation Biden has wanted to veto.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-11-09T03:09:35,23
"It's very rare for a president the veto legislation coming out of a Congress wholly controlled by his own party. No, Biden hasn't vetoed anything because his allies have controlled Congress his entire presidency.",[deleted],2022-11-09T05:33:08,13
"If you're interested, the last pocket veto was exercised [by Clinton](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/vetoes/vetoCounts.htm) on December 19, 2000. So it's been a while since we've seen one!",KaesekopfNW,2022-11-09T12:37:11,3
"Nope, but you wouldn't expect him to do so when his party control both Houses of Congress anyway.",mormagils,2022-11-09T08:32:16,2
"Other than every single policy that Trump pushed through, even the ones that worked to a degree. Biden just threw them out the window.   Not saying this is bad or anything, but you generally wouldn't want to throw away policies and/or legislations that work.",[deleted],2022-11-14T23:57:47,1
That was executive orders not vetos,HiggetyFlough,2022-11-15T19:52:44,1
So you don't deny Biden throwing away the policies that worked? How sad.,[deleted],2022-11-16T06:39:21,1
"I'm correcting you on the veto point. Also I'm not sure which of the EOs were helpful besides maybe the insulin one, which health care centers claimed was actually making it more expensive for them to provide low cost insulin",HiggetyFlough,2022-11-16T08:41:42,1
