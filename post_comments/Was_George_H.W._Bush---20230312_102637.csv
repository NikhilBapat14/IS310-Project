"He was a pretty popular VP of a very popular president. I don't remember any ""personal unpolularity"" heading into that election but I was pretty young. The ""no new taxes"" pledge was what killed him in the 92 election.",TomGNYC,2023-03-13T10:34:06,5
He sat down with one of the network anchors (maybe Dan Rather) for an interview early on and waffles around the questions. Rather said something like I'm sitting here with George Bush. Is he ready to run? I think the answer is clearly no.  But Dukakis was a pretty unappealing candidate.  Bush would've beat Clinton if Perot hadn't split the vote (just like Gore would've won if Nader hadn't split the vote).,[deleted],2023-03-13T03:05:05,9
"The left wing media was crucifying him for being out of touch and elitist.  They went after his wife for her looks.  They went after him for raising taxes to fix the budget, which led to years of prosperity under Clinton, even though Democrats wanted him to raise taxes  It was terrible",true4blue,2023-03-13T08:17:12,1
">	served under an immensely popular incumbent  He had the same problem as Biden. Following someone so popular and charismatic leaves people expecting a 3rd energetic term and then not getting it. It’s anti-climactic, on top of promising no new taxes.",ElectronGuru,2023-03-13T01:51:55,0
"""Unpopularity"" is probably overselling it, but [43% of Americans still didn't have an opinion on Bush even as he entered office](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx). He took office with an approval rating of 51. That doesn't really sound that bad to us, because nowadays parties are so polarized that that's about where a president's approval rating tops out, haha. But it was odd for the '80s, when presidential approval ratings had a much broader normal range. For context, Bush's popularity topped out at 89 around the time the US won the Gulf War, and bottomed out at 29 during the 1992 re-election bid.",anneoftheisland,2023-03-16T10:44:39,1
"Bush famously said ""Read my lips! No new taxes!""  Then he raised taxes.   This may have something to do with it.",tnic73,2023-04-02T14:34:19,1
">  >  >  >  > Bush would've beat Clinton if Perot hadn't split the vote (just like Gore would've won if Nader hadn't split the vote).  This is a myth.  Perot actually split the vote from both Clinton and Bush voters, and at most, cost Bush only Ohio.",Naliamegod,2023-03-13T05:08:07,20
Gore did win.  Won the popular vote.  Won Florida when votes were actually counted. Just allowed the respect for the country to give the SCOTUS and a sibling of the candidate the power to call ab election.,ArcherChase,2023-03-13T08:54:44,4
"You are correct about the narrative of him being an out of touch patrician. The media really pushed that narrative. He didn't help himself much on that count, though, and I campaigned for the man. He famously went to a grocery store, had no idea how much a gallon of milk cost, and had never seen a barcode scanner before. To be fair, the man had been President or VP  for 12 years, and I'm guessing they dont do a lot of grocery shopping. He also had one of the worst debate performances in modern history, notably looking at his watch. This played into Clinton's empathy and common touch.   It was actually the right wing media that pushed the no new taxes story. Limbaugh, in particular, saw it as a grave betrayal and supported Buchanan in the 92 primary. Buchanan's showing in the primary led to Perot's entering the race.   He also faced the challenge of winning a fourth consecutive term for his party, which had only been done twice in the 20th century, both times involving guys named Roosevelt.",LittleJimmyMadison,2023-03-13T09:56:49,4

The mainstream media picked a side in that campaign.  They wanted Clinton to win.  They bashed Bush nonstop while downplaying the endless stories of Clinton’s womanizing and the whitewater issue,true4blue,2023-03-13T10:53:54,2
"This is factually incorrect.  If you have citations to back this, I'd be happy to review it but by all counting metrics, Gore won.  https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/index.html  https://theintercept.com/2018/11/10/democrats-should-remember-al-gore-won-florida-in-2000-but-lost-the-presidency-with-a-preemptive-surrender/  Gore didn't demand and fight for the proper recount.  He let the concept of national unity cloud his decision making and allowed the SCOTUS to end the recounts and hand Bush the Presidency.",ArcherChase,2023-03-14T13:42:45,0
"Are people in here just too young to remember the 2000 election?!?  You rely on Wikipedia instead of primary sources that are still readily available online.  As someone who loves through this event while teaching Government, I have a decent memory of the chain of events.   Gore conceded but he should not have done so. The SCOTUS stopped a legally mandated recount which several counties and districts were not following the required recount. There was an assault on one of the centers by Republican operatives (Brooks Brothers riot).  JEB was governor and pushing that state for his brother.",ArcherChase,2023-03-13T10:48:06,10

"I agree that by the fall of 92, the feeding frenzy on Bush was pretty apparent. Bush had received a massive rally around the flag effect during the Gulf War and was applauded on all sides. Bush seemed unbeatable. The story going into the Democratic primaries was all of the heavy hitter who decided not to run (Cuomo being the most noteworthy). Clinton's chief rival was Paul Tsongas, a former Sentor. As the economy declined, Bush's numbers declined as well.   Clinton's philandering was well known at that point. Most voters didn't really care. Heading into the convention there was a movement to replace Clinton because of the scandals, but he had the delegates.   Perot was a media creation. He launched his campaign on Larry King. His campaign, in many ways, foreshadowed Trump in 2016, a controversial outsider who brought good ratings and received lots of free media.  I don't buy the whole liberal media bias that conservatives have been pushing since at least Nixon. While reporters are often more liberal than the population at large, the media is ultimately businesses that respond to the profit motive. That is why Trump got all the free media in 2016. They pursue sales and rating above all else.",LittleJimmyMadison,2023-03-13T14:52:31,2

"The voters didn’t care about Clinton’s womanizing because it was never reported.  Look at how the media went insane with Stormy Daniels  and compare that the treatment Clinton’s accusers got.

"> Guess you missed the part that by every possible metric, when all votes were counted, Gore won.  I stated that, given the standards requested by either party, Bush won. The article confirms that statement is accurate.  You're attempting to make a completely different argument that if you get to pick one particular set of conditions with full knowledge after-the-fact you can invent a scenario where Gore would win. Of course, you can do the exact thing to conclude that Bush won. It's not a reasonable argument - there's a reason the courts reject your ""recount until you get the result you want"" approach to elections.  Note: You should also stop trying to make the ""but he won the popular vote!"" argument. It's the same as the drunk at the bar who insists his team ""got more yards!"" despite them losing the game. You're not making a reasonable argument so much as displaying blind partisanship.",ViskerRatio,2023-03-14T19:45:54,4
