But he wasn‚Äôt trying to dismantle the country. I acknowledge he is evil. I do. But each new iteration of GOP leadership is a magnitude of evil worse than the last one.,Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-03-30T09:47:08,18

"Cheney is absolutely shit. The idea that even he and much of the modern Republican party don't see eye to eye on what a 'reasonable' amount of exploitation of the country is is exactly what should be making everyone hesitate on how fucked u.s. politics is getting. It has somehow managed to go from 'these people will let others die to get rich' to 'these people will tank their own personal wealth if it means they can hurt other people they hate even more'.   It somehow went from 'only' greedy-selfish evil to vindictive-sociopath evil.¬†   Hell, with the greedy selfish evil thing they usually at least buried the leid and didn't outright brag to their supporters that their policies were probably going to harm their own constituents. Now they can deliberately tell their own voters how everyone needs to suffer to make sure the 'woke' group or whatever suffers more, and a huge amount of their morons eat it up.",triedpooponlysartred,2025-03-30T13:51:15,7

Cheney was evil and terrifying... I'm always shocked when people forget how bad those times were.,BloopityBlue,2025-03-30T09:18:01,14
Not whitewashing. I just think he was a greedy SOB who didn‚Äôt care about long term consequences. Trump is an incompetent greedy SOB who doesnt care about consequences.,Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-03-30T09:51:53,4

Yeah...that's it...at least.  Back to the Founding Fathers...I think that America's leaders have been mostly about America for OUR profit and not for someone else's across the ocean...  It has always been about those stupid Stamp Taxes and Tea Taxes...  But they sold Americans a bill of goods. 'Freedom' never meant equality to our elite class...it meant that we would all compete for who can control the most. There is always a winner and a loser when you allow competition without a mercy rule...and we go through cycles in which occasionally there is an adjustment back towards a more 'level playing field'.  The Civil War was our first adjustment.  The Great Depression and the New Deal was our second.  We are approaching our third...only this time we aren't facing slave owners or Robber Barons...we are facing our own 'leaders' and their idea that the rich should control everyone and use American resources to enrich mostly themselves.,Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-03-30T20:49:56,3

"No, I don‚Äôt think I am.  The phrase ‚Äúat least competent‚Äù is putting Cheney in a good light. If anything, I wish Cheney were at least 50% more incompetent than he was.  It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúat least Nazi‚Äôs were efficient.‚Äù Yeah, at murdering people. That‚Äôs not the ‚Äúleast‚Äù about them, it was the worst part about them. They murdered AND they did it with industrialized efficiency.",TonyzTone,2025-03-30T17:23:51,2
