"I'm not interested in all these stories.  We could see it.  I'm not interested in the revisionist history of pretending they weren't gaslighting us about it at the time.    I AM interested in knowing if any charges can be leveled at people close to the situation who were involved in this.    Only through accountability can we get closure and a precedence for anyone thinking about doing it in the future.    Here they are trying to monetize what they did, and in doing such has handed evidence to any applicable prosecution.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-06T10:37:51,12
