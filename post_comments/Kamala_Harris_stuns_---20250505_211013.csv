">In a statement to Vogue, Harris praised the work of the Costume Institute, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art more broadly, for giving trenchant, agenda-setting examples of creativity—such as the ones on display in “Superfine,” which positions the Black dandy as an icon of self-determination and resistance—a platform.  >“Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,” Harris said. “Artistic expression—whether it’s dance, music, visual arts, or fashion—has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.”  >Describing the concept behind Harris’s look, Kamara told Vogue that “for this monumental night at the Met celebrating Black culture and iconicity, we felt simplicity is best.  >https://www.vogue.com/article/kamala-harris-off-white-met-gala-2025",progress18,2025-05-05T21:20:36,58

"> Trump erred nonstop.   So did she. Trump being horrible doesn’t change anything about her.

She decided to move to the right of Biden even though Bidenomics was about being more progressive. That’s why their tax policies looks so different.  These were self-inflicted problems.
