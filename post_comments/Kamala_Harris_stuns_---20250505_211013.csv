">In a statement to Vogue, Harris praised the work of the Costume Institute, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art more broadly, for giving trenchant, agenda-setting examples of creativity‚Äîsuch as the ones on display in ‚ÄúSuperfine,‚Äù which positions the Black dandy as an icon of self-determination and resistance‚Äîa platform.  >‚ÄúArt has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúArtistic expression‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs dance, music, visual arts, or fashion‚Äîhas a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.‚Äù  >Describing the concept behind Harris‚Äôs look, Kamara told Vogue that ‚Äúfor this monumental night at the Met celebrating Black culture and iconicity, we felt simplicity is best.  >https://www.vogue.com/article/kamala-harris-off-white-met-gala-2025",progress18,2025-05-05T21:20:36,58
