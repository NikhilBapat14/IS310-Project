"Legally perhaps not, but ethically absofuckinglutly. But then again, politicians are now campaigning openly on ethically dubious stances that would have shuttered the doors 15 years ago.",Ezzmon,2024-08-23T11:43:35,18
"I don't think so. I don't think it's any different than the primaries, where let's say Nikki Haley sees that she can't win so she drops out and endorses Trump.   If the quid pro quo is illegal, then they simply won't put it in writing. RFK endorses Trump, RFK gets a cabinet position, both of which are totally legal.   However, if I were an RFK supporter, I would have to give his endorsement very little weight when it seems like the endorsement is simply going to the highest bidder.",waterbuffalo750,2024-08-23T12:41:22,4
There is a law that bans a Presidential candidate offering someone a future position during the campaign. I cannot find it though.,seanosul,2024-08-23T16:43:59,3
"I think its illegal to straight up say ""Drop out and I will give you X"". But in effect this happens all the times.  Cabinet positions and other rewards of power are absolutely a method that candidates use to influence others decisions.  Will anyone be prosecuted? No.  After what I have seen the past 8 years, even if there was concrete evidence of this happening I doubt it would have any meaningful legislation.",deten,2024-08-23T17:36:12,3
"This is NOT a dig at the brain worm in his head but it is more likely that he is dropping out because he was getting near zero support and wouldnt have even been on the ballot in most states. Add to that the fact that he has hit up BOTH campaigns to ask for a job in their future administrations (and been turned down  by both), there are good odds NOBODY paid him anything for any reason and he is just making up fibs to cover up being a total loser.",tuna_tofu,2024-08-23T16:50:17,2
"To the best of my knowledge, that wouldn't fall under bribery and definitely not election interference.  Election interference typically applies to the actions of foreign entities or other countries.  Bribery is a trickier issue. But wouldn't qualify technically or legally as a bribe.  Bribery and corruption itself is a tricky issue because, as with most concepts in society, a lot of people don't understand it or have a proper logical concept of it, including respected authorities, and that misunderstanding can find its way into our laws and institutions.  Properly or logically, bribery shouldn't even be a crime (yes).  Corruption is the crime.  But because people don't understand this, they make bribery a crime. Now bribery itself is a very lose concept, so many things can qualify as a bribe, and a bribe can apply in so many contexts good and bad, harmless or harmful; that means we create a very large grey area in our laws and it's application, by failing to understand these concepts and applying them in law.  Ps: with the move you have described, that's just part of politics. It's done and even encouraged all the time; playing teams in that manner to one's advantage.",fletcher-g,2024-08-23T11:43:33,2
"RFK explicitly asked for Health Secretary, during a recorded conversation. 18 U.S. Code § 599 prohibits this specific type of quid pro quo",pfchp,2024-08-25T10:15:21,1
Short answer yes. Long answer also yes.  Gotta stack the deck with the guy who claims to have had a brain worm.,zeppolizeus,2024-08-26T07:40:24,1
"You are 100% right! If we're being honest, has Trump ever been held accountable for his actions or behaviors? I had a suspicion that RFK Jr. was going to do something odd. By chance, did you see the interview he gave with Fox News talking about how upset his family and wife are because he endorsed Trump? I won't be surprised if Trump fires Vance and Kennedy takes that spot. I liked Kennedy at the beginning, but then when I heard him talk about staging that dead bear in Central Park to make it look like it got hit by a bicyclist and how he thought it was funny because they were looking for who did it for such a long time and then he just admitted it not too long ago. Then when he was talking about worms in his head. Now I feel like the more he speaks the more he sounds like a MAGA supporter.  I've been a Republican my whole life, but I cannot support Donald.",[deleted],2024-08-26T09:35:18,1
"Was always kind of interested in RFK, now I think he's just trash and Trump's a good fit for that.  If you look at his platform, Trump and Republicans are definitely not aligned with any of that other than vaccine mandates.  Quite honestly having him possibly in charge of national health is scary as hell.  Pretty easy add for Dems to start running.  Kill your children, vote for Trump and RFK.  He'll be a good fit for Trump's base, but be a real turn off for moderates.",bjdevar25,2024-08-23T13:15:28,0
The ultimate drop out for a promised gain - Biden dropping out for Harris!!!!!!  So that Pelosi and crew wouldn’t expose his corruption or use the 25th amendment against him!!!!!!!! As usual - It ok for one side to do it but not the other - rules for thee the but not for me!!!!!,Psychological-Ball77,2024-08-25T09:23:35,0
"You may be right that’s there are at least some ethical or moral concerns, but not that this only starting happening in the last 15 years…",redtailedhawkish,2024-08-23T17:43:34,2
"> Legally perhaps not, but ethically absofuckinglutly.    I completely disagree.  The purpose of a candidate is to have their policy position implemented in a government.  People aren't obligated to vote for that candidate, but if another candidate promises them a spot in their government, then their voters can decide for themselves if that would improve their opinion on that candidate.",solid_reign,2024-08-23T17:11:50,2
"I don’t see why.  He’s not gonna win.  He knows it.  He’s gonna need a job.  Guy offers him a job.  He has no moral obligation to run, no moral obligation to persist past the point of reality.  No moral obligation to not work for someone elses campaign.",SpiceyMugwumpMomma,2024-08-23T22:56:50,1
I also question how he said he wasn't dropping out he was just suspending himself. So does that mean that he still gets to collect money for endorsements? At least after Nikki Haley dropped out and endorsed him she then went on to say a few things that wasn't in Trump's favor. I think the people are starting to understand that you can still be a republican but not support Donald,[deleted],2024-08-26T09:42:20,1
"It got worse after Citizens United for sure, which opened previously illegal ways for candidates to raise absurd cash. Now, cash decides elections, not ethics, and in my humble opinion, this makes representation a secondary priority for candidates",Ezzmon,2024-08-23T17:49:16,3

"Oh no doubt. Nikki Haley must have gotten a sweet deal out of her endorsement of Trump, she flipped like an olympic judoka. Without, seemingly, changing any aspect of Trumps policy as the caveat. Which begs the question; was her campaign disingenuous, or would her representation in Trump’s administration be?",Ezzmon,2024-08-23T18:15:08,2
