"Mr. President and his U.S. team and secret service. My father Martin J Armstrong of Melbourne, Australia is a former CIA assassin and serial killing pedophile and abused and tortured me as a child to the point I repressed all my memories. I now at adult age remember my past and remember him and some of his killer pedophile friends and that they buried many bodies of children after rape and torture (which I know as sometimes included myself), at the famous Toorak mansion of Crownlana in Melbourne Australia and others at my family farm called Riverbank in country Victoria, Australia whilst he was a CIA operative. The world must know the truth that extends beyond this story and what it is to be the CIA.  The manager of that farm Tony Knight is also Australian based CIA and a killer pedophile. I’ve been forced to bury a body as a child by him and my dad I just had it all repressed as they really tortured me so very badly (I was electrocuted during a gang rape at this farm for example!!!!) Now my memory has returned I’m scared of how to deal with this as there were many high profile men involved and my father was CIA….   Mr. President you are one of the few outside the CIA to have the ability to know this is true. My family all have the guise of a normal happy family but my father is not what he seems at all and he controls everything. I’m now meant to be on holiday OS in Thailand but have terrible repressed memory coming back…. I’m now calling the hotel doctor… Please whomever on the Presidents team reads this needs to acknowledge it to be a true crime report and send the secret service to me to get me into safe custody. My name is Toby John Pierce Armstrong. I stand behind the truth of this initial disclosure. I need the secret service onside as I’m so very afraid for my life knowing that the CIA have supported my father and his serial killer friends. Please can the public support me by posting this on as much as possible and raising awareness and getting the authorities all onto it all over the world!!!!!",BiggestWhistleblower,2025-04-26T07:55:13,-1

"Someone can think he's focusing on the wrong priorities and still overall approve. But people get way too caught up in sample size when it's way less important than people think. What actually matters is methodology and getting a representative sample, if you can do that a sample size of 100 is actually, believe it or not, just as good for a 10,000 people group as it is for a 10 million people one. Of course, getting a representative sample from a larger population might necessitate a larger sample size to fully capture the diversity of the population (if there's a group that only makes up 1/10000 people, a 1000 sample size is likely to not include them at all for example). It's like a soup, if it's well mixed a spoonful will be enough to tell if it's seasoned properly no matter how large the pot is.",Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-26T08:48:10,6

I’m wondering what excuses republicans will make to force their way in reddit. They are obsessed with Wikipedia for critizing them. I had seen red states local media reduced to listing nothing but positive reviews on outgoing republicans governors.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-26T08:28:13,10

"So long as Reddit isn’t something rural people and your uncle use it won’t be a priority for them.   They target “stuff people have heard of.”   They’re also lax to focus here because this is a website organized around lengthy text, which their target demographics abhor.
