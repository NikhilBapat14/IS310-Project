"Said another (accurate) way with more context:  [Army continues 7-year streak, hitting retention goals early](https://www.yahoo.com/news/army-continues-7-streak-hitting-144344397.html)  This is great news. It’s also not evidence, alone, of a new occurrence caused by recent policy changes.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-26T12:31:52,324

But but but I was reliably told by flaired users on this board that everyone hates Hegseth and he would ruin the military!,Texas103,2025-04-26T14:51:13,-9
Hmmmm? What has changed? Oh yea....'Orange Man Bad' is in the White House and has obviously inspired young people to join.  Edit: Don't understand the down votes. My reference to Trump was a sarcastic referral to leftists suffering from TDS. No one on Reddit seems to be able to grasp sarcasm.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-26T11:30:49,-49
Evidence of a crappy job market more than anything,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-26T13:48:06,309
And they lowered their goals last year.  From the cited article… “The service also met its lowered recruiting goals for the first time in two years in September. It is 85% of the way to its recruiting mission for this year with more than five months to go.”,boundpleasure,2025-04-26T18:25:28,32
"In what world do you think that is more accurate? The headline implies there's a 7 year streak of hitting the goals early like this but that's not true at all. There's a steak of hitting their targets, not doing so six months early... and in prior years they lowered the targets... so yeah they ""met"" the lowered targets...  You basically linked a propaganda piece that tries to spin this seven ways from sunday and then called it more accurate.",day25,2025-04-27T00:18:27,19
"Indeed. Still, I like that we are focusing the military in its core mission of ‘be capable of breaking things and killing people to protect America’",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-27T10:51:13,1

Army has met retention numbers for the past seven years,MCRNRocinante,2025-04-26T12:32:28,69
"These are retention numbers, not enlistment numbers. On that point though, they are likely to succeed where they previously have failed:  [2025 goal is 61,000 and as of April they’re at almost 52,000](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/04/21/army-recruiting-upswing-service-hits-85-of-annual-goal-5-months-left.html) - and summer is a big enlistment period.   Also worth noting that this goal was an increase over 2024, a year in which they also hit their goal after failing to do so in years prior.  Edit to add: don’t forget we’re talking about fiscal years here, so April is actually more than halfway through the evaluated time period.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-26T12:43:25,41
"Again, alone it’s not likely evidence of anything. There hasn’t been a crappy job market for all of the last seven years.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-26T14:09:36,-41
"1. It’s an Army Times piece. Sure, any source is gonna have bias; are you actually suggesting Army Times is propaganda that seeks to minimize the accomplishments of… the Army?  2. The initial headline (Not The Bee), nor the article  mention anything about the goal being hit in the last seven years.  3. I don’t say “more accurate.” I said “accurate” and with “more context.” The Army Times article provides greater context and is also accurate. I did not suggest one piece was more accurate than the other.   4. Both the headline of the Army Times article and the opening paragraph directly address your complaint. The headline uses a comma, separating the statement about continue the streak from the added context that it was hit early. The opening paragraph again addresses this, with a full sentence:  “this time, the accomplishment comes nearly six months ahead of schedule.”  Finally, to the point of lowering targets. Yes, in the past two years they lowered their targets and this current fiscal year was also “lowered” similarly, until they increased it by a few thousand in December. Although in larger context, the lowered number of 55,000 for 2024 is actually higher than the number was in 2020 - 50,200. Goals are being raised and lowered all the time and there are likely a number of reasons for this. At the moment we are not engaged in an active, large scale deployment like Iraq and Afghanistan were, to cite just one likely reason.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-27T04:26:20,5
"My interpretation would be that it's a rebound effect after the hit that recruitment took following the 2nd Iraq war.  It's no surprise that an unpopular war justified by fabricated claims would harm recruitment for years to come. I was saying this before we even went to war and few people were listening to me back then. I was reading the stuff coming out of the [PNAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century) (a now-defunct neocon thinktank) so it was no surprise to me when GWB pushed us into that war using 9/11 as an excuse, with no regard to the long-term negative consequences. And the hit to recruitment was one among many of those negative consequences.  I wish people could study the history of this stuff and learn from it. Yeah, people rejected GWB but a lot of people didn't really understand how we got into that mess to begin with, the forces behind it. I wish people had been held accountable and more than that I wish people, including both the Republican base and Republican leadership, learned from their mistakes.  Instead of actually understanding this history, the Republican party has been all ""hurr hurr, isolationism!"" in a shallow, often kinda knee-jerk way, while Democrats have, bizarrely, welcomed some of the tenets of neocon ideology under their tent, like they've taken the hawkish/interventionist foreign policy and paired it with their social and fiscal stances. And I'm just sitting here frustrated that no one is really having the tough conversations about what went wrong during that period of US history and what we can do to prevent it again.  And it goes back farther too, like a similar thing played out with Vietnam, not exactly the same but there are some parallels.",cazort2,2025-04-26T14:21:00,34
