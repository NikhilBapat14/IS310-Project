"Trump is inventing emergencies in an attempt to justify authoritarian rule.  He does not want to send troops to Canada.  He wants to send troops to California and Connecticut.  Trump wants to claim that there are threats at the border so that he justify deployments on the US side of the border.  He is already doing this along the Texas-Mexico border, and you can bet that he wants to go much further inland than that.",I405CA,2025-05-04T12:51:51,5

"I've got to wonder what the European Union thinks in all this. Squeezed between two dying super powers that are throwing tantrums daily, dealing with an immigration crisis, energy crisis, trade crisis, the rise of authoritarianism across the globe, what are their plans?   I understand that they're strengthening their trade ties with the UK, Canada, Mexico, China, and others. I also would expect them to sizeably grow their military spending and preparedness outside of NATO, but realistically what other plans are being laid? I feel that Van Der Layen and the EU as a whole are playing their cards very close to their chest right now.",FuzzyCub20,2025-05-04T15:28:42,1
"This is one of those issues where it's hard to know for sure if Trump is just vomiting words without thinking about them, or if he's being serious.  If it's the latter, and if he does intend to use military force to acquire Greenland, it will be a massive blow to his presidency and party.  The GOP Congress may be spineless when it comes to a lot of his actions, but this would effectively collapse NATO and potentially trigger a larger war.  That is very different from caving to Trump's cabinet picks.  So I don't see Congress going along with it; there is already some pushback against his budget and some of his other foreign policy decisions.  And, however illegitimate W. Bush's Iraq invasion was, he at least had to present Congress with a casus belli in the form of supposed WMDs.  It was a lie, of course, but it was seen at the time as a casus belli.  There is absolutely zero justification for an annexation of Greenland.  Then there's the American public and voters.  Not only is there no public support for an invasion of Greenland, but it's likely the fallout from such an annexation would be a crippling blow to the GOP in 2026 and 2028 because of the consequences of significant international backlash.    And at the end of the day, what will Trump have gained?  Access to Greenland's minerals and resources?  Not if military action is involved; any US exploitation of Greenland's resources would require cooperation from a wide variety of folks, from Greenlanders themselves to international corporations and consortiums.  If Greenland becomes a contested environment, it would be years before any kind of economic benefit could be seriously considered.  This is as self-defeating as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.  Of course, with Trump as with Xi, that doesn't mean it isn't possible; it just means it's very unlikely.",AcrobaticEdge5907,2025-05-04T15:33:01,1

It's the arctic we're worried about and this was a problem pre Trump 2. Like the part of Canada near Greenland which is undefended and is the entrance to the Northwest Passage which is becoming a viable sea lane because of climate change.

You’re not Canadian. Not sure how “electing the leader we think is most likely to be able to leverage existing ties to other economies and members of NATO” is “no definitive action”. There have also been military equipment acquisitions but we know US media doesn’t report on that. There is also a massive military recruitment campaign underway.
