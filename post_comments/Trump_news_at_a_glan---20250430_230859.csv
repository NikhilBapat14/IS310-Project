"At the risk of being overly-optimistic, after reading the article I'm reasonably confident Ukraine was able to spin this into a win.   They proposed the initial deal and the Trump team tried to egregiously alter the terms against Ukraine's interest, but it seems Ukraine's been able to renegotiate and has a positive outlook on the agreement. They keep ownership of their resources and organizations, make decisions on what to extract from where and when, and maintain all revenue from existing projects prior to the deal.   I think what the Trump team tried to do was reprehensible and won't forgive them for it, but this version of the deal could genuinely work out to Ukraine's economic and geopolitical advantage. Kudos to their negotiators and advisors for apparently pulling a rabbit out of a hat.",interwebz_2021,2025-05-01T00:34:39,7

They should have made the deal terminate if trump withdrawls support even in a comment on social media that he never followed through on.,the_simurgh,2025-05-01T01:30:35,2

"The Noem deportation threat just further confirms what we've already known; namely that these people view themselves as the ultimate authorities on who gets rights and who doesn't, and that they believe a subset of people have no legitimate right to genuine due process.  I'm cautiously (and maybe foolishly) optimistic that the courts will closely attend to the parties returned to the US from the Salvadoran prison and will oversee legitimate due process to determine whether deportation is truly warranted and to where.",interwebz_2021,2025-05-01T01:07:29,3
