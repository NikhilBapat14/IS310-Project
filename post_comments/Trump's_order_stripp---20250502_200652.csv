so judges now decide who gets security clearance?  seems odd,ABlackEye,2025-05-02T20:50:31,184
"The executive is the OCA, judges do not have this authority at all. I'd be shocked if this judge even has a clearance. This order should be ignored completely.",Doomie019,2025-05-02T20:54:18,50
"Pretty sure POTUS is the final say so if someone has a clearance or not... I mean, the agencies that issue said clearances report to and work for him. So the judge really has no ground to stand on...",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-02T20:49:00,42

"> A federal judge on Friday blocked a White House executive order targeting an elite law firm, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump’s campaign of retribution against the legal profession. U.S. District Beryl Howell said the executive order against the law firm of Perkins Coie violated multiple provisions of the Constitution and ordered that it be immediately nullified.

"The issue is Trump forcing companies like Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to provide half a billion dollars in pro bono work for initiatives backed by the Trump in exchange for them keeping their clearance.   Perkins Coie LLP and Fusion GPS refused to do it, and they lost their clearance over i. Trump is using the his presidential powers to do a shakedown.

"I don’t think they should take this to the Supreme Court because they’d probably lose. It’s clearly retaliation.  Instead they should actually use legitimate reasons to revoke the clearances.  For example, actually prosecuting people responsible for the Steele Dossier and then use that as the basis to revoke clearance.  Also Perkins Couie said Trumps action could bankrupt the firm, but I’m not sure winning this case will help much. Clients chose the firm in part for their political connections and now they are publicly on Trumps shit list.  I think this alone would be very bad for business.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-05-03T07:42:06,31

Retaliation?  How can you trust an organization with security clearance when they’re already been shown to have assisted in setting up the president in sham allegations by pushing a completely falsified dossier that was built on a paid spy who’s been convicted for falsehoods?

"That’s quite powerfully black & white language - do you have a source for that? I’d be very interested in seeing a ruling, piece of legislation, or section of the Constitution which states clearly what the judicial branch is supposed to “check.”  In this case, and only for this instance, the judge is citing [precedent from 1993](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/983/286/466819/):  “Importantly, the Lee decision did not disturb prior D.C.

"Yes, but if your boss transferred in from another department that had bad blood with yours and then decided to demote everyone in your department, everyone would sue and they’d win.
