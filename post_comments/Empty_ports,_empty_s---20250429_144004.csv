"It is too late. I am in shipping. Our core business is leasing the containers one way from China to the US and the selling the containers in the US in the wholesale market. Shipping has crashed and even if he changes his mind the damage is done. It will take at least a year to recover and prices will soar. Similar to Covid era. I could go into so much detail. But think of it this way. Most shipments are 45-90 days out. So, the disruption has already happened. We just have not “seen” it yet as we are still in the 45-90 day period and those good/containers are still coming in. After that… well… yeah. Nothing. You cannot just undo the issue. Some 80 cargo ships are shored up do to lack of cargo, they don’t just start shipping tomorrow if the tariffs go away. There is a lot of hurt coming. Unemployment is going up… very soon.",milaron01,2025-04-30T00:52:19,7

"A trade embargo against one of our largest trading partners, which disproportionately manufactures many of the consumer goods the public buys, without even a whiff of a concept of a plan as to how those goods will be sourced if domestic manufacturing can't be stood up in a matter of months (almost impossible in all cases).

"I believe it, I feel like we're constantly being gaslit by the media.  The gaslighting that's really hitting me right now though is the markets;  we've been trending upwards for a little while now and it's hard to believe that investors have a positive outlook right now.  They seem to be acting on 'insider knowledge' that Trump wants to do the tariffs(I read that the Walmart/Target cohort that met with him last week left looking significantly less stressed than when they entered, and the broader market seems to be reacting to this), but that seems to completely ignore the damage that has already been done that we haven't felt yet.   Once consumers feel the pain from that damage, consumer sentiment will drop hard and your average American will start to cut spending even more.  But the market seems to think people will still buy $2k iPhones and Teslas!  Seriously feeling gaslit as the S&P 500 is back up 10% since it's liberation day low.",drwhoovian,2025-04-29T15:13:27,9

">but they can sell to the rest of the world...       This is the exact problem for Trump's trade war.  Yes it hurts the economies of other nations but because he has gone to trade war with pretty much every trade partner in the world, it incentivizes those nations to have trade agreements that exclude the US to ease their economic impact.  In turn this puts the economic pain of every trade war he is fighting disproportionately on America, and risks them being on the outside after countries replace trade elsewhere.      It doesn't help for him either that China does not have any concern of risk over being voted out of power.",OriginalGhostCookie,2025-04-29T19:39:40,6
