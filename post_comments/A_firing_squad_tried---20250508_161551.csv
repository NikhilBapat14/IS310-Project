God damn. Though interestingly enough a heart shot I believe is more lethal than a headshot. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-08T16:35:46,4

"""A South Carolina man executed last month by firing squad may have suffered for an extended period of time before dying because shooters largely missed his heart, an autopsy commissioned by the state shows.  Mikal Mahdi died on April 11 after being shot by a three-person firing squad. But an autopsy revealed two wounds on his chest, not three. None of the bullets hit his heart directly, as is supposed to happen during the execution. Instead, the wounds caused damage to his liver and other internal organs, and allowed his heart to keep beating. Pathologists say the injuries likely caused the prisoner pain and suffering while he was still conscious.  Sponsor Message  ""He's not going to die instantaneously from this,"" said Dr. Carl Wigren, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy documents for NPR. ""I think that it took him some time to bleed out.""  On May 8, lawyers for Mahdi notified the South Carolina Supreme Court that the execution was ""botched."" They cited the state's autopsy and a forensic report that Mahdi's lawyers commissioned from another pathologist, Dr. Jonathan Arden.""",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-08T17:22:01,2

"Wanted: Executioner for firing squad. No experience is necessary. Free on the job training, free lunch, and 2 bathroom breaks.  I thought firing squads had all blanks except for one with the actual bullet so nobody actuay knows who killed him",JaVelin-X-,2025-05-08T17:06:36,1
I can’t imagine what type of person you would have to be to be on a firing squad. I would spend every waking moment of my day contemplating that moment. I have done and seen things far far far less consequential and still think about them to an unhealthy extent. ,PrestigiousRefuse172,2025-05-08T17:25:13,1
