">“People spend their whole careers [in the civil rights division] doing one particular kind of litigation, suing the police, suing the police, suing some more, suing employers, and it’s their part of it is a personal passion — well, this isn’t the personal passion department.”  It's honestly... infuriating. The sheer audacity to treat civil rights like some kind of optional extra, a hobby to be sidelined when it inconveniences those in power... it's just beyond comprehension. And the casual dismissal, “this isn't the personal passion department”, shows how little regard they have for the very people who deserve protection! The beneficiaries of this shocking shift are those who want to silence dissent and maintain control, and it's such a betrayal of our nation's values. I can't shake this feeling that it's all part of a larger plan... a plan that allows them to get away with it. Really unacceptable.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T13:08:53,12
"Republicans know that they are ever more unlikely to ever win another fair election... in elections without gerrymandering, voter suppression, and post election rule changes, Republicans will increasingly lose. You damn well better understand that, in all future elections moving forward, the only strategies they will have is to target and eliminate votes that they do not want to count; by limiting voting access, by making voting more onerous, by gerrymandering in their favor, by tossing out legitimate votes that they simply do not like, by judge shopping for election challenges, by endlessly appealing court verifications their clear losses, by attempting to take over State Election Boards for the sake of partisan influence... and on, and on, and on.  This latest attack on the Voting Rights Unit in the USDOJ is some late groundwork to pave the way for the corruption of the coming elections they will no doubt lose - the ones where the votes are counted completely and fairly. They've already purged the watchdogs from most of the nation's democratic (little D) institutions, they've already gutted the Voting Rights Act, they've already released all the criminals who participated in the 2020 putsch - for the coming attempt, they've quashed the most important investigations of our convicted felon president and most troublingly, persuaded a corrupt SCOTUS to suborn criminal behavior by that very same felon.  I hope this isn't seen by you as a TL;DR comment... if it is too long to spark an interest in possibly saving this grand democratic experiment, then I think you probably won't be able to.",phosdick,2025-04-28T14:47:19,4
