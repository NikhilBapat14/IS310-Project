"According to the article, “in a startling sign, the Trump Organization has started selling Trump 2028 Hats.” Why is this startling? Only people who haven’t been paying attention would be shocked. They openly been talking about this stuff for months.",Whitey-Willoughby,2025-04-28T11:08:09,27
He is learning very well from Putin and soon turning into a puppet of Putin. Everything he is doing is pointing towards this.,Merchant1010,2025-04-28T11:05:22,24
Trump has said never jokes.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-28T11:12:07,10
calling it a joke is belittling the situation.,shadowdra126,2025-04-28T11:56:17,9
"Trump can’t serve as Vice President in any administration. One of the few requirements for Vice President is that they have to be eligible to be President, just like a 21 year old cannot be Vice President. Trump isn’t eligible.",Huckleberry199,2025-04-28T16:56:03,3

"Seeing as is accusing news polls as election interference,  seems he is not joking.",KidKilobyte,2025-04-28T11:25:37,2
He's not fucking joking! He's selling 2028 merch!,KinkyPaddling,2025-04-28T12:41:07,2
"Remember when he made a ""joke"" about Canada being the 51st state?",Hazer_123,2025-04-28T12:54:23,2
"Someone from the Trump family runs as President and VP. Say Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump becomes Speaker of the House, which is not specified as a member of Congress. Don Jr. and Eric step down, Trump becomes President for a third term as the 22nd Amendment only prohibits running for President, not serving as President. The office becomes the family business. Don't put this past them.  Trump 2028.  The hat doesn't say it has to be dad.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-28T20:00:49,2
">Donald Trump can’t help speculating about serving a third term as president—even as he claims, “It’s not something that I’m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do.”  >The president made the comments to [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/06/trump-second-term-comeback/682573/) in a new interview published Monday, laughing about the idea. He said, “That would be a big shattering, wouldn’t it? Well, maybe I’m just trying to shatter.”  Notice that none of these comments are ""I'm not allowed to do that because of the Constitution."" Even when he says ""It's not something that I'm looking to do,"" that's not the same as saying he's not *allowed* to do it.  This part sums it up well:  >As with any half-baked or outrageous Trump statement, it’s only far-fetched until Trump tries to put it into action. The question is how strong resistance would be if and when the time comes.",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T12:08:07,1
"Oh, I'm so writing in Obama's name if this becomes reality.",dispelhope,2025-04-28T12:41:42,1
He didn’t want to give up his first term so why do people think he is going to stop on his second term?,Ryslan95,2025-04-28T13:03:19,1
These are not jokes they are telegraphs,Alaskanzen,2025-04-28T13:35:02,1
If SCOTUS was actually worth anything they should declare load and clear this isn't legally possible.   Then again the rule of law is dead.,Festering-Fecal,2025-04-28T14:28:41,1
Take this very seriously,MarinatedPickachu,2025-04-28T15:15:13,1
"For anyone panicking. Trump would have to get Congress and 38 states to pass a constitutional amendment changing the two-term limit. And he only got 31/50 states for the election. He won’t get 38. In total, there are 7,386 state legislators across the United States. To amend the Constitution, a proposed amendment must be ratified by 38 out of 50 state legislatures. Without that, it’s 100% impossible for him to officially serve a third term. He’s using this opportunity to make money from his fans that buy his merch.",jaserx91,2025-04-28T19:56:49,1
And he’s getting ready to use the military on the US soil to help.,NapOwl,2025-04-28T21:00:01,1
Sincerely -- the only shocking part of this to me is that they didn't have them out for sale already.,BurnedWitch88,2025-04-28T11:27:16,8
"Even of h wasn't planning to run again, he'd still be selling 2028 merch just because he'd never pass up the chance to cash in on his gullible base.",Frigguggi,2025-04-28T11:42:30,5
Hopefully sensationalist headlines will break through to the MAGA cultists.,masterchefguy,2025-04-28T11:28:57,3
King Krasnov has been a Putin Puppet since before the first administration run.,masterchefguy,2025-04-28T11:27:59,7
"Yeah, I don’t know. Right now I’m taking it about as serious as the 51st state shit. It’s obnoxious and harmful rhetoric, but nothing more. When they start trying to change the constitution or make moves toward some other work around I’ll start to worry. In the meantime, I’m more concerned about what the DNC has planned for the midterms and 2028.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-28T11:15:27,3
"He just never shuts up. Most of the things he says turn out to be lies, errors, and wishful thinking, and some come true.",DentedAnvil,2025-04-28T11:18:25,8
He is normalising it.,SpiritedEclair,2025-04-28T12:03:41,3
DNC prep must be going hard. I believe the US politics is in total chaos right now. Hoping big mistakes that cannot be solved are not made during the term.,Merchant1010,2025-04-28T11:21:58,5
"Every ridiculous thing he’s said he’s done. He is not kidding one bit. Stop thinking reasonably. Always, with these people, assume the worst and believe what they say…he’s a fascist, he has no intention of giving up power and risk dying in a prison cell.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T12:24:30,5

He means everything he says. The fact they are lies or wishful thinking doesn’t matter…he means everything he says.,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T12:26:35,2
"Has he? Such as?  People like to point out that he’s only been able to accomplish anything through executive order, but then they also believe he’ll get Congress to change the constitution. They like to point out his foreign policy is a joke and he hasn’t accomplished a single thing he’s set out to do, but then also believe he’s going to annex a whole ass country?  I think talk like this just big ups him. While I agree it is a mistake to underestimate the damage a moron is capable of, that doesn’t mean there is any reason to pretend like that moron is some kind of evil genius. Trump is not nearly that smart, and he’s surrounded by incompetent sycophants.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-28T14:43:13,2
Sure. In so much as they ever really are.,HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-28T14:44:14,2
"See this is the problem, just because he’s signing the orders doesn’t mean he’s the one really in charge. First of all, he’s a Russian asset, so Putin is calling most of the shots. The rest are being handed to him by conservative think tanks like the heritage foundation and the rest of the architects of project 2025. He’s just a dumb ass bullhorn mouthpiece, that’s front and center as a distraction, while the real power works behind the scenes to completely dismantle every aspect of our government. He’s just repeating orders from his two overlords, they mean it and so does he.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T14:56:59,1
