Why? What purpose does this serve? I swear he latches on to the dumbest shit.  This is NOT an issue that anybody cares about.,ShillinTheVillain,2025-04-15T22:21:54,1205
This would start a dangerous precedent I am not onboard with this at all. What happens when President AOC is in office.  All those right wing white domestic terrorist could be next. I don’t know what exactly that means. Joe Biden used that phrase constantly or a reasonable facsimile of that. The Biden admin said that was the most dangerous threat to the country.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-16T10:00:17,223

"It saves on money to outsource our most dangerous criminals to El Salvador. We can even pay for American watchdogs to ensure the rights of our prisoners are being upheld, and it would still be much cheaper than keeping them interned here.  It's called comparative advantage-- very well-established economic principle! They don't have the same infrastructure we do, so it's better economically if we have Salvadorans work jobs like ""prison guard."" It would be a huge boon for both of our economies.  Plus, it helps ensure the rehabilitation of more malleable American prisoners if we ship the really nasty guys to a different prison. Do we really want to be paying exorbitant fees to house chomos and antifa terrorists? Oftentimes they're even the same person.  >But aren't CECOT-type prisons a violation of the 8th Amendment?  ADX Florence is constitutional, so really the question is if it's legal to use a similar prison on foreign soil. We'll see! These are exciting times. Bukele has a 90% approval rating in his country and is one of the greatest leaders of the modern era. A developing partnership with El Salvador under his guidance would be providential.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-15T23:01:04,-369
For people who are sentenced to life without the possibility of parole it makes sense.  It would be a huge cost savings I imagine.,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-04-17T00:16:58,-11

"I disagree, Americans haven't lost our spine yet. I think there's still a lot of appetite for justice reform. Once these plans are more concrete, people are going to love it. And if the Supreme Court rules against the proposal, then well, it was a nice idea to explore options even if it couldn't get off the ground.  Let Trump and Bukele cook. Like, think about it, do you really think there's going to be net unfavorability for sending convicted life-without-parole inmates to El Salvador?",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-15T23:35:05,-155

"Notable that denaturalization is specifically the revocation of citizenship from a **naturalized** U.S. citizen, **not** revoking citizenship from somebody born to American parents.  > > ""*If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat*.”  --Trump  > > ""*There’s obviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution*.” -- Marco Rubio  Housing convicted US citizens in foreign prisons (aka ""offshoring"") is of questionable constitutionality, and would likely violate federal law, specifically the [First Step Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ391/PLAW-115publ391.pdf) (signed by Trump in 2018) which requires BoP to house inmates within “*a facility as close as practicable to the prisoner’s primary residence, and to the extent practicable, in a facility within 500 driving miles of that residence*.”",Kv603,2025-04-15T22:01:37,552

"It costs less money to produce things in China yet we'd like those jobs here presumably. Those countries aren't going to take our prisoners for free and they know what we pay per prisoner. Then you're talking about paying watchdogs on top of that to travel as an official of the US government internationally,which is expensive, to ensure the prisoners rights, which have already been violated by being sent there, are being upheld. Bro, if it's cost prohibitive to jail them here maybe focus on prison reforms here.",Coool_cool_cool_cool,2025-04-16T01:36:01,438
