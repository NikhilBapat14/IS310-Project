"This is simply the latest act in Trump's wanton destruction of the federal government's capacity to serve our nation's interests. There can be no rational justification for the elimination of a program that costs $32 million/year while enabling consumers to save $40 billion/year in energy costs.  Abraham Lincoln wrote: ‚ÄúThe legitimate object of government, is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can not do, at all, or can not, so well do, for themselves‚Äîin their separate, and individual capacities.‚Äù  While it may remain possible for individuals to do the in-depth research needed to compare consumer appliances' efficiency, a government program that requires the clear labeling of appliances is something that I think Lincoln would have supported.  In November 2026, it is essential that every Republican be voted out of office. In 2027, the new House should then immediately impeach Trump and begin the process of rebuilding our nation.",bobwyman,2025-05-06T17:46:35,8

Yup.  Same with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  It costed $800 million to run and returns over $20 billion to taxpayers.  That means shutting down things like the CFPB and Energy Star actually LOSES Americans money.  Of course they‚Äôre not doing it for no reason.  Shutting those down largely benefit wealthy corporations.  So Trump is literally taking money away from everyday Americans and handing it to the wealthy.  As he does with everything else.  Blows my mind that people could see actions like this and still believe Trump cares about working class Americans.  That‚Äôs a cosmic level of stupid.,ShrimpieAC,2025-05-06T17:50:20,53

I think it's in their best interest to pay for independent testing or nobody will buy anything from anybody. Consumers expect to know this information. They won't buy a product that could potentially cost them more money. They simply will go without. It'll cost the manufacturer MORE money to remove that info.,OptimusSublime,2025-05-06T18:57:17,4
