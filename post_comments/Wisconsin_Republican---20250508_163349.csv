"Meanwhile, Massachusetts has both and double the GDP and is the #1 state in giving more money to federal than we receive. Shockingly, Wisconsin takes more than it gives.   GOP just wants people to be poor.",MaddyKet,2025-05-09T02:33:13,2

Republicans hate ordinary hardworking Americans.,Immediate-Boot3786,2025-05-09T07:40:42,1
The partial veto is such an incredible tool to keep Wisconsin from becoming a republican hellscape.  Oh you want to cut 1 million off taxes for people making 10 plus let me just make that a penny instead.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-08T16:45:17,1
"I still want to believe if he was gangsta enough to pardon Ross Ulbricht, he’ll be gangsta enough to legalize nationally. After all, it was his hemp bill in 2018 or so that led to D8 products being ubiquitous, even allowed for some loopholes for real deal D9 edibles to be sold online if 10 mg was contained in a large enough vessel to not reach the percentage threshold",gangstasadvocate,2025-05-08T16:41:29,-9

"That’s not how Republicans really work when it comes to drugs.  They like things the way they are because if it’s a good ole white kid, they can be like “Oh well, it’s just pot” but if it’s black guy they can throw him in jail and take his right to vote.   If you legalize it, you can’t do that. The entire reasoning behind marijuana being illegal is voter suppression and racial discrimination.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-08T16:44:35,12
