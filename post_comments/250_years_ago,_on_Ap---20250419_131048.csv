"It's a good day to reflect on the grievances that the colonies held against King George III:  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good.             He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.              He has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts of People, unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.             He has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.             He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.            …             He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.             He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.             He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harrass our People, and eat out their Substance.             He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.             He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.             He has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:             For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:             For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:             For cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:             For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:             For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:             For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:             For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule into these Colonies:             For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:             For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.             He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.",Adventurous-Bee-498,2025-04-20T03:40:26,43

"I can only imagine the fear and uncertainty in the hearts of these men as they joined up to march out and meet the British, who were a top tier power in the world at the time, if not *the* leading power.   Stories like these make me proud to call myself an American, and continue to give me courage to have a voice against tyranny where it rises. It may not be much of a voice on its own, but neither was one minute man’s musket. Joined together with others, however, and it is a force to be reckoned with.",IRISH81OUTLAWZ,2025-04-19T16:38:33,1
"""But slavery damn it!"" -leftoids  EDIT: Oh wow, let me clearify what I ment with this comment. I was more poking fun at the far left and their tendency to view anything related to the founding of America through only the lens of slavery. Alot of them think that because of slavery, the country was, is and always will be bad. I think these people are incapable of seeing any positives about the founding fathers, everything is just slavery.   Yes slavery was awful and one of America's original sins, I don't deny that at all. The founders were mistaken in not outlawing it with the original draft of the constitution.",VIII_Terror,2025-04-19T13:29:45,-69

"The British /King George targeted militias and armories in particular after Boston Tea Party  Though not explicitly in order, Gage did write what he wanted done. They first went for the armories in Lexington. Ultimately this is why the eventual US government ended up with the 2nd Amendment.  States did not want to be told by (an expected) strong central government to tell them they could not have a militia and armories.   “ a well regulated militia “ is literally the core concept. Not individual owners.",Remote_Clue_4272,2025-04-19T14:10:22,-21

"It's a bit more complicated than large taxes. At the same time of enacting the stamp tax, they also enacted a slew of other demands over the next couple of years until 1776.   Such as the importation act of 1712 that made for the next few years very hard for farmers to export their crops to England. The Stamp Act made future projections miserable after expecting decades of low trade.   Arguably, the biggest tax that crashed markets was the sugar act. America was making bank on selling rum using molasses, and at the time, molasses was a wasteful byproduct from sugar production. We essentially made an entire market from waste, and Britain wanted to tax the new market.   Then you have the soldier act that forced families to house soldiers, and the dismantling of the Massachusetts self governing body. It's no wonder they revolted.",BrittanyBrie,2025-04-20T06:16:04,20
"Another commentor gave a far more detailed description of the grievances that lead up to the Revolution which taxes were a major part of, but what the other commentor is referencing about gun ownership is essentially the spark that pushed the Revolution from grievances and peaceful resistance to force change in policy, to outright rebellion. And after the battle there was no stopping the Revolution from formally kicking off.",War-Damn-America,2025-04-21T08:40:28,1

"Are you really that dumb? Read the federalist papers. The second amendment is literally telling the government they cannot restrict gun ownership to civilians OR a militia. Because again, at the time of ratification, the US had no standing army. Who comprised the militia? Civilians in an organized OR un organized militia. Who comprised the un organized militia? Literally every able bodied US citizen. The US civilian gun owning population is the largest standing army on the planet. ✌🏽gun grabber.",Hezakia84,2025-04-20T06:01:12,17
