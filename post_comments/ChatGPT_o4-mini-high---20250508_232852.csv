"ChatGPT/AI can be a good jumping off point, but they shouldn't be relied on for things like this.    Best/Worst presidents is entirely subjective and opinion based. If you asked 100 people you'd get 100 different lists. Since there's no cohesive answer to the question for AI to find, it's answers are going to vary wildly based on minor variations in the prompt.   You could probably get it to put Harrison at #1 if you framed the question the right way.",JoKo13,2025-05-09T12:02:17,5

These AI things are weird. It’s all professional and academic and then just drops “JFK beefed up border patrols.”  Like surely there’s a more scholarly term for ‘beefed up’,Metalhead831,2025-05-09T08:08:56,6
"Look, I hate Biden as much as the next guy, but he was not worse than fucking Andrew Johnson, Johnson and Buchanan are basically the patron saints of worst presidents of all time ever that'll never get surpassed because both were that bad, Millard Fillmore was worse than Biden, hell, most of those corrupt ass 19th century presidents we had or probably worse than Biden, he was bad for the modern time, but for entire presidential history, he was meh In general, you're going to get results like this with large language models, they don't actually know stuff, they just analyze a shit ton of stored data and pop out something that looks legit",XLII_42,2025-05-09T09:06:30,6
How Washington isn't higher on this list is a bit strange.,Nilmerdrigor,2025-05-09T08:03:36,2

I cannot begin to fathom how much you had to modify this so Trump appeared top ten lmaoo.,No-Definition-5786,2025-05-09T14:41:13,0
What you didn't comment on that relates to your statement were the various parameters I used. Perhaps the query could be improved or made a bit less subjective. Nobody is relying on AI for anything here. Just an interesting experiment. Stating how subjective it is was unhelpful; that is plainly obvious. I get the feeling you didn't even look at the detail.,97E3LPL,2025-05-10T11:26:58,2
"The presidency is a terrible office that has too much power, Harrison is the best president we ever had because he never did anything with it by dying before he could do so That's how I would frame it if you wanted to do that, at least",XLII_42,2025-05-09T14:32:52,1
The point of my post was to share the query parameters and maybe improve it. You make very generalized statements that don't help with a query. How would you put your assertions into parameter form?,97E3LPL,2025-05-10T11:29:03,1
Did you pay any attention at all to the deail or the query text I shared?  Or is this an expected troll comment?,97E3LPL,2025-05-10T11:16:08,1
Expected troll comment. Stupid because: The query is fully disclosed in the post.,97E3LPL,2025-05-10T11:15:07,1
