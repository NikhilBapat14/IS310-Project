"As per [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/25/donald-trump-approval-rating-survey/83279671007/) 📰:  - Within the first 100 days of his second administration President Donald Trump has been incredibly busy, implementing major changes from enacting tariffs to targeting diversity initiatives.    But Americans are divided about whether the changes have been good, according to a recent [survey of more than 900 voters conducted by the New York Times and Siena College Research Institute](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html).  Around 54% of participants said they disapprove of the president’s handling of the economy, immigration, foreign trade and the war between Russia and Ukraine.  The poll reported that 56% of participants said Trump has “gone too far” with changes from enacting tariffs, advancing immigration enforcement and cutting the federal work force.  When asked to describe the second Trump Administration, 66% called his term “chaotic” while 42% used “exciting” and 59% said “scary,” according to the poll.  Overall, his approval rating was at 42%.  Trump’s first 100 days: Here’s 100 things that have changed (so far) Americans criticize economy but support immigration  Though confidence in Trump’s ability to manage the economy was a key selling point to many voters in the November election, 76% of participants said they disapprove of how he’s handling it, the survey said.  While 45% said their personal finances are in good shape, 44% expect to be hurt personally by his economic policies.  Around 52% disapproved Trump’s suggestion to U.S. citizen to prison in El Salvador, the Times/Siena poll reported.  Around 47% opposed the administration’s decision to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and 58% opposed with holding federal funding from certain universities, the survey reported.  Musk has lower approval rating than Trump, poll reports  The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, also received a low approval rating during his stint spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Trump.  The Tesla CEO and presidential adviser received an approval rating of just 35%, the survey reported, with skeptics split a consistently across gender, age, racial and educational demographics.  Survey conductors asked participants twice about the DOGE cuts, once mentioning Musk’s name and again without, according to the Times. Responders were more fond of the cuts when they didn’t hear the name “Musk.”  Trump’s 100th day in office is on Wednesday, April 30.",T_Shurt,2025-04-26T11:12:06,6

"As if all of this wasn't obvious and that Kamala Harris hasn't already warned everyone, word from word, MANY times, that this is exactly what is going to happen, and as if he didn't already try to do much of the very things he is doing now from his first time as President.  Kamala Harris wasn't perfect, but the choice was THAT obvious. Right in your face bad breath smelling point-blank obvious, yet America didn't want her to win either by voting for Trump, voting for Jill Stein, or not voting at all. The most minimal requirement to save this country's shred of freedom and safety they had, and the people just threw it away and let it be thrown away. All because of lack of empathy, laziness, and because this is a a Black Indian woman. That's all it essentially was, no matter what people wanna make up reasons why she lost or why they didn't vote her or anyone at all. Never mind that being a Democrat itself is already very hard due to even one flaw suddenly making them reprehensible in comparison to someone like TRUMP.

Heck, Joe Biden had tons of it, one of his most notable being having Merrick Garland as DOJ, yet it doesn't mean he didn't deserve his place as President, unlike Trump, and the same goes for Harris with what she wanted to do, despite how many of you treat it as. Biden literally saved this country from the near collapse state Trump placed it in from his first presidency. The economy became much better under him, and impressively quick too.  One of the basic factors of literal life is to always choose the option that has the least worries, that being Harris. Just the mere fact that she wouldn't do what Trump wanted to do and to make sure he actually receive the consequences for his crimes should have been enough to have her president, but I guess you don't feel the same, considering you think she shouldn't deserve credit for warning us many times what he was gonna do despite people pulling that out as an excuse as to why they didn't vote for her.

It cannot be repaired or de-escalated immediately. As the saying, it takes much more time to create and repair than to break and destroy. It's obviously a great thing to continue from what he had done and improve even further from that, but now all of that has been thrown out the window and will never see the light of day.

"> to not even vote at all.   I voted for her, so you’re off to a good start with the baseless claims lol  > You wanted a magical, pitch-perfect candidate that can perform miracles, else you wouldn't even reply in disagreement like you are now, considering that nobody said that she isn't perfect and she doesn't deserve criticism.   The person I was replying to literally said the only reason Harris could have lost was “lack of empathy”, “laziness”, and “Black Indian woman”. They claimed every other reason was made up.   Nobody said we should have a magical perfect candidate. I was very specific in my criticism of Harris for running a status quo campaign as a legitimate reason she lost that was in her control.  > deserve his place as President  No one “deserves” to be President lol. The person who makes the best argument for getting people’s votes wins. People who are not good at making that argument should not run for President or accept a VP spot. Harris wasn’t good at that.  > I guess you don't feel the same, considering you think she shouldn't deserve credit for warning us many times what he was gonna do despite people pulling that out as an excuse as to why they didn't vote for her. ""She didn't warn us enough that this was gonna happen!!!""   These are three entirely different points.   I don’t feel that people who ask for the most powerful position in the world should see it as something they deserve. They should earn it and part of that means being able to figure out how people are feeling. If they’re demanding change, and you know that but decide to sell them the status quo, you’re to blame when they reject you. If you can’t make a clear vision for people and just assume it’s obvious you’re better, you’re responsible for that assumption.  Anyone can issue a warning. Middle schoolers in 2015 were already calling Trump the next Hitler. Do they deserve credit too? They must be political prodigies to have the same insight as Harris.  My complaint isn’t that Harris didn’t warn us enough. It’s that she raised $2 billion and ran a bad political campaign when it really mattered.  > She literally advocated better wages and for lowering housing costs  Is anyone advocating for worse wages and more expensive housing lol  There's obviously still many problems in our society even while he was president, and there would have been even when she is president,   > but everything takes time. It cannot be repaired or de-escalated immediately.   It took us 1 year to go from introducing Social Security to giving everyone their card. Look at how long the infrastructure bill makes states wait to accept grant money to begin building (hint: it’s longer). Look at how fast other countries are able to build compared to us, from China to Europe. this includes blue areas like CA and NY where Dems run everything. We are uniquely bad right now for no clear reason.   If we as Dems are arguing that government can do good things, we need to have clear answers for why that is since it hasn’t been working so far. This is where Republicans have a clearer answer than Democrats, even if it’s a really bad one.   It’s also a choice to ignore short-term issues in favor of long-term ones.

I don't think Wall Street realizes how complex the supply change is, or how many components are involved from so many multiple production facilities spread across the globe. Just the shipping confusion will cripple supply lines.  The US tourism market, worth $250 billion a year, is as good as dead. Treasury Bills, the debt that keeps us all going, have been undermined. It is the excess capital of trade deficits that gives nations the liquidity and dollars to purchase T-Bills, and that whole system is in flux.

What makes more sense: people wanted lies and instability, or that you might be biased into thinking Harris’ offer of stability was convincing?

Yes, MAGA lies and uses propaganda to make Biden and the Dems seem bad. That’s nothing new for the right.
