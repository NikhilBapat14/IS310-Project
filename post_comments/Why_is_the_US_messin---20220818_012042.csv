"Trade talks are a form of dialogue with China to get back to some kind of normal so that’s not really ‘messing’ with China.  Pelosi visited Taiwan for roughly 12 hours in-between trips elsewhere. She isn’t the first nor the last Congressmember to do that. That’s Congress’ right. China chose to overreact in that case and throw a fit for no apparent reason. So, again, not really messing with anyone. Probably the greater question is why China is messing with Taiwan - there should be greater priorities.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-19T07:26:54,8
"Why is the US visiting Taiwan ""messing"" with China? Taiwan served an important part of the US economy--the vast majority of our superconducters are manufactured there and they've been an ally of ours for a long time. Are you suggesting the US should get permission from other powers before it pursues its economic interests? Put another way, why isn't China getting bent out of shape that we visit a country we've had relations with for half a century them messing with us?   Just because China is mad doesn't mean the US is antagonizing them. Just by default, China and the US have different priorities, so any time the US pursues its interests, China will be less happy. But from that perspective, China being unhappy because it can't pursue its interests that are contradictory to the US's desires folks who want the US goals to succeed should be happy.  I mean, American voters have wanted the US to be tough on China for a long time. That's been a consistent thing the voters have asked for since at least Trump's term, and it's been across both parties. So the US does it, and China is upset (which means it's working), and voter are concerned? Do voters expect that when the US got ""tough"" on China that China would say ""yes daddy USA please more?""   The US did something they had a right to do, and it was by every definition a peaceful, reasonable action. China is mad because they couldn't stop the US, and taking any retaliatory measures would *significantly* undermine China's claim that this is all about security and peace. US citizens that want the US to be strong and able to pursue its interests (and every US citizen should want that) should be thrilled that China's a bit peeved right now. It means the US policy is working, and China appears weak, and can't do anything about it.",mormagils,2022-08-22T09:35:49,2
"Because China was antagonizing the US first?  At least in terms of recent actions.  China has been doing a lot of very bad stuff of late.  So the description of 'the US messing with China' doesn't seem apt.  The problem is China is acting more violent and unreasonable, which leads to conflict with others who have interests in the area.  Just because someone is having trouble in one area doesn't mean they can afford to abandon others.",zlefin_actual,2022-08-21T15:26:53,1
"I should have clarified. The US is opening trade talks with Taiwan, not China. Whether China’s reaction seems reasonable or not, these actions are pretty provocative and the US must be well aware of that. I’m not questioning if US is justified, just the timing.",yer_deterred,2022-08-19T08:44:07,1
">Are you suggesting the US should get permission from other powers before it pursues its economic interests?   No.  >The US did something they had a right to do, and it was by every definition a peaceful, reasonable action.  Actually I'm not suggesting anything about who has a right to do anything. I'm just wondering why the US government chose this moment to make a move.  I'm making two broad assumptions:  1) The US government is acting in a coordinated and intentional way. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and US diplomats are taking part in a coordinated plan and implementing an agreed upon China policy where the actions and possible outcomes have all been considered.  2) The US is not motivated by altruism. Meaning the US does not act selflessly in the defense of other countries and/or moral principals. Our government and leadership are motivated primarily by self-interest.  If you accept these assumptions, what do you think the US game plan is here? What leverage does the US think it has at this moment that allows it to put pressure on China and what does it hope to gain?",yer_deterred,2022-08-22T11:22:54,1
"I'd argue that it's not 'provocative' to ask the burglar to leave your house. If the burglar didn't want to be 'provoked', they shouldn't have broken in.  China has been acting in a hostile and acquisitive manner towards its neighbors for years. Calling basic diplomacy with those neighbors 'provocative' stretches the definition of the word to its breaking point.  In terms of 'timing', it really boils down to the simple question: what are they going to do about it? China can't win a war in the South China Sea and it's unlikely this will change any time soon. They can't impose major trade sanctions without incurring retaliatory sanctions that would hurt them more than their trading partners.  So if China wants to act like a petulant child upset over a time-out, they're free to do so. But that doesn't mean the time-out wasn't justified.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T13:22:31,8
"The US is doing economically bad, if not terrible. And there's a lot of discontent.  Picking random fights always helps with focusing attention where you want it and it unifies the people against a common enemy.  It also has to do with international politics. Part of why the US is rich and powerful is because the world perceives them as rich and powerful, it means countries listen to them and that they trust the US currency. It might be a self-fulfilling prophecy but that's how economics and politics work: Trust and/or fear. If the US loses that recognition they will lose a lot of that wealth and power.",Hapsbum,2022-08-21T04:40:12,1
"\> Actually I'm not suggesting anything about who has a right to do anything.   Right, I do get that. I was intentionally reframing this to get you to see it from a different perspective. The point here was to help you see that your axis for this needs to be recalibrated.  \> I'm just wondering why the US government chose this moment to make a move.  I don't know that this was a moment ""chosen"" to make a move. The Biden administration has been doing what it wants whether China approves or not from day 1. Remember when Biden made his first call to Xi Jinping just after taking office and Xi got a little miffed when Biden pushed on the Uyghur treatment among other things. Or look at the conference in Alaska where China left complaining that the US was doing what they wanted enough. Every few months for the past year and a half China has teased sending out naval forces as a show of strength--recently Biden responded by sending OUR navy as a show of force and China backed off. This Pelosi visit seems to just be a continuation of everything else that's happening with China and the US. I think the timing has more to do with this being when Pelosi has a chance to go on a trip than it does anything else.  \> If you accept these assumptions, what do you think the US game plan is here? What leverage does the US think it has at this moment that allows it to put pressure on China and what does it hope to gain?  I do accept your assumptions, and the gain here is stronger ties with Taiwan as well as a signal to China that imperialistic military action will not be tolerated. This is especially relevant with the Russia-Ukraine situation, and it's possible that China is looking at that situation which did not involved NATO military action defending Ukraine as an opportunity for them to make a similar pre-emptive invasion and annex Taiwan for real. Pelosi's visit sends the signal that the US does see Taiwan as independent, and the US not backing down despite China's military promises allows the US to show that in a battle of wills between China and the US, the US will prevail.   Essentially, it's a projection of US soft power that many feel has been weakening while China's has been gaining. The US taking these opportunities allows them to show that they still have more soft power than anyone else in the world, even China.",mormagils,2022-08-22T11:56:58,2
