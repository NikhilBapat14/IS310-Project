"As someone who considers myself a 2nd amendment ""absolutist"" (for the most part) i think the biggest gun regulations that would make sense involve charging parents with crimes if their children get access to and commit a crime. Too many school shootings happen because someone steals dad's gun which shouldn't be possible. We need to hold parents accountable for being irresponsible.    But banning things like ""high capacity magazines"" or semi automatic weapons is unconstitutional and doesn't even achieve the stated goals.",Gullible-Ideal8731,2025-04-15T19:18:00,4
"How many times will it take for you guys to get it through your thick skulls that guns are not the problem. Stop listening to the media spewing the shit that it’s an “American” problem. This happens all over the world and yeah it’s wrong. 50 years ago gun violence was not a problem. Moreover the problem lies with parents, media, and the state of the world. The right to bear arms should never be changed but proper gun safety and securing weapons should be.",Flashy_Ad_7415,2025-04-15T21:43:44,1

At least one person has been taken away from the campus in an emergency vehicle. I think it was an ambulance but I can’t tell. I saw them load someone in it on a stretcher tho. I’m watching it on the local news. This nonsense has to stop,Cody-512,2025-04-15T14:29:59,1
"I don’t agree with bans, but there should be stricter background checks, mental wellness exams, mandatory training, etc. That includes people (and children) that will be in close proximity to the firearm. This will never happen, though, because of government overreach (and how a government could use this against their citizens).   I just wish it was safer out here…",Elegant-Champion-615,2025-04-15T19:47:33,3
">But banning things like “high capacity magazines” or semi automatic weapons is unconstitutional and doesn’t even achieve the stated goals.  I agree. In NY they passed a law stating you couldn’t have more than 5 rounds in a magazine. I laughed at that. The law abiding gun owner, who does everything by the book, can only have 5 bullets? Meanwhile the criminal who shouldn’t have the gun in the first place can have a clip with 12,15,30, however many rounds? Makes as much sense as putting up your hands to stop the wind.",swordrat720,2025-04-16T04:32:36,1
What I said was there needs to be common sense laws. I didn’t say to ban guns or anything else close to that. There’s never gonna be any sort of reform in that area bc Republicans sold out to the NRA a long time ago in spite of the majority of the country being in favor of these types of laws being passed,Cody-512,2025-04-15T23:38:10,1
"As far as it being a global problem, not just an American problem, ur right. In America we have had about 300 school shootings as of 9-18-24, depending on what definition you use and which reference you use. 300 is an *extremely* conservative number, but I’ll use it to make my point. Obviously, that’s number one in the world. The next closest country is Mexico. They had a total of 8 in their country’s history. For every 1 school shooting they have, we have 37.5 school shootings. S Africa has had 6, two others have had 4, Afghanistan has had 3, three have had 2, & nine had 1. So yeah, it’s a global problem, but it’s primarily an American problem & sitting around not changing anything bc the NRA wouldn’t like it is stupid.   https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/school-shootings-by-country",Cody-512,2025-04-16T00:05:13,2
"Student witnesses say they heard what sounded like 7 shots in the hallway at school and claim to have seen, “a lot of blood on the floor,” and that “a lot of ppl bring guns up here every day.” Again, this claim is from an eighteen yr old student at that hs who heard multiple shots from inside her classroom and had to take shelter & go on lockdown. A teacher had to put a tunicate on the leg of the shot kid’s leg until he could be taken out by paramedics for further medical treatment.   Thank you to any teachers out there reading this for all you do. Y’all aren’t paid enough for what u have to do for the communities u serve in",Cody-512,2025-04-15T14:43:40,3

"Throwing out numbers without context ignores the bigger picture. Yes, the U.S. has more school shootings, but blaming guns alone is lazy and short-sighted. Fifty years ago, we had easier access to guns and fewer laws—yet nowhere near this level of violence. What’s changed isn’t the guns, it’s the culture, the breakdown of the family, lack of accountability, mental health, and nonstop media glorifying violence. Countries like Switzerland have high gun ownership but don’t have this problem (BBC). That tells you it’s not about the gun, it’s about the person holding it. Instead of pushing for gun control that punishes responsible gun owners, we should focus on enforcing existing laws, promoting real gun safety, and fixing the root causes of why kids are picking up guns in the first place.",Flashy_Ad_7415,2025-04-16T07:25:51,1
"Now they’re reporting a total of 3 students were shot. 2 in the leg & 1 in the hip. It’s unclear if any were targeted. None are considered to have critical injuries. As of 2:38, it was unclear if the shooter was captured.  So there u go. Thanks, Republicans. Thanks for valuing donations from the NRA over the safety and morale of our children & communities & our Nation. Forget that the majority of Americans want common sense gun laws, bc that’s not as profitable as the NRA’s pocket change. And thanks for underpaying our teachers, too, while I’m on one. They have a job that puts urs to shame & if u tried to do theirs for a semester you’d actually realize how stupid it is to expect them to put in the amt of work they do for what they earn. Now we want them to babysit kids, manage angry parents, and be part time paramedics to ffs? I’m honestly surprised u let em’ earn what u do. And now u got Abbott trying to enact vouchers to screw over the public schools even more. There really is a special place in hell for certain ppl",Cody-512,2025-04-15T14:56:22,1
"Sweden gun laws vs. the US Despite Sweden and the US having two of the world’s highest gun ownership rates, Sweden only has about 14% of firearm fatalities than that in the US, with only two mass shootings between 1983 and 2013, while the US had 78 (39 times more than Sweden’s mass shooting count).   Sweden gun laws are known to be notoriously strict as all licenses can only be obtained directly by Sweden’s police department, justified with a reasoned purpose and having passed requirements such as passing the hunting exam or being an established member of a recognized shooting club for six months. Swedes often apply for gun licenses for hunting, gun collection, or sport shooting. In addition, guns owned must be securely stowed in secure and approved vaults under Swedish gun laws.   In contrastingly, the US is relatively more flexible and gun ownership as it is stated in the Second Amendment of the Constitution: “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”  [source link](https://www.lifeinsweden.net/sweden-gun-laws/#Sweden_gun_laws_vs_the_US)",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-16T09:45:05,1
