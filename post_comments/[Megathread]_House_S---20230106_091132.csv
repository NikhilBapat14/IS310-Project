Let's say this drags on for months. Does that mean the only functioning body of the legislative branch is the senate?   What can be done if only the senate is operating? I know judges are one thing but is there anything else that only they can take care of?,p8ntballnxj,2023-01-06T11:49:31,15
Why don't moderate Republicans punish McCarthy for giving so many concessions to the far right extremists?,[deleted],2023-01-06T09:43:51,16

I just had a curious thought. How is it that these House members can vote on a speaker before they have even been sworn in as a House member?  Who is entitled to vote for Speaker? Where does this power come from?,Chibano,2023-01-06T15:08:56,4
"What if this debacle was happening in a Presidential Election year? Would not having a speaker prevent them from certifying the results of the election? If they didn't have a speaker by January 20th and the election was still uncertified, would the Pro Tem become President once the President & VP's terms expired? Could this be an MO of congress members who want to overturn election results in the future?",LetsGetRowdyRowdy,2023-01-06T16:14:58,1
"Question and apologies if already answered. With the rule changes allowing for a single member to trigger the vote for a new speaker is that only for Republican members or does it apply to the entire House? In other words, could a single Democrat trigger the process if only a single member is needed? Thanks!",macshuffle,2023-01-09T15:37:34,1
Did Pelosi ever kick a republican off of a committee like McCarthy just did to Adam Schiff?  What is the House rule that allows a Speaker to chose which members of the opposite party can sit on committees?    Can McCarthy replace all a committee's democrats with republicans?,Astro3840,2023-01-19T19:23:33,1

"The Senate can also approve nominations of executive branch officials, ratify treaties, and hold hearings/conduct investigations. (The last one isn't something that *only* the Senate can do, but it can be done independently of the House.)",curien,2023-01-06T13:01:16,6

"It would likely get delayed. The Constitution only requires that President provide from time to time a statement on the state of the union. Through most of our country's history, this was just a letter the President sent to Congress. It's now a speech, but there is no requirement about when or how often it must be done.  You might recall Trump had his State of the Union delayed in 2019 during a government shutdown, so it isn't unprecedented for the speech to get delayed over more pressing government business.",ProLifePanda,2023-01-06T13:26:41,17

There's still a Clerk of the House and the vote for Speaker is the first order of business. The current Clerk (Cheryl Johnson) can run the show up until a Speaker is elected.,SouthOfOz,2023-01-06T17:26:49,4

"That is correct. Article II Section 1.3 says:  > The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates \[...\]  With no constitutionally elected President, the old President would leave and we'd progress down the line of succession: * no VP (for the same reason as no president) * no Speaker of the House * Pro Tempore wins a new job!  They would need to resign from the Senate to become acting President, and then they would be removed from the presidency if/when the House finally got together and properly elected the President-elect.   It would be up to the Pro Temp's state's law to determine who replaced them in the Senate (potentially with their governor reinstating them), but there would also probably soon be a special election for the rest of their term.  Imagine this all happening in a 50-50 divided Senate, with the Senate being in control of the opposite party of the House majority. Added chaos: then imagine the Pro Temp's Governor is the same party as the House and instead replaces them with their own pick.",craftworkbench,2023-01-07T13:06:23,1

Why would dems vote for the guy who is giving concessions to far right extremists instead of giving concessions to them?  Why is he giving up so many concessions to 20 far right extremists instead of trying to make deals with 200 Democrats?,[deleted],2023-01-06T10:46:17,25
"I was just listening to a podcast and the speaker said the dems should throw their votes to Boebert. The House, after all, is going to get nothing done for the next two years, so why not just turn it into the major shitshow it will be a bit early. The point was, since the magats will be fighting the rest of their party, put it all on display for the whole country. Show the country the GQP at their worst.",DevCatOTA,2023-01-06T19:36:27,3

">Why would dems vote for the guy who is giving concessions to far right extremists instead of giving concessions to them?  In this vein, it seems that broadcasting these concessions is a solidly good strategy for the dems.",Fractal_Soul,2023-01-06T12:18:15,3

"It would be for when the House and President are on the same team but the Senate is the other team.   In more concrete terms, let's say the two parties are the Flarkens and the Ardballs. * the Flarkens have won the House and Presidency (President-Elect at the moment) * the Ardballs control the Senate, but only with a 51-49 majority * the Flarkens delay certification until after the old president leaves office. * an Ardball Senator, as Pro Tempore, succeeds them as Acting President, resigning from the Senate to do so. The Ardballs now have a 50-49 majority in the Senate * the Flarkens then immediately certify the election, taking over the Presidency and ousting the Acting President * the former-Pro Temp/-Acting President is now jobless * their state has a Flarken Governor, who temporarily seats a Flarken in that vacated senate seat * the Flarkens now control the House, the Presidency, and the Senate (via a 50-50 tie broken by their VP)  Of course, **it should be obvious that this would be an absolutely bonkers scenario that would be challenged legally, politically, and socially (ie protests).**  But as a hypothetical, it's interesting that it might technically be legal.",craftworkbench,2023-01-07T19:14:40,2
"Why would a ""flarken"" want to deny their own president a certification? Just to shift the balance of the Senate very temporarily until a special can be held?  Also, not to mince words here, because we all know which party would try to undermine the results of an election, Republicans would be the ones playing this game. Pro Tem is typically the most senior member of the majority party, or the second-most senior if the most senior didn't want the job (like now). You'd need to go way down the line of succession to Bernie Sanders to get a Democratic Senator with a Republican governor.   My question is, would a Republican house be able to deny certification of a Democratic president indefinitely if they refused to nominate a Speaker by 1/20?",LetsGetRowdyRowdy,2023-01-07T19:31:15,1
"Correct, the goal would be to delay just long enough to pop that Senator out and then immediately replace them with your preferred candidate.  I used the hypothetical party names just to make the example more objective.  Sure, a party probably could delay choosing a Speaker. I'm sure there are other possibly-legal (and potentially easier) ways to prevent a President from being seated than essentially decapitating your own majority. You'd need iron-clad control over the difference between majority and minority to prevent moderate members of your party abandoning your chicanery to vote for the minority Speaker candidate. (In today's terms, 4-5 moderate Republicans supporting Jeffries.)",craftworkbench,2023-01-07T21:37:16,1
