"Link to the [article](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/25/us-citizen-deportation-donald-trump-00311631).   “U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump appointee, said the child — identified in court papers by the initials “V.M.L.” — appeared to have been released in Honduras earlier Friday, along with her Honduran-born mother and sister, who had been detained by immigration officials earlier in the week.  The judge on Friday scheduled a hearing for May 16, which he said was “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.” The child, whose redacted U.S. birth certificate was filed in court and showed she was born in New Orleans in 2023, had been with her mother and sister during a regular immigration check-in at the New Orleans office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday. Officials there detained them and queued them up for deportation.  Trump administration officials said in court that the mother told ICE officials that she wished to take V.M.L. with her to Honduras. The filing included a handwritten note in Spanish they claimed was written by the mother and confirmed her intent. But the judge said he had hoped to verify that information.  “The Government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote. “But the Court doesn’t know that.”  The court battle ignited Thursday, when lawyers for the family filed an emergency petition in the Western District of Louisiana seeking V.M.L.’s immediate release from ICE custody and a declaration that the girl’s detention had been unlawful. The petition was filed under the name of Trish Mack, who the lawyers indicated had been asked by V.M.L.’s father to act as the child’s custodian and take her home from ICE custody. Lawyers for the guardian told the court that V.M.L.’s father had been attempting to contact the girl’s mother to discuss plans for their child but ICE officials denied him the chance to have a substantive phone call. He says ICE allowed the two to speak for about one minute on Tuesday, while the mother was in ICE custody, but that they were unable to make any meaningful decisions about their child.  …  Even as Doughty made clear that he was disturbed by the government’s actions, in his order Friday the judge seemed to tip his hat to the president, adopting the term “Gulf of America” for the body of water traditionally known as the Gulf of Mexico.  The Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",Hike_and_Go891,2025-04-25T20:16:31,35

"The Constitution of the United States.  The highest law of the land. The framework of freedom. The last line of defense between people and tyranny. It belongs to every American. Not to presidents. Not to parties. Not to billionaires.  Donald Trump spit on it.  Article I - Separation of Powers: Trump uses the DOJ as a personal hit squad. Shields himself. Hunts enemies. Pardons criminals who serve him.  Article II - Executive Accountability: Trump claims ""total immunity."" Demands unchecked power. Dreams of jailing critics. Dreams of ruling by decree.  Article III - Judicial Independence: Trump stacks courts with loyalists. Undermines judges. Smears juries. Declares courts ""rigged"" if they dare to say he is guilty.  First Amendment - Free Speech, Press, Assembly: Trump demonizes the free press. Calls journalists ""enemies of the people."" Encourages violence. Threatens to shut media down.  Fourteenth Amendment - Equal Protection: Trump targets immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ citizens. Separates families. Bans religious groups. Praises white supremacists.  Voting Rights - Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth Amendments: Trump lies about elections. Throws out ballots. Tries to nullify democracy if he loses.  Every word Trump speaks is a defilement of the Constitution.  And it’s not just him. It’s every last rotting loyalist still breathing government air:  Mark Meadows Jim Jordan Marjorie Taylor Greene Ron DeSantis Josh Hawley Lindsey Graham Brett Kavanaugh Amy Coney Barrett And the hundreds more who traded America for a seat at Trump’s table.  They have sworn allegiance to one man. Not the law. Not the Constitution. Not the People.  This is sedition.  This is betrayal.  This is how republics fall.  What must be done? NOW?  1. Call, email, fax, and show up at every elected official’s office. Demand they disqualify Trump and his loyalists under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Demand impeachment. Demand removal.  2. Name and archive every official, judge, officer who swore loyalty to Trump. Permanent records. Permanent consequences. No forgiveness without public repentance.  3. Organize mass protests. Not one day. Every day. Every city. Make tyranny impossible to ignore.  4. Boycott every company funding MAGA candidates. Publicize their names. Crush their profits. Force them to choose democracy or dictatorship.  5. Create citizen watchdog groups. Show up. Demand answers. Shut down corruption before it breeds again.  6. Pressure allies abroad to sanction Trump’s regime if he seizes power. Force international isolation until democracy is restored.  7. Refuse normalization. Never say “both sides.” Never call this ""politics."" It’s sedition. It’s treason. Call it what it is.  8. Force televised accountability hearings. Every crime. Every betrayal. Drag it into the light.  9. Demand constitutional reforms. Presidential immunity must end. Insurrection clauses must have teeth. Voting rights must be bulletproof.  10. Swear this cancer will never grow again.  This is the line.  Right here. Right now.  Trump is not just a bad president. He is a clear and present danger to the Republic. Every loyalist helping him is an enemy of democracy.  This is not politics. This is survival.  Choose your side.  Choose it now.  History will never forgive cowardice dressed as neutrality.",CannaB-Ber,2025-04-26T15:54:24,3

"I am German — someone whose family suffered deeply under Nazism, losing multiple family members to its brutality. I sincerely hope you will recognize the dangerous patterns emerging today. We have seen this before.  * Arresting judges — In 1933, the Nazi regime forced judges to swear loyalty to the new government. Those who resisted faced dismissal, arrest, or worse. Hans Litten, a lawyer known for challenging the Nazis, was arrested that year and later died in Dachau in 1938. Judicial independence was systematically destroyed.  * Attacks at universities — The University of Berlin (now Humboldt University) became a center of Nazi influence. On May 10, 1933, students organized the infamous book burnings, targeting intellectual freedom. Under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (April 1933), professors were purged for political or racial reasons. - In 1943, students at the University of Munich formed the White Rose resistance against Nazism. They were arrested and executed for distributing anti-Nazi leaflets, showing how even academic dissent was crushed.  Etc etc etc.....  * Branding of the neurodivergent — Forced sterilizations began in 1934 under the ""Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring."" By 1939, Aktion T4 expanded into mass killings of those with disabilities, branding them ""life unworthy of life.""  * A dangerous sense of superiority — From early on, the regime promoted an ideology of racial and cultural superiority, scorning much of Europe as weak, decadent, or inferior. - JD VANCE & CO  * Isolationist politics — In October 1933, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, abandoning international cooperation to pursue aggressive nationalist policies.  * Prosecution without due process — The Gestapo and special courts (Sondergerichte) allowed the regime to arrest and imprison without fair trials, often based only on political suspicion.  * Oppression and abuse of minorities — Romani people, political dissidents, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others were marginalized, stripped of their rights, and subjected to systemic abuse under the regime’s expanding oppressive laws.  This is why I am here, speaking out in American forums: To raise awareness that what is happening now is more dangerous than most people realize. I could give at least 10 more examples.
