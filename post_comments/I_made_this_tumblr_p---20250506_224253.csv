"Biden did a ton of good things and not just for his base. The problem is that people (and not just in the US) are becoming ungovernable. Everyone thinks they are far smarter than they actually are, everyone has become insatiable and unwilling to accept compromise, everyone is devouring mis and disinformation, everyone has made perfect the enemy of good, and everyone wants it all, right now, with no cost, waiting or effort.  Trump isn't the problem. We get the government we deserve. There will always be a 'Trump' as long as voters are this disconnected from reality.",beenyweenies,2025-05-07T10:34:15,38

Purple State swing voters were not going to vote for Biden after the debate.  Only way Trump would have lost in 2024 is if Biden stepped down and the Dems had a robust primary.,Then_Entertainment97,2025-05-07T08:09:05,-2
"That’s accurate. Unfortunately.  Another giant part of the problem is the antiquated 2-party system. Both parties have changed so much since I started voting ~20ish years ago, I have always had a hard time fully identifying with either of them. So I voted the person, not the party, until Trump exposed the modern Republican party as a fascist christian nationalist party and made being neutral and balanced impossible. The left at least seems to have good intentions most of the time, while the “right” is incredibly mean and self-serving (as well as consistently disregarding our constitutional rights).  I really don’t like or understand how so many people treat their political party affiliation like a sports team; it’s glaringly obvious when they don’t know any of the issues yet they’ll cheer on their team *no matter what.* Very few of them actually understand what is going on in the world. They tune in to their Fox News and Truth Social propaganda outlets to “stay informed,” or rather, to stay angry at democrats and be coached on how to argue topics they’ve probably never thought about before. Since their “news” about Trump is always sugarcoated and framed in a positive light, it’s less of a win and more of a “*Trumpian perceived win, factual loss.*”  I don’t like that there was no action taken by our alleged “checks and balances” to prevent a felon rapist who incited an insurrection from ever running for office again. I don’t like that Trump has escaped any real consequences for his crimes, crimes he will continue to commit as he finishes dismantling modern America. Mall security guards have better hiring standards and vetting practices than the “most powerful office in the world.” Wild.  I’d like to see a movement encouraging people to vote as an independent in the next election. Use phrases like “bow down to no one,” “hold ALL politicians accountable,” “politicians didn’t earn & don’t deserve your loyalty,” “pledge allegiance to your country, not your candidate,” etc. That kind of campaign could help secure some votes with the people that identify as republican but don’t agree with how Trump does things. In a lot of ways, voting as an independent is the simplest most patriotic thing you could do in your regular life. We know MAGA the sports team won’t tolerate voters thinking for themselves, so it could be framed as “a Republican effort to increase voter education” or something sneaky.  We know that that the constitution doesn’t actually serve a purpose if people don’t read it, nor do they have the spine to enforce it. I’m fairly confident we’ll see Trump running for a 3rd term, and his base will eagerly allow it, and the opposition will be outraged but shrug and do nothing.",PerfectlySoggy,2025-05-07T14:26:17,11
"*Trump voters* tend to think they’re far smarter than they are. I’m no genius, but at least I can understand and absorb basic facts, and am willing to admit when I’m wrong in the light of new, legitimate information. I’m not Dunning-Kruger’d to the point I believe I’m actually smarter than Jerome Powell, *ahhhctually*, like so many of his dimwit acolytes. I don’t think I’m smarter than people in the medical field because doctors are practiced and spend long hours doing what they do. I don’t rant online about how Dr. Fauci is a criminal and that masks are evil.   The problem is that we have too many Americans seemingly stuck at an 80 IQ with no intention of reading a history book. So they’ll continue to be fleeced by snake oil salesmen until the end of time.",thebrads,2025-05-08T07:25:40,7

This is such a phony narrative. There wasn’t enough time for a “robust” primary. It would’ve been thrown together at the last minute and the result would’ve been the same: Harris would’ve been nominated and likely with token opposition. Who else would’ve had the money and staff in place to attempt a run on such short notice?  Biden should not have attempted to run at all. That’s the only way you get a “robust” primary.,BippidiBoppetyBoob,2025-05-07T10:04:15,8
