"Jesus, Reuters, ""overturning the world order"" almost makes the convicted felon's trail of chronic stumbling calamity sound like a *good* thing",realancepts4real,2025-04-27T06:45:25,11
" The damage is already done, there is no going back without radical changes to the government and this administration being harshly punished for their actions with prison sentences so other countries regain some faith in the people of this country.",Deep_Alps7150,2025-04-27T05:02:59,23
"Turns out that if you deny the existence of shared values and long term alliances and ties of friendship and affection and history and bloodshed and sacrifice, and instead insist that everything be purely transactional and demand that they stop ""ripping you off,"" well...then other countries will simply say ""it was nice while it lasted"" and politely (or impolitely depending on their culture) invite you to go fuck yourself.",specqq,2025-04-27T05:06:39,9

"We have to remember that the whole world is watching. We sold the world for the last 200 plus years that we are the Shining Light on the hill. We even told people that the Statue of Liberty is all about sending us your huddled masses and your poor. We've lashed out for decades about bad guys, con men, dictators, and terrorists. We spilled our blood in World Wars, and we built up Nations after those wars and spent trillions of dollars in doing so. And along comes Donald Trump, who in one fell swoop destroyed everything that we've built. And yes, the world is watching, and it'll watch what we do to Trump and all his underlings. Are we going to send them to The World Court at The Hague and try them for crimes, or we're going to let them walk away like Richard Nixon did. Brazil is putting its criminal on trial. Argentina and Chile did likewise. The world is watching what's going to happen. Stay tuned to this channel.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-27T05:57:36,2

That world order is literally called the liberal order. Doesn’t sound like something MAGA likes. Maybe you have heard about this thing called ”own the libs”.,Ennegerboll,2025-04-27T08:36:33,1

"The fact Russia bombed Chernobyl would be an act of war on Western Europe and an attack on NATO , the US has a long history of looking the other way with Russia , in WW2 Hitler and Stalin had a pact to carve up Eastern Europe , after WW2 it seems the US had a similar pact , the curtain has fallen revealing an alliance or understanding of two nations doing what the hell they want because playing good cop bad cop used to be profitable for them , until China put a spanner in the works .",HankuspankusUK69,2025-04-27T10:45:58,1
