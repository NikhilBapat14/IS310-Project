"Just a guess, but could it be a deep seeded racism born of being a ""closed"" (to immigration) society for a millennium or two that persecuted the indigenous people to at least the same degree we did?",Olderscout77,2023-03-26T12:30:33,3
Immigration is not an end all solution by any means.  Japan is a homogenous country and a great example of what one people can accomplish when they are hardworking and resolute in achieving national greatness.,[deleted],2023-04-07T06:27:41,1
">It's also a very ethnically and culturally homogenous country at present (and has been for a very long time), and they like it that way.   Some of the Scandinavian countries are like this too (most  are small -- [the largest barely has 10 million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1296240/nordics-total-population/)).   Quite a few societies have been the same for centuries and, as you put it, ""like it that way.""  Is there a way to hold this view about your culture and *not* be racist?  Guess not.",Markdd8,2023-03-26T14:50:19,2
"I believe it’s more of a resistance to change involving their culture and not necessary a race thing.  Inviting immigrants means having to accept cultural differences and potential influences on their own. Living on an Island for so many generations have made the people deeply rooted in customs. Thus its hard for even Christianity to penetrate.  The Japanese people have learned to embrace these customs and culture and maybe feel that it’s complete.   The Japanese people are very culture oriented. Anything that could affect this, may need to be scrutinized.",Silly_Ad2805,2023-03-29T01:05:43,1
"Except for you know, all the cultural influence from Europe, China, Korea, etc.  Japan is not culturally homogeneous. Even now, there is a stark divide between rural and urban life.",marciamakesmusic,2023-06-22T11:57:54,1
They don’t want the problems that other nations are experiencing through immigration. It’s costly with no longterm benefits. It invites more problems.,Silly_Ad2805,2023-03-29T00:45:19,0
How would you solve the long term problems that Japan will and is suffering from? Immigration seems the most logical choice to me.,Jacen_Vos,2023-07-25T02:21:38,1
">Inviting immigrants means having to accept cultural differences and potential influences on their own. Living on an Island for so many generations have made the people deeply rooted in customs. Thus its hard for even Christianity to penetrate.  This is a nationalist myth, though. It was never true. Japan has always been deeply connected to its neighbors. Buddhism came to Japan from Korea. Its government structures were based first on China, then  Germany and the current one was literally created by Americans. No matter how hard it tried, Japan was never able to unseat Christianity once it got a foothold. Japan uses a Chinese writing system. There have been 100,000s Korean and Taiwanese people in Japan since the 19th century, and Japan itself has multiple indigenous minorities (the Ainu people,  Ryukyuans) and an ""untouchable caste"" (Burakumin""). The idea of a culturally homogenous Japan was just never really true.",loselyconscious,2023-03-30T03:16:13,4
"I recently read that the US population would be shrinking (slightly) if it wasn't for immigration. From what I've read, the only ""down side"" is immigrants frighten conservatives.",Olderscout77,2023-03-29T06:40:18,3
"I disagree. My parents are immigrants and so are many conservatives.   Conservatives are much like the Japanese in many ways. They want to conserve American values and part culture.   We have a population here that refuses to conform. While these groups aren’t immigrants, they blame the government for much of their growth, financial and educational issues whilst committing a high percentage of crime compared to immigrants and whites and single-motherhood rates in the community is high.   I find that life is easier if one conforms to the country they live in. This can be done without hiding your culture and native tongue, so long as it doesn’t impede on others and that the country’s values or culture are held.",Silly_Ad2805,2023-03-29T09:42:45,0
"I disagree with most of what you say. My grandparents were immigrants and I was a Republican until Reagan turned Republicans against my country.  The only things many conservatives want to conserve these days are racism and sexism. Most of these factors have been made part of the law, it was called ""slavery"" and then ""Jim Crow"" and now ""tRumpism"". Those who wish to retain their ""native tongue"" are condemned to live in ghettos - been that way forever, not going to change, so learning English is essential to joining in full participation in American society. This is especially true as the citizenship ""test"" still requires a working knowledge of English AND a civics section requiring a better understanding of how our Government works than a disturbing number of our high schools provides natural born Americans.  As for crime rates, a great deal of what you seem to think is related to skin color has long been proven to be more related to how and where police spend their time enforcing the law. There are no studies showing POC are more likely to *use* drugs than whites in the same economic group, but POC are two to three times as likely to be ARRESTED for drug use, which thanks to Nixon's War on Drugs (used by hippies and Blacks) this costs them their jobs because of excessive bail (miss work), then criminal records barring them from many other jobs, producing single parent families which keep kids from seeing how grownups are supposed to live together, and so on. Not sure why you think they should not have a problem with the government that is the agency doing all this to them.",Olderscout77,2023-03-29T15:51:25,5
