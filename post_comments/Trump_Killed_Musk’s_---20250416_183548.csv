"I am begging Dems to go harder on the weirdness of Elon creating a ‚Äúlegion‚Äù of kids with many strange women, like literally DM‚Äôing women on X to carry his seed (barf). It‚Äôs the opposite of what Republicans claim to be as the family values party. We can take that back or at least should fight to try.",Timely-Ad-4109,2025-04-16T19:45:54,219

"Before he even got into politics, he was already problematic.  Elon Musk completely disregarded China's state policy of [Civil-Military Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-civil_fusion); providing the CCP-PLA with technology funded by American taxpayers, which will inevitably be used against U.S.  F. Elon Musk should be a mantra.  He supports BRICS against our allied interests.  ....and now Tesla & SpaceX tech is in the new Dongfeng missile system.",Miao_Yin8964,2025-04-18T05:24:39,1
