"My take away from this article:  >To cope with the catastrophe of a second Trump administration and to counter the serial lying, we need to use every imaginable means of truth-telling. And the truth-telling itself becomes an expression of activist resistance.",neopolitan-wheem,2025-05-06T11:53:52,39
"Oklahoma is requiring schools to teach that Trump won in 2020. MAGA is a cult and my only real hope is that once he's dead, these people will snap out of it.

"It's something I've thought about a bit. If you look at America, we've embraced false or differing realities since our inception. We created a supposedly free country, but it was still based around slavery. Then we went along with false understandings of issues like race or about how the South's fight in the Civil War was actually virtuous or just. We've kind of had two different realities in the country at least since the Civil War, two different histories of the nation which are starkly at odds. We still have memorials and commemorations for a regime which tried to maintain a strict order of slavery and racial discrimination.  This also isn't the first time media has been so divided. It used to be newspapers were completely based on political leanings. You'd mostly read and stick to the paper which subscribed to your political party or beliefs, and often the papers would perpetuate completely false or made up stories just to rile up their readers. This sometimes led to violence or even wars overseas based on tenuous or wrong information.  I do wonder what the exact distinction is in our current time. Is it this just the continuation or culmination of conflicts we've been having since the country was founded? Is it amplified because of recent media trends? Are the different realities now even farther apart than before? It's something worth a lot of deep thinking.",Scarlettail,2025-05-06T12:14:20,10

"the false rality is that the election was decided by anything other than millions of democrats refusing to vote for a woman.  Repubs voted the same way the always vote, for the ticket.  and LESS of them voted than in 2020.  Let's just hope democrats can learn from something the second time it happens.",justaheatattack,2025-05-06T12:06:31,2
"This is why I try to cling to every scrap of truth and primary source I can think of. Even the recent ""gas is 1.98"" I went ham on searching, eventually discovering that WHOLESALE gas was actually $1.98 around the time he made the statement. Doesn't make a damn difference in reality. Trump doesn't seem to comprehend the difference between wholesale and retail, and 1.98 isn't even the cheapest it's been since was inaugurated, and it was cheaper or nearly the same in Nov/Dec 2024. So his number is no achievement. Just a number. But now I know the source.  When the ""transgender"" =/= ""transgenic"" discourse a few months back I was accused multiple times of being a Trump apologist because I pointed out that the studies the WH was citing had nothing to do with transgenic mice, but rather mice being subjected to various hormone treatments to see how sex hormones change various reactions. I was very clear that it's stupid af and their inability to see/want to see the greater value of an experiment is devastating. I just thought that if we're going to be champions of the truth we should, you know, BE champions of the truth. Even if the lie is funnier.",Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-05-06T12:23:59,20
They won't. Republican propaganda runs deep and none of this ends when Trump is gone.,Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-05-06T12:51:59,12

"Leading up to the 2024 election, right-wing groups engaged in a coordinated campaign to have minority voters purged from the rolls. A few million voters were disenfrachised this way, and another two million or so mail-in ballots (favored by Democratic voters) were not counted for spurious reasons. Voter suppression has long been a key strategy for Republicans, but Trump's little helpers dialed it up to eleven this time around.",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-06T13:33:35,10
"I disagree with this. I think the election was stolen. Trump has insinuated or even stated it more than once. We know of ballots thrown out. We know there was meddling. Musk himself said he'd be going to prison if they lost.   Democrats were so concerned about ""taking the high road"" after Jan 6th that nobody is freaking out about it. I think that was planned, too. Muddy the waters with bullshit so thatm when they do exactly what they claim Dems did, it would deter a counter movement to uncover the election meddling they planned for 2024.",vucubcame,2025-05-06T12:16:25,6
"That's just not true. It was decided by plenty of other things. Harris' gender may well have been a factor but it wasn't the only factor.  The Democrats engaged in their own denial of truth about what Israel was doing in Gaza. That put a lot of people off (particularly in swing states with large Muslim populations who traditionally vote Democrat) because *if you're focused primarily on that issue* which many people were at the time, it makes the Democrats look as bad as Trump in the lying stakes.  For the record, I am obviously a Democrat supporter (not a voter as not from the US) and obviously Kamala Harris winning would have been vastly preferable. But this is the point of the article! It's not just about Trump! AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS as a whole need to be more honest with their constituents. Otherwise you're making it a lie-off and the biggest most brazen liar will win, which will always be someone on the Right because they've had so much more practice.  Saying ""oh people didn't vote for them because of xyz that they couldn't control"" is a cop out. There were plenty of things President Biden, Kamala and the DNC could have done to be more truthful with the voting public and wrest narrative control and public trust back from Donald Trump. They didn't do those things. They didn't even try. They stuck to the old ways of fudging and making big speeches and hoping that if they kissed enough babies it would get them over the line.   The American people need to be honest with themselves about that or they'll never get out of this mess.",night_dude,2025-05-06T17:33:18,2
