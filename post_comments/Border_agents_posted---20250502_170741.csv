"> But when Campos attempted to visit her at TMC, DHS officers — who appeared to be with Customs and Border Protection — blocked the entrance to her hospital room, saying he needed a signed G-28 form identifying him as the woman's lawyer before he could see her, Campos told the Star.  > Campos had the form with him and just needed the woman's signature, but CBP officers said neither he, nor a hospital official, would be allowed to take the form to her so she could sign, he said.  That's some dystopian illegality. Can't let you see her if you don't have a form. You have the form, but you need a signature. They won't let you let her sign.

What a great country, thanks republicans, you guys are so smart and compassionate and filled with honor to split this young family apart. I am sure they will thank you for years to come!
