He’s really made a mess for himself. Lame duck because he’s getting primaries or losing his next election.,steepclimbs,2025-05-08T16:56:34,12
">Conspiratorial thinking; megalomania (for example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he declines most briefings and never reads memos); high highs and low lows; long, rambling, repetitive and self centered monologues; lying in ways that are painfully, awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room.     This reminds me of someone….",Kytyngurl2,2025-05-08T19:56:57,7
"He is physically and mentally unwell, he needs to step down. I don't think he's in reality anymore after that stroke",haroldthehampster,2025-05-08T18:47:54,7

"He's obviously struggling with his health and he needs to listen to any of the people that are recommending that he step down. But sometimes, when people are in the throes of acting like this, they aren't listening to any of the people that care about them.   It's a shame he had to go turncoat but it's probably just yet another characteristic of his mental health problems.",oldfrancis,2025-05-08T17:20:14,8
Hard to see how he could ever be alone considering all the voices in his head.,AaminMarritza,2025-05-08T16:53:53,7

"Less than 48 hours ago, the “abundance” dems, the Matt Yglesias types, the Biden supporters, the neoliberals and centrists were hailing this man as the future of the party.   He’s been saying “we should kill all Palestinians and then move onto Iran” for over a year. Apparently that wasn’t disqualifying, but banging his hand on a desk in a meeting is over the line.   Fucking incredibly stupid people suddenly clutching their pearls like everyone hasn’t been saying this man was terminally brain damaged for like 2 years.",West_Flounder2840,2025-05-08T19:37:52,1

"Sounds weird but he should form his own political party.  The Fett Party or something.  Get other politicians to wear hoodies and the support, even if it's just a little, will make him realize he's not really alone.  There's dozens of supporters.",dbag3o1,2025-05-08T17:20:16,-5

"The centrists are scattered right now and they’re trying to find a good Suit to get behind. I believe they’ll pick Pete Buttigieg next, and when he fails to gain momentum, the final battle will be with Andy Beshear. I’m a fan of Pritzker myself, I hope he charts a progressive path, and creates a political movement by combining with the AOC/Bernie wing to renew the party and kick out the incumbents.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-05-08T19:55:45,7
They should have put him in a psych ward or treatment faculity by now.,the_simurgh,2025-05-09T00:00:54,1
That’s what they have said about literally every centrist candidate they’ve run in the last 3 cycles.   “Surely they will move left!” Then they immediately pivot right.,West_Flounder2840,2025-05-08T20:19:25,1
"I would argue that Pritzker is not a centrist candidate, he’s strongly progressive, but he’s not a socialist.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-05-08T20:59:15,3
