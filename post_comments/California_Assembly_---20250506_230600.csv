"This is horribly written.   As I understand it, one could obtain permanent ownership of a 16 year old for sex and be charged with a misdemeanor.   Can someone please tell me the definition of the word “buy” in this story.   Thank you.",Feeling_Reindeer2599,2025-05-07T01:59:55,8
"Pay underaged for sex? How about f--k no? Not even if it was between two underaged persons.  FYI, in Finland you commit a crime if you pay (or even try to pay) for sex and the person is under 18. Even money doesn't have to change hands, but any kind of renumeration for ""service"" is enough. In the eyes of the law a person under 18 is still a child, even though the age of consent is 16.",SeoulFinn,2025-05-07T00:47:34,6

"Am I missing something? Seems like the new language going forward is a reasonable compromise that addresses the concerns of the people who were originally against the amendment.  They didn't just say ""never mind, we are in favor of it now"", they added more language that closed the loophole that we're worried about.",thrawtes,2025-05-07T06:47:44,5
"> Under current law, those who purchase 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds for sex could face either a misdemeanor or a felony. The older teens are required to prove they are victims of trafficking before the felony applies.  > Progressives worry the automatic felony could be used against 18-year-olds with younger minors whose parents might not approve if the relationship is LGBTQ or interracial.   [This article by Dan Walters](https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/clash-sex-crimes-california-democrats/) has more details:  > ...the issue was rejoined this year with a bill carried by Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a Sacramento Democrat who had been a sex crime prosecutor.  > Krell’s measure would eliminate the carveout for 16- and 17-year old victims but in a replay of the previous year, fellow Democrats on the Assembly Public Safety Committee struck that provision of the bill, leading to a public squabble on the Assembly floor last week.  > Republicans sought to restore the bill’s original purpose and Krell endorsed the effort, saying “We need to say, loud and clear, that if you’re under 18, a child, a minor … the person buying that person should be charged with a felony. It’s plain and simple, sex without consent — that’s rape.”  > She picked up vocal support from some other Democrats but Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas beat back the effort and punished Krell by taking her name off the bill and inserting a phrase declaring an intent to deal with the issue later.  > “No one in the room is OK with” minors being sold for sex, Rivas said. “This is a nuanced issue and conversation.”  > That, however, is not the end of it because Newsom once again entered the debate.   > “The law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same — as a felony, regardless of the intended victim’s age,” Newsom said in a statement. “Full stop.”",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-06T23:23:59,9
"I thought the same thing. The article truly is horribly written.  It's about prostitution. They want to make it a felony to pay for sex from a 16/17 year old. It's perfectly reasonable legislation. I'm sure there's plenty of laws on the books that make it a felony to buy **anyone**, let alone a minor for sex.",hookyboysb,2025-05-07T12:09:18,3

Good time to mention that it's important to support your local adoption center and stay away from puppy mills. Older dogs are trained and deserve a good home.",Zebo91,2025-05-07T03:53:43,2
