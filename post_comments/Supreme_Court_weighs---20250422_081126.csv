"Bunch of fucking sickos lying and going ""ohh I'm just so *concerned*... my *faith*... the children will be *confused*..."" like this isn't coming from a place of pure hatred and disgust for people who are in the wrong kind of love.

"This is no different than parents saying they don't want schools to have books with interracial couples.   That used to be preached as against some religions, and yet, interracial couples existed in public, so children certainly could be exposed to that in the real world.  Why do these snowflakes try so hard to shield their children from the real world?  Why must they instist on living in a fantasy land?",Metro42014,2025-04-22T08:20:35,24
"It is telling that both the mother and the lawyer describe the topic as heavy.  > ""They are in conflict with our faith. And I also think that's too **heavy** for our daughter,"" she said in an interview with NPR. ""These are topics that I'm just not ready to start on down the road with her.""  ... > ""Most people believe that their children should have a period of time when they don't have to deal with these kind of **heavier** topics,"" he said. ""It goes to their children's very identity, how they will form families, have children. The things that most people think are some of the most important decisions you'll make in your life.""  They've found a neutral word to explain their view.   The topic isn't icky, weird, or wrong. It's just too heavy for my precious baby. /s",BeigiBlork,2025-04-22T08:32:48,13
"It is entirely possible that this term SCOTUS will rule that 1) the state must fund religious education and 2) that religious people can effectively veto secular public school curriculum.  It's incredible how in my lifetime (in my 40s) we went from funding of private religious instruction being illegal to potentially being mandated, all while nothing about the Constitution has changed.",eskimospy212,2025-04-22T09:08:40,6
"In 2025, it’s fascinating that we’re still debating what a good/ideal curriculum is. Either we know what is it by now, or we throw in the towel and admit that there just is no such thing as an ideal curriculum.  I teach math. Luckily for me, the curriculum has not really changed for a couple thousand years and the average lawmaker is to scared of it to politicize it.   If I taught any other subject though, I’m sure there’s no bottom to the stupidity.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-04-22T08:31:10,6

"It’s up to the states! WTF at least school boards then, as they are (supposed to be) locally and democratically run. Like you or I could run for our local school boards.  This is essential for how education must exist in a democracy.   At least that’s what John Dewey says, who literally wrote THE book on “Democracy and education”. Seriously. That’s the name of the book.   It’s short and energizing, you know, if you’re into that sort of thing. I strongly believe Dewey’s ideals are what we need to return to in order to have the democracy we deserve.

"""Heavy"" is a weird word choice. These people seem to think same sex relationships are like a dark cloud weighing on our lives. They aren't. They're just as energized and potentially joyful as any other relationships.

"I’m going to address this discussion through the lens of school librarians. What’s not being pointed out in most of these conversations about what some parents consider “heavy” topics; these concerns can be alleviated by actual parenting. It’s not an educator’s job to specifically cater to every parent’s point of view. If their child brings home something they don’t like, they can tell the child why they don’t agree, discuss it with them and send them back for another book. That’s what’s called a “teachable moment” in families and education. When a parent says a topic is “too heavy” they mean they don’t want to address it or tell the child why. It’s shirking the responsibility of guiding a child through a changing and different world. I’m so sick of it. / End rant.",Bad_Lib155,2025-04-22T11:59:08,1
