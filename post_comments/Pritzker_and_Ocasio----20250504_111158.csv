"She's a multiple term congress member who worked in a bar.   She is also a university graduate with honors with majors in economics and international relations. She worked in a bar while doing community activism.   She is better qualified than many of her peers.  Republicans started mocking her as a bartender and it's disheartening to see the media buying into it. Fortunately, she's smart enough to own her work history",geni_eC,2025-05-04T11:24:40,68
If Pritzker had any real value in comparison to Ocasio-Cortez then APnews would not feel the need to call her a bartender instead of a multi-term congressional member. Makes me think this is all PR to play into the naivité of Americans.,Elegant_Ear_1363,2025-05-04T11:41:02,15
"I feel that support for Pritzker is definitely being pushed on us for acceptance, rather than it being grassroots. As they’re economically peers, it’s good that he’s calling out Trump, but we have more in common with AOC, lacks conflicts of interest, and she’s more clear where she stands in support of working people. In a Presidential run, Pritzker would be a half-measure. Pritzker would just be okay.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-04T11:52:00,11

"They are not pushing him on anyone. He seems well liked in Illinois and he made some speeches that people liked. Now, all the not-Republicans can use his help or they can refuse his help.

Pritzker was the other guy in the conversation on the wiretap that lead to the Blagoyevich conviction. He’s literally already been an unindicted coconspirator in a corruption trial.  He’s an undeniably bad choice for the party.,Gash_Stretchum,2025-05-05T01:08:43,2

FDR was extremely wealthy also. He ended up being so successful that Republicans have spent nearly a century trying to undo his legacy.  I am not a fan of extreme wealth either. And we also need to consider the character and values of the person in possession of it. I’d take Pritzker any day over a malignant narcissist man child like Musk or Trump.,AkronRonin,2025-05-04T11:30:31,14
This is not the way.  You judge people by the content of their character.  Pritzker genuinely does good things and is well liked by his constituents.  He may have benefitted in an unfair system being born into a wealthy family but he is not actively working to make it even less fair for everyone else.  The fact that he’s even amplifying voices like AOC should tell you that.  Allies are not always what you expect.  If you judge a book by their cover you’re no better than Trump or those like him.,ShrimpieAC,2025-05-04T13:27:24,5

"Wikipedia:  Ocasio-Cortez was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Sergio Ocasio-Roman and Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez). She has a younger brother named Gabriel. Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico. The family lived in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester until Ocasio-Cortez was five, when they moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights. She said her family raised enough money to buy a small home there so she could go to school, and that her mother worked as a house cleaner in the town.   According to the national women's history museum,  family was working class. Not impoverished but not wealthy.  Dad died from lung cancer in 2008.",geni_eC,2025-05-05T16:41:50,1

Theodore Roosevelt too. There was a time where even among the upper classes in America you would find a sense that they saw value to public service. You could also argue the Roosevelt’s wanted to reform America because the alternative was a full on Communist Revolution which would leave the rich with nothing.
