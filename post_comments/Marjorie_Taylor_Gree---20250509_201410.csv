Bummer. She would be easy to beat,Kind-City-2173,2025-05-09T20:19:19,332
Only election she can win is in backwood racist hillbilly counties. No way she would win if the entire state could vote.,Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-09T20:24:08,208
"Wow! That's a shocking admission on her part. She's afraid she would lose. She thinks she would probably lose.   That is cause for hope. The governor dropped out too. They're, effectively; conceding the Georgia senate race to the Democratic Party.    In freaking Georgia.",IllustriousEast4854,2025-05-09T20:37:50,169
She cannot win the senate seat,Gladius_Claude,2025-05-09T20:28:32,46
Not really up to her. It’s like saying you’re not going to a party you weren’t invited to.,Sick0fThisShit,2025-05-09T20:43:15,41
"It's been a rough day for us, but everything points to Republicans being terrified of the elections coming up. This is good, but also dangerous.",Rosebunse,2025-05-09T21:32:05,21
Maybe if trump was doing better in the polls she'd have a chance but his popularity is sinking like a rock and so would hers.,baby_budda,2025-05-09T20:34:42,18
"Lol she wouldn’t win. She only holds office because of the tiny, racist, idiotic Georgia district she represents.",Onlypaws_,2025-05-09T22:05:47,13
Smarter than I thought,Cluefuljewel,2025-05-09T20:27:04,12
I was hoping she would resign that Congress seat and lose the Senate race.,Iata_deal4sea,2025-05-09T21:56:05,13
She knows she would lose easily.,philafly7475,2025-05-09T21:05:39,10
I guess she realized she’s not very popular outside of her own district,YourDogsAllWet,2025-05-09T21:11:37,9
"Well, duh. Because Senators are voted in using the popular vote of the State. The only reason she's a Representative is because of gerrymandered districts in Georgia.",seattlemyth,2025-05-09T22:12:58,9
Ugh the fact that her district is right across the state line from me makes me wanna barf,shayna16,2025-05-09T20:43:26,7

She might be a stupid pig but even she knows she would get washed out in a landslide.,Chazhoosier,2025-05-09T22:03:51,5
Scared she’d get owned by the Libs!,Dreaders85,2025-05-10T01:37:27,3

"She just found out that the entire campaign against her would be about her blatant insider trading.  Plus, no one likes her, even the GOP",RealStitchyKat,2025-05-10T06:47:03,2
Noooo. She is would be great.  I guarantee she could lead the secret space laser committee. She should reconsider,Logikil96,2025-05-10T06:09:27,1
She already has a high-paying career option ahead. Look at all the openings at Fox Propaganda!,YallerDawg,2025-05-10T08:28:35,1

She is too classy for senate,Own-Resource221,2025-05-09T22:37:42,-8
I think this might be good news. 2 R candidates have said they can’t win the race already.,everyoneneedsaherro,2025-05-09T21:15:16,95
That’s what we said about Trump in 2015.  I’ll never say it again about anyone.,Sparklemagic2002,2025-05-10T06:22:43,5
"Awesome points. Thank you, didn't realize all that was going on.",Hollen88,2025-05-09T21:06:41,32
We all know the senate is an extremist liberal propaganda machine devised by Obama to make America weak again!,Epicritical,2025-05-09T21:38:09,16
It is very telling. Especially with the midterms coming up next year. Sounds like she saw the writing on the wall.,Dsarg_92,2025-05-10T01:11:01,5
I have also ruled out running for that senate seat.,sarcasticbaldguy,2025-05-09T23:20:50,8

"Kemp could win, he’s most likely just wanting to spend the time laying the ground work to run for President in 2028 rather than get caught up in a competitive senate race.",Megalomanizac,2025-05-09T21:19:33,38
Including Kemp. In a normal year he could probably win too.,Eric848448,2025-05-09T22:35:03,7

More like does what she’s told,swissarmychainsaw,2025-05-09T21:57:45,4
"Ehhhhh could, sure. Being a popular governor running for a new office in a bad year for your party? Meh. Lotta recent evidence to the contrary. Would agree he was their best shot, by quite a bit. Their House members are clowns. Not _not_ worried about it, but I like Ossoff’s chances.",Chester2707,2025-05-10T13:17:01,2
