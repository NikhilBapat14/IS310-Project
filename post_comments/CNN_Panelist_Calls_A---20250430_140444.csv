Kevin O'leary doesn't have US citizenship.  He exploits Americans for his own dreams,KingThar,2025-04-30T14:11:02,25

"O'Leary  > People come to America to achieve the American dream. She embodies the American nightmare.  Because [Ocasio-Cortez] doesn’t believe people should succeed in wealth.  This is a huge problem for her, she [AOC] does not support capitalism.  Abbey Philips:   > Everyone doesn’t view capitalism, or becoming extremely wealthy, as the pinnacle of the American dream.  There are many Americans who work really hard and their aspiration is not to become supremely wealthy.  It is to have strong family units, it is to have community, it is to have a sense of purpose, it is to contribute to their environment.  There are many Americans for whom just being filthy rich is not the American dream.  Yeah, O'Leary has no idea what it is that people want.  I just want to be able to do something that I feel has a purpose and when I get into my 60's have enough saved to enjoy my retirement.",code_archeologist,2025-04-30T14:19:35,13
"This was a very revealing exchange. I grew up in the 70s and my family was comfortable - 5 boys - two parents who worked for the state and federal. These were not high up the ladder jobs. My dad died when I was 12 - Social Security got me through a four year college. Our house was 3 bedrooms with a big back yard. We went on vacation every summer for two weeks in Cape Cod. This was a very achievable American Dream. This was America with a vibrant middle class. The American dream is not being a millionaire, it is freedom and security from want. Fuck people like Kevin O'Leary who make you think you have to be rich enough for him to accept you into the room.",THEBIGHUNGERDC,2025-04-30T14:23:53,10

I hear conservatives try to bring up Bernie’s net worth being around 3M all the time as some kinda gotcha too. Why is there no middle ground with these people?   I’ve never heard Bernie or AOC say anything about being against people having money and being rich. I’ve heard them say maybe guys like Elon Musk shouldn’t be able to amass more wealth than 50% of Americans combined. It’s the obscene wealth that is the issue. Having enough money to be able to buy the entire government is the issue. It should be considered a National Security issue to be able to do that. It puts the integrity of everything at risk,Green_Tomato_7444,2025-04-30T16:15:32,2

"**From reporter Kimberley Richards:**  “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary recently referred to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “the American nightmare” during a panel discussion on CNN that was centered on the topic of the American dream.  In a Friday segment of “NewsNight,” host Abby Phillip had asked O’Leary, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump’s policies, if the idea of Ocasio-Cortez possibly becoming the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee concerned him — considering the progressive New York congresswoman is a “populist” who speaks to issues facing working-class people.  O’Leary said that while he has a “tremendous amount of respect” for Ocasio-Cortez, the president of the U.S. has to “embody the American dream.”  “People come to America to achieve the American dream,” he said. “She embodies the American nightmare.” When pressed by Phillip to explain further, O’Leary said: “Because \[Ocasio-Cortez\] doesn’t believe people should succeed in wealth.”  “This is a huge problem for her,” he said about the representative who regularly speaks out against the corporate elite, the billionaire class and billionaire influence in politics.

"As others have mentioned O'Leary is not an American. He just plays one on TV. As a result he does not understand what the American Dream is at all.  Becoming a Billionaire or even just ultra wealthy has nothing to do with the American Dream. In fact they are directly at odds of the American Dream. Hoarding wealth is the American Nightmare.  The American Dream is the idea that anyone can succeed with hard work, no matter where they start in life. It is having enough to raise a family, own a home, a nice car and be able to afford vacations every so often. That is solid middle class. Not hoarding millions or billions.",MasterK999,2025-04-30T22:29:19,1
