Now the Democrats are suddenly surprised what an immature child Hogg is and has always been?,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T08:58:35,120
"Dude didn’t even last a whole ass quarter before the democrats decided that the policies he is pushing for, WHICH THEY THEMSELVES CREATED, is too much. The irony in this situation is impossibly high on a mathematic level. It feels SO GOOD to see these dimwits get a taste of their own medicine by the monster they themselves created.  I pray that this is a wake up call for them, that they’ve skewed too far. But unfortunately, that’s wishful thinking, for once you get in bed with true fascism, there’s no escape but destruction.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-24T08:44:05,69
They seem to have lost the ability to self-correct.  They won’t even consider that they were wrong about some things.,Key2158,2025-04-24T08:52:10,51
Democrats have zero self-awareness.,triggernaut,2025-04-24T09:37:13,28

"These Democratic critics say their fury at Hogg has grown amid what they see as his ill-conceived and insufficient efforts to make amends for his planned primary campaign — a campaign that, they say, threatens the DNC’s neutrality and its capacity to fight back against President Donald Trump.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T10:14:55,8

Those awkward moments when the dumb little sideshow that was never supposed to go anywhere ***is more popular than their party elites.***,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-24T11:12:16,9
"From todays Wall Street Journal: The Federal Election Commission reports that Mr. Hogg’s Leaders We Deserve PAC raised $11.9 million last election cycle. It spent $266,000 on federal campaigns and committees but $10.7 million on operating expenses, including Mr. Hogg’s salary as PAC president.",Brottar,2025-04-24T16:12:29,3
He wants to blow up the democratic party and change it to his liking. Sounds like a certain someone i might know...,agk927,2025-04-24T10:08:28,8
He's the next Bernie Sanders.. he'll be in politics forever.,Rockmann1,2025-04-24T11:38:12,2
"Sounds like he's learning that the time of people coddling and bowing to him because he was a teen activist are over. He's an adult now, and with it, comes reality, and consequences.",MetallicaRules5,2025-04-24T11:23:54,6
"It never made sense to me why they would elect him. He cares about only one issue, regardless of whether that issue is good or bad for the party. His job is supposed to be to get Democrats elected, but he doesn’t care about that. He’d rather help an unelectable candidate in a primary against an incumbent in a red or purple state, based on their gun control views.  He just doesn’t seem to grasp the relatively simple concept that an elected moderate Democrat is a whole lot better for his party than a gun control advocate who goes on to lose the general..",r777m,2025-04-24T12:43:39,2
Gone would be good. Except he’s helping conservatives so much….dilemma,melie776,2025-04-24T12:33:58,1
"My ex-wifes last name (maiden) was Hogg. Something about that last name makes people insufferable, immature, blowhard narcissists.",scully360,2025-04-24T12:03:59,0
"They’re going to hand us a win next year in the gubernatorial if they keep this up. I’d prefer Hogg stays, personally.",ITrCool,2025-04-24T09:52:18,46
"There is a bit more to it than that.  He's trying to fund a bunch of Democrat competition in elections where he deems the current Dem in charge is nothing but an ass in the seat, winning only because districts are ""vote blue at all costs"".  So basically a bunch of legacy democrat losers are getting anxious because they will have to suddenly defend their seat.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-24T13:18:46,14
"I wished that they made him the chair of the DNC, and not just Co-chair. Would’ve made them look just as stupid as him.",SnooDonuts3155,2025-04-24T09:40:39,25
Me too. He’s a Trojan Horse for Republicans inside the Democratic Party.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T12:20:32,16
But also Hogg’s idea of who to replace them with are younger even more far left like AOC types,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T16:10:33,6

"Good lol  These types of people are what is driving the 20% Democrat Favorability Rating that CNN keeps openly publishing, the more the merrier.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-24T16:12:10,10
Exactly. People like Hogg are oblivious to that.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T16:15:04,6
