She sounds like she would make a great president.,CloakOfElvenkind,2025-04-05T19:19:19,190
"Harris is awesome to thank everyone. And she mentioned working people, which is exactly on point. These protests are a threat to what a general strike will look like. This is a shot across the bow, and people are not going to bow down to project 2025, even if that crap becomes law. No way.",MGSFFVII,2025-04-05T16:54:56,169

The thing is I’ve been seeing posts about “where has she been?” Well she was telling you what the problem was going to be prior to election if he was elected and still some demographics were like  “nah you ain’t it”.,Whatheholler,2025-04-05T20:10:48,16

"Need to start upping the types of demonstrations, check out the French way of doing it by grounding all transport so no planes trains or ships . Then add farmers dumping manure in front of government buildings and finally blocking all access to Trump golf courses. If need be keep it up for a few months as a one day demo does nothing especially at weekends",OneDilligaf,2025-04-06T08:44:16,3
"They're trying to see what they can get away with the most they can. Now is the time to stand up, be loud and break through. I went to Fox News out of curiosity last night- scrolled down the front page. Not one article on the mass protests. (They had a story on it, there was a link when I googled it, but if you went to their main page, it wasn't mentioned. So if you didn't know it you weren't looking for it, it's hidden. Which is exactly what they want.)",jello-kittu,2025-04-06T09:51:21,3

This was their whole plan: eradicate the government and now you’re dependent on the magnanimity of billionaires and the church.

So that’s the plan - protests?  Besides making ourselves feel better what does that do?  We are getting creamed strategically.  Protests mean nothing in the long run if not connected to strategic and long range planning.  These protests are just the vapid hashtag activism all over again with its attendant ultimate irrelevance.,ShokWayve,2025-04-06T00:10:16,-3

"Exactly. People were complaining she wasn’t speaking up sooner, but let’s be real — her entire campaign warned us about what he would do and America didn’t care enough to prevent it.

"I think I’ve been conditioned quite well to not dabble in conspiracy thinking, but now… looking at the graphed out evidence showing the possibility of “vote flipping” I think you might be on to something.  I dunno anymore. It’s not like it would make a difference if it turned out to be true and we found out tomorrow. Nothing will change the occupancy of the Whitehouse.  I think all the nonstop GOP election denial during the Biden/Harris administration from 2020-2024 may have been a preparatory exercise. The right going absolutely bonkers claiming the election in 2020 was stolen may have been a way to actually steal the 2024 election.  Meaning, if they perpetrated actual fraud to win, it’s easy to just shut our conversations down and call us conspiracy theorists, claiming “you called all us MAGAs the election deniers then, yet the tables have turned. Who’s the election denier now, lib?”  Gah I hope that’s somewhat coherent. It’s way past my bedtime.",sardita,2025-04-06T02:10:36,10
