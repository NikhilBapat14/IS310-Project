"Jesus Christ. He won a tight election, and the gerrymandering, shady Republicans are acting like he strode into the throne room atop his mighty steed like an invading general. These are wildly unserious people wholly unequipped to run this country or face the challenges we face at this historic juncture.      They claim climate change ""isn't real"" and yet float or threaten the idea of annexing or invading Canada and Greenland rather than leading a global engineering campaign to mitigate disaster. Their cowardice and clownishness might be the most destructive thing in the history of civilization inasmuch as climate change is an extinction level problem. These fawning, idiotic enablers are complicit in this criminality, and voting for and pushing distracting legislation like this should be seen for what it is - criminal negligence and possibly even threats against humanity.

Food for thought, as stupid as MTG and Trump are...is the House really going to consider spending millions of dollars on bullshit?  The cost of implementing a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" would likely be significant, though no formal cost analysis of such a proposal exists since this isn't actually a real bill that's been seriously considered. If such a bill were implemented, costs would include:  Updating all federal maps, charts, and navigational materials (NOAA, Coast Guard, Department of Defense) Modifying all federal documents, websites, educational materials, and databases Administrative costs for implementation across multiple agencies Potential international coordination costs (as the Gulf borders multiple countries)  For context, when the U.S. Board on Geographic Names makes even minor name changes to geographic features, implementation costs can run into millions of dollars across government agencies.",SimmonsJK,2025-05-07T16:25:26,3
