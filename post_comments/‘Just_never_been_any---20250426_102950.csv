I mean technically Bill Clinton and Gore did something similar   Except they actually left office with a budget surplus that started paying down our debt and didn't try to unlawfully destroy whole Federal agencies,blues111,2025-04-26T10:37:29,24

"The government gives money, grants, subsidies to so much that holds the economy up. Elon doesn't care about any of the money holding up those in poverty, programs that help education, agriculture, weather science and this is a problem. All Elon cares about is what holds up the wealthy. We need to survive these next 4 years and then building back up will be possible again if we vote in the right group of people. We need to get rid of citizens united and kick the Oligarchy out.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-26T10:43:13,7
"lol ‚ÄúMusk initially boasted that he could cut $2 trillion from the nation‚Äôs roughly $6.8 trillion federal budget, which is more money than the federal government spends on defense, education, veterans‚Äô health combined. He walked back his goal in early January, saying that $1 trillion would be ‚Äúan epic outcome,‚Äù and reportedly seemed to lower the total to $150 billion for the coming fiscal year at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month‚Äù   Slight difference between those two numbers",fromouterspace1,2025-04-26T10:55:46,5
"Usually, in an acronym, ‚Äúof‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get a letter.  The FBI isn‚Äôt the FBOI. The DHS isn‚Äôt the DOHS.  Even the naming of his department was a scam meant to make money off his crypto.",YgramulTheMany,2025-04-26T11:36:43,3
"Government agencies are like a Jenga tower.¬†  If you carefully remove a few pieces, you can still have it remain standing and relative stable.¬†  But if you swing a bat at it, it will all crumble, and take a long time to repair.¬†  Of course, if you take a chain saw to it, it will never be the same.¬†",Belle_Requin,2025-04-26T14:29:57,5

Obama did the same thing with sequestration as Musk. https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequestration-cuts-will-be-indis/ and https://qz.com/175157/barack-obama-has-shrunk-the-us-federal-workforce-more-than-ronald-reagan,FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-26T15:33:20,2

"Okay let‚Äôs make sure to have some context on that one: Obama fed reduction was driven by the ‚Äò08 recession. Those articles are from ‚Äò13 and ‚Äò14 and by the time he left office in ‚Äò16 the fed had recovered and grown.   https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/07/what-the-data-says-about-federal-workers/   Those articles are from the lowest point before it turned around and grew until until basically now. Obama should get credit for restoring the fed workforce following the recession, but I guess we won‚Äôt mention that.  Trump has no valid reason to shrink the fed when the economy was growing, inflation was dropping, and unemployment was low. These false equivalencies are absolutely dumb or (more likely) arguments in bad faith",RocketPower5035,2025-04-26T20:34:43,2
