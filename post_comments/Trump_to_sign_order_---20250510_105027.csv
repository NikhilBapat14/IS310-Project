The corruptification of the US govt continues.  Where are all the adults on both sides of the aisle who know how bad this is?,velvet_funtime,2025-05-10T11:02:58,1
"From the article: “One such law has been used to prosecute executives for misbranded or adulterated food and drugs.”  Whew. I was worried it might have been something trivial, like widespread corruption or safety hazards.",ISeeYouNoThanks,2025-05-10T11:25:09,1

That is a very good question. The adults in the room need to step up. One branch of the government can check the other. In this case two branches should be strangling the third.  The founders of America would be sad to see this,dropkickninja,2025-05-10T11:10:07,1
"Congress is in a failed state. The obsequiousness of the Republicans should make Americans wretch. Yet, the deep red states are filled with mindless zombies who hate American values, while believing they are “true patriots”. They want to win more than they want righteous leaders.  If there are any actual patriots on the Republican side of the aisle, this might be their last chance to stand up before America is officially a failed democracy. Every elected official will be pushed aside, jailed, or offed as soon as this is a dictatorship.  What legal measures are left on the table? Is there some weird, dusty procedure that could be used to at least buy time?",industrial-complex,2025-05-10T11:55:39,1
