"First of all, David Fahrenthold is amazing, and I appreciate this detailed reporting here! The fact that billionaires trump and musk are cutting food for people who can't afford it -- as well as hurting small farms -- is sickening. They don't have a problem affording food, so they don't care about people who do have that problem. How exactly does letting more people go hungry make America great?  Also, I thought this part was interesting, about a farmer whose business has been hurt by the food bank cuts:  >He said he agreed with Mr. Trump’s desire to cut waste in the budget. But, in his view, this was not waste.  >“They don’t understand: ‘Hey, you’re cutting the backbone of America,’” Mr. Simon said. “If he knew what was exactly happening right now, I don’t think he would support that at all.”  So he's fine with other people losing their jobs or their businesses being negatively affected, but when *his* business was negatively affected, suddenly he's upset. 🙄  It's amazing how trump supporters who are hurt by trump's policies think that trump doesn't know what's going on and would stop it if he could. Lol. He doesn't care about you!!",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T10:16:59,6
Any food bank I ever donated to already did this so the donations lasted longer. I'm not sure this headline actually helps anything except the impression that food banks were 'living large' before.,darsynia,2025-04-28T06:45:00,-1
