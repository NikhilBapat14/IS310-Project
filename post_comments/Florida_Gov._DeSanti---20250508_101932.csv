Thank god we have the republicans to keep Florida safe. God bless President Trump for renaming the Gulf to the *Gulf of America*. It is now waaaaay to patriotic for any bitch ass hurricane to fuck with it.

"I've already commented, but this is too much..   >""We have a right to know what is being introduced into our atmosphere and what the potential ramifications are,"" added Sen.

""We must demand accountability and oversight to ensure that the pursuit of technological solutions do not overcome at the expense of our health, environment and our future.""   This is so laughably unintentionally correct. It is also hypocritical beyond belief coming from Republicans.   >""We are sending a powerful message to the nation and the world that we prioritize the health of our environment and the right of our citizens to clean, unmanipulated skies,""   But smoke stacks and coal rollers are totes ok.",accountabilitycounts,2025-05-08T10:56:04,4

"> Weather modification is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rainfall or snowfall, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply.  ---  >NOAA published a page addressing various ideas in regard to tropical cyclone manipulation.  >In 2007, ""How to stop a hurricane""[20] explored various ideas such as:  >    Using lasers to discharge lightning in storms which are likely to become hurricanes  >    Pouring liquid nitrogen onto the sea to deprive the hurricane of heat energy.  >    Creating soot to absorb sunlight and change air temperature and create convection currents in the outer wall.",box-cable,2025-05-08T10:24:00,-3
