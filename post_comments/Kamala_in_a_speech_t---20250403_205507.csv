"I was actually really optimistic all day. Then my wife and I voted, while avoiding social media and that toxicity. I was nervous as hell but again, optimistic. I'm in Cali, so I never doubted us.

"Yep. Then you had that stuff like this going on https://apnews.com/article/tina-peters-colorado-clerk-election-vote-fraud-b456ce4f80dc97f4b967eb6297311a51  Propaganda makes people much more desperate. I‚Äôm not a Dem or Conservative, (I just use common sense.) And it‚Äôs easy to see which side is more desperate and gullible in the current Political climate.  He told us who he was every day.

Funny that you said NC because that is where I live. I watched the votes come in and then slowly change over a few hours before I said fuck it.   Like 2016 all over again I was at least happy our state voted for the Dem Governor. Thank God because the 2020 choice was likely a bigger nut job than Trump.,DarkishFriend,2025-04-04T09:21:29,2

Correct. That's been part of this whole strategy from day one - make sure nobody can believe anything. Discredit media. Lie so much that you lose track of the lies.,Jiggidy00,2025-04-04T00:09:35,59
It's honestly one of Trump's rare brilliant plays (and I think a lot of people underestimate him routinely at their own peril) He spent the better part of 8 years telling everyone the elections were rigged while his opponents screamed until they were blue in the face that they weren't. The Dems even made a big part of their 2024 election campaign about how Donny wouldn't accept a loss but they would because they have faith in democracy. Then some 'concerning' election results do come in that benefit him and if those that spent the last 8 years telling him the elections aren't rigged suddenly say they are they lose all credibility to a very large percentage of people.,okram2k,2025-04-04T08:13:00,1
