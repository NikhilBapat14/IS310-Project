"Imagine being denied care not because it won’t help, but because it hurts someone’s feelings to provide it.",Kitchen_Bicycle4339,2025-05-02T05:39:23,20
"I was denied basic care once by a Catholic hospital for being trans.  Why do religions get a free pass to discriminate?  If they can deny me care for their beliefs, I should be able to opt out of my tax dollars supporting them. That seems only fair.",Cordddyyy,2025-05-02T05:54:46,16
"So if the doctor thinks the patient is evil and deserves to die, he can deny care to the patient.",30mil,2025-05-02T05:37:58,14
"So, hypothetically speaking, could doctors deny healthcare to corrupt politicians and the police on moral grounds? ",SpiritedEclair,2025-05-02T05:38:34,11
"Is this what happened to the ""fuck your feelings"" crowd? What about doctor's who think a stupid Tennessee law violates their oath as a doctor?",dropkickninja,2025-05-02T05:43:02,8
It seems to me that a person with a conscience wouldn’t deny healthcare to a person in need of it.,capaho,2025-05-02T06:09:17,7
Now liberal healthcare providers can deny care to MAGATs.,nwgdad,2025-05-02T08:05:44,4
Does this work both ways?  Can a doctor over step the law if their conscience is telling them too ?,the-real-col-klink,2025-05-02T06:18:51,2
"So we just need every health provider in Tennessee to start denying care to any registered Republican. You either support this or enabled it, so live with the consequences.",athornton79,2025-05-02T06:38:29,2
Sounds like a great way to get new CEO's.,Bad_Habit_Nun,2025-05-02T06:34:36,1
“My conscience wants all the money.”,AINonsense,2025-05-02T06:49:57,1
Good. My religion is FUCK MAGA so we can just not treat MAGAts and let them die off.,Elmer_Whip,2025-05-02T10:34:07,1
And another doctor will take care of the patient,N1A117,2025-05-02T07:19:01,-6
maybe but knowing trump he probably has a work around,saiyanscaris,2025-05-02T06:52:53,2
"They think everyone is trying to ""make them sin"" (by existing as a trans person, or maybe needing an abortion, reading books, not liking nascar, etc.) so they try to legislate themselves into a safe closet from where they can comment endlessly on their alleged superiority and control everything around them by making it uniform.   Honestly, if you trigger one of them around here with the right words (or simply wearing a mask), you can get a whole free show. Personal experience.",Impressive_Serve_982,2025-05-02T06:14:41,5
