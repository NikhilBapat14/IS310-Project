">“It’s the church leadership I was referring to when I invoked the Devil,” she went on. “Just so we’re clear, bishops, when I said ‘controlled by Satan,’ I wasn’t talking about the Catholic Church. I was talking about you.”  This really doesn't make any sense in the context of Roman Catholic teaching. Not that it's surprising she isn't making any sense.",PikachuStatue,2025-04-27T18:34:10,341

"I commented this elsewhere but it applies here and I added in the “controlled by satan”.  I keep repeating this because people need to be aware. This isn’t new and it’s been studied in social science for over 70 years. While social science is not infallible, it is definitely a recognized and well-established academic discipline.  The comparison of Trumps administration to Nazi Germany is simply implying his administration is exhibiting all the signs of a right-wing authoritarian regime.  All authoritarian regimes rise to power because of supporters. In this case, MAGA. The people who support authoritarianism do not do so because of political ideology but because of personality and psychological traits such as highly obedient to authority, hostile to deviance, and deeply invested in maintaining traditional values and social structures. These traits are often driven by a desire for stability, order, and conformity, with a strong aversion to change and a tendency to view societal outliers or threats with suspicion. While not all, most White evangelicals fit this description. Most definitely all white nationalists.  These people have existed throughout history. It’s how Hitler rose to power. Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko, Russia under Putin (Soviet Union under Stalin is a left-wing authoritarianism regime)  This current political climate is specifically to draw these people in. When MGT talks about Jewish space laser or Catholic bishops being controlled by satan and Lauren Bobart expresses her unwavering loyalty to DJT, the rest of us think it’s weird as fuck, regardless of political affiliation, but the message isn’t for us.  When supposedly 2a supporters suddenly think it’s okay for ICE to enter their homes warrantless, it’s simply because their belief is not their own but whatever their leaders tell them to believe. (Example Jan 6th and the multiple defendants who said “Trump said too”)  When the power-hungry, regardless of their political affiliations, overstep and silence dissent, it’s not just one group that will rebel. Both the left and the right, united by a shared desire for liberty and autonomy, will inevitably push back. They may disagree on many things, but the defense of democratic principles is something both sides value deeply. It’s a dangerous path to go down, but the political pendulum always swings back, often with far more force than those in power anticipate.  Then we can go back to arguing about social welfare programs, tax cuts and healthcare instead of Jewish space lasers, satanic catholic bishops and dog-eating immigrants.",Quirky_Fly_5452,2025-04-27T19:05:48,26

"I used to be devout until I started studying religion and read the Bible. Even after all that study, it wasn't until this year that I found out Southern Baptists view the Catholic Church as satanistic and see the Pope as an antichrist.   I found out about a month ago when I found an absolutely unhinged miniature comic book from a local SB church tucked under the handle of a gas pump. Aside from the hilarity of how outrageously corny and stupid it was, it spent several pages really driving home how evil Catholicism is.   After the Pope passed and I saw MTG's comments, it made more sense to me.

"So, you know how when someone you are close to has a stark difference of opinion about a certain topic or preference, and in the moment you feel a twinge of grief and almost anger at this person for disagreeing with you?  But then you come back to earth and realize that preference is subjective, and no experience is universal, and you grow as an adult who must exist in a world with an infinite variety of diverse viewpoints?      Authoritarians are people who never go through the second half of that process.  Everything in life which does not conform to their preference, or align with their experience becomes a passive attack on their character.  Rather than arriving at the conclusion that experience is subjective, they interpret divergent preferences or behaviors as someone saying ""you are wrong,"" and the stress of this constant, low-stakes conflict causes them to seek conformity above anything else.      Of course, *reality* is that there is no absolute conformity, so the more they seek it out, the more this cognitive dissonance builds.  Even when they are in their all-white neighborhood, with their all-white church, and their all-Republican book club, someone might not like their casserole, or thinks some sermon wasn't that great, and they are again, constantly confronted with this simple truth that experience is subjective.  But to learn that lesson would be to tear down the single driving force which has governed their entire life, so they eventually turn their animosity outwards.  Internally, their ""logic"" is literally ""if only liberals were not allowed to exist then Constance would have liked my casserole,"" because they have completely moved beyond any rationale logic.  And that's how an authoritarian is born.    This is literally where we are now.  Donald Trump is their collective casserole which breaks reality for them.  They have abandoned all outward pretenses that their behaviors are rationale to the point that the exact antecedent doesn't matter...  ""XYXX because liberals are allowed to exist"" is the only thought left.",obeytheturtles,2025-04-28T08:35:25,1

"The other denominations really aren't better at all when it comes to protecting children from predatory preachers besides that they aren't as centralized as the Catholic Church. That makes it more difficult to move pastors around who are accused of bad behavior in an organized way like we've seen with various Catholic Dioceses.    However, plenty of pastors at even independent, non-denominational churches get caught all the time doing similar things but they still often manage to get it covered up with the support of their local church community or move on to the next town to start over. That makes it a bit more difficult to get away with those things but doesn't exactly stop preachers who have strong support from the community and who would be happy to blame the victims instead. ",williamfbuckwheat,2025-04-27T20:44:32,7

"They reject the primacy of the Roman archbishop (post-Peter) as the head of the Church. And they think its been corrupted totally. Protestantism was needed to bring Christ back into the Church. Etc  Also, they think the relationship Catholics have with the Saints is idolatry.  Basically, its been 2000 years, and theyve been corrupted. In fairness, no Church looks like the early Church, things HAVE changed. Priests used to marry and have kids. A lot of theology around the Pope was developed later, by guys like Leo I. The theology around canonized saints was obviously not developed by Jesus himself.  Just a matter of if you think those changes are positive, natural extensions of Christ’s church over time as it grows in a changing world or if you think theyre corruption.  I do think Rome sucked, toxic culture, and as Christianity merged with the Roman Empire it became worse, and carried Roman toxicity to the rest of Western Europe. And that all happened after Peter. The Church became MUCH more entwined with the character of the Roman Empire, and the Pope inherited a lot of his Earthly authority in the region through his association with Roman power as Rome became mythologized in middle ages Europe   So yeah, I think the “Catholics are Satan” thing is nonsense, but I also think the RCC has changed enough that theres room to simultaneously respect Peter’s role in the Church and reject the modern RCC  I’m just answering and do not actually care at all, Catholics are delightful and everything changes and that doesnt have to be bad.",RickyNixon,2025-04-27T20:52:30,6

"The Roundhead leadership were hardcore Puritans and they established a Puritan military junta when they won the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1638-1651). Part of the reason the English Civil War even happened was because the Puritan parliamentarians believed King Charles I was a secret Catholic.  It was King James I rejecting most of the Puritan demands in the Hampton Court Conference (1604), and King Charles I’s embrace of Arminianism during his personal rule, that got most of the Puritans to rage quit and start fucking off to the Thirteen Colonies in 1620.",Eryrix,2025-04-28T03:30:04,7

"In America, some evangelical Christians don’t believe Catholics are Christian because they have a misunderstanding of what Catholicism even is.   My point is that Catholics were Christians before evangelical Christianity was a thing. So it is strange to me when evangelical Christians say things like the Catholic Church is controlled by Satan and that Catholics worship Mary and saints, not Jesus. This seems most commonly reinforced by Southern Baptists and Pentecostals.   It’s fine to argue that Catholicism has strayed so far from its original intent and they feel Protestantism is closer. I get that argument. But there are enough people in pockets of America, particularly the southern US, that fundamentally misunderstand what Catholicism even is, and that’s weird to me.",Ill-Vermicelli-1684,2025-04-28T09:08:49,1

"Dig deeper.  The following sounds kooky. It  (very unfortunately) isn't.  ---  It was a way for jerry Falwell to avoid paying taxes on his Evangelical religious universities. That and his friends.  Jerry was quoted as saying abortion rights were a good thing. (iirc it was because it helped cut down on poverty).  He and his friends had private Evangelical universities, likely as tax dodging tools, definitely as propaganda outfits.  They refused to admit black students.  Lots of lawsuits, court appeals, etc ensue because they are not integrated racially. Jerry Falwell lost and these universities were required to pay taxes.   --=  Jerry lost his godsdamned mind. Started the Moral Majority over this. He drew the Catholics in (they were the black sheep of Christianity and politics in the USA at the time. the first Catholic President was a huge deal.) as votes and canon fodder by bringing abortion as a political issue into his ”religious” platform.  This played a large part in getting Ronald Reagan elected in 1980. One of the earliest things Ronald did was issue an executive order mandating the IRS stop taxing Jerry's universities (as well as his friends' universities) for lack of racial integration.   This put religion in modern US politics, almost overnight. Then it festeredwhile the GOP tried to ride it.   You know the rest.",girlpockets,2025-04-27T23:28:56,2
