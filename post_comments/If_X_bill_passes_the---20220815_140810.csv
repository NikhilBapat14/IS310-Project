"A bill that is not enacted in a 2 year Congress dies when that Congress adjourns. It can be reintroduced with a new bill number though.  The issue is that the composition of the house changes 100% every 2 years, creating a “new” Congress, whereas the Senate changes 1/3 every 2 years, so you lose the votes that said yes/no when that Congress adjourns, necessitating a new vote in both houses.  For our purposes, that happens after the midterms (2023 change of Congress)",apatheticviews,2022-08-15T18:59:17,19
"In a different note, let’s say bill X1 passes the Senate. The house gets bill X1, makes some minor changes, and then passes it as bill X1.1. Bill X1.1 must pass the senate with no further modifications before the president can sign it. If the Senate modifies it again before passing (now bill X1.2), then the House must pass it w/o modifications before the president signs (and so on). The exact same version of the bill must pass the House and Senate during the same session of Congress to become law.",[deleted],2022-08-15T21:08:19,3
"Oh, thank you!   So, does this mean that any bills passed in the House before the midterms won't be able to be voted on in the new Senate, next year?  Does this mean that, for the sake of argument, if a party believes they will lose one of the chambers, they cannot simply leave a lot of bills pre-voted in the chamber they will lose?",Dr_Macunayme,2022-08-15T19:57:15,1
"Correct, any bills voted before January in House OR Senate dies on Jan 3, 2023 (end of 117th Congress).  It doesn’t matter whether they think they will win or lose the other House, the bill dies, and must be revoted on.  As an example, let’s say on Jan 2, the house passes “the awesome bill” unanimously and the senate is expected to pass it as well. Unfortunately the Senate gets food poisoning at the Congress cafeteria and is sick until Jan 4. There is NO change of seats in either the House or the senate (everyone won re-election). “The awesome bill” would still have to be re-voted on in the house AND the senate once congress is back in session",apatheticviews,2022-08-15T20:13:33,6
That is correct.,ShadeofIcarus,2022-08-15T20:13:59,1
"You realize there are currently over 8,700 bills that have been submitted in the House in this past Congress alone? Most bills don’t get voted on.",MrLegilimens,2022-08-16T06:22:04,1
"It's worth noting that this is true up until the bill is signed.   If both houses pass it and the president doesn't sign before the session ends, it's a ""pocket veto""  Notably used to stop a bill without going on the record about it.    One party can do something similar to kill a bill where they just never vote on it in the chamber they control without going on record opposing it.",ShadeofIcarus,2022-08-15T20:19:06,4
Which is honestly mind-blowing. I believe that the Senate should be forced to do a vote-a-rama for these low support bills to get them on record,Dr_Macunayme,2022-08-16T15:47:45,1
Absolutely.  This is where we get into parliamentary actions and congressional maneuvering. One example is using passed bills (and editing them 100% to something else).,apatheticviews,2022-08-15T20:31:15,1
"The Senate doesn't deal with the House. The Senate has submitted 4,779 bills this Congress. It is not the case that those 4,779 have a sibling House bill, nor that all House bills have a sibling Senate bill.  (Note: both numbers are strictly H.R. or S. (bills), not resolutions, joint resolutions, amendments, or concurrent resolutions).",MrLegilimens,2022-08-16T16:32:29,3
