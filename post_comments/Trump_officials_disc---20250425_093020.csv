The states most likely to get hit hard by Hurricanes also happen to be Republican controlled states.,ioncloud9,2025-04-25T09:32:17,29
"Hey, Florida. How you doin'? Still think voting for a guy who calls climate change a hoax was a good idea?",Simmery,2025-04-25T09:32:24,12
"Ok, this has to be some kind of grift. What is Trump going to demand from states in order to qualify for disaster assistance? A generous donation for some dodgy fund? Buying his memecoin? Or is he really that stupid to stiff his own supporters so openly? (We all know he stiffs them behind their backs, but this openly?) Or is he counting on Foxnews spinning it as the fault of the Democrats?",GrandAdmiralSnackbar,2025-04-25T09:36:30,8
"Trump Admin: raise taxes on everyone via tariffs.  Also Trump Admin: not use tax money to help anyone.   MAGA voters: Yes! I love more taxes and less services! China will pay the tariffs! Hey, why is everything at Wal-Mart more expensive?",black_flag_4ever,2025-04-25T09:44:00,6
What is the point in denying hurricane relief? Trump officials need to learn the definition of teamwork. At this point nobody should be supporting Trump and from what I hear he has Trump 2028 merchandise he is trying to sell.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-25T09:38:35,5
"If states want that money, they'll each have to send one gloved young lady to Trump.",30mil,2025-04-25T09:45:00,5

"First, they must make a sizable donation to the Trump Foundation or buy a substantial number of Trump meme coins.",Traditional-Win-3368,2025-04-25T09:42:41,2
"So, what happens when states start going bankrupt, from having to take on so many duties that the federal government used to help with? State taxes increase, municipal taxes increase, and poorer states start turning into ghost towns (no services, businesses leave, residents leave, etc...)",kh-38,2025-04-25T10:02:34,2
"if you follow along with his administration your state will get help, if it’s a blue state or a state rhat has defied his orders and demands they will not get assistance.watch this is predictable.",Little_Darryl,2025-04-25T13:22:12,1
“Trump officials discuss how many people need to die before they will help.”,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T18:19:14,1
"My belief is that if this occurs, there will be some carve out or exception for red states, similar to the subsidy that trump gave to farmers in his first term.",Kincherk,2025-04-25T09:58:51,1
"Yeah, this will only last until a red state where Trump likes the governor needs hurricane disaster assistance.",raistlin65,2025-04-25T10:21:43,0
Trump wants states to come to him and “negotiate” for disaster assistance.  Every single thing the federal government does is now an extortion opportunity for the man who just started his own bitcoin company for this very purpose…,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-25T09:55:13,19
I wonder what his position will be when Maralago is under water?,kh-38,2025-04-25T10:03:19,4
"Think of it more as a 'information campaign' from the Trump administration... Something along the lines of:    ""Thank you for your vote. We are done with you now""   Or,   ""Empty promises have never been so profitable.""",citizenjones,2025-04-25T11:22:26,1
"Dude just refused to provide disaster assistance to Arkansas, and the governor was his press secretary. So yes, he's already openly backstabbing his supporters.",InertiasCreep,2025-04-25T10:14:46,11
Every single thing the government does is an extortion opportunity for Trump.  Everything.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-25T09:56:36,6
"> Or is he really that stupid to stiff his own supporters so openly?  I think he's really on the edge. He's not confident yet that he can stay in office past 2028. When he believes he can, you can be sure he won't give a fuck about his supporters any more.",Simmery,2025-04-25T10:25:42,3
Exactly.  It’s called extortion.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-25T09:57:27,3
He is a king now and does not care.,Aretirednurse,2025-04-25T10:04:53,1
He just denied Arkansas’s relief requests.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-25T10:00:14,5
"Maybe, but after those tornadoes, he's currently refusing to send federal money to Arkansas, which is about as red as a state can get. It will be interesting to see if he caves or decides to double down.",kh-38,2025-04-25T10:09:19,3
Hasn’t helped the state of Indiana…I bet Trump is withholding that because of Pence.,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T18:20:29,2
Yeah thats pretty much it. He wants the latitude to give money to states that he likes or do things for him and withhold from those that oppose him.,ioncloud9,2025-04-25T09:59:40,7
Oh thats his kids' problem. It will be 50-60 years until thats a major issue.,ioncloud9,2025-04-25T10:13:17,4
"Don't forget, the governor's daddy is our ambassador to Israel.  Wonder what Mike Huckabee thinks about this situation?",Apprehensive-Cat330,2025-04-25T10:40:08,5
"Yeah, I see that. It's just that so many things the Trump regime does is a grift, I'm still looking for an angle here for him to make money off of this shit.",GrandAdmiralSnackbar,2025-04-25T10:44:33,2
There's a real possibility he may not stay in office beyond 2025.,crazybones,2025-04-25T11:03:20,2
"Yes but he has a habit of backtracking if he gets enough negative feedback from his base. If a very large disaster were to occur in a red state and he didn’t send help, he might get enough pushback to where he backtracks.",Kincherk,2025-04-25T10:04:27,1
