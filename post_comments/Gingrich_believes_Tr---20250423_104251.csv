Does anyone else think about the fact that Trump's crimes and that his catalogue of moral sins is worse than probably 90-95% of celebrities who are permanently cancelled/or taking a lot of heat online? There are people out there who will tell you with a straight face that Donald Trump is a better human being than Katy Perry. I think about this - a lot.,douglasfalk92,2025-04-23T10:47:06,10
I don't trust Gingrich to know anything at this point.,Constant_Affect7774,2025-04-23T10:48:28,8
"I mean, hasn't Trump explicitly said he's renew the tax cuts from his 1st term?   The cuts where 80% of the benefits go to the top 1%.",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T10:46:55,5

Anyone that believed this would happen is dumb. He’s clearly shown he only uses his base as useful idiot votes. His biggest accomplishment is convincing millions of morons that he’s a populist.,MatrimCauthon95,2025-04-23T10:56:01,3
"LOL, how is this a story?  Republicans are trying to cut medicaid and social security to give the rich tax cuts.  No shit they he isn't going to hike taxes on the wealthy, he's trying to turn us into an oligarchy completely.",demystifier,2025-04-23T10:49:17,4

It was never really on the table. The idea was just floated to give the image to the gullible that Trump gives a shit about the poors.,2-travel-is-2-live,2025-04-23T12:02:02,2

Newt Gengrich? Fuck that dude. He literally is one of the reasons we’re in all this nonsense.,Right_Ostrich4015,2025-04-23T14:21:59,1
"When has he ever even entertained the idea of a tax increase on the wealthy in the first place?  What am I missing?  The plan has always been cut, cut, cut taxes on the wealthy.  And raise them on the working class via tariffs, which amounts to something like a federal sales tax.",God_Hand_9764,2025-04-23T15:19:15,1
Gingrich is up to his neck in Russia and Trump. His thoughts and opinions do not represent us and never have. His entire career was built on the backs of people he can’t stand. Look it up. He is a vile and petty man.,Iinktolyn,2025-04-23T16:25:59,1
