"I'm not sure there's any clear evidence that, as a question of fact, certain thins are better left to the states.  At least not these days where communication and travel are fast, and information gathering is plentiful; certainly plenty of nations do just fine with national governments and without the kind of states that have any significant power of their own.  Decisions on whether to do so in the US are largely based on what's allowable under the existing constitution, rather than on what makes for better policy.  As well as what's practically doable based on the party compositions and political situations.  ie people may choose to push legislation at a certain level simply because they can do so at that level, and can't do so at another level.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-03T18:03:09,2
"Because the 10th Amendment is a thing that exists, everything not directly enumerated to the federal government in the Constitution.   The purpose of the general government is to perform functions that cannot be handled by the states alone. They should not feel free to take on new powers and scope beyond what was lawfully delegated to them just for the sake of implementing things at a top down level or efficiency.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-07-03T09:13:18,1
"Land use, zoning, and planning laws are probably better left to states and local governments. Education also makes sense just because if the DoE was in charge of all public schools and universities in America, that would make one of if not the largest department in the federal government, and it just seems hard to mange.",loselyconscious,2024-07-04T04:02:56,1
Donâ€™t lose sight that the national government was created by the states and not the other way around.  We are a republic of states.,AfraidResearcher6921,2024-10-13T14:46:37,1
