"> Overall, a 54 percent majority said that Mr. Trump was “exceeding the powers available to him,” including 16 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of independent voters.  Those numbers are depressingly low…",dannyb_prodigy,2025-04-25T15:16:48,24
"Rare. Those three numbers are almost exactly the way I would have estimated them--except I would have placed a higher number on ""chaotic.""",fxkatt,2025-04-25T14:51:44,8

"Waitaminute, NYT.  So, you're saying the Democrats who you refused to platform because they were ""overreacting"" were right about your sane-washing of fascism?  Have you gotten Maggie Haberman's take on this yet? What does the Hunter Biden Desk have to say about this finding?",Grandpa_No,2025-04-25T14:50:42,13

Republicans hate freedom so it isn’t shocking. They just want someone who forces everyone else to think like them,JoonYuh,2025-04-25T17:23:45,10

"Not at all accurate. They’ve been open and detailed about all the negative shit he’s done, and they’ve said so. The only place they haven’t is in comments on this subreddit. A lot of those articles have been posted here, even, but none of you have ever bothered to read them.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T16:52:47,-9
"Just because I express my opinion on a subreddit does not mean that my opinion is only relevant to that sub. My opinions come from the real world which includes witnessing years of NYT putting their thumb on the scales.  - The ""NYT Pitchbot"" wouldn't exist if there weren't a kernel of truth. (https://bsky.app/profile/nytpitchbot.bsky.social) - Maggie Haberman does exist and still does her access journalism schtick. - AG Sulzberger did, in fact, say he was pushing the Times towards mindless both sides content. (https://presswatchers.org/2024/03/why-is-new-york-times-campaign-coverage-so-bad-because-thats-what-the-publisher-wants/) - The Times did, in fact, have more headlines about ""buttery emails"" than Clinton policy (https://www.vox.com/2017/12/7/16747712/study-media-2016-election-clintons-emails) - The Times did fixate on Hunter Biden instead of, I dunno, the fascists. (https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hunter-biden) - If Mags weren't bad enough, David Sanger is also still employed at NYT (https://www.emptywheel.net/2024/07/10/the-lie-david-sanger-told-to-sustain-nyts-non-stop-campaign-against-joe-biden/) - The Times was an active participant, and possible originator, of the ""Biden is too old"" narrative.
