"He's right. An ideologically incoherent group of Democrats took the heat so that vulnerable members avoided angering the base. Seems like a fair reading of the situation.  Though it's still a weird reversal from all the votes (Laken Riley Act, Cabinet) before that they went along with, base be damned.  Regardless though Stewart being correct is another part of why people are so mad with Schumer and the Senate. Poor messaging, seemingly no strategy, little coordination with the House, it goes on. The fact that Schumer the day before hinted at drawing a harder line and risking a shutdown only to fold 24 hours later? And waited until then to begin articulating why this was the necessary? Stupefying.   Even if you think this was always the likely outcome the way it happened is leading to a lot of people feeling like Democrats either aren't taking them seriously and/or got rolled.",Seriousgyro,2025-03-25T01:39:52,236

"The basic problem is that if the Democrats had voted to shut down the US government, it would have been a disaster, both politically and actually.  I think Trump would love to shut down the US government, I'm sure Putin would love that. And any heat from Americans could easily be aimed at Democrats, since in fact it would have been them that shut down the government. Trump thrives on chaos, and shutting the government down is the ultimate chaos.  The whole idea of shutting down the government is absurd in my view. It should never happen for any reason. Nothing positive ever comes from a government shutdown.

">Will shielding vulnerable senators from a tough vote actually help them win re-election — or just delay the backlash? Could this strategy backfire and make more Democrats — not just the 2026 class — targets for primary challenges?  I think it depends on what the Democrat strategy is in the next several months. No one really knows what they can do to resist Trump in a meaningful way or a way that would reward Democrats political points. Without some coherent strategy, this will delay the backlash (aka Republican wins) and will not have much of a primary challenge (what are you going to run on when theres no coherent strategy in fighting Trump).   >or would Republicans do the same thing if the roles were reversed?

He was the only Republican in the House to vote against it.  https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1899577763981365297   Long story short, he said  the CR is pretty much just an extension of Biden's spending bill. He says it's giving the Democrats exactly what they want and the ""fighting"" in congress is fake and is just political theater. Massie claimed that Johnson likely already had a deal with enough Democratic senators to pass it, and he (correctly) predicted that within a few days of that video he recorded, Schumer would announce that he supports passing the CR, along with 9 other Dem senators.  Now, the fact that every Democrat up for re-election voted ""no"" shows that what the Dem politicians want is different than what their voter base wants.

I frankly have been finding it very tiresome and irksome that Jon Stewart acts as if he knows how the US Congress works just because he was able to use his celebrity to get Republicans to vote for an almost universally popular bill among the American people.  Paris Hilton probably far more knows how the US Congress works given the bill she got passed wasn't even a public problem until after she made the American public aware of 'The Problem Teen Industry'.  Emma Vigeland of The Majority Report is likely correct. US Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand have Wall Street and such campaign money and Wall Street didn't want a Government Shutdown.  And US Senator Schumer wanted to be able to sell his book and he somehow thought he could charm his way into the American people agreeing with his strategy and then he could go on his book tour.",beeemkcl,2025-03-25T04:35:41,-1

"A few days before Schumer announced he supported passing the CR, Rep Massie (only Republican in the house to vote against the CR) said that it is all top to bottom political theater. He said that the CR is essentially just a continuation of Biden's budget and gives the Democrats what they want. He said they're ""pretending"" to want to vote against the CR in order to stand up to Trump (which is what their voter base wants) but he correctly predicted that in a few days Schumer and 10 other senators would announce they're voting against the filibuster.  They specifically chose 10 not up for re-election. What is clear as day happening here is that what the Democrat higher ups want is very different than what the voter base wants.

Schumer explained his message. He clearly states in several interviews that a shutdown would’ve allowed Doge and Republicans to damage more government programs by deciding they weren’t valuable and to just not refunds them .  Plenty of programs already struggling from cuts would lose what funding they have left. And most importantly the courts the only system for fighting Trump would be shut down . That’s why he voted to stop the government shut down .It’s not his fault people can’t understand that message.  Democrats do tons of stuff that people take for granted or ignore. Biden was on the picket lines and supporting workers yet when it came time to vote tons of unions and union workers didn’t support Kamala. People complained about Democrats messaging and Republicans. Republicans messaging is easy because they lie and say simple solutions to complex problems. It’s easy for a lie as a simple message . While the democrats have to provide real solutions and plans not just catchy buzzwords .,AmazingAd5517,2025-03-26T11:32:38,1
I think Schumer had a good reason for avoiding the shutdown - judges need to be working to stop unconstitutional executive orders but he didn’t get that out till it looked like he folded. I think the suggestion they would all vote know was a threat to get the Gop to change things but they don’t have that Mob boss mentality that Trump has to just let it rip be damned. They definitely need to be sharper with messaging.,hereiswhatisay,2025-03-30T20:49:06,1

"I think maybe you lack an understanding of how this all works. Democrats demanded concessions from Republicans, and Republicans chose to call the Dems bluff, give them nothing, and put them in a completely unenviable position of either voting for a bill that they played no role in shaping, or shut down the government, which they would have been blamed for by many voters, and which would have strengthened Trump's hand to continue gutting the government. The only way they could have gotten a chance of getting any concessions at all is by shutting down the government, which would hurt millions of people, and wouldn't have had any guarantee whatsoever of actually getting them anything at all besides political blame and an even worse federal government.   So you are saying that they should have taken a huge political risk, with a guaranteed chance of hurting many vulnerable people, for the sake of some theoretical concessions that may or may not have ever happened. Can you really blame them for not choosing that path?  Additionally, I think many Democrats such as yourself are unaware of the fact that the Dems lost the 2024 election fair and square, and that losing elections has consequences.  Trump campaigned on doing exactly what he is now doing, and won. Did you whole-heartedly support Kamala Harris? Did you donate to her campaign, or the campaigns of any Democrats running for House or Senate? Did you engage in any real activism whatsoever? Because if you didn't do any of those things, you are one of the people who is partially responsible for putting us in the situation we are now in, and you don't really have any right to complain so bitterly about what is happening.   It bothers me that many of the same far-left activists who seemed to hate Kamala Harris and do everything they could to undermine her are now extremely mad because the Republicans are gutting the government, even though we already had all the available information to know that this outcome would occur if Harris lost. I hope you aren't one of those people!",nyckidd,2025-03-25T10:15:58,-6
"One of the biggest issues with the Democratic party, it's a protection racket that is highly deferential to seniority and those who blindly support leadership with no actual desire for meritocracy or impact.  Very little turnover in leadership other than occasionally shuffling around DNC chairs.  No accountability.  No willingness to debate in public (scared of appearing in disarray).  On top of Schumer and Jeffries keeping their roles despite being awful, Pelosi whipping to get Connolly the Oversite Chair role just to spite AOC is the absolute epitome of Democratic failures.

"That's exactly right. If you haven't been paying attention to the goings on in the federal civil service, you probably don't get why this was so dangerous. Basically, there was an Executive Order that ordered agencies to begin plans for ""large-scale reductions in force"" (civil service layoffs) and ordered that one of the priority groups for people to be laid off included ""all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations.""  Basically, POTUS said ""if you don't work during a shutdown, you should be fired."" A lot of people don't see anything wrong with that - if you're not important enough to work during a shutdown, you probably don't add value is the thought. But that's ignoring that who works and who doesn't isn't determined by whether what you do is important to the functioning of the government, it's about whether you're involved in the direct protection of life or federal property. The people who do food safety inspections don't work, while the guard at the FDA building does. ""Essential"" isn't ""critical,"" it basically just means you're there to make sure nobody burns the building down while everybody else is at home.  Oh, and the people who DO work? They don't get paid until the shutdown is over. So if a shutdown drags out for weeks, you've got people who are going to have to take a good hard look at resigning in order to take a job that actually pays.  So there's an EO that says ""target people who don't work during a shutdown to be fired."" And then there's a shutdown threat.

"> This is the most pathetic thing I've ever read.  Who is better on your issues? Dems or Republicans? The answer dictates your vote if you actually base your vote on issues. You can be upset with that as much as you want, but it's just a cold hard fact. I don't know if leftists cost us 2024 (evidence is weak), but they certainly cost us 2000 and 2016. Can you imagine what a different world we'd be living in right now if Al Gore and Hillary Clinton had been president, for all their flaws? No Iraq and possibly no Afghanistan. Maybe even no 9/11. Maybe some actual strides on climate change. A 7-2 liberal SCOTUS if not better, and all that entails (no Citizens United, no Dobbs, etc). No DOGE or any of the other outrages Trump has committed or has yet to commit. If Stein voters had gone for Hillary, she would've won and Republicans would've learned the lesson that they need to go back to reasonable candidates like Mitt Romney if they want to win.  Not all the blame can go to liberals. There are some people who are just lazy and sat things out. But liberals had the ability to stop *all* of this and they pissed it away on protest votes and whining that served no purpose and that no one will remember.  The funny thing is, if Dems were a lockstep coalition that could handily win against Republicans, that would actually give the left more leverage. It'd force Reps to moderate to win, which would make them more palatable to left-leaning voters, which would give them more leverage to demand concessions. Or Dems would have such a large advantage that leftists could reasonably demand a leftward shift in policy (after 50% + 1 vote you're just running up the score as far as the election goes).  But no. You have to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, every single time. Republicans keep winning because they are, somehow, smarter about this.
