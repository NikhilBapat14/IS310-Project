"Title isn’t super clear. It’s not that SSA is only seeking to recover 50% of the sum they overpaid a particular person. It’s that they had stated a policy of withholding 100% of people’s monthly benefits and putting that money toward the overpayment. Now they’re going to take half the monthly benefits until the overpayment is resolved.   For people on a fixed income, there’s no good way to handle this. It’s hard to figure out a repayment plan that doesn’t create hardship for these folks. Sounds like they can request a lower withholding rate at least, but withholding will range from inconvenient to disastrous depending on the case. At the same time, unless the overpayment is 100% SSA’s fault, it’s hard to justify letting people keep the mistakenly paid money.",Call-me-Maverick,2025-05-05T08:34:51,21

"They could set it far lower, maybe 10% or a dollar limit whichever is lower. From what has been made public these errors are due to SSA calculations.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-05T10:32:44,3
"Depends on the case, overpayments can be due to failure of the beneficiary to disclose other income or assets",Call-me-Maverick,2025-05-05T10:42:08,1
Wasn't 10% the policy before this administration?,drwhoovian,2025-05-05T10:51:48,1
