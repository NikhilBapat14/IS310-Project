"I haven't read the referenced report, but this ""rebuttal"" does a great job at  proving the report's points (the ones referenced in the article) regarding the ""rebuttal""'s author (or their work). If your best argument is I can't be ~~racist~~ antisemitic because I'm ~~black~~ Jewish, then you really are conflating academic work with identity politics, and you're doing nothing but harm to your (alleged) cause.  Instead of providing actual counter-claims, the author claims to be persecuted. This is par for the course for pseudo-scientists with their own grifts (anti-vaxers, snake oil salesmen, etc...). Not a good look.  Whatever your opinions on the topic might be, if you claim to have any sort of expertise on the matter, you shouldn't rely on such debate tactics because it does nothing to win over favour for your cause.",ItsTrueIHaveExcel,2025-05-10T13:33:30,1
"I'm guessing half of the downvotes are from zionists wanting to silence it, and half of the downvotes are from anti-zionists who did not read the article and only read the headline quickly and think this is pro-zionism.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-10T14:36:33,1
