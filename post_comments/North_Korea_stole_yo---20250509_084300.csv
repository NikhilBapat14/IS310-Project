I would imagine Russia would be doing the same thing but being more successful.,Xanderson,2025-05-09T08:56:44,2
"1) the people doing the hiring got what they paid for: crap. Might be more expensive to conduct an in person interview but that would cut down this risk substantially    2) while I kinda see how these traitors who cooperated here in the US may have felt like they had a winning lottery ticket, they could have cashed in just as much or more by just doing the right fucking thing by running to the feds when it started looking suspicious and volunteering to cooperate. It is not that fucking hard to do the right thing in this situation. Greed and idiocy are major vulnerabilities of the US.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-09T09:35:04,2

"Wired is really doing the ""They took er jerbs!"" to North Korea?  Its definitely not billionaires offshoring labor to cut costs. Who would ever fathom such a scenario???",OutLikeVapor,2025-05-09T13:39:08,1
"Except capitalism encourages these sorts of activities as ‚Äúcompetitive advantage‚Äù and ‚Äúthe cost of doing business‚Äù. Until there is real enforcement or the public ensures that real enforcement occurs with or without the legal system (Frank Herbert has a good short story about this), then nothing will change. The problem is we raised entire generations to love money and eschew community in favor of their hoard. Until the culture shifts and a little bit of elbow grease gets put into the issue‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs gonna keep happening. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Not advocating for anything but the definition of insanity and all that.",Aschrod1,2025-05-09T10:05:12,2
