"From Bloomberg News reporter [Erik Wasson](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AR59NaVzr6k/erik-wasson):  President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to increase tax rates on some of the wealthiest Americans as a way to offset other cuts in his signature economic package.  The president’s proposal calls for creating a new 39.6% tax bracket for individuals earning at least $2.5 million, or couples making $5 million, according to people familiar with the discussion.  The president made the request in a Wednesday phone call to House Speaker Mike Johnson. The president also reiterated his desire to eliminate the [carried interest tax break](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/real-estate-firms-push-to-preserve-carried-interest-tax-break) claimed by venture capital and private equity fund managers, one person said.  If Congress approves Trump’s plan for a 39.6% rate, that would bring the top bracket to a level not seen since before Trump’s 2017 tax cut. The current top rate for individuals is 37%.",bloomberg,2025-05-08T14:49:58,11
