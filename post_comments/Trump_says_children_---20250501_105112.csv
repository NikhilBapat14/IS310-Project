"I suppose this just applies to families who buy their children 30 dolls each, which is what he thinks is a normal American family, and not the families that struggle to provide one ""doll"" or no ""dolls"" because they can't afford them.

Welcome to the great depression 2025 style.  The way the economy is heading it will not just be a recession this will be much harder to get out of. Trump is a fool if he thinks he can bring back manufacturing in the blink of an eye. There is not the work force needed even to support the increase in manufacturing. There is not the capital resources to put up thousands of fully automated dark factories. This is all a crazy dream.  Thanks Donnie 2 dolls.,Nice-Lakes,2025-05-01T11:07:35,13

"Kind of funny hearing conservatives talk about how we need to break the addiction of consumerism, and how they are happy to own less stuff because it's better and healthier in the long run so it's well worth the short term pain and discomfort.
