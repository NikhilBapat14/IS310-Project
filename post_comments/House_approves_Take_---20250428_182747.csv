"Some highlights from:  [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/trump-calls-congress-pass-overbroad-take-it-down-act-so-he-can-use-it-censor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/trump-calls-congress-pass-overbroad-take-it-down-act-so-he-can-use-it-censor)  Hereâ€™s what Trump said to a joint session of Congress:Â   >The Senate just passed the Take It Down Actâ€¦. Once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. And Iâ€™m going to use that bill for myself too if you donâ€™t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.  The Take It Down Act is an overbroad, poorly drafted bill that would create a powerful system to pressure removal of internet posts, with essentially no safeguards. While the bill is meant to address a serious problemâ€”the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)â€”the notice-and-takedown system it creates is an open invitation for powerful people to pressure websites into removing content they dislike. There are no penalties for applying very broad, or even farcical definitions of what constitutes NCII, and then demanding that it be removed.Â   **This Bill Will Punish Critics, and The President Wants It Passed Right Now**  Congress should believe Trump when he says he would use the Take It Down Act simply because he's ""treated badly,"" despite the fact that this is not the intention of the bill. There is nothing in the law, as written, to stop anyoneâ€”especially those with significant resourcesâ€”from misusing the notice-and-takedown system to remove speech that criticizes them or that they disagree with.",neopolitan-wheem,2025-04-28T19:32:29,14

"Reminder that corporations are individuals for the purposes of law.  All they have to say is that an image ""caused harm"" or they did not consent, and 3rd-party creations can go out the window.

"Except it is already illegal. That doesn't really stop anything. There IS a problem with AI, but that is an issue on how AI is trained, which this bill DOES NOT address. This bill WILL NOT get rid of the AI capable of making porn of your loved ones, it only means you can threaten to sue if the content isn't removed. Of which most content is, by then. It is a two-month waiting period before you are allowed to sue.  The same is true of revenge porn. It is already illegal, the issue is a lack of moderation. But companies won't increase their moderation, that is too expensive. So they simply will crack down on EVERYTHING ELSE in an effort to not hire more content moderators.  So because it will do practically nothing to actually fix any issues actual people, other than measures already in place, other entities will instead begin using the other language of the law to crack down on anything they don't like, NSFW or otherwise. That is why I said the problem is less the bill itself, and more the other laws and systems of the USA, which allow for all kinds of abuse. In any other nation, this bill probably would actually help solve issues.  But this is the USA. And because our legal systems are garbage, it is going to do a lot less good than people hoped, and a lot more damage than intended.",ragingreaver,2025-04-28T20:17:00,3
