"It's not ""survival of the fittest"". It's Eugenics. Because he's a eugenicist.  People are going to die at the hands of a man who believes in tracking and breeding out traits he doesn't like in favour of breeding in traits he does like, because he does like. Couple that with the deportation program that the US is already executing, his statements on farm animal vaccinations, and his misinformed perspectives on fertility, particularly with males.  He doesn't believe that there's a problem with pollution, but resistance to pollution; not disease, but resistance to disease.  RFK Jr. doesn't see Americans as individual humans. He views them as livestock to be ""optimized"". Bonus: if you die old enough to bare productive offspring but *just* young enough, the social security problem solves itself.",CitySeekerTron,2025-05-06T12:22:49,42
"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:  “Do your own research,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advised parents considering vaccination for their children during an 80-minute televised interview with Dr. Phil last week. He offered the loaded directive with some of his go-to antivax falsehoods: common shots are neurotoxic, the measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is “leaky,” the MMR vaccine hasn’t been adequately tested. In the middle of a major U.S. measles outbreak, where three unvaccinated people have died — two of whom were children — Kennedy continues to downplay the virus and refuses to tell the truth about lifesaving vaccines.  The root system of his disinformation campaign is multibranching. In one of his own published books, Kennedy indicates that he does not believe in germ theory, instead subscribing to a version of the abandoned 19th century concept that the “miasma” is the source of disease. He has historically profited from his “vaccine skepticism.” And then, there’s something else: the taproot that reaches deepest into the American psyche and is echoed across the Trump administration’s policies.  “It’s very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy falsely said during a March Fox Nation interview. “We see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don’t have good nutrition or who don’t have a good exercise regime.” Coupled with his disturbing statements on autism and long-standing belief that vaccinations cause the condition, Kennedy is circling a dark idea: that the value of one’s life can be tabulated in accordance with diagnoses and preexisting conditions. Since his appointment as secretary of health and human services (HHS), he has pursued a brutal vision of American health that several experts liken to a sort of eugenics. Kennedy has made it clear that certain deaths are acceptable or even preferable to a world where every child is vaccinated.

"“Do your own research” is insane coming from a health official. To make it worse the average person isn’t equipped to understand scientific articles and studies. They probably don’t even know where to find them, leaving them watching YouTube videos and perusing Facebook posts.

"This is one of those things where you're not getting any clear answers by anyone.  Why does RFK Jr. do the things he does? So far, no article has ever bothered to mention that RFK Jr.'s antivax crusade started out with HPV vaccines, not with the MMR. Since the mid '90s working for a law firm closely affiliated with scientology, RFK Jr. filed in numerous damage claims of questionable quality, often tying together questionable evidential pieces, to build up a case and extort money from pharmaceutical enterprises by means of out-of-court settlements. It's lucrative and profitable, especially for the lawyer whose salary is tied to how many cases he or she can win. RFK. Jr's rise is fundamentally the result of an already broken justice system.  By 2005 he would move over to MMR vaccines and specifically target them. This was much more to be expected given the fact that the combo vaccine was only recently introduced, that there were already substantial rumors in the UK over the MMR vaccines causing seizures and developmental delays in kids (starting in 2001), and that, as such, the responsible pharmaceutical company was more vulnerable to false damage claims, also because of a lack of evidential data that would suggest the opposite of what the plaintiff would claim.  So, does RFK Jr. really believe in what he says? Given that his statements tend to be contradictory, I would suppose that his public persona is more in line with a lawyer trying to win a case no matter what it costs rather than some guy with a personal conviction.",ScientistFit6451,2025-05-06T15:36:43,2
