"Yep. Unhinged, off the rails, and a drunk. Too much of a mess of a human to read a teleprompter, but the best pick to lead the Dept of Defense. Lmfao. A true class act fuck up.",RJ5R,2025-04-24T11:54:47,5
"At this point it is easy for forget that other Republicans even exist.    Just to illustrate how completely Trump has Co-opted democratic powers and taken Fascistic power for himself - so far this year the Congress has passed only two bills and three joint resolutions - in four months.  They have totally abdicated their power to make laws.  While, Trump, in his first 90 days wrote 130 executive orders - orders which are not supposed to have the power of laws, but anyone who disobeys, is subject to having their funding cut, their jobs eliminated, their schools closed, their broadcast licenses revoked, or maybe they will just be disappeared to a prison cell in a foreign country without a trial?  Even the tariffs - on virtually every country in the world (except Russia of course) - those are not being done to balance trade.  If Trump wanted to balance trade he would not be sabotaging most of the U.S. primary sources of export income - like Tourism and selling world class educations to foreign students.  What Trump really wants the tariffs for is to force every major private corporation to bend the knee to him or be forced out of business when their competitors get tariff exemptions and they do not.  Makes me want to scream - some people still can not see what is happening.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-24T12:07:58,2
