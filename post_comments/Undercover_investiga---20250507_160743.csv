"At first glance I thought some group was upset over the birth control pill.   I was wrong…    “Live Action conducted an undercover investigation in which a woman posing as a 16-year-old minor called dozens of Planned Parenthood locations seeking ""gender-affirming care."" At least seven facilities told her they would prescribe cross-sex hormones at the first appointment”",cliffotn,2025-05-07T16:19:22,50
Anyone here surprised?  We’ve heard “this isn’t actually happening”.  We all knew it was a lie.  Leftist nuts don’t seem to care it’s happening. Or refuse to believe it is.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-07T17:36:30,33

Yep. Happened with the selling of aborted fetal tissues.   When that was found out to be true I stopped taking any of the “it’s health services” fake news seriously.,itsyagirlblondie,2025-05-07T19:16:44,11
