">The letter argues that schools, in the name of DEI, ""have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies.""  >""The Letter does not even define what a 'DEI program' is.""  >Tying a consequence so severe – the loss of federal funding – to a new and ill-defined set of policies and behaviors could have a chilling effect on schools, McCafferty warned.  >As an example, she imagined ""an elementary school teacher could seek to establish a class culture of equitable and inclusive treatment by asking her students to sign a collective pledge to follow the 'Golden Rule' for the entire school year. It is more than arguable that such a practice would come within the ocean-wide definition of DEI set forth above.""  >Or, how should the nation's history teachers approach America's fraught racial past, given the department's contention that talk of ""systemic and structural racism"" has ""toxically indoctrinated"" students?  >""Discussing the … enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, the Jim Crow south, the founding of the KKK, and the Tulsa Race Massacre—necessarily entails discussions of race and how race and perceptions toward different racial groups has shaped American history,"" McCafferty wrote.

"They simply want to rewrite US history, as fascists do, and the most effective way to do that is to frighten people into self-censorship. And that has more effect if the rules are kept vague",LookOverall,2025-04-27T05:21:55,5
Many of the lawyers that the Trump admin has brought in are shady and quite bad. So you get things like this. I also wonder if the remaining career lawyers in DOJ and other agencies feel inclined to push flawed motions to delay things.,SayingQuietPartLoud,2025-04-27T08:29:56,2

">""The Letter does not even define what a 'DEI program' is.""  That's the appeal of so many of his policies - it's whatever grievance you want it to be.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T03:17:19,16
"Howls of laughter. ""How dare you accuse us of systemic racism!"" Proceedes to invade a school and drag brown children out and send them overeas without their parents. What is wrong with these people? Are they even human? Are these the lizard people they keep accusing the other side of? They don't seem to behave like humans.",TheOgrrr,2025-04-27T04:12:00,3

"There's certainly several sides to being human.  I think selfishness vs  compassion for others even if you yourself aren't impacted divides the 2 parties.    Look at VP Vance who after converting to Catholicism had  the balls to tell the POPE what the Catholic religious ideal is,  insisting it wasn't compassion.    How soon before VP Vance's wife realizes many Christian Nationalists aren't fond of brown people.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T04:44:50,2
