"As if I couldn't hate him anymore!!   Snippet:  >PresidentÂ [Donald Trump](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/)Â has promised to impose moreÂ [tariffs](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/tariffs/), this time on the pills, injections, and treatments keeping millions of Americans alive and healthy.Â [Sixty-six percent](https://hpi.georgetown.edu/rxdrugs/)Â of adults in the United States take prescription drugs. Iâ€™m one of them.Â   >If and when these tariffs go into effect, the already criminal cost of my psoriatic arthritis medication â€” and everyone elseâ€™s medication â€” will go through the roof.  >Without health insurance, a monthly supply of Cosentyx costs around $8,000. Trump has indicated that his pharmaceutical tariffs will range from 50 to 200 percent. The meds that make it possible for me, and tens of thousands of Americans, to live a normal life without chronic pain could cost anywhere from $12,000 to $24,000 per month in the very near future.  >Itâ€™s not just biologics â€” the cost of antibiotics, acne treatments, weight loss drugs like Ozempic, inhalers, birth control, blood pressure pills, and more will skyrocket. **Keep in mind: Americans already**Â [**pay far higher prices**](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2024/02/01.html)Â **for drugs than people in other countries.**",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-06T15:52:28,58

"I'm on Armour Thyroid because synthetic thyroid medication messes with my liver. I was on synthroid for 6 months and my liver enzymes were through the roof and I was starting to jaundice. and it also felt like someone was pulling fishing line through my nerves. I was switched to the Armour Thyroid and the issue went away. it was tested a few years later when a new Endocrinologist didn't believe it was the cause, switched me back and within 2 weeks my liver enzymes were elevated again.  I've been wanting to try cytomel(liothyronine) but since the armour was working my endocrinologist didn't want to mess with it. The generics work but their quality control sucks so the dosing is inaccurate. but generics are what would get screwed the most out of this.  My thyroid has been absolutely F'ed my entire life. I went into a medexema coma at 19 (For the curious it's technically ""not"" A coma since you CAN be roused to consciousness but it is more like sleeping 20 hours a day and having multiple organ failure)  It's technically not the most expensive medication ever, it's ""only"" about $140 a month for me with a coupon. but I'm not exactly living a life of financial affluence. my concern isn't just the price but also getting access to the medication since I doubt supplies will last if generics skyrocket in price.
