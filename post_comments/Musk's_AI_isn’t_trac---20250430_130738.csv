Yep. It seems like they prioritize controlling the narrative over actually doing anything. Hence the laughable and ever changing list of the ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and ‚Äúwaste‚Äù they found. I bet they are firing based on political alignment.,Flimsy-Rooster-3467,2025-04-30T13:12:36,193

"There is zero chance Elon is ""leaving."" Publicly they'll say this to address the legality of having a permanent special employee, and to dispel any negative press. But he'll always have a hand in what's going on. He'll always be tied to the administration and their efforts to dismantle democracy.   Why would he give up a chair at one of the most powerful tables at the world and disassociate himself from the government if he has the ability to cut off investigations into himself, grant himself juicy contracts, crush dissent, monitor the opinions of federal employees against him, and inject his own personal opinions into the decisions that shape the government.  To believe that Musk would simply walk away from that to focus on business is being pretty wishful.",retrostaticshock,2025-04-30T17:40:43,10
