"Georgians, how popular is she in your state? Because she seems to think the majority supports her from her home ground",RequirementOk7678,2025-05-06T02:36:42,3
"I wish I could root for her entry assuming she will get destroyed, but I thought the republicans were shooting themselves in the foot in 16 when they nominated Trump.  MTG in the senate is nightmare fuel for everyone but Tommy Tuberville. He'd lose his position at the bottom of the barrel.",travio,2025-05-06T02:53:49,3
> Marjorie Taylor Greene will “give some thought”  There's a first time for everything.,InexorableCruller,2025-05-06T05:09:24,3
"She came in last out if 4 in a recent poll. Outside of her district, she universally despised ",Physical-Ad-3798,2025-05-06T04:13:12,2
How is Ossoff polling? Was wondering why Brian Kemp gave up on running for the seat but wasn’t sure if it was the Trump factor (loathed by Trump) or due to polling.,Former-Counter-9588,2025-05-06T04:15:46,2
"I think she's lost alot of support in general because her comments have offended religious groups etc.  While she still has those maga idiots votes, she will have a hard fight for a win overall.  ",arilupe,2025-05-06T05:23:20,1
"Yoo, I was about to comment that nickname 🤣",feelinuneasy1234,2025-05-06T03:13:16,1
"I don't think she can win a statewide election.  She couldn't win a house seat in metro Atlanta and then moved to the racist most vile and trumpy district she could find. If people turn out, she couldn't win a senate seat. ",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-06T05:19:36,7
What's the motivation for her to run for Senate and not stay where she is?,Swuzzlebubble,2025-05-06T04:12:49,4
My best friend lives in her district and according to him; the average voter there is exactly what you would expect and she has a seat in the house until she dies or retires. On a state wide election though... It's highly unlikely she would win.,Grey_0ne,2025-05-06T05:16:57,3
Not very popular.  A May 1 poll had Ossoff at +17 against her.,Cavane42,2025-05-06T06:09:19,1
"not from GA, but we saw what happened in NC when you try to run a Trump level crazy at the state level, even in a swing state that went for Trump. Mark Robinson got stomped, with trump *on the ballot*. GA is a different state, but MTG feels like she would be headed for a similar result against Ossoff.",NineFingerLogen,2025-05-06T07:02:46,1
She won't win.  But if she runs she has to give up her House seat.  I hope she does for the hilarity of it all.     Also Tuberville is apparently running for governor of Alabama.  ,Blueskyways,2025-05-06T03:11:36,4
"Kemp wants to run for president,  but if trump lives he'll try to run again and mess up the actual campaigns and fundraising for any other Republicans. ",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-06T05:21:29,1
