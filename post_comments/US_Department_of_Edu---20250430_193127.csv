I suggest Education Secretary McMahon spend a fact finding week in the Chicago Southside meeting and speaking to the citizens and students. Good Luck,Pixburghman,2025-04-30T19:47:53,34
"How far will americans let this racist presidency destroy their country ? What the fuck man, it ain’t even subtle. Removing the Tuskegee airman from history was already blood boiling, but this is ridiculously vile.  And I say this as a white man…. Disgusting and blatant racism!",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-30T19:44:08,48
That they have turned ‘Offices of Civil Rights enforcement’ into partisan weapons *against* civil rights is psychotic.,5minArgument,2025-04-30T19:54:40,19
"I’m convinced that for the next four years anything being done to help any underprivileged person will disappear. They don’t want to help people.

"Are there corresponding ""Asian Students Success Plan"", ""Hispanic Students Success Plan"", and ""Native American Students Success Plan""? These are all minority groups, so if there is a plan for Black students, shouldn't there be also a plan for other minority students?",xibeno9261,2025-04-30T23:24:49,-7
This is one thing I and most Americans agree with trump on.  They should have just had success plans for kids doing poorly in school.  That naturally would have involved more black kids anyway and then wouldn't have been racist.   Progressives only hurt the democrats continuing to argue about DEI cause the majority overwhelmingly do not support it. ,Hobobo2024,2025-04-30T22:36:25,-16

Well it has to come from the people who overwhelmingly voted for him by race. Those are the people that need to take action. 🤷‍♂️ black people voted the way they were supposed to. Most Hispanic and Latino voted the right way. ( a lot of them are included though). So who does that leave us with ?🤔  Edit: correction 60 % of Latin and Hispanic folks voted for that idiot,finitefuck,2025-04-30T22:53:10,2

"If you’re not being sarcastic, you must be one of those “All Lives Matter” types. And if that’s the case, you’re really not worth the time to have an actual conversation if you can’t get that “Black Student Success Plan” does not imply “Only Black Student Success Plan.”",garretj84,2025-04-30T20:23:08,14
"It's not, and they know it's not. But, and I say this as a Black man, it comes down to not wanting us to have anything specifically to ourselves. And that's the ironic part about all of this. Things like this program were created because Blacks and other minority groups were kept out or away from the opportunities white people received.  But somehow they say it's a problem that we create something that would help to put us on equal footing with them, meanwhile they ignore the very issues that caused programs like this to be created in the first place.",idkbruh653,2025-04-30T23:56:41,5
"Racism is the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another. That means that people of color can't be racist against their oppressors. It doesn't work that way.  Racism has never meant "" treating people of a certain color differently than people of other colors."" That can be a thing that racists do, but it's not the definition.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-30T20:31:58,6
They do not give a single shit about white civil rights.    They care about keeping kayfabe to give themselves permission to commit horrifying crimes. ,Total_Employ_9520,2025-04-30T22:10:08,4
"It is, by definition. I explain this in other comments under this same thread.   If you create programs based on race, then that's racist.  Because you're saying that this program is being created for this race. But what makes the race special enough to need the program? Why are they so specifically in need of a program that wouldn't need to exist for other students as well? Obviously there are plenty of races of people who may suffer under white supremacy. Yet why do we need to make this program for the Black folks? Also what about the Black folks who don't really suffer the same ways? African immigrants do fine in America. So why claim the program is for Black people? Why not make it about those affected by X or something like it. Otherwise you're saying there's something wrong with these people. Which there isn't.",pickledplumber,2025-05-01T09:17:29,-1
">Racism has never meant "" treating people of a certain color differently than people of other colors."" That can be a thing that racists do, but it's not the definition.  Let's open up a dictionary prior to 2015 and see if your definition exists in there.   There's a term that encapsulates exactly what you mean. Systemic Racism.  Trying to convolute basic definitions to allow racism is wrong.   Now I know Webster's does include your definition but they do it as an adjacent of the main definition   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism  The Cambridge dictionary has a different view  https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/racism   Collins  https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/racism",pickledplumber,2025-04-30T21:18:50,-9
"Well aside from all that racism you just essentially delved into, your whole argument omits one universal truth that makes all of this minutiae in the grand scheme of things anyway: there's no such thing as race.",idkbruh653,2025-05-02T00:27:17,1
The *real* racism is recognizing the existence of racism.   /s,brocht,2025-04-30T21:35:17,8
"So here are the definitions as listed from all three  pages:  >a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race; also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice   *  >policies, behaviors, rules, etc. that result in a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race:  >harmful or unfair things that people say, do, or think based on the belief that their own race makes them more intelligent, good, moral, etc. than people of other races:  >the belief that some races are better than others, or the unfair treatment of someone because of his or her race  *  >Racism is the belief that people of some races are inferior to others, and the behavior which is the result of this belief.  >belief in or doctrine asserting racial differences in character, intelligence, etc. and the superiority of one race over another or others: racist doctrine also, typically, seeks to maintain the supposed purity of a race or the races  >any program or practice of racial discrimination, segregation, etc., specif., such a program or practice that upholds the political or economic domination of one race over another or others   >feelings or actions of hatred and bigotry toward a person or persons because of their race  ... I feel like we can rule out superiority being the issue here, because a program to help Black kids is pretty obviously not a superiority issue. Is it the ""continued unfair advantage"" that you're worried about? You're worried that Black kids are unfairly advantaged in Chicago schools?   I stand by my assertion that the definition of racism is not about treating people differently. It's (according to these three sources) about superiority and unfair advantage.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-30T21:58:16,7

Recognizing it is not racist.,pickledplumber,2025-04-30T21:45:23,-7
"Well you can stand by the wrong definition all you like.   It's got nothing to do with superiority or any advantage. It's simply the belief that you believe that a certain race needs a certain program. Fundamentally that's what racism is. You could name the program "" in support of those affected by White supremacy"" and that would be fine. But when you say Black, you're catching all Black people in that net. Africans, Caribbeans, Panamanians and British Black people absolutely do not face the same disparities that African Americans do. Such broad arguments that deal with race are racism.",pickledplumber,2025-04-30T22:52:15,-3
"So you think the black student success program needs to go away for the benefit of black students. Real fucking humanitarian there. It keeps them from experiencing your favorite definition of racism, which is the one that completely misses the fucking point.",Honest_Ad_5568,2025-05-01T01:02:10,7
