"Comedian Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell continued her yearslong feud with President Donald Trump over the weekend, suggesting that Trump is in ‚Äúcognitive decline.‚Äù  Are you a Doctor Rosie? Why the delay in diagnosing Biden? Are you coming back from Ireland to fix this issue?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T21:00:20,8
Why does she care if she isn't here anymore? Isn't Trump why she left? STFU already.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-04T21:00:22,7
Liberals always look for any magic phrase that they think makes other people believe them.   They think the words cognitive decline from the Republicans affected the left and the Democrats. What they don't know is that that was the truth.,DreadPirateGriswold,2025-05-04T21:40:52,7

"It must be exhausting having to play mental gymnastics each and every waking moment. I cannot fathom how your political leaning is the only characteristic trait you have where it‚Äôs all you think and talk about and exist for. God forbid, you have a multitude of personality traits and hobbies and defining characteristics let alone the content of your character shining through above all else.   This is the problem. The Left aren‚Äôt willing to talk or engage with our neighbors or community members freely as they have stipulations. I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs simply no way to live.",Capital_Connection67,2025-05-05T00:48:06,2
