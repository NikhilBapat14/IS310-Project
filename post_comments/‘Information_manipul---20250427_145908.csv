"And this US attorney in question, the one attacking Wikipedia, Ed Martin, is a Russian operative. As is his advisor, Michael Caputo, along with the one who appointed both of them, Agent Krasnov.  >Caputo, who describes Trump’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, as akin to a “big brother” and mentor, has known the president since the 1980s. During that decade, he worked for the DC lobbying firm headed by Stone and Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Caputo’s career also took him abroad. A veteran, Caputo worked for a USAID-funded endeavor that consulted on the election process in Russia in the 1990s.
