"Nothing that a well-oiled, well-funded, propaganda machine and foreign disinformation campaign can't handle.  Noting also the Trump administration's relationship with media oligarchs and its historic suppression of independent journalism and the free press.

Oh, and as designed by the billionaire ""tech bros"" working in lock step with the Trump administration.  And I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the whole ""man-o-sphere"" movement that is programming young men with all kinds of self-victimizing delusions and nurturing a new breed of insecure, chauvinistic, ethnocentric misogynists who blame ""wokeness,"" women's independence and radical leftism for their ""crisis of masculinity.""",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-07T00:24:51,16

Nah, we had pretty solid turnout, but it felt like a solid third of the people voting had no actual opinion, or knew nothing about the candidates and were just flipping a coin.

"Meanwhile the real crisis of masculinity is that after generations of basically just having housewives as glorified servants more or less garunteed to them no matter how mediocre they really are they are now having to compete against a global market and against the women they were supposed to be given in a market that is based on intelligence and skills. Mediocre doesn’t cut it anymore. Being able to pull the level and make the machine go “boop” isn’t enough. Just checking off the box of “be male” isn’t enough to make sure they will get a wife, a house, or a career.   Which to be fair I am still pretty bitter about being told “go to college.

Their bills are higher, that cheap junk on Amazon is now $$$$ and 10% of their paycheck is going to be garnished for the college loans.   His actual mistake was ACTUALLY trying to enact his policies instead of saying he would and then failing to deliver. His first presidency was pretty lame and I think that’s because the people he kept around were grossly inept and not really interested in anything but their pocketbooks. This time he has a bunch of (still inept but in a different way) idealouges who have a mission to destroy and “rebuild” a new America. What happened to his kids?

Tell these people that Trump is not our boss - Americans are collectively HIS boss, we hired him to do a job for US, and if he's doing a shitty job, if he is incompetent, if he is not doing what the people want him to do, it's up to US to take our representatives and senators to the coals demanding that Trump be fired, regardless of whether those congresspeople are Republican or Democrat. If they refuse, same deal - we hired THEM to work for US, we can fire them in the next election if they refuse to do the job we hired them for.

"Agreed. After watching republicans lose the popular vote in the vast majority of recent presidential elections, I was under the misapprehension that most non/infrequent voters were democratic diamonds in the rough. That was wrong.   I also question whether increasing voter turnout for its own sake is something democrats should continue focusing on. I heard that democratic canvassers in Arizona actually drove up republican voter turnout.   I know there are asymmetries in the coalitions, but republicans seem to do better with less. They are focused on who their supporters are and deliver (if selectively and otherwise only rhetorically).   Democratic policy is largely shaped by special interest groups and donors, many of whom are at odds with each other and out of touch with mainstream views and the sensibilities of the general public. It would be interesting if the party could trade expanding the tent to desperately prop up an electorally fragile coalition for changing its values so that it naturally appeals to more Americans, but given party leadership I don’t see that happening any time soon.",fellow-fellow,2025-05-07T07:06:02,5

They don't see themselves on the same level as ""the left"" ...they view ""the left"" as lower, very much like a racist sees other races as inherently lower. Also, like a racist, they don't have much else to take pride in to justify the status they give themselves aside from their sole identity as Republicans.
