"What ""deportation setback""?   His deportation efforts haven't been set back at all.   A day does not go by when someone is not snatched off the street and shipped away without any due process.     The press and the Reddit community are both addicted to using the **rhetoric** of winning even though we are losing badly to this fascist.  Only when we stop using fake news rhetoric and start accepting the situation as it is will we be willing to take some actual **action**, instead of waving placards around and throwing empty words at the fascists .",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T09:31:55,57

"It’s not like they could afford healthcare here anyway. The system is broken, mostly because it is working as designed.",WaterChicken007,2025-04-27T13:11:28,2
All on paper. The deported are still there or on their way. Not one contempt of court preceeding. Not one arrest of a Trump team member. Nothing but paper.,williamgman,2025-04-27T10:41:22,10
"None, unless you count the six protests I've attended and the letters I've written to my Senators and Congresswoman   But **NB I don't count protests and letters as action** because they're just rhetorical gestures with no concrete effect, so I've taken no action.        And that's my point: all of us on Reddit are just foot soldiers.   The foot soldiers didn't plan the American Revolution - the leaders, like Washington did.    We will have no effective action until we have leaders leading it on a mass scale.   We have no such leaders.  AOC and Bernie just talk but the have no plan of action.   Who is our General Washington?",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T10:07:24,10
Voting was our first and best action. Now we are stuck convincing SOME of the 90 fucking million who DID NOT VOTE to do something. Many of us worked phone banks during 2024 to try and reach them. I called red state phone numbers that did not answer or hung up.    Now we are facing the final solution... the one where folks get hurt. When Fox News shows peaceful protests to their minions... they show weakness. They make fun of us on their shows.   So yes... keep protesting... keep on your representatives (mine are all blue)... But expect the coming protests to not be family freindly television.,williamgman,2025-04-27T10:38:10,3

"*Effective* protests are rarely rated PG-13. If you aren’t expecting to deal with tear gas, water cannons, K-9 units, and “less-than-lethal” rounds being fired at you, that’s a picnic you’re planning.",zernoc56,2025-04-27T12:34:59,2

What's your evidence that violent protests are effective?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T12:38:03,-1

"I’m not saying *violent* protests are more effective, I’m saying your protests are milquetoast nothingburgers unless the powers that be are *actively trying to stop it* by siccing the police on you. If the protests are actually serious, people who attend them will be making preparations to negate, counter, or outlast common crown dispersion tactics.",zernoc56,2025-04-27T12:49:32,3
The 1960's were full of them. But then... soon to be like now... It will come from those attacking the protestors. Selma comes to mind.,williamgman,2025-04-27T15:18:39,1
Then why did you try to claim we don’t deport citizens? Because it has actually happened multiple times very recently.,WaterChicken007,2025-04-27T13:19:28,2
Exactly. The violence almost always comes from the forces against the protest. Whether it's anti protestors... Or the police themselves.,williamgman,2025-04-27T15:20:25,2
"You really need to study your history more.   The makeup of the Congress was much more liberal in the 60's and early 70's than today.  The Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, the establishment of the EPA, etc.   Also during that time everybody saw the same news - the media wasn't fragmented the way it is now.   We had 3 million people last week and it got no coverage.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T16:03:14,0
"Well if we had a legitimate government we would not be deporting US citizens. Unfortunately, we are living under an illegitimate fascist government who kidnaps people",wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-27T13:36:13,2
My point is the violent protests were effective... Sadly. Fox News literally makes fun of the current protests. That reaches the minds of over 70 million viewers and readers.,williamgman,2025-04-27T16:48:07,1
"Remember, I lived through that time and participated in many protests then.  The violence was **counter**-productive.  The reason why change happened was the same reason the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the EPA all happened then - the Congress was much more liberal.   Not anymore.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T17:16:56,0
Then I rest my case. They are not paying attention to the protests. Our MSM is not covering them. Hopefully a few of those 90 million will finally vote the next time. The dems will vote dem. The republicans will still vote republican. So unless new voters show up... It's less than 2 million that will decide again. Till then... It sucks.,williamgman,2025-04-27T18:05:14,1
"There isn't any 'till then'.   The 2026 election will proceed the same as the March 1933 elections in Germany. The fascist regime will use a combination of legal techniques such as their current attacks on funding platforms such as Act Blue, legislation to limit the franchise such as the SAVE Act, along with plain old violence and intimidation, to make sure that the Democrats don't win back Congress.       Several people have questioned my motives. My motive is very simple. There are many people on Reddit who are still asleep and don't recognize that we've had a fascist takeover. So they still think that the stuff you could do in a regular democracy such as protest and vote will still work. They won't.   Only when we **all** face reality will we be able to come up with an effective, strong response.  ",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-27T20:28:45,2
"You are correct on all counts there. I vote with my wallet. If there's a conversation IRL with someone I'm meeting, there's a good chance I'm going to take the topic of discussion to this reality. We need to spread it.",williamgman,2025-04-27T21:38:57,1
