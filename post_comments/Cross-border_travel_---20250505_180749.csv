"We live in Seattle and visit BC pretty regularly. When we went up in mid-April, it was eerily quiet for our crossing in both directions at the normally very busy Peach Arch. It was like a ghost town.",aimless_ly,2025-05-05T18:14:23,12

"*Fewer than 100,000 passenger vehicles crossed south into Washington state from B.C. in April, down from over 200,000 in April 2024.*  What's happening down on the ground. Canadians mean it--and the meaner they are, the better.  Wake-up call.",fxkatt,2025-05-05T18:18:26,18
">The number of people crossing the border into Washington in April fell by more than half compared with the same period last year, according toÂ [data collected](https://www.cascadegatewaydata.com/Dashboard)Â by the B.C. Transportation Ministry and Washington stateâ€™s Department of Transportation.  Trump tariffs and threats to Canada result in stunning decline in cross border traffic for Washington State (and beyond).",lifeisahighway2023,2025-05-05T18:10:07,7

"Nine. Percent. Drop in hotel bookings.   If you don't know, hospitality is very often run on razor thin margins. This is an erupting volcano level of catastrophe. Hotels will be closing left and right by summertime, and many will be laying off staff to try to make ends meet and struggle through for a few months.   Lots and lots of restaurants, and of course the suppliers to them, rely on the tourism spend also.   Just this, with nothing else going on about tariffs or anything, just this is going to cause enormous spikes in unemployment. Should see it starting in the May numbers.",shoobe01,2025-05-06T18:35:22,2
"This is going to devastate summer tourism. Canadian resorts cannot survive on Canadian tourists alone, and more and more we are hearing from travellers from the US & beyond who are now afraid to come here because of these interactions with CBP, so theyâ€™re rebooking at resorts on the US side.   I said it when this all started - the collateral damage from this will end up being worse than the losses we endured during COVID. Most of us barely got through that. Our small businesses will not make it through this summer.",jl56649,2025-05-05T18:39:26,-2
I am in a tourism oriented state down south and the drop off in Canadian tourism is decimating the industry with significant layoffs occurring in Vegas especially.,lifeisahighway2023,2025-05-05T18:18:36,10
"Iâ€™m on the East Coast, and visited Montreal in the middle of April. It was the same way at the main Vermont border crossing. Traffic was way down.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-05T18:26:25,3
We go pretty regularly but haven't been up since all the tariff nonsense.  I'll be interested to see when I get up for the Richmond Night Market over the summer.,SweetCosmicPope,2025-05-05T18:31:16,1

I agree with your remarks.  Vegas saw about 12% decline in Feb and 8 to 9% in March.  Conventions long booked helped offset but the real tests are going to going forward.   What has occurred is already having negative employment ramifications - as you noted margins are slim and volumes are needed.  I don't see certain audiences coming back in the near future and if every month going forward we see 8-10% or larger declines it will be very impactful.  It is also not just a matter of volumes but who spends.  Foreign tourists from both Canada and Europe visit for the experience and have wallets prepared to support that goal.,lifeisahighway2023,2025-05-06T21:38:01,2
"I am sorry to hear that.  I do read that there is still a fair amount of US tourism to Canada.  Some of my fellow Americans are initially concerned about being ""tarred and feathered"" if they cross into Canada - guilt by association, but are reporting very positive experiences.    I subscribe to the National Park sub and there are many Americans posting currently about touring parks with the better known Canadian national parks often in the conversation.  What I think may be a big concern is failing personal finances here.  Millions of Americans are on the verge of bankruptcy - the wealth distribution in America is far more unequal than Canada which is why Canadians were revered as tourists - they spent whereas American tourists typically did not to the same degree.  We are also now getting some reports of our customs and border service running intimidation patrols on the personal custom lanes at crossing points into Canada.  It seemingly is an effort to intimidate Americans into staying in America by the Trump admin.  I have done hundreds of crossings over decades into Canada (if not thousands by now) to visit family and never once saw a CBP officer anywhere other than in the commercial lanes (inspecting trucks is a routine part of their daily work).  But in the last few days there are multiple reports of CBP in the personal traffic lanes.  Scary.",lifeisahighway2023,2025-05-05T23:02:26,3
