">He could have just coasted his entire term and let everything be.  Malignant narcissism is a hell of a personality disorder. He is an addict, and his drug of choice is other peoples emotions. He literally gets off on making people fight with each other, being worshiped, loved, laughed at, raged at. He makes his staff fight so he can revel in their conflict. He wants entire nations to beg him for mercy, and doesn't care how much it hurts Americans. In his mind, they are peons who exist to work for him anyway. He's the CEO of America and he can fire anyone he wants, so Americans should just do what he says. Other countries and the courts and Congress are just competing businesses.   He pisses people off because by making other people mad, he feels good. He insults Zelinskyy to his face, then cuts off aid and screams about being a CHESS MASTER because he wants to feel Zelinskyy despair for the sake of it.   He hates military conflict only to the extent that he can't control it (which is why some MAGA call him a peace president), but look at how he relishes at sending people to foreign gulags known for human rights abuses. Or how he constantly calls for the death penalty and keeps calling his political opponents treasonous. Or his desire to ethnically cleanse civilians from Gaza. Suffering and bloodshed is perfectly fine as long as he gets to cause it and claim credit for it, with zero chance of retaliation.  If you get mad at him in his presence, he sits back and smirks while folding his arms. He thinks in that moment ""I made this person mad, that makes me powerful"". It's the ultimate rush for him. The details are just nonsense. See when Pelosi called him out to his face and he posted the picture thinking it made him look strong. Or that G7 summit where he was smirking while Merkel was laying into him.  He almost enjoys it as much as when he can make everyone else in the room laugh at you. See the disabled reporter he mocked. And literally every person he comes up with a stupid nickname for.   Policy doesn't matter. The country doesn't matter. Just seeking the next target to get a rush from. ""A global pandemic?
