"MAGA is too personalist - it revolves entirely around Trump's cult of personality, and, like authoritarian regimes of the past, will struggle or collapse without him.   None of the grifting scumbags in his orbit: Musk (and shady Theil behind him), Vance, Miller, Vought, Speaker Johnson can possibly carry the abyssal flame of Trump. Trump is such a uniqely American void space that he is nothing and everything at the same time.   He is so narcissistic that his followers can simply apply whatever religiously orgiastic, fascistic, and weird fantasy they want on him, and he will snatch it up and incorporate it into the sales pitch in his characteristically incoherent way. Those other men have an ethos and a character that will eventually cause conflict within the cognitively dissonant consciousness that Trump elicits. I believe they hate MAGA adherents more than anyone, and they will not be able to stomach the oddity that is the MAGA movement rank-and-file.   Trump is too unique in his lack of identifiable character. There will not be a replacement for him. It might certainly get worse after he is gone, but I believe the MAGA fantasy America he leads will end with him.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T11:42:07,29
Don't disregard how serious this threat is. Vance and Thiel are part of a very elaborate and dark plan for the world.,someMeatballs,2025-05-02T12:58:40,13
"He called Trump ""morally reprehensible"" and a ""demagogue."" He said Trump had the potential to become ""America's Hitler."" He was outraged at Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric. He said he couldn't support Trump because Trump's rhetoric was too racist.   And then the possibility of becoming President was dangled in front of him and suddenly he's eagerly embracing every morally reprehensible, demagogic, racist and fascistic thing that Trump comes up with.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-02T11:50:12,7
"Yeah but he’s got the personality of a freshly molested futon, so I’m not as worried about him keeping the MAGA bullshit going.",Andovars_Ghost,2025-05-02T12:31:35,8

JD Vance is woke. The guyliner is extremely woke.,Decent-Ad-6170,2025-05-02T16:30:38,3
"In related news, men are shaving off their eye lashes in an attempt to look less like jd vance according to a recent article by cnn where they disturbingly describe mark zuckerberg as a tech bro ""jock"" in the same sentence of describing andrew tate as being masculine.

"As radical as J.D Vance's ideas are (no abortions, no contraceptives, deregulated health insurance markets, etc), at-least unlike Trump, Vance has no (or even negative) charisma, he isn't gonna be able to convince anyone. MAGA is only tolerating Vance, because, of Trump. Without Trump, Vance is just a lost little boy.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-02T15:10:09,2

"Exactly.  MAGA is a cult of personality centered on Trump.  No one else comes close to replicating Trump's personality.  The cult, likely built by Russian psyops, was tailored specifically to fit a one-of-a-kind asset: Trump.  Not any ideology, not any other person.  Trumpism and MAGA will not survive more than 2 years without him.  Trump will be forgotten the same way Reagan and W have been.",Caraes_Naur,2025-05-02T12:33:30,3
"This is why Republicans refuse to do or say anything strongly against him even though they have the power to, because he's their ticket and they know the whole thing collapses once he's gone, and they haven't yet changed the system enough where they no longer need him. I think that may be the reason even more than how scared they are of retaliation.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-02T17:49:29,1
"Vance is such a joke, I don't even take him serious, it's like go away little boy (towards Vance not you). All I picture is him rolling around on the floor like the idiot he is hugging and humping a couch cushion with his arms and legs until he passes out from exhaustion.  I admire whoever came up with this so called ""rumor"" (which I believe is true anyway). I wish I would came up with it.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-02T15:14:24,1
"People can consider me a ""conspiracy theorist"", but, I believe Usha and her children (not his) are paid actors/actresses to pose as ""his family"" and his true lover is Peter Thiel.  I highly suspect J.D Vance is closeted gay. Sure, some could say he's bisexual (bysectional), but, he obviously doesn't like women romantically/sexually or even platonically.  It also saves me the mental energy of figuring out how that incel even managed to find a woman (especially a classy, intelligent woman like Usha) willing to marry and procreate (three times) with him.  I even think RFK's grandson (the guy who seems ""obsessed"" with Usha) is her real husband and is also the biological father of her children. I believe Jack (RFK's grandson) and Usha live together while Peter Thiel and J.D Vance live together. I don't even believe Usha and JD live with each other.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-03T08:08:30,1
"He'll be to MAGA what L. Ron Hubbard is to Scientology. It'll still be there, be weird, be dangerous, but it will never fully be mainstream again like it is now with Trump.  That's not to say that it doesn't mutate into something worse. It just won't be something inherited the way people worry about with Vance. For Vance to inherit anything, his backers (Theil, Palantir, etc.) will have to unleash the panopticon they intend to deploy, start building their tech enclaves, and draw up an uneasy alliance with the Christian Nationalists that are also using Trump to remove the obstacle of the U.S. government from the world they intend to impose upon us.   Worse? Yes. But the energy and momentum they have with Trump will not be there. It'll be replaced by ugly, obvious repression that only the ultra wealthy can get behind. That's when the party ends and the grind - for every citizen, even those who think they are ""winning"" now - truly begins.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T11:57:26,18
"What you say is believable. Ironic that most people these days would be ok with being gay. I don’t care. Then again, after this administration?   Part of me is really sad to see shit like this go down because we got complacent with voting. I like history, I am degreed. Those like me have seen the writing on the wall for a while. At least since the Clinton impeachment and the early days of Rush, Newt, and the other unmentionables we’ve had to endure.   Another part of me is infuriated and I want to watch this mother burn to the ground. Beginning with how the south was never held accountable for being treasonous bastards. All the way up to the red states acting like the dog that bites your hand.    California, Washington, New York and Boston have the highest GDP than the next 2 countries combined.   At that point l, have to go do something else, can’t be this angry for too long without it beginning to affect your health.",Conscious_Problem924,2025-05-03T08:18:32,2
"I don't care whether or not Vance is gay (it doesn't effect my opinion towards him), but, it's him feeling the need to mask it. Just like I also don't care if he's a beta boy, but, it's hilarious when he tries to throw himself off like an ""alpha male"", it's like, kid (towards him, not you), rip the metaphorical mask off and be yourself, people might like/respect you more.  I get the impression J.D Vance is very uncomfortable in his own skin. While yes, I still think he's a baby obsessed creep, but, he obviously isn't a ""tough alpha male"".",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-04T04:51:42,1
