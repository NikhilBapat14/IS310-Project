"Hogg doesn’t know the Democratic Party establishment makes the rules and decisions, not the snot nosed kid who is in a meaningless party position that will never make decisions on anything. Most important, do not dare challenge the status quo.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T16:38:23,11
Lol...the dems haven't had a legit primary since WAY before this kid was ducking and weaving his way to notoriety.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-24T15:12:27,13
"So Hogg wants to primary older, successful incumbents using funds from the org he leads.  The DNC is saying no bueno dude, you’re either on board and will be unbiased or fuck off.    “But the DNC chair added that while he understands what Hogg is trying to do, ""I've said to him, if you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters. We can't be both the referee and also the player at the same time.""",cliffotn,2025-04-24T15:27:21,8
"lol, they’ve been the players, the referees and the owners of the stadium fleecing $7 beers and $200 parking off the fans for years. Every dirty finger in every dirty pie.",docholiday999,2025-04-24T17:27:11,10
