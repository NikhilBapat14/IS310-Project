"It was pretty sad yesterday to read his post yesterday (via other media than TS) about soldiers dying, totally ignorant of the fact that , hello, that was NEIGHBORHOOD. A woman came out of her house and the one next to hers was rubble.  Civilians are being targeted in Ukraine. But that's not a war crime anymore because all those people in the US who investigate them have been FIRED. Hesgeth wants to shoot protesters..  Obviously he is only worried about the Russian soldiers.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-25T06:47:02,3
