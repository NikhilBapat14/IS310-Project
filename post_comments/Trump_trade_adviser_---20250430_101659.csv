So if Trump's policies are driving domestic investment and Biden's policies are just driving up debt, shouldn't our Republican Congress and Trump get rid of Build Back Better and CHIPS?

One thing you cannot do is gaslight the American public about the economy.  Biden tried to tell us the economy was actually doing well but we knew better.  Trump is making the same mistake.,dbag3o1,2025-04-30T10:20:11,-3
