"I wonder how many shady deals we have with countries for them to agree to take people who aren't even from their country.   ""The Trump administration is planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, according to U.S. officials, another sharp escalation in a deportation program that has sparked widespread legal challenges and intense political debate.  The nationalities of the migrants were not immediately clear, but a flight to Libya carrying the deportees could leave as soon as Wednesday, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation.  The decision to send deportees to Libya was striking. The country is racked with conflict, and human rights groups have called conditions in its network of migrant detention centers “horrific” and “deplorable.”  The Libya operation falls in line with the Trump administration’s effort to not only deter migrants from trying to enter the country illegally but also to send a strong message to those in the country illegally that they can be deported to countries where they could face brutal conditions. Reuters earlier reported the possibility of a U.S. deportation flight to Libya.""",Lebarican22,2025-05-06T21:56:11,19

"Of course it was only gonna be a matter of time before he began shopping around the globe for the best deals on this sort of thing. If he could make such a deal with Bukele & just get away with it with no consequences, why stop there?    He'd be more than happy to make as many of these deals with warlords in African '$#!tholes' as he possibly can. At the rate he's going, by 2028 they'll be rounding up Black folks in chains, putting us on boats at gunpoint & sending us to Africa...& not even Liberia either. He's probably already looking at the worst places he can possibly find...like Somalia, Zambia or Zimbabwe for instance.",HansSolo69er,2025-05-07T07:13:48,4
