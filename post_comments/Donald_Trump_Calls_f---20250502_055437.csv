It’s a crazy thing. Democrats really only have one shot to take Trump down. As dire as the situation is I think an impeachment right now wouldn’t work. Republicans need to prepare their rhetoric and mostly prepare their constituents that Trump needs to be removed. As far as I understand there is no way for the Democrats to remove Trump from office without the help of republican representatives.  If the republican base is not prepared mentally by their leaders for an impeachment they will radicalize and pressure their representatives to stand firmly behind Trump which most of them already are.  At the same time the more time passes the seriousness of the constitutional crisis increases and the authoritarian grip tightens. This is why you can’t give fascists even an inch of space. Their game is almost impossible to win in a democratic way.,Metrostation984,2025-05-02T07:08:27,41

"If they actually impeach him and convict him, then next up to be president is the VP, and after him the speaker of the house. Neither of those guys are actually shining examples of humanity either.       I was looking at the overview of the impeachment clause in the constitution and it says they can impeach all of them at the same time? Is that correct?      ""Article II, Section 4:  The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""     ""The Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove the President, Vice President, and all federal civil officers for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. This tool was inherited from English practice, in which Parliament impeached and convicted ministers and favorites of the Crown in a struggle to rein in the Crown’s power.  Congress’s power of impeachment is an important check on the Executive and Judicial Branches, recognized by the Framers as a crucial tool for holding government officers accountable for violations of the law and abuses of power. Congress has most notably employed the impeachment tool against the President and federal judges, but all federal civil officers are subject to removal by impeachment. The Senate has also concluded (by majority vote) on various occasions that an official impeached while in office remains subject to trial, conviction, and imposition of the penalty of disqualification even after he or she leaves office. The practice of impeachment makes clear, however, that Members of Congress are not civil officers subject to impeachment and removal.  While judicial precedents inform the effective substantive meaning of various provisions of the Constitution, impeachment is at bottom a unique political process largely unchecked by the judiciary. While the meaning of treason and bribery is relatively clear, the scope of high crimes and misdemeanors lacks a formal definition and has been fleshed out over time, in a manner perhaps analogous to the common law, through the practice of impeachments in the United States Congress. The type of behavior that qualifies as impeachable conduct, and the circumstances in which impeachment is an appropriate remedy for such actions, are thus determined by, among other things, competing political interests, changing institutional relationships among the three branches of government, and legislators’ interaction with and accountability to the public. The weight of historical practice, rather than judicial precedent, is thus central to understanding the nature of impeachment in the United States.""

The stakes are really high *right now*. The more these things come out, even just from Democrats, chips away at Trump's sanity. He can't stand it and while I hate to tactic of goading him into doing something even more insane than he's doing now, it's a legitimate shot.   Put the articles out there repeatedly for every malfeasance and let the pressure mount from the growing number of displeased Republican voters. It's abundantly clear that GOP members of congress are content to just stand by and do nothing. Dems need to be causing a lot of noise and make their complacency a focus. I'm not naive to think the average Republican is going to swiftly turn on Trump but just letting things quietly chug along while Trump pulls this shit isn't an option anymore. We're weeks from genuine economic upheaval that will be tough for the average citizen to ignore. Dems need to be pointing at their GOP colleagues for letting that happen to put the pressure on.

"If things keep going at this rate and Trump has no opposition from Congress or SCOTUS, there won't be 4 years; he'll be president for life.  He's using Project 2025 the same way Hitler and Stalin rose to power. Hitler formed a cult following and took over Germany by dividing and conquering individual groups at first: immigrants, gays, trans, Jews... etc. Once him and the nazis gained a majority in parliament, Hitler pulled off a coup and made himself president for life.  Stalin was more manipulative. He was assigned a secretary role under Lenin, he used his office to hire loyal friends within the Russian government and after Lenin died; Stalin had the support of the military and used it to make his opposition disappear.  Trump idolizes dictators. He's given the military, but the US military swears an oath to protect the Constitution. They're technically not bound to serve Trump, but ICE is a different story. So, the only thing stopping Trump from crowning himself is Congress and SCOTUS. Congress is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. The Speaker of the House is a Trump sycophant who will try to strike down impeachment charges before they can be voted on. As for SCOTUS, they're in a 6-3 conservative Republican super majority. Their job is to secure the Constitution, but because 3 of them were picked by Trump, they were picked specifically to cover his ass.  If America falls, the blame is solely on Supreme Court Justice: John Roberts. On July 1, 2024, Roberts introduced reasons why the president should be immune from the law, SCOTUS debated whether or not a sitting or former president is immune from prosecution. They ruled in a 6-3 decision that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed as president within their core constitutional purview, at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their official responsibility, and no immunity for unofficial acts.  So, Trump is taking that ruling and milking it for all its worth.",EvilMoSauron,2025-05-02T14:20:13,2

I had just made the biggest gamble of my political career—a $1.7 million gamble—and it had paid off. Running for reelection to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from Missouri, I had successfully manipulated the Republican primary so that in the general election I would face the candidate I was most likely to beat. And this is how I had promised my daughters we would celebrate.  But first let me go back to the beginning.”   ….    “Yes, it was a three-way primary of equally viable candidates, but a subset of energized people with strong religious convictions and serious aversion to gay people, public schools, immigrants and reproductive choice could help elect someone like Akin.”   …  “So how could we maneuver Akin into the GOP driver’s seat?  Using the guidance of my campaign staff and consultants, we came up with the idea for a “dog whistle” ad, a message that was pitched in such a way that it would be heard only by a certain group of people. I told my team we needed to put Akin’s uber-conservative bona fides in an ad—and then, using reverse psychology, tell voters not to vote for him. And we needed to run the hell out of that ad.”  ….  “As it turned out, we spent more money for Todd Akin in the last two weeks of the primary than he spent on his whole primary campaign.”",TheCOINTELBRO,2025-05-02T08:45:19,-2

"I think one of the nost important things we could do as a country once we get to the otherside of this (if we do, jesus) is that a constitutional amendment needs to be created that makes the Department of Justice its own co-equal branch. That way you have:   - Congress who makes the laws and creates/allocates the budgets.  - The Judicial branch which interprets the laws and sets precedents, as well as rules which laws themselves are legal (as defined by the constitution).   - The Justice branch which enforces the laws (which would include the FBI, ICE, etc.)  - The Executive branch, which uses the congressional budgets to fund agencies, has veto power, pardon power (but allow congress oppurtunity to review maybe, to prevent the executive to just constantly churn out pardons, effectively granting immunity) and is responsible for national security (military, CIA, etc.) and diplomatic relations.   I think that would create a nice balance, as the justice branch wouldnt be controlled by a rogue executive, allowing them to maintain law enforcement officials to counter situations like this. I think it should be seperate from the judicial branch because I dont think its generally a good idea for both sides of the bench to be on the same side.   Unfortunately..... I dont know if itll ever happen, and in fairness, Im not an expert on goverments and politics, so I dunno if it really is a good idea or will cause its own issues but...",brutinator,2025-05-02T09:46:58,11

"The main issue I see with making them an independent branch is: who hires, appoints, or elects the head or heads of the branch?  If we want to maintain their accountability to the electorate in any way, we wind up creating yet another vector for polarization, either directly via election of the AG, or indirectly if we make this hypothetical fourth branch's head an appointee of some kind the way that the courts already are.  Without a massive change to our electoral system to go with it, we'll just have basically the same problem again down the road.  I think it would be better in a lot of ways to consolidate the various arresting and prosecuting authorities under the Judicial branch.  The biggest problem with the current system, other than the sheer amount of money that's been allowed to flow into elections, is that the courts only have the teeth that the other branches are willing to give them.  If the Executive doesn't want to obey a court order, and Congress doesn't want to impeach the executive for it, what can the courts do?

And unfortunately, that has been the case in the decades since.

"> Only Trumpers came out of nowhere in the swing states while Democrats ignored the POTUS vote evenly across counties  It is infinitely more likely - and in states with cast vote record access (AZ unfortunately isn't one of them, nor is NC) demonstrably provable - that that's the result of a bunch of Trump-Gallego voters (people who can't stomach voting for women period, veterans, Hispanics - 2 of the 3 strongest deltas were in Yuma and Santa Cruz) than it is ~150K Trump voters otherwise left their ballots blank and ~150K Dem. voters undervoted the presidential spot.   There were [3428011](https://apps.azsos.gov/election/2024/ge/canvass/20241105_GeneralCanvass_Signed.pdf) total ballots cast in AZ in 2024, and 3390161 total valid votes for President - that leaves room for only 37850 ballots with the Presidential race blank, even less if you include non-tallied write-ins (""Mickey Mouse""/""Kurt Warner""/""Jesus"") - of which there were [7159 in Maricopa alone](https://elections.maricopa.gov/asset/jcr:26aa3adb-bac8-424b-ae32-ea50e9e5577a/11-05-2024-1%20Final%20Official%20Summary%20Report.pdf), so probably ~11580 or so statewide. There is simply no mathematical room in the results for ~150K blank Pres./otherwise Dem. ballots.  For some other elections:  * [2012](https://imgur.com/5ybPAW0), where Obama underperformed Carmona in all but one county, and Romney overperformed Flake in every county  * [2018](https://imgur.com/WVQZXPX), where Sinema never underperformed Garcia and Ducey never underpeformed McSally in a county  * [2020, where Biden never overperformed Kelly in a county](https://imgur.com/tTucb0V)  * [2022, where Hobbs never overperformed Kelly in a county and Lake never underperformed Masters](https://imgur.com/S7PqTRj)  > and voted ~60% in favor of abortion access amendments  And voted by a comparable margin for de-facto SB1070 2.0 in Prop314 (1949529 votes in favor vs. 1770242 votes for Trump), despite previously narrowly passing in-state tuition for undocumented students in Prop308 back in 2022. Voters contain multitudes.  > This is exactly what experts last cycle said would be present if the GOP claims of vote flipping held any truth.  This is at best a sizable misread of what they were saying, or else they'd have proof positive in Maine, where Trump overperformed Collins in 0 counties and only 5 precincts in the entire state. Or take the Republican gubernatorial victories in New Hampshire (R+31.76) and Vermont (R+41.1) despite Trump losing both states (D+7.35 and D+35.42 respectively). Or locally (and more narrowly) Republicans outvoting Dems by ~9.3k votes in the US House elections in AZ that year, or the CorpComm elections going 2R-1D.  > unprecedented over-/under-vote margins to down-ballot races that ignore county demographics and trends.  They're not. The two downballot races I've seen mentioned in this regard are   * Governor, where adult film connoisseur and self-described Black Nazi Mark Robinson made Kari Lake seem sane and caused massive amounts of ticket splitting  * Attorney General, which last had a Republican win the office [in 1896](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeb_V._Walser), and where Dems fielded a photogenic Army veteran and former Congressman in [Jeff Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jackson_(politician\)). [Here](https://imgur.com/AJnR61h) is what the comparison between President and AG looked like in 2008, the last time Dems won both offices.

Here are the plots for [President vs. Agriculture Commissioner](https://imgur.com/2T6UOmk), [President vs. Treasurer](https://imgur.com/Q8SciOc), and [President vs. Labor Commissioner](https://imgur.com/0fNeOh5), all races where the Republican candidate got more than Trump did statewide.  And just like we know the total number of ballots cast in AZ, we know it in NC - [5723987](https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/05/2024&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0), with 2898423+2715375+24762+22125+18936+12099+6863+528+30=5699141 valid votes cast for President (again, not counting invalid write-ins).

"Oh yeah. However, it also presents an opportunity. All SCOTUS would have to do is revoke immunity for Trump specifically. Rule that Trump has no presidential immunity of any kind as a direct consequence of ignoring SCOTUS rulings. Either Trump arrested immediately for the many many crimes he's pulled, or he has to toe the line to avoid being arrested from then on, which he won't do. Regardless, revoking the immunity only for Trump would neuter Trump immediately and with no real effort on SCOTUS' part, and they've had grounds to do so for a while.     The problem with throwing out immunity entirely now is they'd just go back to presumed immunity which wouldn't help much because it's legally a mess. By ruling the Trump and only Trump loses all immunity that would make it explicit when a president does and does not have immunity. By doing so, SCOTUS would set up a precedent that yeah, presidents have immunity generally speaking, but they can lose that immunity, ALL forms of immunity if and when they abuse it.  This is something SCOTUS should be all for considering that gives them power, gives them a means to enforce their own rulings, stops bastards like Trump from exploiting immunity, give this country a way to get rid of corrupt presidents like Trump in the future without needing impeachment, and forces presidents in the future to watch their step or they lose immunity, especially if they openly defy SCOTUS.  At the same time such a ruling doesn't give SCOTUS the ability to just outright call for an innocent president to be arrested. Even if SCOTUS decided to remove the immunity of an innocent president ""just because"" the ruling wouldn't give SCOTUS the ability to arrest that president until said president actually does something illegal.

"Well he was certainly more calculated, ideological, and disciplined than Trump, and his speeches are a totally different style, but I disagree that the two figures are fundamentally different in how their charisma captures people with authoritarian tendencies.

The message is different, the delivery is different, and the kinds of people targeted for misattributed blame are slightly different, but the vibes are the thing that stays the same, and they're vibes of grievance and revanchism.  Hitler's speeches may have been crafted to achieve a specific effect, but that was also how he behaved in his personal interactions with others; long monologues and frequent ranting.

Hitler was considered a buffoon by most everyone except his fans throughout his political rise and consolidation of power.

FL got around 60% but didn't meet a threshold. We passed abortion access almost 2:1.  The police union backed Gallego, it's true, but is it much of a change from '20? I mean, in the Trump-Gallego bloc.  But what's funnier is that AZ's GOP registration lead was steady from '16-'20 before doubling to 300k in '24. And we got the numbers I expected in every race but one. (And a disturbingly high rate for an actual relatively harmless nonsense petition that might have had good intentions -- it was a protest vote for me, it was unadoptable anyway.)  But don't take my word for it, see LegalEagle on Ann Selzer. The last time she was notably wrong, Stephen Spoonamore was also blogging about election security.  Then there's Musk's swing states petition.

No one's making that assertion. If I've implied it somewhere, it was a mistake. It's a hypothetical pool of plausible voter information (or specifically, if the rumors of petition staffers saying ""we'll vote for you"" were true) that would be used in states without cast vote record access.

I have the most begrudging love for Doug Ducey, adorably captured above, but McSally was the MAGAt. I was sure the Never Trumpers would help carry this one, but just saying, they're also prime votes from a flipping angle.  I'm guilty of using the 150k registration change as a hook, but where were Arizonans? Democrats had to have voted for Trump too to get these numbers, right?  I'm not sure what you mean about blank presidential vote ballots. Maybe I'm using the wrong term for undervotes -- I don't mean drop-off or bullet ballots.  So the funny thing about Lake and Kelly is the McCain phenomenon, in my opinion, and I think it's had a blue shift which has sadly left Hobbs behind. She's imperfect, but if in some context I can respect Ducey for hanging up on Trump, I have to respect Hobbs for being reasonable, intelligent, and diligent throughout the Cyber Ninjas shenanigans.

It's not proof positive, but it would be present *(5m later edit: notably hopefully, in a high-ticket item like Congress or Gov)*. It wasn't when it was alleged in 2020, and it was totally ridiculous. The possibility of vote flipping still does look extremely strong to me, although the statistics about drop-off/bullet ballot votes in swing states say it better -- something like 3x the rate, with fairly interesting details.  I have questions about reading the charts you've linked, and I couldn't find their source through TinEye. Not huge questions, but I'm curious.  I may have used the word ""unprecedented"" when describing the margins, I don't know it to be true by magnitude or its uniformity -- but the uniformity is most of my direct numerial point (which I'm having trouble comparing), and the political trends are still part of it, although I'd be walking back the importance I've put on the gaps or uniformity if I knew I were wrong. The McCain moderates are still liked, and D-POTUSes have been popular in many AZ counties for a long time, probably in part for Native populations and national park issues.  I do know much less about NC, but I don't see the logic in it there either. It looks a lot like AZ, although I expected a redder treasurer race. So if Blacks or Muslims abstained, was it impactful anywhere there? Was anyone predicting this stuff?  I know that a lot of the gravity of my claim is in the new, post-J6 outpouring for Trump in particular, and that the postulated timed tabulator vote flipping hack would have had to flip votes from Democrats in order to limit its use of potential harvested voter information (creating even higher drop-offs/BBs).  I hear PA had more new Trump voters than new Republican registrations, and that turns out to be the tip of the iceberg about PA, but we haven't even got to the Shpilkin charts yet, and I need a break.

"So I've got a busy afternoon/evening ahead of me and may not have enough time to respond to everything in that post today - will loop back later. But very quickly:  > Maybe I'm using the wrong term for undervotes -- I don't mean drop-off or bullet ballots.  > No one's making that assertion. If I've implied it somewhere, it was a mistake.  Then what do you mean by ""Only Trumpers"" and ""Democrats ignored the POTUS vote""? Let's get terms defined out of the gate.  > I have questions about reading the charts you've linked, and I couldn't find their source through TinEye. Not huge questions, but I'm curious.  Manually cobbled them together in Google Sheets. If you want the source documents for the numbers from state/county websites I'd be happy to link them. For 2018/2020/2022 the percentages for AZ Sen/Gov/Pres should all be pullable from Wikipedia.  > and that turns out to be the tip of the iceberg about PA  Assuming you're talking about the ETA article, my thoughts on it are [here](https://archive.is/T9O63) and [here](https://archive.is/NA7Yx). In short the pattern they show out of Philly comes up routinely there in election after election, even ones Dems have won, and pre-2020 ones. Same goes for Allegheny and Erie, though I didn't attach graphs for them in the post. And the papers and links they reference as academic sourcing/backup actively go against what they're trying to claim.  I don't touch on the more technical machine hardware stuff there because it isn't my forte, but my entire life work (through my layoff back in January) has been on campaigns/with election data - most of it (up through Spring 2023) in AZ. Happy to discuss other such election results data claims, though it'll take a while to get other graphs in place.  EDIT: Gonna see what else I can respond to before I get tired.  > We didn't really see the sexism on the Democrat side  It's the group of Republicans - Trump voters who couldn't bring themselves to vote for a woman so they voted for a macho-presenting veteran - whom I was mainly talking about when I said that.  > The police union backed Gallego, it's true, but is it much of a change from '20? I mean, in the Trump-Gallego bloc.  I personally think the biggest thing that caused the growth of that bloc (which is somewhat different in composition than the Trump-Kelly bloc in 2020) is the fact that - in the midst of a political realignment where Hispanics as a whole are swinging away from Democrats compared to the Obama/Clinton years - Ruben had the last name Gallego and not Galton. Just like Quezada outran Mayes in some Yuma/Nogales/Douglas precincts despite doing far worse than her statewide, and how Contreras outran Sinema in a lot of heavily-Hispanic turf in 2018 despite doing 6 points worse statewide, so did Ruben with the certain chunk of voters who looked favorably on his last name.  Before I continue, you can find these stats visualized at [this site - DRA](https://davesredistricting.org/) - it's free to create an account. It was designed as a DIY redistricting site - and it's a very powerful tool in that regard - but it can also serve as a quick precinct results visualizer. Create an account, click ""Maps"" in the upper-middle menu bar, then ""New Map"". Choose the state you want displayed and click ""Apply"". Once the state appears, move over to the left, find the menu that says ""Precincts"", click on the dropdown menu next to ""Swing"", select the two elections you want to compare, and then hit apply. It should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/dwM6aYM). Feel free to toy around and visualize ticket splitting in various election combos.  > (And a disturbingly high rate for an actual relatively harmless nonsense petition that might have had good intentions -- it was a protest vote for me, it was unadoptable anyway.)  Is this about Prop314? Because the ACLU and most state Dem. leadership would strongly disagree about its nominal harmlessness - even if the main deportation clause of it is not currently enforced thanks to funding issues - and I highly doubt that anything the Republican majority in the legislature spits out is with ""good intentions"".   > But what's funnier is that AZ's GOP registration lead was steady from '16-'20 before doubling to 300k in '24. And we got the numbers I expected in every race but one.  Ok, leaving Prop314 aside...the remainder of the election was also not that good for Dems in AZ. In the wins column we've got:  * Gallego * Prop139 * Blocking various ballot proposals to make citizen ballot measures harder, ban RCV, nix judicial term limits, etc. * Flipped HD17  And in the losses column (excl. 314):  * Harris * Failed to flip CD1 (Schweikert) or CD6 (Ciscomani) * Failed to flip any competitive State Senate districts * Lost SD4, resulting in Republicans increasing their State Senate margin * Failed to flip any other competitive State House seat * Lost seats in HD4, HD13, and HD16 to Republicans, resulting in them increasing their State House margin * 3-0 Republican sweep of CorpComm * Bolick/King both retained * Failed to flip any Maricopa Board of Supervisors seats despite 2 being competitive * Lost the Maricopa County Sheriff to Republicans * Failed to win the Maricopa County Recorder despite facing Stop The Stealer Justin Heap * Failed to win any other countywide office in Maricopa  And then Nanos somehow came within a few hundred votes of losing Pima County Sheriff. That's not a good night downballot by any stretch of the term when you look at the full scope of things.  > Then there's Musk's swing states petition. I saw something earlier today about it chasing voters' information -- it took in about a million signatories nationwide.  This is not something that needed chasing, though. As someone who's worked for the Dems in one capacity or another up until January, both parties have that information on file already when they acquire voter rolls from county/state elections offices. And on top of that, both parties have aligned companies that throw a lot of time and effort into crunching numbers to predict the likelihood voters (and non-voter adults) do a whole bunch of things - support/oppose Harris, support/oppose Trump, vote early, vote at all, support/oppose abortion access, support/oppose gun control, support/oppose adding cops to the streets, and so on. It'd be trivially easy to pull a list of people unlikely to turnout but who would very likely vote R/D if they did with the data available.  What info Musk spent $100 per person acquiring (+ the $1M giveaways) - that Bob Smith at 123 Main St., phone number Blah, email Bleh, age 45 pledges to vote to protect the 1st and 2nd amendments - is something the Trump campaign could have acquired from one of several GOP data firms for far less than $100/per person, and may already have had on file given they'd already run this show twice.  My personal spitballing on this is that Musk was spending big bucks on that info solely for the optics of spending big bucks to help Trump get elected. Donald has pudding for brains, approaching him after a win with ""I worked so hard to help you get elected, now please let me and my college undergrad cronies dismantle the administrative state willy-nilly"" is a lot easier of a sell when he has these grand big spending ventures like paying people $100 per petition signature or a $1M raffle, even if it's the campaign equivalent of a country paying a bunch of people to dig holes and then fill them back up. Musk and Trump were not on good terms just a couple of years back, so this public show of fealty (and whatever he privately told him he magically did in the race) was a necessary step to get back in Donald's good graces.  >  It's a hypothetical pool of plausible voter information (or specifically, if the rumors of petition staffers saying ""we'll vote for you"" were true) that would be used in states without cast vote record access.  Except they ran petitions both in swing states with publicly accessible CVRs (like Nevada/Wisconsin) and in those where with enough willpower and public records requests you could probably acquire them (like Arizona). Nevermind that I don't know what purpose the CVR being public/not public would serve here.  > Democrats had to have voted for Trump too to get these numbers, right?  Probably a handful did. [It was 3% in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/arizona) and between [2-4% in 2022 in AZ](https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls/arizona/general/governor/0) depending on the statewide race. But I assume most of the swings were driven (at least re. party registration) among registered Independents, who make up a bit over a third of the state. [Biden had to carry them by 9 points just to barely win in 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Arizona#Exit_polls).   > notably hopefully, in a high-ticket item like Congress or Gov). It wasn't when it was alleged in 2020, and it was totally ridiculous  ...I gave 3 examples where big-ticket downballot races in Dem. states (Gov. NH/Gov. VT/Sen. ME) went to Republicans despite Biden winning those states?   * 4 if you count the GOP [narrowly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Arizona) winning the combined US House vote in AZ despite Biden winning the state.  * 5 if you count Wisconsin, where GOP Congressional candidates in total got [51K more votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Wisconsin) than [Trump did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Wisconsin), while Dem. candidates got 64K less than Biden.

Only the former can be discerned without CVR access. And the chart you're likely talking about is one I cover in the two links I posted about their PA article, which actively cherry picks races - excluding Senate races in non-swing states with big ""dropoffs"" like VA/NE/MN (that's just on the Dem.-favorable side), and also including a gubernatorial race in their swing state column while excluding gubernatorial ones from their non-swing column.  And do you have any links where you saw ""experts last cycle"" claiming divergences in downballot results are proof of fraud and not just ticket-splitting?  > D-POTUSes have been popular in many AZ counties  This isn't all that important to the broader point, but...many? We've got Coconino, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Apache as habitual Dem. counties since 2000. Maricopa in 2020. They haven't won any other counties since Clinton in the 90's - and that was an entirely different party coalition in the state. Those voters in Pinal/La Paz/Gila/Greenlee are either dead or Trumpers.  > which I'm having trouble comparing  Yeah, the source graph with its four lines pinging all around is a pain on the eyes. But an easy way to calculate it is to take the largest PresVsSen diff for the GOP/Dems (and I can share the Google Doc where I've calculated that if needed), subtract it from the smallest difference, and then you've got your range.  I've done this for [all the AZ Presidential elections where a Senate race was also on the ballot, heading back to 1916](https://imgur.com/PFGiYga). Before we continue, you're likely wondering why the lines track almost-perfectly before 1968 - it was  due to the lack of 3rd parties on the ballot getting any discernible % of the vote. With just 2 factors at play you've got one equally mirroring the other.  You'll see the average difference in 2024 was lower than in 2020 - but 2020's was already historically low. 2016 was high, but it was a wacky Senate election - McCain who was popular statewide but persona-non-grata to some Trumpers, Kirkpatrick with her large home turf appeal in a lot of the state's counties given the size of her House district, and also a Green candidate who got 4x the votes Stein got. Rewind back to 2012 and you've once again got a pretty small range of values, moreso for Dems than the GOP. But prior to that - 2004 and further on in the past - the ranges tend to stay in the double digits. They noticeably dip to around that line (or below) on 4 occasions:   * 1920, in the midst of a political realignment coming out of the Progressive Era into the reactionary Harding period, in the wake of the race riots and anarchists bombings of 1919 and World War I/the Spanish Flu. * 1944, during a period of a major nationalization of politics because the incumbent President (FDR) was running for an unprecedented 4th term, and the country was in the midst of WW2. * 1968, during the Civil Rights movement and George Wallace's 3rd party run. * 1992, the start of the Clinton-era realignment and Ross Perot's 3rd party run.  We are in another political realignment and de-alignment period, having begun with Obama and the Tea Party, running straight into Trump in 2016 and then 2020/2024. The folks whose ticket-splitting caused broader ranges in these countywide graphs - miners in Gila/Graham/Greenlee - have generally (but not entirely) stopped doing so, and are voting more of a lockstep party line.   Had McCain and Kirkpatrick been two relative randos like Carmona and Flake, I'd wager we'd see a range closer to 2012/2020 than 2004.  This shift downwards comes up (if to a more delayed extent) when looking at midterm races - the ranges in 2022 of the deltas between Kelly/Hobbs and Masters/Lake were just 1.52% and 3.12% respectively, vs. 7.95%/8.01% in 2018 (and 2.51%/3.09% for D/R in 2024).  And if I assume the idea behind looking at the uniformity is the theory that ""Oh, they decided to take 3/4% of Harris's vote and give it to Trump, and that's why Gallego keeps outrunning her by that much in each county (Gallego outruns by 2.32%-4.83%, Trump outruns Lake by 3.48%-6.3%)...why not rig the Gallego/Lake race as well? They absolutely wanted to win that seat. Why bother giving the Dems anything?  > although I expected a redder treasurer race  [Redder than the 4.8% GOP win in reality?](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Treasurer_election,_2024)  > So if Blacks or Muslims abstained, was it impactful anywhere there?   On the topline results? Absolutely, though I think in the case of the former it was less of a protest-vote abstention than the latter and more apathy/""legal"" voter suppression (and I don't know how many of the latter are in NC). On the difference in the range of the differences between the Presidential race and a big-ticket downballot when comparing 2020 and 2024? I don't know, because when you blend the numbers 3 separate ways like that you mix a whole bunch of conflating factors together and it becomes hard to disaggregate things - it's like a numerical version of telephone.  > Was anyone predicting this stuff?  That the GOP would probably hold offices like the Treasurer's (which they flipped in 2016 and have held every since) and lose the Gov/AG? Yeah. The 5 downballot Dem. statewide victories all are pretty straightforward in nature:  * SoS and AG: Seats Dems have won in elections nonstop since the dawn of the 1900's (in SoS's case 1876) with popular candidates * Governor: Popular candidate (incumbent AG) against Mark Robinson * Lt. Governor: Daughter of a very popular former Governor against someone chained at the hip to Mark Robinson's lunacy * Superintendent: GOP candidate (Michele Morrow) made even Robinson seem sane, having done things like call for Obama and Biden's execution while on the campaign trail.  It was only Riggs's skin-of-her-teeth Supreme Court win that was really much of an upset. And when you then move down to the relatively lower-level downballot statewides (Treasurer, AgComm, Insurance Comm, Labor Comm, Auditor) where Republican candidates weren't impacted by any sort of scandals like the Superintendent candidate was or those in closer proximity to Mark Robinson, the GOP won by margins comparable to the Presidential race.  > the new, post-J6 outpouring for Trump in particular  I think it's less outpouring *for* him and more *against* Biden/Harris. Biden was an unpopular president - his approval was in the high 30's - who demanded Harris leave [""no daylight""](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5191087-harris-trump-biden-harris/) between herself and him during the race. Some chunk of ""median"" voters - the kind the NYT interviews in focus groups - voted from Trump over cheaper eggs/broader inflation concerns (which sunk incumbents globally). Others [didn't realize Biden even dropped out, which is why that term trended on Election Day](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2024-08-01%202024-12-01&geo=US&q=did%20biden%20drop%20out&hl=en). Rightward trends among Asian and esp. Hispanic voters in 2020 and 2022 continued to manifest themselves, and Dems actively lost ground in that bloc.

Using it as ""people are getting dumber"" is victim shaming and blaming people for outcomes which they have little control over. Additionally the systemic psychological warfare from biased media is 100% weaponized and being deployed with great effectiveness.   Idiocracy at face value would be impossible as nothing would work anymore.

There are some signifigant differences in that gap but is still largely damaging for the United States and Americans at large.  What you say and what you do matters and - while we can applaud Romney doing the substantively correct thing in one sense (supporting impeachment) his other actions almost solely enabled Trump in regard to voting record.  I'll give you that Romney was more willing to buck Trump but he was both in an ultra red state (safe) and likely already planning his retirement so he didn't have much to lose.  My main overarching point is that we can't let Trump allow us to normalize people like Romney or Bush, their views need to be largely viewed as unacceptable, fringe, brutal, and ineffective.

"I absolutely agree that we cannot normalize the bulldozing of our Constitution.  But on the other hand, I believe we also need to make space for Republicans who hold fascists accountable. If we allow a Republican to be an ally on that policy alone, then we have the potential to address this mess we find ourselves in. We can debate tax policy after we save our democracy. But there will be no good-faith debate occurring if our government is fully taken over by authoritarians.  Honestly, it might be too late for the US. But I still think there needs to be a path forward for MAGA defectors. As Trump's tariff policies start to impact our economy, it's possible that some of the MAGA crowd will have their eyes opened. Shunning them won't help anything.",Explode-trip,2025-05-02T11:18:58,1

"You are completely ignoring reality. You need to actually look outside your day to day and look into why the DOD has had to put so much money into dealing with the sexual assault problem. I’m sure it’s for funsies. I’m sure that the fact that it’s only in the past two years that reports of sexual violence have dropped. And that’s only in the Army, all other branches have seen an increase. Now, remembering that many assaults go unreported (as in *most*), let’s look at what the Pentagon shows as far as *reported* instances: “According to the report, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.” “While reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.” “The Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That online survey came out last year, so it was not done this year.  Last year’s survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.”  I think there’s a problem and I think that people like you who refuse to acknowledge that this isn’t ok at the very least allow the issue to continue. If the military is so wonderful at investigating these allegations why are so many victims not coming forward? I’m not in the military but they are and they clearly see that the picture is not the one you are painting.",Kimothy42,2025-05-02T14:53:33,1

I'm willing to work with people on issues we agree on - even if it is one issue.   All of this pending the state of our democracy - our Overton Window certainly needs to be somehow rolled back in many (but not all) elements to at least the 90s or farther.    The scope of what is viewed as acceptable policy (mostly economically - socially we're largely better but still have progress to make and Trump's racism+authoritarianism and Biden's Israel enabling are/were both majorly damaging to any progress we were making) has been allowed to go so far off the rails and we're in a place now where 25% of the country may just be too far gone.,Saffuran,2025-05-02T11:32:20,2

"You wrote a lot of words to ignore my point. The question is whether sexual assault is taken seriously or not which, by your own admission, it is (problem identified cause panic and a huge infusion of funding). I cannot control individuals or their actions, I can control how I, as a leader responsible for their well being and success, react to it and what steps I take to mitigate it. Again, the wider point is that women are treated very well in the military by military officials, and that their reports are taken seriously, not that some E-1 from the middle of nowhere will behave themselves at a unit event.",LSOreli,2025-05-02T15:02:27,1

Please note the only thing you've said is that one of our two parties, the one in opposition to what's currently going on, is useless and should not be supported.  We're trying to rally and build a movement, and all you can say is, 'No don't do it *there*. No don't do it with *them*. *They* won't help you.'
