"There are commercials all over the airwaves for car dealerships claiming they have “tariff free inventory“ or “employee pricing” that’s just cars currently sitting on their lot they want you to buy so they don’t get overstocked. Let the inventory pile up, let the shelves run dry, once the people finally rise and drag the politicians out of their offices order will be restored.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T10:00:08,36

My worst fear is that all of this is to sow chaos that they will use to train the AI running DOGE and Palantir.    My only thought is to become ungovernable at a population level and throw off the modeling. Functioning mutual aid networks across normally non overlapping communities (for example) and smart resistance where we're predictably docile.,vucubcame,2025-05-04T09:43:46,16

"Same as last time people. Medicine and stuff in the nearby aisles. OTC pain relief, sleep pills, toothpaste, etc. Fill up on prescriptions. Don't panic buy just buy what you'll need.

"Why would China care at all about old stock in USA? Old stock of what, cruise missiles and gasoline?  China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-05-04T10:22:03,9

"The problem with that is that they built a system that supposedly gets better with more chaos. There are few things I can think of that justify Trump's tariffs besides softly declaring war on the world and damaging the U.S. internally so badly that the federal government has to step in. Once that happens, because he's already consolidated power in the Executive, he alone determines resource allocation and can weaponize it against states like he did during covid - more or less support based on ideology and compliance.      Trump caused the chaos within which Palantir is designed to work.      [https://youtu.be/\_KuQY1WDs4s?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/_KuQY1WDs4s?feature=shared)",vucubcame,2025-05-04T10:04:08,6
