"The advantage Pritzker has over every other potential candidate is he is the easiest to understand, and he’s very relatable.   High school, some high school, college, some college, advanced degree, ESL people, everyone in between… they can understand Pritzker.   He talks simply. Might be strange to think that is a key component to electability, but it is.   A vote here or there, in the rust belt. In south Florida. In an industrial town. At a union event. Etc…  All those votes add up and really, really, matter in terms of the electoral college.   For that reason alone, he’d be a very prudent choice for the Party.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-27T14:46:41,32
"No chance he'll be presidential candidate, he's not even 60, just a baby by Dems standards",EspressioneGeografic,2025-04-27T14:25:46,13
The Democrats need to run a champion of the the working class. Not a billionaire.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-27T14:28:32,16

"Looks like the first person is about to step up to offer himself to the democratic cannibal machine.  Its gonna take maybe 30 minutes after this fundraiser for people to start insisting he's not good enough or not right for the job, when we all know what they really mean is that he's not Bernie Sanders.   That train is never late.",LionBig1760,2025-04-28T01:42:54,0

"> He talks simply. Might be strange to think that is a key component to electability, but it is.   So does Tim Walz and he was painted as a ""total moron"" by Republicans for months. To be fair, they also claimed he was a radical leftist communist beholden to the elite corporations (???) but Republican voters will believe anything Fox tells them.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-27T14:59:33,18
Actually he is 60.,Professional_Deer464,2025-04-27T20:56:53,5
Need to know our history. FDR was wealthy and was the best president for the working class this country has seen. Pritzker has been amazing for Illinoisans of all creed. Don’t count him out.,Common-Wallaby8972,2025-04-27T14:31:55,28
The democrats need to rally behind whoever the nominee is.,Ok_Host4786,2025-04-27T14:48:35,16

"Tough to say a guy with a law degree, who has a law school with his last name attached, and is a two term landslide governor is a “total moron.”",Common-Wallaby8972,2025-04-27T18:54:19,3
"Yeah Pritzker and Walz are the flag bearers in this category. Pritzker isn’t hokey, Walz is. But other than that difference they are pretty similar in this regard. That’s their strength.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-27T15:45:17,3
He has a youthful face. ,DancingWithAWhiteHat,2025-04-27T20:59:09,2
I wouldn't put it past them. Walz was a teacher for years and years and all the mouth breathers who barely passed school claimed he's stupid. They also campaigned on Harris being stupid just because she's a woman.,CassadagaValley,2025-04-27T20:04:44,5
