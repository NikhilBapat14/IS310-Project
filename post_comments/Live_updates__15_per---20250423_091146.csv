"God the Washington post used to be an excellent example of quality reporting, a pillar of respectable journalism.  Now it’s clickbait, pseudo reporting that remains unable to properly tell a coherent story without blurring the messaging.   Sure 15% of young people see trump on the right track—but 85% DONT. That doesn’t seem to fit in line with the 2024 election results of Gen Z, seems like that age demographic is regretting their votes.   That’s the story to lead with.",Partitionbaby,2025-04-23T09:36:20,5

"Well, the informal consensus is that 32% of the electorate are MAGA who will support Trump blindly - meaning, the nutters beyond redemption. That the young is at maximum 15% - you can shave a few points because they don't understand the world yet, a stupid + testosterone mix creates its own momentum - that is similarly irredeemable. That's a good sign the next generation is a smaller tranche.",steve_ample,2025-04-23T10:05:59,3

"Some younger voters chose trump because they didn't like Biden's policy regarding Israel/Gaza, and VP Harris said she wouldn't have changed anything. They knew he was not on their side when it comes to topics like women's reproductive rights, student loan debt, voting rights tariffs etc., but they were willing to overlook those other things.  Although the crisis in Gaza hasn't ended, maybe these voters think he's handling it the way they want -- even though he's soiling the sheets in every other area?",kh-38,2025-04-23T09:35:01,1
