Yknow I remember when the republicans were the ones that were super super anti Russia. Like I mean it was a bipartisan thing but republicans especially,lun_a_g,2025-05-07T23:12:43,18
Russia was the aggressor that started this war and invaded another country of course they are not being realistic. Republicans are idiots for supporting Russia.,sedatedlife,2025-05-07T22:50:30,28

"“Russia violated the Budapest memorandum in 2014 with its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.[6][7] As a response, the United States, United Kingdom, and France provided Ukraine with financial and military assistance, and imposed economic sanctions on Russia, while ruling out ""any direct interventions to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia"".[6]”   Seems like the Budapest agreement did nothing to prevent Russian incursion in the past.  Do you think specific US economic interest in the region could prevent future incursions as it would be considered a direct action against the United States?",super0cereal0,2025-05-08T00:50:19,-5

They didn’t or else each country would have sent troops in aid. Instead weak leaders did nothing which enabled Putin to go in again and try and claim the rest.,Peacefulgamer2023,2025-05-08T01:00:10,4
