Our full [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/wiki/rules) can be found here, but are summarized below.  * Address the question (and its replies) in a professional manner * Avoid personal attacks and partisan ""point scoring"" * Avoid the use of partisan slang and [fallacies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_fallacies) * Provide sources if possible at the time of commenting.  **If asked, you must provide sources.** * Help avoid the echo chamber - downvote bad/poorly sourced responses, not responses you disagree with.  **Do not downvote just because you disagree with the response**. * Report any comments that do not meet our standards and rules.  Further, all submissions are subject to manual review.  If you have any questions, please contact the mods at any time.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
