"While I’m glad he’s speaking out, the one that needs to be front a center condemning Trump’s actions is W.",Ladyhawkeiii,2025-04-04T07:32:16,80
Obama knew that Trump was a racist!,icey_sawg0034,2025-04-04T08:31:04,18
Finally!  All the former presidents should be screaming about all this.  I know decorum and the past practice of not criticizing a sitting president- I don’t care about decorum-the orange felon is turning the US into a dumpster fire.,Exciting_Fact_3705,2025-04-04T07:08:30,54

Seriously. Like what kind of red hot whatever does Drumpf have on him to keep him silent? Simple decorum can’t be it. Honestly it’s beyond weird.,WarriorGma,2025-04-04T08:22:53,24
W as in Who? His only redeeming feature is his crush on Michelle Obama. He didn’t speak up pre election so I expect the same now.,suesue_d,2025-04-04T15:49:53,1
"Donny dumpster certainly never practiced decorum or restraint outside of office, inside or any place really. I detest his bad manners but his outright lies and insistence on running our country into the ground means we can't be silent - including Obama and other living presidents.",GimmieGummies,2025-04-04T13:47:50,3
"He knows he facilitated this and doesn’t want to be involved anymore. So he’s hiding, like the little bitch boy he is.",Ladyhawkeiii,2025-04-04T08:26:04,24
Dude went from one of the most hated people in the world to Michelle Obama’s kooky old friend that paints in his spare time. Why would he want to come back into the political limelight?,Spaceman-Spiff,2025-04-04T13:14:34,2
"If Darth Cheney could speak out, so could W. He made his choice.",suesue_d,2025-04-04T15:51:17,1
"He *should* come back and try to help fix some of the mess he, personally, helped to create. I sincerely doubt he will.",Ladyhawkeiii,2025-04-04T14:02:59,2
He took an oath- twice- to uphold the Constitution of our nation. I don’t believe that oath simply “stops” because he leaves office. Clearly he feels differently.,WarriorGma,2025-04-04T22:06:27,1
