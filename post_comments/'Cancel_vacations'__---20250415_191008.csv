"These lower court judges exiting their jurisdiction to give national edicts and attempting to run the country from their benches are cute, but it's time for Congress and the SCOTUS to reign them in and remind them what power they actually have.",ITrCool,2025-04-15T19:14:25,182

A citizen of EL Salvador is currently in his home country.  This judge can eat shit.  The end.    Edit. As an aside these leftist losers or fellow conservatives didn't give two shits about Biden doing nothing about the American citizens being held by Hamas after October 7th.  Now we have this fake outrage about an illegal sent back to his own country.  ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-15T19:26:32,120

"Does this judge have any idea what facilitate means, the supreme court already explicitly said that the courts cannot force a foreign government to give up one of their own citizens to us, only to immidiately be deported again once we officially waive the withold removal order that he isnt even allowed to have.    Facilitate means that if el salvador wants to we have to provide the plane",ultrainstict,2025-04-15T19:49:53,23

"As far as I know El Salvador has refused to return this guy.  Does facilitate mean sending letters every week asking for his return?  A commando raid?  Something in-between?  Who decides?  Is the govt. in contempt if it tries and fails?  Must it try forever?  Three times?  Legalities aside, this is a huge win for the Administration from an optics perspective.  This guy had a deportation order that was only stopped by the asylum system that everyone knows is completely abused.  Yet you never see judges fretting about that.",bearcatjoe,2025-04-16T08:23:05,5

"We paid (or are paying, not sure if re-ocfuring ) 6 million dollars to host deportees in this El Salvador prison.  It is a local governments decision on what to do with deportees, but in this situation they were shipped directly to a prison in another nation that we paid (are paying) for without due process against judicial orders that he was not to be deported back to El Salvador.   You are right that at this point we have little we should do to force Bukele hand, (but we could like cancelling payments or tariffs if they don't release him) but the problem this administration has made an acknowledged mistake and sent a man without due process to a prison in another country.  That is a problem.  At this point beyond optics I don't really care what happens to the man (which sounds terrible) but we cannot ignore the that we sent a man to a prison in  another nation that we are paying for without due process. The precedant is insane and Trump just yesterday was talking about doing the same thing with ""homegrown us citizens"".
