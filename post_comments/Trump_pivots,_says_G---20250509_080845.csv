"He did not fucking pivot because he was never serious about it in the first place. When he said he supported raising taxes on the rich he went ahead and said right then and there that it would not happen. He was literally just trying to score a cheap point among idiots and every news outlet who acts like it was remotely serious is fucking culpable for helping him spread those God damn lies.

A lie can travel half way around the world before truth gets out the door  It’s a lie to make people who vaguely pay attention think he cares about the poor or isn’t completely pro billionaire at their expense without actually doing anything because people will remember what he said over what he actually does,Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-09T09:56:48,8
"When Donald Trump wants to do something, he tells Congress to do it. If Congress doesn’t do it, he writes a bogus EO or pulls a national emergency to do it anyway. When courts, including SCOTUS, tell him what he’s doing is illegal, he continues doing it.   If Donald Trump wants to do something, it will be done.

">“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”  Jean Paul Sartre",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-09T12:19:18,3
