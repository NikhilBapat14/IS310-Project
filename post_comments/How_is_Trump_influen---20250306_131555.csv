"Trump- and many Americans, perhaps influenced by media-driven propaganda or years of ingrained exceptionalism, have misjudged their country’s true standing. There’s a widespread belief that the US can act without consequence- imposing tariffs, seizing resources, and making unilateral decisions without repercussions. Even my American friend, a Democrat, has an inflated sense of the US’s global importance.  The reality is that if the EU chose to chart their own course, they have the economic and geopolitical strength to do so. EU is the second largest economy in the world and, if the US continues down this trajectory for four years, is likely to become the stronger economy.   He’s united Europe in a way I’ve never seen in history.  Trump has united left and right across Europe in condemning his actions. Not only this, even our far right have disassociated themselves from him, and condemn his actions. The damage this is doing to the US is unprecedented. This has been the ultimate betrayal by the US to Europe’s biggest crisis since WWII, and I think there will be a soviet-level hatred of the US across Europe for a long long time to come…",PremiumTempus,2025-03-07T03:35:36,44

"Not necessarily left-wing politics, but what I can see is that (at least temporarily), he brought different parties closer. The polarization seems less, while unity takes place. This is due to Trump being a threat to the world order as we know it, so countries have to stay united and not succumb to polarization. It remains to be seen whether this is a ""rally around the flag"" effect, or it's permanent - I guess this also depends on Trump. As long as he has a new batshit crazy take every day, countries will distance themselves more and more, meaning their influence and power weaken, which leads to desiring more unity.  Look at EU as a whole - they just did something extraordinary because of Trump (800 billion rearmament, coalition of the willing, etc.). Or look at Canadians, who, with a smile on their face, stand united against the USA and would endure economic hardship just to defend their nation. Or Ukraine, where Zelensky has an astronomical favourability after what went down in the Oval Office. They are now counterattacking and have tactical successes (not for long though, because Trump disabled U.S. weapons and intelligence, so they can't shoot down stuff and can't do long-range strikes, both of which are crucial to the war effort).  Long story short: more unity, less polarization, because of a common threat: Trump. This will have very strong consequences on the U.S. economy, but it can't be seen yet.",clouds_to_africa,2025-03-07T02:50:01,25
"I think in Europe we are seeing far right parties move away from trump, such as Nigel farage’s reform party in the UK, and Le Pen’s front nationale in France. JD Vance’s insulting rhetoric against UK involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan really didn’t help either.   I think what is not being talked about enough is the impact trump’s policies are having in states that are in the process of becoming authoritarian states. For example the pro-Russian government in Georgia has used trump and Elon’s rhetoric around USAID calling it a regime change agency as an excuse to clamp down on civil society in general. We are also seeing more silly right wingers doing the Nazi salute as a dog whistle to their supporters, eg the crazy Romanian presidential candidate georgescu did a sneaky salute coming out of the police station after he was arrested.",Adonbilivit69,2025-03-07T05:27:46,16
"My concern is that extreme Trumpism, as I am calling the chaos of his second term, will become the norm for the Republican party. Post Trump, some desperate candidate looking to forge ahead of the pack will promise Trump style isolationism and sadly too many registered Republicans will look back at Trump's era fondly and ignore the utter chaos that accompanied it. And so alliances and treaties that have been mended will be torn down again. The US will become the cat of the world exiting and then resuming, or rather attempting to resume, it's role on the world stage every few year.

"We might be seeing the end of neoliberalism, which i know is a super loaded term but ill try to define it for my purposes.   Neo liberalism was the idea that by entangling our economies, we could make the costs of war so high that the countries would find alternatives and peace would reign. Despite all of the negative side effects that's been largely successful and the developed world has experienced a long stretch of peace and prosperity.    But the lever that was supposed to be used to keep bad actors in line, sanctions and isolation, only works if there is a unified view of what's right and that was never fully the case.    So the dominant economies ended up posing a direct threat to the economies that weren't in that club and the countries that weren't economically strong enough to have been invited in ended up getting kicked around by the big blocs that formed.   For a long time, those locked out groups have sought to destabilize the whole thing because it's been squeezing them to change in ways they don't want to. That's a goal Russia has now achieved. They've broken the north American trade bloc, they are driving wedges into the European trade bloc, they have seriously damaged NATO and they are set up to achieve even bigger victories on all of those fronts in the foreseeable future.   The result will be more isolationism, more disconnection, more conflict, more war and more opportunity for the states who had previously been subject to sanctions and isolation to pursue their anti-global goals.   So no, we're not seeing a resurgence if left wing politics. We're seeing the neoliberal dam break and all the right wing isolationists having a field day.",KitchenBomber,2025-03-07T09:18:42,6

"If you want to make a bull case, this is THE reason why the EU will not only stay together, but begin to function and expand as a (limited) empire. Why?   1. Most obviously, just for the sake of making the point, with the absence of the United States, Europe is now forced to develop their security infrastructure. This does not happen in a vacuum - it forces the EU to also develop a more integrated economic structure, make its physical infrastructure compatible and interchangeable from its railway network to changing a tire to sourcing and manufacturing parts to maintain its energy infrastructure. It also has a ""weeding out"" effect wherein weaknesses are no longer tolerable. Germany has just thrown out its debt brake for military investment, which will almost certainly infuse the EU's largest economy with fresh blood, the EU is learning how to make problematic members (ie Hungary) irrelevant and is likely to formalize a forced exit process at some sort, and it is learning to more closely integrate non-members such as Iceland and the UK. You could write stacks of essays on this integration process alone, but in short, it is an evolutionary force of sorts that will force them to adapt by binding together to the point of functionally being a single state.   2. The sleeping bear here is Turkey. Turkey has the strongest fundamentals of any EU/NATO country and is posed to become a regional power. They have not been subtle about smelling blood these past few weeks - they want to fill the vacuum that the US is leaving behind and become a leader of NATO, or its successor organization. This is for three reasons. Firstly, Turkey is sometimes misunderstood as being friendly to Russia, when in actuality this isn't and has never been the case. Russia is an occasional convenience to play with but ultimately a thorn in Turkey's side, and that's not limited to the European theatre. Turkey sees this is an opportunity to pull that thorn out. Secondly, NATO has a worldwide network that Turkey wants to become more integrated with (think Japan and company). Thirdly, Turkey wants to pursue its ambitions in the Middle East and have maintain influence in Europe.   3. The EU will expand its worldwide ties. CANZUK, a long proposed EU-like union of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, has recently come back into the mix, but regardless of whether that takes shape the de facto new structure will be the Western Arc, spanning from the EU to UK to Canada to Japan to Australia to NZ. Note the historic relationships here - Quebec/France, the Commonwealth, UK/EU, etc. These countries all have existing relationships with China that there is begrudging yet mutual benefit to develop further, and the Western Arc will also expand its relationship with Russia. Yes, I said Russia. The current rendition of the Russian state will last another 30ish years. Their fundamentals are weak, and Kyiv, not Moscow, was the original and more organic power center of what I'll loosely call the former territory of ""Kievian Rus"". Moscow is a post-Mongol artificial construct. the Western Arc & Allies will seek control of the parts of modern Russia that are geographically favorable to it, like any other empire. They will look the other way as China (likely not a single country either by that point) takes much of the east, and Europe/Canada will secure the parts of its geography that are strategically viable (and defensible) to it, for example Crimea and ex-Finland and Kaliningrad. Separatist regions will take their cut, and there are quite a few of them. Nothing past the Urals makes any sense whatsoever for them though, and the majority of Russia's physical land will largely be the wasteland it always has been.   Note that the geographical boundaries might be slightly different - it's entirely possible that China, France, and the US duke it out over parts of Canada, or that the NE United States breaks away and joins the Western Arc. Short term, Ukraine is very likely to lose some of its territory. The United States will eventually shrivel to a mid-tier state - they have strong enough fundamentals to take care of themselves, likely as an authoritarian Russia-like but largely stable state, but other states will carve up their current global network as they forfeit it.",ConfusingConfection,2025-03-07T15:57:17,1

"Trump’s influence on global politics—especially in other Western nations—has been a destabilizing force, fueling the rise of far-right movements while simultaneously pushing some leftist resistance. His political brand—rooted in nationalism, xenophobia, authoritarianism, and corporate dominance—has emboldened similar figures across Europe, Canada, and beyond, shifting the Overton window toward extremism. However, this has also created a counter-reaction, with some countries experiencing a renewed push for leftist policies as a direct response to Trumpist-style politics.  The Spread of Trumpism and the Far-Right Resurgence  One of Trump’s most significant impacts on global politics has been his normalization of far-right rhetoric and policies, giving legitimacy to nationalist, anti-immigrant, and anti-democratic forces worldwide. Leaders like Marine Le Pen in France, Giorgia Meloni in Italy, and Viktor Orbán in Hungary have capitalized on this wave, using Trump’s tactics—disinformation, culture war fearmongering, and attacks on institutions—to gain traction. 	•	Europe’s Nationalist Shift: In several European countries, Trump’s presidency emboldened far-right parties that were previously seen as fringe movements. The AfD (Alternative für Deutschland) in Germany, the National Rally in France, and Brothers of Italy have all gained momentum, using rhetoric strikingly similar to Trump’s: anti-immigration hysteria, Euroskepticism, and appeals to economic protectionism. 	•	The UK and Brexit Aftershocks: While Brexit predated Trump, his election further validated the populist, anti-globalist sentiment that fueled it. Figures like Boris Johnson adopted Trump-style tactics—brash nationalism, attacks on “the elites,” and an open disdain for international cooperation. 	•	Orbán’s Hungary as a Trumpist Model: Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s authoritarian leader, has openly modeled his leadership on Trumpism, implementing harsh anti-immigrant policies, cracking down on press freedom, and cementing corporate oligarchy—all while maintaining a populist facade.  Trump’s impact isn’t just ideological—it’s economic as well. His trade wars and tariffs destabilized global markets, forcing countries like Canada, Germany, and China to reassess their economic dependence on the U.S. His withdrawal from international agreements (like the Paris Climate Accord) weakened collective action on major global issues, creating power vacuums that countries like China and Russia have sought to exploit.  The Left-Wing Resistance and Resurgence  That said, Trumpism hasn’t gone unchallenged. In some cases, the backlash to his policies has galvanized progressive movements, leading to renewed support for left-wing and pro-democracy policies. 	•	Canada’s Response: Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods ignited a wave of economic nationalism, reinforcing public support for progressive economic policies and trade agreements outside of U.S. control. Justin Trudeau, despite being a centrist, had to position himself as a defender of Canadian sovereignty against Trump’s aggression, and leftist movements in Canada have since pushed harder for economic justice and social protections. 	•	Europe and Ukraine Solidarity: Trump’s appeasement of Russia and weak stance on Ukraine pushed European nations to take a firmer stance against authoritarian aggression, leading to increased military and economic coordination between EU nations. In turn, this has strengthened center-left coalitions in some areas, as voters see the dangers of nationalism and isolationism. 	•	Latin America’s Leftist Wave: While not typically grouped with “Western” nations, Latin America has seen a major resurgence of leftist governments, partially as a rejection of Trump-era policies that favored corporate exploitation and right-wing regimes. Leaders like Gustavo Petro in Colombia, Gabriel Boric in Chile, and Lula da Silva in Brazil have all risen on platforms that counteract Trump-style authoritarian capitalism.  So, Is There a Leftist Resurgence?  The answer is mixed. In some places, Trump’s influence has fueled reactionary nationalism, accelerating far-right power grabs. But in others, his presidency (and now, his continued influence under the Musk-Trump administration) has exposed the failures of conservative, corporate-driven governance, strengthening progressive movements that demand economic justice, human rights, and environmental action.  However, the left is still fighting an uphill battle. The far-right has spent years weaponizing disinformation, corporate media, and billionaire-backed think tanks to spread Trumpist ideology worldwide. While progressive movements are growing, they often struggle against the sheer funding and institutional power that right-wing forces have amassed.  If leftist and pro-democracy movements want to capitalize on this backlash, they need to move beyond simply opposing Trumpism and offer bold, clear alternatives—policies that center workers, dismantle corporate oligarchies, and address systemic inequities. Because as history shows, when people are left without a compelling progressive vision, they default to the reactionary politics of fear and division that Trump and his allies thrive on.",GemmaOrtwerthAuthor,2025-03-07T23:26:25,1

"> There’s a widespread belief that the US can act without consequence- imposing tariffs, seizing resources, and making unilateral decisions without repercussions. Even my American friend, a Democrat, has an inflated sense of the US’s global importance.  I'm going to be blunt here. I'll believe there's consequences when I see them.  > The reality is that if the EU chose to chart their own course, they have the economic and geopolitical strength to do so. EU is the second largest economy in the world and, if the US continues down this trajectory for four years, is likely to become the stronger economy.  The EU absolutely could, if they were coordinated, of if a single person controlled Europe and could get around a host of coordination issues. Europe, at one point, controlled 6 out of the 7 continents on earth. There's a couple wrinkles that are going to make it hard for Europe to do this, however.  The world wars seem to have broken the European will to do... well, anything beyond economic sanctions. And even those, they're really reluctant to do if there's literally any downside to themselves. Look at how long it took to get sanctions on Russia, and even then, they didn't really stop buying oil from Russia, but instead just capped the price. They confiscated assets of a few oligarchs as well, but only assets outside of Russia. Europe hasn't shown any willingness to do anything outside of writing strongly worded letters, and that's not going to cut it in the multi-polar world where hard-power is important that we seem to be heading towards. You can only embargo a country once, and it's not clear Europe has any tricks up their sleeve if that doesn't work, and it's not clear that their leadership is willing to put their people through the hardship of even doing that. Now, the US hasn't exactly undergone any serious hardships since the great depression, but that brings us to wrinkle number two.  Europe is full of democracies, whose demographics are used to generous social spending. This, generally speaking, makes Europe a very nice place to live. But it's not clear that the voters will tolerate the reduction in social spending that would be required to match the US in military spending (realistically, they'd have to exceed it for about a decade to catch up, PPP adjusted of course), whereas the US has a proven will to forego social programs for massive military spending. Without that, they seem more likely to become vassals of China (assuming both the US and Russia are off the table). I'm not sure that would actually be any better than what they have now, but it's definitely an option. I'd caution against this, as China has a very long memory, and the century of humiliation didn't end that long ago for them (and was mostly wrought by Europeans), but it's not exactly my call.  The third wrinkle is that the EU wouldn't be operating in the world as it is today. For the past 80 years or so, Europe has mostly been relegated to the US's conscience within the world of geopolitics, and very strategically important places for the US to put military bases (though with the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of China, less strategically important than they were during the cold war). In the world you're proposing, the EU doesn't just have to build a credible deterrent to Russia and China, they also have to be able to deter a US that no longer has its conscience, and is much more willing to give into its impulses towards ""frontier justice"" than you're used to. A Europe that goes its own way has a lot of ground to make up, and ideally very quickly.  Edit: works -> doesn't work, the point doesn't make any sense otherwise",Sarmq,2025-03-08T13:23:53,1

"This is true. And it’s so sad. We don’t want this divorce in Europe. We like US and the American people. We see Americans as family.   If you look at it, Trump is right about a few things. We should have never bought gas from Russia. We helped fund the war machine that we are now fighting. We should have rearmed a long time ago. We have used way too little on military spending. We did wrong. But Trump could have handled this differently. He could have made Europe spend more on military without cutting the alliance.   It took 80 years to build the alliance that trump destroyed in one month. We will be fine in Europe. But we are painfully aware that both EU and US stand stronger when we stand together and that that is no longer the case. It’s really sad. For most people in Europe this is a time of sorrow and disbelief. We never saw this coming….",BackgroundDinner3928,2025-03-07T18:38:14,6

"To his credit, Abbott called Putin out years ago. He did it in a kind of ridiculous way, so got mocked, but he was kind of right. Scomo is the one who approved the sale of Aus weapons to Ukraine, Aus troops as trainers etc.  Dutton would have to break significantly from his own party’s recent record if he wanted to back Trump’s play",AlamutJones,2025-03-07T03:04:54,7
"Many people in the US who voted for Trump are anti-Putin. But the Biden corruption narrative has tainted Ukraine and made Zelensky into a controversial figure. People are him and the current Ukraine government as corrupt. The irony is that the US stepped in over a decade ago now because the Ukraine government was thoroughly corrupt and taken over by pro-Russian politicians. But because Obama's and Biden's names are in the mix, they just take the current Ukraine corruption narrative at face value. Not realizing it's Russian propaganda.",nanotree,2025-03-08T08:34:53,4
