I would have thought the whole deportations without due process would be the uniting factor myself but this is also a problem along with *gestures* everything else.,Good_Vibes_Only_Fr,2025-04-25T13:23:15,37

"A populist left grounded in healthcare, not hashtags, could actually win back places like El Centro. People don’t need slogans. They need insulin, specialists, and a hospital that doesn’t vanish overnight. This crisis isn’t abstract. It’s in the ER, right now.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-25T13:28:57,10

"It certainly should be a central issue but might require some careful navigation. The danger of populism is average people can cling to different boogeymen and blame all sorts of people or things for their problems based on lack of understanding, such as becoming anti-vax. RFK, as crazy as he is, shows the populist appeal of also going after big pharma as well as medical experts who many Americans now distrust. Somehow we need to focus on going after companies without leading to distrust in all healthcare experts.",Scarlettail,2025-04-25T13:37:47,0

"From The Atlantic:  >The ongoing influence of the (progressive) groups can be seen in a new New York Times poll. **Asked to list their top priorities, respondents cited, in order, the economy, health care, immigration, taxes, and crime.** ***Asked what they believed Democrats’ priorities were, they cited abortion, LGBTQ policy, climate change, the state of democracy, and health care.*** That perception of the party’s priorities may not be an accurate description of the views of its elected officials. But *it is absolutely an accurate description of the priorities of progressive activist groups.*  >[https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-show-why-lost-234012734.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-show-why-lost-234012734.html)  Voters already perceive the Democratic party as being progressive and focused on healthcare.  That progressive branding hurts the party. Gallup:  >**Support for a more moderate Democratic Party among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents has grown by 11 percentage points, to 45%, since 2021.** At the same time, Democrats’ and leaners’ desire for a more liberal party has declined five points, to 29%, and preferences for no change in party ideology have fallen nine points, to 22%.  >[https://news.gallup.com/poll/656636/democrats-favor-party-moderation-past.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/656636/democrats-favor-party-moderation-past.aspx)  That should not be a surprise, as typical Democratic voters are largely *not* progressive / very liberal.  >The Democratic coalition is more ideologically mixed than the Republican coalition. Among voters who associate with the Democrats, about half say they are very liberal (16%) or **liberal (31%), while nearly as many say they are moderate (45%). Around 6% say they are conservative.**  >[https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-changing-demographic-composition-of-voters-and-party-coalitions/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-changing-demographic-composition-of-voters-and-party-coalitions/)  Per CNN exit polls, on a liberal / moderate / conservative scale, 58% of Biden's voters in 2020 were self-described conservatives or moderates.  Progressives are a subset of the 42% of Biden voters who were liberal in that survey.  There is a reason why the GOP tries to brand the Democrats as a progressive / leftist party: Because that brand helps Republicans.  There are pathways to bringing universal healthcare to the US.  Sanders is only getting in the way by tainting it as a giveaway program when it should be viewed as a practical improvement that lowers costs and improves access.",I405CA,2025-04-25T13:48:52,-4
"The deportations are pretty horrifying, but it's also categorically different from universal healthcare. Stopping the trampling of human rights is necessary, but it's just stopping something that shouldn't be happening. Guaranteeing everyone healthcare is a positive change. Democrats need to present a positive vision of the future for people.",Simmery,2025-04-25T13:33:15,23
"I feel like too many people are trying to make it one thing. To your point there is *everything else*. Why not simply a pro-democracy movement? Why not ""of the people, by the people, for the people?""   As a side note, I am actually more concerned about the whole due process debacle above everything else. It's a core issue for me.",fuckishouldntcare,2025-04-25T13:39:10,9
"The blunt reality is that reliable political support has to come from core issues that people are dealing with every day, all the time. One way to do that is through mass messaging and a media network under your political influence, but there's no ""leftist media"" of any significance to drive that. The other way to do that is to pick universal issues that directly hit most people - grocery prices, costs at the doctor/hospital, debt, home ownership, etc.  Deportations without due process are a huge issue, yes, particularly where it even hits citizens. But there's enough people with a gut reaction of ""well I don't look like them so I won't ever be in those shoes"" that they can forget about it the next day, and that's the problem.  One thing people on the left do need to remember that politics is an enthusiasm contest, not a morality one. Democracy is a cruel mistress - it's just better than all the alternatives.",henryptung,2025-04-25T15:24:03,6
"You underestimate how unifying the immigration is for a majority of Americans. I don't say that as one of them, but immigration is actually a winner for republicans and a loser for democrats broadly speaking, as depressing as that is.",68plus1equals,2025-04-25T16:50:52,2
"Yes, they picked Hillary, who was a life long opponent to universal health care.  I mean, it wasn't like she proposed it back in the early 90s, again when she ran in 2008 and called the failure to pass it back in the 90s her biggest regret during the 2016 campaign.",travio,2025-04-25T13:58:20,4
Don’t be an idiot who buys Russian propaganda. The trans issues were of almost zero importance to 90% of democrats. They were a fabrication.,schu4KSU,2025-04-25T19:09:10,3
"People fucking love socialist policies until they're reminded they're socialist policies.   Granted, I know liberals who claim they are ""moderate"" because they think that means ""they'd totally vote republican if the candidate was better"" and they want to be seen as open minded.    Also you guys tried that twice and lost to the worst man in existence, with Biden only succeeding because of how badly Trump botched covid responses. Barely. The vast majority still do not vote.    Something isn't working and we're getting tired of the democrats saying ""maybe this time it'll work"". ",Greencheek16,2025-04-25T15:43:07,2
"Hillary's healthcare plan back in 1993/1994 was infamously bad, both in terms of policy and the politics around it. Its failure is a large reason why we got the ACA, the plan created by Republicans in opposition to it, instead of something stronger like a public option or full universal healthcare since Democrats were so scared of again failing in that space in 2009-2010.",Naviers_stoke,2025-04-25T14:35:34,3
Uh huh sure ok I’ll bite. Then wtf is the DNC having a such a hard time finding the “ right message” to put out to the masses. You can say what you want but the DNC absolutely screwed the pooch on how to develop a message and how to push it out. I mean for godsake the DNC got smarted by the irgange man not once but fucking twice!! Like cmon,RuffDemon214,2025-04-28T08:31:46,1
"Voters already think that the Democratic party is progressive.  Not exactly working out well, is it?  Bernie Sanders lost two Democratic primaries by landslide margins, in spite of the fact that primary voters skew further from the center than do voters in general elections.  No reason to believe that he can get 270 electoral votes when he can't even win over the Democratic party.  Neither Chuck Schumer nor Bernie Sanders provide the winning formula here.  It is not a black-and-white universe.",I405CA,2025-04-25T15:47:45,0
"And Bernie's plan is so bad, *Republicans* are the only ones to have put it up for a floor vote, just to show how unserious it is. Bernie — rightfully not engaging the trolls — didn't even vote for it himself",00Oo0o0OooO0,2025-04-25T15:58:32,1
Because gullible people either a) choose a closed ecosystem of misinformation or b) get their information from social media feeds corrupted by foreign propaganda.  The DNC message at the core was you can either choose to continue democracy or allow autocracy.   The American people actually believed we had a poor economy under Biden.,schu4KSU,2025-04-28T08:38:09,1
