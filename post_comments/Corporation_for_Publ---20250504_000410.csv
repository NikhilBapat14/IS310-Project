"From the article:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is suing the White House over an attempt to remove three members of its board as part of President Trump’s promise to turn up the heat on outlets like NPR and PBS.  In a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the CPB alleges three members of its board of directors were notified by the White House on April 28 they were being terminated at Trump’s direction.  “The credible and urgent threats facing CPB, as a result of the Correspondence are not speculative or theoretical.

They do a lot better of a job broadcasting cohesively than all of these very strange non-literal and hyperbolic Domination narrative companies whose content and ideologies make no sense unless you've gotten into the Methylene blue one too many times and its running through your veins!,postsshortcomments,2025-05-04T00:24:32,0
