This makes me wonder if Kilmar was going to testify against Bukele? He did have a judicial order to not be removed. And Bukele sure doesn‚Äôt want to send him back home.    Just like Elon made sure anyone investigating him or Tesla for numerous reasons were removed from govt right away.    Just like Trump removed the prosecutors from his case AND Ghislene Maxwells case. And stopped the Epstein Files.    It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs all being cleaned up ü§î,forwardinmychucks,2025-05-06T09:07:03,3

"First, let‚Äôs get some facts straight (please be objective here).  El Salvador had a brutal civil war during the 1980s meant to prevent the spread of communism, and it was supported by the US. Out of those communists came out the political party known as FMLN, which is a Socialist party. After the war, most Conservatives fled the country giving FMLN a majority. Some of them were corrupt, giving FMLN a bad name. But FMLN is an inclusive party. Bukele‚Äôs family is actually from Palestine, but his family moved to El Salvador and were able to build massive wealth with ownership in media companies. Long story short, Bukele would never be allowed in Conservative parties so he went to FMLN.¬†  This allowed him to become mayor of its most populous city. He had tried his whole agenda of economic revitalization there but failed badly. As mayor, he tried to solve the gang problem by establishing a truce between gangs. Most Americans have no idea why this is so bad, but it‚Äôs a terrible move. In Mexico, one politician tried a truce between cartels, but this truce was unknown to the public, and it was the drug cartels who exposed this politician for letting drug cartels run their shady business as long as it was kept away from the public(so still executions and kidnappings, but complete media blackout). Basically, Bukele is telling the gangs that he will give them complete media blackout as long as they obey when he tells them to stay away from the issues hethat affect him. This would mean that gang members execute people deep inside the jungle where no one will ever know about it.¬†  Long story short, this gang member had a media personality and it allowed politicians to use it when they needed political bonus points. Now this gang member was able to flee and is in some other country exposing Bukele. And this hurts him because it shows that he is willing to let gang members do what they want so long as it benefits him¬†",JollyToby0220,2025-05-05T21:25:21,15
