"400 pages of lies, citing the likes of the NYT and Cass, to lay the groundwork to justify banning trans healthcare for youth first (that they define as individuals under 26!) and then certainly for all other adults. Any news org that gives this report credence (especially in headlines, looking at you Axios, PBS, AP) is complicit in the eradication of trans people in the US. This will only harm us. If you're cis you need to speak out against this at every opportunity or you too are complicit.",witchgrove,2025-05-01T13:19:05,54
"The most positive thing I can say is that this is the Health administration that is actively dismantling medical research, promising to investigate chemtrails, identifying the cause of autism by this fall, led by a vaccine denier while Medicare is going to be slashed later this year.  They are anti-science pretending to be anti-business and it's clear they aren't just targetting trans people, it's all disadvantaged people including poor people (less than $200k annually).  Transpeople need defending because they are vulnerable... and after taking out the most vulnerable people there are always more vulnerable people to attack.",lego69lego,2025-05-01T13:32:43,21

"Using your obsession with trans humans to force a “therapy” that is made up, hateful, and does nothing but perpetuate trauma is a particular kind of evil.",Imaginary_Ebb_9692,2025-05-01T17:48:55,2

"Extra fun note that the authors are anonymous.  Meaning this is more than likely completely made up horseshit and the claim that any medical professionals were involved is a bold-faced **lie**.  They know that their """"""sources"""""" will be ripped to fucking shreds under any scrutiny, and how much it cites and advances the Cass review is enough evidence as to how and why this was concocted.",Raeve_Noir,2025-05-01T13:33:40,28

"The report‘s metadata indicates these are among the most likely authors/compilers:   \- Alex Byrne, a Philosophy Professor at MIT, and known advocate for conversion therapy and transphobe  \- John Koenig, Degrees in Business and English   \-  Blake Sanchez, a Bachelor’s Degree in Neuroscience, Consultant at Guidehouse in Washington DC (HHS is one of their clients)   Not only are they not qualified, but they come with obvious conflicts of interest both with the subject matter (Byrne) and connections (Sanchez and possibly Koenig).  It’s nonsense.",Zealousideal_Rub5587,2025-05-01T18:03:42,15
