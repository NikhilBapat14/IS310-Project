"""Fascist dictator in waiting, Donald Trump, using the same methods as every other dictator for the last 1000 years, is using the legal system to remove all opponents of his rise to power."" - FTFY  It will not be long before insulting or disagreeing with him becomes a felony. We need our leadership to start acting NOW instead of waiting until they have this shit in place.  DO something or vacate your office and let someone who WILL do something be there.

"I hate these articles, they seem to celebrate as if something actually happened.  Pam Bondi will investigate ActBlue and file bogus charges, and the fundraising increase won’t likely cover the legal costs.  “Blew Up in his face” should be reserved for Act Blue revealing that Melania donated $200k to them in 2024.",phxees,2025-04-26T07:59:04,122

"Some of the accusation deserved at least an explanation. There were a couple of retired people who were asked if they had given thousand who denied it, and several showing hundred of donations over several days. If it was an overzealous staffer, its better to admit the mistake and move on, than keep fighting until they prove it in court and destroy the organization.",Country_talker,2025-04-26T16:43:44,-2
