"Trump had given the people ( idiots for a simple description), the opportunity to be rude, to openly hate, to be violent. This is what got him elected.  And the majority of those people have no idea, or care for what he is and has done to our country. Those people now have friends ( new family) with open arms, in every state. Quite like a cult begins.  The Alone and Lonely will not be alone anymore.  Many of those people are urging a civil war.",Alternative_Gate4158,2025-04-13T22:28:54,1
"I think it's time we start flying our flags upside down... I mean probably was weeks ago but at this point theirs no denying it. This is an unacceptable breach of democratic protocol at this point. If you have a flag put it out upside down, if you don't have one, get one and put it out upside down. This is not ok and we the people need to hold them accountable.  https://www.americanflags.com/blog/post/when-can-you-fly-the-american-flag-upside-down?srsltid=AfmBOopVyJm9sQRxX-mWUZPvhoLdkQskbNS87mLiMa4JHep777XX4-wf",Insane_Salty_Potato,2025-04-14T19:11:17,1

Tattoo on a brown person? Gang tattoo. Tattoo on a white person? A tattoo. Doesnâ€™t matter what it is.,swordrat720,2025-04-12T19:38:43,20
Because they all share in their hate and racism. They are willing to accept anything they do as long as they hate as much as they do. It has always been about shared hate. As soon as we all see that the better. They want an all white America . So we fight! Because they will never have it their way.,[deleted],2025-04-13T12:18:16,9

"""While some have theorized that one of Hegseth's tattoos contains a covert reference to a neo-Nazi symbol, that theory is questionable at best. It's important to note that neo-Nazis often rely on plausible deniability to hide their symbolism...   However, at least three of Hegseth's Christian-based tattoos do use symbols that are currently associated with â€” but don't necessarily indicate adherence to â€” Christian nationalist views.""  So it's not like he has SS, 88 or a swastika, but rather a collection of tattoos that when coupled with his publicly held beliefs, leads one to suspect he might be inclined to a bit of light fascism.",mrteas_nz,2025-04-12T18:44:57,23
"That is not what I interpreted.  Notice the part that neo nazi often rely on plausible deniability?  So he could always deny it, but the collection of symbols, and his actions in firing many minority and female military leaders are indicative of extreme leanings",tcumber,2025-04-12T19:25:21,13
"I feel like you just agreed with me but you think you're disagreeing? I'm not sure...  To be perfectly clear, I very much believe that Hegseth has white supremacist / Christian Nationalist / fascist opinions, which in my mind makes him a Nazi in all but name.  And because he can't call himself any of the things he is, he hides it behind pseudo imagery. So we all know he's a Nazi but we can't call him a Nazi.",mrteas_nz,2025-04-13T03:22:43,7
