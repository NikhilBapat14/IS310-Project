"Unfortunately that just might be who we are.  We in our little circles may find this appalling, but clearly a non too insignificant percentage of our population looks at what's going on and are celebrating it.",JadedIT_Tech,2025-05-07T15:25:06,24

"Yes it is.  Unless something is done to stop the damage, now, then yes.. it is. Had four years to do something about that,  as well. Did nothing.  That's your legacy. ",SubstantialTennis537,2025-05-07T15:26:45,6

"Throw it on the pile with religion and cops. You are defined by your worst elements, and the government is quickly filling up with the worst that America has to offer.  Those people that think this isn't what they are, are the minority now.",Keshire,2025-05-07T15:31:38,1
"People are angry. Politicians and news outlets told people their problems are because ""xyz"" and voted for the guy saying he will get rid of ""xyz"". The rest of us voted for the less terrible party that barely recognizes the problems, ""ridiculous workers rights, privatized healthcare, and the worst wealth inequality in American history"". Late stage capitalism is going to hurt. Best of luck and take care.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-07T15:46:56,1
"Get lost, Joe.   It’s exactly who we are. This imprudence, this hubris, Biden has.  The inability or unwillingness to grasp reality is costing us the republic. How fucking dare he spout off like this when _he failed to secure our country_.   I was such a huge fan of his term until he decided till he put his ego over our country.",-think,2025-05-07T21:57:21,1

there's no 'might' or 'maybe' about it.  Cruety is the point and 2/3 of Americans either voted for or couldn't care enough to vote against that cruelty.,SA_22C,2025-05-07T15:39:23,9
