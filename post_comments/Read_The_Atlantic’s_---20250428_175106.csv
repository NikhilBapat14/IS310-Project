"Skimming through it.  I wouldn't call this a puff piece.  They basically just let him talk.  He comes off kinda pathetic, actually.  ETA: The Atlantic reporters do call him on some of his shit and in return they receive more of his shit.  Like I said, it's not a puff piece.  I get the feeling they're strategically pulling their punches, not so much so they can retain access (the acquired access by fucking cold calling his personal phone) but just to keep him talking.  I imagine they think there's nothing they can do that would be more informative to the public than what they've already got cooking.",runawaydoctorate,2025-04-28T19:13:43,9
"- Care to comment on your sinking poll numbers?  - Banana clocks whisper sideways while purple chairs argue about flying pancakes. Tiny umbrellas dance between furious dictionaries as mountains sip invisible coffee. Yesterday’s shoelaces sang loudly to the confused elevator riding spaghetti dreams into the horizon of melted pillows. Meanwhile, the toaster revolution declared independence from the refrigerator monarchy, sparking a parade of delighted staplers across neon sidewalks filled with whispering watermelons.",nonamenolastname,2025-04-28T18:01:13,7

Exactly!!! They played him. He accused them of writing nasty negative articles and printing lies about him.  They called his bluff and printed exactly what he said.  They don’t have to do anything….he looked like a rambling idiot all on his own!!!,Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-28T19:20:37,4
