This is from the Chief minister of Kashmir essentially head of government in the state: https://x.com/OmarAbdullah/status/1921228736776527917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921228736776527917%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=about%3Ablank,One_Butterscotch8981,2025-05-10T11:11:24,150

So what happens if it really gets serious and they exchange nukes besides a lot of of people dying? I don't think India would launch first but Pakistan unfortunately is sketchy as fuck.,FormerBTfan,2025-05-10T15:50:46,25

I'll wait until I see a bit more on this one before judging. Misinformation has been pretty rampant on both sides of the border throughout the flair up. I'm hopeful that we see the ceasefire hold. A real escalation to war between these two could be catastrophic,ElderberryMental101,2025-05-10T10:54:43,22
Allegedly the Pak Army is acting against the wishes of the Pak Govt. So this may actually be a  c-o-u-p,deciduousredcoat,2025-05-10T12:43:10,146

"I think not even pakistan would launch nukes first in any normal scenario.   But there is always a chance for a mistake in protocol, a miscommunication, a misidentified missile.   But right now it's small scale enough that I believe that chance is very slim, unfortunately that situation might change",Dutchtdk,2025-05-10T17:12:10,7

"If true, it‚Äôs important to know just how widespread such actions are. Was this an isolated incident involving just one military element bucking orders or is it widespread throughout the entire Pak army?",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-10T13:37:13,32

"Only morons will think this is weakness. There'll always be setbacks in peace talks, especially between nations that really hate each other, but preventing escalation is a good thing. I don't want us to intervene in every conflict, but when nukes are on hand we should try to mediate.     Hopefully they can reach a lasting ceasefire. It's a shame the brigade here is rooting against that just because Trump is involved. They're sad people. ‚Äã",Hrendo,2025-05-10T11:46:43,-23

"It could very well be misinformation. Not to mention an hour ago reddit was still saying there was no ceasefire and pretending like it didn't exist, now they want to pretend oh there was a ceasefire and it got broken.  What were the terms of the ceasefire? When does it officially begin? If this is real was it sanctioned or not? Was it a mistake? There is tons of unknown information that could completely change the conclusion and implications here.",day25,2025-05-10T11:30:02,-61
"These are the same idiots who mocked Trump for trying to negotiate peace between Ukraine and Russia.  Weakness is doing nothing because you‚Äôre afraid of the perception of failure.¬†  Getting the prime minister to agree to a ceasefire is a major accomplishment. If this violation is a betrayal, it weakens Pakistans position. If it is insubordination, it is even more important.",dunkeater,2025-05-10T14:46:12,13
Do you think it does not? Indians who liked Trump are bashing him now.,One_Butterscotch8981,2025-05-10T11:45:40,40
"This is real and India has lost troops as a result, I don't think India has struck back just yet. As far as it being a rogue element or mistake I don't think so but it's possible. However these do not change the information as any violation across LoC can not be part of a Cease fire deal. And I get it that you are trying to find a win no matter what but Trump trusted Pak and pak violated it that's the reality.",One_Butterscotch8981,2025-05-10T11:32:57,48
I fail to see how it reflects on Trump,deciduousredcoat,2025-05-10T11:47:25,-5
Why would Pakistan agree to a ceasefire just to immediately violate it? Do you ppl even use your brain at all? Like what would be the point of that? It only hurts Pakistan. I get that you are trying to find a win for the left no matter what but this doesn't pass even a basic smell test.,day25,2025-05-10T12:11:23,-17
"Because trump mediated the deal. He announced the ceasefire first. And now, the deal that he announced, didn't do anything.",theboss2461,2025-05-10T12:07:06,48
"Honestly I think he should not have intervened, let India handle Pak. Or if someone breaks his deals there should be consequences for it. US aids Pak huge amount every year it should be slashed",One_Butterscotch8981,2025-05-10T11:49:28,19

"The left does what they do because they are indoctrinated from a young age to support a ruling class that benefits from their positions. It's either in the interests of the established elite or special interest groups like those who live off the government or want to bring their family, cheap labor, etc into the country.  This has nothing to do with being smart or not. Even unintelligent people can understand at a first order what is in their best interests and what is not. The problem for them is second and third order effects. But that is not the case here.  Also pretty ironic you are calling other people unintelligent while holding such an absurdly irrational position here just because you get to smear Trump. After you are proven wrong what will you tell yourself I wonder?",day25,2025-05-10T12:26:37,-17
Dude I am a pro trump guy but you are refusing to see the truth and Pak is doing what they are doing cause they hate India with a passion of a burning sun. You can't imagine the hate that is there. Also the more they are able to do so the more IMF and china props them up so pak loses nothing it can't do without,One_Butterscotch8981,2025-05-10T12:30:36,32
