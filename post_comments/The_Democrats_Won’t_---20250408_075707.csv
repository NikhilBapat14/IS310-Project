"Why does 1 democrat out of 213 in the house equal the democrats,¬† but 48/51 Republicans senators and 218 out of 218 republican house reps that worship trump don't equal all republicans?",Deep-Two7452,2025-04-08T08:06:27,217
"The latest iteration of the journalistically lazy ""Democrats in disarray"" died last week with good Dem electoral showings in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Florida, with Sen. Cory Booker, and with the Hands Off protests.   Also, Dems are free to speak their own minds while Republicans overwhelmingly live in fear of somehow angering The Orange One.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-08T08:38:28,33
why make noise when Trump Tariffs speak for themselves? Trump fascism speaks for itself. What can Democrats do when they control nothing?! Best they can do is file lawsuits and give 25 hour speeches‚Ä¶we the people can do more. Hit the streets. Boycott companies like Tesla. And companies that no longer support DEI. Shop at Aldi instead of Target‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶etc.,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-08T08:17:49,30
That is just 2 paragraphs on just 1 Democrat response video posted early in the 'game'.  The article is pretty meaningless.,Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-08T08:23:19,27
"""The president‚Äôs allies are putting up a bigger fight than the opposition party is.""  Looks like *The Atlantic* remains committed to provoking Idiot Trump, since he famously can't comprehend any material past the headline and a single bullet point.",YallerDawg,2025-04-08T08:22:32,8
Friendly reminder to the Atlantic: Republicans in the House have the numbers *right now* to impeach Trump. Republcans in the Senate have numbers at this moment to convict him on the impeachment charges and expel him from office.   That's how this end - or it doesnt.,iKangaeru,2025-04-08T10:57:08,3
"It‚Äôs too early to lay the blame on him yet. The administration is already saying countries are looking to negotiate deals. I think Trump just wants to tear up old deals, negotiate the same deals, but these will have his name on them. He‚Äôll then claim they‚Äôre better than the old deals, they‚Äôre actually the best deals ever. The problem is going to come when the factories he promised never materialize. He has all those Carhartt wearing MAGA that fill the fields at his rallies believing glory days of good paying factory jobs are coming back. He‚Äôs built in an excuse by saying it‚Äôs going to take a few years, but at some point they‚Äôre going to realize they‚Äôve been lied to.",regent040,2025-04-08T09:14:56,2

Hi folks remember that most of the democratic party is not far left. Once you realize that it makes sense. Also realize that far left candidates have become unpopular recently according to recent elections. Once you also realize that you can begin to blame the far left for pushing more people towards the center!,justmots,2025-04-08T08:49:17,-2
