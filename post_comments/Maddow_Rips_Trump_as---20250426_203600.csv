"Hitler was very popular. Yeah, he lost the election, but he still had a high approval rating among the general public. It's just he was viewed as inexperienced compared to Hindenburg, but he was seen as Hindenburg's natural successor. And, given that Hindenburg was in his mid-80's, Hitler's coming to power wasn't some far off hypothetical ""What if...?""      Hitler went out of his way not to antagonize the public. Hitler and the Nazis' first order of business was getting the country out of the depression and rebuilding infrastructure that had been out of commission since the WW1. He didn't just win the support of the Germans, Hitler was one of the most popular leaders on the planet at one point.   The Nazis made a concerted effort to seduce the German public. Every action that we look back on and think, ""Well that should have tipped them off,"" (the Reichstag Fire, Kristallnacht, The Night of the Long Knives) was carefully framed in such a way that the Nazis controlled the narrative and the public believed it.  Do you think the majority of the public would believe a Trump false flag operation? He had a readymade rally around the flag moment in 2020 with COVID, and it was actually happening there for a few weeks, but he squandered it because Trump is Trump. His tariffs and immigration policies are wildly unpopular, so, with his first big and critical moves, he's turned the public against him more if he had just left Biden's policies in place and sat behind the Resolute Desk and watched *Bloodsport* on Blu Ray all day long.

"Agree completely.      and all  those other countries still have living experience of coup attempts , or being under a dictatorship. So the power centres and the public that are firmly anti-dictatorship/dont want to return to a dictatorship had an immune system reaction, making them  react swiftly    eg. the Brazilian courts and the Bolsonaro coup.    Or the South Korean public and Parliament mobilising at light speed to block the 2025 coup, which caused hesitation and fracture in the police and military leadership     I was very surprised that in jan and feb 2025, there was not a mass of court battles about what dodgy was doing to the USA Federal bureaucracy. that this only started happening in mid March 2025",ProfessorUnhappy5997,2025-04-27T02:11:48,2

The electoral college is designed to strengthen the votes of some Americans and dilute others. A Wyoming-ite has about 3x the voting power a Californian has.

"Trumpism doesn’t end with Trump. That old quote from Goldwater about the preachers getting control is going to be a terrible damn problem — Trump is just the vessel for that. They’ve been trying for *decades* to remake America. Now they have a chance to do it and the flouting of laws and the Constitution to get there is just being allowed to happen.   The worst part? This could’ve all been prevented. Trump barked loudly about all the crazy shit he wanted to do for years *after* he started an insurrection when he lost. But apparently, none of that mattered to the electorate of this country. The Democrats and Joe Biden are certainly partially to blame, but the electorate had the option to not vote for what we are seeing unfold. It wasn’t unclear. It wasn’t hidden. It was on TV and Facebook and Twitter. So between the spineless politicians, the crumbling institutions, the destroyed global reputation, and the electorate’s insane dive into not giving a fuck, I don’t have a lot of hope for the near future. We’re basically on Volume III of *History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*.",brainkandy87,2025-04-27T01:01:50,12

What FDR did was awful that said it's a bit different from what Trump is doing.  Imagine if every immigrant was between zero and two generations from literally worshipping as god a figure who had declared war on your country.  That's what FDR was facing with Japanese Americans.  The biggest reason the bombs were dropped instead of a land invasion was because every single step would have been soaked in blood if the Emperor didn't surrender.
