"This so clearly affects women WAY MORE than it affects men.  They know who their potential rules will affect more before they implement them, it's literally their job to play politics.  I tell other woman I talk to now about the SAVE act, & to please make sure all your documents are updated & match. I'll probably never have to tell this to a man though, men don't really change their last name getting married... or have to go into protective custody, & change their identity, to get away from a dangerous ex.",Succubus-Love,2025-04-24T12:25:06,7
