"Minister of Propaganda Barbie: ""But I would also ask, Leslie, and those in the media, what is the alternative?"" she said. ""We continue to be ripped off by the rest of the world, and we just continue down this path.""  This drives me crazy.  She knows it's bullshit, she cannot be that stupid.    A trade deficit with other countries does not mean we are being ripped off. A trade deficit with other countries does not mean we are being ripped off.

I know it’s pretty much nothing but the leak comes before the flood. I take any active acknowledgement from the cult that he’s not infallible as a positive sign.,irrelevantanonymous,2025-04-13T14:45:56,8

"Exactly.  Fox is evil.  So, for example, if we buy $10K of lawn furniture hand woven from palm fronds on some remote pacific island, are we being ripped off?  No, we traded money for goods.  Should we be pissed that they aren't buying gas turbine engines from us?  No, they can barely afford shoes.  This ""We continue to be ripped off by the rest of the world"" line is batshit crazy. Yet Trump's entire tariff strategy is based on it.  The formula he's using to calculate the level of tariffs to apply is a theoretical calculation of the level needed to zero out the trade deficit.  (and he's screwed that up too.. His input values are off by a factor of 4.)  To make it even weirder, his legal justification for having the power to levy tariffs has nothing to do with trade at all.  The law he cites gives Presidents broad powers to deal with national emergencies.  The  national emergency he's claiming is fentanyl, not trade imbalance.  So WTF does starting a trade war have to do with ending the fentanyl epidemic in the USA?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  So legally he's off in la-la land.  It's impeachable.   Yet these news barbies are fully bought in to the crazy.  WTF do people even listen to them?",guttanzer,2025-04-13T23:25:53,12
