"*From Bloomberg News reporter Dana Hull and Kurt Wagner:*  Elon Musk bounded into Washington as a special government employee earlier this year. Gaining unprecedented access to the corridors of power and data, the billionaire injected a sense of chaos across the US government. He joined President Donald Trump’s meetings with foreign leaders and Cabinet Secretaries, weighed in on defense and tariff policies, and most notably, gutted dozens of agencies as the public face of DOGE.  During Musk’s tumultuous run, his private companies — SpaceX, brain implant venture Neuralink and AI startup XAI — have benefited from new funding, while the value of debt taken on when he converted Twitter into privately owned X soared.  But it was Tesla Inc., Musk’s only publicly traded company and a big source of his wealth, that bore the brunt of the public anger against him and his policies. Tesla’s stock dropped 33% since inauguration. The EV maker’s sales plummeted.  In terms of Musk’s personal wealth, the alliance with Trump has so far cost him $113 billion, with his fortune tumbling 25% since Jan. 17, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

"7-10 years ago I was saying “the kids are alright” referring to GenZ.  But I would later realize that the only GenZ people I knew were my nephews, Greta Thunberg, and the parkland students.  I have since become massively disappointed by GenZ who are politically ambivalent, socially disconnected and culturally regressive (although the last one isn’t really their fault).  I also realize that 20 years ago people were saying the same thing about my generation and millennials, I would concede, have been pretty disappointing as well.  I don’t think we can rely on generational cohorts to swing a certain way, since they overwhelmingly are a product of their time and place rather than an independent social movement in their own respect.  I have one niece who is Gen alpha and she is *fucked up* (sounds harsh but I don’t know how else to say it, she has my sister at her wits end and refuses to go to school, constantly threatens self-harm, is on a cocktail of drugs, the kid is fucking 10 years old this makes no sense)",hymen_destroyer,2025-04-29T12:28:26,17
