To band it's the EPA that sets and enforces nationwide standards for maximum allowable fluoridation levels via Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. Not the The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that deals with infectious diseases as the name would imply.,DangerousRoutine1678,2025-04-07T19:10:34,1

"I think the guy is a fucking idiot.  The studies about fluoride and toxicity do warrant a second look.  I’m not saying it needs banned.  I’m saying that if he wants to do ACTUAL research on this topic, I’m not opposed.  I’m not saying he won’t hire someone who ignores the scientific method/evidence to get the results he wants.  I am honestly shocked that he was encouraging the MMR vaccine yesterday.  I also think he was a real force for good as an environmental lawyer, up until a few years ago when he started believing vaccine theories.    Him wanting to get the US on the same level, as far as banned chemicals from foods, as the EU standards is also OK with me.  For anyone wanting to downvote me for saying anything positive about this sentient brain worm, [here is a link to the metadata analysis of fluoride studies done over the past few decades.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7261729/)",classless_classic,2025-04-07T18:31:39,1
"Sorry, but I don't want fluoride in my water...I just want water. Anyone concerned with cavities needs to brush their teeth with toothpaste. Even a small child can adapt to teeth brushing. My liberal West Coast city does not have fluoride in our water and people don't seem to be having a problem with that.  Also, where is the data on fluoride for pets. Can pets drink fluoride?   I do not care for RFK, however, I agree with his decision.",RealisticForYou,2025-04-07T19:00:25,1

Anything in excess quantity can be lethal. Water itself can be lethal.   The amount of fluoride in drinking water is nowhere near what it takes to be negatively affected by it.,Greenman8907,2025-04-07T18:50:05,1
