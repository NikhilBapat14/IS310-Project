"Classic cluster B personality disorder-like behavior.  The hallmark of cluster B is constructing your own personal reality, which they vehemently believe and defend.  Cluster B thrives on propping up an enemy as an outlet for their vitriol.  Cluster B is also blameless, and said enemy serves as a focal point for blame.  You’ll be most familiar with malignant and covert narcissistic types.  Covert overlaps with Borderline, but here’s where they differ.  Borderline is more a deep black hole of need that inspires them to hurt themselves when exposed.  Or if relationships don’t work.  Or to manipulate.  This is how the cluster B borderline type is often exposed and thus finds treatment, harm to self puts them into the care of mental health professionals.  Narcissistic types aim all that energy outward to gaslight, break down, destroy.  But since this vitriol is rarely homicidal, they do not end up in the care of mental health professionals.  Nor do they seek help from mental health professionals, that would require admitting to having a problem.  There are entire subs on Reddit devoted to people who’ve gone no contact with a narcissistic personality disorder in their lives.

"He paid a guy to write art of the deal, and that book deal was a poorly made deal",No_Anxiety285,2025-04-23T12:52:49,134
"The best summation of Trump's style I've seen comes from negotiation lawyer and teacher David Honig:  “I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations.  Okay, here goes.  Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”  Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.  The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.  The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.  One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.  So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.  Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.  Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.  For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.  Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.  From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”  — David Honig",biscuitarse,2025-04-23T13:16:29,110

Obviously, he is now learning the hard way again that there is a lot more to it than that.

"That's called an asshole tax, he might not have these kinds of issues of having to pay a premium if he just paid what he owed. I hope they get some lawyer on it, tell them they can keep 75% of the proceeds there is probably a lawyer who you then don't have to pay.",Aggressive-Neck-3921,2025-04-24T07:19:29,9

"I hope so too, but I have doubts. They aren't the ones being bombed. Not yet, at least - I guess we'll all find out later where this trump presidency ends up.   It was a tiktok fad they got swept up in. And it helped excuse whatever other reasons they had for not supporting the Harris/Walz ticket. I'm not on the same social media feeds as that crowd. I don't know if they'll put two and two together about the trump administration and any personal consequences they suffer from our decline into stupidity-fueled authoritarianism.",underpants-gnome,2025-04-24T10:06:44,1
"Trump offered him $250k up front, plus a shared credit, plus 50% of the royalties, forever.  The guy was an experienced ghost writer. A normal ‘celebrity’ book at the time would have been $25 - 100k. Occasionally some royalties, 5-10%, for the first year, maybe two, as an incentive. Ghost writers never expect and would pretty much never ask for, any credit, mention or acknowledgement.  As usual, Trump took no advice and made a monumentally terrible deal. For his book, ‘The Art of the Deal.’",AINonsense,2025-04-24T03:05:41,14
