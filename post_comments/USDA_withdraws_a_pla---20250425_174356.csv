Who in the right mind will be willing to import American agriculture products? The Chinese were smart when they stopped buying pork from America. I wonder who is next? Canada? Mexico? Both countries import chicken from us.,xibeno9261,2025-04-25T21:00:54,5

"What did Trumps trade tzar say in that hearing? Something along the line of: ""Australia won't buy our beef or dairy"" Gee, I wonder why?  As a Canadian I actively avoided many US agriculture products even before Trump got elected for a second time, because I just don't trust their regulators and producers to do their effing job!",BadgerinAPuddle,2025-04-25T19:15:34,2

"I've already decided to switch to oat milk because the USDA has stopped inspecting dairy facilities. I can't eat red meat because of an allergy, and now this. I guess it's time to officially go Vegan.",duct_tape_jedi,2025-04-26T01:08:45,6

"He wants to take us back to a pre-1913 economy, so that means pre-1913 food safety standards  And child labor laws, lack of restrictions on pollution, treatment of women and minorities, lack of disease prevention, levels of government corruptionâ€¦  In fact, as far as I can tell, the only thing he *doesnâ€™t* like about the Gilded Age is all the libraries and museums and universities that the robber barons founded and funded.  And the plentiful and convenient public transportation of course.",specqq,2025-04-26T03:36:43,2
"Canadians are already leaving American products on the shelves.Â  Chicken, produce, canned goods, baked goods....   If you go into a grocery store in Canada right now, you'll see red maple leaves on products letting consumers know at a glance which products are Canadian.   And as a Canadian, if I can't find a Canadian product, I'll buy a substitute from any other country except America.   It's not just the tariffs. I'm doing something I've never done in my life...but I'm not going to risk buying American if US food regulations go into the trash can.",Phoenixlizzie,2025-04-26T02:04:39,4

"There's a lot that isn't made public, and if the elite are set on their goal of lowering the total world population down to only about 50mil, it's going to take some time, and they'll need to do so with various measures, otherwise it'll be too suspicious. Though we should expect to see the plague times get worse, not that they aren't considering RFK Jr. and the anti-vax shitboots.",masterchefguy,2025-04-25T19:25:19,1
