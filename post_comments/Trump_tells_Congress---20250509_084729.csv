"President Donald Trump instructed congressional Republicans this week to raise taxes on the wealthiest earners as part of his “big, beautiful bill,” rattling his party’s brittle consensus on economic issues and muddling the GOP’s path toward enacting his campaign promises.  Congress is working to extend lower rates for individuals from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are set to expire at the end of this year. Trump, in recent conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), said Congress should raise taxes on some of the highest earners, according to two people familiar with the president’s position who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also floated creating a tax bracket for those earning more than $5 million per year.

"But it's funny watching them actively argue against themselves in real time.  They spent 4 years telling me how taxing the wealthy more is a bad thing.  Then in a matter of hours they had to flip back and forth between thinking it's good and bad as their Dear Leader changed his mind on the topic multiple times.  The can't possibly disagree with Dear Leader on any topic, you know because it's a cult.",Richfor3,2025-05-09T09:18:15,6
