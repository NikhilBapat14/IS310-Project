"Is this what ""isolationist"" means? We can't spend money on NarCan for first responders but we can spend it to bomb Mexican cartels. How much innocent collateral damage are they anticipating? Yet another country that won't welcome Americans with open arms.

I don't think so.",invalidpassword,2025-05-03T06:00:15,18
A war against the cartels is an endless mess. The guerrilla warfare would be terrible. There’d be so much collateral damage and attacks on American soil. Plus it wouldn’t make a difference. You could kill the entire leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. But there’ll always be someone to fill in the leadership or another cartel to fill in the void.,LatterTarget7,2025-05-03T08:00:30,7

"This fucking Orange Idiot needs a populist war to get the attention of the dullards who voted for him.   He need to keep their attention off the economy he had cratered, the once strong international relations he has damaged beyond repair, the long cherished laws and dignified history he holds in such contempt as he tears them down with not one notion how to replace or improved them.  He will get American service personnel killed en masse just to keep the American People distracted while he ruins their country.   This will be one of the darkest chapters of American History, the one teachers use as a cautionary tale of unchecked power in the hands of an ignorant and selfish leader.",VainEldritch,2025-05-03T07:27:18,3

">Since Mexican President [Claudia Sheinbaum](https://www.latintimes.com/topics/claudia-sheinbaum) took office, federal forces have adopted a more active law enforcement approach, with the Mexican government having destroyed 758 fentanyl and methamphetamine labs. In addition, the current administration has doubled arms seizures to almost 9,000 in six months. Operación Frontera, Sheinbaum's 10,000-troop response to Trump's pressure to strengthen border control on the Mexican side, has posted similar results, with troops seizing 163kg of fentanyl powder and over 1.13 million fentanyl pills in the first two months.    And Trump risks torpedoing this for a stupid political stunt.  Most Presidents would see the folly of purposefully harming America and Americans for a political stunt, but the tariff fiasco shows that Trump is too fucking stupid to stop himself.",YesterShill,2025-05-03T10:28:32,2

"No.  We are *well past* allowing ""to dumb to see it"" or any form of apologetic language. Anyone claiming to have not known better is willfully complicit. Anyone who was able to but didn't vote is willfully complicit.  The American system has tons of tools in place to have stopped him the first time, and have allowed and are continuing to allow those tools to be ignored or removed. Every day news of another step no one could believe would ever be crossed has resulted in a nothing burger. Maybe a short protest a news article.  America is at the point where people are being taken from the streets, from schools, from hospitals without due process. A decade ago that was one of the things that history taught us was squarely in the bad guys list of cruelty.   America as a nation wants this. Every tool that the American public could have used, they watched them being removed. The public has figuratively, willfully given up their weapons for this kind of fight.

lol you can’t defeat the cartels. You think they’re going to man defensive lines and try and hold choke points against Abrams tanks?

"Fascism is unsustainable.    Characteristics of Fascism:  1. Powerful, often exclusionary, populist nationalism centered on cult of a redemptive, “infallible” leader who never admits mistakes.  2. Political power derived from questioning reality, endorsing myth and rage, and promoting lies.  3. Fixation with perceived national decline, humiliation, or victimhood.  4. White Replacement “Theory” used to show that democratic ideals of freedom and equality are a threat. Oppose any initiatives or institutions that are racially, ethnically, or religiously harmonious.  5. Disdain for human rights while seeking purity and cleansing for those they define as part of the nation.  6. Identification of “enemies”/scapegoats as a unifying cause. Imprison and/or murder opposition and minority group leaders.  7. Supremacy of the military and embrace of paramilitarism in an uneasy, but effective collaboration with traditional elites. Fascists arm people and justify and glorify violence as “redemptive”.  8. Rampant sexism.  9. Control of mass media and undermining “truth”.  10. Obsession with national security, crime and punishment, and fostering a sense of the nation under attack.  11. Religion and government are intertwined.  12. Corporate power is protected and labor power is suppressed.  13. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts not aligned with the fascist narrative.  14. Rampant cronyism and corruption. Loyalty to the leader is paramount and often more important than competence.  15. Fraudulent elections and creation of a one-party state.  16. Often seeking to expand territory through armed conflict.",TintedApostle,2025-05-03T07:22:43,28

"Agree entirely.   But people are also really dumb.     Dumb enough to be easily manipulated.  Dumb enough to be told what they want.     Which is how we got here.   Trump could turn around tomorrow and say that undocumented migrants are doing god's work by taking the shitty low-wage jobs that americans don't want.  That they're keeping us wealthy and keeping our grocery prices down.  That Biden was an idiot for not leveraging this source of cheap labor.     Then his supporters would do a complete 180 without a seconds hesitation.   They have no consistent logic or principles.  They just believe what their propaganda machine shoves down their throats.   Breaking that spell is part of the action needed to right this.  Their support is one of the only things holding this administration back from even worse corruption, criminality and empirialism.",sometimes_rite,2025-05-03T10:03:38,2
