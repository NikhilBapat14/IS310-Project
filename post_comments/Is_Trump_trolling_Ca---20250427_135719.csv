"It's stupid to talk of Canada as a single state within the Union because Nova Scotia itself was already the 14th state candidate along with the 13 original colonies at continental congress in 1774. Anyone with any respect for history - be it Canadian or American - would have to recognize that Canada would NOT go into the Union as a single state. You're looking at a MINIMUM of five separate states, each of which would need a senior and junior senator, and then of course Congress would get loaded up with something the size of California.   But the United States has dramatically different laws compared to here when it comes to limiting liability. Forget the universal healthcare stuff because that's actually closer to some states than the Federal legal code, which is much different. I've seen judgments in the US which go into the hundreds of millions of dollars for relatively stupid things. And then there are sentences for various crimes which are like 100 years in some cases. The US just seems to have borrowed a lot from French civil code, which English Canada reviles deep down.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T21:34:01,2

There is a reason that Canada flipped from a near certain conservative government to a liberal bloodbath,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T18:51:45,1
I won’t pretend to know everything about Canada but from a purely economic standpoint just a few western provinces are self-sufficient in Canada and fund the Eastern ones and the whole of Canada is totally dependent on the US economically and militarily.  The world is changing and Canadas inability to defend or use a huge chunk of its territory without the US is an issue here as well. Most of Canadian population hugs the US border.  I feel like if a democrat said let’s make a North American Union similar to the EU with Mexico Canada and the US it would go over much smother. I think part of the problem is the messenger here.  To me the benefits all around are clear.,Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T21:40:18,-4

"It might have worked in the 1860's but the major sticking point today is Federal law. Canada is a Confederation and our executive branch is a Figurehead. Yours has the ability to make executive orders. They are just very incompatible. The Democrats are usually worse for Canada than Republicans. Usually. Maybe not in the case of Trump though. There can be North American economic union, but again Canada is (other than the slavery part) a lot more like the Confederacy.   What exactly is Canada defending itself from anyhow? Neither the Russians nor the Chinese have ever attacked Canada. Is that coming soon?  The real problem is that neither of us have dealt with the dramatic lopsidedness of trade with China established over the last 40 years and we are all about to get completely screwed by that. We both like cheap stuff made far away and our universities aren't producing anywhere near the number of STEM university grads it will take to compete.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T22:12:02,2
When I see similar acts of resistance against this regime from Americans it warms my heart as well. Hoping to see more of them soon before it's too late.,MixRepresentative819,2025-04-27T19:25:42,2
"I think the argument is, and this isn’t my argument (cause what do I know?), but it seems to make sense to me, if the US didn’t guarantee Canadian sovereignty it wouldn’t exist because it can’t defend the bulk of its territory and someone at some point down the line would take it overtly or covertly as the artic opens.    As for the economics, 80 percent of Canada’s economy is dependent on the US, and while the US does get some benefit from that Canada gets way more benefit.    I think there is a resetting going one because the US has been on neo-liberal autopilot for 50 years and now it is becoming obvious that if the US wants to continue to exist it has to change policy.    I still think the benefits for everyone involved in some kind of combination make a lot of sense because basically we are literally and figuratively tied at the hip anyway.     But this isn’t some ideological thing for me. I am not passionate about it. I just see it as the best outcome in a world that has already changed and we are just waking up to it now.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T22:22:20,-2
"IF the United States left NATO, then Canada would rapidly move toward militarization of its economy. I would personally love that because my skillsets would be in very high demand here as a result. But it would come at a steep cost to the whole country. Chrystia Freeland's seemingly insane arguments about Canada developing its own nuclear weapons wouldn't be so crazy. That would happen quick since Canada has some of the highest supplies of raw materials for it.  What we really need to worry about is guerilla groups forming armed militias. You already have a ton of problems with Mexican cartels infiltrating, and we kind of have that problem to a lesser degree.   What does the future even look like though? I can even imagine joining Canada and the US as far as into the 1980's, but not today. The geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically.   Look, we still have extradition agreements between our two countries and law enforcement works together relatively well. Why spoil all of that with something on paper that has no buy-in from the people?",Gerry235,2025-04-27T22:34:01,1
"And it isn't 80% dependent on the US. That's a hyperbolic figure. I get that it's 75% of exports, but exports don't define the economy. Canada's economy is a lot of internal consumption of its own product.   The United States taking a ham-fisted approach to Canada has riled up everybody, even people like me who are/were Republican-leaning. If the United States wants to rejoin the British commonwealth then maybe there is potential for something.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T22:38:38,1
"I think the point is that Canadian economy/welfare system is highly dependent on the US, but there may be substitutes for that.  Nukes are pointless because the second you use them it’s game over for you.  This is really about the Arctic and hemispheric defense. The Use it or Lose it policy is very much correct. And Canada simply isn’t equipped to use it or defend it.—  There are just long term shifts at play that will beg the US and Canada to form some kind of union. If it doesn’t happen eventually both of them will lose.  But whatever. I really don’t have a horse in the race. I am just thinking of this in terms of like a table top exercise macro view.  I know others are very passionate about it and I don’t want to ruffle nationalistic feathers.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T22:45:44,1
"There is already an economic (and even military) union without a political one. What does the United States want? To build a base in Canada's northern arctic territory? I cant see why Ottawa would deny that kind of thing.  Now, is there a SHIFT in Canada toward international law that destabilizes the historical bilateral relationship between Canada and the US? Makes it more difficult for the US and Canada to get along as well as they have in the past? THAT would be a serious problem and I would 100% support any effort to reconstitute our bilateral relationship at the expense of international law.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T22:55:16,1
"Also keep in mind that Justin Trudeau was a total clown, and when he told your president that Canada couldn't survive without the existing trade relationship with the US, he was being the typical pansy that he is (and that the Liberals are).  We will not lose to the rest of the world. We just need much stronger leaders to deal with the attacks that are coming our way. We can do it together as separate countries which would respect history and not play into the schemes of our far away geopolitical enemies.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T23:00:27,0
"I think the point from an American perspective is, and this doesn’t just apply to Canada, we simply can’t afford to defend the whole world and have massive trade imbalances at the same time. It’s not sustainable.    So back to Canada, why should the US militarize the Arctic to defend a Canadian northwest passage and other emerging artic goodies?   Maybe there is a new world order that will respect the Canadian Artic. But it will be controlled by China shipping and patrolled by Russian boats.  Who knows what that would mean for Canadian politics?   To me the best bet is some kind of combination that is fair to both sides. That’s what the US really wants.  We don’t want 30 Canadian senators. Or a 51 state. Trump is doing a really awkward job of pitching the vision…Haha but to me it seems to need to happen in some form.  And Canada simply can’t fund the Use it or Lose it policy.  Because before you get the goodies (which are decades away from being viable) you have to defend the territory.  And Canada isn’t in a position to do that without massive US investment.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T23:01:42,1
"I think that is ultimately what the US wants.  Trump is a manifestation of the fact that the US isn’t a lone super power anymore, the Cold War is over, WWii Europe is no longer helpless, China doesn’t play fair, we took our position for granted and the whole world got used to taking advantage of our attitude. We need hemispheric defense from Panama to the Arctic and we can’t afford to be the world’s dumping ground for all their imports and play the world’s military role.   So ultimately the US wants a deal that provides hemispheric defense and changes global trade imbalances while securing supply chains.  Canada stands to benefit from that and this 51st state talk is just Trump pounding the table because it needs to be reordered from our perspective. We still have the cards to make it happen. We can’t wait decades to wake up to the issues at hand.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T23:25:05,1
"I can appreciate that the United States wants the northwest passage for economic opportunities, and I can imagine decent partnerships to be made up there between Canada and the US.  If we join countries on paper then we are just showing weakness to everyone else you mentioned. That is how I see it.  The trade imbalance with Canada is because of Canada's oil and gas. Otherwise it is about 350 billion a piece. Which is enormous but fair and balanced. Those oil and gas companies have plenty of American shareholders who profit from their operations, too.  No, the United States cannot afford to keep defending the world with imbalanced trade, but look very closely at the numbers - it is NOT Canada. You can start a business in Canada, buy homes here, etc. You cant do any of that in China. So I agree with you.  We SHOULD all be scared because I've seen humanoid robots mass produced under $10K coming out of China in the last year. And their artificial intelligence is growing by leaps and bounds. It's coming fast and hard, and they are winning over the rest of the world very quickly with more carrot than stick.",Gerry235,2025-04-27T23:16:06,2
"Blackberry Canada sold exactly THREE blackberry handheld phones to China. Several hundred million to Indonesia, etc. Why? Well I think we all know why. And guess what they did with them in China? They reverse-engineered the shit out of them.   We've all been burying our heads in the sand for too long. We gave giant companies full license to go over there and they saw the money and forgot about the long term consequences. We have NO leadership, which has a lot to do with the failure of our religious institutions, but that's a whole other story.  People voted for Trump because they are angry at something that could have been prevented all along. I saw him on Oprah in 1987. He had a point then. Canada lost Nortel to China, then Blackberry. Real companies with real vision. I feel like this response is a little too late when we needed it fifteen or twenty years ago, so it makes me a bit angry",Gerry235,2025-04-27T23:32:45,1
"Re: war robots. Exactly. And what is needed to outproduce them, when they actual are ready for prime time, happens to lie under the ice in Arctic.  This is about bringing back manufacturing capacity and rare earth. Trump lashed out at Canada because they don’t provide for their own defense. He wants Canada to realize that so that a favorable deal can be made.  Maybe it is stupid, maybe it wakes everyone up, maybe we all need to stare into the abyss before coming to the table.  That is what this is all about. Trump might not be the guy to solve it, but it needed shaking up.  This is the shake up. When the table reorders the US and Canada will still be side by side. Canada will be a junior partner though because that’s just the way power dynamics and spheres of influence work.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-27T23:41:46,1
100 percent agree. Canada would do well to follow emerging US trade policy re:China.  I think a new treaty will be good for both sides and solve a lot of needs for both countries. This 51st state thing was just a necessary step to get us talking the right way.,Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-28T00:10:27,1
"Canada will have about as much influence in DC as California does, if that. Canada is just a separate country. Yes Canada needs a much stronger military industrial complex - I 100% agree. Our companies have been getting destroyed by China, sadly.  Trump's instincts are as a NYC real estate mogul. He's not a geopolitical expert, which is what we all need. The Chinese are playing four dimensional chess",Gerry235,2025-04-27T23:48:32,2
"Not really. China has some major problems too. For instance they banned Rare Earth exports to the us. Bad for us, right? No not really. Refining rare earth isn’t hard. The tech has been around since the 50’s. The problem is China destroys other countries capacities by dumping cheap (state subsidized) refined rare earth wiping out the refiners that were here. Anytime someone else tried to build one they would just dump more. That’s why the control 90 percent of refined rare earth. So now they banned the export. Great we can finally invest in refiners.  This is just one example.  The 4D chess saying is just Russia and Chinese propaganda seeping into our free press. They have massive debts, zombie infrastructure, corruption, etc. they just got really good at gaming our system and our leaders arrogantly believed it didn’t matter. They aren’t playing 4D chess. They joined the WTO and then broke every rule.  So now that is changing and it feels scary and people are screaming and propaganda is everywhere. But the free world and the free markets still have the advantage. We just need to change the way we act, adapt, and stay around to play our winning hand.  A future, and hopefully arriving soon, US Canadian treaty will help both sides and Canadian sovereignty will be just fine.",Unique-Wasabi3613,2025-04-28T00:05:02,2
