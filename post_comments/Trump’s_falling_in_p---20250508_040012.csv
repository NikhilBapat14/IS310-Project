"The Democrats problem is that they are the status quo in a time that demands actually delivering on their promises.  And now we know radical systemic change is allowed when you're the executive in the new American political reality.  The economy is not and has not been good for most Americans in years but the donors are doing fantastic.  And yeah, the Republican donors are doing great too but when you offer policies or a circus that gets the base behind you things are even better.  Democrats have been sliding right for a generation.  New ideas are needed.",PlanktonUnusual328,2025-05-08T04:37:47,26

"Because breaking everything by denying funds and appointing people to destroy the agency they lead is easy while picking up those thousands of pieces and putting them back together is time consuming and frequently impossible.  So both sides are bad becomes the mantra.  MAGA destroys, the Democrats are unable to stop the destruction and put everything back together.",thingsorfreedom,2025-05-08T05:33:42,7
"From afar, it's because the Democrats do not have a clear leader and a clearly articulated policy platform to oppose Trump. In politics, disunity is death. Until such time as they unite behind a leadership team with a coherent policy platform and consistent messaging, they will fail to gain traction.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-05-08T04:09:31,16

Right now we’re back to a Trump story coming out every 10 seconds that’s more outrageous than the next. Click bait on top of click bait. It’s a conditioning that works because it plays into human psychology and emotions. Figure out a way to penetrate that.

"As I see the Democrats problem is they say that Government works . I would point to the failure to complete the rail project in California . When the Liberals win they pass every single rule to improve the process , but nothing gets done. On  other hand the conservatives want government to fail . So no police , no firefighters, unsafe air travel no disaster relief . The working class has seen their lifestyle erode , so for them government doesn’t work so they are more inclined to vote Republican. Balance and compromise are the key . We have to convince them we are in their corner . Raising the minimum wage to something more livable is a good start. Trumps tariffs are entirely regressive, disproportionately affecting the poorest .",Adept-Procedure4555,2025-05-08T08:50:10,1

"The problem with that is that such radical change is only allowed insofar that the ones currently doing it believe that the bill will never come due. A lot of that change is just blatantly illegal stuff that, if there other were to be investigations and such, would probably find a lot of guilt and punish it.   The current administration just does it anyway because they are reasonably sure that will never happen to them.  Democrats, in the meantime, still want a system of checks and balances. Even if there was a successful election right now where dems win and get Trump to vacate the spot, they would still be constrained by the other branches.  The real reason why dems can't benefit from Trump falling in popularity is because Trump no longer needs it to get to do what he wants. Sure, he still yearns for it because narcissist, but that man clearly does not believe that he will have to relinquish that power for any reason again.",Independent-Wave-744,2025-05-08T07:48:53,3

"Lol i appreciate the spirit of this eloquently worded response.   I like to point to the graphs of vote totals for election years. Republicans basically perform the same, with vote totals going up with population increase.   Democrats lost like 10 million votes this election. They didnt go to trump, they just didnt vote this time. Even knowing that Trump could win again, they decided that was better than going out to vote to make sure it didnt happen. But it's not democrats fault. It's those Republicans voting for the same people they always vote for, or the sexists that didnt want a woman president, or the racists that didnt want a black president ect. They can't say ""wow we are really screwing up here, this is our fault, what can we change to inspire people to vote for us again.""
