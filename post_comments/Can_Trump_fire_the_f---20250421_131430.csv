"I'm sure this will get downvoted by the brigaders but here it goes:  Trump is right and you'll all hate him for it. There is absolutely extremely high value in having the Fed disconnected from politics. But I think there's reasonable reason that in this case, it would be better if Powell tried to equally weight his duel mission of keeping inflation and unemployment low, rather than er so far on trying to reign in inflation. I think it's also just as reasonable to believe that he's making an error just as much because he doesn't want to make the same mistake twice as it is that he just personally detests Trump.  Powell made a serious error under Biden when he didn't raise rates sooner and faster. The way that raising rates curbs inflation is by making investment more expensive and driving up rates and making savings more attractive. It pumps the brakes on the economy. For an economy that had just taken some serious steroids in the form of repeated and overdone stimulus, it's exactly what was needed. Powell instead waited and the government broadly announced that they thought that inflation was transitory. What a stupid thing to think. Hindsight is 20/20, but we didn't foresight in the years that followed COVID. Given the nature of the driving factor in inflation, it would have made complete sense to be more aggressive.  That's completely different here. There's no stimulus that's driving inflation. Instead, we have tariffs driving up input costs. This will, of course, actually be transitory. The Fed / Powell has said that they specifically don't want to cause further inflation that may be sparked by tariffs. This is incredibly stupid. Here's why: inflation begets inflation when higher prices lead to higher profits, which leads to higher investment which leads to higher wages, which supports being able to pay higher prices. Except in this case, higher prices are caused by tariffs. Those higher prices will not cause higher profits. Instead, the government will take the excess price and, given DOGE, it will simultaneously cut spending. Here money is literally being taken out of the economy. We're practically back to 1928 and the Fed is announcing that they're too afraid of inflation to let there be loose monetary policy if things go south. And to be clear, it would be loose monetary policy exactly at a time when total money is going to dry up. It's stupid.  Trump is right to want to replace Powell. Powell is going to cut the political legs out of our ability to utilize tariffs. And it's hard for me to believe that Powell isn't at least a little biased here. Why hold off on aggressively fighting inflation under Biden when it would have made sense too, and then push to fight inflation now, when it would actually make more sense to be more willing to fight unemployment.",_whydah_,2025-04-22T00:50:36,-16
"1: Fed Chair is only for 4 years   2: If there is cause then yes he can replace the Chair.  Not up to me to define what cause is nor is it up to anyone who isn't an elected official.

"Considering that the federal reserve is questionable in even being constitutional and has always been very political in the models that they support, it really doesn't matter.   My personal opinion is to ignore them and audit them. Also get rid of the Federal reserve note and go back to a constitutional based Treasury issued note. Which would screw the federal reserve and destroy the value of the massive amount of bad money that is in foreign markets.",MJM-TCW,2025-04-21T15:56:38,-73
"Fire him for cause.  It is impossible for Powell to explain why he lowered rates going into the election AND refuses to lower rates now when inflation if markedly lower and recession is a threat.  That’s a blatant political hack in action for all to see.  Add to that is comment about clarity over tariffs, taxes, and immigration.  Bullshit!  That is none of the fed’s concern.  Their mission is to stabilize employment and keep inflation low and that’s it.",cchris_39,2025-04-21T15:26:18,-158

"> Isn't the whole point of the Fed to keep inflation down?  First off, that's not entirely true. It is just that most recently high inflation has been the bigger issue with USD stability. The Fed would also intervene to stop deflation if it became the larger issue.  Current Situation: The average U.S. dollar inflation rate in 2025, based on available Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from January to March, is approximately 2.5%.  The Fed targets 2% inflation, so they do not actually want the current trend of decreasing inflation to reverse yet. In December of '08 when the Fed intervened to slash interest rates to 0-0.25% the USD had -0.3% inflation (dollar was in deflation). It is likely to expect that they will wait at least until inflation hits 0% before significant rate cuts will come.",Literary_Addict,2025-04-21T16:27:31,50

"The independence of the Fed is the bedrock of our economic standing, and the foundation of the USD as the world's reserve currency.  See Turkey and Venezuela for what happens when this comes under political control. The Fed is not supposed to be determined by the approach of the politician in power. Trump's appointment of Powell is as involved as he's supposed to be.  For those of us concerned about the national debt / deficit...    The fundamental reason we've been able to stave off the consequences of the national debt is because the world has trusted our bond market and the reliability of the USD. I cannot express enough how profoundly bad it would get for us if confidence in the reliability of the USD is shaken enough for other economies to look elsewhere.",hearing_anon,2025-04-21T15:44:28,872

I honestly would rather the fed just be disbanded. They've done nothing right in the 112 years they've been in existence aside from managing the decline of the monetary system,-DizzyPanda-,2025-04-21T17:27:17,-51
"I've never understood the libertarian attitude towards the fed, even though I myself lean much more strongly libertarian than i do mainstream conservative.  To me, monetary policy needs to be independent of politics, and the goal of it needs to be stability; anything else seems lunacy. A lot of libertarians seem to hold to outdated ideals such as wanting to return to a precious metal standard, and this belief then drives blanket hostility towards the fed. There is a reason that metal-backed currencies have never caught on as an exchange medium: the currency supply does not and cannot scale with the economy the way a fiat currency with a reserve banking system can. The reserve banking system is an innovation that allows for a better means of regulating the currency supply and it is, IMHO, in all ways superior.  If people want to be ""more libertarian"", I think a better path is the facilitating of alternate currency or community currency, independent of the government...perhaps moving to the point that there are multiple, competing currencies in use, with rates allowed to float against each other. This is happening a little bit with bitcoin, but bitcoin isn't stable enough to really compete with the USD as a medium of exchange.  I think we could make some legal reforms to facilitate the creation or adoption of alternate currencies that would be like this, and that might be a step in a libertarian direction. Current law in the US is, IMHO a bit too restrictive on alternate currency, although not as much as in some of the EU countries. (Germany has particularly harsh laws.)",cazort2,2025-04-26T16:34:09,1

"This is mostly right, but you're definitely lying to yourself if you're giving any lip-service at all to the independence of the fed. They have a revolving door problem with the Treasury. Nobody serious believes they are an independent body at this point. But it is a comfortable lie to believe, I will say that.  Trump is still wrong despite this. Powell should have been fired due to his handling of the 2021-2023 inflation spiral. He and Yellen are the two most responsible reason for the dollar losing 30% of it's value over the course of three years. But his mess up was not *raising* rates and encouraging the mass purchase of corporate bonds to drive up the money supply. Exactly the opposite of what Trump is complaining about him for.  Inflation is finally getting back to normal. March's numbers were 2.6 down from the expected 2.8 and the 2.9 we saw in Feb.

"^ This. Part of the stability of the US dollar and US economy, and thus the success of our economy, is due to the separation of our monetary policy from political forces. The Fed, and thus its short-to-moderate-term monetary policy, is largely independent from the rest of government, and I wouldn't ever want it to change.  I know a lot of folks are gonna scream ""deep state"" but here's the thing, this is a point where having ""unaccountable bureaucrats"" is actually good. Yes, it's very important to have scrutiny when selecting, appointing, and approving people to chair the fed, but...beyond that it needs to be hands-off. And the criteria for removing/replacing someone needs to be ""this person is incompetent at keeping the rate of inflation stable"", not ""I don't like the effect monetary policy is having on the economy.""  And if you want an example of what can go wrong with bad monetary policy, look at Argentina. [This graph shows how they fared 2018-25](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgraphics.reuters.com%2FARGENTINA-INFLATION%2Fqmyvmdzmjpr%2Fchart.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=bc19aa680919c0d282fc2fc8aaf175f6d59702d69ba64b551ba70738c07c2675), [source](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-inflation-dips-locals-dare-hope-worst-is-over-2024-12-11/). They've done so many no-no's, from refusing to allow their currency to float until 1991, to having a crazily-over-expansionistic policy (i.e. printing too much money) from 2003-2007. And then they have enacted currency controls again since then, so their rate doesn't truly float. And I really think it was monetary policy, not fiscal policy, that drove that. Their fiscal policy has often been relatively tight, in large part forced by their weaker economy and the fact that they can't easily borrow money the way the US can.",cazort2,2025-04-26T16:20:48,1

It's *good* that congress isn't just rubber stamping appointees anymore when the bench itself clearly stopped living up to the standard of impartiality that rubber stamp was predicated on. If we quit pretending to pearl clutch every time a president tries to persuade the central bank to go with his (in this case bad) fiscal policy, maybe we can quit naively pretending these people are unbiased and competent stewards as they clearly are not.
