"The interesting thing about the American Revolution is that it was a limited revolution, in a sense it was conservative. That's because the founders weren't looking to completely upend society and start over blank-slate style like the French and Russian Revolutions. They were merely trying to restore what they deemed were the ancient rights of Englishmen, going back centuries. The English Common Law and Parliamentary Rule were traditions that came from England; the King had denied those customs and his rule became arbitrary and corrupt. The founders kept many ancient English traditions, got rid of the monarch, and were even guided by Greek, Roman, and Hebrew tradition. The Bill of Rights, Constitution, and Declaration were anything but arbitrary. They thought really hard about this stuff and didnt throw caution to the wind.   The American Revolution was also conservative (small-c) because it was neither utopian or all-encompassing like later socialist revolutions. They wanted to keep the central govt small (some wanted a reaaallly small gov), leave decisions to local governments/states, or the people themselves, and let the best practices bubble up from below instead of top-down decree. Tocqueville covers a lot of this in his ""Democracy in America"" as he reflected on the unique character of the American Republic after the French Revolution went batshit crazy.",milton1775,2025-05-08T15:35:16,11
"While this sounds good, there was still over 10 years we were rebelling and fighting against the taxes and other oppressions.  The Son's Of Liberty were formed in 1765 and had been harassing the British.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T16:02:37,2
"Agreed on this. The French Revolution literally went nuts and actually didn’t end up creating a much better society, instead leading to near-anarchy, before Napoleon, in his own bloody reign, managed to wrestle it back to order, though he also ended up a tyrannical monster himself, invading Europe.   Their revolution basically ensured France didn’t really know true peace as a nation until the later 1800s not long before WWI broke out and later WWII. After which they then essentially became the republic we know today.   Even today they get rocked with protests and turmoil all over the place. Like the joke saying goes: “the French like to protest everything”.",ITrCool,2025-05-08T15:47:54,7
