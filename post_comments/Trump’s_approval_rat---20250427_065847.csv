"Please post the full demographics and methodology used for this poll.  Until then I will not care about it, as many ""polls"" in the last few years have been 1000 to 5000 people, all in the same state, in some cases in the same city, that then get touted as ""THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HATES THIS"" or ""THE ENTIRE COUNTRY LOVES THIS"" and those who do it then cry when we point out we have 150,000,000 registered voters (about) and they polled less than 1 percent in one location.  For comparison 15% of just registered voters in the US is 22,500,000 (22 million, 500 thousand) and they poll 10 to 20 thousand at the high end, and usually far far far less.  You want a poll that is valid?  You need the same number of people polled in every state, and in each state go to cities, small towns, rural people.  Get as wide a demographic as possible.  Next, don't stand and verbally ask questions, as that puts in a bias no matter how hard you try not to let that happen.  The best is to have questions that are as basic as possible ""What is your opinion on the current administration"" is far better than ""Do you love or Hate Trump"" which adds in a bias even if small.  Once the questions are as neutral as possible, have the responding people first verify they are an adult, a citizen, and a registered voter, then hand them a form, which that person then seals in an envelope and drops in a box.  Have all forms read by a computer without AI being used, and collate all answers.  But that's not how people want to do it, so they don't, and they always get very triggered when you say ""so less than 1% of Californians (or New Yorkers, or Washingtonians) disapprove, and that's ""the entire US,"" really?  Finally, I know some will scream and yell that the poll is ""absolutely perfectly run and valid and I'm not allowed to question it.""  Please do, as that simply proves you are supporting rigged opinion polls and thus, no one I will spend time on.",tterevelytnom,2025-04-27T16:24:13,-3

The economy would have hummed along at like +2.5%+3%, continued record employment, profits, stocks, etc. And despite structural issues with our economy (e.g. inequality, costs of housing, healthcare, education etc), he could have just sat back and declared it the best economy ever...a lie, but he'd probably be at 51-53% approval, which is decent in modern times, and he could have rode off into the sunset, and probably continued Republican majorities for a decade or maybe longer.

Her predecessor was widely considered to be the best executive director the organization had ever had, and was far better at her job than the new one was.  As a result, the new Executive Director made a very clear and obvious decision, that if she couldn't be the best Executive Director the organization had, she would damn well be the last one it had.

This graph also shows that he has his highest approval ratings among Republicans when right wing media are 100% behind him (when he won the presidency, and when they realized he was going to be the candidate again in 2024).

Anyone who paid attention under W Bush would have the same observation.  What that means is when Trump is gone, the problem doesn't go away.  He gets replaced with the next cult leader and the cult carries on as if they never really liked Trump in the first place, just like they did with W.

There are always people like that though.  If the election were today I have no doubt at all Trump would lose.  Even with Harris as the competition.    On top of this many of these kinds of subs and sites dedicated are controlled by people that want to control the narrative.  They are dishonest and will hide fact while promoting lies.  I see it all the time here in my area on the community sub.  The area is heavy leaning MAGA as most of these elderly and poor buy in.  I just give it a skim to see the pulse of the area.  And any Republicans not spewing MAGA lies gets downvoted and reported into oblivion on their post.  This is becoming more common and there are more callouts on it.  Small sub though.  So that alone is not enough to say it is a trend.  Though I have also seen and heard these types of things other places.  And Trump loses that last election but for a couple things well in Democrat control.  Have a primary being a huge one.     The key thing here will be the economy though as we all know.  Things are not going to do well.  The tariffs are already hitting prices and things.  His flipping rhetoric and lying are not helping either.  Here we are just starting to see some shelves are a little more empty and things cost more.  It very well could snowball into a mess.  As people cut spending due to prices it will cost jobs.  Which will mean less spending due to job loses.  Cost more jobs.  The bottom will be when prices are forced down due to much lower demand.       At least Trump is making out well when he goes to his properties with the secret service.  And when he does meetings there.  And charges for the right to talk to him.  His coin.  His merchandise.       I do hope we get one thing out of all this.  The SC should be nominated and voted on by the people every 8 years at least.  If they do not vote with the law they can be removed.  Maybe we can get some on there that will not say the President in immune completely.  And vote on political ideology.

"I disagree -- among Trump's base, racism and xenophobia (and misogyny among men) are the most important issues. Also important is nostalgia for a past that never really existed -- when White men had all the power, women stayed home and wore June Cleaver smocks with high heels, and Black and Brown people were only seen, if al all, in menial support roles.   Another huuuuge related issue is the racist Great Replacement Theory which states that the US will be majority ""minority"" by 2040. Why else would Trump float a $5,000 bribe for women to have a child - when Trump says ""women"" he means White women. That also is a credible explanation for the attack on aid for the poor, both domestic and foreign. Attack health programs that aid the poor (such as Medicaid), and the Black and Brown population increase will slow down.

If ever there comes a time when republicans think trump has lost enough of the base such that they don‚Äôt need to be scared of him anymore, they may actually challenge him and do their part in limiting his influence. A high-approval trump keeps his boot on republicans‚Äô throats. A low-approval trump may not have that power.  That‚Äôs one of the more important stories to follow through this presidency specifically. Presidents have tended to lose influence well before the end of their second term as their respective parties look to move on from them. Presidents are typically pretty much on board with backing away from policy-making and just handling speaking gigs and showing up for important state events (like the Pope‚Äôs funeral).   trump is, of course, cut from the shittiest mold there is so of course he‚Äôs going to angle for as much influence as he can even after he‚Äôs no longer president anymore. He‚Äôs going to expect Vance to commit to upholding his policies and basically being trump 2.0. If Vance wavers, trump will threaten to sink him.

History tells us things getting worse has an equal chance of helping the authoritarian as harming them.   Moreover this punishment theory in general, as researchers finally tackle it in psychologal and sociological studies, has proven far less effective at changing behavior than our intuition makes us think. Even in children, punitive measures are increasingly seen as not just ineffective at stopping bad behavior but often causing more bad behavior. This doesn't change as we age. We have the same tendencies.   Think about jails in Scandinavia. Punishment is such a small part of it. Rehabilitation is most of it. That's the result of research which applies even outside such harsh antisocial behavior as being jail worthy.  As for your junkie theory, unfortunately these people aren't addicts.

Down from 3% (Jan ‚Äò25) to 2.5% (BLS, March ‚Äò25), despite global trade noise. Trump‚Äôs reshoring $5.2T in investments, including $500B for AI (White House, April ‚Äò25). Egg prices? Wholesale‚Äôs down 54% (USDA, March ‚Äò25). Cry ‚Äòdamage,‚Äô but the economy‚Äôs humming. Dow‚Äôs up 2% (WSJ, April ‚Äò25).  2.  Executive Power & Checks: ‚ÄòLimited government‚Äô fan, huh?

Global stability? No new wars, and he‚Äôs brokering Ukraine talks (Capital Economics, April ‚Äò25). Compare that to prior admin‚Äôs Middle East drone fests. ‚ÄòUndermining‚Äô?

Health? Bird flu‚Äôs global, not Trump‚Äôs fault BUT $1B in vaccines and biosecurity, 70 cases, one death (CDC, April ‚Äò25). Compare that to 2020‚Äôs ventilator shortages.

"Hey bud, I had Chat GPT review this:  1. Tariffs & Inflation 	‚Ä¢	True: Inflation ticking down from ~3% to ~2.5% despite tariffs would be impressive. 	‚Ä¢	True but partial: Peterson Institute‚Äôs ~$1,200/year estimate is about right ‚Äî but that‚Äôs still cost on regular families, even if it‚Äôs not catastrophic. 	‚Ä¢	Reshoring claims: $5.2T investment sounds inflated. It‚Äôs probably pledges and projected over years, not $5.2T actively being spent yet. 	‚Ä¢	Dow up 2%: Technically true‚Ä¶ but a 2% stock market rise over a few months isn‚Äôt strong proof the tariffs aren‚Äôt damaging long term.  Verdict: Partly fair, but cherry-picking short-term numbers.  ‚∏ª  2. Executive Power & Checks 	‚Ä¢	True-ish: Trump is using IEEPA (a real 1977 law), and courts/Congress are still operating. 	‚Ä¢	But: 137 Executive Orders in 4 months is extremely aggressive historically, even if courts push back later. 	‚Ä¢	Misleading: Saying ‚Äúchecks still exist‚Äù doesn‚Äôt erase concerns about overreach. Conservatives do worry about presidents ruling by decree regardless of party.  Verdict: Minimizes a real issue, but correct that full dictatorship isn‚Äôt happening.  ‚∏ª  3. Debt & Spending 	‚Ä¢	Debt facts are mostly correct: 	‚Ä¢	National debt is ~$36.56T. 	‚Ä¢	Trump‚Äôs new tax cuts could add ~$5T over 10 years (as projected by Penn Wharton). 	‚Ä¢	Tariffs projected $5.2T is likely overly optimistic ‚Äî that‚Äôs a best case, not guaranteed revenue. 	‚Ä¢	DOGE (‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äù): That‚Äôs real ‚Äî Trump announced a plan to cut waste, but whether it‚Äôs effective is not proven yet.  Verdict: Debt hasn‚Äôt exploded yet, but risks are building. Rebuttal glosses over future fiscal risks.  ‚∏ª  4. Allies & Stability 	‚Ä¢	True: No wars started, NATO still exists, Ukraine talks ongoing. 	‚Ä¢	But: Threatening allies with tariffs does strain relationships ‚Äî even if paused. 	‚Ä¢	Important context: Conservative hawks (Reagan-style) don‚Äôt like cozying up to adversaries or alienating allies.  Verdict: Mixed bag: Good no new wars, but still fair to worry about damage to alliances long-term.  ‚∏ª  5. Crisis Management 	‚Ä¢	True: FEMA reportedly did respond well to Hurricane Helene (per FEMA). 	‚Ä¢	Bird flu response: Sounds solid so far ‚Äî funding, low cases, fast action. 	‚Ä¢	Misleading tone: Saying ‚Äúonly 4 months‚Äù ignores that early mismanagement can snowball. Good start doesn‚Äôt guarantee long-term competence.  Verdict: So far, handled okay, but ‚Äútoo early to declare total success.‚Äù     Important part:  Your rebuttal has receipts for some short-term wins, but is overconfident about how little risk or damage exists long-term.  A smart conservative could accept some wins while still being worried about debt, overreach, and instability down the road.",Aequitas123,2025-04-27T09:42:57,4

"You're a teacher and you're unfamiliar with the idea that an educated adult might be familiar enough with a subject to reject a false claim without needing to read the alleged source material?  Do you need to read all the links on a climate-denial Gish Gallop before you can comfortably reject the argument? I sure don't. I've been there, done that, and I already know with a very high degree of confidence that the denier is either misrepresenting the source material or linking bad sources.  I'm not as familiar with the details of Hitler's rise to power, but CardinalofNYC very well might be. This is a well-studied subject. Refuting a hyperbolic claim point by point is extremely time-consuming, and this is an Internet argument, not an assigned paper; raising a red flag is more than fine.  On reading the linked sources, I can say confidently that they were right to flag the claim: it is in fact *not supported at all* by these two very short pop-history articles. One is about a poet who mentored a young Hitler and seems to have played a major role in shaping his views but died years before he came to power. The other is about Goebbels, who certainly played an integral role in Hitler's ascent, but hardly amounts to a cabal of wealthy financier-puppetmasters - he was a young man from a working-class family who originally joined the Strasserite (socialist) branch of the party before converting *to Hitler's* views on Marxism.",DevilsTrigonometry,2025-04-27T15:09:24,-1
