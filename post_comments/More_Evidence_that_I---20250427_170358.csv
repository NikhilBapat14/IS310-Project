"The counterargument that black Americans skew and therefore invalidate the results is... something. And by ""something"" I mean deeply fucking racist. ",sweet-nlow,2025-04-27T20:12:01,10

"""More Evidence that Immigrants - Including Illegal Ones - Have Much Lower Crime Rates than Natives"" As if evidence has ever mattered to the party of domestic terrorism.",keninsd,2025-04-27T21:55:26,5
Let’s change the word “Natives” to “Americans” in that there title,Riknektar,2025-04-27T17:33:50,21

Yes because they don’t want to draw attention to themselves. They also don’t use public services or vote. I provided them healthcare for several years and they pay in cash.,According-Mention334,2025-04-27T21:22:56,2

"The racist basis for that counterargument really distills down to which groups they think ought to be compared.   The data tables underlying this study and others do show that people from Latin America who are illegally in the U.S. commit crime at higher rates than native-born white Americans.   However, that implies that white people should be the “real American” reference group, that Latin Americans should comprise the “illegal immigrant” comparison, and that’s the relationship that ought to be selectively elevated to spread hateful tropes about immigrants.",Rich_Charity_3160,2025-04-27T21:28:15,6

"If they really wanted crime and average prosperity (i.e. median income) to be the metric of who is a ""real American"", then America should be a country of Asians",AdventurerBKRB,2025-04-28T00:03:13,2
"Right??!! I wonder how many articles they've written arguing otherwise to help the domestic terrorists demonize immigration, asylum policies and the immigrants who we drove to or borders from our fucked dealings with all the nations on this planet.",keninsd,2025-04-27T22:01:08,3
"Probably very few, considering they're libertarian and therefore mostly support open borders.",Karmonit,2025-04-28T06:36:36,1
