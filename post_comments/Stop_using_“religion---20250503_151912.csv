">The United States Supreme Court has taken a case in *Mahmoud v. Taylor* that could possibly continue the psychic disequilibrium that Adrienne Rich raises.  >The case arose from conflicts between teaching LGBTQ+ topics and parents’ rights on religious grounds in the education of their children. The case stems from some parents’ concerns about a policy sanctioned by the Montgomery County Board of Education regarding new elementary school storybooks covering LGBTQ+ topics that can be read in classes.  >One of the contested books, for example, is entitled *Pride Puppy!* about a puppy who got lost in the crowd during an LGBTQ+ Pride parade.   >“When someone with the authority of a teacher describes the world and you are not in it, there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing.” – Adrienne Rich  Growing up (especially in my teens), I felt like a misfit, because everyone else around me was super-sexual, and I was the only one who just wasn't interested in having sex at all. My family even thought I was gay because I never had a girlfriend growing up.  Everyone was wondering what was up with me, because I wasn't prowling for sex like every teenager in some Judd Apatow flick.  I didn't know the term for me. I didn't know what or who I was. Sex-ed wasn't allowed in my school, due to our state being Bible Belt Christian nationalist.  I went through years of anguist and misery because I just didn't belong anywhere, and I didn't fit in with everyone, as all they were interested in was getting some.  It took me until 26 to discover the word asexual, and what asexuality was. When I found out and learned I'm asexual, the weight off my shoulders had been lifted.  No more did I have to feel like I was ""obligated"" to get married and have sex, like every good Christian person is supposed to.  No longer did I feel like I had to fit into rigid ideas of ""masculinity"", where the only way to become a ""real man"" is to have sex.  No longer did I feel like I had no say in my destiny, and that I had no decision but to ""put out"" to make others who only wanted me for sex to be happy.  I spent nearly a decade out of high school feeling depressed, despondent, and full of angst, because I couldn't find out where I belonged in terms of my sexual orientation.   When I finally discovered I'm asexual, it's like a new door opened and a new world became available to me.  I finally felt freedom. I felt joy. I felt happiness. I felt like I finally had a voice as to who I am.  [This is my story on discovering I'm asexual](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/04/finding-out-i-am-asexual-has-helped-me-come-into-my-own/)",southpawFA,2025-05-03T15:29:01,97
"I can think of many things Jesus was very specific about. How wealth is the root of evil, how to treat people with kindness and compassion when society cast them aside, even that a man must honor a divorce with a certificate and not withhold that.  Yet never once did Jesus say anything about being gay, it was around very much in his time. Jesus was very concerned with “saving souls” yet not once did he bring up this issue.

"Banning LGBTQ books because of ""religion"" is the modern day version of the South banning education about racism and equality of the races because Southern Baptists believed black people weren't full humans.  I don't see how people don't see how absurd this shit is. Plenty of Southerners and others today would try the same move with respect to race and mixed race marriages, etc., they'd use religion to justify it if we let them.

Eunuchs, in Roman society *were their cultural equivalent of trans people*. This same sort of cultural phenomena survived antiquity in India into the modern age with the Hijra, who I encourage you to learn more about.

"I am transgender and I understood I was different at around 5 1/2 years old (so back in the 80s) but I had a violent family member threatening me at home. It wasn't safe for me to talk to anyone at home.  Everywhere I heard trans people mentioned it was with insults, hate, and wildly untrue claims of evil and lies that we deserve punishment for existing.  It would have been life changing to know that trans people are none of those bad things and just regular people living our lives and finding happiness in our own way.  I started reading young and since I felt incredibly alienated and alone I spent a lot of time in the school library, started reading clinical psychology books, and eventually had a much better understanding of myself, but I was still being threatened with death at home if my being trans was suspected.  There are many kids like I was, alone, scared, and lied to constantly by prejudiced adults.  It is a good thing to let kids know that being different is okay. That we can all be happy and be good people, despite the many prejudiced people who vehemently claim otherwise.  Also, most kids know that adults like each other from seeing all the straight people around them. There is no difference between knowing a man and a woman care about each other and knowing two women or two men can care about each other in the same way.

It is from principally white, racist Christians that we have the threat of fascism in this country.

And so it speaks of itself as the church militant: the onward Christian soldiers marching, as to war.

"Well I can only speak from my own education on that matter (speaking plainly to avoid a lot of mushy theology speak) but what is important to note that in the Bible Jesus is a form of God just as they say the “Holy Spirit” is so the whole trinity thing. But Jesus was supposed to be just a man, so that God would give himself up as sacrificial for redemption.   Jesus himself points out that he has come to fulfill the law not abolish it. I do think it is worth noting that Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher who was focused on preparing people for salvation. I find it interesting that even with all the things he spoke on never once did being gay pop up from him.   It only comes up twice in the whole of the Bible and it is in the context of people placing extra rules on themselves, what can be drawn from the text as non-consensual acts, and also that the recipient male is making himself like a women and that’s the issue the written has.

In terms of same sex practice there is Old Testament - Leviticus. 22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination  And,  Leviticus 13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.  (Liberals often claim that the mentions homosexual acts in terms that of sexual violence, that is objectively untrue)  Any sex outside of marriage is considered sexual immorality and marriage can only occur between a man and a women. The bible is clear on this (most of us engage in sexual immoral behaviours though myself included)   The New Testament mentions sexual immorality further - Corinthians 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,  And Timothy 10 the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine.  I don’t see how anyone can honestly try to suggest the scripture doesn’t really care about homosexual acts, it clearly does and therefore I  would be wrong for a Christian to engage in behaviours that encourage or promote it in the same way it would be strange for Christian’s to openly promote and encourage any immoral acts.

"True, little kids who don't know any better, forced to go to church and be indoctrinated into the church, when they can't even prove their sky daddy exists. Religion is a poison on a society, and trying to use it to justify ""opt outs"" based on their caveman level beliefs is inhumane.",Ging287,2025-05-03T23:34:47,3
"“As Saint Paul said: “To will is present with me, but how to do that which is good, I find not. For the good that I would, I do not, and the evil that I would not, that I do.” How’re we going to be changed? Obviously, there cannot be a vitality of religion without vital religious experience. And that’s something much more than emoting over singing Onward Christian Soldiers.  what happens in our ecclesiastical goings-on is that we run a talking shop. We pray, we tell god what to do, or give him advice as if he didn’t know. We read the scriptures. And remember—talking of the Bible—Jesus said: “You search the scriptures daily, for in them you think you have life.” Saint Paul made some rather funny references about “the spirit which giveth life and the letter which kills. I think the Bible ought to be ceremoniously and reverently burned every Easter. We need it no more, because the spirit is with us. It’s a dangerous book. And to worship it is, of course, a far more dangerous idolatry than bowing down to images of wood and stone. Because nobody in his senses can confuse a wooden image with god, but you can very easily confuse a set of ideas with god. Because concepts are more rarefied and abstract.”   Text sourced from https://www.organism.earth/library/document/jesus-his-religion)",halfhearinghank,2025-05-04T06:03:51,7
"If you study religion from a broad perspective, it's definately not a good thing. Over the course of history, is has ""been used as a vehicle"" to cause mass death in wars. It's not small numbers either.  I would describe it as ""a technology that was developed to manipulate people into causing mass death through conflict.""  The modern version is more like ""people need to get a real job"" type stuff.  I want to be clear with you: The religious text book is a complete distraction from the concept of organized religion.  I don't have any problems with the contents of the books, that's not what I'm saying. It's ""the behavior part of religion that is the problem."" And not all religions are necessarily a problem. It's the ""chaotic ones"" that are. Again, I am describing the behavior of groups of people here.  Because in reality, religion isn't exactly what people think it is anyways. You are alive right now, so what you think and believe, and what concepts that guide you through life are ""your religion"" whether it's recognized as an official religion or not. People typically view religion from a historical perspective. ""They're doing what the people before them did, with out considering whether that makes any sense right now.""",Actual__Wizard,2025-05-04T00:02:57,0
" Jesus considered the Old Testament to be the Word of God, not just human writings. He referred to Scripture as ""the commandment of God"" and ""the Word of God"".  If you wish to burn the word of God go ahead. I’ll sit that one out",Bulky_Ruin_6247,2025-05-04T06:17:54,-5
