Holding military parades for these important days is not really a problem.  Having a military parade for a leader's birthday is the problem.  China doesn't do that.

">anti-Trump Republican    AKA a Republican that's allowed to speak out because it won't impact the party in any meaningful way, or to just get elected.    The Republican party *IS* Trump at this point.  Anyone who is consistently vocal against Trump is either not going for reelection (especially AS a Republican) or were forced out of the party.  Many of the prominent anti-Trump politicians that got their way in during the last few elections (not just Presidential) very quickly dropped the mask and went all in on kissing Trump's ass, see for example Fetterman and Vance.  Vance is even more relevant given how his entire persona in his election was that of the anti-Trump Republican voice, before of course changing his tune after being elected, choking on Trump's mushroom shaped chode, becoming his VP, and being the stereotypical little pathetic minion bullies have that just constantly support everything they say and do.    There is no such thing as ""Anti-Trump Republicans anymore"".  That shit died out during his first term any one who believes they still exist buy into bullshit.",Randomman96,2025-05-02T11:33:25,3

"You said Trump had 2 out of 3, with an implication that was the case until recently. Now you seem to be saying that he had all 3 in 2015, when he started his first successful campaign almost 10 years ago.",RoboChrist,2025-05-02T10:09:31,1

"I'm not disagreeing with you, I'd just consider Jill Strein, Uncomitted or Walk Away Democrats to basically be MAGA at this point, and therefore worse. I haven't actually voted for a Republican since 2014. For ANYTHING.",Ridry,2025-05-02T11:37:01,2
"I didn‚Äôt say that. I said he always had two of the three, and when you seemed confused, I clarified that I was referring to the period before he entered politics. The third‚Äînational rebirth‚Äîonly emerged when he launched his first campaign. This is exactly why nuance matters. When people flatten timelines or ignore how things evolved, it gets easier to argue against reality than engage with it.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-05-02T10:28:34,5

"You've communicated poorly and you seem intent on putting the blame on me for not understanding your unstated assumptions as to when ""always"" begins for you.  Always can mean a lot of things.  He ""always"" had 2 out of 3 starting when? When he was born? Starting in 2008 when he was doing birther stuff? When he first ran for President in 2000? The only thing we've ruled out is 2015.  If he had 3/3 in 2015 when he became politically viable as a candidate, then why does the period of time when he had 2/3 matter? He was elected on 3/3, so it's not a change for this presidency in that case.  You used the word always in a context that does not state when your ""always"" begins. I don't think always is accurate the way you're using it.  For example, I don't think he had 2 out of 3 when he ran in 2000 for the reform party, do you?",RoboChrist,2025-05-02T10:35:21,-1

"""Always"" refers to his emergence as a public figure. Not childhood. Not some vague origin point. Grievance and dominance have been there from the beginning. Since you brought it up: you don‚Äôt see national rebirth in his 2000 Reform Party run. That was about ego and corruption, not collapse and restoration. The third element, palingenesis, didn‚Äôt show up until 2015 when he framed himself as the only one who could fix a broken America. That‚Äôs when it locked into place. We‚Äôre talking about the evolution into fascism, not word games. If it was confusing, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre confused‚Äînot because the intent wasn‚Äôt clear.  So yeah he had 2/3 until he didn't which is the point of my original post. Sorry you missed it.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-05-02T10:43:23,1
"Oh, so now something that cost $2 will now cost $30. How much of that $30 will go into Trump's pockets?",Sarrdonicus,2025-05-02T17:57:13,1
"He was a mostly non-political public figure in the 1980s. So that's not true to when he became a public figure.  I don't see grievance in the 2000 run, nor do I see dominance, outside of the drive to become president, which is therefore not exceptional.  I think your argument relies on a bunch of unstated assumptions that turned out to not be true, and you never considered that they might not be correct. So you're reacting like I'm wrong simply for having a wider context on Trump than you do.  Look up old interviews with Trump in 2000. He's a very different person from 2015 Trump or 2025 Trump.",RoboChrist,2025-05-02T10:54:51,0
"Now you‚Äôre just playing semantic games. Public figure doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúpolitician.‚Äù It means someone with a platform and reach, which Trump absolutely had by the late '80s. If you really think grievance and dominance weren‚Äôt central to how he operated back then, you clearly never watched *The Apprentice* or read his hit piece on the Central Park Five. He built his entire brand on public humiliation, control, and the idea that some people just deserve to lose.  I was happy to clarify when the national rebirth framing came into play, because watching the timeline of his trajectory tells us how bad things are going to get. Bury your head in the sand if you want. But analyzing that trajectory is how we fight back.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-05-02T11:04:52,2
