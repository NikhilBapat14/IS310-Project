"The petition for protection form filed in Maryland by Jennifer Vasquez Sura has boxes checked for ""acts of abuse,"" including kicking, slapping, shoving, mental injury of a child and detaining against will.     The form also describes an incident in November 2019 when he grabbed her ""by the hair in the car."" In December 2019, he allegedly grabbed her hair in the car and ""dragged"" her ""out of car leaving \[her\] in the street."" She wrote that he also ""broke"" her son’s tablet, ""broke doors"" in the house, pushed her against a wall, broke a phone and a television and damaged the walls that spring.  In the filing, written in Vasquez’s handwriting, she alleges Abrego Garcia repeatedly beat her, writing, ""At this point, I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he \[has\] left me.""    Four democrat reps went to El Salvador to bring this piece of trash back to the US. Without fail, democrats will align with scumbags. From Michael Brown to George Floyd to this gangbanging, wife beating, illegal alien.  Without fail.",cossbobo,2025-04-30T15:25:16,68
"Dude seems like a dirtbag.  We still need to comply with the courts and bring him back....  Then immediately deport him the correct way.  Then the President can congratulate the Democrats on their ""victory.""",cathbadh,2025-04-30T21:09:53,43
" A 2020 protective order case filed against deported ""Maryland man"" Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the suspected MS-13 gang member being held in El Salvador, sheds even more light on his violent past, a Fox News Digital review of the document found.  As I text, Van Hollen is back on a plane to bring him home (in his dreams of course)! And at your expense, because Van Hollen will not use his own money and only cares about publicity for himself.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T15:57:56,21
Can we start making bobble heads and t shirts of this guy and sell it to Democrats?,Crisgocentipede,2025-04-30T17:03:57,15

There's a special sort of irony of tying a sinking ship to yet another anchor....,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-30T15:38:50,1
Not to surprising after they made George Floyd their martyr.,Patsfan311,2025-04-30T14:54:56,199

"It really doesn't make a difference. Anyone with a brain can associate those tattoos with what the claim states, no one cares if Trump doesn't recognize letters and numbers added in. Even worse for leftist media is that to actually counter it they would be forced to show the picture itself as evidence which would only spread a photo they are trying to hide from their viewers.",Zerogates,2025-05-01T00:00:46,-34

"That's what I don't get, just fly the dipsh\*t to Miami, give him a 5 minute hearing in front of an immigration judge who will deem him deportable, then take him to the airport and fly him back out.  Case closed.  This story is sucking up way more oxygen than it should.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-30T15:17:45,80
"But the tattoos themselves are not evidence of anything. MS 13 literally engraves MS13 on their face, and Trump thinking visual aids in Calibri font are tattoos, and is basing his decisions on that is indeed embarrassing. We went from senile to stupid.",LemartesIX,2025-05-01T09:12:10,10
"That's essentially why I said. Bring him back, deport him the correct way.  That means due process",cathbadh,2025-05-01T09:26:55,10
A LOT of cases go before a judge via video. They don't have to even move him. He can stay right where he is and get his 'due process'.,hang3xc,2025-04-30T20:00:11,30
