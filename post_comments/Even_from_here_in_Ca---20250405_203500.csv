"Please, if everyone could take this opportunity to for the next week talk to people you know and ask them if they heard about the protests. Then immediately follow up that the next one’s happening April 19. Use the momentum from yesterday to raise awareness for the next one.",Friendly_Engineer_,2025-04-06T09:09:46,3
"Thought I'd point this out as like, EVERY time I've seen someone claim on reddit that ""nobody is talking about XYZ thing in the news"", I go and check, uh, the actual news and low and behold, they were, in fact, talking about it.      TLDR putting the possibility of disingenous human concern trolls and / or misinfo bots aside, PLEASE DO NOT make comments like this if you do not regularly actually check the ACTUAL news (which is not a magic thing that magically and inexplicably appears in Random Social Media App Of Your Choosing).",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-05T20:37:28,4
"But they’re not reporting the protests from red cities and the turnouts have been relatively huge. They are reporting a lot about Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Chicago but in my neck of the woods (Naples, FL) we’re deep red city and we had 2,000 show up. No one is talking about how many do red cities protested today. That’s annoying.",DissentFR,2025-04-05T21:11:37,2
"I agree! Too bad I seem to have dragged out the ""NOOOO EVERYTHING HAS TO BE BAD FOREVER"" crew by making this thread.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T17:29:36,3
"""But there's a story online"" isn't good enough.  What matters is the total coverage....and journalism in the USA uas only failed since Nixon was pardoned.  More importantly, both Trumpism and The War on Terror *we're only possible because of the greed of journalism.*     Anyone still blindly defending this joke of a profession is only demonstrating some of the public's guilt in all this chaos.",Apprehensive-Fun4181,2025-04-06T08:51:15,0
"There's FIFTEEN consistently relevant pages of unique articles from unique outlets at least (if not more) if you go to Google News and search literally just ""hands off protest"". Many of those ARE random US local publications once you get into the later pages, surely at least some of them are from the South. Like **who, specifically**, are you expecting to be doing this coverage of ""red states""? Nobody making these complaints about a perceived lack of coverage ever bothers to clarify (highly important) details like this.      I apologize if I sound abrasive but I just don't get why anyone (who isn't a literal bot or concern troll) thinks this idea of a **very**-obviously-non-existent conspiracy by the media to ""suppress"" anti-Trump news is useful. The proliferation of this dumb idea is actively harmful to your guys cause down there, the way I see it.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-05T21:41:39,1
"I legitimately don't know what it is you want if like, literally TONS of stories isn't enough. You're the one clearly trying to downplay this by saying ""a"" when obviously it's ""many"". I really don't understand this sentiment. Doomerism is always useless and harmful, way I see it.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T17:24:06,1
"It’s not that there is a conspiracy or anything, but the news media is now 100% for profit. So they only report on things that will give them the most eyeballs.   To put this is perspective, the Canadian government spends .12% of their budget or $1.44 billion to help get the news to the people, so not everything has to be centered around profit for its 40 million residents.   The United States spends .01% of their budget or 535 million to help educate its 340 million residents.   Or put another way 70% of CBC funding comes directly from the government. 10% of PBS funding comes directly from the government.   So virtually all the news we get has a profit motive, that means unless it’s about some crazy man eating people’s faces these smaller town stories (like these protests) never get national attention.   This problem is exacerbated because of the Sinclair group, which owns 40% of the local market channels. Sinclair is heavily right wing and often chooses not to report on items that don’t align with their politics. They own 294 television stations across the United States, covering 89 markets.   Watch this very short clip of how bad the problem is https://youtu.be/aGIYU2Xznb4?si=vAbZOwqOHj6mUmxm  Fast forward about 25 seconds in the video.   Now after all that tell me I don’t have a cause for concern.  EDIT: here’s the original video I was trying to find from deadspin: https://youtu.be/_fHfgU8oMSo?si=XoLWiEXhd1pBsvSh  Watch that instead. You don’t have to fast forward anything either.",DissentFR,2025-04-05T22:12:07,2
">if you go to Google News and search literally just ""hands off protest""     And this proves what?  Google search was broken intentionally for profits, but somehow I doubt you heard about that.    >search literally just    This is terrible grammar.   ""Hey, I found some, so the coverage must be perfect everywhere"". That's called *deniability*. ""But we republished a story somewhere on our site"" doesn't count.   *Journalism is not a real profession.* These are profit making operations first and last.  They have no valid systems of training or methodologies of inquiry.   No legitimate field would accept this system.",Apprehensive-Fun4181,2025-04-06T08:58:04,0
"I mean I guess you can be vaguely concerned about whatever based on these numbers but at the end of the day nothing matters beyond what actually occurs in reality, and so far that has not in fact been ""mass collusion between U.S. news outlets to actively suppress anti-Trump coverage"".",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-05T22:46:54,1
"I gave you a whole explanation that you didn’t seem to read. It’s not a conspiracy. It’s the result of having all of our news generated by for profit entities. They don’t set out with a goal to suppress anti-Trump coverage, but it happens because of the profit motive involved. In other countries (like Canada) this is resolved by having news sources that can exist without constantly worrying about the profit motive of every single story.",DissentFR,2025-04-05T23:38:45,2
LOL. Why would they need to do that?  The employees are compromised idiots at this point.     Anyone who still trusts journalism is just admitting they're not paying attention themselves. The failures are beyond obvious once one steps away from the eternal failed average.,Apprehensive-Fun4181,2025-04-06T09:00:43,1
"If I literally use a VPN to access the internet through an American address, it doesn't ""change"" anything in this regard. Everything I've said is still true in the U.S. as far as I can observe in any practical way. The problem is very clearly people who do not actually check the ACTUAL news just complaining that various things don't randomly appear magically on their phone, essentially.      Again NOTHING matters other than what is actually physically the case in reality, as far as I'm concerned, *potential* unrelated issues are not really relevant IMO.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T00:40:24,0
Show me ONE national publication that reported on the protests at Collier County.   I’ll wait.,DissentFR,2025-04-06T01:04:32,2
"I'm absolutely not going to do this thing where you, like I mentioned earlier, utterly fail to clearly state (or state in any coherent way whatsover) what the hell it is you ACTUALLY **specifically** want, and then demand I somehow guess what the hell it is you mean by this. I **don't know** what the fuck ""Collier County"" even is. Nor should I ""have"" to to make a thread like this.      You REALLY come off like you're just desperately grasping at straws as though you're fucking allergic to the idea of anything good **ever** happening anywher and desperately want to prove it's not, or something. I have absolutely nothing else to say that I didn't already.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T01:46:25,0

How more specific can I be?   I’m beginning to think you have trouble comprehending the English language. There’s no way anyone can be this dense.,DissentFR,2025-04-06T02:10:59,0

Nope. Not doing this. You're very very intentionally ignoring the actual point I'm very obviously trying to make.,ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T02:41:32,-1

"No, you're literally being as vague as you possibly can and jumping through hoops to skirt around my straightforward initial point, on purpose. I still don't know what the fuck ""Collier Country"" specifically is, **WHO IN PARTICULAR** you want to be covering it, and WHY you think whatever it is is important.      Again, to me, you REALLY come off like a contrarian doomer who is just dead-set on not allowing anyone to be positive about anything, at all costs.",ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T17:27:15,0
what the fuck are you even talking about? all your comments in this thread are bizarre nonsense.,ZootAllures9111,2025-04-06T17:27:55,1
