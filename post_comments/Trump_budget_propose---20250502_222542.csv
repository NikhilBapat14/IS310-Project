"1 trillion dollars. None of us could ever fathom. Just obscene. So how are we funding this if everyone is losing their jobs, can’t afford to live and the rich don’t pay taxes?",DadBreath12,2025-05-02T23:43:12,10
"So, basically anything that benefits struggling Americans.  Doesn't matter if you're a veteran, elderly, or a new mom with an unexpected baby because her right to choice was taken away.  See because the baby is here, they wash their hands of you?  You know there are reasons for the madness, right?  For defense spending, it's either for wars he's considering or plans for military ops on American soil.  Any MAGA in this thread willing to defend it?  I triple-dog dare you.  Gutting education?  To keep the masses ignorant.  Won't be long until they create work camps, a la russia.  This is what a tyrannical government looks like.",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-05-03T00:53:02,8

"Of all the shit to blame Trump for, military readiness isn't one. Yes, the SecDef is a drunk clown, but the SecDef doesn't run a war, and the best peacetime generals make the worst wartime ones, a fact that goes back millennia, because in peacetime, the primary task of military command is to enforce rules, and in wartime, the primary task is to break them.
