"It's amazing he can say all of these things:  * ""That's good,"" Trump responded. ""They deserve it."" - referring to the high tariffs equating to an embargo * ""You don't know that. You don't know whether or not China's going to eat it,"" - referring to ""it'll raise prices on everything"" * ""China probably will eat those tariffs."" - referring to whether prices will rise * ""At 145 they basically can't do much business with the United States,""  Not only are these statements inconsistent (a Trump hallmark) he still appears unable to put any two of his own statements together and see what their impact will be.  Are they doing business with us or not? Exclusively both according to Trump, they're simultaneously embargoed and will eat the cost.

"It’s likely the other way around. China sells a lot of manufactured goods to the US. Because it exports more than what it imports from the US, the PRC has a surplus of US dollars. Now, the PRC sorta pegs its currency to the USD and tries to keep an exchange rate of around 7 renminbi to 1 USD. For context, you can purchase one person’s meal in the single digits RMB, and it is a reason why many Chinese people don’t cook their own breakfast. The Chinese government achieves this exchange rate by purchasing 1 USD from their country’s businesses and giving them 7 or so RMB each. Finally, the PRC sees that there’s a ton of USD sitting there in the Chinese unitary reserve bank, so they might as well make a bit more cash by purchasing US treasury bonds using the excess dollars.",emerald6_Shiitake,2025-04-29T22:18:42,5
"No disagreement here. The alignment between tech, militarized religion, international authoritarianism, and home grown xenophobia and cruelty has been focusing its powers since at least 9/11 and simply accelerated in the past decade. We didn't build a counter narrative fast enough and with sufficient momentum to confront it.   It's our moment to champion our virtues as the truly pluralistic society as we told ourselves we could be, and while hope is waning with each news drop about another capitulation from areas that should stand, it seems pretty bleak. There is always the raw might of an aligned populace that rediscovers its common cause.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-29T20:13:59,4
"I think that's one of the big flaws in their plan. I don't think the tech (wannabe) overlords really have much use for the rank and file Trump supporter beyond their ability to deliver the population into the trap we're in. I'd imagine they think less of them than they believe Hilary Clinton did. The regime is going to have to rely entirely on the religious wing of the coalition to maintain their cognitive dissonance, which is going to become increasingly difficult as Trump, like in the example you provided, causes material harm to their friends and neighbors.   If the coalition begins to see Trump as a liability rather than their vacuous tool, they are going to have to either replace him (and lose his base, who worships him and nobody else within the cabal) or watch him fuck them over, too. I believe they will eventually militarize the police (which they already have promised) and deputize the military (thinly veiling the suspension of posse comitatus), they have their burgeoning panopticon in Theil's Palantir and the data DOGE was sent to retrieve and populate its AI apparatus.   But Trump could fuck that up himself. Or they could have a falling out because he's insane and self serving. If that happens, the people he serve will be naked and without their bull and possess nothing but weaponry and propaganda that I don't believe will work without Trump. And then, you have America without the Antichrist to hypnotize it now starting squarely at his basic bitch minions everybody already hates.

"That was a fantastic video, thanks!   I just don't see the long term viability of an Authoritarian state in the U.S. I think this is the final gasp of the global boomer population and will reshape itself (unpredictability) as soon as the authoritarians across the globe (all roughly the same age) die. To my knowledge, no modern dictatorship has succeeded without the cult of personality that infected the host country.   I believe the secret is to build an alternative (society, structure, etc.) prior to the downfall of the regime that is viable enough that it was already threatening to render the current system obsolete by the time the big moment comes. That makes replacement of the dictator by the new war lord impossible, and the U.S. has enough people with imagination and intelligence to do that.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-29T23:52:58,1
"I'm not sure how that works. The states aren't so autonomous that they can negotiate like sovereign countries. In the past, presidents pressured states via legislation to achieve compliance (e.g. Reagan tying federal highway funding to raising the drinking age from 18 to 21). Nobody has ever tried to ""rule"" America by Executive Order alone.   Congress is supposed to handle those things, and since the Republicans are complicit, they're allowing it to happen. Additionally, Trump is drumming up fake crises to enact wartime powers so he can, again, ""rule"" by decree. A state making counter demands might signal a different kind of crisis, and if that were to happen, I don't know that it would be New Mexico doing it.

"I saw that. I've been thinking that it might be wise to study how the interviewer handled Trump's amorphous, non sequitur, bullying style. His base tends to speak the way he does now because it's difficult to have a human conversation with a person intent on simply ""winning"" every interaction. Specifically, that interviewer kept his responses tight, short, uncompromising, and simply pushed past to the next subject by concluding with the word ""contested"" before moving on.   Everything after that makes Trump (and I speculate, people who now speak like him) sound desperate. It turns the tables. But you have to be willing to leave it at that instead of trying to win or achieve consensus or understanding. Basically, it's the intellectual version of drawing a line or starting disagreement and allowing the other person to stay in their bubble. That fascist style of discourse relies on the frustration of thinking people to exhaust themselves and become emotional and frustrated. That interviewer did something different. No confrontation, really. Just, ""contested"" and move on.   Would likely work everywhere someone is talking like Trump",BarbaGramm,2025-04-30T07:28:46,2
