I tried. You went to ad hominems immediately.  Like...No that's exactly what you posted lol then you got snippy when all I did was say socially conservative because fucking duh (except for immigration) and economically progressive and socialist.   Also taking people's happiness or optimism as slobbering is probably something worthy of talking to a therapist about. That's a really negative way to view the world,elbenji,2025-05-08T16:52:55,6

"All I did was say not really, especially with Trump's hard on for torturing migrants and him calling him out on Twitter. Your initial comment if anything was rather reasonable beyond that first part  You went all in like OH DO YOU KNOW ALL HIS POLICIES like almost immediately. Which was very 0-100  Also yes, the slobbering comment is an ad hominems",elbenji,2025-05-08T16:56:32,2
"> Also yes, the slobbering comment is an ad hominems  No, that's not what an ad hominem is.   At worst, the slobbering comment is an exaggeration, which is a rhetorical device used for emphasis.   An ad hominem would be attacking the people instead of the argument, which is not something I've done here at all. In fact that's much closer to what you've been doing.",tsaihi,2025-05-08T17:08:32,2
"> All I did was say not really  You confidently announced that I was wrong with absolutely no evidence and I pointed that out. A little sarcastically maybe but you acting like I've got veins popping out of my neck because I'm calmly pointing out that you're wrong is very silly.  Especially since all of your other responses have basically been founded on straight up lies about what I'm saying.   Maybe you should consider how much you're projecting onto strangers on the internet, especially when that stranger is saying objectively true things about the Catholic Church (an institution that confidently asserts you're going to hell, by the way, and tirelessly works to pile onto that by instituting earthly punishments for people like you all around the world).   I think an institution that says and does that is bad! But keep being mad at me for pointing that out, I guess? Unlike the Catholic church, I have no issue with women speaking their minds.",tsaihi,2025-05-08T17:04:18,1
I think you're also arguing against some strange strawman here too? Oh well,elbenji,2025-05-08T17:13:15,2
