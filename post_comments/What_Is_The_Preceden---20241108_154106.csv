"Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms.  In terms of should/shouldn't/can/can't do, it's a second term like any other. There are political ramifications stemming from the potential time in office - knowing the President will be gone in four years creates a different calculus than knowing they may last eight years - but otherwise the office and its powers are the same regardless of whether it's a first or second term.",ViskerRatio,2024-11-08T16:52:35,11
"There is only one historical precedent here. Grover Cleveland was the only man to lose re-election and then get elected again 4 years later. Seeing as how this was the mid 1800s, I would be hesitant to try and clean anything from that example. The nature of the presidency and our party system has changed quite a bit since then.  But I also don't see why we should limit ourselves to presidential candidates. Lots of other offices have this sort of thing happen somewhat frequently, and it doesn't really teach us anything useful. The power of a political office, especially in the US, is directly connected to the rest of the political system. Whether Trump is able to get the House, and with what size margin, has a direct impact on what he'll be able to accomplish.",mormagils,2024-11-08T16:57:12,2
"Besides the Grover Cleveland example, it's very common in other countries. Many countries have a cap on the number of continuous terms but not total terms.",loselyconscious,2024-11-08T19:45:47,2
"There's a line of thinking that a president is more free to take unpopular actions in a second term because there's no consideration of  winning votes for reelection. But I think that's faded somewhat in recent times because of higher levels of partisan feeling nowdays, that unpopular moves would impact the party's future success.   Gap or no, it's still Trump's last term. Depending on how active a role JD plays, and whether he seems a viable presidential candidate in 2028, there might be some window dressing in late 2027/early 2028.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-08T21:34:13,2
"Another thing to consider: if the Republicans do hold the House (by a narrow margin), the Senate and the White House, they should know it will only be for two years. Modern historical precedent is that a party with a trifecta loses seats in the house and senate during the next midterm elections (2026). So any big policy changes must be accomplished in the first two years or not at all. Thatâ€™s why Obamacare had to be rushed through in a lame duck session, and didnâ€™t fully fulfill Obamaâ€™s policy goals. And with the Republicans having a small majority in the House, it might be that Democrats not only gain control of the House in 2026, but will hold the House by a larger margin than the Republicans have in 2024 (and I donâ€™t think control of the House has been called yet, but the likeliest outcome seems to be that the Republicans will control by a few seats).",Hazel1928,2024-11-09T08:18:42,2
"Iâ€™m also interested in the politics within the Republican Party. As a never Trump republican, I wonder if a slip up or general unpopularity could throw the next Republican nomination to Haley or someone else more from the Reagan wing of the party and less from the populist/isolationist wing. If the GOP suffers a bloodbath in the 2026 midterms, a Reagan Republican could start their campaign by pointing to the bloodbath under Trump.",Hazel1928,2024-11-09T08:23:30,1
"Grover Cleveland.   No, he is definitely not allowed any more time after this four years. Period.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-11-09T11:13:20,1
"The only other time it happened successfully is Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s. Some others have tried but lost, but even that is really rare in general. For the most part if you lose a presidential election you arenâ€™t gonna get nominated again",nyyforever2018,2024-11-11T13:44:38,1
So like a revolving door basically? That's interestingÂ ,djhazmatt503,2024-11-08T21:46:55,2
Trump doesnâ€™t care about anyone but himself. He screws everyone who supports him over. Ask Michael cohen.,96suluman,2024-11-08T23:24:40,1
I think we're seeing the revitalization of the party system similar to the early 20th century. Both parties are veering too far in either direction. Democrat progressivism focuses on breaking barriers for the sake of breaking barriers. Republican conservatism is focus on returning to perceived normalcy of the late 20th Century. Both are flawed and what happens over the next four years (how Republican govern and how Democrats recover) will determine the face of the electoral system going forward.,[deleted],2024-11-15T15:12:51,1
"That may have been true but with the way heâ€™s been embracing And promoting Vance, Musk, Gabbard, and Ramaswamy I think heâ€™s very concerned about his legacy and not letting the Republican Party once again become the party of never trumpers who hate his guts.   Iâ€™m convinced he wants this movement to continue and never let the party go back to the days of cheneys, McCain, McConnell, Romney, Paul Ryan, Mike pence etc",vsv2021,2024-11-10T18:19:21,3
"A podcast I listen to is already predicting that the Democrats will win in 2028 due to worldwide discontent with the status quo. We had 4 administrations in a row that got 2 terms (one got 3 terms). Reagan & HW Bush, Clinton, W Bush, Obama. Maybe we are going to start flipping every 4 years instead of every 8 years.",Hazel1928,2024-11-15T18:51:39,1
"I don't think it's about Trump for the Republicans. I think they will endure Trump for 2 years, then invoke the 25th amendment to remove Trump and allow Vance to ascend to the office while remaining eligible for two more runs (service 10 years total). If Vance becomes President before the two year mark, he could only run for reelection once. I think, at least for everyone other than trump, this is about Party longevity through Vance using Trump as a springboard.",[deleted],2024-11-15T15:08:02,1
"I can see that. I think FDR showed the US that single party control of the executive branch is distasteful, even if it does have benefits. I think we may start seeing less two term presidents in the future except in times of crisis.",[deleted],2024-11-25T22:10:42,1
The Republican Party hates Vance just as much as Trump. Do you not remember how badly McConnell tried to beat back his primary. The establishment was disgusted when he was selected as the VP over Rubio and burgum.,vsv2021,2024-11-15T19:01:29,1
"I had read predictions of Republicans never winning again as we become a majority minority nation. However, we see that isnâ€™t true.   I believe one reason is that hispanics assimilate in a generation or two and become white people like the Irish and Italians before them. Another reason is that the Democratic Party  thinks they are for the little guy, but college educated white people decide what the little guy needs and they are out of tune with actual little guys. And I read a prediction that after the 2030 census, red states will gain 12 congressional seats and blue states will lose 12 for a net swing of 24. After 2030, I wonder if the Democrats can win a national election.",Hazel1928,2024-11-26T18:01:49,1
"Thatâ€™s true. However, I think the parties care more about longevity of power than anything else. Remember, most establishment Republicans hated Trump before 2016 and up until 2022/23. While Vance might be a hard pill to swallow for them, party control is worth it. Just my thought, though. Only the next few years will tell.",[deleted],2024-11-25T22:09:14,1
"Thatâ€™s an interesting take. As a liberal-leaning voter myself, I do see the Democrats having a hard time recovery from this year without major restructuring. However, I equally see the Republican Party having stability issues after Trump is resigned from politics. Much like the Tea Party, the MAGA movement could easily diminish into a minority branch of the party while the wider establishment seeks to grow their base with those college educated voters, women, and minority groups. Overall, the next 10-15 years will be interesting to watch, especially with the context of seeing history unfold.   I appreciate the intelligent conversation from opposing sides. ðŸ˜Š",[deleted],2024-11-28T00:37:06,1
