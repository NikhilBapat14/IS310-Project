As planned by Trump for himself & other wealthy tax cheats... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-07T16:51:06,10
Remaining auditors had better go after the big fish tax cheats because that's where the big money is. Give the little guys a break until you're fully staffed again.,YoungestDonkey,2025-05-07T16:53:33,11

"In some dark way, and in a way that they will probably ignore, it’s funny how the people who complained how the government was corrupt for years are now getting to learn what actual corrupt governance looks like.   They never cared though because to them corrupt meant ‘doing something I don’t like’. ",eskimospy212,2025-05-07T17:55:22,8

It turns out that  IRS auditors are a net positive on cashflow for the feds.    My take: audit every return that show a million in income or assets.   Expand the auditors to suit.,vacuous_comment,2025-05-07T22:44:07,2

If there is one sure bet in live it is that any republican president will cut irs workers while giving out huge tax cuts.,if_only_i_r_smart,2025-05-07T19:41:45,1

Just in time for tax audit season. Where will the money come from with bonds and the USD in retreat and an economic recession most likely underway? Add to this the proposed corporate tax cuts and it appears that they think it grows on trees.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-08T00:49:14,4

You knew this nation was doomed when right wing media convinced those in the lower tax brackets that funding the irs meant that the agents would be coming after them. Because the agency that is responsible for generating revenue would surely rather go after some blue collar employee who goofed and forgot about a few hundred bucks rather than some multilmillionaire withholding hundreds of thousands of dollars.,Renegade-Ginger,2025-05-07T23:44:59,1
