" Lead Lines:  President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum Thursday aimed at investigating ActBlue, the leading Democratic fundraising platform.  The memorandum directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to “investigate allegations regarding the unlawful use of online fundraising platforms to make 'straw' or 'dummy' contributions or foreign contributions to political candidates and committees, and to take appropriate action to enforce the law.""  It specifically names ActBlue as an online fundraising platform being used ""to improperly influence American elections.""   Excerpts: Letter from Arizona US Senator Mark Kelly:   Donald Trump is trying to cut our legs out from underneath us. Politico reported today that he plans on signing a memorandum targeting ActBlue, the platform many grassroots donors use to contribute to the causes and campaigns they support.  I ran for Arizona’s U.S. Senate seat in 2020 and 2022. Well over 1 million individual people chipped in $5 here and $10 there to get us over the finish line.  Grassroots donors are the primary way we funded those campaigns — and we didn’t take a dime of corporate PAC money. Grassroots donors are also how we’re funding our fight against the Trump Administration right now. And it’s normal folks like you, chipping in whatever they can, who will defeat MAGA Republicans next November and help us check Trump’s power.  Trump wants to shut all of that down. He wants to use his executive power to stamp out any opposition to his extremism. We can’t let him.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-25T07:28:04,328
