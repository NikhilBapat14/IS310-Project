"You should ask this in /r/NeutralPolitics if you want sourced answers.  Anyway your colleagues are wrong…  Russia has broken various “diplomatic promises”. E.g the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, which guarantee the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states, the inviolability of borders, distancing from the threat or use of force, and the freedom of states to choose or change their security arrangements. Joining Nato is to choose a security arrangement.",MrOaiki,2023-01-11T01:53:53,50
If I remember correctly they gave security guarantees to Ukraine when the latter gave up their nuclear arsenal that it inherited from the USSR. With the annexation of Crimea and last year's invasion I would consider that promise well and truly broken.,Rohar_Kradow,2023-01-11T02:11:52,66
"Russian forces in Moldova, Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine have routinely broken cease-fires. Russia's aggression in Ukraine 2014-22 is in violation of the Budapest Memorandum. Russia has not met its CSTO treaty obligations to Armenia, who were attacked by Azerbaijan.  In the Brezhnev era, the Soviets routinely violated the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Accords.  This is just off the top of my head, so it's scratching the surface.",[deleted],2023-01-11T10:08:17,22
"Russia is a signatory member of the Geneva conventions, and seems to be actively breaking as many of them as it possibly can in Ukraine right now, so I'm going to say no.  https://www.icrc.org/en/document/geneva-conventions-1949-additional-protocols",houinator,2023-01-11T04:31:27,27
"Depends on who you ask.  Ukraine says Russia promised territorial integrity when Ukraine gave up its nukes.  Russia says Ukraine violated that agreement first by seeking NATO membership.  Your mistake (based on your friend's erroneous black-and-white claim) is assuming that a clear case can be made that a diplomatic promise is broken.  First, no one really thinks a ""diplomatic promise"" is truly binding -- it's assumed that nations will break their promises when they decide it is in their interest to do so.  They are assumed to be kind of like white lies in the first place.  Second, when it comes to ""diplomatic promises,"" there is rarely a clear, black and white case of ""breaking"" the promise.  Hitler invading Russia in 1941 is a pretty clear case, but those are few and far in between, at least in modern times.  Almost always the alleged promise breaker will claim the other side broke it first.  And sometimes even set up a false flag operation to support the claim.  So your friend's claim is oversimplistic.  Don't fall prey to his error.",phreeeman,2023-01-11T13:22:12,3
"Very topical considering recent events. The Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine gives up their inherited nukes to Russia, in exchange, the USA, Britain and Russia give it guarantees that it will be protected in case of attack.   Everyone walked away from that thinking it was a win too. USA and Britain get to keep nukes off the black market, Ukraine is freed of the extremely expensive burden of nuclear weapons, and Russia gets their nukes back, and is treated as an equal power with the USA and Britain even in a post Soviet world.   But I suppose it wasn't good enough for one of the parties.",notpoleonbonaparte,2023-01-11T14:27:14,4
"The short answer is yes, but probably not as many as the US",DCcalling,2023-01-11T09:53:18,-6
"The Budapest Memorandum is what you’re thinking of. Russia insists they haven’t broken it, but then they *would* say that.",cpast,2023-01-11T08:05:32,18

"Yeah I don’t get how applying to join NATO and the EU meant they violated that agreement. They didn’t invade Russia, NATO def hasn’t.   Hopefully russia is a failed state before putin dies. I’d love to see the federation collapse before he does.  Like if he had a heart attack over it right afterwards I’d be just crestfallen! /s",Graywulff,2023-01-12T15:18:33,2
"The Budapest Memo more says neither Russia or the West can unduly influence Ukraine. It's a very short memo.  https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22_ukraine-the_budapest_memo.pdf?m=1645824948  So Ukraine is move wherever they want, as long as they aren't unduly influenced to do so.",ProLifePanda,2023-01-11T14:26:16,7
You could call the whole orange revolution thing unduly influencing. That's the thing with treaties they're phrased on such ways they don't really mean much. It becomes philosophical.,hariseldon2,2023-01-11T15:46:37,-4
"Surely two individuals giving speeches on a square can't break up international treaties made by nations. Even if it does count as some sort of violation, which in my mind is unlikely, it in no way compares to the constant efforts of Russian intelligence services and armed forces to explicity end Ukrainian sovereignty.",Rohar_Kradow,2023-01-12T01:34:45,5
"Oh yes, the old ""treaties are inherently meaningless"" axiom.   The hydra of nihilism and reality denial rears its ugly head.",zossima,2023-01-11T22:36:17,2
"It could be summed up by ""might makes right"". Just think of all the treaties the US or any of the other major empires like the British empire broke in its history.",hariseldon2,2023-01-11T22:48:12,0
"Umm, you tip your hand talking about Russia like it's actually a ""major empire"", much less an empire now at all. LOL Previat, comrade.
