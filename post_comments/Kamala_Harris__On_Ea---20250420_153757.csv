Would this have been that bad? Really? Going to bed and waking up without your stomach in knots? With a VP with a personality and a sense of empathy? WTF people. Let’s fix this.,poodlepit,2025-04-20T17:52:38,12

This makes me almost physically sick from what should have been.  This is the country that I thought I have lived a life in.  I can’t believe we are living in this other reality. It is so fucking tragic. All the pain and loss.,ramapo66,2025-04-20T18:37:54,9

"We were robbed of a future leader of the free world. I mourn what could have been. I have to put up with two idiots at my workplace, one of them is a dumb maga bitch who thinks she’s going to get the house she’s always wanted. The other appears to be high as fuck and chose Not to vote for anyone just because he is an “atheist“ and says that’s why he “doesn’t believe in voting“. I spin like a turbine in my bed wondering how I could possibly shatter their delusions so that I can reach them. I have lived through two democratic administrations plus those four years in between when the dumpty was kept under a good amount of control. I know what a free society looks like because I have spent quite some time in it, and I wonder what and how much it will take to fight ourselves back into it.",WJGThatsit,2025-04-23T01:44:03,1
