Also funny because in I think it was January he made a truth social post taking about how “its a trump economy now!” But now that things are obviously bad because of trumps actions it’s suddenly a Biden economy again.,Demonking3343,2025-05-02T01:48:29,15
What a fucking pussy. He probably blames Biden for the bacon strips in his underwear.,DisastrousCicada3802,2025-05-02T01:45:19,10

"This guy has never understood the idea of accountability in his entire life. He honestly believes none of his actions have been wrong.   Will say this, children will be brought up and trump will be an example of how not to behave.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-02T03:02:12,1
