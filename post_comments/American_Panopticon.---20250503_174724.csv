Trump has already said he likes how Xi keeps his people in line... we know what's coming next. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-03T17:53:51,151
">In March, President Trump issued an executive order aiming to eliminate the data silos that keep everything separate. Historically, much of the data collected by the government had been heavily compartmentalized and secured; even for those legally authorized to see sensitive data, requesting access for use by another government agency is typically a painful process that requires justifying what you need, why you need it, and proving that it is used for those purposes only. Not so under Trump.  >This is a perilous moment. Rapid technological advances over the past two decades have made data shedding ubiquitous—whether it comes from the devices everyone carries or the platforms we use to communicate with the world. As a society, we produce unfathomable quantities of information, and that information is easier to collect than ever before.  >Advancements in artificial intelligence promise to turn this unwieldy mass of data and metadata into something easily searchable, politically weaponizable, and maybe even profitable. DOGE is reportedly attempting to build a “master database” of immigrant data to aid in deportations; NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya has floated the possibility of an autism registry (though the administration quickly walked it back). America already has all the technology it needs to build a draconian surveillance society—the conditions for such a dystopia have been falling into place slowly over time, waiting for the right authoritarian to come along and use it to crack down on American privacy and freedom.  >But what can an American authoritarian, or his private-sector accomplices, do with all the government’s data, both alone and combined with data from the private sector? To answer this question, we spoke with former government officials who have spent time in these systems and who know what information these agencies collect and how it is stored.",mixplate,2025-05-03T17:49:06,72

"Think about all the money they spent and efforts they went through to get data for Trump’s fundraising machine and for his social manipulation efforts on Facebook and other social media.   This is about stealing this data. This dataset will “leave the building,” and they will continue to use it in the future.   Furthermore, they’ll be happy to pretend to burn all copies of this data when they’re on the way out the door so that when laws are made more specific and protective in the future, the Dems will not have the data. No way they’re giving Dems power over this data.",tackle_bones,2025-05-03T21:08:28,20

Whether they're ahead of us or behind us, I don't know, but we are far advanced in entertainment media, which may be far more controlling than surveillance.  In any case, both the end of privacy and a surfeit of entertainment spell the end to democratic and social forms.",fxkatt,2025-05-03T18:19:50,21
The only way Americans can combat this regime is to get organized! It’s the one thing the powers that be fear most. Protests are inconsequential to them. But collective actions of actual substance and mutual aid actually get them shaking in their boots. That’s why they shut that shit down as quickly as possible.  But if we never come together and remain in this purely individualistic culture they can easily pick us off one by one. But they cannot stop the power of a people united.,consumeshroomz,2025-05-03T20:56:38,12

"Here is a summary of this article created by my Apple AI tool.  I hope this is ok to post.  The article is paywalled and long, and I wanted to make sure people were able to access the info as easily and quickly as possible.  The Trump administration is pooling data from various federal agencies, raising concerns about potential misuse. This data, including sensitive information from agencies like the IRS, DHS, and FBI, could be weaponized for political purposes, targeting individuals or groups based on attributes like mental health or income. Experts warn of the dangers of this data collection, which could lead to authoritarian control and abuse of power.  The Trump administration, through DOGE, is combining data across federal agencies, disregarding privacy measures and laws like the Privacy Act of 1974. This data collection, which could be used for AI training or other purposes, raises concerns about potential abuse and the erosion of privacy protections. Critics argue this shift towards data exploitation mirrors Trump’s transactional ethos, prioritizing self-interest over public service.  The Trump administration is combining previously siloed government data with private data sets, potentially compromising sensitive information like medical records and financial data. This raises concerns about potential misuse, including blackmail, intimidation, and targeting of political enemies. The erosion of data privacy could lead to a chilling effect on dissent and a loss of trust in government institutions.",Psychological-Art752,2025-05-04T16:03:54,2
