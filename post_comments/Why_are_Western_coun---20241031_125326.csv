Russian propaganda is a big part of it also. If you look at countries in EU you see Russia using immigration as a weapon.Â    https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/22/finland-to-close-all-but-one-russia-crossing-point-to-stop-asylum-seekers,mawkishdave,2024-10-31T15:09:19,17
"I mean, it should be self-evident. Things are getting harder everywhere. Climate change, systemic neglect, demographic decline, a world reeling from 20 years of continuous warfare, the global economy collectively reaching the limits to growth--late stage capitalist malaise. All of it is causing things to get harder.  In countries where things were already hard to begin with, if they get even harder, people are going to feel the squeeze and that squeeze is going to push them right over the border. People go scrambling for the exits when there is danger. It's human nature. The wealthy industrialized nations are magnets to people looking for a safe exit.  I mean, it's not the first time this has happened. But right now I think it's happening on a global scale.  Ultimately, these crises manifest differently from place to place. But the end result is always the same. Rising nativist sentiment. Rising autocratic politics. Rising militant and police violence.  Most people really haven't caught on yet but humanity is like the frog sitting in a pot full of water that's slowly getting hotter and hotter. Almost imperceptibly. As a species, we won't really figure it out until we're already collectively boiling to death.",mr-louzhu,2024-11-01T11:52:26,3

"I tend to think this is an illusion.  Every twenty, thirty years there is a big wave of immigrants and a subsection of locals always freak out about them for reasons that always prove to be someplace between overblown and completely fabricated.",ScalesOfAnubis19,2024-10-31T14:40:48,20
"Because they caused it. Decades of colonizing and destabilizing the Global South have lead to shitty economics and ethnic cleansing, which lead to refugees.   And then put into action harsh immigration polices, that's exactly how you create a ""problem.""",Different_Ad_2613,2024-11-03T08:52:10,2
"It's always been a focal point, but it gets brought up more during election season.  As for struggling, we (USA) can't handle all the people coming in; we can't financially support them at all, last year it cost 150 billion. States are cutting funding just to support illegal immigrants. Not to mention no vetting processing lets criminals in.  My understanding with Europe it's a clash of cultures, you have western ideals that don't work with Islamic beliefs and systems.",ALoneSpartin,2024-11-01T03:21:22,4
"In the east countries are more willing to just refuse immigrants, and even refuse refugees.  Less developed nations are also generally quite willing to aggressively refuse people.  Another factor which causes some variation is that a fair amount of immigration is a result of people fleeing poor situations in their home country, so unrest, war, or natural disasters can cause a sudden outflow of people.    There's also the fact that you just don't hear about some stuff as much; I'm pretty sure there's some issues with the rohingya not being so welcome as refugees, but it just doesn't filter into the news so much.",zlefin_actual,2024-10-31T15:03:54,4
"While there's an influx, it's not even vaguely as enormous as Western media makes it out to be. The influx however is overall prompted by numerous civil wars and otherwise unrest in various parts of the non-Western world. Their communities and even governments are waging war on the populace, so people flee to safety. Civil unrest also results in what's called a ""brain drain,"" where people who are educated, or otherwise skilled and looking to progress fields of study, have to leave their homes because there are no relevant jobs or opportunities in their local communities. If you're a skilled surgeon who isn't provided proper equipment and whose expertise is strangled by conservative local policies, or a new college graduate who just got a degree in electrical engineering in a small town with one power plant that's not currently hiring, or you are a biology teacher who is being branded ""an enemy of \[insert religion\]"" just because you teach about evolution... so on so forth, people need to leave for opportunities and safety.",ray25lee,2024-11-01T04:10:38,3
"It depends. In general, a lot of these issues are because many Western Countries are more developed. If I were struggling for money and wanted to immigrate, I would aim for a richer country over a poorer one.   Many Eastern countries that are developed are also a bit isolated. Japan and Taiwan are islands  South Korea is on a peninsula tip where it's only land neighbor is a country that doesn't really let people just pass through (though they deal a lot with North Korean refugees) and Singapore has a similar issue.   These ones are a bit harder to immigrate to if you have no money. Also, in general, Western countries are a bit less xenophobic than Eastern ones so arguably more open to helping others.   However, there isn't really an immigration crisis going on. It is blown out of proportion because it is a useful tool for some political groups. Fear of the outsider is probably one of the oldest tactics that humans have used.",JayNotAtAll,2024-10-31T20:44:38,3
It's intentional by all countries to control wage inflation. They are all scared of wage inflation and have betrayed their population.,AssociationCivil8643,2024-11-02T10:25:04,1
"Lol... Do the people that post here have a special force field that makes gas, food and housing prices any cheaper?  Normal folks are struggling to get by and their taxes ( which they feel are too high ) are getting sent to the Ukraine and to give housing, food and money to people that came here illegally. I could copy and paste the migrant crimes from 2023 and 2024 but it would take up too many pages.... just 2 days ago a 5 year old girl was brutalized in new York  We have American citizens and veterans with mental problems and drug problems sleeping on the streets and using them as an outdoor toilet and heroin den.  I have never seen more people in one place do more mental gymnastics to skirt around the real issue. Not only will they not like the message they wont like my delivery. I will get downvoted into oblivion for stating the obvious.",danbrooks3k,2024-11-04T01:34:26,1
"Because theyâ€™re not enforcing laws the b way they used to. Every country is letting lots of illegal immigrants in are having problems. Many are similar. eg, Poland, who didnâ€™t change those policies is not having anywhere near the kinds of problems. The rest of the countries are. ,",SheSellsSeaGlass,2024-11-06T22:11:07,1
"Because you can have a generous safety net or you can have loose immigration policy, but having both is an eternal recipe for disaster.   One little told story about the wave of immigration from Europe to the U.S. in the 19th and early 20th centuries is [how many went back](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2017/09/returning-home-age-mass-migration), in many cases because that was their plan all along. Presumably we benefited from their hustle while they were here. We certainly werenâ€™t handing out government benefits by the sackful in 1875.",knockatize,2024-11-01T06:05:49,1
Itâ€™s simply an issue that is being disproportionately represented by certain crowds that unites their hurting constituents against a common enemy.  Not saying itâ€™s fascismâ€¦but it certainly comes from a certain fascist playbook.,fellatio-del-toro,2024-11-01T12:36:20,0
