"Jokes aside, what automobile manufacturer, let alone CEO has a negative opinion from half the country? Not indifference, not preference, but actual, active disapproval from the potential customer base.   Hell, a ton of people know Chrysler/Jeep makes shit vehicles... But hardly anyone bats an eye if a mother with a midlife crisis is driving a wrangler down the highway.   You could have a Chevy, Ram or Ford truck down the highway, and might think how the truck isn't from your ""team"" but it's still a truck and you know it can get a job done.   No company is going to run a fleet of cyber trucks. EV market continues to grow, despite Tesla's market loss. Do you want safety? Tesla doesn't use radar/lidar. Do you want something that drives well? Tesla's are built like a cardboard box on wheels. Do you want something that helps minimize ecological impact? Tesla's largest share holder and representative is in bed with a criminal who's stance is antithetical to preservation. Are you a good ol' American conservative? You've been listening to anti-electric vehicle propaganda for the last 10+ years... You won't be buying a Tesla anyway because you're committed to that brand of cancel culture. Do you want the best technology? The Chinese have them beat.   Tesla is dead, less it can live an idle life long enough to become the next Volkswagen... Except Tesla doesn't have the commercial and military value to keep it's giant factories running post-consumer saturation.   Now he's talking about bringing in a failing company 'Xitter' and a startup xAI into Tesla.
