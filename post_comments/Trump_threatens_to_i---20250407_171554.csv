The chances Xi is going to cower to trump and dropping the 34% is like zero.   Xi is correct in thinking trump is an idiot.   Xi is flatout finding new markets. I see a lot of African countries have said they will take as much Chinese goods as they can ship.  The world is on Xi's side not inept trump.,netsheriff,2025-04-07T17:35:32,1
50% sure sure - that should do it. Why not? Next he’s going to stomp on the ground and say “infinity % plus 1!”,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-07T17:22:19,1

"Absolutely wild how the same people who claim to fight for ""the little guy"" are pushing policies that end up squeezing working-class families while the ultra-rich keep cashing in. Tariffs like these punish *us*.   If we really cared about American workers, we’d be investing in fair wages, education, affordable healthcare, not playing billionaire chess games with global economies. Let’s stop pretending this is about patriotism.  We need policies that lift everyone up, not just the ones already at the top.",DrSitara_CKT,2025-04-07T17:45:00,1

"Trump has already backed out of trade agreements he brokered. Why would anyone believe he will hold this next negotiation? Trump is desperate for legacy, Canada 51st state, Greenland, Mar A Lago Accord. He doesn’t care about what it costs he wants something people will remember when he is dead, the problem is he doesn’t know how to get there on any of it",Leraldoe,2025-04-07T17:59:38,1
