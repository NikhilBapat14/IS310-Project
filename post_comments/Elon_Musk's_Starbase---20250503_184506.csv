"We'll see how this goes, often the problem with these privatized developments is that they end up with an issue for things like sanitation or sewage: mostly companies just push the costs onto the municipality, but when the company is footing the bill themselves now they cut corners, such as only pumping the sewage away just far enough not to offend the wealthy inhabitants of the settlement instead of paying for a treatment plant  Maybe they can make illegal pipes that pump the sewage into a nearby counties system so that the government there can deal with the cost, or just truck it away.  EDIT: and it turns out this is the exact fight they're having.  https://www.borderreport.com/news/environment/spacex-wants-to-dump-treated-sewage-water-into-texas-south-bay-coastal-preserve/  > SpaceX wants to dump treated sewage water into Texas’ South Bay coastal preserve",cipheron,2025-05-03T19:23:22,35

"> pumping the sewage away just far enough not to offend the wealthy inhabitants  The wealthy conservatives don’t live in shitholes like this. There’s a reason Joe Rogan and Elon, himself, moved to Austin instead of a rural small town or even Waco. There’s a reason the Fox News headquarters is in Midtown Manhattan. There’s a reason Ann Coulter has an apartment in LA and not Bakersfield.  The wealthy conservatives know that blue areas are the best places to live.",veggeble,2025-05-03T22:52:18,3
"> SpaceX wants to dump treated sewage water into Texas’ South Bay coastal preserve  This is a misreport.

Umm the entire way they work is by blasting that water into the air and on to the ground to protect the surface by absorbing sound energy. Much of it is vaporized.  How do you propose recovering water vapor?  It's also worth mentioning that SpaceX was already granted permission to do it months ago (during the previous admin).,ergzay,2025-05-04T20:55:32,1
