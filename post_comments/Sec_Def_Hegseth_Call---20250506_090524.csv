and the left thought that there would be no cuts at the Pentagon.  And 20% is roughly 8-9 people which feels like a lot for the left to be freaking out about.,Twogunkid,2025-05-06T16:35:33,10
Dump them and all of their staff. There are three General Officers in the Alaska Army Guard with a force that is less than Brigade. They don’t need one GO. They also have seven full Colonels. This is one example that is multiplied by every other state. Add all of the GOs/O6s that are Active Duty and some installations have more GOs/O6s than they have BN commanders.,Started_WIth_NADA,2025-05-07T02:31:58,3
"The sad reality is that there are plenty of corrupt four star generals that should not be in their position and care only about advancing their own personal interests. I've had personal experience with one of them in the past, and when his crimes were discovered, all he got was a slap on the wrist.",____IIIII___ll__I,2025-05-06T10:31:08,36
I would strongly prefer we cut a lot more but this is a good start.,deadzip10,2025-05-07T08:08:13,2
"Expect a judge to step in however and declare that she knows better than the Secretary of Defense and that changes to the number of four star generals violates the Administrative Procedures Act.  However, the judge will be overturned as he should. There is no place for a judge to be a political activist!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T10:25:12,20

It’s about time. The military has become increasingly top-heavy since the force structure was cut from Cold War levels. It seems that we could cut everything except swanky general officer billets.,PubliusVA,2025-05-06T10:59:36,0

Retiring as a 4 star and rapidly becoming a defense contractor's board member is becoming a career path all its own,StratTeleBender,2025-05-06T11:29:46,33
"During World War II the U.S. military had 17 four- and five-star generals and admirals. This included 13 four-star generals and 4 five-star generals. Today, there are 44 four-star generals.   Keep in mind that the US also had at its peak 16 million military personnel.",KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-05-06T09:50:56,52

"It should be noted that the US population has almost tripled since 1938. And the US is active across the planet, not just focused on two theaters of operations.",Batbuckleyourpants,2025-05-06T12:41:39,72
