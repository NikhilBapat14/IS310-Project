Lot of reversing course.  Turns out the current administration’s ideas and “policies” are deeply unpopular.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T12:28:54,24

"This isn’t a victory for reality over the project  This is a distraction   The project has moved on. It is testing the waters over nullifying the judiciary now.   The U.S. has failed every test so far, there has been no resistance at all to the loss of personal freedom. They know they can grab citizens and non-citizens alike and nothing happens. Soon they’ll know they can grab judges too.   Eventually they’ll go mask off and do it in numbers. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills here, the pattern is clear.",Drolb,2025-04-25T12:50:52,6

"1,500 international students thrown into chaos for a headline.  Reversed when the lawsuits hit — but the message is clear:  *They don’t see people. Just pawns.*",erg99,2025-04-25T12:46:55,2

The article I read seemed to say this is only the cancellations over minor legal issues - not the ones cancelled over protesting. Does anyone know more about those?,intensiveduality,2025-04-25T14:47:49,1
"The article suggests that these terminations were only reversed because they're working on a new set of policies:  >Joseph F. Carilli, a Justice Department lawyer, said that immigration officials had begun work on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students and that, until the process was complete, agencies would not make additional changes or further revocations.  Do we know anything about what these new policies might be?",EqualInevitable6729,2025-04-25T15:33:47,1

"What else can we expect from an administration that runs on ""concepts"" when Project 2025 doesn't explicitly lay out the authoritarian path for them? ;)   Did we even get an infrastructure week this time around?",xlvi_et_ii,2025-04-25T12:37:31,5

"Yeah I really can’t imagine a dumber move than to kick out students who are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be in the USA, to be come educated and productive members of our workforce. It is one of the most self destructive things they could do.",FlithyLamb,2025-04-26T15:03:25,2

They know exactly what they are doing; the next attempt will be even less humane.,theRealRudewing,2025-04-25T12:33:07,3
