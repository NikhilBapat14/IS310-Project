"There's a few ways to answer this, but the short answer is ""no""   First, there are state-level parties that are not called the Democratic Party. Example   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic%E2%80%93Farmer%E2%80%93Labor_Party   Second, parties can and do break up. See the Libertarians in 2022   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_USA   But finally, political parties don't have the degree of control you seem to think they do   The Pennsylvania Democratic Party is made up of State Committee Members and individual County Committees. The County Committees are make up of individual Precinct Committee Members   If members of the State or County leadership chose to join a different political party, they wouldn't dissolve their existing roles, they would vacate them, and the vacancies would be filled. And most Committee Members would - correctly - see such a move as nothing but a power play and tell the ex-Dems to go piss up a rope if they demanded the Committee Members now affiliate with them.   The new party would need to basically start from scratch from an organization perspective ",Objective_Aside1858,2025-03-15T17:54:01,33
Basically you lose access to their money and can’t use their name because it is trademarked so you’re essentially creating a new party.,j____b____,2025-03-15T23:10:09,9
"So, not American, but there's an interesting case in Canada where the BC provincial Liberal Party split off from the federal Liberal Party.  In fact, there is no BC Liberal party anymore, but for a while it was a twisted fusion of voters from the federal Liberal and Conservative parties.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_United",unkz,2025-03-15T22:00:28,3
"It seems like we should be having the conversation of establishing new parties/growing alternative ones. Between the binary choice and the unfettered money in our national politics, our system feels broken.  Wouldn't having 3+ parties with significant representation at the national level lead to more compromise/consensus? Many other western countries have elections with outcomes that result in power sharing or pragmatic solutions to problems as opposed to our polarized whipsaw.",TheElRay,2025-03-16T18:57:46,1
"Yes, just look at tusi gabard (i know i didn’t spell that right) she was a democratic veteran that changed her political affiliation when she decided the party wasn’t aligned with her beliefs.",Jen0BIous,2025-03-16T14:02:30,0

"Our system is broken. It's why I've been wondering about scenarios like this. America is a big country, and I feel like it needs more parties to accurately represent its population.",Livid_Passion_3841,2025-03-16T19:19:41,1
"I have also been thinking through many scenarios and feel let down by both sides. Why are there no national leaders urging this conversation? Now is the time to ask these questions, with the hopes of a moderating class of new representatives in the midterms. Until then we're locked into ineptness from all of our elected leaders.",TheElRay,2025-03-16T20:24:46,1
