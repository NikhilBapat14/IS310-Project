"A research facility within the US [National Institutes of Health](https://www.wired.com/tag/nih/) that is tasked with studying [Ebola](https://www.wired.com/tag/ebola/) and other deadly infectious diseases has been instructed by the Trump administration‚Äôs [Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.wired.com/story/department-health-human-services-possible-collapse/) to stop research activities.  According to an email viewed by WIRED, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was told to stop all experimental work by April 29 at 5 pm. The facility is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is located at the US Army base Fort Detrick. It conducts research on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that are deemed ‚Äúhigh consequence‚Äù‚Äîthose that pose significant risks to public health. It has 168 employees, including federal workers and contractors.  The email, sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, says the lab is terminating studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare but lethal mosquito-borne disease that has been reported in several Northern US states. ‚ÄúWe are collecting as many samples as is reasonable to ensure these studies are of value,‚Äù he says in the email. ‚ÄúWe have not been asked to euthanize any animals so these animals will continue to be managed.‚Äù Holbrook did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.  The email says representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were padlocking freezers in BSL-4 labs, those with the highest level of biosafety containment used for studying highly dangerous microbes. Only about a dozen BSL-4 labs exist in North America. These labs work with the viruses that cause Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg, types of hemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Research Facility is one of few places in the world that is able to perform medical imaging on animals infected with BSL-4 agents.

"In his own words, the brain worm doesn't accept germ theory, i.e. that disease is primarily caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; instead some hotchpotch of pre-microscope theories that basically says disease is caused by an improperly balanced body along with some 'bad air' juju thrown in.

Do you think Covid is gone because everyone decided it was gone and is that how pandemics end ?ü§î Are people masking there ?,finitefuck,2025-04-30T18:46:03,-1
"Masking is in decline, but many people do, including people who are sick with respatory infections.   I can't speak to Covid, as I'm not an expert in the field of infectious diseases. But I suspect we selected for a less deadly variant, and with widespread vaccination, we might have correlated immunities.¬†",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-30T18:59:35,2
"And there‚Äôs no way a less deadlier variant has occurred because no one is masking so it just keeps evolving.  Organ damage, brain damage etc etc  Edit: until there is a vaccine that can inoculate us from covid everyone is going to continue to get sick and sicker without their knowledge‚Ä¶ well until it‚Äôs too late.

I‚Äôm not an expert either but I know the current vaccines wane off after 3 months. I also know that more than half the cases are asymptomatic. I also know that Covid treats your immune system like HIV.,finitefuck,2025-04-30T19:03:23,-1
"Vaccination, properly applied, hits memory T-cells, which can survive decades.   HIV is different because it targets the mechanism white blood cells use to replicate, causing the full replication of HIV virus particles. What's how it progresses to AIDS - by destroying the immune system. That's why getting sick in conjunction with an HIV infection is especially dangerous.¬†",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-30T19:07:16,3

"You are saying things that people say because they don‚Äôt want to believe the truth. because if they do admit to these factual findings, it means they are in trouble.

"One of the challenges with Covid is that it is prone to mutating quickly, much like the Flu mutates quickly. That doesn't invalidate vaccination.  HIV (for example) is less prone to mutation with one exception: if any of the two main lines infect a single host, they may modify similar DNA segments, which may alter the effect of certain medications.",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-30T22:24:40,1
