">Countless people have left authoritarian countries for the promise of freedom and safety in the United States. NPR reached out to Koranyi and a dozen others to get their impressions of the Trump administration's first several months in power. Most — but not all — said some of the administration's tactics reminded them of those used by the regimes they fled.  >In fact, a survey in February found that hundreds of U.S.-based scholars think the United States is moving swiftly from a liberal democracy toward some form of authoritarianism.  >""This is an elected government, obviously, but it is behaving as an authoritarian one, "" says Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die. ""It is engaging in a rapid and systematic weaponization of the machinery of government and its deployment to punish rivals, to protect allies and to bully elements of the media.""",1900grs,2025-04-30T23:15:53,62

"My experience is similar but not exactly this. My grandma was taken from her home and placed in an Indian Residential School in Fort Frances, Ontario, not far from where the families were living at the time. The kids still had no idea what was happening or where they were being sent or why. It was a horrible experience, and I won’t go into the details too much as I’m sure most of you can fill in the blanks.   My focus is what this experience does to a person.   My mom endured abuse that I can’t even describe because it makes me sick to even write it out. My grandma was an angry, mean, abusive, alcoholic who I wasn’t allowed to see growing up. It wasn’t until I was in middle school that I was told about the residential schools & what they were about. I had talked to some elders who knew my grandma when she was young and they always told me that I would have loved her had I known her then. Being sent to that school ruined her life. And she died an angry, lonely death. I was in high school & my mom, for all the years of physical and emotional abuse she went through with my grandma…was there every second. My grandma never left her home the last 10-20 years of her life & the last 5 never left her room. She died weighing 89 pounds.   While my mom never did get the mother-daughter relationship she needed so much, she knew why my grandma was the way she was…but it took *me* a lot of time to understand this - and I’m guessing for those of you who had older relatives who went through this sort of trauma you felt this way too.   And there were many secrets. When I was told about my grandparents & the schools it was always ‘don’t tell anyone - don’t attach our names to this’ even though the residential schools were closed years ago, and lots of others were taken to them around here too. But as I discovered, through my grandma, misery doesn’t love company, and she didn’t want to talk to others who survived the schools, she didn’t want to know anything about it, she didn’t want to talk about it, and that was that. Mom was the same way, being that she was raised by grandma, she was told never to say anything to anyone about it.   I’ve made it my goal to learn as much about their lives as possible. Which is why this whole political climate we’re in right now is so frightening. There are so many similarities. And the people who should know better haven’t learned a damn thing.",jl56649,2025-05-01T06:09:42,6

"  >The electoral road to breakdown is dangerously deceptive. With a classic coup d’état, as in Pinochet’s Chile, the death of a democracy is immediate and evident to all. The presidential palace burns. The president is killed, imprisoned, or shipped off into exile. The constitution is suspended or scrapped.   >On the electoral road, none of these things happen. There are no tanks in the streets. Constitutions and other nominally democratic institutions remain in place. People still vote. Elected autocrats maintain a veneer of democracy while eviscerating its substance.   >Many government efforts to subvert democracy are “legal,” in the sense that they are approved by the legislature or accepted by the courts. They may even be portrayed as efforts to improve democracy—making the judiciary more efficient, combating corruption, or cleaning up the electoral process. Newspapers still publish but are bought off or bullied into self-censorship. Citizens continue to criticize the government but often find themselves facing tax or other legal troubles.   >This sows public confusion. People do not immediately realize what is happening. Many continue to believe they are living under a democracy. In 2011, when a Latinobarómetro survey asked Venezuelans to rate their own country from 1 (“not at all democratic”) to 10 (“completely democratic”), 51 percent of respondents gave their country a score of 8 or higher.  >Because there is no single moment—no coup, declaration of martial law, or suspension of the constitution—in which the regime obviously “crosses the line” into dictatorship, nothing may set off society’s alarm bells. Those who denounce government abuse may be dismissed as exaggerating or crying wolf.   >Democracy’s erosion is, for many, almost imperceptible.   ~Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point By Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt",SicilyMalta,2025-05-01T05:13:22,29
