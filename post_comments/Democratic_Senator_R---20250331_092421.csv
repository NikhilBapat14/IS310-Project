"Accuse isn’t what happened, they lied and need to be punished. Plain and simple.",Tricky-Spread189,2025-03-31T09:53:49,23
Everyone knows they're lying about this monumental fuck up. They want to obscure this scandal until they have another giant scandal. We are absolutely less safe in the US as no one will share classified information with us anymore.,jertheman43,2025-03-31T10:01:25,17
The ‘Intelligence’ Chiefs are full of BS.,EarlGrey1806,2025-03-31T09:34:12,8
You can't be hired by Trump if you won't lie under oath. It's a job qualification.  Give the guy with unlimited pardons criminal immunity and this is what you get.,realistdreamer69,2025-03-31T10:35:57,5

"To be fair, the IC community completely outclasses the entire world's intelligence. We export more intelligence then we import, by far. I doubt any country who relies on US intelligence can replace US intelligence.  See Ukraine and how quickly they started losing in the few days the US stopped intelligence sharing, and how no other country was able to fill in for the gap",Naticbee,2025-03-31T10:38:55,0
"As far as satellites go, yes. However, human resources are cultivated by many countries around the world. Just look at the signal texts to see that visual confirmation was made by a human asset. The US isn't the only country with those. Besides, what good is American intelligence if the Commander and Chief decides to not believe it and instead goes with Russian disinformation like Helsinki in 18?",jertheman43,2025-03-31T10:45:49,4
