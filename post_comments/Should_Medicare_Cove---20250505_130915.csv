"Golf fees and ski passes? No.   Pet supplies/food.... Maybe if it was for a service animal (not an ESA), but otherwise no.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-05T15:00:10,5
"No.  If anything, Medicare should provide cash which retirees could then use as they see fit.  We don't need to open up even more lobbying by industries vying to become a recipient for handouts.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-05T13:49:23,11

I don't like golf myself to begin with but if a Doctor explains how Golf somehow will prolong someone's life and keep them healthier for it then I might agree. If they show FACTUAL evidence and studies that prove it fine.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T13:11:58,5

Exercise and mental stimulation both very clearly do keep old folks healthy. Golf is an expensive way to get that but it clearly provides those,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-05T13:31:08,17
"Read the article, Golf Fees are just of many examples:  “Medicare is supposed to fund health-care services for elderly and disabled Americans. But poorly structured payments for Medicare Advantage—a program that pays private insurers to manage seniors’ health coverage—have led to taxpayer dollars increasingly being used for non-medical perks like golf equipment, ski passes, and pet supplies”  If one *walks* 18 holes 3+ times a week they’ll get in an OK-ish, very light walk in.  Which is infinitely better than sitting on your ass.  But one can do the exact same thing for free by talking a walk around your neighborhood, or a park, or if it’s not on a treadmill at home or a gym.    Our taxes don’t need to fund a new set of golf clubs.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T13:34:12,13

Yeah I certainly wasn't claiming you couldn't get the golf benefits from gardening or a combo like walking and playing guitar. Just that when compared to watching TV any of those activities extend healthy years remaining.,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-05T13:36:26,5
I didn't think you were claiming anything other than Golf is good exercise.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T13:39:24,2
