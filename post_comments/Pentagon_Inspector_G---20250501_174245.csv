"I still can't believe Trump made a fox news weekend host with a history of alcohol abuse secretary of defense.  There are plenty of spaces for spokespeople within the government, you don't have to make them sec of defense.  The defense department itself has media positions.  Sec of defense is an actual big boy job with daily security briefings, reports, budgets, staffing and managing actual military operation and deployment stuff. Working with internal US organisations like the CIA & state department and working with other countries on NATO, Ukraine, middle east, etc.  The fact that people like Trump watch tv and golf all day means there is actually MORE work for anyone in serious rolls.  The US gov is coasting on the deep state beurocrats, aka professionals who climbed the ranks on merit, but if anything happens we are fucked because you cannot run an organisation in a crisis without proper leadership.  Hegseth should never have been given and job and needs to go asap. He has zero credibility when it comes to classified information or anything else.",The_Frostweaver,2025-05-01T22:55:21,1

"This reminds me of when I hung out with Mr Hegseth… story time.  So, Pete was halfway through ripping a gator tail when his emotional support iguana launched itself onto the table, snatched the last of the 8-ball in its jaws. That fucker vanished out the doggy door like it had been planning this reptilian heist for weeks. Without a word, Pete chugged his beer, cleared the plate, and sprinted after it, yelling something about “reclaiming his destiny.” I just stood there, staring at the now coke-dusted iguana footprints on my kitchen table, wondering how things had escalated so fast. Two hours later, I got a selfie from Pete on a fishing dock, holding the iguana and grinning like he’d just won the Super Bowl. Still owes me a ball.",ReelNerdyinFl,2025-05-01T20:51:32,5
