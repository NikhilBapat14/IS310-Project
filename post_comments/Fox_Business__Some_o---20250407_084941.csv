The CNN Fear & Greed Index is clearly giving a thumbs down to Trump.   https://preview.redd.it/vjdbdawqefte1.jpeg?width=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4010ba93246306a318a36cd8209d467146e5684  CNN first devised the index back in 2012. It is tied to seven market indicators. CNN writes about the index's history [here](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/business/what-is-cnn-fear-and-greed-index/index.html).   Today it has been fluctuating between **3** and **4.** A year ago under Joe Biden it was at a healthy **58**.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-07T10:02:27,8
