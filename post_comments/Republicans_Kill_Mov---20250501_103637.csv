"> “How about this,” Representative Daniel Goldman raised. “Raise your hand if you do not think children with cancer who are American citizens should be deported.”Half of the hands in the room were raised. “Looks like it’s all the Democrats and none of the Republicans.”  What the actual fuck",CT1914Clutch,2025-05-01T12:38:06,93
"The. Are. All. Fucking. Nazis.   There are no good Nazis. A quiet Nazi is still a Nazi. Even a Nazi who does not vote with the Nazi Party is still a fucking Nazi for staying in the party. Time for ""The Nazi Hunters"".",williamgman,2025-05-01T10:54:20,130
Citizens cannot be deported.  The correct word is *exile*.,Caraes_Naur,2025-05-01T11:15:56,84
"If a masked, unidentified individual claims they’re a “federal agent” but won’t show you identification or a warrant, and they are trying to grab you or someone off the street…then they are just kidnappers, and as a citizen your 2A rights will really help stop a kidnapping.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-01T15:08:04,11
Why do Republicans hate the constitution and America?,ClassicHando,2025-05-01T15:35:20,9
"They can try to stop it all they want, it won't change the facts...you cannot just 'deport' US Citizens.  They are kidnapped and at best exiled to another country or at worst illegally imprisoned in a foreign country",chriskot123,2025-05-01T16:07:37,6
"Much better title than what’s been sent around so far. Republikkklans suck, but I’m glad to have a much more accurate headline going around.",jgoble15,2025-05-01T15:17:38,3
Every Republican is a traitor to this country. That is all.,whoibehmmm,2025-05-01T23:42:10,3
"This is what happens when you normalize the idea of deportations, which both parties did when it comes to illegal or undocumented immigrants. You open the doors to where Republicans can now make up a justification for deporting anyone really. This is why the Democrats folding and conceding to the idea that “deportations are necessary (for illegals)” is the biggest misstep they’ve made in the past decade.",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-01T10:41:59,21

The biggest misstep?,Equivalent-Excuse-80,2025-05-01T10:50:26,8
“But you can’t take me.  I’m one of you ! I voted to disappear them not us” Plea’s of random House/Senate member after forgetting Barrons Bday.,AKBud,2025-05-02T03:43:26,1
"A small part of the ""tough on crime"" mindset that goes all the way back to Nixon's ""war on drugs"".  For decades democrats played along in fomenting the undercurrent of fear and distrust among the people.",Caraes_Naur,2025-05-01T11:20:54,9
"Maybe not necessarily THE biggest, but big enough for us to see its impact on the current environment in the US. Millions of people are afraid to even leave their house, fearing they’d be thrown in some prison eternally, all because they haven’t yet signed that piece of paper",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-01T10:54:52,4
"Blames dems for things Republicans do,  classic",Complete-Pangolin,2025-05-01T11:30:19,4
"What we are coming to is a point where citizens, men, women and children can be taken off the street by anyone, sex traffickers, serial killers, claiming to be undercover. Will we stand in the parking lot and gawk, maybe make a TikTok and go on about our business? Next stop Dystopia. Everyone will be afraid to leave their house.",citymousecountyhouse,2025-05-02T04:09:55,1
"The gop creates polling, the dems chase it. So yeah the gop cries about how we need to be tough on crime and how dangerous everything constantly and people start thinking it’s a problem. The dems then see that people think it’s a problem and then try to show they are tough on crime too",SpaceLemming,2025-05-01T17:27:24,4
"No. It’s more like blaming Dems for not unconditionally standing against the things Republicans support. When the Harris Walz campaign said that they would support building a wall in front of Mexico, this is an example of them not only failing to oppose Trump’s position on that, but actually them even adopting his wall position as a concession, as a way to surrender to the Republicans.",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-01T13:16:22,7
