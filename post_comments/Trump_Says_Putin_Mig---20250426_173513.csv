"There are few options left:  World War 3  Give them Ukraine/Crimea  EU stops buying their oil, oil prices skyrocket worldwide for everyone but the big 3 baddies, China, North Korea, and Russia",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-26T18:41:51,-32
"No! We CAN’T AFFORD to escalate! This is not America’s war, and if Trump starts getting hostile, it quickly will be!",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-26T19:56:29,-63
"The problem with that is gas and oil prices go up for all of us, well other than China and India, who'll get even cheaper fuel.  Unless you can convince OPEC to massively increase output equal to Russia's.   Eight now Russian fuel is capped in price. Third parties buy it at almost cost, then resell it to Europe and others.  This keeps global prices stable while still harming Russia's economy.   We've more or less done all of the sanctions we can do. Start handing over seized Russian assets to Ukraine and start giving and selling weapons again. Maybe even a short term significant boost in arms to let Putin know we're serious.    The only economic things we can do would have to be aimed at China and India, and unfortunately we've already tariffed China to hell, so they'll be increasing support to Russia, and aren't likely to respond to more economic threats from us.",cathbadh,2025-04-27T07:16:35,18
