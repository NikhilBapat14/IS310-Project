"Excerpts:  ...Marc Elias, a former Perkins Cole partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, called Trump's executive orders an assault on the entire legal profession live on air.  ""Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system,"" Elias, who first crossed Trump in 2016 when he served as the top lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign and then again in 2020 when he defeated the businessman's efforts to contest the election results in court, declared.  Elias then went on to liken the commander-in-chief to ""a mob boss"" who is intimidating people in a neighborhood, saying, ""The fact is that these law firms are being told, 'If you don't play ball with us, maybe something really bad will happen to you.'""  A federal judge permanently blocked the executive order against the law firm last week, calling it ""unconstitutional retaliation."" Nevertheless, Trump has targeted other law firms that bring immigration lawsuits or other cases against the government that he deems to be unethical.",D-R-AZ,2025-05-05T08:53:35,341

"I've regained some respect for 60 Minutes. Watched it all my life, but stopped watching most weeks after they gave MTG airtime. Sanewashing bullshit, but if they want to flip the finger to Trump 2.0, I'll be right there with them.",PNWoutdoors,2025-05-05T09:26:11,99

"Mob boss: ""These neighborhood businesses wouldn't pay for protection if they didn't need it, we're just providing a service like the police.""  New York City 2nd-rate TV celebrity and nepo baby: ""These law firms wouldn't pay me millions of dollars if they didn't believe they did something wrong - which is why I threatened to ban them from practicing law in courtrooms.""",YallerDawg,2025-05-05T10:17:55,33
Thanks. I'll watch it right away. Good for 60 minutes.   I did watch.  Very good. 60 minutes does give time to Trump defense but the lawyers that spoke were exactly right. Destroying the Judicial branch equals dictatorship.,Laura9624,2025-05-05T10:42:34,26

"Marc Elias does such great work and is one of those people whose cause is so worth donating to, not plugging him per se, just that the guy fights-in-court the good fight for the rest of us",AlphaNoodlz,2025-05-05T09:25:13,145
"> ""Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system,""  That is such a concise and accurate description.   He's also everything that is wrong with America's corporate system and our system of Justice. His companies rip people off while paying him massive amounts of money then he just sends the companies into bankruptcy so he never has to pay people what he owes and keeps the money for himself with accounting tricks. And he breaks law after law and uses his money to outlast people in court who sue him and to bribe his way out of criminal charges.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-05T11:59:22,47

That's too bad because the MTG segment was very good and fully exposed her as a horrible person. I never understood the twitter hate against 60 Minutes for that. I thought it was an excellent expose.,CeilingUnlimited,2025-05-05T13:56:48,20

"Marc Elias will probably never enter politics (as in run for something) but he’s fighting harder against Trump than almost anyone, and his integrity is off the charts. They offered him almost a billion dollars to back off and he turned it down. He smartly entered media to get his message out as widely as possible. He’s a fucking hero. A lot of people don’t know how many legal challenges he’s successfully mounted against Republican malfeasance.",rjrgjj,2025-05-05T14:37:20,65
