"I couldn’t care less if he was deported again, so long as he is granted the due process required by the Constitution. If you follow the process, then there isn’t much reason to be upset about it. When you ignore the law, people get pissed.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-30T08:13:46,36

"Which is the correct way for this to happen I have a spoiler alert at the bottom so don’t read that if you’re not wanting to know the ending. Trump was told this twice in 2019 and instead of dealing with it the Administration just released this “dangerous” person with a work permit. He got a job and joined a union. I am not a lawyer but the court said he can be deported but just not to El Salvador. So Noem has to present to the court where he’d be deported too. He isn’t a criminal so sending him to a prison is not an answer. Probably why they released him in 2019.   Spoiler President Trump loves to slander and defame people. This time it is we the people that will pay. Me. Garcia was deported because of a clerical error per the US Government and all the other stuff came after the fact. Trumps DOJ & DHS did not make these claims in 2019 and yet using the exact same information as before but the arresting officer is fired, the police department has said they have evidence of any criminal wrongdoing or gang activity this DOJ and DHS under the same Precedent has dug in and slandered this family, ignored the 2019 court order and appellate court order, the 2025 lower courts and Supreme Courts orders just to defend a clerical error.   That didn't happen.  And if it did, it wasn't that bad.  And if it was, that's not a big deal.  And if it is, that's not my fault.  And if it was, I didn't mean it.  And if I did, you deserved it. (We are here in the narcissistic prayer phase and it doesn’t cost the people who are messing up a dime, just the taxpayers). This is not MAGA, Law & Order and if it can happen to Mr. Garcia and they can turn 70 million people against you and due process then this isn’t America.",Morepastor,2025-04-30T09:52:02,2
"I am fine with this, but they also better have a full fledged hearing regarding his alleged status as a member of a gang before they send him to a supermax prison for the rest of his life.  They want to deport him after due process then fine, we all knew the Trump admin would act that way if he was ever returned.  However, anyone that you're going to send to a supermax prison better have been convicted of crimes that warrant such a punishment.    Actually, that practice should just stop entirely.  No court is sentencing these people to this prison and with that being the case, no one should go there.  Full stop.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-30T09:00:52,4

"Could you imagine the lawsuit he could wrap the US government up in for these ""official"" acts if he did get back & they couldn't fabricate another reason to deport him?

"Sad news is that no immigration proceeding gets true due process. Ever seen the hearings with lone kids and/or people who don't even speak English with no aid present, let alone legal representation? It's because immigration proceedings are ""administrative"" and not ""judicial"", and they only have the executive serving as prosecution, judge, and jury. A mockery of due process, and it was like this long before Trump.",henryptung,2025-04-30T16:12:08,2

Americans have no stomach for it. We let Nixon walk away from Watergate. We let Reagan and Bush Sr walk away from the Iran Contra. We are horrendous at completing the necessary actions to maintain civility and propriety. The best we'll get is the admin ousted by hopefully unmeddled with elections and the faces reappearing as interviewers and talk show personalities on grifter networks.

"If non-citizens do not get due process, then citizens also do not get due process.  I am assuming you are also an American-born citizen. If non-citizens do not get due process, the government just has to point to you and say you are not a citizen to deport you.  What are you going to do about it? As you are labeled a non-citizen, you do not get due-process to even establish that you are actually a citizen.",blu-bells,2025-04-30T07:59:16,31

"All people, not just citizens get due process. Read the constitution.

Every person on US soil gets the benefit of due process according to the constitution. It’s very clear about it and it’s been upheld multiple times. It’s pretty much a defining characteristic of our nation.   The 2nd amendment gets a lot of credit for stopping government tyranny but in most cases it’s due process that is the real safeguard.,No_big_whoop,2025-04-30T08:00:17,8
