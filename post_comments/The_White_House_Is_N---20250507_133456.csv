"The insane part of this whole thing is that Greenland would happily share information, resources and allow military personnel in their country (as they have in the past, because.. that's what allies do..), but that's not good enough for Trump. The fact that he's destroying all of what has already been established just to forcefully take over Greenland is absolutely fucking terrifying.     At this rate I'm assuming the US will give Greenland an ultimatum in the next ~2 years, and then they'll end up in a full blown proxy war with whoever offers to help defend Greenland. Trump obviously isn't letting this one go and the spying accusations, if true, are a huge escalation and proof that he's willing to be a fucking idiot and actually invade.",Soupdeloup,2025-05-07T14:43:34,121

"Consider the population of Greenland and then question how much power the US Intelligence Agencies need to expend on that small of a population. I seriously think the need to drop Intelligence from their name. The issue won't be Greenland. It will be the rest of the world's nations who respect sovereign nations because when you start thinking might makes it right, that is when you end up fighting in long wars. The US will have less friends than it does now and Russia and China will have no choice but to expect further expansion jeopardizing global peace.",Stonkasaurus1,2025-05-07T17:47:37,1

"This.  Until January there was possibly a diplomatic route for the US to have Greenland under de facto military control, while keeping an autonomous Greenlandic state subsidized by Denmark.  But now‚Ä¶?  Best case: The US shows up in overwhelming force and stays in theater, enough to deter Denmark, Nordics, the EU (France!) and the UK from any military response. The Canadian border must be manned to make sure they sit still if the US needs to violate their air/sea in case of the conflict going hot.  Arctic logistics while under EU, Canadian (and more) embargoes sounds fun. The US military should be capable of solving this, but it might cripple their ability for serious response to anything else happening around the world. All while an attack on a NATO country likely will eliminate most responses if the US toots that article 5 themselves at a later stage.  Nice way to tell Asia ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre busy, have fun‚Äù I guess.

We're surrounded by light all the time, even at night. If you're ever out in the pitch black wilderness with darkness that swallows up the shine from your flashlight after a few yards, listening to the rustle of leaves and the cracks of twigs in the night, you'll realize that the fear is still there. Fear of what you can't see or understand or predict.   Some people carry that fear with them even in the light. They fear people of different cultures and backgrounds, technologies they don't understand, change itself; and they cling to the institutions that reject all these scary, frightful, uncertain things and tell them that they'll make them better. Humans are simply slightly clever monkeys, and some express their primal animalistic fears more strongly than others; and there are clever, selfish monkeys that learned to take advantage of that from the very earliest days of civilization.",Omegoa,2025-05-07T17:50:21,11

That is to say, he encouraged a bit of initiative on the part of noncoms, so that if they found themselves without a superior officer, they would be able to take up command and continue to fulfill their mission.   The oppressed nations of the Old Warsaw pact where operating on the Russian model. And so when the Soviet Union lost control, the Eastern block fell apart. NATO is built more along the lines that Napoleon envisioned. The United States has enjoyed the appellation ""leader of the Free World"" since the second World War, but our allies are independent nations. They choose to work together because they have a common interest and purpose, and the United States, for all of our influence, is not their master.

"Well put.  I know many folks whom I had previously considered to be smart people who quite readily fell into the F*ck Trudeau mindset during the Canadian election once their social media started to actively target them.  They weren't and probably aren't full on MAGA assholes, but they certainly became very vocal about a particular candidate during our election.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how many folks who I thought would fall victim to the propaganda machine didn't vote for PP.  My father-in-law is a prime example.  Watches Fox, follows several ""soft-right"" Facebook groups, hated Trudeau's immigration policies, mildly racist, not very well educated.  During the election he still voted Liberal because he was smart enough to see the Conservative message for what it was.   While your point about the American education system being average may be true, the results of that education system are abysmal when you look at what skills a society needs to be able to resist misinformation.  We've all seen the stat from 2022 that says that 54% of adults in the US have reading comprehension skills below a 6th grade level.  Now the new rulers in the US are actively working to tear down anything that was good in the existing system.  Denmark, on the other hand, usually ranks within the top 5 of global education system rankings.  Greenland's education system is based on the Danish system with adaptations for the cultural needs of the local population.  If the supposition that far-right or populist movements rely on poorly educated populations to spread their message is true, then this should make Greenland a very hard target.

Our species is the apex of life on this planet because we learned greater traits like empathy, compassion, and trust. These are the traits that allowed us to leave the trees, wander as a group, and eventually start growing food - these attribute are the fundamental foundation of civilization itself.
