"They said the same about allowing black soldiers fight. They said the same thing about gay soldiers. And now this. If transgender soldiers can be banned look out military, we might be banning anyone who  is not a straight, white male because that ruling basically allows for that.",ItsHammyTime2,2025-05-06T13:42:53,19

Iâ€™m confused. We have allowed fat and obese cops throughout the United States forever. And no one has ever complained. But now they want to ban transgender soldiers? What about them being trans makes them unfit to be soldiers?,DavidC_M,2025-05-06T15:52:00,5

"Nope! Everyone, don't even think of bringing this up in other subs! Please just stick to reminding Trump's followers about how he said he was going to get prices down on day one, then proceeded to take actions that will do the exact opposite of that. Also, he made us, the most powerful nation in the world, look like a patsy for a communist dictator (let alone ending the war on day one). The want us to argue social issues. They know how to do that. They get a little squeamish (the best you can hour for with these nuts) when you point out they were bamboozled (said he'd make things cheaper, did the opposite) and now the stock market is crashing and the whole damn economy is about to meltdown. They also can't really talk their way out of it being shoved in their face that we, the goddam arsenal of democracy and city on the hill, are kissing Russia's ass (Reagan would be rolling over in his grave, and they know it).

They never go forward. What youâ€™re describing is the Democratsâ€™ idea of bipartisanship. They vote with the Repulsives to pass 30 regressive bills to every one centrist bill and claim the year a win for progress.,bikesnkitties,2025-05-06T13:37:49,23

I will never forgive the leftists who told me things couldn't get worse under Trump than they already were under Biden.,Areyounobody__Too,2025-05-06T13:29:46,11
"Most of the ""both sides are the same"" come from ""enlightened centrists"" who think neither the left nor the right should be allowed to be in control. Much of the ""Biden wasn't good enough"" were inundated in right-wing propaganda which stated Democrats won't do anything for labor/Palestine/economy.  The problem is, Democrat leadership never made concerted effort to actually fight against the propaganda, and in many ways, publicly leaned into it. It was either ""we're above all that"" or ""it's complicated"" which is how you piss off pretty much everyone who is an actual voter.  They tried to appeal to high-income whites with charts and data, not realizing that most of those never cared about the data, only about maintaining the social order.  At quite literally all costs.",ragingreaver,2025-05-06T14:12:09,2
"Hopefully the democrats have learned their lesson and will actually try to earn the votes of leftists for once. Otherwise we have no reason to vote for them. ""Not being maga"" isn't a good enough reason",Angedelanuit97,2025-05-06T13:30:51,-1

"Those people are certified morons.  I am a leftist. I don't like Biden. To claim that a massively predictable backslide is no worse or the same as perpetuating the status quo you disagree with is so dumb it hurts.  ""Guess I'll drink bleach since I wasn't able to get my favorite soda"" type energy  Edit: this isn't at people who don't feel the Democrats haven't earned their vote, because frankly, they haven't. It's at people who conflate that with the idea that somehow both sides are equally hell, which is simply not true.",aroslab,2025-05-06T15:17:32,1
"I'm not sure what's up with this ""kick myself in the nuts to punish the Dems"" sentiment. do they seem punished to you? they ended up trying to go _even further right_, they clearly have no interest in trying to persuade anyone further than center-left.  don't get it twisted, I'm not a fan of the democratic platform, but when the choices are ""obvious authoritarian backslide"" and ""perpetuate the bad status quo"", it seems like an obvious choice to me.  Purity contests don't bring about change, and piling on even more work just makes it even harder to drive towards real progress.",aroslab,2025-05-06T15:33:39,3
"If someone sat out on voting because ""the democrats didn't earn your vote,"" they're just as culpable and deserve just as much scorn.  This train wreck was preventable, but all the harm that was clearly coming wasn't enough of a motivator to stop it. Hope the fucking purity was worth it to them as the full weight of the federal government is now targeting people like me to eradicate us from public life.  The end result is exactly the same, and they can now live with their continued failure to grasp at and hold any meaningful power in this country.",Areyounobody__Too,2025-05-06T17:45:25,1
"Hereâ€™s the problem with all of these Realpolitik centrist takes.   They arenâ€™t.   The right has been building a radical base and shift further right and they have been gaining more and more power.   The left has been shifting to the centre and losing power.   But letâ€™s look at the actual strategy this argument implies. you want millions of essential complete strangers to behave as a monolith to do something for little reward.    Which is supposedly far easier than a few thousand people who all work for the same organization to change and behaviour as is part of their jobs.   All in the service of a grander strategy that has not only failed but has created the very building blocks for the rightâ€™s abuse of power.  The democrats helped build the war on terror, the tough on crime, immigration deportations systems that are going to be used to move the USA further in fascism.   And did they win the tough on crime, tough on imagination, military power voteâ€¦ nope.    The system is broken, the replication of society is failing and because we have completely erased the ability for society to change all that is left is rightwing othering.   Fascism will continue to rise around the world because Neo liberalism has destroyed the ability to even imagine anything different.   Sure Neo Liberalism is better than fascism but sticking with Neo liberalism will result in fascism.",sexisfun1986,2025-05-06T16:20:38,-1
Cool. I think differently and won't be voting for the democrats unless they earn my vote. It's pretty simple and 100 percent up to them. I hope they find a way to earn my vote but they haven't yet,Angedelanuit97,2025-05-06T15:38:31,-1
"That's your prerogative, I just don't think they will any time soon.   IMO they have shown they will literally die clinging on to their seats before they offer even table scraps for appeasement to truly ""left"" policies. And without an understanding of the merits of leftist policy among average voters, it's incredibly likely that whoever comes next will be cut from the same cloth.  Unless leftists are proactive in educating people and putting forward genuinely progressive candidates, I have no faith that Democrats will _ever_ come around. Waiting for them to do so seems like an exercise in futility.",aroslab,2025-05-06T16:11:53,0
