Their food is overpriced and unhealthy. Not surprised.,cockyrichard250,2025-05-02T00:16:00,39
"the only reason mcdonalds exist internationally is because people are amused by kitsch americana. but, if they do not have a good image of america to begin with, all mcdonalds really offers is poison.   i'd be ok if trump ruined mcdonalds. if mcdonalds went completely bankrupt and all those franchise locations owners had to instead rebrand into a real restaurant that served real food, the entire planet would be better for it.",Virbillion,2025-05-02T00:19:46,22
"""Anti-American"" sentiment... ahem, I think you mean not supporting companies that are supportive of actively fascist regimes.   Also, wasn't Trump the Big Mac spokesperson for their cheeseburders after his fake drive-thru photo op during his campaign to try to beat Kamala's claim to working there while obtaining her undergraduate degree.  “I love McDonald’s,” Trump said. “I like to see good jobs, and I think it’s inappropriate when somebody puts down all over the place that she worked at McDonald’s.”  https://time.com/7095424/donald-trump-mcdonalds-love-campaign-kamala-harris-work-history/",Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T00:29:14,19
Trump has been a disaster for US branded companies selling products and services abroad. He's been displaying to the world the worst side of America (incredibly bad PR) and on top of that foreign countries are now imposing larger tariffs on US products.,platanthera_ciliaris,2025-05-02T00:33:33,9
It cost almost as much to eat there as it does a real restaurant so I'll just choose a real restaurant every time. Course since the prices of everything doubled and eating out a whole lot less.,UnexpectedAnomaly,2025-05-02T01:32:35,10
Price is up food quality sucks and you get less of it compared to BK or almost anywhere else.. And now cost of everything is skyrocketing.. Yeah..,FlyingRock,2025-05-02T00:28:06,7

I cant speak for anyone else but since they took the BEC biscuits off the value menu last year ive stopped eating there. I can make ( better ) sausage muffins at home for 1/4 of the price.,ceiffhikare,2025-05-02T04:09:29,2

"Last time i went to McDs, i paid at the back window and then sat at the front window for 5 minutes before someone came over and asked why i was there.  They lost my order after i paid.   The food was cold, the hamburger dry, the fries were in a 1/2 full box and a soggy mess.",Derbesher,2025-05-02T08:46:36,1
"Even with that I still would go through the drive-thru for breakfast to pick up a coffee and some hash browns.  But then McDonald's corporate decided to endorse a goddamn Trump campaign event at one of their locations,  so fuck them forever. I'm not going to reward them for actively helping to destroy this country and everything I care about in it.",Deinosoar,2025-05-02T04:21:56,18
I needed a snack on the road today.  Bought large fries and it was just under $5.  Holy crap Batman!,Am_I_AI_or_Just_High,2025-05-02T02:09:56,3
"I’m an American living abroad. My kids like McDonald’s and so we occasionally indulge them. As I’m traveling around Europe, on my travel days specifically when I haven’t the spoons to explore, I’ll sometimes grab McDonald’s on my way to crashing at my hotel just to see what each country has at their McDonald’s.  Food quality at European McDonald’s is actually much better than in the US, generally. I mean don’t get me wrong, it’s still not great food and quite unhealthy, but it’s not quite as _egregious_ elsewhere.  In my town in the Netherlands, the local McDonald’s is a popular Friday night treat for a lot of families with younger kids, maybe once or twice a month, and it’s a very popular hangout spot with teenagers over the weekend.  But you can definitely see a big drop off in crowd sizes in the last couple of months. The teenagers are generally still around in similar numbers, but the young families aren’t there anywhere near as much.",deVliegendeTexan,2025-05-02T05:45:10,2
He doesn’t seem to understand that if you say that your own country only wants to consume your own brands that maybe other countries will also decide they only want to consume their own brands.  ,After-Distribution69,2025-05-02T01:03:38,7
