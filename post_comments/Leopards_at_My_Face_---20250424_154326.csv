"Trump said P2025 wasn't ""his"" platform.  Trump ""says"" a lot of things.  Learning the blatant liar is a liar must be a hard pill to swallow.",RogueNiao,2025-04-24T16:58:45,92

You unite through hate and oppression and somehow you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd turn around and bite you?? It is what happens when you pretend that you‚Äôre religious and you do evil in the name of God. God never taught hate.,Potato2266,2025-04-24T22:01:11,9

"Trp lies about EVERYTHING. When will they get this? It's not even words to him. It's merely warmed, halitosis fragranced air, shaped into vibrations from a tiny, cracked tongue that form sounds that other, very misguided, people understand as language and interpret as something intelligent and rational.  You cannot build life choices around this man.",eggybread70,2025-04-25T02:33:07,6

"‚ÄúThat was the information I had‚Äù sir, no. You had the project 2025 information at your fingertips, you just chose to believe the biggest liar on the planet when he said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it. Now he‚Äôs checking off that list at a rapid pace. It‚Äôs not about you not voting in ‚Äúmy party‚Äù it‚Äôs you choosing to ignore all the red flags we desperately tried to show all of you and you all turning a blind eye saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs running on, he won‚Äôt actually do that, he‚Äôs just blowing smoke.‚Äù Never knew the leopards would be feasting so damn good so damn quickly",travel_witch,2025-04-25T07:09:14,3

"That's precisely the wrong attitude to have.  If people are serious about getting rid of this administration, and quickly, it's precisely supporters who are turning on Trump that we need onside.   It's precisely this kind of thinking that creates the identity threat that polarises people, created the problem we face, and perpetuates it.   Things are to urgent to indulge in schadenfreude.",McRattus,2025-04-25T03:07:40,6
