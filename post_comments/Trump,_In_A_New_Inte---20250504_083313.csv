"If this has to do with Abrego Garcia, he received his due process. Make no mistake, if there’s anyone who doesn’t believe in due process it’s democrats. These dumb liberals who are throwing a fit everyday because they don’t know what they’re talking about, believe that due process means a jury trial, it doesn’t. Due process means equal and fair treatment under the law. Liberals don’t want fair and equal, they want the rules tilted in their favor. From social media guidelines, to crying foul about the electoral college, all the way up to calling SCOTUS being illegitimate unless Biden packed the courts, they do NOT want fair and equal.",Asap5_0,2025-05-04T18:47:01,-6

"This man will never see a consequence for any of his actions, sadly.  I once had hope. I once believed he would spend the rest of his days in prison, where he belongs.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court had other ideas, making sure that they drove it home that there are two tiers of Justice in America, and that the President is above the Justice System (that they themselves head). Why they did that? The world will never know. It was the second worst ruling they ever made. But, they did it.  And now, the United States gets to suffer for it, as authoritarian after authoritarian is going to run for the Presidency, and they're going to destroy the election process rather than going back to democracy. And they will be immune, because the Supreme Court said so.",hackingdreams,2025-05-04T14:09:24,17
