"I'll take a swing at this.  My pops passed away when I was in the 8th grade and Social Security Insurance ensured that me, my sister, and immigrant mother had a shot in this world. It was definitely more than my dad paid in and it saved our family even though he had decent life insurance. The same benefit that Paul Ryan benefitted from and wanted to remove from everyone else, btw, because he was rich enough that it was extra money to them. The government kept its promise to my father by ensuring his family always had some form of resources until we turned 18.  I had a pretty bad stuttering problem when very young and the special classes I got to attend through the public school system. I was then able to communicate with my classmates better which improved my grades which led to actual academic achievement and success. The government fulfilled its obligation to provide a safe learning environment and even let me play sports on its dime, as well. Anecdotal, but it appears that on a mass scale the government is largely delivering on this promise. We're not pumping out geniuses, but that's not the mission. We rate well, on average, with our world peers.  During my time in the Navy I was taught how to operate a nuclear reactor by a group with zero incidents since being bestowed the responsibility of operating and maintaining nuclear power plants above and below the surface of the water. Imagine an organization that has been training 18 year olds from all levels of education to safely qualify to stand watch over literally the power center of one of the largest nuclear arsenals or air wings in the world.  This government has maintained the USA as the cultural power center of the world for many decades. It has lost its luster, especially amongst peers, but few countries represent a positivity that radiates beyond the slimy sheen. This is not just because of the Hollywood and its reach, our products get everywhere because our government opens and maintains these channels.  I will freely state this government sucks in a ton of ways and as a small business owner I assure you the suck is extended to that world, as well. It's just that the alternative is businesses and the rich getting away with whatever they want and I'm not down with that. Government should fill the gaps of services not provided by the commercial markets and society's protections against the whims of the rich.",controlroomoperator,2025-03-07T17:14:40,34

"Government is like a hammer. You can build wonderful things with it… or you can bash in skulls. It’s less about the concept of government and more about who is driving it.  Ultimately, I believe any form of government works… in theory (except those based on subjugation, slavery, racism, sexism, etc.). The problem each form of government has is that *people are involved*. A king can be an amazing ruler that is adored by the people, but he can also be cruel. It’s all about the person.  Ultimately, eventually, someone bad will come along. The benefit of a unitary executive is they can fix things fast… but they can also corrupt things fast. If you decentralize, then things change slower; it’s slower to fix things, but it’s also slower to corrupt.  I think America is seeing the whiplash of going from decades of gridlock as a decentralized government to the speed of a unitary executive. That particular individual, in my opinion, is not a good person, so it has some devastating ramifications.  Governments aren’t good or bad at anything. They’re exactly as effective as the people who run them.",Arkmer,2025-03-07T17:18:36,3

"Government does well on the macro scale - provision of **big** projects like highways, or **big** services like defence - where every stage of the project has to be uniform. A rail line crossing several states, for example, would be useless if the track gauge kept changing.

Government can do things effectively and efficiently when Republicans will stop trying to poison the well every single damn time!  That is the biggest problem by far. Every time Republicans get in control they gut funding. They put in ridiculous requirements. They put people in charge who are incompetent. They put people in who are corrupt. They put in people who hate the entire mission of the organization and work directly against it. And all of it is deliberate in an effort to make it so awful people will agree to kill it and privatize it.,Dell_Hell,2025-03-07T16:35:52,10
"Corporations need to make a profit - so they cut service , and raise the price.   Besides the fact that many inventions/medicines are developed in universities with federal money, and they won't be big profitable blockbusters like ED drugs -   In America a package or letter can be mailed from an obscure backwoods town in Alabama all the way to a village in Alaska.   Don't think a private service is going to do that unless the cost is astronomical. Why would they? They are not in business to make citizens' lives better.   Police and firefighters by subscription? Maybe trump will hire all those pardoned violent militia who bought a gun and promised retribution as soon as they stepped out of prison.   Look at almost every small town.  Go to Google maps and do a close view. What do you see? A post office, a school, a library.  ( Yes even libraries get federal funds.)     You think private schools are going to set up in some little shit town? Especially after fed funds go away and there's no longer a board of ed.

"It depends how you define ""well"" - meaning maximizing cost-effectiveness? Then in many (but not all) cases, private sector may do better, but when it comes to things like swift emergency response, or dependable dam repairs, etc, I'd say cost is a lesser priority than life-saving and public safety. All depends on what are the priorities of any given service.  And tbh it also depends on what you mean by ""government"" too, the US federal government, local government, international/any government bodies, etc?  Also it sounds like you're talking mostly about services that are calculated in govt budgets, but there is also the higher level stuff like law-making, adjudicating, etc. Personally don't think outsourcing any of that would be wise.  Basically it depends on how any given society is prioritizing - personally I think that for most of the services the govt currently provides, a less cost-effective public service is preferable over a cost-saving private one (within reason - if/when the level of service begins deteriorating, I think governments need a better means of improvement). The main reason is because in a private system with the pay gap between executives and low level workers, a good portion of the public money will go to the executives, furthering that gap, and the money will go into investment portfolios, stock options, real estate that mostly just inflates your rent as the 1% hoards more of it, etc rather than circulating back into the local economy, as would happen if the bulk of the cost was going directly to the ground level staff.",peetnice,2025-03-07T17:50:52,5

The only things the Government does ""Well"" are the things that quite literally cannot be done by the private sector.  The issue with that idea is that there's not really any evidence that they do them ""Well"", it's simply a lack of anything to compare it to.  There is no private sector for International Peace Treaties and the like...so we don't really know that the Government does it well...we just accept that they're the only ones that do it.

"I had the pleasure of doing a video call with an astronaut aboard the ISS in coordination with my school's Aerospace club. I'm not the clubs advisor but I'm in the science department and was aware of it so I stuck around.  Among many other interesting things he commented on how governments are good at taking risks, especially with human lives. You don't want private industry risking lives, nor does private industry want to engage in that. Without governments pushing space exploration, it's not something that would have developed at the rate it did. Instead, the governments of the world used their massive piles of resources to put human beings in harm's way to get us there. Over time, they minimized risk well enough to where now private industry feels like they can start trying to get into low Earth orbit and begin making that process more efficient. Next step for the governments of the world is to minimize risk getting to the moon. Then private industry will follow. After that, Mars.

"You have to define ‘well’   Also are we talking specifically about US government or governments in general?

As far as programs, I would say BLM does a great job, the SEC and FDA are pretty efficient, obviously our military is in a league of its own although is this done ‘well’ given the incredible cost?

"So many of these replies are missing the plot entirely.    So many misguided opinions built on the false assumption that the purpose of government is politics ( rather than policy)  If you're looking for any useful answer at all, you need to define ""government"" first. There is no sense in having government for its own sake. We gotta start from the top down, not bottom up.   What are we solving for as we consider a concept like 'government""?   What is the role of government and what do we need it to do?  Is the government there to serve the people? Or are the people there to serve the government?  Do we want absolute democracy where the people govern themselves ? Or do we prefer if a small subset of well-informed individuals make the decisions on our behalf? If we trust the masses to make rational decisions why even bother setting up a government in the first place?  Then we ask - what do we want out of this? And are we aligned on these ideas as a society?  Do we know what we want or do we need to set up some sort of framework to help us decide? And how do we know for sure if what we've chosen is actually good for us?  And how do we determine what is good or bad and how will we know that's the outcome that will happen?   These are the questions of Normative Ethics vs descriptive ethics- philosophical questions that society needs to agree on before you begin to set up a government.   I am exhausted with the crude reductionist view in American politics that  Democrats = large government and Republicans = small government.   The question we should be asking- in all instances of policymaking - is whether society needs to (collectively) intervene in some aspect of life to achieve a more desirable outcome.  If every political discussion began with this question  things would be so much more level headed   We can politely disagree about whether intervention should or should not occur and respective values of costs and benefits thereof  We can politely disagree about the method of intervention, and the severity and scale of that intervention.  We can also politely disagree on what the targeted objectives of the intervention can be.  We can also politely disagree on the manner in which those objectives are measured and reported.  The collective agreement on the above rules is how we determine government, and ultimately set policy for how to run society.  The government is then the collective body in which society makes rules and enforces them on itself, ideally for its own good.   Once the government is set up, what do we want it to do and how much power should it have?  Do we want to take a position on whether government intervention is good or bad?  Should the government be paternal or laissez faire ?  All of these questions have gotten lost in the modern Republican vs Democrat debate. Partisans rely on ""rules of thumb"" to test whether ideas check out with their party. That is too simple minded and It really shouldn't be this way. I've read enough History to appreciate that the freedoms and liberties entitled to Americans are uncommonly rare among societies. An educational foundation in Civics is how we preserve this tradition and pass it on to future generations.   So, Politics is just the game we play -using the rules of government -  to determine how policymaking power moves back and forth across stakeholders.   The plot is lost when the people think that ""Government"" is nothing more than a game that must be won. The Meaningless exchange of power without any focus on problem solving undermines the reason the government was there in the first place.  If we can agree on this basic definition we'd be so much better off.",gadela08,2025-03-08T00:06:39,1
"Government could actually do everything better, cheaper, and more efficiently   the reason it doesn’t is because capitalists and those in the private sector are incentivized to sabotage our cheaper/better options so they can create a market of manufactured scarcity and desperation, this allows them to commodify products and services for profits.  This framing also buys into the myth that the private sector does things better than the government. Which is funny, because these systems create administrative bloat and create inefficiencies as a result of their profit incentives. The service/product gets worse with time - as they rely on less underpaid staff, cheaper materials and instruments, and charge people more for their services. All to squeeze out extra profits for those who only fulfill an administrative position or who are only a passive investor.   Having a public option that works well and is affordable is every corporations nightmare.   You think insurance companies and drug companies want you to have affordable healthcare and drugs? Hell No they don’t. They want you to pay out the nose, to make the process of getting your coverage a long dragged out ordeal.   It’s the same across every industry.

"Government is good at getting the big things done if cost is no object because they can use force. They can go to war or build an interstate highway system because there isn’t anyone to say no, and funding isn’t a primary concern.  As long as the private sector has competition, they are good at improving their services or products.  The dirty little secret is, the private sector HATES competition and will try hard to get rid of it, because it’s easier than doing a better job than the competition. That’s why airlines and supermarkets are always trying to merger. That’s why they have lobbies in Washington and boards that set rates and limit their own numbers.  Unfortunately government has no incentive to be efficient; in fact quite the opposite. If they do better with less funding, they’ll get less funding!

"Fact is the Government does just about everything more effectively and efficiently than the private sector.   Virtually every instance of fraud has involved CONTRACTORS doing what had been done by Government workers.   Medicare/medicaid  fraud is done by Corporate providers scamming the system.   Cost overruns happen only with contracts, the Government is prohibited from exceeding the amounts specified by Congress and the President.   Last I checked, Republicans in Congress passed legislation that a contractor can ""win"" a bid to perform something the Govt is doing ""in-house"" with a bid of 110% of the inhouse costs.   People grouse about the USPS but all the private delivery firms use USPS to make deliveries to ""unprofitable"" addresses, and Republicans have forbidden USPS from engaging in  ""profitable"" endeavors.  The exceptions occur when the bonehead decisions are made by POLITICAL APPOINTEES, and those who ""burrowed"" into the Civil Service when their appointment time expired.

"I do think there's some argument to be said that taxpayer-funded, bureaucratic institutions that face no competition have less of an incentive to innovate than organizations that have fixed budgets determined by how well they've pleased their customers. I'm a filthy leftist, but I think competitive, free markets are actually not bad (note: the objection is not to competing nor to free markets, but to the ownership structure of the participants *in* that competition *in* those free markets).  So, in that regard, industries and economic sectors where there is high payoff to innovation, I think government does not do so well.  Industries that are established and near-monopolistic, with high profit margins due to the inability for consumers to switch providers and very little innovation, though? Those are almost symptoms insisting that a sector is ripe for nationalization. The government likely won't really innovate, but will streamline administration and basically keep the status quo humming along with a minimum of exploitation for the workers and service interruption for the customers. Government does really well there.

"To extrapolate from this with OP's framing, I think the main differences between how conservatives and liberals view the responsibilities of government come in where they draw these lines; where they see government as being the correct arbiter of markets, and where the private market can better handle things.  I agree monopolies are the primary concern, not just due to antitrust manipulation and rent-seeking which destroys the free market, but because of the inherent coercive power that comes from controlling essential services/utilities which would basically allow corporations to demand exorbitant fees under threat of death.  Utilities such as water and heating, and services like healthcare, fire, military, justice and police protection could all easily become protection rackets for mob cartels in the private market because it is nearly impossible to turn a profit in these markets without levying coercive force against the consumer.  Most conservatives agree that at least transportation infrastructure, fire, justice, military and police should be public services, free from the ability to levy coercive force against consumers who use their services, but exclude healthcare. Even then, there are far-right libertarian conservatives who would prefer the type of anarchy which actually destroys the free market and results in feudal forces which turn consumers into serfs.  Meanwhile, most liberals agree than not only should those services/utilities which carry strong potential for coercive force under the public purview, but many other services which also just do not respond well to profit incentives and are considered of wide benefit to humanity, such as education, housing and food for the homeless, and transportation along main routes. And, the far-left may wish to see all markets fall under public control, at the very least under libertarian worker co-op control if not a centralized authoritarian power.  I would love to see a public dialectic based on research-based facts rather than simple ideological claims surrounding this, because it really does appear to be the crux of disagreement between political sides, although attention is often shunted to hot button issues, and it seems as though there should be an underlying consensus available in the data by now.

"Well said. The government can and does excel in a lot of areas.  Where it falls short, IMO, is that our elected officials fail over and over again to represent the will of the people.  Trump is a prime example. Nobody in America voted for Elon Musk to break government agencies that do important work. Nobody in America voted to overturn 100 years of American foreign policy. Nobody in America voted to forget all about the economy and drive prices sky high.  And because of party politics, the checks and balances no longer appear to apply.  The career parts of the government actually work - the USPS (pre DeJoy), the military, the IRS, USAID, NIH, FBI, etc. Err, they *did* work. I don't know about anymore.  **Edit to add** a concrete example of a service that state, local, and federal agencies, as well as the private sector provide, a critical service - wildland fire fighting.  Last year, USFS wildland firefighters were made probationary employees, so as far as I'm aware, they were fired. That leaves state and local, with contractors presumably filling the hole left by the firings.  In my experience, USFS fire crews receive better training, are issued better equipment, and cost the government less. Firing them will increase costs and lead to less effective fire fighting. More homes will burn and more lives will be lost, and it will cost us more.",kinkgirlwriter,2025-03-07T19:38:29,7

"The thing is, people have to vote in a system where half the country votes republican. When describing a system that includes republican voters, the quote is absolutely correct.  What you describe reduces to a [coordination problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game). If everyone suddenly wanted the government to work, that would, in fact work. But that's not unique, if you suddenly had buy-in from the entire populace, you could make most any system work. And further, the option you're implying (the choice between the government working or not working) isn't the option presented to the marginal voter.  The marginal voters are presented with the following:  1. Vote for the party that doesn't want the government to work. The government won't work, but there will be generally less internal taxes and regulation, and there will be less support for culturally left institutions (all of these are highly desirable to decent percentages of the population).  2. Vote for the party that wants the government to work. The government still won't work, but maybe in 50 years, if this party ever gets decent at messaging, the government might start to work. In the meantime, internal taxes and regulation will be generally higher (this is generally undesirable unless the government is *already* working, and it can be put to good use), but culturally left institutions will receive more support (this one is desirable to a certain percentage of the population, but not as many as the three combined above).

Public goods are **products or services that are essential** but are not profitable for private companies to produce, so the government provides them instead.  # 🔹 Key Characteristics of Public Goods  1. **Non-Excludable** – You **can’t stop** people from using them (e.g., clean air, streetlights). 2. **Non-Rivalrous** – One person's use **doesn’t reduce availability** for others (e.g., national defense).  # 🔹 Examples of Public Goods  ✅ **Infrastructure** (roads, bridges, public transit)   ✅ **National Defense** (military, border security)   ✅ **Public Safety** (police, fire departments)   ✅ **Education** (public schools, universities)   ✅ **Public Health** (vaccinations, sanitation)  # 🔹 Why Doesn’t the Private Sector Provide Them?  * **Free Rider Problem** – People benefit **without paying**, so companies can't make a profit. * **High Costs, Low Returns** – Large investments needed but **no direct revenue** (e.g., maintaining roads).  # 🔹 Government Solutions  * **Taxes** – Funded by taxpayers so everyone contributes. * **Subsidies** – Government helps private companies provide services (e.g., postal service, utilities).

"I am lucky in that my stutter rarely makes an appearance and I honestly do not remember how I overcame it other than doing the exercises they gave me. It was a long gradual road because even when things are going well, the fear exists that it is looming and waiting to come back at any minute. I was lucky in that it comes back so randomly and rarely that I think nothing of it now.  I've been put in leadership roles my entire life because I was bigger than everyone and somewhat smart and that accelerated my having to get over it because I was made to speak to/for groups. So I had to simultaneously get over a fear of public speaking and my personal fear of stuttering by just doing the thing. I think sports helped, too, because like singing, it was a form of communication where stuttering never happened.  Career-wise, I ended up in more supervisor and manager roles because of my comfortability with public speaking and decision making. It is rare that a weakness turns into a strength, but the journey of overcoming this challenge shaped my abilities. I worked in utilities so a proper transfer of knowledge at the end of shift was critical, so that was free decades of practice of working on communication.  Effective communication is key for these roles so if you have a handle on that then I wouldn't think about stuttering.

"I think the Nordic countries are more social democracies in terms of governmental policy rather than governmental structure. As a social democracy, they're relatively conservative probably too. To my knowledge there are not a notable amount of democratic workplaces for instance, and there's no UBI/NIT or universal post-secondary education. Still, probably the best examples of social democracy that we have in practice, and a strong demonstration of the benefits they provide over what is basically just nascent oligarchy/feudalism in the US and UK.  Comparative studies in government and economics are definitely the right fields to look at I think. What I'm specifically interested in though is finding ways to push that out into public conversation on those terms. Real, fact-based conversation on government and economic systems between academics seeking a consensus reality, a bedrock for discussion. At the moment, politicians and commentators just tend to make a lot of rhetorical claims. To me, determining these issues should be a lot more like agreeing on the shape of the earth, and whether it it revolves around the sun or the other way around. We should be looking to settle these topics definitively.  At the moment, even when academic fields such as criminology have broad-based consensus on topics such as ending the drug wars and for-profit prisons, and focusing on rehabilitation over punishment, we can't get that consensus to translate into policy because the public is not aware of that consensus, so politicians are terrified of implementing anything that goes against ""common wisdom"". It was literally the same when people thought the earth was flat. Leaders were terrified to affirm a basic scientific fact.   A while ago I watched a conversation between Art Laffer and Richard Wolff, and nearly screamed at the screen. Two of the top academics in economics in complete disagreement on fundamental topics, but they only scrape the surface in 60 minutes, each saying they had data to back up their conclusions which they did not share with each other, and have never followed up on that discussion. We should be locking these people in a room together until they reach a consensus on fundamental data, and then communicating that in lockstep in easily understandable ways to the public. These are not trivial topics we're dealing with, millions of people die every year due to poor economic conditions and governmental structure deficiencies.

While Wolff agreed with their analysis, Laffer was diametrically opposed.  Of course, of the two, Laffer is the one who has sat in the White House dictating policy for decades. So, the fact of their disagreement unresolved in a definitive sense between them is meaningful only academically. One of them has literally shaped the world in his image.
