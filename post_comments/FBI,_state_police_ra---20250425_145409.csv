"I will absolutely acknowledge that Harris was the better choice in this past election and that everyone concerned about the genocide in Palestine should have voted for her over Trump.   However, Harris's handling of the genocide was still very poor. There wasn't a Palestinian speaker at the convention and Harris didn't make even minor gestures or acts of support towards the interests of pro-Palestine groups. She also infamously stated that she wouldn't change a thing from Biden's presidency/policies. She actively campaigned with the Cheneys and took the support of Neocons associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her campaign sent Bill Clinton and Ritchie Torres to Michigan to basically lecture Muslim voters into voting for her.   I think the evidence suggests that Biden is one of the most Zionist/pro-Israel voices in the Democratic Party and has been so for decades. I don't believe that Harris has that level of commitment to the Zionist cause and perhaps was slightly more movable on issues like a permanent ceasefire, banning offensive military aid, and working towards a two-state solution. However, let's be clear that the genocide in Gaza is incredibly morally reprehensible and Harris's handling of it and the people protesting it during her time as VP and then her campaign was been very, very lacking and cannot be dismissed as a source of legitimate anger among much of the Democratic base.",Naviers_stoke,2025-04-25T15:43:34,-26
"Ah yes, the liberals coming out of the woodworks now with their own blue maga groupthink and lack of both empathy and critical thinking.   Not every pro-Palestinian activist or protestor voted for Trump, Stein or sat out.   Believing Kamala deserved the Muslim vote and lost her all of the swing states, not just the ones with heavy Muslim populations, borders on delusion and insanity.   And you will on the one hand be up in arms about the kidnappings and those disappeared to El Salvador, cheering on the white savior over there demanding to see one and aghast that this is possible while simultaneously gleefully exposing some rancid sense of joy at every single person you generalize as responsible for Trump, which can be anyone against genocide and anyone Muslim. Dare I say it is almost racist.   Sure they are starting with pro-Palestinian activists, especially the darker-skinned ones. But Democrats made it acceptable. If only China handed paid these protestors in 2024 right, as Pelosi said. What did the other Democratic leaders say about them, and what resolutions did they support that directly led to the ease with which the current admin has had in painting this group as basically Hamas?  One wonders if in a so-called democracy under Biden that his admin listened to the majority of ALL voters on all sides and declined to support the genocide of the Palestinian people - one wonders if Kamala would have won.   I‚Äôm here for the downvotes. I know they‚Äôre coming. That is fine. I know, Kamala called for a ceasefire! Like a lot!!!!!!

"When did Harris ever say anything about Palestinian suffering during her time as VP and the campaign, though?

I can't recall when she ever even acknowledged the pro-Palestine cause outside of that.  Palestine was certainly not the only issue at play in this campaign, and Trump was definitely worse than Harris in many areas, like tax cuts, abortion, and democracy. However, part of the responsibility of a politician is to assemble a winning coalition by speaking to their interests.
