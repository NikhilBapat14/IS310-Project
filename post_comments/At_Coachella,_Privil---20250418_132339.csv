"This year, admission costs for the festival range from about $600 to $1300, not including airfare, hotels, or on-site food (Which costs about $100 per meal). Nearly 60 percent of attendees financed their tickets with a payment plan. At this price point, it is increasingly clear that Coachella is not about enjoying an artistic experience, but about purchasing a lifestyle. The spring event is a cultural touchstone, where the hottest celebrities are spotted sipping drinks and sharing laughs together. It is a wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing, a playground for the elite. Across the nation, hundreds and thousands of people pay exorbitant amounts of money to feel as though they, too, are part of that exclusive class.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T15:33:08,31
"The act and the show are what the collectivist side of politics orbits around. All coverage for the deported gangster and no coverage for the American hostages, mainstream reddit allocates their cares accordingly.  They expect us to all cry for a stranger who hates us while we're not supposed to talk about our own dying in overseas terrorist captivity. They hold grudges against us because we don't feel things their (assigned) way.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T15:25:02,15
