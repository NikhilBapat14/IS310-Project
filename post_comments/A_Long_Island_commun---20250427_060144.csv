"I wonder if the CNN reporter who filed this story bothered to travel more than a few blocks from MHS to get a feel for the situation. On the south side of Sunrise Highway just west of Hicksville Road and well within Massapequa is a medium size office building named Big Chief Lewis Building. Along side the building is a two story stereotypical Native American statue with a full headdress. As the story stated, Trump was favored in the area which is sometimes derisively called MAGApequa. Since the campaign there have been several convoys of MAGA flag waving pickups up and down Sunrise. While there’s suddenly much talk of the image being intended to honor the tribe, there is no mention of the 1644 massacre that removed them from the area so that Dutch settlers could take the land. It is revisionist history that Takapausha sold the land. The true history is that the Dutch purchased hunting privileges then sent John Underhill, a British mercenary to massacre the tribe.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T09:07:26,6
