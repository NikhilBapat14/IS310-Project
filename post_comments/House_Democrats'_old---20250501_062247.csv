">But, Lynch argued, ""there is a job to be done ‚Äî and as an attorney, this is an investigations committee, and so it's serious business. It's not going to be run in the press.""  Yeah man, we'd all like Congress to be serious folks who know the law but you do realize the current chair of the oversight committee is *James Comer* right? He's an absolute buffoon who has now led the committee for literally years with a primary focus on spicy announcements to the media about Hunter Biden's penis. Not careful investigations, not a thorough understanding of the law, but grandstanding on social media has been the purpose of this ""investigations committee"" for a while now.  So, like, I recognize you would like Congress to return to serious business but you actually need to be the majority or that shit isn't happening.  Is it really dumb that the ranking member of the oversight committee needs to be someone who can drop a spicy sound bite and tweet a lot? Yes it's dumb. It's also true.",thrawtes,2025-05-01T06:29:06,27

Old guard would rather have fascists in power than budge even an inch to the left like the rising stars in the party are asking. As an outside observer it's crazy to me your country really is right wing and super right wing,AdmiralRon,2025-05-01T10:20:43,3

"Its such a fundamental misunderstanding of modern politics writ large. When you're in the minority, you're not going to get to conduct investigations. It's about drawing eyeballs to malfeasance and shifting narratives.  It makes me think of a Marlo quote from The Wire.  ""You want it to be one way...but it's the other way.""",Pike_Gordon,2025-05-01T06:48:43,14
Yeah that blew my mind. What a completely baseless statement. Turning up dirt for the press to focus on is 100% of the job.  I can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôs really so stupid as to believe what he‚Äôs saying; he must just be dishonest and committed to the party remaining nothing more than a vehicle for his own personal benefit.,teluetetime,2025-05-01T07:49:37,9
You are correct. They would be more effective if they treated republicans the same way they treat progressives.,InterestingTry5190,2025-05-01T12:12:57,2

"Because they‚Äôve been so entrenched in being a (D) for so long that they‚Äôre terrified of becoming irrelevant due to their old age and inability to adapt to the times. They think they‚Äôre owed things because they‚Äôve been in office so long and played the game.

Well when his wife has inside information that results in her sticks beating the markets by a statistically improbable margin that will get into people heads.  Not to mention she oversaw the Biden to Harris transition that allowed Harris to avoid the primary and give voters a say.  So yeah I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs time for the old guard and insiders stock trading to go.,funguy07,2025-05-01T09:23:48,7
Most are well past retirement age and financially set.  I just don‚Äôt get why you would even want to continue when you don‚Äôt have any power anyway.  Go live what‚Äôs left of your life.,Somnambulinguist,2025-05-01T10:32:56,4
