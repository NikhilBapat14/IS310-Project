"Our ""strong foreign policy"" is merely a continuation of the Nehruvian policy of non-alignment. It's obviously more expansive as we have more resources, but it is interesting that we are currently unable to condemn Russian aggression or the Israeli genocide. Meanwhile, India did condemn both Western imperialism and Soviet aggression in Hungary. We were also involved in the process to establish peace in Korea, the Congo, and Egypt.

"I appreciate your civility and the fact that you actually provided a lot of evidence for everything you claimed, thanks for that! Now let’s address some of these arguments, the pm failing to acknowledge Chinese intrusion was a simple misunderstanding, one that was quickly clarified by the government. As for condemning Russia, we have condemned violence and the deaths of thousands, but we do not condemn Russia because there is a lot of historical significance and context that must be looked into. Historically Russia has been an ally on India, where it was actually the west in the 1971 war that not only showed aggression but went to the extent of sending extensive naval fleets in an attempt to aid Pakistan in the war. Russia has always supported India historically and has been a major trading partner. You mention soviet aggression in Hungary, and I assume you mean in 1956, however in 1956 Indian-Russian ties were not nearly as developed as they are now. Let me give you an example, when The USA invaded Iraq and killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis over a false claim, and not only did the UK not condemn the US for it, they actually joined in. Now for the democracy articles you attached, these are interesting sources no doubt, though doesn’t the 2024 election where the INDIA alliance actually made huge gains act as direct evidence against the claim that India is turning into a dictatorship? As for the widening socio economic gap, that’s true it is a big problem, but we’re living in an era where global wars and recessions have caused a major economic crisis around the world, not just India. We were also hit pretty hard during Covid, a crisis which was undoubtedly handled very very well by the government.",RhubarbBeginning5638,2025-04-24T15:10:28,1
"I can only express my own gratitude to you for your generous and kind response which is not without substance. I appreciate your willingness to have a more nuanced perspective rather than a black-and-white one.  With regard to China, I would say that it is quite clear that the PM has been reticent. The claim that nobody has entered our territory was intentionally vague because very clearly, PPs that were under our control had been taken away. The whole of Aksai Chin is claimed by India, so this kind of ambiguous language makes it apparent that there was a hesitation. This reveals the truth futher:  https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/india-has-lost-access-to-26-of-65-patrolling-points-in-ladakh-says-research-paper/  I know that Russia is a close ally. The Soviet Union was also helping India in the 1950s (remember that we were in a much more desperate situation back then), but we still criticised what they did after initially waiting for the full facts to appear. Here, years have passed and we have equivocal statements like we want peace or this is not the era for war. This means nothing. Mr Putin has also been saying he wants peace. But obviously, his idea of peace involves Ukraine just surrendering their territory to them in a way that violates every aspect of international law. What the United Kingdom did back then was wrong, and most people today recognise it as such.   It is true that every country has faced trouble recently, but all of them haven't seen as big of a gulf between the haves and the have nots as India has.   As far as COVID-19 is concerned, I am actually not one of those people who think that the government did an entirely bad job. Early on, given our large population, they did a relatively decent job (though restrictions and sanitation could have been emphasised earlier and I don't know why we needed the PM's picture on every vaccination certificate). Where the government seriously stumbled was when they basically decided to relax restrictions too quickly. I still vividly remember how people had stopped wearing masks and checking also weakened. And then, as feared, a second, more damaging wave came:  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56771766  Lastly, the election results went this way mainly because so many people were constantly drawing attention to the democratic crisis in India. All eyes were on the election process, and leaders of all parties had told their workers to pay especial attention to the whole process and stay at the booths for as long as possible. This prevented the worst-case scenario, but sometimes, we can all take a few steps back if we are confident that we will be able to take a lot more steps forward in a subtle manner. I would also recommend watching Mr Thapar's interview with Mr Deshpande on the topic of the EVMs. To the best of my knowledge, the issues highlighted by him haven't been resolved yet, even though it wouldn't take much to do so. I could also mention things like NDTV's takeover or the blatant violation of the MCC via the way in which the PM's so-called meditation was broadcast right before voting, but I don't want to drag this on for too long.  Overall, I think that we can both agree that we need a good opposition without wasting much time. The cost may prove a bit too heavy.  Anyway, thank you, once again, for your positive engagement.  May you and your loved ones stay safe and happy!",Stock-Mushroom-8503,2025-04-24T15:29:54,1
"Yea few interesting points here again, and to be very honest, I actually agree with a good amount of the stuff you’re saying, and I agree that the Modi government isn’t an ideal government, and yes effective opposition is always key in a functioning democracy, something which has been slowly fading away in India in the last 5-10 years. Perhaps we would agree that the best choice among the parties is still BJP, but again they’re not perfect and there are definitely some flaws. Communal politics and violence has definitely worsened and I’m not gonna be naive and say that this government isn’t pro Hindu, it most certainly is. As for china, yes it is true the PM did use vague language, but correct me if I’m wrong - wasn’t that openly addressed by the government later if not by the PM himself?   As for the russia point, I agree India can definitely be a bit more open to condemning Russia, but I don’t think we should stop trading with or support the sanctions on Russia, because buying Russian oil is very very beneficial for India, and at the end of the day, we have to be India first.  As for the widening socio economic gap, I have to admit I do have a bit of bias in the matter because I come from a family which is probably in the top 1% you refer to in the widening gap. I agree, that is a problem that should be addressed, but I wouldn’t necessarily blame that entirely on the government. In such a populous country, especially one where a majority of the country is rural or is mainly a tier 2/3 city, especially given that we are a democracy, it is very difficult to make economic progress that benefits all. Remember the reforms on farmers the government tried to pass - which were inherently good for the economy, were protested so heavily by most farmers that the government was eventually forced to give in.   Election results wise, yea I mean I agree there was a lot of attention on the polling this time, but I find it extremely hypocritical to claim that elections may be fraudulent or rigged , especially when congress leaders make such claims when BJP victories are seen, while when congress has good results, such claims are immediately dropped. Of course  political leaders lie all the time so that would explain many of those claims. I will make sure to check out that interview, thanks a lot for the recommendation!  Yea to conclude I guess we do agree mainly that the government does have its flaws, though I suppose we could agree to disagree on the overall performance of the government. That’s totally fine because that’s how democracy works. I do agree though that a strong opposition is key in ensuring we don’t go from a democracy to a dictatorship.  Thanks a lot for this discussion! It’s very rare to find people like yourself who are civil and make strong arguements supported by evidence who engage in constructive conversation rather than just violent and disrespectful arguments, which I unfortunately seem to find all the time on Reddit.  I hope you and your family are doing well and safe, and wish them and yourself all the best and safety in the future!",RhubarbBeginning5638,2025-04-24T15:54:42,1
"I don't think that the PM, at any point, said that China had entered our territory when the dispute was ongoing.  Yes, we may continue the trade, but we should also set boundaries:  https://www.worldecr.com/news/india-becomes-second-largest-supplier-of-restricted-tech-to-russia/  I am also from a fairly well-off family, my friend. But this is also why I recognise how little so many of my fellow countrymen have. Actions like relaxing border security rules for one company don't bode well for our future. Yes, we do have a variety of challenges, and hopefully we can resolve them via dialogue and consultations. If the government had created a more robust framework of welfare instead of distributing freebies, not strengthened crony capitalism, and actually come up with a cohesive strategy to move people away from agriculture, it may have generated a more positive response. Trust is also a matter of character. This article was useful to me when I was reading about this topic:  https://www.deccanherald.com/india/dh-deciphers-what-was-wrong-with-the-farm-laws-why-wont-farmers-end-the-protest-1052974.html  Meghnerd once talked about the Enigma machine.
