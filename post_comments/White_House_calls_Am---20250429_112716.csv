Aren't taxes displayed on receipts as a matter of law?  They certainly all list sales or excise taxes.  I think congress should act to make sure any import taxes are also listed.,FalstaffsMind,2025-04-29T11:31:29,10
the truth is very hostile to them. do people beleive them when they say Bidens Inflation like it was something the government did ?,JaVelin-X-,2025-04-29T11:31:48,5
Immediately after this Amazon came out and denied it ever planned to do this. Which isn't hard to believe when you remember Bezos dropped his pants for Trump.   I wish merchants like Amazon had the balls to display to Amerikkkans the consequences of their actions.,Rich-Leg510,2025-04-29T11:32:32,4

I am under no illusion about who is paying the import taxes.  And excise taxes do include some import fees.,FalstaffsMind,2025-04-29T11:38:51,1
Yes but tariffs aren't excise taxes and neither of these have to be reported to the consumer.,Rich-Leg510,2025-04-29T11:47:34,2
Why would anyone be against informing the public of how much of the cost of buying an item is a brand new tax paid to the Federal Government?,FalstaffsMind,2025-04-29T12:54:35,2
Not exactly sure what's being asked here but if you're basically asking why companies don't go completely transparent and tell consumers the costs for everything and the profits they make on each product...   Well I have a very complicated easy answer for you. Capitalism. We could go into all the specifics but long story short owners pay to put politicians they want into elections to keep the market privatized.,Rich-Leg510,2025-04-29T14:20:19,1
Tariffs aren't capitalism.  Most certainly not laissez-faire capitalism.  It's just massive taxation.  It promises to be the largest tax increase in US history.,FalstaffsMind,2025-04-29T15:00:40,1

"What you said was ""Well I have a very complicated easy answer for you. Capitalism.""  You dismissed import taxes as the cost of doing business in a Capitalist economy.  As if a 245% tariff on Chinese goods is just like building a new breakroom for the employees or sourcing stainless steel screws.  It's simply a cost of doing business.  And informing the consumer of why they are paying a 245% tariff surcharge on Christmas Lights is objectionable.  I find that ludicrous.",FalstaffsMind,2025-04-30T08:08:51,1
"""You dismissed import taxes as the cost of doing business in a Capitalist economy."" *Because that's what tariffs are...*   ""And informing the consumer of why they are paying a 245% tariff surcharge on Christmas Lights is objectionable."" *I'm sorry you don't like how our system works but that's how it is right now. Businesses intentionally don't tell you the cost of everything including the price hikes from tariffs.*   Why do you think businesses aren't telling people what it costs to make, import, sell and ship?     Edit: Here's a better question... why doesn't the US have a state run grocery store or car dealer or computer manufacturer or literally anything that Americans consume on a daily basis?",Rich-Leg510,2025-04-30T09:50:16,1
"why doesn't the US have a state run grocery store...  For the same reason tariffs are so damaging... Because competition is the best mechanism for keeping prices low.  And when you use tariffs to suppress global competition, then you are essentially doing exactly what the Soviets did in the 1950s: creating a centrally controlled artificial closed economy.  The only valid use of tariffs is when a foreign supplier is trying to undercut a domestic producer by dumping goods at below cost in an effort to force the domestic producer into a price war or bankruptcy.  The fact is consumers benefit from Free Trade: the efficient use of comparative advantage, global competition and efficient world wide supply chains.    There is this quixotic desire use tariffs to 'bring back manufacturing'.  Which seems to be fueled by this idea that it will translate into jobs.  There are several flaws in this line of reasoning.  1. If your tariff regime results in reciprocal tariffs (duh), then there is no international market for the goods you produce.  Like the Soviets you become an isolated economy.  Already our relationship with Canada (the largest market for US exports) is damaged beyond repair.  There goes nearly half a trillion dollars in exports. 2. Building a factory takes years and costs billions.  And it will will rely entirely on investors being dead sure the tariffs are going to be in place for decades **and** that the goods don't simply route around the tariffs (Apple is moving production to India for the US market). 3. Automation and AI have combined to create so-called Dark Factories.  There are factories being opened in Japan and China that will operate 24x7x365 without a single human line worker.    The only jobs will be highly trained engineers who maintain the manufacturing equipment.  (In other words H1B Visa Jobs)",FalstaffsMind,2025-04-30T10:37:29,1
"""Because competition is the best mechanism for keeping prices low."" We live in a Capitalist society. Was this happening before Trump's tariffs? No. So obviously this response is wrong.    The government RIGHT NOW could decommodify food, health, and housing all while bringing down prices to rock bottom with the wealth that it has. However the American populace... like you... are blinded by propaganda fed to you by the owners of this country.   You speak like a libertarian and frankly I've heard too many debates about this very topic from people with that view. You need to reevaluate your positions.    You want a deep dive into the positions I align with? Here's this: https://youtu.be/HsPeEF7x_UQ?si=n6BkD3h_DyyfPGKe   This is a debate between someone that shares a lot of my views and a libertarian candidate.",Rich-Leg510,2025-04-30T11:12:08,1
"Frankly I work in Government and have most of my adult life.  Libertarians to me have a very limited view and seem to think that anarchy would result in paradise.  I consider myself a political pragmatist and an anti-populist. Populism tries to turn oversimplification into a virtue.    Government's strength and its primary role lies in meeting the true needs of the people that the market either ignores, inadequately serves, or due to economics of scale, serves inefficiently.    With respect to health in particular, I agree with you.  The United States has a terrible healthcare system.  Profits are valued more than human life, not paying claims is incentivized, and the insurance market is hopelessly fragmented.  The pragmatist in me looks at Single Payer systems working elsewhere in the world. I have talked to rather wealthy health insurance sales people who will readily admit that they are part of the problem.  I will watch that video you posted later.",FalstaffsMind,2025-04-30T14:28:12,1
