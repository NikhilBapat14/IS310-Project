"One reason is enthusiasm draws turnout and donations. US campaigns rely heavily on donations to function, and nobody wants to donate to the candidate who says they will lose. People will donate to a winner who draws in enthusiasm and support.",ProLifePanda,2024-09-10T09:34:21,2
"I think part of it's not so much ""confidence"" as it is ""strength,"" and it is a function of our presidential system that we are far more focused on the personality of our candidates than you all are. Both campaigns right now are trying to cast themselves as ascendant underdogs, not ""have it in the bag"" winners.  I understand that in the UK, if you ask someone, ""How did you vote?"" They will answer ""I voted labor"" much sooner than they will answer ""I voted for Keir Starmer"" or ""I voted for such and such MP."" If you ask an American, they will most likely say ""I voted for Donald Trump"" before they will say ""I voted Republican.: Our campaigns are personally driven in a way UK campaigns are not. Americans want ""strong"" presidential candidates, and I think ""confidence"" is a proxy for strong. I assume strength is not as important in the UK, but I do remember that Ed Milliband was widely discredited as ""weak"" and a ""nerd""  Also, the major danger of ""overconfidence"" in the UK, is that people will have ""permission"" to vote for a smaller party, the danger there not being so much that this will cause you to lose, but that you will not win a majority, or your majority will be narrow.  Here in the US, right now no matter who wins the presidency or congress, we know there will be a slim majority in both houses and campaigns. Harris is actively campaigning for the votes of Republicans who will vote for her, and then vote for a Republican in Congress.",loselyconscious,2024-09-10T23:48:30,1
