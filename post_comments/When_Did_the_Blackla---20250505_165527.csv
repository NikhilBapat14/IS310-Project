I don’t think the vast majority were against the war until the insurgency really got going and it started to feel like another Vietnam. Before that it was really only leftists who were opposed and the administration was still using 9/11 to accuse their opponents of being unpatriotic.,BaldingMonk,2025-05-05T18:52:50,65
It didn't really become unpopular until the insurgency really got going in summer 2003. There were some shocking images of US contractors being burned and also the abu Girab torture scandal. And still no WMDs found by the summer and people started to question it more.   Anti war Democrats like Howard Dean started getting lots of support in the Democratic presidential primary late 2003.  Even then Bush was still popular and the country was really divided. Overall opinion on Bush didn't really go down until he botched the Hurricane Katrina response in 2005.  That really finally opened the door for Obama who rode his anti war politics to defeating Hillary in the 2007-8 Dem primary. And he delivered by pulling most of our troops out (though Bush had already negotiated an exit by then).,blyzo,2025-05-05T18:58:23,30
"Bush went from having a very polarized electorate to a position of mass unity after the 9/11 attack.  There was broad support within the US and from our allies to go after Bin Laden, suspected of being in Afghanistan.  But there wasn't public support for attacking Iraq.  To anyone following closely, it was clear that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attack.  But the Bush admin kept working on the WPD (weapons of mass destruction) argument, steadily building up support over the course of a year of disinformation to sell Americans and allies of the immediate threat that was Iraq.    Bush barely made it through the election of '04 before public turned sour. Evidence had been mounting for a long period of time that the WPD angle was falling apart, but he made it through the election before public opinion started turning sharply against him.    If you want to learn more about it, Fiasco, by Thomas Ricks gives a detailed but engaging account of the period.

"Among Dems in power, probably 2004 or so. The whole W presidency kind of took them off guard and didn't know how to say boo to a popular president after the country really, really wanted someone to pay for 9/11. By 2004, that halo effect was gone, and it was clear to all but the dumbest Republicans that there was no plan to get us out of there  Not to mention John Kerry was getting swiftboated and even the most ""support our troops"" democrats were like fuck this guy",OrwellWhatever,2025-05-05T18:54:34,9
"> I know by at least early 2004, the Democrats were running strong anti-Iraq campaigns and it became the big debate during the 04 election.  This was about the time the tide turned from just the left and more left-leaning democrats outspokenly opposing the war to mainstream democrats joining in opposition. April of 2004 is when the Abu Garib prison abuse scandal broke and shortly afterwards the first of the torture memos were leaked. I kind of think that’s why more dem primary voters preferred John Kerry; as a veteran himself he was better positioned to criticize the war (after he supported it unfortunately).  I’m not sure you can point to a point where conservative opinions shifted because most republicans would never admit the Invasion was a mistake and based on lies. At least until Trump made it okay to say so.",stevenmoreso,2025-05-05T18:54:38,10
"I think we can conclusively say that the Iraq War was, if not popular, at least not a political career ender as of November 2004.  As of 2006 though, Democrats rode a wave of anti-war sentiment to taking both the house and the Senate.  So somewhere in there.  I don't think there was a specific event.  There was just the slowly dawning realization that we had fucked up.  The justification for the war didn't pan out, we had destabilized the entire region, pissed off the entire world in the process, but worst of all (in voter's eyes), we had no exit strategy.  We were apparently stuck there.  We had to keep throwing American troops and money into a grinder in order for Iraq to not immediately disintegrate. (That was honestly more true of Afghanistan than Iraq, but at least we had a solid reason to start the Afghanistan war.)  It was another Vietnam.

"Maybe this is a regional thing, I grew up in a very conservative state and am just a few years older than you, but was interested in politics from a young age. I would not say immediately like many other commenters have (of course it’s a matter of perspective and there was surely some opposition even in the beginning), but I would say the Abu Graihb scandal in 2003 was a big turning point. The pictures were shocking and disturbing and I remember seeing it on the cover of people magazine or something, and buying it. I bought magazines all the time when I’d go with my mom to the grocery store at that age. We didn’t have the news on our phones (also didn’t have a phone) so magazines were much more relevant, and I was big on them. It was a massive scandal. From there I think people just saw the war go on and on and on with no end in sight, and seeing young people get thrust into this pointless war that traumatized them and killed Iraqi civilians. There was also the backwater scandal, where Erik Prince’s private military contractors killed a bunch of civilians (google Nisour Square massacre).   So it didn’t happen overnight IMO. In 2005 bush also pissed off a lot of people with the response to hurricane katrina so he lost some credibility with the public after that.   A super fucking cool aside here- Donald Trump pardoned the 4 men convicted in the massacre in 2020 and Erik Prince is still tight with our dictot in chief. He’s actually recently been pitching some plan for his company to get a fat contract on imprisoning immigrants. He’s pure evil.",jst4wrk7617,2025-05-05T20:44:17,4
This also confuses me as someone even younger than you. My first election I could vote in was 2016 and all I’ve ever known of the Republican party is “Trump people”  George Bush’s approval rating dropped into the TWENTYS?? How is that possible with the Republican base who get cognitive dissonance and become more loyal to politicians the more mistakes they make? Why did George Bush not enjoy that privilege? They totally turned on him. Why?? They turned on him before the huge recession. Did they just realize that the war in Iraq was bad? How? Surely they didn’t care about the civilians being killed.,Y0___0Y,2025-05-05T19:31:07,7

It's circa 2006.  And I say that as someone who was protesting in the lead up to the war.  Lots of people were critical even then but it was a *deeply* unpopular position at the time.

I think you need to reframe the question.  There was backlash from the beginning.    When did the majority of people start to think it was a mistake?  I'm sure there's polling out there but I don't have time to look it up.  However I would guess that the tide didn't turn until around 2010.

"Setting the stage:   Back then, I was a 'Reagan Conservative', 30 years old and had just moved to Portland, OR.  I still believed what my government told me and I was in a bit of culture shock with very liberal Portland.   After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the U.S. initiated Desert Storm.  Basically, we kicked Iraq out of Kuwait and decimated most of their military, but stopped short of regime change. We imposed sanctions on Iraq for a decade.  We had imposed 'no-fly' zones for their military.  We questioned their development of nuclear material.  In 1998, President Bill Clinton bombed a few facilities after Iraq rejected some inspections by international inspectors.  Then Senator Hillary Clinton was among many democrats urging Bill Clinton to go to war with Iraq.  So, when Bush was advocating for a new war with Iraq in 2003, there were immediate protests from the (grassroots) left.  Note that several key (leadership) democrats still supported a war.  I assumed the grassroots opposition was based on the fact a Republican was in the white house (politics over policy).  Essentially, the grassroots left (and many libertarians) opposed the war from the onset.  However, general public support was high until the war dragged on for months.  As the evidence mounted that there were no stockpiles of nuclear material, support faded quickly.  As reported by others, support dropped significantly towards the end of his term.       This war, combined with Bush's growth of government spending, turned me from a lifelong republican to a staunch anti-war libertarian.",ipas_and_apis,2025-05-08T05:28:06,2

"Smart people were well aware of the game that the W. Bush team were trying to pull off. The 9-11 attack was conducted and financed by Saudi citizens. Cheney and his little buddy W were very eager and diligent to confuse the American public of this basic fact. They worked to put all the focus on the fact that the terrorists had lived and trained in Afghanistan. The morons running US media rarely mentioned the Saudi ties. (Were they scared of Saudi money being used against them?) So Afghanistan, one of the poorest, least developed countries in the world was turned into a convenient boogie man to start the war the Bush team really wanted. A war to reshape the region to the liking of  Christian conservatives and the Israeli right. If you are interested in the pre 9-11 Republican mind set read up on P-NAC, ( Project for a New American Century).  Dick Cheney , his associates and right wing Israeli's had developed a plan to reshape this region. Step 1 was to eliminate Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a potential threat. He was a vicious dictator, sitting on a large oil reserve and used it  to field a large army. Saddam had nothing to do with 9-11or fundamentalist Islam. But that didn't matter to the Bush team. they decided to use the crisis to start the War they wanted. Once Saddam was gone and the Iraqi military vanquished it was time for step 2. Cutting Iran down to size. And what were the facts on the ground when Saddam was captured? Iran was surrounded on 3 sides by the US military. Just the way P-NAC wanted it . But at this point in time a couple huge screw ups by the Bush team had come to a head. They had no real plan and made several big mistakes in the occupation of Iraq. At the same time a crisis had developed in our financial markets that threatened our entire economy. A crisis clearly rooted in the Bush/Republican de-regulation ethos of the era. Our Federal reserve was literally pouring money into the Wall street banks to keep our economy out of a depression. This financial crisis erupted in 2008 right before the Fall elections. W. Bush and many other Republicans were poling in the 20's right before the election. I believe this explains the victory of Obama .",SparksFly55,2025-05-05T23:02:01,4

"I don't think it was cowardice, I think it was a false belief in Republican competence, which, ironically, by the 2008 primaries Clinton seemed to have learned from and Obama didn't. Hence we had Obama playing-up bipartisanship and negotiation in the primaries when Clinton was much more party-line, a mistake that followed into Obama's presidency.  Before the time of the invasion on March 20 2003, the Iraq War was clearly being sold on a lie. But the vote for authorisation happened nearly six months earlier in September 2002. The refusal of Saddam to allow UN inspections in _was_ suspicious, Security Council Resolution 1441 was passed in November 2002 and it wasn't just passed by the US but by France, Russia and China, and it too had ultimatum language - ""final opportunity to comply"", etc. It's just that Saddam took that final opportunity, the UN went in and found nothing. In a sense, all the threats worked and Bush should have claimed victory then and stopped.  I think we drop the context a lot. In 1996, the US under Bill Clinton passed [sanctions on Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_Libya_Sanctions_Act) to stop its nuclear program, and they worked. Libya gave up its program. US threats against dictatorships to get them to stop weapons programs worked in the 90s.  I also think we tend to retrospectively think that the whole idea that Iraq could have been making WMDs was obviously a lie. I admit that my thinking on this has been changed somewhat by the IAEA finding that [Operation Orchard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Orchard#IAEA_investigation) definitely did hit an under construction Syrian nuclear reactor, built with North Korean aid. Also, that in 2004, [AQ Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan#Proliferation_controversy) admitted to essentially trading Pakistani nuclear technology to Libya and North Korea on TV, and had tried to trade them with Iraq, actions that subsequently have been tied to Pakistan's President at the time.  The North Koreans' first bomb in 2006, their willingness to help other countries build bombs. It's not that the premise of Iraq building weapons was impossible. It's that occupying instead of strategic strikes is obviously stupid, and the intelligence was clear in the months before the invasion that Iraq had given up on its program.  But fundamentally, I agree with you that the Bush Administration was indifferent to evidence and good policy and that was obvious, and that should have made any proposal from them dead on arrival because you couldn't trust them to do anything correctly. It's just that no US politician acts like this, they keep ""acting like statesmen"", giving the benefit of the doubt to Republicans that have done nothing to deserve it. Obama did the same thing when he was actually in Congress or was President. This has been true of the Republican party since Bush, all Trump's nominations should receive zero votes from Democratic Senators because they are all manifestly unfit, etc. I just think, in context, Clinton wasn't exceptional.",just_helping,2025-05-06T01:59:29,7

"I don’t want to dismiss all protests, but damn is it hard to not be jaded after watching so many protest movements in the US amount to basically nothing. Even something as huge as BLM in its 2020 peak didn’t seem to bring any lasting change, if anything it’s the backlash to it that has been more impactful.",subreddette,2025-05-06T16:30:21,1

"You don't have to fear something to repress them.  A school bully doesn't repress you because they fear your power.  They repress because they feel you DON'T have the power to stop them.     Trump is driven by the same drive that creates salespeople; a push to convince their market of what they are selling.  Trump has picked his market and is selling what they want:  a feeling of change,  of finally getting control of the Powers That Be.  He's the Boy who Lived. The Dragon Reborn.  The One.  And he's Winning!    He represses because his market loves it.  He tariffs because his audience cheers.  He renamed the Gulf because it makes the enemy go ""Arg! I'll get you next time,  Trump.  NEXT TIME! ""   people who wonder why he gets elected after a conviction also wonder why he's known for being a success after so many bankruptcies. Which means they have not studied Marketing.     It's not fear. It's just another Deal.      (Bonus points to every reference you got.  Except the last. If you heard a cat meow after that one it just means your as old as me.  Sorry) ",According_Ad540,2025-05-05T23:23:38,6

"Yeah, for sure, but BLM didn't have any economic component to it, and there wasn't national leadership to drive a clear, simple, and consistent goal. The folks who created the national organization for it turned out to basically be grifters. The people at the top knowns what an effective rights moment looks like, and they've put a lot of time and effort into making effective protests more difficult.",JoeSavinaBotero,2025-05-06T16:57:59,2
