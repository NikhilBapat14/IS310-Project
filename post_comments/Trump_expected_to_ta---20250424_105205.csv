More stuff straight from the authoritarian playbook. An attack on the most centralized means of funding progressive causes and candidates is a major step in their goal of squashing opposition before it even happens.,ahdidi413,2025-04-24T11:04:24,58

"Gaslighting, folks.  Every time he loses, or has to back down, or wants cover for overreach testing, he pulls one of these dingers out of his desk.  Pretty common now-a-days, huh!  He'll lose.  Don't be fooled.  Meanwhile he is trying to trigger ""us"" to next-level antics, so he can broaden the gaslighting cloud.  Don't be fooled.  All he's doing is increasing the number of people who want him OUT.  NOW.  But we need to handle him and his antics first.  The key is to let Energizer-Crappit keep whirling around in circles.  Let Dinkleberry Diaper Baby wear himself out.  If we deal w him like the bratty baby he is, we'll make quick work of it.  If we keep reacting to his bait, he can get traction.

"ActBlue is a horror anyway. I get hundreds of unsolicited texts and emails from candidates (whom I’ve never heard of from across the country), every week simply because I donated to a few candidates prior to he 2024 election. I’ve tried everything that ActBlue instructs to prevent more texts and emails but nothing works. Once the genie is out of the bottle you can’t stop the junk mail from candidates using ActBlue’s fundraising platform. I will never donate on ActBlue again. Democrats better get their entire house in order or we’ll never win elections.  Wake up democrats.",PiccoloWilliams,2025-04-25T18:25:39,0
"Didn't ActBlue steal a bunch of money from elderly Democrats? Isn't Act Blue underfire for receiving billions in funding from foreign nationals? Isn't this the same ActBlue that had several key members resign after allegations that they were using money obtained from foreign entities and fraud to fund riots that favored a liberal bias? These are but a few allegations which have been launched at ActBlue in recent months, wouldn't you want an investigation of such things? Remember it is a felony for political campaigns to accept foreign donations or commit fraud to receive income.  People hate this administration so much, they'd condemn Trump before they'd condemn Hitler. I'm not a fan of pompous political leaders, but if they're doing things that might reveal fraud in our Government I'm for it.",Wailing_Owl,2025-04-26T01:42:06,0
"This is horrifying from the perspective of coming after the opposition party’s fundraising.  HOWEVER, ActBlue is a massive, fraudulent, mismanaged scam. It exists purely to sell your contact information. ActBlue refuses to delete your information when contacted (or claims that it has) and happily continues to sell your information. I wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot poll if I was a dem politician. I would very happily see ActBlue dismantled in such a way that somehow deletes myself and everyone else’s info.  Edit: apparently people don’t like reading truth that challenges something they assume to be above board! By all means go read any of the recent articles about it.",finallytisdone,2025-04-24T11:30:54,-20
Not even close. ActBlue is literally a scam that was already imploding. Biden should have shut it down.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T11:34:26,-57
Yea that was my first thought. Will they investigate where his anonymous money for his and Melania's coin comes from? Of course not.  Trumps retribution tour continues.,Mylaptopisburningme,2025-04-24T11:01:06,9

I don't like ActBlue because I'd prefer that if I feel the need to donate to a candidate i do so directly to THAT candidate.   But to call them a scam is some kind of unfounded crap lol,Spam_Hand,2025-04-24T12:38:49,13
I wrote straight up fact.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T12:00:02,-14
They have imploded due to mismanagement. Most of their key staff has left as a result. They publicly state that they take 3.5% of donations as a service fee. I would be shocked if the true figure is not higher. The entire point of the platform is to sell your contact information. They’re one of the most egregious and notorious sellers of your contact information. There is zero you can do to get them to stop selling your information.  Ergo it’s a big fucking scam parading as a “pillar of the democratic party’s digital ecosystem.” It’s honestly a perfect example of how the party leadership and operations has gotten completely detached from the voter base and quite frankly corrupt.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T13:08:21,-18

3.5%? That's the exact credit card processing fee the biggest card networks charge. That's not surprising at all.,Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-24T14:38:06,11
Jesus. Every reddit comment needs a source now?  Have you used ActBlue? I’m hardly the first person to be victimized by it and state online that I’ll never use it again. It completely turned me off from the idea of donating to a political campaign.  NYT article:  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/actblue-democrat-fundraising-resignations.html  Blog post that acts like its debunking these claim when in reality it just describe the hellish nightmare that is ActBlue:  https://matthodges.com/posts/2024-08-25-actblue-isnt-selling-your-data/  And then you’re welcome to look into the House investigation yourself.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T16:44:49,-8
"> literally a scam  Provides zero evidence of a scam.  Doesn't even bother to explain what the scam is.  Posts two links, one of which describes inner turmoil (*not* a scam) and a blog post explaining that campaigns - not Act Blue - send spammy messages.  Invites us to ""look into"" one of about a thousand witch hunt investigations into prominent Democrats that Congressional Republicans open *every*. *single*. *session*. that go nowhere, result in no charges, but drive headlines and the GOP outrage machine.
