"Actually the problem is the only real ""visionaries"" in the Democratic Party are communists, gender/race radicals, and people who want to deconstruct western civilization. No moderate liberals who believe in national sovereignty, sound fiscal policy, and social norms.   Its worse than what Bernie alleges.",milton1775,2025-04-27T15:06:31,38
"Their vision is ""***Trump is Hitler!***""  ...and ""***America is racist and misogynistic!***""  That is the extent of their secular religion right now.",ScorpionDog321,2025-04-27T18:50:23,9

"Despite all the crap we fling about numerous houses and getting kicked out of communes, we need to find someone as authentic and with as much character as Bernie Sanders... except right wing.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-27T14:33:32,16
Of course they lack a vision for the future because they're a death cult. There's no earthly future after you're dead.,triggernaut,2025-04-27T16:56:40,8

That's exactly what's wrong with the party.  Instead of focusing on blue collar workers & Healthcare it's blue haired people and bathrooms.,bobaf,2025-04-27T17:26:48,9
"The visionaries of the democrat party want to dismantle the family unit, let in millions of poor immigrants to vote for them for benefits, and sign over our country's people to globalists, support terrorists, and take all of our income in taxes to pay for the benefits of the people replacing us. Then they wonder why they lose elections and thinks it's just their ""marketing"".",impulsikk,2025-04-27T15:13:02,14
