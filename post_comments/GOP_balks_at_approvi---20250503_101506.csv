"What does approval and appropriation matter when Trump, Musk, and DOGE unilaterally are cutting the agencies anyway?    It's not like they had any approval for the current cuts they're making. Why would they reinstate anything even if Republicans technically passed a budget with it?",rasa2013,2025-05-03T18:24:05,2
