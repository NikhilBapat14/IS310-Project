There has to be something deeply wrong with someone psychologically to sit there and have people BS you like this.,Darius2112,2025-04-30T16:32:34,16
The most ridiculous display of groveling that I had second-hand embarrassment just watching it.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-30T16:34:40,13

"Kissing his ass is one of the core requirements of being in the Trump administration. As long as you can do that well your other qualifications don't even matter. That kind of feedback loop is dangerous if you think about it because even if anyone in the administration has a brain (doubtful), none of them would tell him anything he doesn't want to hear.",-CJF-,2025-04-30T16:33:19,7
"It’s beating a dead horse at this point but really, imagine Obama having his cabinet sit in a room full of cameras and publicly praise him like this. Conservatives would lose their fucking minds.",pistilpeet,2025-04-30T16:45:18,5
"""Trump, never bashful about his achievements, [is usually the one doing the bragging.](https://apnews.com/united-states-government-89a763615db344f2b8f487e1eb1c5373) But in a two-hour game of one-upmanship before the television cameras on Wednesday, top Cabinet officials took turns drenching the president with praise that went beyond even the [usual levels of adulation](https://apnews.com/united-states-government-general-news-4faebdb12e334bb5b668f3158bf39ba5) from those who work for Trump.""  'There was Attorney General Pam Bondi, who claimed that Trump in his second term saved “258 million lives” due to the amount of fentanyl that his Justice Department has taken off the streets. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. thanked the president for “your vision and leadership, for giving me the 100 busiest days of my life.” Rubio said the 47 wrongfully detained Americans were returned home due to Trump’s “leadership and the diplomacy that was exercised.” However, the list of Americans was not immediately made public, and it was not clear which were being included in the tally.""""  ""Indeed, the praise wasn’t devoted just to the commander-in-chief. As an effusive Burgum spoke, he noted the “amazing group of people around the table” and added a quick aside to Trump: “You probably assembled the greatest Cabinet ever.”",ChiGuy6124,2025-04-30T16:28:30,5

"I wonder if his cabinet members tell their kids and grand kids to,” Shut up with all the whining, all I do at work all day is praise, praise, praise, I am worn out from child praising.”……June 14 we will all have to go to a birthday party. Can’t wait to see cabinet members try to outdo each other there.",KlaatuBarada1952,2025-04-30T16:46:48,3
