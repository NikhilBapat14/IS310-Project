"“Yeah, but it’s the death of poor people. And everyone knows that moral failing is the only way someone ends up in poverty. So they deserve to die. If they deserved to live, god would’ve blessed them with the money to treat their health issues, just like he did with me!”  -conservatives",A1sauc3d,2025-04-23T14:30:48,14

"Joe Biden's stupidity led to Trump getting elected, and Trump's administrations actions could lead to 30k deaths. In other words, Joe Biden indirectly led to 30k additional deaths.",18212182,2025-04-23T14:45:13,-3
I am not being funny. Musk and tech bros see people getting earned benefits as parasites. They think there are too many old people. RFK Jr. seems to not like disabled people. The philosophy of the Trump administration is that the deaths of poor and disabled people is acceptable.,FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-23T18:28:03,3
