"The left is so stunned that they lost so hard, they’re grasping for anything.  They’ve placed the blame on the campaign, not the candidate - so the fact Trump did so well reaching younger voters via social media interviews and such has them scurrying.  So they’re trying to “appeal to the youth”, and clearly failing miserably at it - thank God!    Their younger vote outreach is so painfully cringe.  And David F’ing Hog?  Seriously DNC?!!  Thank you!!!   **Thank You!!**  🙏🙏    He’s peak level angry asshole, combined with an ego and lack of self awareness that has created a little self centered angry boy, who runs around lecturing everyone.  Like the little Greta - Climate Change Hobgoblin girl.  He’s behaving as if he’s the forever leader is the DNC, I mean, bypassing the party leadership and setting up to primary older, less radical Democrats using his own group?  When you’re the vice chair of the DNC?  Whoah!! Nice Hogg boy!",cliffotn,2025-05-03T19:20:53,3
