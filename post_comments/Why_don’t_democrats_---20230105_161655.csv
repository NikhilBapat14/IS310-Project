"It's not just about having a person in the seat. It's about building a governing coalition, which means being able to command a majority, most of the time, especially on very basic matters. The Speaker ceremony is important because it's literally the most foundational possible thing a governing coalition can do, and it shows that a leader has the ability to get a majority. But right now, the Reps can't even pass that test.  If the Dems did help McCarthy get elected, what would be the point? The minute McCarthy tried to call his first vote, this would still happen. All it does is punt the problem down the road, or force the Dems to constantly be in a position where they are helping McCarthy do the job in a way the Dems don't agree with. What's the point of that?   Now, if McCarthy approached the Dems about a plan to gain some of their support in exchange for concessions about how he would lead his governing coalition, then we'd have a different story. Then it would make sense, depending on the deal, for Dems to join McCarthy's efforts to lead. But McCarthy has made no such overtures, and rather still plans to explicitly keep the Dems out of his governing coalition as much as humanly possible. Why would the Dems be leaping up to prop him up in that case? Especially when he can't even lead his own party?  This is actually not really about partisanship at all. It's about the basic math of democracies need to carry majorities to be able to function, and right now McCarthy can't clear that bar on the most basic, most simple of issues. The Dems helping McCarthy on one vote won't fix that fundamental issue unless they were willing to help him out on lots more votes...which obviously isn't a reasonable expectation.",mormagils,2023-01-06T10:02:07,8
"Why should they though?  The Republicans have loudly insisted for years (since Obama at least) that they won't work to pass any legislation advanced by the Democrats.    So why now should the Democrats help them?  The GOP will not respond in kind, and will most assuredly not recognize nor ever help the Democrats in the future.  This is exposing the serious deep-seated fissures in the GOP that go all the way back to the Tea Party loonies that got their start during Obama's first term.  And now the MAGA loonies are making it worse.  This is showing the GOP base just how petty and stupid their party is.  As that old quote goes, never interfere with your enemy when they are destroying themself.",Dr_Adequate,2023-01-06T09:15:55,11
This Atlantic article does an amazing breakdown of why it's bad for Democrats: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/kevin-mccarthy-house-republican-party-speakership/672648/,sleepsucks,2023-01-07T03:12:05,2
Because when your opponent is making a mistake don't interrupt them. Also it may look like an endorsement of him if they do.,tinylittlegnat,2023-01-08T15:10:05,2

Because  you'd have a democrat voting for  a republican.  .it would be political suicide   You could time the rest of thier career  on a stopwatch  Both for McCarthy and for whatever democrats voted for him,Greyhuk,2023-01-10T02:04:53,1

Why would the Dems be leaping up to prop him up in that case? Especially when he can't even lead his own party?  This is exactly it.  McCarthy making an overture to the Democrats would be seen as a YUUUGE sign of weakness by the hard-line Republicans who do not want to see any aid to the opposition.  They would turn on McCarthy and/or their voter base would turn on them.  McCarthy gaining even one Dem vote would wipe out maybe half of the Republican votes, maybe even more.",Dr_Adequate,2023-01-06T12:14:41,3
"The short answer is because McCarthy is going to get the nod eventually, and the house should have to do their jobs and stop embarrassing the country.  The more accurate answer is that McCarthy is spineless and lacks any real morals. He will absolutely capitulate whatever is necessary to get the position, and irreparable harm can come from making concessions to the freedom caucus ideologues.",[deleted],2023-01-06T13:10:29,2
Exactly this! It actually helps the Dems in the long run when their opponent is making a mistake and they get to sit back and watch it happen and use it as material for 2024.  The GOP made their bed and now they have to lie in it. The Dems have zero incentive to help them.,Kevin-W,2023-01-07T22:31:11,1
"With Spartz, Roy, Donalds, and Perry now voting for McCarthy, it's only a matter of time before McCarthy sews it up. Roy was a key thought leader in the holdouts, so his return to the fold is a big blow. Gaetz has been the most vocal of the holdouts but he really seems to have lost the plot--yesterday he voted three times for Trump for some inexplicable reason, and now he's back to pushing for Jim Jordan...a key McCarthy ally. He's really just lost the plot and seems to have no real organization. Donalds' return to McCarthy signals his time as a symbol of the holdouts is gone.  Oddly enough, the only real capable leader left in the holdouts seems to be Boebert. She right away knew Biggs was a bad choice, and when Gaetz's Trump vote stalled Donalds' run, she was quick to pivot to Kevin Hern. I think the only real obstacle to McCarthy's winning at this point is how well Boebert can rally the remaining holdouts with a coherent ideological message.",mormagils,2023-01-06T12:22:01,1
