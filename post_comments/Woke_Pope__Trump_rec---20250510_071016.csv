"So will everyone else in that movement. The thing with reactionary movements is that they self-select on selfishness and exceptionalism. The core reactionary idea is that society is a fixed moral and social hierarchy based on identity (i.e. we can do no wrong because of who we are, and deserve privileges for that same reason). But people need to be susceptible to some form of selfishness and exceptionalism in order to subscribe to it. They need to want to look down on others, to feel they deserve to be and have more, they need to feel special and chosen.   This is decidedly a double edged sword because that exceptionalism renders them blind to the inevitability of being ""othered"" themselves. And due to the selfishness, they'll never stand up for anyone else even before that happens, so there is never any solidarity to push back against internal purges.  They'll gleefully participate in the ostracism or persecution of others, and are then totally surprised when it happens to them too. And it has to happen, of course, because the ideology is hollow and wrong. There is nothing constructive there, no solutions for any problem, so instead there is a never ending need for scapegoats and distractions.  Unfortunately for everyone else, given access to power these movements tend to take society with them when they destroy themselves.",barryvm,2025-05-10T08:05:40,23
