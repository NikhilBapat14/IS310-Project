Yes it is. The market was trending down leading up to Election Day. As soon as Trump won it started to go back up and kept going up even past Inauguration Day. It only started dropping when he started doing stupid things.  Everyone has to know this is all trumps fault.,hmr0987,2025-05-01T14:39:57,8

"**TLDR:**  * **More than 100 days into his presidency,** [**Donald Trump**](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump) **says the** [**state of the stock market**](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-today-trump-biden-economy-q1-gdp-trade-tariffs-2025-4) **is his predecessor's fault. For now, his GOP allies on Capitol Hill are playing along.** * **""That will work now,"" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters. ""It won't work six months from now."" That leads to the question of when, exactly, a president can no longer reasonably attribute the state of the economy to his predecessor.** * **Most GOP senators who spoke with BI declined to provide a specific timeframe for when Trump should assume full responsibility for the state of the economy, though Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio offered that it would take about two years for Trump's new policies to fully make their mark.**",thisisinsider,2025-05-01T14:29:38,3

Biden did it Biden did it (unless it's good then look at all the great things Trump has done so fast! Fastest working president ever!) (/S),kiramon53,2025-05-01T16:12:01,1
"I applaud your optimism. ~50% of all Americans read below a 6th grade level. Fox News reaches the most of all major news networks, oh and CNN is also owned by a conservative pair all that with voter suppression. It will take something drastic like empty shelves and full on starvation to change some of their minds and it will probably start with some of the people in Trump’s camp flipping in my opinion. Exactly what I thought would happen if trump won over 6 months ago. Everyone who is informed saw all of this a long time ago.",Sleepylimebounty,2025-05-01T15:05:41,1

"Yeah. Kids in 1first grade don't read at a 6th grade lever but then again neither does tRump and his band of idiots.............   Fox News does not.... They are a joke. They lie way to much.   Yes, we all know tRump is a blathering idiot that has a reading level of about 5th grade. He never reads anything. You think he reads his EOs? Nope. They tell him in a nutshell what the EO says....then he signs it. They didn't even tell him when SCOTUS went 9-0 against him. They told him he won...so tRump claims.   tRumps entire cabinet are idiots. There isn't a brain between all of them and it shows...........",Harry_Mud,2025-05-01T16:38:43,0
