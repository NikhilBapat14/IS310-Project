"**The founders warned us about the dangers of an uneducated electorate**   **Thomas Jefferson**  Jefferson strongly advocated for education as a safeguard for democracy, stating: ‚ÄúIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.‚Äù  Jefferson believed an educated electorate was crucial to prevent manipulation by demagogues.  **John Adams**  Adams emphasized the necessity of morality and education, warning against ignorance: ‚ÄúLiberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people.‚Äù  He also noted the risks of democracy without a knowledgeable citizenry, stating democracies could degenerate into anarchy or despotism.  **James Madison**  Madison, in Federalist No. 10, expressed concerns about factions and demagoguery arising from an uninformed populace:  ‚ÄúA popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.‚Äù  **Implications**  The founders strongly believed that **education was essential to sustain democracy**, emphasizing the danger posed by ignorance or misinformation. They saw education as a necessary condition to maintain liberty, **avoid manipulation by demagogues**, and ensure stable governance.",devonjosephjoseph,2025-05-01T15:19:41,73

"He's an idiot but there's actually a point there, the main negative was a huge amount of imports due to trying to get ahead of the tariffs.
