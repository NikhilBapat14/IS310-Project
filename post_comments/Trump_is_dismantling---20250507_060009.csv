It's another reminder that Trump doesn't give a fuck about the working class. He never has.,zsreport,2025-05-07T06:00:31,82
"It's just a never ending game of illogical political bingo.  I look forward to just one day of not seeing a ""BREAKING NEWS: Trump administration...""  headline in my overnight emails.",aperson7780,2025-05-07T06:07:00,17
His entire candidacy and platform has always been a betrayal to the working class.,Lochstar,2025-05-07T07:24:49,11
I‚Äôm sorry. Who thought this guy would be pro-working class?,Ursus_Unusualis_7904,2025-05-07T08:47:28,12
"Yeah, it's pretty frustrating. Seems like every move is just making it harder for the average worker to get by. It's like they don't care about the people who actually keep everything running.",BunnyBlossomz,2025-05-07T06:16:15,10
"NIOSH is respected and emulated the world round. Not only is this a blow to US citizens, but it‚Äôs just one more example of Trump looking completely ludicrous and anti-American to those on the outside. Why the hell would a US president directly attack beacons of the US that others respect? He works for the lizard people.",tackle_bones,2025-05-07T08:16:13,6
Anyone else notice he‚Äôs done nothing to hurt a corporation or a billionaire?,angrypooka,2025-05-07T06:52:55,3
"it's not a betrayal, he's not part of the working class. He's fighting for his side of the class war dutifully.",robin-loves-u,2025-05-07T07:39:50,3
The decades of working class victories are going up in smoke under this administration.,BardaArmy,2025-05-07T07:41:25,3
"Look, most of the workers this impacts voted for this. And I really believe this is what they want. They don't want any government telling them they need to be safe or protected. They want less restrictions. They also want government handouts, but don't call them handouts. Oh, and they want the government to get rid of the brown people too.",ss_lbguy,2025-05-07T06:50:41,5
"Trump knows nothing about the working classs, other than it's fine to stiff contractors and threaten them with long legal battles if they don't accept a reduced fee.",Flaky-Jim,2025-05-07T08:40:14,2
GOP logic: *‚ÄùPeople will just stop working for that company if enough accidents happen!‚Äù*,CranberrySchnapps,2025-05-07T09:22:19,2

Time to go back to the mines kids ‚Ä¶ mom and dad lost their government jobs and everything from Walmart doubled in cost cuz everything comes from China.,CompetitivePirate251,2025-05-07T08:43:36,1
It‚Äôs not betrayal when the rest of us have been literally screeching about it for like 15 years. This is just accelerationism,Chemical-Package8245,2025-05-07T09:42:54,1

I love that Unions supported Trump,donttakerhisthewrong,2025-05-07T09:52:24,1
"The blame for this falls squarely on the DNC for failing to excite the voters enough.  Obviously Harris was 1000x better than Trump.  But the DNC acted entitled to our support, rather than earning it by wooing us.    Hopefully they learned their lesson.",insuproble,2025-05-07T10:27:11,-1

"He's been telling them that he doesn't give a fuck about them yet the working class keeps voting him. The only reason why they do is racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia.",n00bn00b,2025-05-07T09:07:34,5
Millions of idiots.,TeddyRivers,2025-05-07T09:32:50,9
No they thought he would anti the blacks and the gays.  And they ignored he hates the working class.,ZZartin,2025-05-07T11:02:30,2
"It's not ""like they don't care"". They don't. You heard him ""everything is computer"". The workers are unnecessary and disposable. This is all red tape to him while it's literally our lives and safety to the rest of us.",whichwitch9,2025-05-07T08:17:48,1
This is smooth brained fox news talking points. The voters decided they wanted chaos and they're getting it,epistaxis64,2025-05-07T11:00:34,6
"You cannot blame the DNC for Harris. It was Biden's decision to drop out way too late for a 50-state primary, making Harris the only logistically viable option.",MadRaymer,2025-05-07T11:42:34,5
We do. I work with mostly blue collar workers. They are fucking idiots,Soggy_Discussion7504,2025-05-07T11:45:17,6

"Not all of them voted based on him being pro-working class. And technically more people voted against him (either for other candidates or not voting at all) so there is some hope. But the slant of this article is that this is another betrayal of the working class and there is nothing about him that is pro-working class. It isn‚Äôt a betrayal, he is acting as expected.",Ursus_Unusualis_7904,2025-05-07T10:48:14,1
The DNC owed it to America to teach us what was at stake. They didn't bother.,insuproble,2025-05-07T11:05:55,2

Fuck that. Everyone with half a brain knew what we were up against. The voters are getting everything they deserve,epistaxis64,2025-05-07T11:32:19,7
Why do you need to get marching orders from someone else? Any citizen in the United States can vote for whomever they choose. Why are you looking to the DNC to ‚Äúexcite‚Äù you with a candidate?  I get that we voters are influenced more than ever these days but we also don‚Äôt vote. Young voters were practically absent this election.,FortyYearOldVirgin,2025-05-07T12:03:14,4
"False. Not voting is not voting. There can be many, many, reasons a person doesn‚Äôt vote, from apathy all the way to voter suppression.",Ursus_Unusualis_7904,2025-05-07T12:22:43,1
Choosing not to vote is the same as implicitly agreeing that you are fine whoever gets elected.,ZZartin,2025-05-07T12:26:10,2
"Not voting is not participating in democracy, thus you have no right to complain when your country is run by a dictator.   This nobel idea of avoiding the vote is weak sauce. George Carlin was fucking wrong.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-07T12:55:28,1
"So, you really think that people who experienced voter suppression, for example, so we unable to vote implicitly agree with whoever gets elected? Fuck that. We are all fucked if people think that shit.",Ursus_Unusualis_7904,2025-05-07T12:49:29,1
