"[President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig beautiful bill‚Äù is running into a wall](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/medicaid-republicans-divided-house-trump-bill?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) in the sharply divided House Republican conference, with tensions spiking over Speaker Mike Johnson‚Äôs handling of the party‚Äôs biggest sticking point: overhauling Medicaid.  As Johnson presses for a House vote before Memorial Day, the battlelines are becoming more pronounced, with Republicans in swing districts saying the sweeping bill can‚Äôt slash social safety net benefits while GOP hardliners are demanding trillions more in spending cuts ‚Äì far beyond what many centrist members are willing to swallow.  Those frustrations emerged in a two-hour meeting in Johnson‚Äôs leadership suite on Tuesday night, in which the speaker huddled with roughly a dozen GOP centrists who have refused to back any Medicaid changes that could hurt eligible Americans who rely on the program.  Inside the room, Johnson made one more attempt to sell those members on a contentious plan ‚Äî backed by the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and others ‚Äî to sharply reduce Medicaid payments to states that expanded the program under Obamacare, according to two people in the room. His push drew a rebuke from multiple centrists in the room, who believed that idea was already off the table, the people said.  ‚ÄúWe laid down the law,‚Äù one Republican member who had attended the meeting said of the firm position many members took.",cnn,2025-05-07T16:46:16,9

They will still pass anything Trump wants. Those Republican reps who claim to be against a bill will pass it. Even as they see their constituents suffer and start to raise hell they will still do it. All of these articles are a joke.,Fartenstein65,2025-05-07T20:41:14,1
"Kabuki theater.... it doesn't matter - there will be a package and the Dems will vote for it...  Currently the GOP tries to push this through reconciliation, but it will fail as there are too many factions not on board with parts of this plan. Moderate Blue state GOP-ers won't go for Medicaid cuts and want SALT caps raised. Fiscal conservatives want to cut more cost and won't go for lifting SALT caps.  Eventually a plan will be found that Trump will push for (he has no ideological stance and doesn't care about debt). But it will result in the GOP not being able to push this through reconciliation and will come to regular order.  Likely it's too 'big' and too 'beautiful' for the Freedom Caucus and they won' t be on board and will withhold their votes. So the GOP needs Dem votes to get it through regular order...  Now, the deal also contains lifting the debt ceiling and not doing so will cause the financial system to IMplode, as our system requires debt to grow.  The Dems will get weak in the knees and deliver the votes to get it through, while the fiscal conservatives can keep claiming they are against Govt largess.  At that point, the Dems became part of this administration.",tommyjaspers,2025-05-07T17:17:09,-1

"Who said anything about throwing Johnson a lifeline?  Innocent people are going to die because of the Republicans' healthcare policy.  Likely, some innocent people have been given a death sentence from USAid cuts alone. Even if the magic medicine fairy snapped her fingers and gave every American perfect health insurance, some number of people who don't deserve it will die because of diseases Republicans allowed to thrive untreated that would have been dealt with by a Harris administration.   To be okay with all of that, as long as it scores political points for your team, is thoroughly contemptable and utterly lacking in morality.   I understand that in the present situation, opponents of the regime don't have a strong voice and can't do much to affect the outcome. This is not democrats' fault. But if we want Democrats to win in the future, they have to do more than sit back and smugly eat popcorn while Republicans ruin people's lives, including the lives of innocent people who didn't vote Republican. When you have a voice, you have a moral obligation to spreak. That doesn't go away just because the regime will not listen.",PaxDramaticus,2025-05-07T22:35:05,1
