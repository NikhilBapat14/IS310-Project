"Anti-Christian bias?   Well, sounds like it's time to start reporting magas. They seem awfully biased against real Christians and biased towards anti-Christians.",Facehugger_35,2025-04-11T12:52:43,28
"I'm Catholic and I know they'll consider us the ""wrong Christian"" like before. I hope religious folks aren't fooled. The Pope has already condemned this administration so we're screwed eventually too.",catsoncrack420,2025-04-11T12:40:27,11
It sounds like they can just report Republicans.  I mean [Matthew 25:35-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A35-40&version=NIV) pretty much seems like the opposite of their platform.,repoocaj,2025-04-11T14:05:28,8

"9 catholics. Not a good look. In the area I'm at,  many catholics are opposed, or struggling with themselves. It is very dismal to see people call themselves Christians, and even catholics, when they are clearly behaving in a way that their god will condemn them for. Like, bro, you know if your god was real you'd be doing exactly what he said not to do, right?",Zestyclose_Pickle511,2025-04-11T19:36:52,4
