Classic  They’re now all of the sudden mental health experts when it comes to Fetterman and also Trump’s “cognitive decline.”,Holiday-Tie-574,2025-05-05T16:49:37,144
"“But this week, New York Magazine wrote, “John Fetterman insists he is in good health. But staffers past and present say they no longer recognize the man they once knew. … Former and current staffers paint a picture of an erratic senator who has become almost impossible to work for and whose mental-health situation is more serious and complicated than previously reported. No one is saying every controversial position (for example, his respectful relationship with Trump) stems from his mental health — but it’s become harder for them to tell which ones do.”  Sigh…  Same lefty behavior.  So his mental acuity is kick ass if he’s towing the DNC line. The second he disagrees? “He’s mental! He’s intellectually damaged!!!!”",cliffotn,2025-05-05T16:53:25,65
"Fetterman “surprised” and alienated his progressive “base” beginning on October 18, 2023 — eleven days after the worst one-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and nine days prior to the start of major IDF ground operations in Israel — when he rejected the notion that Israel should decline to respond to the October 7 massacre. The Left is up in arms due to the “gutting betrayal” when Fetterman declined to blame Israel for the slaughter of its own citizens by Hamas terrorists. It reveals the extent of the internal Democratic revolt that was kicked off when Fetterman objected to a progressive boycott of Israeli hummus by noting how nonplussed those same activists were to the “rape of Israeli women + girls.” After all, the truth hurts.",Ask4MD,2025-05-05T19:00:37,21
Particulary hilarious they talk shit about fetterman when Biden's pudin brain was drooling out of his earhole and no one seemed to notice it until he shat himself infront of the entire nation in a debate.,Chikaze,2025-05-06T02:48:41,7

"What a shocker! Mentally impaired people are fine as long as they march in lockstep, But if they don't......""You already know what it is!!"".  Dude is far more mentally clear now then he was at the time when he was elected. This is that bullshit Democrats always do when you step outta line.",jeepgrl50,2025-05-05T19:37:42,13
I guess he has to pay the price of only being 99% progressive.,cathbadh,2025-05-05T18:40:29,23
"i live in pennsylvania and fetterman is a democrat to his core. just check his voting record. even the ""conservative"" votes like confirming trumps cabinet picks are strategic for him because they were going to get confirmed anyway and now he can use those votes as appearing ""moderate"" to the purple state of PA. if you advocate for democratic policy fetterman is working for you. but those progressive dipshits are going to primary him next cycle and lose the seat entirely. cut off their nose to spite their face and all.  democrats are really bad at politicking.",PatTheBatsFatNutsack,2025-05-05T20:32:30,14

"LMAO! Not a single Dem was concerned when the guy had a stroke, and he both looked & sounded like some deranged homeless guy had wandered into the Capitol Building.  But the moment he starts say pro-Ireali stuff -- NOW he needs to resign.  (I'm not even particularly pro-Israel; the dog whistle trigger was just that obvious.)",BoredAtWork1976,2025-05-05T17:00:58,75
"It's absolutely all tribalism, down to the way they expect us to hear every single thing they say - look at the articles being posted over time, notice how it's all the same FamousGuys in a loop and most of them are commies.

This is the candidate that could barely even talk through most of his campaign and cancelled events due to his 'health reasons' meanwhile the entire democrat establishment was saying he's fit as a fiddle nothing to worry about here! If democrats had any credibility left I suppose someone would care.,ngoni,2025-05-05T20:34:14,16

"You don’t have to be far-right to notice that The Daily Wire stopped mocking Fetterman’s condition once they realized he’s strongly pro-Israel.  >Fetterman: “I think that simply is also where...let's talk about the trillions in...in massive tax or...uh, tax...uh, cuts to the corporate, uh, tax structure as well true.""  >Fetterman: “You talk about the, the, the Liber, the Liberty of State—Stateu, um, has never had an inscription inside that said, you know, send your, your tired, whole—huddered, uh, masses and put ‘em on buses and turn ‘em into a, a cheap political stunt  The Daily Wire mocked him relentlessly on X. Pretty tacky imo. Anyone who's had family or friends recovering from a stroke doesn't find this funny.",Highwiind-D4,2025-05-05T20:40:17,21
