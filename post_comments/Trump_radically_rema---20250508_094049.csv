"He is decimating our food system along with everything else.   *“Multiple parts of our food systems are now under attack,” said Teon Hayes, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy. At the same time, food prices and overall costs of living are continuing to rise. The result, she fears, will be escalating hunger and poverty, which will “come at the expense of Black and brown communities, immigrants, and other historically marginalized groups.”*",SAJ-13,2025-05-08T09:46:23,25

"So i guess you didn't read the article at all huh? This is the farmers and food businesses complaining about issues with food supply and the ability to continue. They have been completely and utterly fucked by this administration. This has **absolutely** nothing to do with people not having jobs to buy things. In fact, the article goes to point out how these *AMERICAN* job makers will not be able to employ the workers they need anymore, once again due to this administration.   But hey, live in your bubble denying reality.",Prof-Wernstrom,2025-05-08T10:39:34,5

I have a hard time believing you're real. There shouldn't be any food standards? Someone should pay extra to get bread without sawdust in it? Is that what you're trying to convey?,FederationEDH,2025-05-08T11:45:34,3
"How did that work out with Boeing?  There’s a natural contradiction in self enforcement, because it’s all about the bottom line, bonuses and stock options for senior management.  It’s not in their self interest to say recall a product that maybe contaminated unless forced to.  Then there’s the dismantling of the FDAs early warning system.",skypilo,2025-05-08T11:08:44,1
