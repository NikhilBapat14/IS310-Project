"Since Biden has been addressed, I decided to check the top 5 Republican candidates-  Trump- No mention on the issues page on his website. In his first term, his budget proposals cut spending on affordable housing programs, so not a great reputation. His current discussion of it pretty much only concerns ‘fixing the economy’ first and then I guess housing will sort itself out or he hasn’t come up with anything past that.  DeSantis- No mention on his website. Did pass a $711 million plan aimed at making housing more affordable that included some positive provisions for affordable-housing projects. Not sure if it has actually translated to better outcomes quite yet.  Vivek- No mention on website and no mention that I can find elsewhere. Not surprising given he is running as the Trump substitute/VP pick.  Haley- No mention on website or elsewhere that I can find.  Pence- No mention on website. When asked about solving housing, he took the same stance as Trump in that fixing the economy- more jobs, lower interest rates, etc.- is the first step in getting there. No current plan on what comes after that though.  Based on none of them referencing housing affordability or availability on their websites, it sounds like it isn’t much of a priority at all for any of these candidates",Philosophfries,2023-09-02T01:25:38,46

"Just look at how government plans have worked out so far when it comes to housing. Best to focus on making it easier to develop housing and sticking to ensuring building codes.   I’d support looking into restrictions on short-term rentals, restrictions on purchasing of homes by foreigners that do not live in the USA, and restrictions on corporations buying up single family homes if it leads to less choice.   Current policies have made it difficult to develop in most cities, created nightmarish housing projects, and created dysfunctional rent controls.

"Housing affordability is a major economic issue in many parts of the country right now, so it's definitely an important topic for candidates to address. While the 2024 election is still a ways off and fields of candidates are still developing, here are a few thoughts on where some may stand:  - Democratic candidates are more likely to emphasize increasing housing supply through things like rezoning for density, rental assistance programs, expanding affordable housing tax credits, etc.   - Republicans may focus more on reducing regulatory barriers that increase costs, like certain zoning restrictions and permitting processes. Some also call for tax breaks for home buyers.  - Candidate Joe Biden released a plan during the 2020 campaign that included $100 billion for affordable housing construction grants and rental assistance expansion.   - Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed bills to establish national rent control standards and fund new affordable housing construction.  - On the GOP side, Senator Tim Scott has introduced opportunity zones and proposed tax breaks to encourage home building.   - Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida pursued policies to increase supply like limiting impact fees on home builders.  So while specific 2024 platforms are still forming, addressing housing access and costs will likely be a major campaign issue across party lines given the widespread impacts of high real estate values.",Low_Astronaut_662,2024-04-21T08:21:50,1

"Just for the record, my brother and I have spent the last 2 years looking into buying local neighborhoods, making them easy access, and employing staff to maintain these neighborhoods.  Our focus is to create retirement neighborhoods, lower the cost of rent for elders, and supply staff to maintain all of the properties.  Initial investment would be around 45 million dollars. (200 homes at 200k+ each)(10 staff members to provide assistance to residents and maintain properties)  At $600 a month (a price we set based on average retirement payouts in our area) means 120k a month to pay the 10 employees, (figure 50k per month for the employees) and rebuild the initial investment to be able to make more neighborhoods of this nature in other areas.  This bill specifically would prevent us from making this investment.  While we could make a nonprofit, from which to pay ourselves absurd salaries, which would then be taxed as income as opposed to business taxes. (where we could claim expenses to offset the taxes)   Ideally, being able to create massive communities of this nature would be good for everyone.

"Bro they can’t even fix the affordability in their own government. Just look at the federal deficit.   Here, I’ll lay it out to you plain and simple. The price of housing depends on the number of homes moving onto the market. Plain and simple. First time home buyers usually can’t afford a new home, so they buy a used home. People sell their starter home and move into their second home. Thus, it should be obvious to everyone that if you want to fix housing affordability, you have to build more homes and condos for people to live in. People aren’t going to move without a new home there to buy because everyone needs housing. .",PassionPattern,2024-05-04T04:10:00,0

"> I feel like a candidate with a good plan to fix housing affordability could win a lot of votes.  I don't see this issue winning more votes for one side or the other. If the GOP candidate puts forward a plan, I doubt it will be enough for most liberal voters to overlook the rest of their platform. In addition, any plan from either major party is likely to fall in line with their existing platform. For conservatives, that would mean relying on private industry to put the people first and for liberals it would rely on government programs and protections that some on the right have been convinced aren't in their best interest.

"I have a theory that may be unpopular but please read and think about this. This is only a theory. I am not claiming this as absolute fact.   The housing crisis might be caused by individuals rather than the evil government or greedy corporations. Both of these groups likely aggravate the situation, but is either really the root cause?  Housing costs reflect what individuals are willing to pay. If nobody is willing to pay $500k for the average house, the prices have to come down. If you own a home and have two offers, one for $500k and one for $350k, of course you’re going to take the higher amount. Builders and existing home owners will always do the same and we can’t blame them for taking a high offer when we would do the same thing. Generally speaking, too many people are willing to go deep into debt to have a nicer house, car, boat, etc. This causes prices on everything to go up.   Now, when the prices start to go up, greedy corporations and individuals who can afford it see this trend and start buying up real estate. This creates more demand and prices spiral up.   Government officials think they can help by creating various programs to assist home buyers. This creates the illusion that consumers can afford more house, so the prices continue up.   Everyone needs housing, but do you need a bigger or better house right now?  If everyone who currently has housing just stays where they are, the market will shrink considerably. Values will fall and the greedy corporations will lose their shirts.   As I said, the same effect will happen with cars and toys as well. The consumers have the control. We just have to have the discipline to exert it.",thegarymarshall,2023-09-27T15:46:23,1

"A more realistic version of the capitalist argument is the that America has a 65% home ownership rate. By making housing more affordable, the default assumption is that you make houses cheaper (even if that’s not what you mean, that’s what people hear). This is bad news for about 65% of America cause for better or worse, homes are most people largest asset and most important investment (even though primary residences should be viewed as investments).   This crisis is an extremely tricky one to fix, and lots of people have strong opinions on what should be done. It’s risky to give a plan cause there isn’t a right answer, only wrong answers with differing degrees of side affects. (Build High/medium density units near downtown—> gentrification |build new suburban homes on the outskirts of town—> urban sprawl/cookie cutter houses people hate/leaves out lower class |limit corporations from investing—> kill demand too much and peoples assets decline, etc) Add that to the fact that when you say I’ll make houses affordable, then 65% of America is going to hear “they’re going to make my primary asset less valuable”. So if you hear anything it will likely be something like “first time homebuyer assistance” or tax deductions for homeowners. Those words make people happy, they are easier to implement, there are less moving parts and reliance on corporations to help make the plan work.   The plan that will piss off the fewest amount of people is to keep house prices flat. Which is arguably happening on average due to the fed raising interest rates.

I may be completely wrong - in which case, I would like to be corrected.  - The analyzed law came into effect in 2022, there has hardly been time for the effects to settle. I wouldn't be confident that the described effects reflect the lasting impact of the legislation, and the authors themselves say that ""Over longer horizons, the effects [might give] rise to more complicated dynamics"". - If this law really is a ban, it is not similar to the proposed US legislation as described here. It would not eliminate investor owned rental supply (in the case of the Netherlands, in the participating municipalities), but reduce and/or distribute it. A single owner owning more than fifty properties would be disincentivized, not banned, hopefully reducing the accumulation of a limited resource in few hands. - The authors say that ""The policy was primarily introduced due to the pervasive perception that buy-to-let purchases adversely affected neighborhood livability"" - i.e. a goal was to displace poorer renters in favor of more well off home owners - and that this could be a factor in the legislation not actually lowering prices. Effective incentives for selling to current occupants could negate that. - Another possible factor they identify is ""that the (unobserved) reservation prices of investors and regular home-buyers are similar. In such a case, investors might still successfully secure properties by leveraging superior negotiation skills, unconstrained borrowing capacity, or alternative strategies [...]"" In that case, I would say individual buyers being able to buy homes at market price *is* already a success, and personally I would expect that this demand finally being met would lead to prices falling on a longer timeline.

"So, a couple of things right off the bat.  Page 5 section (bb)  the government will have the right to preemptively purchase a property, this is regardless of whether the person wants to sell it or not, and can do so through nonprofits.  Under the standard practice of use of imminent domain, they can purchase it at the tax value instead of market value.  So even if someone just bought a place and spent money fixing it or building, there is no section that requires reimbursement for that money spent by the landowner they are purchasing it from.  Page 7 under qualified homes, this is to include townhouses and rowhouses, each unit being treated as a single family home.

You could start a non-profit and get money from the government to buy large numbers of rental properties, drive up the rental cost, and pay your non-profit staff and board large amounts of money without it costing the people who start it anything.

"You are wrong. I’m a CPA so I know a bit about assets and liabilities.    An asset is something that has value. A structure that provides you shelter (aka a home) is an asset. A liability is an obligation to pay someone. A mortgage is an obligation to pay the bank in exchange for the money they lent you up front. Those two are tied together but are not the same. So even if your underwater on your mortgage, your house is still an asset, it’s just less valuable then the liabilities that are associated with it.   As far as the “mostly true” rule you mentioned, I can think of countless examples of where that’s total BS. Patents are assets with no cash flow (and if your getting technical you had to pay to get it and then legal fees to defend it if needed so it’s cash flow negative). Long term leases are now technically assets (see ASC 842) which once again are cash flow negative. Non dividend Stocks that you own as an individual have no cash flow and are assets. Or at a bigger picture all those VCs that pump money into start ups that aren’t profitable? The VCs own part of the company which is an asset but they are also cash flow negative.

"False. A home is an asset, the mortgage is a liability.  When the mortgage is smaller than the value of the asset, you have equity in your home.

I paid for it, but it is worth something and I owe nothing.

Second, the subsection on page five is a part of a definition of Community Land Bank, which is just one type of entities that is excepted from being disqualified, so it's a definition of one of multiple exceptions to an exception. It's not saying the government can preemptively purchase any property, it's just the criteria for a Community Land Bank to get a pass.",caw_the_crow,2023-09-10T03:59:38,2
"Page 5 (bb) is defining what a land trust or land bank is, it is not creating it. This is a tax bill and no where in the bill does it create or give new powers to any government entity. So a government land trust as described there already has the right to buy those properties, what it is saying is that in the year the owner of the property sells the property to a land bank, or any non-profit, they get to declare interest expense for that year on their taxes.  Page 7, that is exactly what I expected it to mean. If an individual owns more than 12 townhouses with 4 units each, they probably need employees to maintain those properties, if not, they are likely a slum lord and I'm not interested in protecting the rights of slum lords. Now, you correctly point out this only impacts taxpayers filing a 1040 with a schedule C. If they simply create a 1065 Partnership or 1120/ 1120S, they will be able to own as many homes as they want. This bill falls short of stopping predatory behavior by corporations and limits it to individuals. It almost seems like one of those bills designed to get votes while addressing a problem that doesn't exist. Property owners I know with more than a dozen properties generally file a 1065 or 1120S and then file the K1 on their 1040.  Also, you mention a small family enterprise... a husband can own 49 properties under this bill while his wife can own 49 and this daughter or son could own 49... that is a pretty large family operation worth  $250M if the average home cost is $200k.  Qualified non-profits... They spell out pretty well what thos means. When Qualified non-profits are operating with government programs they are required to undergo yellow-book audits and submit the audited financial statements to the government each year. You cannot just start one and steal homes and jack up the rent. They are rent controlled through the programs. If you want to get rich with a non profit, there are better ways, but this is not the right board for that discussion.  It seems you are reading things into the bill that are not there.

Now I realize just because he said it doesn't make it the word of God, but at the same time, just because a bank or government says it is something doesn't mean it's true either. They both exist to profit off of you, me, and everyone else. You are definitely correct with your asset definition. However if going off the something with value definition. A trashbag, a used tampon, and a cigarette pack cellophane are all assets. People buy them, so they have value...

It just seems that helping them make sound judgements for themselves is better than padding someone elses profits. While I concede to your knowledge in your area of expertise in almost all you have said. The home your living in (while having value for sure) is taking money away from you on a monthly/yearly basis. Add in interest and any other extra expenses, and you might not even break even if you need to sell it in a hurry or in a bad market. Yes I realize that is true of almost anything. Yes you still get atleast some money back regardless. Yes it has value.

For example if I bought a Rolex and one day it became super unfashionable to wear one to the point it wasn’t even worth wearing anymore, I’d be sad I wasted so much money but I’d move on pretty quick. But my home value is different cause I have a mortgage. I own a 3 bedroom house and have 2 kids and it’s already tight on space. If i decided I want another kid but my home dropped 25% in value (which would be material/significant) then I would have to consider sacrificing more of the limited space I have, or pay over $100k (which I don’t have) to get out of my mortgage and buy a bigger house with another bedroom.

"I get what your saying about easy way to remember it. But I still think that’s the wrong interpretation. I’ve never read the book but I know the concept from the book that you’re talking about.   What he’s taking about is how to view purchases if your goal in life is to build wealth. Your a bit off when you said look at it from a cashflow perspective. What he’s actually saying is look at it from a future economic benefit perspective. In other words if you buy a fancy car, it’s going to cost money to buy, maintain, and at the end of its life your going to sell it for less then you bought it for. That’s (in his view) a “liability”. On the other side. If you buy a big fancy house, you spend money to buy it, maintain it, and when you go to sell it, you will likely get more money than you put into it. That is (in his view) an asset. This perspective focuses on putting money towards building net worth and labels good assets (things that increase NW) as assets. And everything else as liabilities.   The car in that example is still an asset. It’s just a bad asset since it loses value over time. So from a rich dad poor dad perspective it’s a liability but from a financial perspective it’s an asset.   This is also an oversimplified version of it too. But at its core, it’s important to remember that the house (asset) and all the expenses (liabilities) except for prop taxes are separate things. Your not required to buy a house with a mortgage, or more realistically, once you pay off your mortgage, you still have that asset but the separate liability (mortgage) is gone. You aren’t required to pay for repairs, it’s a good idea to do so, but it’s not required. If you don’t then your asset value drops but your liability stays the same. If your house appreciates in value, your asset increases but your liability (mortgage) stays the same. The asset (house) and liabilities (expenses) are definitely related, but not the same. There are also some expenses that increase home value (renovations for example). Essentially at the end of the day you have a home (an asset) and expenses to maintain or improve the value of that asset, but they are not required and are not the same financial entity.",GroundbreakingRun186,2023-09-10T09:06:36,1
