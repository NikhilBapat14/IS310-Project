The plan prompted a rebuke from the DNC chair, who said officers should remain neutral. >  > Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist working with a handful of potential 2028 contenders, said he still feels it will “***take a lot of coaching for Democrats to understand we cannot go back to the old system***.

"Yes, the Democratic Party must abandon its socially liberal / economically conservative contradictions.   It , or its successor , must attract the vast numbers of forgotten , disengaged non-voters who have been screwed over by both sides for decades. It needs to focus on donors who are prepared to pay more taxes for an equitable society.   Only then can it marshal the forces required for fundamental and comprehensive constitutional and electoral reform.   At this point in American history it appears to be a distant fantasy as the USA has devolved into a dysfunctional failed state.  The rule of law has been eroded to the point that the definition of a failed state has been fully met and is undeniable.  It is now arresting judges in their chambers and ignoring court orders while it deports willy-nilly without hearings. Two year old US citizens are now being deported under this regime.

Think about New Deal Democrats that largely held control of the legislature and statehouses for 50 years.  When Reagan crushed Carter, Democrats responded by moving away from broad, bottom-up politics. Clinton's push for social safety cuts, financial deregulation, and tough on crime policies were functionally GOP policies softened slightly.  I think Democrats stopped offering an affirmative vision of the role of the government and it's the reason the party went from being the working man's party that defended civil rights to being the (perceived) party of bourgeois, identitarian middle-class college educated liberal.  For workers, minorities, and others their message comes across more as ""well obviously the Republicans are worse.""  Democrats economic policy is too indistinguishable from Republicans for low-info voters. And when Democrats are in power, they let arcane senate rules or polling or focus groups get in the way of sweeping promises. The ACA was watered down to appease Joe Lieberman. Minimum wage hike got spiked under Biden by the senate parliamentarian.  Voters who would support Democrats are tired of hearing why democrats supposedly can't accomplish goals for the vast majority of Americans..so those people aren't motivated to vote. The GOP keeps their party at heel because the moment they get a majority, they don't pursue bipartisanship in the name of bipartisanshop. They don't let senate rules get in their way. They ram home their agenda. And it keeps their voters loyal.  I'm a vote blue no matter who guy, but Democrats really need to look inward about why so many people say ""both parties are the same.""

Isn't that because the senate rules aren't in their way, because they have near-unanimity on core issues?

In this last election the choice -- for anyone paying any attention at all -- was fascism and corruption and the destruction of our democracy, or not those things.

"> Yes, I want all the shiny policies they SHOULD be offering.   You want the shiny policies *you* prefer. Advocating those shiny policies would cost them other voters who disagree with you.   Look at Bernie. He admitted that he lost in 2016 because he couldn't bring in the boomer vote. Then he inexplicably ran the same youth-oriented campaign in 2020 and again lost because he couldn't bring in the boomer vote. I have no idea why he didn't reach out to boomer voters, using FDR and the New Deal as a talking point to try to make his case, but maybe it was simply that he knew from internal polling it wouldn't be effective. The Democratic party is a big tent, and progressives are a minority within it.   What you want would require hard work, the kind of work AOC is doing. It also wouldn't happen overnight.

I’m not the only person who is disillusioned by the democrats, they’ve had 10 years to figure out how to deal with Trump and when they did have power, they couldn’t even extend the child tax credit and sent millions of kids back into poverty. AOC seems like the outlier in the party, and they even seem actively hostile towards her brand of politics. Everything they’re doing makes it seem like they’re trying to pivot to the right.

Given a choice between fascism and AOC's approach of doing the long, hard work of building the kind of base that could *in the long run* get us to the kind of policies you would like to see, you'd pick fascism?  If you like AOC's policy ideas, I'd encourage you to look more closely at AOC's strategy for getting there. It's not the instant gratification you seem to be demanding, it's a long-term plan. She's smart and pragmatic. And she's not giving up or fucking off to Mexico. She committed to doing the hard work to build up the progressive base so that *eventually* these things become possible.

"After everything that has happened in the last 10 years I would never say anything has a zero percent chance of happening. A lot of previously “impossible” things have happened. Working towards that is enough for me but democrats in congress probably think that idea is radical.   M4A has around 60% of respondents view it favorably depending on how it’s asked. If there was a good messenger for the policy then ~60% supporting is a good starting position. Based on the fact that Trump won twice with zero specific policy goals besides mass deportations, I don’t think people care about the specifics as long as they’re shown to save money (which taxpayers would in a nationalized system).   I like AOC’s policy’s and approach, I agree with her on almost everything. I’ve even seen her speak recently. I however don’t agree with the Democratic Party as a whole and I believe if they don’t change soon, we’re doomed to fascism anyway. Shit, it might already be too late depending on how authoritarian the republicans decide to get in 26 and 28.   The republicans got to where they’re at from decades of calculated steps and planning in all three branches of government and the media. It’s no surprise that Fox News is the most watched “news” in the country. They’ve taken over the judiciary and shaped it through think tanks like the heritage foundation and federalist society. Their most vocal member’s basically ran out anybody that wasn’t in favor of their policies no matter how unpopular they are with the general public (ie abortion). They spent decades gerrymandering a ton of districts around the country basically unencumbered. Democrats aren’t even *trying* to build any apparatus like that right now. Honestly they should have started in 2018, even 2020 or 2022 would’ve been nice. AOC is not going to do it alone.   How can you blame me for being doom and gloom about the current situation?

Yes, if you're sufficiently vague about it. That includes not explaining what Bernie means by M4A.

"I’m well aware of the process to add a constitutional amendment. It’s tough but I think saying zero percent chance isn’t accurate based on how many “impossible” things have happened in the last decade.   Literally every developed nation in the world has figured out universal healthcare. It is not that hard to figure it out if our politicians had the political will. One of the issues is our populace being propagandized into thinking our current system is fine and anything else would be catastrophic.   > It's not feeling doomy that's the problem, it's wanting to ""burn it all down"" if you don't get the exact things you want and get them now.
