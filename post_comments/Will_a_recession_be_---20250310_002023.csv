"Trump voters are on a spectrum from diehard cultist to somewhat reluctant. I have no doubt that a recession would peel off some of the reluctant voters who blamed Biden for inflation or whatever. But I do think that most Trump voters are in the diehard cultist category, and I think your estimate of 35-38% seems about right.   MAGA will respond to a recession the same way they respond to everything else:    \-""There is no recession."" Cook the books and engage in recession denialism.    \-""If there is, it's not our fault."" Blame it on allies and trade partners for not giving into Trump's ridiculous tariffs.    \-""If it is, we are justified."" The recession is a detox from government spending and is necessary to lay the groundwork for the golden age.   This isn't just me speculating, either. They have already started saying these things. This type of layered response where you have backup excuses for your excuses and you never admit you are wrong but just move the goalposts is classic MAGA. These people have to be written off. Go around them or through them.",chudforthechudgod,2025-03-10T04:45:59,1138

No. His supporters who say they overlook his cringe/unethical behavior because they only care about the economy are lying. They want to say slurs on FB and tell off-color jokes on purpose to offend people and cat call women. Thats the only thing Trump keeps delivering.   My own father has sworn non-stop he cares about nothing but the economy—but he ignores every economic indicator that tells a story that challenges his existing beliefs. However he is gleeful over the prospect of any woman (usually under the pretext of being trans) who doesn’t properly present as feminine being harassed or made to answer for her existence.,Impossible_Ad9324,2025-03-10T04:51:14,204

"The thing almost universally found among cults and cult leaders is that while many of them wake up to the con many do not.  Those people are gone.  Unreachable.  Ignorant.  With no reason to engage.  Trump's approval sits at what +/-43%?  But his *base* is around 35% so he'll never go lower than that.  Those are the real cultists.  Back to the good news.  The charisma people find in cult leaders is not transferable.  There is no ""next man up"" and, if there is, he or she always fails in scandal of their own before having the chance to be truly evil.  That 35% won't be peeled away by a recession hitting them hardest as they watch programs they need be stripped away from them.  They also won't be dutifully loyal to JD Vance (who has the charisma of a severed foot) or any other of the MAGA cheerleaders.    When Trump dies, and I check every day, his cult may flicker for a while but, in reality, it dies with him.

"Look at what's happening right now in South Korea, another country that has the polarization issues that we're seeing in America right now. In December of last year, their president Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law in the country because he was frustrated that the legislature was controlled by the opposition party.   There is evidence that he, among other things, tried to create a border incident to justify the martial law, and told the army leadership to arrest opposition politicians. He was impeached and arrested, though his impeachment has to be reviewed by their Constitutional Court.   His approval ratings went up in January 2025.   This is in a country that only became a democracy in the late 80s after years of martial law, so in living memory of many of its citizens. They remember the repression and riot police called out on protesters. They remember stories of activists disappearing. And yet you have pro-Yoon protests in Seoul right now.   So if people remember the bad times under martial law and still support Yoon, a little thing like a recession isn't going to do much to true believers like you see in the GOP.   And to make it more absurd, one of Yoon's defenders said that the president declared martial law because he was lonely.",SlyReference,2025-03-10T07:48:12,5

"I don't think it will. I watched Fox News for the last 3 months and I had an X account and truth social, just to see what these people were seeing and hearing. Trump and his administration have created a complete alternate reality for these people, they trust nobody but him and will hang on to every one of his words like truth. All he will have to say is that it is so and so's fault and they will 100% back it. These people are willing to give up their kids their families their parents their grandchildren for this, so no, it won't. Me and my son are living on my parents property and I have seen how this has affected them. My father was a history and war buff. He is the only person I would go to for advice about other people. He was the only person I knew that could see reality and wasn't afraid of it. He's the only person I knew that would question things all of the time.   He's the one who told me you don't trust what a person says, you trust what you see.   He also told me you don't trust a liar, and you don't think you can out smart a liar, you will eventually find yourself lost in their lies.   Now, he is lost. It's truly his wife's doing, because she is so ego-identified with Trump. She was always vulnerable to Elitism, hierarchy, and winning. She fell in years ago, and has slowly brought him down with her. I assume it was difficult at first, but what man would always want to argue about unimportant (at the time) politics. Years later, he is fully buried.  I'm trying to slowly pull him out, but I also think it may be wrong to do to him if I love him. He is about to retire and they live out in the country.   I sat in their living room 2 nights ago as she turned on FOX, and just sat their correcting the lies she was just simply repeating to my father, when he asked questions about things. It was so crazy to watch. He'd not fully understand OR not see the sense in something said, And she would immediately and loudly make singular simple statements as fact and truth, each time, as if she was a Whitehouse press secretary in the know. My dad always just believes her, likely due to the way she says it. Except this time, I politely and quietly corrected each one of her separate three statements. I then asked her after the last one where she got this information. Then she just sat in silence her about 30 seconds, and then said talk radio, which could be true, but she does know the week prior that I told my dad Fox News was either telling flat out lies, distorting the truth, or only telling half of it, whichever one of those three lead to the outcome they were looking for.

"Diehards historically *do not* peel back their support once it becomes part of their identity.  Hitler lost 1% of his support from his last fair election to a 1950s, despite allied efforts to denazify Germany. Italians largely like Benito Mussolini even after his death, idealizing his regime as a low crime, high prosperity time. Japan continued to support Emporer Hirohito even after their defeat.  So it didn't matter if the leader killed him, was killed by others, or merely lost. None lost support while their diehards lived, and even afterwards they've all seen rising tides of support among youth today.  Today, authoritarian leaders are among the most popular, even when their countries suffer. Russia loves Putin despite hardships suffered as a result of sanctions. The Philippines elected the son of the autocratic leader that ruled under martial law and ended his regime with the worst recession in Philippines history.

I don't hear so many people yelling at politicians about egg prices conflating it with Bidenflation/Trumpflation.  Would a recession that results in private sector job losses count? Maybe for some.

"No, Trump loyalists (as opposed to reluctant Trump voters) are voting for Trump for reasons that are both cultural and sociological: Basically, they see him as « one of their own ».   Polls and sociological analysis of far-right voters in western countries all say the same things: the people most likely to vote for the far-right (whether Trump or Le Pen or whoever is the local far-right leader) are poor white people who do not have a college education and live in rural areas. This includes a lot of blue collar workers, which the left finds it hard to admit, because they think blue collar workers should naturally be against billionnaires like Trump.   But those poor white people do not see billionnaires as their enemy, they see upper-middle class college-educated people who live in cities and suburbs (who are also the people most likely to vote for the left and center) as their enemy, and they see people like Trump as allies in that fight. In a way, this is still class warfare, but it is the rural poor versus the urban middle class, not the working class versus the bourgeoisie. And that political fight is occuring mostly because of deep cultural differences and clashing worldviews, not just for economical reasons (although those still play a part). A recession will not change that.   Then you also have on top of that the diehard Republicans who cannot imagine voting for a Democrat, even if they don’t like Trump. This is a problem when you only get two mainstream political parties in a democracy.   The people who voted for Trump for mostly economic reasons are going to stop voting for him, of course, and that may be enough for the Democrats to win the next elections.

"if they had voted on economic issues, very possibly.   but they didn't vote on economic issues, because conservatives don't *really* actually give a shit about economics. the essence of conservatism is and always has been social authoritarianism, conformity, and hierarchy - and that's what they voted for. there's three *known* white supremacists in the employ of the administration, the leader of which broke bread with an open-and-shut Nazi prior to his election.  to any decent person, these would be dealbreakers. I share this country with 50 million people who these four people hate with every fiber of their being. to a conservative, that's a feature - or at the very least, isn't a dealbreaker.  it just goes back to the original thesis: if they had voted along economic issues, it would be (and for some, certainly, they will rescind support). the vast majority of them voted for bigotry. a recession doesn't change that, so they can't be expected to move their position away from him. conservatives are an existential threat to all people, everywhere.",the_calibre_cat,2025-03-11T17:17:25,3

Next, they have to experience those truths in their own lives, the good, bad, and the boring ones, but they have to experience that what they are being told lines up with reality. The problem the world has right now is the dissonance between how separate groups view reality. Many people have allowed themselves to be comfortable with a carefully curated view and experience of reality. They only seek out the information that will back up their established ""idea"" of existence and either ignore or demonize those views and ideas that clash with their own. We now live in a world that has people that outright have such a skewed view of reality that they have allowed everything they hate to be in control of their lives. And that would be bad enough, but enough of the fine citizens of the U.S. chose to vote with their fear and greed and got their Orange Jesus elected. Now, the already marginalized and overlooked groups are being hurt worse and more often than ever. I have posted this a few times, but in my opinion, whatever happens, and whenever that thing does happen, and MAGA members choose to come back over to this side of sanity, they must;  1. Denounce their vote and anything tied to that destructive movement. 2. Apologize for the desolation and anguish that their choice has already caused. 3. Somehow, some way convince the rest of civilization that they ***fully understand*** that, bigotry, greed, and fear should never be used to determine other peoples' fates; those traits in society should be shunned and not idolized, that empathy, justice, and equality are the values that should dictate any course of action a government takes, especially any by the U.S.",siteofsanity,2025-03-11T16:11:48,2

Catching and releasing to the interior 2-3 million migrants a year as an immigration policy, then giving them tax payer funded transportation & housing.

"A recession is unlikely to sway hardcore Trump loyalists. His base has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to him, even in the face of major controversies, legal battles, and economic turbulence. If a recession were to occur under a second Biden term, it would likely be framed as the result of Democratic policies, inflationary spending, and global instability beyond Trump's control. If it happens under Trump, the narrative will shift to blaming the ""deep state,"" media manipulation, or economic sabotage by political enemies.  Trump's ability to shape narratives and cast himself as a victim of an unfair system has been one of his greatest political strengths. His base has shown a remarkable ability to internalize and repeat these narratives, often dismissing mainstream economic analysis as partisan propaganda. Timing does matter—if a recession hits right before an election, it could impact undecided voters, but for MAGA loyalists, economic pain would likely be seen as a temporary struggle in a larger fight against perceived enemies.  Ultimately, Trump's core supporters have invested so much into his movement that abandoning him over an economic downturn seems highly unlikely.",SpiritFlimsy7446,2025-03-10T20:44:08,1

It includes doing things only for ""real Americans"" and not helping others with their taxes. Ironically his base includes Americans least likely to be paying taxes, both the ultra rich and the dirt poor. A recession that hurts others actually strengthens their allegiance towards Trump because he's hurting others so they suffer just like Trump's base has been suffering. He's ""leveling the playing field"". It's a zero sum game in their minds where somebody else has to lose for them to win. So hurting ""others"" is like chemotherapy to them.

"The loyalists believe they can't read the news, so they are not critically thinking. I don't know if they will be swayed because of the Groupthink. They are afraid of dissension. So if you are someone who has ever overcome the fear of being different, you aren't mentally trapped where they are. Think of a flock of sheep walking off the edge of a cliff but they just keep walking. This conformity is the reason we organize well as a species and also an inherent bug in our makeup that can be exploited by bad people. They are Republicans or Christians or whatever and they do what the others in their group do regardless of whether it fits traditional Republican or Christian values. Ironically, Republicans believe in the Constitution, but they are backing someone who bars protests, tries to take away checks and balances, and goes after people in his own country who speak against him. Christians are supposed to love one another but they are backing someone who hates immigrants, assaults women, does everything he can to stop people of color from making progress, and threatens and turns his back on allied countries. If these people thought critically, we wouldn't be here. Dissension is a threat to humans because you can be thrown out of your group and not be able to access resources. In our biological evolution, this would probably lead to a struggle for survival or such as was the case in the Salem witch trials, speaking out or not conforming, could probably get you killed. If we want to unify as a species, but go forward with better policies, we can't keep creating separate groups and thinking that reasoning with people or making them feel guilty is going to change them. In separate groups, humans kill each other sometimes and then blame it on the other group. We have to work with our biology.

"No, I'm not sure what democrats think deinflation looks like, or even regular old deflation. The people (America,) voted in trump to reduce inflation to the point of de-inflation, thats literally the job we pressured the next president to do, and no Democrat president can handle because they don't know basic economics. What that entails is job loss basically. People have to lose their jobs, so they spend their savings, and the government can burn that money out of existence.   That's how we have to get our economy under control because of rampant democrat deficit spending, which required printing and devaluing a shit ton of our money. The correction is the exact opposite, burning that printed, worthless money. You have to get rid of jobs and end subsidies to do that. The brilliant thing our government is doing, is firing federal government workers to accomplish that, keeping our economy strong and eliminating useless waste instead of real jobs. This specifically targets wasted money for destruction instead of hard working peoples'. It takes care of both issues at once, and it helps fulfill other campaign promises, like bringing our budget back into balance.   We can't just keep printing out money to keep the federal historical road cone preservation museum open, or the department of African development, and we can't keep incentivising broken homes and absent parents.

"I’m gonna have to disagree with you somewhat. Left coded policies were problematic in many ways yet no one on the left has really looked back on that time with a critical lens. I’ll give you a few examples:  * the CDC originally [not recommending masks](https://time.com/5794729/coronavirus-face-masks/#).   > Doctors and health experts keep spreading the word. “Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!” tweeted Dr. Jerome Adams, the U.S. Surgeon General, on Feb. 29. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!” In an interview with Fox & Friends, Adams said that wearing a mask can even increase your risk of getting the virus. “Folks who don’t know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus.”  This was incredibly damaging to the reputation of the CDC and to the medical institution writ large.   * Early on the govt originally sold the shutdowns as “flatten the curve”. This made sense - let’s try to spread out infection to prevent overwhelming hospitals. However, after the curve was flattened, the policy didn’t change, and no reason was given as to why masking/shutdowns should continue, bar “well you’re killing people otherwise”.  * Public shaming from liberals. I live in NYC. I’m fairly liberal myself. The first memory of me not wearing a mask **outside**, was in July 2021. That’s right. For 1.5 years the social norm was to wear a mask *outside*, and failing to do so meant stares and gasps. None of this was borne out of science. But such was the cultural zeitgeist, and this is partly the reason for the conservative revival.   * No discussion of policy tradeoffs. Schools shutdown for 2 years or so, doing untold harm to a generation of children. Yet there was basically zero discussion around the cost of shutdowns. If you so much as tried to start a discussion, you’d be told “how dare you, you’re killing people”. As if the same can’t be said about anything in life. We get in a car to drive to work despite the dangers. We do other dangerous things. But we do so because the tradeoff is worth it. No such discussion was had about the effect of shutdown on schools and work.  And btw, a lot of the kids impacted by this ended up becoming dissolutions and voted for Trump.    Ok. End of rant. I’m not saying that the magas weren’t stupid in their own way. I just want to shed light on how liberals think they never make mistakes and are always right.

But at the same time, if those issues that created the problem to begin with aren't worked through and healed they will likely just continue to want to hide from that.

"People also like to forget that Trump was already president and deregulated and completely gutted the FDA and USDA removing safety regulations on agriculture.

You see throughout all industries the consolidation of business by large corporations and the manufacturing of supply chain shortages.  Thats what Trump did.  And now egg production is now almost entirely controlled by private equity, they intentionally kill off healthy egg laying hens, over crowd livestock to facilitate the spread of diseases like avian bird flu.  They fight against safety regulations like fire suppression systems in barns, and export increasing amount of product overseas all to create artificial supply chain shortages domestically to justify large price increases to consumers.  Biden is a corporatist Democrat who really did not address the underlying problem Trump created and instead continued Trumps economic policies.  He didnt even remove Powell for cause.

"\>When they say it is to create more Americans jobs, we were already at record low unemployment so we couldn’t even fill the American jobs as it was.  The argument (and this is not my argument but is their argument) is something like this - manufacturing jobs, historically speaking, pay higher wages than service sector jobs. Part of this is due to unionization part of this is because manufactured goods demand higher prices than services. Part of this is the limited labor pool due to geography.  If you increase the number of manufacturing jobs by artificially increasing the prices of foreign goods, domestic manufactured goods (which are sometimes higher quality) will look better by comparison, growing the industry. A growing industry will drive more workers towards these professions, enticed by higher wages. There's also the education factor - manufacturing jobs typically require less formal education. With a college rate that is closing in on 2 female graduates for every male graduate, this is seen as a valid way for men to make a living.

"The left-leaning animosity towards conservatives is because the latter views the left's mere existence as a insult against whatever their own view of how the natural order is supposed to play out, specifically the conservative views on how the ""undesirables"" of society are defined, identified, and treated. At no point do both sides agree on what makes some an ""undesirable"", how we screen them out, and what we do with them unless it's a cartoonishly open and shut case and even then Americans will find a way to struggle.  You can accuse the left of being self-declared arbiters of their moral reality, and you might even be partly correct. However, the leftist stance is to maximize individual happiness and freedoms and minimizing unnecessary suffering and unfairness created by systemic problems, what exactly is the other side offering? How the old ways were more enjoyable for some people as long as they were part of the group that had the complete upper hand over the rest but that's okay?  Even if Americans from both sides are guilty of playing the ""see reality my way or else"" game, conservatives as a group seem unique in that they find it acceptable if not desirable to bookend this sentence with variations of ""be destroyed, smeared, dehumanized, sent away"" or some other childish response because leaving others alone just isn't good enough for some reason.

"That's a disingenuous argument because it ignores all context. The context in which the ""inflation will be transitory""-comment was made was with regard to interest hikes by the FED.

So yes, inflation rates eventually came back down to earth again - but only after a central bank intervention which caused a lot of economic pain for borrowers, prospective home owners etc.  And yes, an argument can be made that the extent of the economic pain could have been smaller if the Biden admin had taken the surging inflation seriously at an earlier point; that less drastic rate hikes would have sufficed in that case.",Black_XistenZ,2025-03-13T13:41:27,1

"Firstly, ""the Biden admin"" does not and should not have any influence over monetary policy, i.e. interest rates. Threatening the independence of the central bank is the kind of shit tinpot wannabe dictators try to pull (e.g., Trump in both of his terms so far).  Secondly, I don't recall anyone claiming that no hikes would be needed. The earliest mention I could find of the term ""transitory"" by Fed officials is [this March 2021 speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20210317.pdf) by Powell, where in he merely says that inflation ""seems likely"" to be transitive. Nevertheless, they raised rates 25bps that very same meeting, and by 50bps the following one, and then by 75bps following that and in every month through November 2021.  He then goes on to reiterate the Fed's long-standing criteria, consistently communicated for years, for raising interest rates:  1. Labor market at full employment 2. Inflation at 2%, for more than just a single month 3. Inflation predicted to run above 2% for some time  Only the third one of these calls for any forecasting or guesswork by the Fed to begin with, the second  Neither one called for interest rate rises at that point: inflation had printed just above 2% for the first time that same month, March, following 1.85% in February, and the unemployment rate was down to 6.2%, which is decent, but not near full employment (it bottomed out at 3.4% in 2022 and is currently 4.1%).  So what exactly are you claiming the Fed should have done differently? There was no plausible basis in the data whatsoever to start raising rates earlier than March 2021. And surely you can't mean that they should have raised more aggressively that March -- instead of 0.25% -- after all, they raised 0.75% two months later, in May, and you seem to be calling that drastic. (That's laughable by the way, it was never drastic, it took a year and a half to reach the peak 5.5% rate which is close to the long-term historical average.)",bro_can_u_even_carve,2025-03-14T01:34:18,1

We are seeing that now, as Trump's diversions are crashing the economy.",No_Passion_9819,2025-03-11T12:39:28,6
