Donald will say he knows more about trade and investment than radical leftist globalist Warren Buffett,Imaginary-Wheel9207,2025-05-03T10:02:03,6

Warren Buffet is actually self made from childhood at 11 years old he began investing and while his family wasn't poor they were not incredibly wealthy either like Trump's were.  He has never had to file for bankruptcy personally.  Trump has no grounds to claim he is a better at understanding trade or markets like Buffet does.  Trump has less time in the market and less success since he has filed bankruptcy before.  ,arilupe,2025-05-03T11:57:23,2
"""Warren Buffet? Bozo Buffet, they call him. Bozo Buffet. What a bozo... I don't call him that, but I might... I might...  Bozo Buffet... He doesn't know anything about business... He's losing money every day. I know more about business than he does. He doesn't understand tariffs. Not a clue... So he shouldn't be saying anything. He should just stay in his cheap little house and not say a word. Bozo Buffet.  That's funny.""",whys-it-so-cold,2025-05-03T10:18:52,1
"It works when everybody else needs you far more than you need them and there are no alternatives for them. If this is not the case and there are equally powerful other global powers or blocks it does not work, particularly where they have alternatives available.   The sweeping tariffs have been an utter failure, and the coercive measures have not produced positive results.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-03T10:13:20,0
"I think trade can and should be used as a weapon, but only in very distinct cases of urgency.   For example:   - banning all trade with a country you’re currently warring. Like England in the early days  - banning trade with hostile nations that aim to destabilize your democracy with disinformation and corrupting your officials. Like Russia, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and maybe even China   - banning trade with hostile nations that invade allied countries. Like Russia.   The problem is that China has the most sophisticated industrial infrastructure and workforce.   And Saudi Arabia and Russia pay the bills of many republicans.",HumongousBelly,2025-05-03T10:20:34,0
