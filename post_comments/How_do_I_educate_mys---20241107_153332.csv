"You are awesome and brave for asking this!!! Depending on how little you know, maybe starting by researching the very basics of how American (assuming you’re American) legal system works… three branches, read the constitution, bill of rights, etc. and then learn how your state level government works and read its constitution and amendments as well. Then maybe google the most influential court decisions of all time and try to understand them - and ask yourself if you agree… really think about them. I think this will set you up to start understanding modern politics and agendas really fast from there :) good luck!",ImTheVoiceOfRaisin,2024-11-07T16:12:45,58

"I really, really love that you care. On behalf of a lot of us, thanks for the effort!  I will say, “the economy” is not an easy thing to understand. I have a masters in public administration. I’ve been following politics for 20 years. I’ve worked in local government and been elected to an office and I don’t understand “the economy” all the time. So if you don’t get it—it’s not all your fault! Honestly a lot of people don’t even know what they mean when they say “the economy.”   I really, really like the Crooked Media podcasts. They’re liberal, admittedly (the founders worked in the Obama administration) but they are incredibly knowledgeable. Even when they’re showing their partisanship, they’re honest (albeit sometimes exasperated) but they have a *ton* of experience and knowledge to back up what they’re saying. Pod Save America and Pod Save the World are the most informative, and I can’t say I’ve listened to every pod under their umbrella, but it’s a good place to start imo.   NPR in general is a great place to start too, for both news and podcasts about the news and current events. The Up First podcast is a great way to get a quick rundown every day in about 15 minutes.   In general though, “politics” is more than people think. It’s not just a broad concept of the national economy or abortion rights. It’s local road repairs. It’s public school budgets and curriculum. It’s tax rates where you live. It’s social security and Medicare and Medicaid and WIC and other safety nets. It’s the parks in your neighborhood and the sidewalks and bike lanes that take you there. Local and state elections are as important as national and I encourage you to learn about those too. If you look up your November ballot online you can find out who’s in charge where you live, and maybe attend a few meetings if you’re able. We desperately need young people in local government!   Don’t fret that you don’t get it all, or aren’t informed enough to cast a vote. I don’t suggest voting blind either, of course, but when the time comes again, you can research individual positions of individual candidates without having a full understanding of how the whole thing works! That’s how I learned a *lot* of what I have learned—simply reading policy positions on campaign websites and deciding who I agreed or disagreed with. Then I learned more as I went or researched issues that confused me. Some still do, and that’s okay too! You’ll never find a candidate you agree with 100% on every issue, and that’s no different than admitting you don’t “get” an issue.   At the end of the day, a random google about a thing you’re curious about is something! People say “don’t trust the government” but, .gov and .org sources tend to be the most reliable. If you use mainstream media sources, just cross check issues with other sources—a good viable source often cites sources to back up their claims anyway.",amandam603,2024-11-08T05:40:03,13

"Politics is boring a lot of the time.  You're still young but when an issue comes up that you really care about, that's when you'll start to pay attention.   Watching the world news is a good start.  I didn't know much either so I took political science as an elective.  I only really learned the technical bits that go into law making and policy writing.  Then I took international peace and conflict resolution.  It was a decent class but we didn't use current events.  You really have to find an aspect that interests you or is close to your beliefs and start there.  I don't think you're starting from nothing, you have an opinion, that's usually where political conversations end up.",LittleTricia,2024-11-07T19:09:59,6

"Don’t mind the people who might tell you you’re showing up late, everyone should celebrate you’re showing up at all because plenty of people go their whole lives never bothering, so good on you!   As many people here have suggested getting a basic overview of the government from Wiki or a Civics text book is a good place to start. From there you can really kind of chose your own rabbit holes. You can dive deeply into the nitty gritty of campaigns, how the SCOTUS has operated over its lifetime and how its decisions impact society. You can deep dive on influential presidents or even ones that might seem a little obscure.   One thing I would not recommend doing is turning to Podcasts that are specific to a more partisan agenda. I love Crooked Media’s content and they do a good job of recognizing their bias but it’s certainly going to steer you their direction and that’s not a bad thing but if you want to chose your own path as much as you can if stay away until youve formulated some opinions in your own.   Best of luck on your educational journey and please come back to ask more questions if you ever feel the desire to do so!",MTBadtoss,2024-11-08T15:06:12,3
"I'm a political consultant.   I recommend reading a book called Politics is for Power to everyone - it's short and easy to read.  Everyone should also figure out what's being passed, considered to pass, or not passed in their local governments, and figure out which side of that issue they land on. Then contact the people on that side and talk to them about it.",your_not_stubborn,2024-11-08T09:16:54,3
I put a lot of effort into being not biased when forming opinions and admitting when you get it wrong. I get it wrong. You will get it wrong. I do all the time. Humans get it wrong and we are biased by nature. Accept that.  I try to keep my stance on something and my observation on something separate. Your stance will always be biased or it isn’t a stance.  Accept that other people are smarter than you on certain topics as you are only human and can only be an expert on a small number of topics. Reading about something the internet does not make you an expert. If you are listening to someone who is going against the consensus. Then make sure they have the credentials to do that. Like they are an actual qualified expert.  Watch out for grifters who give off confidence like Jordan Peterson. He makes his sentences very attractive to listen to but he is no expert on the things that he talks about.,Derrpyderp,2024-11-08T10:07:43,3

The best way to understand Politics is that conservatives preserve the status quo with inaction or they attempt to revert progressive policies in the spirit of traditional family values. Progressives run on change platforms to advance the evolution of civil society which is why theyre at the fore of racial and woman issues ever since Civil rights movement. While theres a ton of propaganda explaining fiscal or governance differences the reality is that the party of Reaghan is long gone and both parties now stand behind governance structures that centralize the authority of the President and federal government. And both are fiscally irresponsible by either cutting revenues (tax) without cutting expenses (programs) or by funding more expenses above and beyond what revenues sustain. Everyone likes a free lunch.,rosecarter990,2024-11-08T05:51:30,1

"Start by reading an AP government textbook or something similar. If you really want to understand politics, you have to learn how the government works. That starts with reading and understanding the Constitution. Learn what powers a President has, what powers congress has, and what powers the courts have.  Most people are easily mislead over and over again by political propaganda because they do not know the basics of how our government works.  For example, Joe Biden promised to forgive student loans when he ran for president. A lot of people wanted to vote for him for this reason.   What they did not know was Presidents to not have the authority to cancel student loans. So when he passed an executive order trying to cancel the loans, people really relied on his statements, but I knew that the Courts would overturn his executive order with 100% certainty.   The next thing you should do is try to read about political campaigns of the past, like the 1960 Campaign for President between JFK and Nixon, or whatever past president interests you. The idea is to read political history. Historians tend to be much more objective about political events that happened in the past. This will give you a more accurate sense of what politicians real motivations are and what was happening behind the scenes. You can do this at the same time that you start reading daily news articles about todays politics, if you want. .   The difficulty in trying to learn about current politics is all the sources of information like politicians and news outlets and radio talk show hosts are always biased and frankly trying to deceive you. There goal is never to just give you the facts. They are always trying to influence what you believe. So the only way to truly keep track of current politics is to read both liberal news sites and conservative websites every day. Once you learn what both sides are saying about every issue, then you are in a better position to make up your own mind. This is crucial. Never just accept what the left or the right says about anything. Always make up your own mind on every topic",Jaredsince1981,2024-11-08T18:56:45,1

"Uff, I would say ""unbiased"" is very difficult to find, but good always to look for it. I would search the general terms in Wikipedia (capitalism, liberalism, conservatism, communism, socialism, nacionalismo, fascism, nazism, anarchism, authoritarian regime, democracy, etc)... You need to have the general concept of all this terms learn in a clean unbiased source, where these concepts were born and why or for what. And also read what you can about history of the 20th century as most of the current politics have a good base in those events. And most prejudices come also from all those conflicts.

"I stayed away from politics until I was in my late 30s (I knew the basics of government). I heard a few things that were going on in the world here and there but I really didn’t feel any of it made a difference in my life.   I believe around 2010–2012 I started hearing about terrorist attacks. So I turned on the news. Not just 1 channel. I flipped through every news channel. After listening to the issues and doing more research, I came to see that not all news channels report the entire story. I had to weed through the bias and bs and formed my own opinion.   Now I’m very in tune with politics. I follow pretty closely now that I know politics at every level affects mine and my loved ones’ lives.
