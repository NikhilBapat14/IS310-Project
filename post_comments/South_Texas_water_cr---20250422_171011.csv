"How many different ways will the Trump administration fuck this up?  No matter the number, they will blame Giner.",MangroveWarbler,2025-04-22T17:22:04,24
"[An excerpt from the full story:](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/south-texas/article/maria-elena-giner-resigns-trump-ibwc-20288297.php)  Maria-Elena Giner, the woman who has served as commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) for nearly four years, resigned Monday under pressure from the Trump administration.  Giner has been replaced by William “Chad” McIntosh, acting deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who, just last week, announced plans for a “reorganized EPA.”  In September 2021, President Joe Biden appointed Giner to lead the IBWC, the federal agency responsible for overseeing and enforcing the binational treaties between the U.S. and Mexico, including a 1944 treaty that governs water sharing along the Colorado River and Rio Grande watersheds.  But for decades, Mexico has dawdled on meeting those obligations, defaulting or coming close to defaulting on water deliveries in the previous three cycles.  And now the country is on the brink of defaulting on an unprecedented fourth cycle, which ends this October, after falling behind in its deliveries by more than 1.05 million acre-feet.  Mexico’s unreliable water deliveries, combined with persistent drought and long, hot summers led to a one-two punch that ultimately spelled the end for the Texas sugar industry.  Last February, the Valley’s sugar growers called it quits, directly blaming Mexico’s failed deliveries for the shutdown of their 51-year sugar farming legacy.  The death of that industry only served to underscore Giner’s advocacy on the water crisis and [spurred the first real movements of the diplomatic needle](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/us-mexico-water-treaty-south-texas-19907328.php) — most notably, the signing of a type of amendment to the water treaty known as a “minute” in November.  Giner described the amendment, known as Minute 331, as a “pilot minute” that would allow the two countries to test new solutions to the water crisis.  She was also instrumental in negotiating a delivery of non-treaty water from Mexico — a stopgap solution that offered limited help to Valley farmers but which nonetheless required some finagling from both federal and state officials to accomplish.

Replaced her with a guy...that calls himself Chad...when that's got nothing to do with his name.  Oh this is gonna go well.,PrinceSerdic,2025-04-22T17:29:19,3

The real problem nobody is seeing here is getting rid of women in leadership positions being replaced by weak men. This is happening in the military where female commanders are being fired for petty reasons and white males taking that post right away. One was fired for not having pictures of Trump in her office! ,Cleanbriefs,2025-04-23T00:09:54,3
Sounds like she was doing a great job. Even worked out test solutions for a contamination that has been going on over 100 years. So of course she was pressured to resign by team Trump,togocann49,2025-04-22T19:10:14,2
