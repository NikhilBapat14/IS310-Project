"So basically when Trump finishes his term he’s going to pardon every single person working for him in this government so that they cannot be prosecuted for ignoring SCOTUS rulings. The Constitution needs to be changed:  -1. Remove the President’s power to pardon and remove immunity from acts which undermine Congress or SCOTUS as they would contravene the oath taken by the President to uphold the Constitution.  -2. Make the US Marshals come under the authority of the SCOTUS to enforce its rulings, in effect it would have its own law enforcement agency that is independent of both the executive and legislative branches of government and takes precedence over the Justice Dept and the FBI.  -3. Remove emergency powers from the President that thereafter can only be granted through an act of Congress with a limited time frame as stipulated by the SCOTUS. If a clear and present danger exists to the United States in the form of an invading force or domestic upheaval with the aim of overthrowing the govt through such acts as terrorism the President can act accordingly as time is of the essence. However, to wage war on a foreign country Congress must give its consent or SCOTUS can grant an emergency reprieve as time allows with a view to seeking Congress consent asap. Failure to do so will automatically put the President on notice and be asked to rectify his stance if he refuses to follow protocol and could be removed from office by US Marshals.",Ok-Bar601,2025-05-09T07:26:07,24

Obviously, Noem was thoughtful in her explanation in her book about why she had to put down her 14-month old dog; the dog was killing the neighbor's chickens. Dogs who attack and kill livestock can and should be put down. It's actually expressly lawful in my state in Iowa Code Section 351.27. It's legal in South Dakota too.   Generally, the culture of my state is strongly in favor to put down animals who are aggressive towards people, livestock, or wildlife. I have a dog. I treat her like my family. But if she were to start killing my neighbors livestock, and I live on an acreage next to people with livestock, I would have to do the responsible thing to my neighbor because my neighbor is lawfully capable of doing that too. The neighbor could but might not hold me liable for damages if I do the right thing so they don't have to.

Talk to people you know that didn't vote. Volunteer for a day (at least) to get out and vote. Put signs on your property before a significant election. Call your local democratic office and ask what you can do. There is an abundance of information out there. But it requires you and others to seek it.

"No? No one would ever come to this conclusion.   Trump has been hanging out with criminals, Russian spies and American politicians his whole life. He bragged about buying them. Come on, the man has no shame or decency.   Some smart people are saying he pushed Ivana down the stairs, you know. ",coconutpiecrust,2025-05-09T11:44:05,3

And you're helping how? By taking the doom and gloom that the Admin is hoping to instill in you and spreading it for them? You're carrying their water and think you're being some enlightened realist.  Nobody has intervened in an attempted arrest by a deputy. Assuming that they will before it's even attempted is their propaganda speaking through you. Be responsible with your words.,bubbleguts365,2025-05-09T12:03:40,6
"I don't know how the courts will respond, but outright ignoring a judge's orders is probably the most terrifying thing that this administration has done (so far). If there are no consequences for blatant contempt, then the illusion of ""rule of law"" gives way to ""rule of arbitrary enforcement"". The will of the executive, which also happens to wield the enforcement arm of the law, would henceforth override the flaccid will of the courts.  Furthermore... consider that Trump's cabinet gets a good deal of their directional cues from Trump's social posts... in real-time. Do you remember the volatility of the markets when Trump started issuing policy edicts on Truth Social? Now imagine that same chaos and confusion applied to our justice system.
