"Now you’ll see all the Republicans who, for months, claimed Trump and his goons wouldn’t actually apply it (while simultaneously justifying every horrible aspect about it) openly boast about this project’s effectiveness.",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-04-29T17:17:09,6
"When fascists are consolidating their power and dismantling our democracy, you have to find out if you will accept the situation you're in. Either let that become the new normal, or do something.  If you fail to defend other people's rights - that is how you lose your own.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-29T17:21:08,6

"Trump is a master con-man.  He excels at getting people to believe about him what they want to believe about him.  Some thought he would cut costs.  Some thought he would create more jobs and better paying jobs.  Some thought he would cut their taxes.  Some thought he would cut government spending.  Some thought he would increase stock market profits.  Some thought he would make the U.S. into an oligarchy.  But he fooled all of them - he has done none of those things.  Cost of goods have gone up.  Many have lost their jobs and the jobs they can get pay less.  Tariffs are the largest increase in taxes on the poor in the history of the U.S.  Government spending has gone up.  The stock market has gone down.  And instead of an oligarchy, Trump is trying to form a dictatorship.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-29T17:56:06,4
