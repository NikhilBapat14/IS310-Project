"Data released Monday from the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) found “48% and 55%” of “left of center” people “at least somewhat justifying murder for Elon Musk and President Trump, respectively.” The findings come after a historically violent election season in 2024, which saw two assassination attempts on Trump in July and September.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-14T02:27:57,17

"This is why I have a hard time when people say online spaces are just filled with bots and people aren't so extreme in real life.  If it were just bots then polling would not reflect results like these.  The only thing preventing people from being the same in real life as they are online is that they don't enjoy anonymity in real life and would face consequences for their actions.  Problem is though that, if they persist in their paranoia and delusions, eventually these same people will decide that the consequences of inaction are more severe than the consequences of doing something.",Shadeylark,2025-04-14T08:07:22,12
Could you imagine what would happen to this nation if some left-wing fanatic did this and left-wing media pundits and politicians approved or celebrated? The repercussions could potentially be enormous and frightening!   I'd be hopeful that true Americans would essentially be happy with arresting those guilty of violence (and any members of conspiracies who assisted). I think that non-liberals in this nation would unite against the radical lawlessness that the far-left seems to always encourage.,chrismireya,2025-04-13T23:30:07,16

The party has moved far left, but there are still rational Democrats out there. My perspective is the most hateful Liberals are 30 and under, especially females. In fact, more men by a factor of 30% voted Republican than Democrat in 2024, the largest gap by sex in history.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-14T06:36:13,3
