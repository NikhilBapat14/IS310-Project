"This shit is so nauseating. The blueprint is simple:   1) accuse Trump of being a Nazi 2 conflate Trump’s supporters with being Nazis/sympathizers 3) use this cover as “proof” the left are the good guys, (because we’ve already established he’s a Nazi) 4) try to advance leftist legislation  My mind is just blown that it WORKS on so many.",HereIGoAgain99,2025-05-03T19:50:23,69

"There are Chilling parallels on the left in condoning (not denouncing) open violence against those who do not share the same political beliefs. Hatred towards Jews and subtly encouraging their extermination through thinly veiled hate speech, international violence and terrorism. Organizing Open protests to make anyone who disagrees with the anti Israel political agenda, feel fearful of speaking up against antisemitism and hate towards other races. Persecuting pro life activists and Ignoring violence against Christians overseas, beheadings, slaughters, borderline genocidal behavior. Labeling this all as anti colonialism and allowing violence to be excused as long as it is done to the white Christian community. With no accountability towards the perpetrators.   Any violence committed against ANY person or group needs to be PROSECUTED. Regardless of race, creed, religion or core belief. There should never be lenient “restorative justice” given to one side and full legal punishment and accountability applied to the other. ",Iamstillhere44,2025-05-03T19:26:44,17

"When the media claims that Trump is a Nazi, logically, they either don't believe it one bit, and are simply trying to influence the next election or, if they DO believe it, they are subtly trying to encourage a violent revolt without saying quiet part out loud.

"99.9% of people only look at what's in front of them if it spits on their face. I'm not surprised at all, you don't have to be dumb to be too busy, too tired or too inundated with propaganda to throw your hands up and walk away.

"The Nazis pulled and burned books so NO ONE could read them. That isn’t even close to being the same as pulling sexually explicit books from ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES  They didn’t ban them from being purchased or read in Florida, they just took them out of school libraries cause they were sexually explicit and not appropriate for kids  Stop buying their fear mongering, you’re smarter than that",Commercial_Hedgehog1,2025-05-04T13:01:55,4

I’m not trying to debate the merits of each book that was removed. Some were inappropriate in my eyes some weren’t. I’m just saying we can’t equate book burning with burning Tesla’s because they represent two very different things.
