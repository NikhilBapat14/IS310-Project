"Trump was raised by his father to believe that the world is comprised of killers and losers, and to never be a loser.  Trump has devoted much of his life to surrounding himself with sycophants.  And there was a time when he was a celebrity who had fluff pieces written about him, not a political figure with opponents and real-world challenges in the public view.  It isn't surprising that he is having a meltdown.  He is being a disappointment to his father, and he has few people in the real world who will be straight with him and tell him that he is screwing up.    Democrats need to change tactics.  Forget talking about how mean and tough he is, as that emboldens him and makes him feel like a killer as his father would want.  Instead, hammer on him being an incompetent, failed, weak loser.    He would break under the pressure.  Beneath the bluster is a kid with a massive inferiority complex, trying to use narcissism to suppress that self-doubt.",I405CA,2025-04-28T09:40:39,99

"Stop.  Being. Dismissive.  The people (regardless of how wrong or idiotic their positions are) are victims of the very systems you're trying to change.  These rural people are often from towns abandoned by industry and commerce when the wealth was extracted and left them with fucking nothing.  Used and abandoned like a $10 sex doll.  They're ignorant because they were literally never taught anything other than enough to be a productive laborer.  They saw promises of prosperity when they had the industry in their town at first; they saw infrastructure sprout up at the same time.  They were never told that this was done with assistance from the federal government; companies took all the credit and reward.  These people have been lied to about every good and bad thing that has ever happened to them.  They've often done what they were told (where viable) to achieve success and when they put in the effort they got shit on the moment the wealth was gone.  Yes, they're wrong.  But it's also not hard to see why they don't trust anyone who thinks, talks, and associates with the people who kept pulling the rug out from under them.

Being off by 16% is astronomically bad, especially for someone who had established a reputation of being the gold standard of understanding Iowan voters.  Trump has used this as an example of a ""election fraud"" so that he has some sort of basis to keep his supporters angry, because winning the election is the case of the dog finally catching the car he'd been chasing, so he needs something to keep up the fa√ßade of persecution and ""they are trying to steal my power"" bullshit alive.

"That's correct. The constitution sets the date for the president's term to end as Jan 20th at noon. If no president has been selected by that time, the speaker of the house takes over until one can be elected.   Trump may be ignoring the Constitution in many ways. But the question, should such an eventuality occur, is whether the military would follow it. On Jan 20th at noon, the new president - whether we recognize that to be someone elected, or of it's the speaker - becomes Commander in Chief. And the ex-president becomes a person attempting a coup. So the question becomes, does the military (or another agency) arrest the ex-president? Or do they decide that America as a constitutional democracy has ended and a new authoritarian regime has displaced it?",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-29T08:49:56,1
