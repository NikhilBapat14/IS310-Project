But that's not because anime is cheaper, it's because people enjoy it on a creative/aesthetic basis.  People aren't going to go to a movie theater instead of buying a box set just because the price goes up.  It's a fundamentally different kind of purchase. The solution would be something like Hollywood hiring Manga writers to write movies instead of commissioning scripts that have been focus-grouped to death.  Or optioning the rights to popular Manga.
