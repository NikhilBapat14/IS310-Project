Nice to see more movement toward basic income guarantees with no strings attached to funds.,tonyt4nv,2025-04-29T14:35:25,7
"Being homeless means being off the grid.  You might be able to vaguely count the homeless, but identifying them one by one is impossible. So....  how would a homeless person prove their homelessness in order to get the 1,000 per month (presumably it would soon be more) and I also assume many of the countless half-homeless would apply for the check too.  I wonder if the thousand is supposed to be in lieu of rent... like here's rent to keep a tent over your head since rents in CA are now over 1k almost everywhere.",fxkatt,2025-04-29T14:58:56,0
