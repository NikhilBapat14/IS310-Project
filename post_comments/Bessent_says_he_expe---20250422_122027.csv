The only way that happens is if Trump comes to his senses and withdraws all the unjustified tariffs he recently issued.    Why would China (or any other nation) be interested in making a new 'deal' with the US after Trump has proven they are an unreliable partner who cannot be trusted?,MJcorrieviewer,2025-04-22T12:27:07,10

Given China has said get bent a couple of times I wonder where this is coming from.  Is Trump going to back down first. Certainly not in character.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-22T12:25:10,7
"De-escalation, then re-escalation. Over and over again. Sometimes on the same day. Only problem is that us rubes don't get to play the market along with them because only they know the next moves and the right timing, and they are specifically trying to squeeze money out of us.",speckledlobster,2025-04-22T12:39:10,3
"Companies can't plan their business decisions with a mad king running around whiplashing everyone with on again/off again tariffs.  Countries won't make trade agreements in good faith with a partner they can't trust. They will make partnerships with other countries instead, which look more stable and predictable. That's China and Europe.  Trump needs to go or the US economy is going to crash. He has blown it. Can't be saved. Can't be recovered from.  Imagine it: Trump says ""OK guys forget all these tariffs, my bad. My mistake. Got bad advice, not going to do it.""  Imagine it because that's the only place you will see that. He cannot (narcissist) admit he made a massive mistake on the one thing he claimed to have expertise in: Business. So he will never back down, and if he does, nobody sane can trust that he won't climb back up some morning with new tariffs or something equally asinine.     HE NEEDS TO GO.",MagicianHeavy001,2025-04-22T12:52:04,3
