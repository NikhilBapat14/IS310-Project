"It’s the Christianity which does not say with Jesus, “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who abuse you.

They’ve been taught their entire lives that belief in something without evidence (what they call “faith”) is the way to eternal life and happiness.

"If I never hear the name Jesus followed by a screed of bullshit that is entirely against Christ again in my life, it would be too soon.

"Evangelicals love their sinners - certain sins anyway - because to be saved, you must have fallen. They truly believe this.
