"A Saudi oil baron was invited to a climate conference not too long ago. Orban has been dismantling Hungarian institutions for years now. Narendra Modi was persona non grata for his role in the 2002 Gujarat pogroms for years until he became prime minister, and now he's destroying mosques, censoring any form of dissent, and passing anti-Muslim policies across the board. England has been doing the same level of repression towards pro-Palestinian voices since Sunak's time as PM. El Salvador and the Philippines have greenlit extrajudicial arrests and killings for years. Every single one of our allies in the Middle East is committing horrific atrocities within and outside their borders between Israel's atrocities in Palestine, Saudi Arabia mistreating migrant workers and facilitating a genocide in Yemen, The UAE arming the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan and providing them with training as well as abusing migrant workers, Qatar and Kuwait abusing their migrant workers as well and the broad international community just lets them do it.  Democratic backsliding has been happening all over the world, Trump's second term is simply a continuation of that.",papibigdaddy,2025-04-29T03:34:03,12
