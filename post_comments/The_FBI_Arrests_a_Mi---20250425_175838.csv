It isn’t pure chaos.  That would have some outcomes that might o.k.  Mostly it is incompetent and cruel.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T18:12:49,5

"Let's review history for a minute:  ""Hitler determined to increase the political reliability of the courts. In 1933 he established special courts throughout Germany to try politically sensitive cases. Dissatisfied with the 'not guilty' verdicts rendered by the Supreme Court (*Reichsgericht*) in the [Reichstag Fire](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/11083/en) Trial, Hitler ordered the creation of the People's Court (*Volksgerichtshof*) in Berlin in 1934 to try treason and other important ""political cases."" Under [Roland Freisler](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/4230/en), the People's Court became part of the Nazi system of terror, condemning tens of thousands of people as ""Volk Vermin"" and thousands more to death for ""Volk Treason.""",williamgman,2025-04-25T19:18:53,3

"A NY Judge in 2020 blocked ICE from entering courtrooms:  “Judge Rakoff’s ruling emphasized that such arrests violated a longstanding common-law privilege that protects individuals from civil arrest while attending court proceedings or traveling to and from court. He concluded that ICE’s policy not only exceeded its statutory authority but also acted arbitrarily and capriciously, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The injunction prohibited ICE from making civil arrests on courthouse premises and of individuals required to attend court proceedings as parties or witnesses.”   The judge is not wrong and an administrative warrant is not a criminal warrant. An administrative warrant alone usually cannot be used to arrest someone inside without violating due process rules. In most states, administrative warrants are not treated like real court-approved warrants and aren’t enough on their own to arrest someone in courtrooms legally.",Quirky_Fly_5452,2025-04-27T03:48:15,1

"I’m sure they want to but I think they are (thankfully) running into more roadblocks than they initially expected. They will keep trying in new and hideously creative ways I’m sure but I think just on the available evidence they’re desperate to keep their momentum going because they’re already stymied.    Admittedly, that’s not the world’s most encouraging thought. “Oh man, the fascists are not succeeding to the level they expected thus far.”   And to even keep that true, we need to step up peaceful resistance even more.   But it’s the only hope I have right now. And maybe it can encourage you too.  Edit: missed a crucial word",Classic_Secretary460,2025-04-25T18:49:59,10
