60 days for congress to review.   Day 1: president issues tariffs  Day 45: congress says no  Day 46: president issues new tariffs  Repeat.,twirlingmypubes,2025-04-07T18:29:53,1

"""Under the bill, Congress has the ability to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval.""",Competitive_Travel16,2025-04-07T18:44:50,1
For this to pass it will need a veto proof majority which means if Trump tries that workaround then there likely would be the same supermajority to do something more permanent.,Ready_Nature,2025-04-07T20:03:27,1

"It will be interesting to see how this develops.  The power dynamics are interesting here. Obviously Trump is top dog but his coalition is shrinking both within Congress and electorally.  Money is the ultimate make it or break it issue. Losing Boomers and Wall Street Republicans is not a small deal, particularly in regard to 2026 and 2028.   In turn, the more extreme actions of this administration have to make some less devoted insiders with more years to live nervous about the possibility of Republicans losing power.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-07T18:44:02,1
"Unless they write something in that strips the president from issuing tariffs, there's nothing to stop another round of identical tariffs after the resolution. Round and round we go.  They need to completely pull the power from the executive branch.",twirlingmypubes,2025-04-07T18:50:09,1
"Sorry about my (now deleted) duplicate reply. I thought you were two different people.  Why would a resolution of disapproval not apply to identical tariffs? I think you might want the administration to try again, but with different numbers, under some circumstances like winding down the trade war we're already in.   In any case, if Congress does nothing, all tariffs expire after 60 days.",Competitive_Travel16,2025-04-07T19:32:16,1

"It would only apply to the tariffs they are signing a resolution about. The president will have the **valid** argument that a new identical tariff is exempt for the exact reason you stated -- *now* it may be more applicable than it was when the resolution was sent, whetheror not it is true. What can congress say? If they want to say ""no"", they will be forced to gather back up and sign another resolution. It'll be a never ending cycle and Trump has shown that he is childish enough to tie congress in knots over this.   The only answer is to completely strip him off this power  Edit: and the duplicate comment is cool. I thought we were both trying to make a point ðŸ˜„",twirlingmypubes,2025-04-07T19:42:46,1
"I bet if they manage a veto-proof majority and he tries to game it, then we would quickly get a stronger bill. Good question.",Competitive_Travel16,2025-04-07T20:21:46,1
