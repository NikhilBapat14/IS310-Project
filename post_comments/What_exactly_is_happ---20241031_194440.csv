">did trump overturn roe v wade?  He appointed the conservative judges who made the Supreme Court decision that has overturned Roe.   >I don't get to the extent of what she will be able to do  A president has limited power in this respect. She can appoint progressive justices when seats open up, which could eventually (like a decade or two) reinstate Roe if control of the court flips. If she is willing to take steps Biden would not, she could expand the court or bypass the filibuster to allow congress to legislate a federal abortion protection. She has made one vague comment suggesting she might be willing to do something like this where Biden was unwilling.   >In short, what will happen if either of these people get elected in terms of abortion?  In short, almost definitely nothing. If either president tries to immediately push for a federal law for or against abortion, they will be blocked by the filibuster in the senate. Republicans are unlikely to change filibuster rules because they face increasingly steep odds of keeping chamber control so the filibuster helps them more than it hurts them. Democrats under Harris might be willing to change rules, but Harris has a decent chance of coming into office without senate control this cycle, so it would take at least two years for democrats to gain control in midterm elections before they could push their agenda.   In long? Republicans means less access to abortion and Democrats means more access. How this plays out can vary, as I've explained, but those are the clearly stated aims of the party platforms and no matter what other tactics are tried, court control is always an issue and will always play out the same way. Democrat control means judges more likely to support abortion access and Republican control means more likely to restrict it.",fradleybox,2024-11-01T08:40:31,34

"*Roe v. Wade* was a 50 year-old Supreme Court decision that, along with some subsequent decisions, gave women nationwide the right to terminate their pregancies up until the point of fetal viability, which means until the fetus could conceivably survive outside the womb. That translated to around 24 weeks.  In 2016, when Trump was campaigning for President, he promised he would nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn *Roe v. Wade.* Publicly stating a legal litmus test for Supreme Court justices was highly unorthodox and frowned upon, because those judges are ostensibly just supposed to interpret the law, not come in with preconceived notions. But Trump did make that promise, and once elected, he fulfilled it.   As a result, anti-abortion groups made various attempts to get a case before the newly shifted court and they were eventually successful in getting *Roe v. Wade* overturned with the ""Dobbs"" decision, thereby leaving the terms of abortion rights to individual state governments, some of which have severely restricted those rights, or may in the future. Others have reaffirmed the rights.   So, presently, whether or not a woman has a right to an abortion, and the degree to which said right is restricted, depends entirely on which state she lives in, not what her doctor recommends.  Trump immediately took credit for overturning the national right to abortion and has continued to do so in the present campaign. He says leaving the determination to individual states' governments was the right one.  Kamala Harris, if elected, is unlikely to have an opportunity to appoint different justices in the next four years, because the conservatives currently on the bench are unlikely to vacate their seats during her presidency. What she has said, instead, is that if the Congress passes a bill to restore the protections under *Roe v. Wade* — a nationwide right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability — she would sign it into law. The chances of Congress passing such a bill are not high, however, because the legislature is pretty evenly split right now. It's likely Harris would take other measures to protect abortion rights where she can, though, such as in the military and by providing support for women who need to travel to other states to get such care.",nosecohn,2024-11-01T18:13:17,7

"Don't be fooled Roe V Wade was always a temporary measure. Was never a law and it was always going to be overturned if it ever went to the Supreme Court. Let me explain:  We are not a Democracy,  are a Constitutional Republic, what does that mean? It means that we can make laws and vote for or against anything as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution. Our founding fathers wanted it this way after having experienced tyranny at the hands of the British Monarchy.  Abortion has never been a constitutionally protected right. I am not saying abortion is good nor bad, I'll stay out of that debate only saying that its not constitutionally protected.  Since the Supreme Court can only rule on weather something is Constitutional or not they had to overturn it.   If you think Abortion should be protected by the constitution that an amendment needs to be added to the Constitution, and there are ways to do it.   If not then it goes back to the individual states (in this case) to allow or not allow abortion.  This also means that Trump cannot outlaw abortion if he wins, nor can Veep Harris overturn the Supreme Court rulling.   Both politicians are lying about what they are going to do about Abortion, but thats what politicians do.",Ok_Doughnut1685,2024-11-04T12:05:38,1
"Roe V Wade was overturned by the supreme court since it was unconstitutional. Now, states can decide how to progress on legality of abortion. If you're in California, you can still twerk-abort babies on stage, but now if you're in Texas, you can be hunted down and arrested for having an abortion.  Basically, it is a state decision on how to rule on it, which I think is very fair considering there are such populations groups for and against abortion. They should make it so states like Texas can't arrest Californians for having abortions in California, but by that logic, Texans should not be allowed to get abortions in California unless they move.  Ultimately this all works if the federal government restricts any state for imposing their laws on those of another state. Without that, this is highly unconstitutional. (i won't get into the morality of abortion, however, as that depends on the person).",TheMathKing84,2024-11-04T21:15:23,1
"I feel like the modern day pharisees have brainwashed America. On lots of things but it shows the most with abortion right now. Where in the bible does it say life starts at conception?? It doesn't. It says life starts in the womb which... duh. Historically people believed this occurred with quickening or baby kicks. Or now we also know that babies brains aren't developed until month 5 when they are able to experience feelings and start to become viable. Whereas the ""heartbeat"" fallacy is a lie because there is NO HEART at week 6.   Why do conservatives care? Voters care because they THINK they're being Christian. Im Christian and I follow my heart and my faith and I think this hides a big lie. The real reason the GOP cares is because 1) the birth rate is shrinking and the alternative to population growth is immigration which isn't desirable among white supremacists and 2) the traditional values mascarades the belief that women belong barefoot in the kitchen serving their husband's. The latter is also why GOP aims to decimate public education. And ironically taking women out of the workforce HURTS THE ECONOMY. But theres lots of contradictions here including the fact that:  Christ said love thy neighbor as thyself. Not ""unless you're straight"" and not ""America first"" and not ""only after you've made a homemade arsenal.""   Politics bring out the evil in people and the day that Reaghan turned Christianity into a strategy is the start to where we are now.  Trump has only taken this drive and exploited it.",rosecarter990,2024-11-05T20:34:03,1

"First off, you should always pay attention to what people do, not what they say.  I mean, of course Trump isn't going to accept responsibility for his policies or the policies of his party. He will deny having any affiliation or sympathies for Project 2025. He will also deny being a staunchly pro-choice candidate. He will also deny being a philanderer and a rapist, even though this came out in discovery during civil trials and is basically public knowledge at this point.  Trump is the reason Roe v Wade was overturned. There's not even a debate about that. And it is the GOP platform. It's also what the GOP base wants. And he is the GOP nominee.

"I think the term “pro abortion” has the optics of being for abortion as a good thing.   The term “pro choice” alludes to it being a choice made by the family and their medical provider without government interference.   I don’t think anyone actually thinks that performing an abortion itself is a good thing, but framing it in a way that speaks to leaving personal choices about your body and health up to individuals (aka the stakeholders most impacted) is a way to win people over who do not believe that abortion is a good thing but can agree that it’s beyond the control of a government.",Mamamama29010,2024-11-03T23:02:03,3

"By 8 weeks the baby has brain waves, by the 24-week mark the baby can feel pain, and will start kicking the belly at around 20 weeks. Does that now mean you condemn abortion after the 8-week mark or at any other one of these milestones? These are all glimpses of consciousness as the fetus responds and acclimates to its environment. I agree a fetus will not experience consciousness the same way you and I do, but they definitely exhibit acts of consciousness. For instance, a fetus in the womb during a third trimester will completely feel its body being ripped limb from limb in the fetus during late-term abortions. It will also struggle immensely and convulse during the procedure. What they instead lack is sentience, which again is not a suitable benchmark for human life considering brain-dead people are not sentient either, unless you think brain-dead people aren't human.   Furthermore, we can switch the hypothetical: A patient is brain dead instead of comatose, meaning clinically dead with no brain waves, alas we know the human will wake up in 9 months but this time with no recollection of anything, essentially starting their life anew. Can you morally defend the killing of that human in their brain-dead state with the understanding that they will subsequently return to normal brain wave activity in a pre-determined period of time? If your answer is it is not morally justifiable then you agree that brain waves and lived experience are not valid benchmarks for human life.  Definitially a human life is defined as ""**a human person and is the biological development of the species homo sapiens that begins when a human egg is fertilized by a human sperm and continues to develop as a living organism**.""

"I already said, unconscious/brain dead individuals already have a prior history/they have already formed memories that they could boot from, they have already formed a conscience before, so no, their not lesser...  If the cells have developed enough to become a fetus, then thats where I consider it a baby.  Though, Abortions not morally wrong, its a medical procedure to help women. Look at the problems Romania had when making Decree 770, Abortions were banned and alot of people couldn't take care of the children they had, crime rates increased as a result due to them being abandoned/facilities couldn't keep up & care for the amount of children they were receiving.  Its more morally wrong to not be able to have this medical procedure and be forced to have a child you cannot care for. Plus, the mother & child can both die during birth anyway or worse, the child is born and the mother dies, leaving the child motherless also. This could be a relative to you, a sister, a niece or friend that dies from birth. I think their life is more important, than forcing them to have a kid.

"Firstly, if someone with extreme dementia is unable to access their old memories, having no recollection of their past life, are they sub-human. No.    Second, you are misinformed, ""fetus"" does not describe a level of development, it is merely a synonym for offspring or baby and used when said baby is in utero. A fetus is created at conception, therefore you believe that a fetus is always a viable human life at the immediate point of conception. Thank you for agreeing with me.   Lastly, since we both agree that conception is the benchmark for human life, we both then by extension agree that every fetus is granted human rights, as it is a human life. No mother or doctor has a say in whether that individual baby lives or dies. That is one of the most basic tenets of any justice system in the world.   Abortion in second and third-world countries are more complex scenario, but if we are looking at strictly at abortions in first-world countries like the United States for example, there are many many resources available that will ensure the life of the child without the burden of parenthood. Furthermore, no sensible  pro-life activist will put the baby's life over the mother's life, in circumstances where the mother cannot carry a baby to term an abortion will be legally necessary. However, these are very small exceptions.",Total-Relationship77,2024-11-24T20:18:16,1

"Okay, I said unconscious/brain dead/dementia, (anyone that falls under that category), are people still, because they have lived a life and still have memories/had the abiliy to have a consciousness make memories & thoughts etc, (compared to Zygotes, which **cannot** do any of **that**) I didnt disagree with that any of that.  Prior comnent you were mentioning how its even ""murder"" to abort a Zygote, their weeks in development  are vastly different compared a fetuses development   ""An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, which is the 9th week of development after fertilization of the egg. A zygote is a single-celled organism resulting from a fertilized egg. The zygote divides to become a ball of cells that eventually implants in the wall of the uterus.""    Zygotes form at 3 weeks and are still a clump of cells, with no conscious comparable to a dementia patient/comatosed person, so I think its a bit radical to call zygotes a human being when they literally cant form memories, organs, hands or bones yet. So;    Embyro/fetus: has developed hands and nearly all organs.  vs  Zygote: Is a clump of cells, no features/organs, is still dividing.  __________________ or  __________________ Dementia patient:A real human being, Has prior memories and experiences  vs  Zygote: Is a clump of cells, has not developed any organs, **impossible to develope or have the ability to make thoughts/memories at cellular stage.**     Thats what im getting at, you simply cannot compare the two.    Also, its still not economically good, feasible, realistic or sustainable to have all of these unwanted children, it takes a toll on the system if abortion is banned, crime rates will still increase anyway if there is any sort of ban on it.    Its not helping anyone. Its more ethical to let woman decide what they want to do with it, its literally their uterus.  They can be donated (and are) for stem cell research anyway, to develope  new medications to treat autoimmune diseases/forensics/skin growth for burns, anything to help people currently here.  Its not economically fair to have a child just now, its just to expensive.
