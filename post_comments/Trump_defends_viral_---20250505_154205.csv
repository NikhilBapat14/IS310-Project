I’m a Catholic. I and many other Catholics absolutely did not fucking love it. We fucking lost it ,MidnightTrain7,2025-05-05T15:52:16,19

">“You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media ... the Catholics loved it.”  The fuck we do. Even Vance had a hard time pushing out the, ""It's a joke, bro,"" message. He tried. But it wasn't his best effort.   I, so, hope this pushes GOP leaning ""American Catholics"" (TM) to schism from the Vatican. Those so-called Catholics are anything but Roman Catholics. Go on. Schism and make Trump the head of your church. Go full blown Henry VIII. Take your ""Prosperity Jesus"" and just leave the rest of us, Roman Catholics, alone already.",inksmudgedhands,2025-05-05T15:51:06,10

So he doesn’t have to approve what his team posts “for” him? They have complete control and the orange diarrhea man has no say in it?  Sure. Sounds right,beadzy,2025-05-05T17:43:46,1

He did but this isn't the first time Trump post something on his social media platform and tries to lie about what he did/didn't do,randomnighmare,2025-05-05T15:50:21,5

I'm a reformed Catholic and it pissed me off.    I'm driving today and NPR has a story on about a comedy club in Syria post Assad.  Comedy has been thriving there in the last few months but they will not joke about religion.  I wonder why...  Maybe Trump will be cocky enough to step up his just kidding game to other religions.,bm1949,2025-05-05T17:38:34,4

"Back when I was really Catholic, I probably would've been offended by it but now I'm just rolling my eyes because that dude is so desperate for attention at all times. Plus every time weird stuff like this happens and everyone starts talking about it, it's usually a distraction from the more serious stuff his administration is doing.",emslynn,2025-05-05T19:20:36,2
