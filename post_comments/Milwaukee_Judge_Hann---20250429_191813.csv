LOL she's toast.  Cut and dried case of obstructing federal immigration agents.  Bye Felicia.,BestSeattle,2025-04-29T19:39:54,316

Something something about not doing the crime......,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-29T19:40:15,39
Hopefully we can permanently relieve her of these duties,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-04-29T20:13:32,37
Not a great loss‚Ä¶.and to be honest until I seen this post‚Ä¶.i had forgotten her anyway..  Not quite the ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù status she was looking for I bet üòÇ,tsoxiko,2025-04-29T21:16:14,12

"First r/politics was moaning about how the ""Gestapos"" arrested her for absolutely no reason at all.   I suppose now they're going to have to label the 4-3 Liberal majority Wisconsin Supreme Court as a bunch of ""Nazis"".",MildlyBemused,2025-04-30T03:06:10,96
Don't worry. Liberals will turn her into a martyr even tho a liberal majority court did this. Bc they have to take the 20% position. And they love to defend criminals,MoisterOyster19,2025-04-30T04:30:54,42
"One would think, but in today's world I have my doubts.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-04-29T19:41:13,94
You forgot jail her. She obstructed federal officers and harbored a criminal.  Both are felony charges.  This needs to be set as an example.  If she walks away with simply losing her job then it proves judges are above the law.,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-30T00:01:15,51
"Unfortunately in all my years of voting in Milwaukee I can only recall one or two times that an election for circuit court judge was even contested. Most judges run unopposed and get rubber stamped in, so there's really no guarantee that public sentiment would replace her with anyone better.",Awkward-Ad-4911,2025-04-30T07:22:07,3
"I don't think a grand jury will even indict her. A single progressive activist on the jury means they will automatically acquit her because their brains don't function in terms of legal vs illegal, they function in terms of moralistic grandstanding that aligns with their own worldview regardless of what is legal.",TheSleepyTruth,2025-04-29T20:13:40,80
If she even dares to run again after this.,ITrCool,2025-04-30T07:39:18,1
Under the federal rules the grand jury indictment doesn't have to be unanimous. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule\_6](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6),49thbotdivision,2025-04-29T23:35:28,41

"I'm not saying she would run again, but whoever runs in her place is likely going to run unopposed. I did find this article from her last election season:¬†https://www.mkebar.org/index.php?option=com_dailyplanetblog&view=entry&year=2022&month=03&day=22&id=25:get-to-know-your-2022-judicial-candidates-   Note the poll from the Milwaukee Bar Association. She was clearly voted as the least qualified Judge candidate.",Awkward-Ad-4911,2025-04-30T07:44:11,2
