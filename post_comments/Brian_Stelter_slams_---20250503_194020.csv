Very rich of the media to complain about Trump when they're half the reason he is where he is because the media refused to hold him accountable for everything/anything.  This post logical world is a most fascinating place,Shadowtirs,2025-05-04T03:18:49,3

Sesame Street has made fun of trump for years and years. They have greedy evil puppet that is clearly Donald trump.  He hates the whole company with a passion.  And of course he’s morally corrupt so he thinks being president allows him a chance to get revenge ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-03T23:20:05,8
