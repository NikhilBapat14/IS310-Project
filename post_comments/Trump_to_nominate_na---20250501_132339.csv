Is  UN ambassador the new out to pasture?,Riftreaper,2025-05-01T13:28:48,13
Does this not require a senate approval? Just going to string along the toxicity of his incompetence,gamerme,2025-05-01T13:28:44,10
The UN ambassador is a pretty weak position though compared to NSA. It is not a statutory member of the security council and their task is to just repeat what the State Department and President says.   He won't have contact that often with the President anymore and won't be dispatched really anywhere. His job will be to remain in NYC and hold side talks that are not where the true diplomatic break throughs happen.   Witkoff is showing that real deals and scheming happens behind closed doors. So it is a downgrade. The UN Ambassador of every country just makes statements at the UN. Btw as it stands the US does not respect the UN and Trump spends half his time bashing it and saying he should pull out of it. The GOP is usually on board with his anti UN statements.,Doctorstrange223,2025-05-01T13:28:56,4
