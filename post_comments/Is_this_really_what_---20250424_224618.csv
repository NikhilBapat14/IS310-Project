"""They've needed flagpoles for 200 years.""  Not counting the 75-foot flagpole and the iconic one on top of the White House.  Has there been anyone ever that lies and lies and lies like this guy?",YallerDawg,2025-04-25T06:56:35,5

"You know... there are weather events in DC. The soil is mostly clay which is a contributing factor to trees falling on vehicles using the GW Parkway and the BW as well.  Guessing there isn't any geologist consult to determine how far to dig or how tall a pole can safely be installed.   Probably not discussed with a meteoroligst as to wind sheer and direction to calculate falling pole trajectory in such an event.  Using the lowest bidder to do the install is always the *best* as he claims.   I'm imagining at dine point,  a cartoonlike highlight segment on the news showing that pole snap up out of the ground, tip and cut the house in half like a knife through butter.   You do you.",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-25T06:03:42,3
