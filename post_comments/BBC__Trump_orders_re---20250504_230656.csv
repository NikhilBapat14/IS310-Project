"Is this for real!?   Alcatraz didn't close because of it's reputation, but because of it's condition!  The salt water has rotted the walls.  FFS three guys tunneled out using a fingernail clipper!  ONE CLIPPER!  They passed it back and forth!  ðŸ˜†  Can I curse in here because this fucking idiot is an insult to fucking idiots.  The one thing I like about it him is the fact that no matter how many stupid things I do, which is A LOT of stupid things, I'm still smarter than him!  So long as there is Trump I will never be the bottom of the barrel!  Reopen Alcatraz!  What's next, relaunch the Titanic!?  Yeah, put some duct tape on there; she'll be good as new!  Sorry for freaking  out, but sometimes it just gets to be too much.",tinyE1138,2025-05-05T07:37:04,13

Perfect. It will re-open in January 2029. Just in time to house it's most notorious criminal.,Patient_Reach439,2025-05-05T09:36:16,6
Would be beautiful irony if Trump reopens it and is eventually sentenced to do time there.,Sea_Feed382,2025-05-05T08:19:28,5
Itâ€™s about silly optics not practicality. Itâ€™s notorious and he wants to focus on the worst criminals he can find and pretend they represent a far greater number than they do,Bakingsquared80,2025-05-05T06:29:02,4

"The only funny part is he also wants to expand the prison. As most things even though heâ€™s been to a certain island a bunch, apparently he doesnâ€™t know how islands work. Canâ€™t really make an island bigger donny!",Tricky-Spread189,2025-05-05T07:40:44,3
Eastwood's film Escape from Alcatraz was broadcast in Palm Beach Florida TV the evening he posted about this on social meedia. I dont think that this is a coincidecne.,CBR85,2025-05-05T14:17:21,3
You can only put a couple hundred people there. It's small. He wants to imprison 100's of thousands.,Assine1,2025-05-05T04:59:26,2
"Of course, only Congress could do this, because the $$$ for it would have to be appropriated.  Another shiny object that the media is focusing on, while his thugocracy rips down our society.",daveashaw,2025-05-05T08:55:05,2
"Hopefully, someone in his administration will tell him what a colossal money put that would be.   And still manage to convince him to not do it.",TableAvailable,2025-05-05T09:33:41,2

It would cost a bajillion dollars to get Alcatraz into anything ok enough to hold prisoners. It's falling apart and hasn't been habitable for many many decades. Cheeto Hitler has been staying up late watching old movies again.Â    This would be hilarious if it wasn't so insane. They're all insane. And stupid as fuck.,Chigrrl1098,2025-05-05T14:49:26,2

"Sorry, you are actually required to curse here. So, it's ok.   I keep wavering back and forth as to why he is such a fucking dumbass and suggesting this. Is it his obsession with 80s/90s action movies and he recently saw one? Or is it his irrational fear of sharks?",this-is-all-nonsense,2025-05-05T08:48:06,3

Not for some of us. He's a moron but I saw the Khmer Rouge up close and personal. He believes his own stupid and has enough like minded fools that he disappeared US citizens. This is really happening.,statmonkey2360,2025-05-04T23:37:58,6

"He is stuck in the past. Alcatraz was a big deal in the 1960s and 70s. He likely read a book in the 1970s about McKinley and tariffs that stuck with him, so he has missed the last 50 years of trade dynamics.",Lonely_Impression142,2025-05-05T09:12:25,5
