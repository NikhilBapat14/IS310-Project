"Mormons are politically conservative but Trump-skeptical for a number of reasons. The biggest are that it's a demographic that highly prizes education, so they tend to be more college-educated than Republicans as a whole. And they're more friendly towards immigrants than the average Republican, probably in part because [most men and some women in the church serve missions that are mostly overseas](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/722339)--they have real contact and relationships with the populations being demonized.   Basically, the Mormon demographics make them similar to the white college-educated suburban bracket that's been shifting left since Trump. The shift has been driven by large numbers of younger voters shifting hard to the left, [with almost 50% of younger Mormons choosing Biden in 2020](https://religionnews.com/2021/04/01/younger-u-s-mormons-voted-for-biden-but-trump-performed-well-overall/). As the older, more conservative LDS church members die off and younger ones keep swinging to the left, it's entirely possible that in 15 or 20 years, they will be a Dem-leaning demographic.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-08T10:44:37,5
"As much as i love Trump, he does a lot of things many christians would take offense to, which can be a turn-off for their votes.",ILoveMaiV,2024-11-09T10:59:50,1
"It's also possible that Trump's economic policies are less appealing  and the bogeyman of socialism is less scary to Mormons. Mormons essentially pay a 10% flat income tax to the LDS church through tithing. They also voluntarily give up some potential income during their mission period. In turn, the church administers somewhat of a welfare state. Historically, Mormons have experimented with non-capitalist systems.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-08T22:56:21,2
