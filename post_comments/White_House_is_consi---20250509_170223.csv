This is not a good idea. And I really doubt the courts will allow it. If it’s too hard to deport alter the laws or appoint more immigration judges. We dont need to stomp on liberties that define this nation to do what honestly is a routine process.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-10T00:03:47,228

There is a necessary constitutional debate on how it can be legal to let people in (illegally) and then require excessive legal expense to remove them.   Technically they should invalidate the programs that shipped people in and use that to remove them.   It's a mess no matter what.,DRKMSTR,2025-05-09T21:29:34,68
