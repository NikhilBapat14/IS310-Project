It’s not even economic analysis, it’s economic astrology with a MAGA twist. Imagine walking into a burning building with a flamethrower, then blaming the smoke on the guy who brought a water hose. Trump wants to inherit credit like a trust fund but ditch blame like an overdue loan. Classic narcissist economics: heads he wins, tails you cheated.  This isn’t leadership.

"220614_Trump-is-a-child.txt  Back when he was campaigning, several people observed that he spoke ""at a fourth grade level."" They meant that his vocabulary was tailored to an audience with a low education, but I thought they didn't really get the significance.  Trump *literally* spoke like a child.  ""When I'm president, you will have to do what I say!""  ""When I'm president, I will get *two* scoops of ice cream, and you will only get one!""  ""When I'm president, if you say mean things to me I'll just say 'Get him out of here', and the police will come and drag you away!""  His words and ideas are a child's vision of power. This is by his own admission, in a way:  [quote] >Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself.
