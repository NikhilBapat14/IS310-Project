"""Economists expect the aggressive trade policy to result in a wave of job losses. The tariffs, expected to be a drag on domestic demand, are already prompting some companies to reduce staff. United Parcel Service said on Tuesday it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as part of a planned reduction in deliveries for Amazon.com.""  The true impact of the tarrif war is incoming, and a recession like we have never experienced before is looming.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-01T08:01:47,10
I think a lot of us have been expecting this and thought it would show sooner and worse.  Obviously we’re over the lip now.,KidKilobyte,2025-05-01T08:10:10,4

"My previous employer has a federal government contract, and saw the opportunity for more contracts in the void of the federal cybersecurity force having been nearly completely gutted.  So they laid off nearly all of their black, brown, women, and LGBT employees to make themselves look more appealing for federal government contract bidding, making ~20% of their workforce unemployed within a few months of Trump being elected.  Yeah, actions like that tend to create more jobless claims. Before the chuds out there see this as a win for white power- they’re not refilling these roles with white men.  The industry by and large is entering a cascading hiring freeze, and I’m sure other industries impacted by the direct action of knowingly negligent social and economic policies are following suit.",[deleted],2025-05-01T09:18:29,2

"\>More like....planned.  I try not to be too conspiracy minded, but I can't help but wonder if they thought there would be more protests and civil unrest by now. Yes we've had protests, but overall I feel like many people on the left are in a ""ok, fine, we're all in the same boat. Let it fucking sink"" mentality and they planned on a bigger movement to crush and make a big show of it. Trump winning didn't cause a riot, DOGE didn't start a riot, ICE didn't start a riot. They got all these new EOs letting cops be represented for free for wrong doing, ICE can enter homes without warrants, citizens can be deported, and we're funneling military hardware to local police. And no matter what they do they're no riot to crush with it yet. So how do you start a riot? Fucking starve us.",LocalEquivalent52,2025-05-01T12:31:24,1

Fucking starve us.  Well yeah I think that mindset goes along with the situation. The average American is a little-Hitler who only cares about politics when they think it’s making them poor. So, just let Trump fuck everything up for a bit so people feel like he’s making them poor.",AJDx14,2025-05-01T12:58:04,2
"Remember the last Trump administration when his mismanagement of covid tipped this country over into a depression, and it took all the efforts of the democrats to right the ship.   His second term is going to make that one look like fun.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-01T08:38:39,2
"Yes, that is the definition of a recession. We are now one month into the second quarter of the Trump recession. Do you think the economy is growing? It is not, the shrinking is accelerating as the headline of this article suggests.  Saying “we are in a recession” is a predictive statement. Not a very bold prediction, though.",nasalevelstuff,2025-05-01T18:36:55,2
"Sweetheart, 2020 wasn’t anywhere near a depression. And last time, Trump actually helped out average Americans who were out of work. This time it’ll be orders of magnitude worse. It’ll be a second Great Depression, and this time he won’t be helping out us little guys.     Fun and completely unrelated Fact: I took Econ 101 and 102 in like 2013. The instructor was a typical supply side, anti-federal reserve kind of guy. He once said, “We never had a depression until after the Federal Reserve was created.” The truth is that we had a boom and bust cycle in the late 1800s, which is what prompted the creation of the Federal Reserve. He didn’t believe me. So then I replied with, “If we’ve only ever had one depression, then why is it called the GREAT Depression?” To his credit, he said, “Hunh“ and did some research and later admitted he was wrong. But this was a guy with an Econ degree teaching Econ at a community college, and he didn’t know basic American economic history.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-05-01T10:54:02,0
