"I mean, the equity is about providing more broadband to Americans. It has nothing to do with race, especially since a bunch of it is for RURAL Internet access which is mostly white people.   As to the analogy I like the analogy: imagine you are running a marathon. Your legs and arms are shackled together with heavy chains, and occasionally someone from the sidelines hits you in the face with a stick. No one else in the marathon is tied up or hit.  Then part way through the race they take the chains off. Everyone says ""well now you are equal!"" People still get to hit you in the face with sticks, and you are MILES behind the other people in the race. When you try to complain, people hit you with bigger sticks.   Later, they make a new rule that people aren't allowed to hit you with sticks anymore. People complain, even say that hitting you with sticks HELPS you! It encouraged you to run faster! Yes, you are black and blue with bruises, and you have a fracture in one of your legs which never healed right. In fact, during the fight just to GET the No Hitting With Sticks, a bunch of them showed up and stopped you so they could beat you EXTRA hard. But now there's a No Sticks Rule, you still have a fracture, you are bleeding, and you are told that you are now on a totally even, fair marathon.  And then, miles and miles later, you find out that this whole time, the other people in the marathon were taking breaks. They got water and food. You never even were TOLD there were rest stops, because by the time you got there, all those benefits were gone. Or worse, when they took the chains off, or made the No Sticks Rule, they also secretly made a rule getting rid of those rest stops. They even set fire to them, making sure nobody could ever use them, JUST to make sure YOU couldn't use them, too.  And now, people are finishing the marathon. You are so far behind that the first people who finished the marathon aren't even aware there are still people running. They showered and are attending parties, oblivious to the fact that you're not even halfway through it. Some of them are denying a marathon ever existed, in fact.",Qubeye,2025-05-09T15:35:26,1

Those conservatives we're talking about are still living in a culture built by the Confederates and their ancestors. Their culture has taught them that it's virtuous to lie about the atrocities they've built their lives on, and honorable to kill and die over their lies. It is the foundation of their national and personal identities.  Lying about having stepped on the black kid's head to climb the fence is an honorable, respectable, and required part of participating in civil society for them.

What does happen if you're out there in the sticks and want fiber rolled in, is they bill you. The landowner pays the cost.

Rural subsidies in some places might keep the cost per month down after an installation to $50 a month, if they're lucky, but usually not (and that all expired last year anyway, if I recall). If you want service somewhere where the ISP didn't judge you worth spending the money to install the infrastructure to begin with, you pay the tens of thousands for the fiber rollout and the pole installs and everything else.

That's exactly how it works down here in NZ. BUT... you have multiple ISP's competeing on the same fibre. So swapping from one isp to another is a quick call and nobody comes to your house. The switch is done at the exchange.,Outback_Fan,2025-05-09T16:59:02,1

"SF internet situation is actually very unevenly distributed. The city deliberately disobeys state law on fiber micro-trenching, and trolleybus power lines can impede some work in neighborhoods with overhead wires. For the unlucky who cannot get fiber, this means - you guessed it - Xfinity, which has only updated half of the city with mid-split.  Meanwhile, my grandma in Colorado has 10 gig fiber.  I am of course very thankful that I don’t have to use AT&T DSL. That would be a true nightmare.  Anyway, my point is that the rural neighborhoods are somehow getting a better product because there is less bureaucracy in the buildout, but it’s sad that it is likely to be torpedoed by Trump.",zten,2025-05-09T16:52:09,1

"> It’s not affordable, we’ve spent hundreds of billions and these assholes are working to charge even more for the lines we paid for, and the service we pay for monthly to use.  you also have to pay for the electricity that runs through wires that ""you paid for"", or the water that goes through the pipes that ""you paid for"".  ""you"" didn't actually ""pay for"" all of it anyway - these are subsidy deals where the winning bidder has to put up a substantial percentage of the investment. these subsidies don't cover operating expenses.  > I’ve used starlink, it works great and there’s no need to bury a trillion dollars worth of fiber for it and it costs the same as any other high speed isp.  this is like saying ""we don't need to build out the power grid, just give them solar panels"". starlink has none of the capacity or the upgrade path that fibre has, the satellites need constant replacement, and the equipment is power hungry and expensive.   anyway, you'll get the worst of both worlds with trump as his FCC is doing all it can to give Musk tons of subsidies for that objectively inferior service",bbbbbbbbbblah,2025-05-09T16:01:34,15
