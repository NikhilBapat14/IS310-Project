"In other articles, it appears Elon allowed Russian access. Guess if true, their payment for helping Trump stay out of jail.   ""The most eye-popping element of the allegations is that the Russian IPs were somehow connected to the actions of DOGE employees.

"The perks and reduction in various government investigations Elon got from his love affair with the orange turd is amazing!   But this is very suspicious.

Correct. They popped a hole in the firewall for whatever port they were trying to allow in but they forgot to disable the geo IP ACL’s that prevent specific external subnets from accessing the network. There are two types of incompetencies here:  1. The DOGE kids obviously do not have experience configuring complex firewall rules because they thought a simple port forward would allow Russia to connect.   2. The Russians didn’t try to change their origin IP by using something as simple as a VPN that terminates state side and would have let them connect.  It’s nice to know that our adversaries both near and far are not the brightest bulbs.,UltraSPARC,2025-04-25T07:39:23,10
"DOGE dorks probably just asked AI.  As for Russia, there is a chance, if this is true, that they want it to be known.  Here is the issue--is Russia breaking a law here?  It's not like they hacked in, they were let in by DOGE employees.  If any of this is true, it falls onto Trump, which Russia can use to hold over his head as a bargaining chip.",crucial_geek,2025-04-25T11:55:23,3
