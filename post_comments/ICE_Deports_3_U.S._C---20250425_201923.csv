">CE detained the first family on Tuesday, April 22, and the second family on Thursday, April 24. In both cases, ICE held the families incommunicado, refusing or failing to respond to multiple attempts by attorneys and family members to contact them. In one instance, a mother was granted less than one minute on the phone before the call was abruptly terminated when her spouse tried to provide legal counsel’s phone number.  >As a result, the families were completely isolated during critical moments when decisions were being made about the welfare of their minor children. This included decisions with serious implications for the health, safety, and legal rights of the children involved–without any opportunity to coordinate with caretakers or consult with legal representatives.

"Absolutely baffling that many on the right support this regime, and yet still claim to be followers of Christ.  ""He asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”  In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’  “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”  The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”  Jesus told him, ""Go and do likewise.""

"Yes! Conspiracies definitely should be prosecuted.   In my humble laymen's interpretation of federal law, the law as written anyway, this would be a ""Conspiracy to Deprive Rights Under Color of Law"" with steps taken, including but not limited to, a previous statement declaring their prior intent to disobey Court Orders, the Deprivation of Due Process Under Color of Law, Subjection to Cruel and Unusual Punishment Under Color of Law, Warrantless Seizure Under Color of Law, Deprivation of Right to Council Under Color of Law.  ICE is alledgedly backing down on criminalizing the 1st Amendment against college students, but I wouldn't put it past them to ""get rid of them"" through some other means, namely, Unreasonable Search leading to prosecution with the initialization of said search being hidden from them in a massive Brady Violation, a planned Deprivation of Due Process.  That said, it took forty court cases being lost by ICE for them to get the hint, and Trump has claimed that he has no knowledge of the Supreme Court's 9-0 decision involving Garcia, despite a lower court being informed, under oath mind you, that Trumo was aware and speaking with the President of El Salvadore about his release. Granted, Xinis informed the DOJ that the statement was meaningless because the conversation was not presented before the Court, and to her knowledge, there have been zero attempts at facilitating the return of Abrego Garcia.  Now, as long as we can get a single Contempt of Court charge linked to Donald Trump in any meaningful way, we can get him on Conspiracy Charges.  There's a saying: If the President does it, then it's legal. I heavily disagree. He is a government official, and he can order the Deprivation of Rights, and when he does so, he colors it with the law. He has previously tried to site the Constitution of the United States to Deprive Citizens of their 14th Amendment Right to Citizenship, sadly, it's only blocked on a temporary basis.  The courts seem to be slowly catching on that they have granted him far too much power; the Supreme Court seems to be taking even longer with it. Democrats in Congress may be realizing that they have ceded too much of their power to the executive branch, granting Trump the platform to attempt this shit in the first place.  I, as a potential juror, forced to interpret the law as written, and quite frankly, I disagree with the Supreme Court's contested OPINION that the President has Absolute Immunity for Core Constitutional Powers, should he cover up actions by the military that would constitute murder, he is an Accessory After the Fact, should he Order it in the First Place, he is an Accomplice to Murder. He can give unlawful orders, and those orders by their nature are illegal, often felonious from a federal standard. He can through direct action, or, derelection of duty, be guilty of Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law; it is his sworn duty to ensure that every Citizen of the United States, and the people subject to her jurisdiction are Granted their Constitutional Rights. He is subject to the same laws any person would be, and because of the fact that he is the Ultimate Power upon the Enforcement of the Law, he is subjected to the law at a higher standard.  As a juror, utilizing just the publicly available information that has been on the news, I would vote to break tradition and indict a sitting president.   Vote out Congress until we can get Representatives, people who actually care about the betterment of their Constituents. People who will impeach him, and allow us to take his case to a Grand Jury.  I will granted you that felonies committed Under Color of Law hold a special place in my heart, due to the likelyhood of it failing from actions of Law Enforcement that were perpetraited Under Color of Law, but that doesn't mean the boot don't fit.   Donald Trump, and specifically his regime, are criminal in their actions, often bordering treasonous; actions that Donald Trump has most certainly ordered himself.  Trump himself should have been charged with treason when he insigated a seditious act, calling forth a personal militia to use forth against the government in violation of the Constitution of the United States.  He has the proclivity to commit these crimes.  He has previously stated willful intent.  He has taken direct action by signing those executive orders, in front of witnesses, mind you.  This regime, seems like it's attempting to spark a Civil War, with the actions they're taking, and their plans to follow.  There's a reason Trump doesn't trust the FBI agents that were investigating him, and it's because they looked for facts, and he personally doesn't believe that those facts make him look innocent.  There's a reason Patel doesn't trust the FBI to run his security, and it's not because they are incompetent. God knows those men and women are extremely good at their jobs.  TLDR: They should definitely be charged with conspiracy.",BananasAndAHammer,2025-04-26T04:30:43,4

"> The next level is horrific.   The statu quo is horrific.  Protests that are aggressive enough can overthrow governments without any violence but not without the threat of violence.  >  'Cause if you have an ace up your sleeve, we'd love to hear it.  Turns out, if you are totally against any sort of implied violence, there is still a very effective way of changing policies: the general strike. It is arguably much more effective than violence at changing policy.   Problem: it requires strong unions and unions networks, something Americans felt they did not need and did not care much when they were busted. You need to organize these yesterday!  And lastly, there is another thing that your federal system allows, if you live in a blue state, promote independence, secession. I personally doubt that this is the best option, but that's the ""easiest"" given the state of disarray and apathy in the American public. It may appeal to the hyper-legalistic, but is probably the most likely to lead to military levels of violence.",keepthepace,2025-04-26T15:44:56,1
"So... the answer is nothing then? Cool.   Actually being in the situation, I am going to continue to try and do my best in dealing with the problems we have here. You are free to do what you want.   Organizing and setting up a resistance *has* worked many times in the past. The reason you can't find examples is because they worked and ended up *not* resulting in a civil war. The thing is that we are constantly fighting against Fascism. Every time this country has turned away from that path in the past without violence is an example of the process working.  This time, peaceful protest may or may not work. But it is the first step toward organizing a resistance, and one that too many people like you try and denigrate despite the tactic working against oppression in the past. Does it always work? No. But it certainly is the first reasonable step to get more people engaged.  -Edit- Oh cool. Make an easily refutable comment directly asking me questions, then block me. Cool. Cool. You were definitely, totally a good-faith participant in the discussion. Cool.",Alatain,2025-04-26T09:21:10,2

"Okay tough guy, who do we shoot? Your naive outside perspective acts like we’re all over here in cages rattling our empty tin cups against the cage bars. Like jfc, shit hasn’t even really changed for the vast majority here. Yes, what they’re doing is scary, but so long as people have something to lose, they’re unlikely to throw it all away to spend the rest of their life in prison for fighting or hurting a LEO, that may or may not have a warrant.    Did you ever read history and wonder WHY nobody did anything until it was too late? Do you think the Germans didn’t have a plethora of historical events that were warning signs for the Nazis? It’s almost like throwing your life away and resorting to violence are last ditch efforts for a majority of the human population, like maybe the reason we have societies is because we’re not all loose canons constantly looking for the perfect opportunity to throw our lives away.    I’m sorry the turmoil currently happening in our country isn’t bloody or violent enough for you. And I know the real reason you’re on here quietly advocating for violence is because you know that if it gets too bad or too late for us Americans to do something that the bullies here might come to your neighborhood next, and then YOU would have to do something about it, and that scares you, as it should.",Respurated,2025-04-26T11:37:48,2

"You are hearing a specific action vs taking any action. Protests do not work, never have, never will. They are cathartic and make you feel less angry. You need to feel angry to stop this. You need to feel like you can take small actions that disrupt, unbalance and build hurdles for their momentum. You don't have to be a soldier, you don't have to shoot someone. There are other ways of ""flooding the zone."" If you wait till you have nothing to lose, then you have lost it all.",littlebopeepsvelcro,2025-04-27T12:43:09,0
"We have laws to prevent one person from owning too much news media. Of all the popular nightly news bulletins, he owns one.  You don't know anything about Australia.

For example, did you know our conservative party is roughly in line with the US Democrats? Of course you didn't.   I'm betting you couldn't even explain why mandatory voting is of benefit in preventing a Trump-like take over.

"The commenter I responded to was definitely making violent innuendos in the thread.    I am mad as hell, the events and actions caused by this admin has had a direct effect on the people in my life. I take action within my community, and while I do use Reddit, I do NOT consider it part of my community (nor any social media or technological platform for that matter). And in that respect I find all the “tough guy” talk, judgements, and assumptions about who is doing what, when and where absolutely cringe. The only thing you know about me is what I post on here. We do not share a community, we share words on a platform, that is owned by the very same people cuddling-up to the authoritarianism currently running amuck in our government. That is to say, I trust this platform we communicate in less than I trust you as an individual, which is not at fucking all.",Respurated,2025-04-27T14:53:23,1
