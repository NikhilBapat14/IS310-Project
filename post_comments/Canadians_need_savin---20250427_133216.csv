"Of course it's true....Carney is far more dangerous to Canada than Trump is....but Canadians were indeed going to be saved from the Libs had Trump not gone rogue and repeatedly insulted them about their sovereignty. This one is an own-goal by Trump....but he'll never admit it because he's incapable of any real introspection. As an American, I'm less concerned about how Canada's relationship with the USA will be impacted by Carney (as Trump says, the USA is holding all the cards)....than I am about Canada's well-being as a Western nation and neighbor. Trudeau was a real nightmare....and Carney will likely be no better.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T18:10:48,31
