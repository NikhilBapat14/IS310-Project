"Unlikely. The DOJ has released their justification that the Heroes Act (which also allowed Trump and Biden to pause interest/payments) gives the DOEd the power to forgive the loans.   [link](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/use-heroes-act-2003-cancel-principal-amounts-student-loans)  Edit: in order to reverse this they would first have to justify standing. Then argue against the heros act justification. Not sure they can.  Also it would be another blow to the GOP if they reverse this, who appears to be taking some hits lately.",korinth86,2022-08-31T18:52:35,6
You have to prove harm to have standing to sue. No one was harmed so who will sue?,Alantsu,2022-08-31T16:24:01,4
"I don't know, can the $7 Trillion Trump donated to the 1% be reversed? How about the $6 Trillion Bush gave to the 1%? Can THAT be reversed? People are pissed off some students got help, but are 100% fine with tax payers paying for the $13 Trillion two republicans passed out to the ultra-wealthy who don't need my tax dollars to survive. When I get a promise the rich will pay back that money I'll support reversing the help for students.",GTRacer1972,2022-09-05T15:03:50,1
"I agree the standing issue is a problem. However, if the courts heard the case it's unlikely they'd buy the notion that Congress implicitly allocated hundreds of billions of dollars because the President wants to pretend they did.  In terms of the political fallout, I'd say it's almost pure upside for the GOP. It's a massively popular policy amongst people who are voting Democratic anyway - and an unpopular one amongst the working class swing voters the Democrats need keep to retain power.",ViskerRatio,2022-09-02T21:41:19,1
"That’s true, but there’s a few ideas floating around some lawyer reddits I follow and the top contenders for standing are loan servicers and individuals who had their loans automatically forgiven but did not want them to be forgiven for whatever reason.",SGP_MikeF,2022-08-31T23:15:55,1

"Those same people remember how Republicans gave out $7 Trillion to the top under Trump that we all have to pay back. Will those same working people support taking that money back from the top, or do they want their taxes to pay for it?",GTRacer1972,2022-09-05T15:05:00,2
"Yep, it's dividing the Democratic base; those who have paid back their loans or never went to college vs those who have student loan debt. They really should have thought this thru as a blanket executive decision",Bmomm,2022-09-30T18:50:15,1
"> Those same people remember how Republicans gave out $7 Trillion to the top under Trump that we all have to pay back.  Do you have any source for that ""$7 Trillion"" claim? The only action I can think of that merit that sort of criticism would be the 2017 tax bill - most of which hasn't even been enacted yet.",ViskerRatio,2022-09-05T15:45:13,0
"Nice arguement but that ship has sailed. Plus it was a Congressional decision, so unfortunately thete was no grounds for lawsuits. I agree it was wrong but the way they went about it was legal",Bmomm,2022-09-30T18:52:47,1
