"So without going into too many details, here's the key findings of the report.  https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/  Additionally, I won't be touching on Trump and his actions (and those of his campaign) called out in the report.  But Presidents largely rely on a ""mandate"" messaging after they win to try and achieve goals. This is why Presidents will claim large victories and a mandate from the masses, even if the victory was small, to try to get other politicians and the public on board with their agenda. The Mueller investigation clouded the first 2 years of Trump's administration with chaos, investigation, and controversies. The Barr memo largely swept the findings under the rug, and the release of the final report didn't move the needle much.  However, Trump's Administration was chaotic anyway. I would expect this new Administration to be more efficient, but Trump's first Administration was full of its own controversies and issues without the Mueller Investigation. You'll recall nearly every week Trump would have something that came out that would be terrible for most politicians, but Trump shrugged them off. All this to say, the Mueller investigation, while an overarching investigation and stain on the Administration, was not a significant roadblock, and many of his problems were his own. All this is also background to the fact that Trump has no real agenda, and doesn't particularly care about policies or details.   So no, the Mueller Investigation cannot really be pointed to as a hindrance to his agenda, because there is no specific legislation that fell due to the investigation, the investigation was largely buried and ignored, and the Administration was full of chaos and controversy anyway. McCain, Collins, and Murkowski weren't going to repeal the ACA if Mueller wasn't there, and the Mueller investigation didn't prevent more tax cuts or the infrastructure bill from going through.",ProLifePanda,2025-01-03T16:14:50,2
