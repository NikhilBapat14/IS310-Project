"It's weird because the White House accounts look a lot like the Facebook pages of my older family members, with bad memes and weird AI crap. But whatever.",cathbadh,2025-05-05T07:09:24,19
"Can I be that one lib on here that says:  *yOu KnOw, HiTlEr WoUlD hAvE hAd A rEd LiGhTsAbEr ToO!*",Blue_Cheese_Olives,2025-05-04T19:41:33,21
This is the first wh meme Iâ€™ve been mad at. I hate Star Wars. Downvote me all you want sci fi is awful ðŸ‘Ž,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-04T23:06:56,-22
You can be the one with 100 burners that keeps raiding this subreddit.,Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T20:36:54,4
I think youâ€™re objectively wrong on that one. Youâ€™re telling me Alien or even Jurassic Park is *awful*?,MiceTonerAccount,2025-05-05T04:54:31,12
Ya. But if forced to pick Iâ€™d take those 2 over anything like Star Trek or lord of the rings. Was forced to watch return of the Jedi in high school English class and thought I might die.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-05T07:23:04,-4
Lord of the rings isnâ€™t even sci-fi. Youâ€™re just objectively wrong and loudly incorrect,just_one_random_guy,2025-05-05T13:43:12,0
Canâ€™t be wrong about an opinion yours is just different. I consider lord of the rings and star trek the same- fucking terrible. It is what it is.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-05T16:53:07,-2
No itâ€™s objectively wrong,just_one_random_guy,2025-05-05T17:03:05,-1
Again opinions about personal taste in movies canâ€™t be wrong. Keep going I wonâ€™t see any of your useless responses.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-05T18:20:44,0
