The problem isn’t trump or has ever been trump. It’s the maga people who have supported him. He should have been publicly shamed and removed from candidacy for making fun of the disabled reporter.

">Maybe those geographically stuck with us like Latin America and Canada?    I would respectfully have to disagree with you on this one unless the US decides to invade and occupy Canada and Latin America.     >Canada will eventually likely turn around somewhat,   I think you are mistaken in that assumption. Threatening Canada with unnecessary tariffs is bad enough, damaging our economy for funsies destroys a lot of good will for the US but threatening Canadian sovereignty is the one seals the deal for us. The majority of Canadians are eager to see Canada do more business with Europe, the pacific and anyone other than the US. Canada is the prime example as to what happens when a nations gets too close and economically integrated with the US and I don’t think other nations will be all that eager to tie themselves too closely to the US if they had literally any other choice.    For Canada it’s a matter of national survival to separate ourselves from the US permanently. It’s a little weird for the US to try its best to destroy our economy and threaten to annex us and then expect Canada to be in its sphere of influence.",sig_1,2025-04-07T00:21:42,40
"The Global markets and nations of the world, including the US, crave stability with Congress being completely ineffective for the last several years and leaders increasingly relying on executive orders why would you partner with the US? The 27 nations of the EU are re-arming thanks to President Dump Truck, diplomatically they will never turn back. why would you enter any agreement with the US when one of the parties is taking this insane near isolationist perspective and stabbing all their allies in the back. you wanna take that risk every four years? As a business owner, I wouldn't enter deal with the US right now, too unstable. I imagine the nations of the world will also start dumping the US dollar as reserve currency. We are all witnessing the dissolution of the US Global Hegemony thanks to assholes with no understanding of the global environment.

"There's no going back without a massive, overwhelming public repudiation of not just Trump, but the entire MAGA universe.

There's no telling what more damage will occur before, or even if, we have the chance to start fixing it.  Meanwhile, this isn't _actually_ the junior high schoolyard these people are acting like it is.   The Trump administration has instituted chaos, which they mistakenly think they can control.

The world quickly forgave Germany after WW2 because the Nazis were defeated, Hitler died, most of the officers were executed, thousands jailed. Then the nation was occupied and had 3 years of post war deprogramming. The laws were written to avoid it happening again.  Clearly this isn't likely to happen here. But if the US wants to recover reputation faster than decades, then pretty extreme measures will need to be taken.

The Republicans and churches have been attacking education since 1969 or even sooner. Corporations lobby and donate to too many politicians.

Trump was elected by the American people and he and his administration reflect an important aspect of what America is.   When Vance refers to ""Chinese peasants"", he is echoing what I have heard ordinary Americans say. The administrations pogrom on immigrants is symptomatic of a deep xenophobia that is a part of the entire American culture.  Musk's brutal cutting of support for those in need embodies the ""Ive got mine so f\*ck you"" attitude that is deeply engrained in the American psyche.

"I'm not sure about East Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, as they're usually more reserved and seem to ""ride along"" to whatever the US says or does, but it really depends on how the damage will be felt in the near future. Browsing through Korean news, they're still a lot more concerned and excited about the presidential impeachment (elections possibly being held on June 3rd). In Korea's case, they were running in cruise control-mode for the past several months, but with an actual president post-election, I think the direction will depend on who that person might be. At the moment, the companies are just trying to get deals and bypass the tariffs with the US, so it's still a bit more neutral compared to European sentiments.  Personally, I think South Korea's going to be one of the first countries to work with the new administration and treat it like a 'water under the bridge.""

That essentially means two things: consequenecs for those who caused it (to stop others from doing it again), and changes to law and government to make it impossible.  So, Trump and his lackies in jail and a re-write of the Constitution to rebalance the powers of the three branches and reduce the power the President currently holds.  I don't think the above is possible. At the moment all the US has is a powerful military and a big economy (for people to sell things to). Trump is already destroying the economy to sell things to via tarrifs.  Realistically, the US's position in the world has permanently changed.

"It will take re-establishing the normal relations with other countries, restarting the soft power programs that DOGE and Trump cut, and then being reliable and consistent in trade/military/foreign aid/international efforts over decades (yes, decades) and over that time period trust will slowly build up again.  The negative feelings towards the US from people currently living will probably never fully go away.  It will lessen over time but the resentment/distrust won't fade fully and will get passed down to following generations in a weaker form but still there.  The benefits that the US got from being so reliable and with so much built-up goodwill and trust will have to be re-earned over time, and things will be harder/more expensive for the US in the meantime.  Do you remember when Obama took office after George W. Bush?  Obama sent Hilary Clinton basically on a global apology tour for a year to try to mend relations with so many other countries (friend and foe) that had been pushed away and offended by Bush.  To let them know that the good version of the USA was back.

"While it’s easy to say “in time, it can be rebuilt” but more needs to happen than that.  We need to fix the systems that got us to here.       The first thing might actually be to toss Executive Orders into the sun or at least limit the scope of them so one person can’t rule via EO decree like we are seeing right now.  It’s still too early, but I have a feeling this is “one of those ways” Trump believes he can run for a third term.      The second is to rebuild and to reinforce checks and balances.  It starts with further strengthening inspector generals and watchdog groups so they just can’t get fired on a whim.  Almost to the point they’re untouchable from this shit ever again.  This also means to take away a current attempt by MAGA to just give more power to the President.  And the final part to this is straight up term limits, especially at the Supreme Court.  Personally, think it’s 20 years max and we Logan Run you off the bench. But we stagger the current judges so one is replaced every 2 years and that no one President gets to make more than 2 judges in one term.  And to callously stick to that.  If a judge dies in office and POTUS has gotten their two picks, we are just down a judge until the next term/POTUS.

"We won’t. This is irreparable harm. We operated at a global super power level because we didn’t do crazy shit. Carter versus Reagan, JFK or LBJ versus Nixon, Clinton versus Bush (either) were not crazy swings. They’re policy and ideology moves.  Trump pt 1. Was bad. Like bad bad. Like question everything you know about the US bad. Trump pt 2 is just simply the death of the US as the one global super power. We had power for many reasons - wealth, economic dominance, military power, etc - but we built it, kept it, grew it and maintained it because we were relatively predictable.   The last really crazy thing we did was fight a random war - i.e. Iraq. And you know what 60 years of being the stable guardrail got us? The majority of western military powers joined a BS war.  If 9/11 happened in 2025, forget Iraq, do you think we’d have support to invade Afghanistan? Answer, some, but not overwhelming global support.   If you want to understand what trump has done, you have to go back to Hoover. Not in the economic terms, but that matters. But think of it this way: what did we do post Hoover?  We/the US was a critical component in: 1940s:  winning a global war, stopping a genocide, curbing dictatorships, pulling the world out of a global depression, inventing and deploying the most powerful weapon of all time  1950s: not using the most powerful weapon of all time, trying and executing the genocidal maniacs and dictators, building a thriving domestic economy, developing the interstate system (I mean actually think about this the 1950s US created the modern concept of highways people shit on the US for public transit but the autobahn was conceive of in the late 1920s, built in the mid 1930s, meanwhile the US in the 50s built like 10k autobahns across a geography of roughly all of Europe not just germany)  In the 1960s what did we do? We began a Cold War with the other super power (probably the first Cold War in history, we didn’t do much fighting. Other than the 50s this was probably the most peaceful decade in history, a Cold War was novel), we prevented nuclear apocalypse multiple times, Kennedy created USAID, the peace corps, americorps, etc. We used our security and wealth to build global relations. Side note this is when First, Third world became terminology. Also, first world was initially referencing only that it was a capitalist country. Third world was a communist country. Second world was unaligned with the US/USSR. It subsequently became a reflection of global wealth. But still rocking the 60s we passed Medicare, the civil rights act and the voting rights act, we had some rough times with the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war, but it took South Africa to have a civil rights moment in the 90s, Tibet has been a thing for decades and is still a thing.  OK. Our probably shittiest post ww2 decade, the 1970s, what did we do? Well we had a president just fuck around, try to steal an election, fire his whole justice department, etc. He got investigated by a free press, and despite his best efforts, he ended up voluntarily resigning. Then a solid peaceful transfer of power. Then in comes the dude Jimmy “I forget his peanut middle name” Carter. What does he do? Well not a shit ton. He gets us into some shit in the Middle East but why? Because he doesn’t do what the next few/all presidents do: fight a war for oil. What happens, roughly OPEC gets a bit pissed off because he doesn’t just fight a war because we had oil interests in Iran associated with the Shah. Iran takes a bunch of hostages for a while, the nation basically never talks to Iran again, we suddenly become friends with other countries like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iraq - you know summer camp friends. Then he loses to our boy Reagan - THE ACTOR?  So what’s the 80s look like? Well for starters, the economy roars until 1987. We pump that money into ridiculous long term investments that the USSR attempts to match. That doesn’t go great for the USSR. They struggle to feed people, their international programs are largely abandoned as they struggle to provide for their own people. Blocks start to fray, and the inevitable is on the horizon.   So to the 90s. Guess what, we do war again: We invade Iraq because they fucked around with our Kuwaiti friends and seemed to threaten the saudis. So we go a fuck up iraq beating them with newer versions of the weapons we gave them a bit ago. But then what else happens. The USSR falls, we are the lone global super power. We use this largess to violently enforce peace globally - Iraq for instance, but also Bosnia and Serbia. We ride a killer stock market and an IQ economy explosion: the dot com bubble. Our president fucks and intern and then reciprocally fucks Iraq again. But we leave good.  New millennium, we’re rocking the 2000s now. What happens, the largest attack on US soil since 1941, we are rattled. But the world rises to our aid and fucks up a pile of rocks in Afghanistan. We roll the government like an NCAA tournament 16 seed in March. Then, kinda stupidly, we do a whole as bonus war. The world is like: ‘I don’t know about that, buddy.’ But most of the countries with a boat that can act as an airport sign off none the less. We fight, we win in the sense that getting a free buffet dinner after losing $10k at the casino is a free meal. Shit’s not great. The economy collapses. Like fucking bad, like Great Depression and dust bowl bad. US does the right thing and just throws billions at the problem. Economy still sucks, but we prevented the grapes of wrath sucking from the teet scenario. We elect Obama, shit sucks, but not a thinly veiled mother Mary allowing an old man to suckle her suck.  So 2010s. We pull back on wars. Less war != no war. After making fun of Bush v 2 for pretzels, we are back to fully respected globally, bush was tolerated, not respected. We join a bunch of international agreements, Iran Deal, Paris climate accord. Internal discord, but international community doesn’t matter. 2010 we elected a bunch of fucking morons. But 2012 we beat the asshole who appears to be sane by comparison 5 years later. 2014, another bunch of morons.  Then we hit 2016. We elect him. But people around him, generals, his Chiefs of Staff, his cabinet secretaries keep him from driving the unusually short bus into the Keebler elf’s tree. International elections are basically meh. You got brexit which is like Britain’s version of a suicide bombing, but Canada, France, Germany continually elect normalish people.  2020s: World gets sick. Biden. Biden does great, boring shit. World gets boat stuck in water. Biden has another birthday. Boat still stuck. Also factories are still sick. Biden blows out another candle. Is this boat still fucking stuck? Yup.  Trump wins.   Now here is why we will never recover: We have led this world almost unilaterally since 1945 because we were stable. Trump has erased trust that even Bush, Nixon, Reagan, Carter, etc benefited from. The difference between Bush 2 and Obama or Carter and Reagan is so massively less than Trump 1 versus trump 2.   We have lost all ability to make promises that stretch beyond 5 days is gone. We made promises in 1949 that were upheld to 2021. Now we’ll put a tariff on you on Tuesday, revoke it Wednesday, double it Thursday and then watch a Saudi sponsored golf tournament for a few days.  The world thought that trump 1 was a fluke and so we were given a pass. Trump 2 is viewed as cconfirmation that we are no longer predictable.",iamapolitico,2025-04-07T14:30:26,2

"Ignoring the fact that Republicanism is now Trumpism, and this may continue after him, let's assume that a future administration as you say wants to rebuild international relationships.  Here are my thoughts, as a long-time Canadian observer with direct American ties looking at the US situation.  First, the US, due to lack of international co-operation, will no longer necessarily be a world leader in many things.  They may be reduced to a regional hegemon.  Second, a thus weakened US will have to demonstrate to other nations that they are willing to interact in good faith.  I see this as re-signing the Paris Accord, signing and ratifying the ICJ and ICC, and vowing to limit or eliminate their use of Security Council veto, if the Security Council continues to exist in its present form.  Third, aligning with some does not mean aligning with all.  There may have to be a demonstrable limiting of relations with non-democratic countries, and we know who those are.  Fourth, the US will have to demonstrate, with international observers, electoral reform.  This may mean changes or elimination of the electoral college, a move to fully independent electoral commissions (they can look to Canada for advice here), and constitutional guarantees of voters' rights and penalties for voter suppression.  This may mean the states giving up some of their powers over elections as well, or independent electoral commissions enforced on every state.",PostConv_K5-6,2025-04-07T14:42:11,1

Sadly there are so many Americans cheering him on even though a disaster is unfolding before their eyes.  There is something deeply wrong with Trump and his acolytes. They delight in insulting and attacking their allies. They take extra delight in behaving offensively towards other nations. But strangely enough they are obsequious to the point of fawning on Russia who for so long have been anti everything that the USA has stood for. Trump and his gang of fools don't know when they are being played and are not just putting Americans in danger but the rest of the world.  When you insult the leaders of other countries, and you insult their country, their economy, their people, the insult sticks. An ”oh I'm sorry, I did not mean that”, will not cut it. America and Americans will likely pay a big price to restore relations to just a level of basic civility. I think with their pride hurt, and having been once bitten and are now twice shy, other countries will treat the USA with some suspicion long after Trump administration has ceased.

"This is what I keep saying. Sure, the government is corrupt as hell, but the corruption runs deep into the masses as well. Unchecked capitalism has spread the roots of its greed into the American population, infecting everyday humans with a degree of apathy and selfishness unseen in most other countries.   People turn on their neighbors and isolate from their communities. Tribalism runs rampant, anyone who isn’t on the same side is objectively evil. Conservatives scream hatred at Liberals about trans rights and abortions, and Liberals fire back with worthless identity politics and hatred of the uneducated, all to feed their own egos.  Schools of children become sacrificial lamb pens for the mental agony of single individuals who are so caught up in their own suffering, that selfish “me, me, me”, that they don’t even realize they are slaughtering innocent children to relieve their pain until it is too late, and then, still caught in their selfishness, they take their own lives.  Politics in America reflects this selfishness. Debates become embarrassing reality TV shows where selfish people are kings because they reflect the American value of “mine”, and we end up with clowns like Donald Trump, who is the epitome of selfishness and in my opinion the ultimate reflection of the true American Dream; utter selfishness embodied, a person so devoid of empathy and compassion that he would choose a single dollar over the lives of millions without blinking an eye.  Trump is the peak of America. He is self-centeredness embodied, and Americans put him there, because they were obsessed with themselves too, and either wanted that selfishness to prevail or were too selfish to go and make their voices heard.  Americans love to clown on the greed of those above them, but they fail to see their own greed.

"> I don't think the problem is constitutional reform, it's legislative. Too much power has been ceded by the legislature to the executive.  You then list a bunch of examples. But that's the point: if the legislature is ceding power to the executive on every issue, then there must be a systemic reason why, something driving it, and fixing that systemic reason would require constitutional reform.  Part of that systemic issue is that Congress is very ineffective. It is locked in gridlock much of the time, either because the House and Senate are at odds, or because Congress and the President are at odds and Congress doesn't have enough to overcome the veto. This gridlock is built into the Constitution, before things like hyper-partisanship or the Senate filibuster make it worse. So Congress, unable to move quickly or decide things in detail, necessarily cedes the power and responsibility to the executive branch and the President. And this repeats, on issue after issue, until people think the US was always supposed to have an imperial Presidency.",just_helping,2025-04-07T17:25:09,3

Regardless, it could finally put to rest a lot of the discussions about whether or not immigrants benefit our economy.

"This is transforming a collective problem into an individual responsibility. It is saying that if only voters took their responsibility to educate themselves more seriously, we wouldn't be in this mess.   It's not untrue. Sufficiently talented and hardworking people can indeed overcome any obstacle. But it doesn't change the fact that the system is an obstacle to making it clear which politician and which party is responsible for which outcome. There are too many hidden veto points, too many opportunities to blame the opponent. The Republicans take advantage of this, but it is the arrangement of the Constitution that enables and incentivizes their actions.   I think expecting people to have an educated clear-eyed opinion on who is responsible for what problem (or more frequently who is blocking what solution) and sustaining that level of analysis indefinitely into the future, is a much bigger ask than structural reform to help make who is responsible for what more obvious.

"I don't disagree with this, but I think it misses the forest for the trees. The Republican party embarked on hyper-partisanship, the question is: why did they do that? Why did that help them? Why didn't that hurt them? And the answer is: it did hurt them sometimes because voters correctly saw that they were responsible, but more often voters didn't see that the Republican party was creating the problem. The way the US Constitution arranges power creates incentives for this sort of behaviour, it makes it hard for the typical voter to correctly see who is causing what result. The Constitution also makes it hard to solve problems and easy to create them.  And this isn't the first time the US has been in this situation. Prior to the Great Depression, the US also had hyper-partisanship and often felt gridlocked. The middle of the 20th century is unusual, not an equilibrium that Regan and Gingrich pushed us from, but the chance result of Depressions and Wars, and the unlikely and unstable alliance of northern working class and southern white supremacists that mean the Democratic party was dominant for a very long time. The last forty years has been a return to the sort of politics that the Constitution incentivizes. If we look at other countries with similar Constitutions, we see the same thing.  If nothing changes structurally, even if Trump is seen as a disaster and we have fair-enough elections to get rid of him, we will be back in this problem or similar within a decade.",just_helping,2025-04-08T05:29:41,1

But if you make the court really big, like it would be if all appellate court justices were on it  then you dilute the power and idiosyncrasies of any individual justice and perhaps we can move back towards professionalism.

"I see where you are going. I think what you are saying makes sense, but feel a little differently about it. I actually think the US Hegemony has been a mechanism for peace in the last 80 years. I could be wrong. The way I read it I would argue breaking it up will lead to more instability and I believe the Trump administration DOES want to end the US' global hegemony... i will explain why. Let me give you a few reasons why I think US military power keeps peace. If you look at the world since WWII, we have not had another world war. Why is that? I think there are a few reasons. First, I would say nuclear deterrence... nobody wants a nuclear war, it's the ultimate trump card. I would argue the nuclear triad (submarines, strategic bombers, and land-based missiles) together are a major deterrent to any war activity. At any point, there are a significant number of nuclear subs, nobody knows how many, who can strike with traditional or nuclear weapons, floating around deep beneath the oceans surface, nobody knows where they are, that can wipe any nation off the map. This threat keeps people from getting out of line. Secondly, I would say the formation of the UN and NATO, allows nations to band together and use economic sanctions, and trade threats instead of bombs to stop bad actors. Granted this model is not perfect...  look at the middle east... however, thus far it has been a bulwark against widescale multi-nation wars, like WWII. However, think about how fucked up it COULD be if every nation was essentially on their own. NATO is largely the same except it is military power, you have 32 nations who have a pact to defend anybody of the NATO members who get attacked. This mutual and collective pact of protectionism, keeps bad actors in line. Even fiercely independent Finland recently joined as a mechanism to deter the Russians, they joined in 2023. The real teeth behind NATO is US military power, the pact (NATO) and the US military likely has saved and prevented numerous wars and battles. If you remove the military might, the Soviets would have likely tried to expand their domain, and I do think without the US in NATO, Russia could be much more aggressive. So now as President Dump Truck backs us out of NATO the EU is rearming.... granted if the EU & UK did have an army that could deter aggression from Russia that is a step in the right direction... maybe. The EU has a GDP of around $20 trillion, Russia about $2 trillion, so if they make the proper military investments they can certainly defend themselves on their own. The problem is they have under invested for years as they rebuilt their economies after WWII and they never really rebuilt a meaningful military. The US served that role, which it looks like it about to change. So imagine if you will a re-armed Europe. I think that has the ingredients for MORE war not less. I would say we are entering a very precarious point in world history. Look at what the world was like in Europe before when each nation/empire had their own capable army, you had conflict after conflict. I will use Germany as an example. Let's say that Germany rearms to the gills. I think we have an idea of how that ""could"" go. They re-arm, a ultra-right wing nationalist government takes over, what is going to happen from there forward? We have seen run this experiment before. I love Germany and German don't get me wrong, but there AfD party came in second in the last election.   Lastly, if you study the anti-globalist agenda as outlined by Steve Bannon, James Corsi, in the Anti-Globalist Manifesto, and others, they claim the US should essentially self isolate from the globe. They don't use those exact words but that is what they describe. They think the US is an empire due to the our global hegemony. It is a combination of 6 factors: 1.) World Bank 2.) the US being the world's reserve currency 3.) the US dollar as the basis for the world's oil trade 4.) NATO, and 5.) the UN 6.) Global military presence with ~ 120 bases in 55 countries or territories. . They want to unwind all of it and just keep the military to defend the US and focus on US domestic concerns. I think doing so will create MORE instability in the world as the policeman of the world retires. I think without the US military deterrent and NOT having the US as  WTO, UN, NATO would lead to greater economic instability internationally.  The anti-globalist are anti-free trade, anti-immigrate, focus on self sovereignty over supranationalism, finally (weirdly) support nations that support your global dominance ONLY. I admit I am not an expert and could be wrong on alot of this but I have dipped my toe in the anti-globalist artifacts available on the web and honestly I think it is recipe for a new, much less stable world order. Again, I am willing to be wrong on this but I think that is where we are headed. I read the whole anti-globalist manifesto and parts of Project 2025, Trump is following the playbook exactly.

"Getting constitutional reform is going to be extremely difficult unless voters turnout in massive numbers, completely repudiate the Republican Party- not just at the federal level, but the state level.  Just getting an amendment resolution out of Congress would be almost impossible.  It needs 290 votes in the House and 67 in the Senate.  But let's say that happens.  Now it goes to the states.  Right now, only 18 states have legislatures where both Houses are in Democratic hands.  Each state has different rules for ratifying an amendment- some are simple majority, others are a 2/3rds majority.    Think of it this way:  There are currently 27 Amendments to the Constitution. Numbers 1 through 10 were passed all at once- the Bill of Rights.  Number 27 was part of that original package but amazingly wasn't ratified until 1992.  Three amendments concern voting right (15, 20, & 26).  Two- (18 & 21) cancel each other out.  That leaves us with just ten other amendments that actually make real changes to things outside of voting rights... in almost 240 years!    What do think will happen, is there will be legislative reform to do various things I mention.  That would just take a Democratic controlled Congress and some sort of filibuster reform (elimination isn't needed).  Of course, anything passed would almost certainly get challenged in court.  But if one of those reforms is expanding the Supreme Court- which is absolutely legal and absolutely does not need to be an amendment- then those reforms would be safe.   Everything depends on the next couple of national elections and the economy.  Democrats can take control of the House and Senate in 2027 (2026 elections).  If they win big, that could scare enough GOP members to change things.  If the economy is truly in the shitter, that will be an advantage to Democrats.  The important thing is Democrats seriously need to get younger and more forceful leadership.

I admit that is not reality and that there are many people who vote without actually bothering to do the research on who and what their voting for and the importance of said vote.   That being said I don't believe a structural change -short of the institution of a plato inspired enlightened oligarchy (singular despots centralize too much power where more people can check people's powers) can solve the issues as those in power, regardless of structural changes, will be able to dissuade the over educated to vote and encourage the under engaged to vote for them creating the same problems but under a new system.

"Correct it is based on correlation. I don't disagree that the world order should be governed by International Law, equality, justice, a desire for a habitable planet, however I do think the world is moving away, rather than toward the state you describe. I am a member of the Sierra Club and have spoken to local politicians about their environmental policy, it's remarkable how some of them simply don't care or don't want to spend the time. I feel the US acting as world policeman was a outgrowth of WWII. Most modern economies and manufacturing capability was destroyed after WWII, I think it was an arrangement of necessity and the wests strained relationships with the Soviets. We stepped into the role and it expanded. I would love total nuclear disarmament and a shift to a greener agenda but there are such strong, shortsighted forces against that trend it feels like an impossibility right now. How and why would China ever give up it's nukes? I am no Trump fan either but he did say he was interested in participating in nuclear disarmament discussions with China & Russia. I cannot think of a politician who has discussed this in recent years, there was Obama's Iran nuclear deal, but that is different. The other interesting part is most modern nuclear bombs developed after the mid/late eighties are neutron bombs some of which theoretically have very little to no fallout. So conceivably the use of nuclear weapons would not be an end to humanity. I am not proposing we try it out, just stating, I don't think the use of a nuclear weapon would automatically equate to the annihilation of humanity.  If you look at trends, the use of fossil fuels is still increasing even if their use is decreasing as a percentage of total energy. The total energy consumption in the world is increasing faster than we can add green energy. We aren't necessarily moving in the right direction. Humans has shown remarkable ignorance when worrying about something that we perceive as very far off. Perhaps the mutually assured destruction discussed around nuclear annihilation will be caused by climate catastrophes instead. I listened to a fascinating podcast this weekend that cited the following:  Based on current estimates and consumption rates, known oil reserves are expected to last for roughly 47 to 50 years, we have enough coal reserves to last roughly 130 to 150 years, access to fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially running out in many areas of the world by 2040 or 2050. I am not entirely sure it's accurate, but assuming it is, it is very alarming and should prompt more action. I think overtime it will, but by then it might be too late.",Buddha-Of-Suburbia,2025-04-07T14:14:24,1

"First off, you're redefining the original point into one that is easy and palatable to discuss. I was not countering 'hard core bigots lie about their positions', I was countering 'all Republican voters are completely in line with Trump, and anyone who expresses another view is just lying for social acceptance'. If your entire point is 'some people will not change', then I've been agreeing with you from the jump and I don't know why you're bothering to argue still.  Second off, even taking it as read that the original point was 'hard core bigots lie about their positions', you're still writing off *millions* of people with those sweeping 'probablies' and 'maybies'. While it may not be on you *individually* to have a bit of grace and patience to every right winger in your life, it's still important as a political movement and society as a whole to give folks at the extremes an exit ramp. Not wanting to be around cult-like people *all the time* is fine. But assuming that everyone who's fallen victim to cult-like thinking can never be redeemed and should be left to their fate is *exactly* what the right wing wants you to do. And I don't know about you, but if I ever find myself doing what my opponent wants, I take a long hard think about why I'm doing it and what I get out of it.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-07T12:39:53,3
"That's exactly what you said. It may not have been what you *meant*, but it's the logical conclusion from the words you chose to type.   And even if only a few of them chose to change (which is still an absurdly dogmatic take for almost *eighty million* people), they should still be encouraged when they start to do so. As opposed to the dogmatic take of 'if they say they have regrets, they're just lying for social acceptance' that I first replied to.  Is the statement of 'people don't usually change their worldview in one go. We should encourage people who start to change to continue' really so hard for people to wrap their heads around? Don't fool yourself for a second that the left isn't just as vulnerable to the in-group biases we criticize on the right. It's not compromizing your values to say we should let people change rather than assume that they never will",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-08T14:37:21,1

">it's still important as a political movement and society as a whole to give folks at the extremes an exit ramp.  And that exit ramp is, ""if you actually change your fundamental values and beliefs in favor of basic human decency and respect for rule of law then I will accept you as someone worth interacting with."" Something that broadly isn't being argued against. Your position is much more along the lines of telling people to remain friendly acquaintances of these people so that they have someone normal to fall back on the off chance they decide to change.   >But assuming that everyone who's fallen victim to cult-like thinking can never be redeemed and should be left to their fate is exactly what the right wing wants you to do.

If we're talking actual political strategy here, the right doesn't really think a whole lot about this. What they're overwhelmingly concerned with is, as I said in my original post, having institutional power. If every liberal and leftist decided to stop talking to their sexist granddad or old high school friend that fell down the tradwife pipeline then *maybe* that could be spun to their advantage, but if all of these people decided that the only way to save America was to get Republicans out of Congress and their state legislatures then that'd be an actual catastrophe.",urnever2old2change,2025-04-07T12:55:32,2

"Look man, if you're just going to put words in my mouth then what's the point of posting here instead of on your blog? There's a lot of daylight between 'be a casual acquaintance of every right winger in your life regardless of what they do' and 'shut them out entirely until they completely overhaul their worldview independently'. You don't have to be entirely quiet and passive to still be able to take someone expressing doubts to you as a sign that they might be willing to change as opposed to assuming that they're just lying for social acceptance.  The way that the right gets and maintains institutional power is by making it so their constituents feel like the only chance they have for social acceptance is in the company of other hard core right wingers. Everyone cutting their sexist granddad or tradwife friend out of their life made them *less* likely to turn to the comfort of an right wing infrastructure that's designed to isolate people from their support networks, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in right now. You don't have to accept everything they say at face value in order to give them an off ramp from that. But yeah, sometimes you have to put up with some bullshit from other people. That's part of living in a society. If we want to actually have a functional society, we need to have a way to talk folks down from the ledge and make it clear that you *can* come in from the cold without having to completely reinvent your worldview on your own with no social support network. There are *far* more people in the world that will make a positive change if given the opportunity to change incrementally than there are people that will abruptly change their entire worldview, and as a political movement there needs to be the room to allow that to happen. It doesn't have to be you, *personally*, in every circumstance.

That's part of living in a society.   This isn't really a worthwhile exercise, though. America isn't all that worse off because normal people aren't talking enough to the ones addicted to the Fox News, Andrew Tate outrage machine or who have simply always been hate-driven. America is worse off because this minority of the population does a better job winning elections, thereby gaining the ability to make its public policy.   >But left wing politics needs to give people an escape route from the extremes if you want long term stability.  How many people that regret voting for Trump on a *moral basis* do you actually envision there being? Not, ""he's fucking over my retirement savings with these tariffs - I wish he would've just stuck to the other stuff."" Now contrast this with the number of people who are even remotely economically left-leaning and wouldn't vote for the Republican Party but for whatever reason can't be bothered to vote for a Democrat either.

Yeah, Republicans get people locked into voting against their best interests by making it so the right wing is the only place they feel accepted. That is literally the entire point of my argument, and why playing along with it is a losing proposition.  As for how many people will be willing to change their minds if they're given an offramp? Literally millions. If even only 10% can be split off the left-hand side of Trump's voting block, were talking more than 7 million people. Hell, even if you're so pessimistic you think only *1%* of people who voted for him would ever have a moral change of heart your writing off more than the population of entire states. And you're right that it's not an either/or: even *if* you think that there's millions of unactivated voters on the extreme left that we should be courting instead, you should *still* provide some way for folks on the right to come back in from the cold.

">""If everything you said worked the opposite of how it does, we wouldn't be having this conversation."" No shit.  Being snarky and bad faith doesn't make you less wrong. The right maintains its institutional power by getting people partial to the Republican platform to turn out for elections to better effect than the Dems do with their own base. That voter turnout is the important part - not banking on homophobes getting sucked into right-wing rabbit holes after their gay niece decides she doesn't want to spend Thanksgiving with him anymore after the comments he made about her lifestyle. These people were already voting Republican, and they tend not to look at their homophobia (or whatever term applies in their particular case) as some moral failure on their part.   >and why playing along with it is a losing proposition.  Losing proposition how, though? You're acting as if people vote Republican because they're being written off for having sexist or racist  or homophobic views, instead of having these views and then losing contact with decent people for it. Maybe you desperately want it to be the case that this in particular is some big electoral loss for the Democrats, but you seem to fundamentally misunderstand why people even vote Republican.    >And you're right that it's not an either/or: even if you think that there's millions of unactivated voters on the extreme left that we should be courting instead, you should still provide some way for folks on the right to come back in from the cold.  It's very funny that you find ""I don't like either party but I'm tired of money in politics and everything getting more expensive"" to be an ""extreme left"" sympathy instead that of like, that of the average person on the street that doesn't know what party controls Congress.  And again, for the umpteenth time, ""providing some way back from the cold"" does not necessarily mean keeping in contact with hateful people. I don't know why you, as someone ostensibly concerned with helping the left gain political power, think that's the hill to die on. The left's message is not, has never been, and never will be, ""If you voted for Trump for any reason then you shouldn't bother changing your mind if you regret it."" If the 10% or 1% or whatever percentage of Trump voters who find his presidency to be *morally repugnant* actually make the decision to stop voting for the party that enables morally repugnant behavior then I'd applaud them on it, but it's ludicrous to think that this is the demographic that's going to save the Democratic Party to any meaningful degree and that the left is making some tragic mistake in treating the unrepentant majority of Trump voters the way they want to be treated.",urnever2old2change,2025-04-07T15:07:45,1

But if your homophobic aunt comes to you and expresses some doubts about Trump, it's stupid to shut her down just because she's not willing to immediately stop being a homophobe in the moment. Yes, there will be situations where you, as an individual, do not have an obligation to talk to someone. But making it a matter of *praxis* that there is no value at all in having the door open to let people begin to reconsider their views is just lazy. People do not, as a rule, make abrupt changes to their worldview, they need the space to actually learn and change. Reducing people down to dogmatic automatons doesn't reflect what people are actually like. Imagine if we had applied that logic to something like civil rights or gay rights? The problem of bigotry hasn't been eliminated, but to pretend that no progress has been made by convincing people to change their opinions in the past hundred years is just factually incorrect.  And as I've said multiple times, the key way that Republicans make people so reliably turn out is by making being Republican a key part of their identity and one that requires costly signalling to affirm. By writing off the majority of *22%* of the population as irredeemable bigots that are only worthy of your time if they have their come to Jesus moment on their own, you're playing into the social structure Republicans use to maintain control over their electorate.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-07T15:31:04,1

Well sure, in this hypothetical scenario, but in reality very, very, very few homophobic aunts are having doubts about Trump with regard to the morality of his policymaking. This entire conversation is over you taking issue with the idea of most Trump voters being dishonest about the underlying reasons they voted for him. Maybe that doesn't match your experiences, but it sure does match mine, and the vast majority of conservatives I know *don't see anything wrong with the types of conservative views that get them written off.*   As *actual* praxis it's infinitely more valuable to point decent people already sympathetic to the goals of the left in the direction of electoralism than it is to retain space in your life for people that you truly do not value and have deeply rooted disrespect for you just in case it's a stepping stone for their *potential* path to stop wishing the worst for other people.
