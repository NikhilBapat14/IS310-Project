This goes well beyond political. These girls were strip searched. This was pure planned evil with politics used as an excuse.,Probably_Fishing,2025-04-23T11:02:59,55
"It is not uncommon to be asked “where you’re staying” at customs, and perhaps be refused entry to a country when your answer isn’t satisfactory. However, being sent to jail, stripped of your clothing, etc., is very uncommon in a democratic country. ",CLUSSaitua,2025-04-23T11:27:38,30

They didn't book hotels for the full 5 weeks. They did have some hotels booked but because they didn't know what island they would be on or what part of the island they didn't book every night.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-23T11:26:30,20

"I've been asked many times about what hotel I'm staying at, most recently when visiting Iceland in February.  It's fairly normal I think, but getting detained, strip searched, and deported for not having made reservations in advance is completely insane.",evilalien103,2025-04-23T14:40:56,5

"As justification, the border officials claim that they wanted to make money on the trip, which is not allowed with a tourist visa. It feels like a justification argument that sounds fabricated. I think that two small German girls, in a foreign country, with a foreign language, could be put under pressure very easily. I say to my European friends that they shouldn't visit me at the moment.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-23T11:09:56,13

"Many countries check to see if there’s some sort of accommodation even if on a “hike” vacation (pretty common in the US).   So even on American long trails (AT, PCT) requiring a 3 to 6+ month visa for most nights under a tent/tarp, .. it’s recommended the first hotel stay be the official address of the entire trip (note: overnight hikers will generally get a room every few days or so just to shower .. the “trail town” economies expect this unless a hiker is doing a speedy itinerary or going for a speed record .. aka “FKT”).  Actually had something similar happen when trying to enter Canada (I’d booked last minute); now I reserve low cost lodging w/a 24 hr front desk to start any international trip with the most expensive lodging latter (refundable).  Figure “day 1” I’ll be taking a shower/napping post flight anyways.",IronyElSupremo,2025-04-23T10:53:57,2

"I agree that strict enforcement of this rule will hurt tourism. However, the US didn’t invent this practice.   The requirement of pre-arranged accommodations/lodging is required for tourists all around the world. If you visit Europe as a tourist, and you’re not a EU/EEA/CH citizen, you’re required to have pre-arranged lodging before entering or even before obtaining a tourist visa. Just look at Spain entry requirements.   The only reason European students have been entering the US without pre-booking hostels is because they’ve had privileged passports. Generally, if you come from a rich country, immigration police will be chill. However, if a Chilean were to go to Spain, that person would have to demonstrate their accommodation itinerary and proof of having sufficient cash just to enter.   Even as an American, I’ve been asked where I’m staying, requiring the exact address, when visiting South America. It is pretty damn standard and complaining about it is a little bit entitled.  I have never visited another country without having my lodging pre-arranged, be it friend’s place, hotel, AirBnb, etc. Heck, when I was a student in 2014 and went to Europe, staying in the stingiest hostels in Paris and Brussels, I pre-booked them to save money.  To reiterate, I’m not justifying the jailing and mistreatment of these girls. That is unacceptable. All I’m saying is that the denial of entry to a country for not arranging accommodations ahead of time is common. ",CLUSSaitua,2025-04-23T15:16:55,3
"Also they had made some reservations but as they were going to be in Hawaii for over a month, they wanted some flexibility so didn’t book everything yet. It’s not like they had no place to stay at all.",Jakemcclure123,2025-04-23T19:12:38,3

"You might get asked if you have accommodations, but I've never had it escalate if I said that I planned on finding something out in town.   Japan is one place I've flown to on multiple occasions without booking a hotel in advance, because I could just get a cheap capsule hotel or Internet cafe in any city I visit.  never had an issue.",kingofcrosses,2025-04-23T11:18:41,6

My nephew hiked the whole Pacific Coast trail.  He never stayed in a hotel.  He received any mail or supplied via USPS General Delivery along the route.  Who cares what the the “trail town” economies expect?,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-23T11:01:01,4

"Most now enjoy the trail towns “diversions” (.. aka beer and pizza), but “ecotourism” is now key in trying to keep tourist flows, keep rural economies afloat, etc..

"I've been asked exactly once. It's a common official requirement, but nobody really bothers with asking for proof of travel arrangements unless they're trying to give you a hard time or think you plan to overstay or some such.",account312,2025-04-23T11:57:09,2
"I've not been asked about where I was staying in country, but I have been asked about my return flight information in a very routine manner. ""Ah, I see here you're staying until the 16th?"" Yes. ""And are you returning to America or headed somewhere else on your trip?""   It never felt like I was being ""questioned by agents of the state"" but it was definitely a routine part of just the dozen or so questions you get asked while they process you through customs and stamp the forms. The only time I had anything go weird was also when I realized those routine questions were not just idle small talk with the agent at the gate, because I DIDN'T have a return flight booked and was instead leaving the country by boat so they asked for the boat's information, captain's name, itinerary, etc.   Even then, it was still handled quickly and efficiently once we knew what to put on the forms, but customs agents in most tourism destinations see dozens or hundreds of people per day so they make the questions and answer sections so smooth you don't even notice that they're extracting this information from you. It's just something they type into the computer to put on the forms, they stamp your passport and/or entry visa, and you're on your way to baggage claim.",theCaitiff,2025-04-23T12:20:22,1
"In 2017 when I traveled to Italy, I was asked if I had reservations, but I had planned ahead and had them printed out. I think if I wouldn't have had any info with me perhaps they would have asked an additional question or two.
