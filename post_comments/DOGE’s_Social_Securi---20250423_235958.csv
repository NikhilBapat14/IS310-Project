"The point isn't savings or efficiency, it is making those that depend on benefits suffer. This is a big distraction from the real focus of Musk, beyond his perverse love of cruelty inherent in his Nazi beliefs,  which is stealing all of our data.",Tballz9,2025-04-24T01:03:33,40

"If they don't still have their wits about them or children to help navigate the chaos, this could literally destroy some seniors. Missing just one month's check could be catastrophic to the quality of their lives. Musk should be tarred, feathered and run out of town on a rail for the SSA disaster he and his doggies will be leaving behind in their wake. And to think, they were paid six-figure salaries to do this. Lord only knows how much Musk's personal wealth increased from governmental contracts he's gotten since buying Trump a presidency.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T03:01:25,8

"**4 Million.** They moved 4 million SSA recipients to the Master Death File due to data entry errors, or the goons misinterpreted the data (I'm guessing the latter).  >These supposed dead are not to be confused with more than 6,000 living immigrants the Trump administration moved to the SSA Death Master File (DMF) in an attempt to force them to self-deport by depriving them of the ability to work legally. Many more American citizens were wrongly consigned to the DMF after Elon Musk’s DOGE goons bullied their way onto the SSA’s databases and mistakenly decided that “countless” people listed as 120 years old and older were receiving benefits.“\[DOGE staffers\] went into the system and they killed off people,” Glasgow told *The Daily Beast*. “***About 4 million people, they marked them as dead***. But they’re not sure if those people were supposed to be marked as dead, so they’re sending us an email saying, ‘If these people come into the office with their identification, you can reinstate them.’”The 55-year-old father of six added, “So we’re going to be resurrecting a lot of dead people.”",CletusCanuck,2025-04-24T08:06:35,3
