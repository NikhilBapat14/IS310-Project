Still won’t change their vote so who tf cares. Sucks for the conservatives in the area tho,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T17:19:31,8
"Gas in my area of CA which is normally on the low side, is just shy of $5 a gallon, for 87($4.80)... diesel #2, which is a bit in-between b20 and #2 is $4.60.  It has gone up a dollar in 6 months from a low after trumps election. From a very brief low...   All this to say... shit sucks. And the state, newscum in particular is responsible for a lot of our price woes...",thatfordboy429,2025-05-09T20:48:27,3

"They know they have enough of a hold on the media that any price increases can be blamed on Republicans, even when its an increase that's purely due to local or state regulations and taxes. The more expensive they make things, the more votes they get and the average democrat simply doesn't have the  brain power to connect cause to effect. ",Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-09T16:01:18,7

"CA is in the top 3 for republican turn out... the others being Texas and Florida, separated by a few hundred thousand, and 10s of thousand respectively(not a lot when we are talking 9 million. Also that's in a state where we know our vote doesn't mean jack. IF CA was remotely on the table I bet you would see that number jump mid/high 6 figures. All this to say. There are a lot who are stuck with this BS that are stuck.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-09T21:34:43,3
