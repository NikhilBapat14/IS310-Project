Future Former Defense Secretary,Big_Knobber,2025-04-22T15:26:32,151
"From reporter Ryan Grenoble:  Maybe Pete Hegseth should add Brian Kilmeade to some of his group chats.  Seeking to quiet rumors he’s not long for the job, the embattled defense secretary on Tuesday joined “Fox & Friends,” where co-host Kilmeade proceeded to introduce him as the “former” secretary.  In his rush to correct himself, Kilmeade then introduced Hegseth as the “current secretary of state” ― a role instead occupied by one Marco Rubio.

"Maybe he'll be Article 15'ed. Hegseth is a Fuckstick, muscle-beach, racist infantry bro, who got given, then turned power-stupid. Yet another Over promoted asswipe that maybe saw combat dictated by people who never expected him to finish schools, but still gets drunk and somehow finds the strength to lie. Nobody bases the standard of 'Warfighters' on what is capable of running the mission. He is why. Executive Branch, Defense Department, Penta- Godddamned -Gon, that piece of shit got a suit to wear to the party, and he deserves none of it, not even that bullshit tie. The orange asshole up top is an idiot, and everyone touting his blameless, forthright way of making changes are actually brainwashed by another criminal, albeit one who somehow has the golden key to make it all not matter too much. Hegseth is not necessarily a disgrace, but absolutely wrong for his job.

They can't use the first Signal story as their justification, at least not without implicating every important person in the Administration.   But the new story has Pete sharing the attack plans with people who don't even work for the government, and that's what they will focus on when they give him the boot. They can do that while still saying it's fine for government officials to use Signal, and also that no one shared any classified information on unauthorized platforms, so it is perfect for them. They probably went to Pete after the first Signal story dropped and demanded he tell them everything about his use of Signal so that they can be prepared, and now they are using what he told them to hang him.

Basically had to roll around half cocked all the time toeing the line between riding a steady buzz or losing my shit and getting tanked.
