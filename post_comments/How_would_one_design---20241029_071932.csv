"Here are a few important ways to prevent extremism and protect minority rights. I could get into more specifics if I had more time. There is a wrong way and a right way to implement each of these ideas.   1.  Remove money from politics. 2.  Appoint judges based on qualifications instead of party affiliation. 3.  Use ranked choice voting. 4.  Create rules, checks and balances to prevent corruption, e.g. gerrymandering districts, setting your own salary, ethics reforms, term limits.   Those measures will help, but I believe the real solution maybe transforming the government into a meritocracy.",Holiday_Clue_1403,2024-11-05T02:41:29,1
"Start by getting rid of democrats, that'll solve a lot of it. ",BreakfastBulky1344,2024-11-02T07:52:53,0
"Oh boy. I believe you mean well, but none of your ideas address discrimination or extremism even at their best.   Let me give you an example: you implement all these measures in a sundown town.   Immediately you find out that money is not the problem, because the majority of voters support discrimination anyway. You *may* even find out that some billionaires (let's say Soros) sponsored pro-equality candidates.  The judge is appointed based on qualification and strictly follows the law. Except the law is discriminatory.   And even with the ranked-choice voting KKK members won the mayorship, because it is a sundown city. Sure he won't put money in his pocket and will only serve 2 terms of 4 years. But he is still a KKK member.  The system you portray may be democratic and fair, your policies may even be good otherwise. However, these are not the policies that can solve discrimination.",Glif13,2024-11-07T12:55:33,1
"As I mentioned, all of the points I listed will to help, but here will always be some exceptions, and I'm not proposing a perfect solution. In several states in the US, gerrymandering is practiced as a way for the majority to hold onto power, thereby suppressing the minority. Yet, you state that none of my points would help even at their best. All of my points would help. Do you want a better government? Do you have a better idea?",Holiday_Clue_1403,2024-11-09T03:31:24,1
"I say that your points are perpendicular to the discrimination. They don't affect it.  With gerrymandering, the majority may be disproportionally represented (it also may be used to turn the minority into the majority in some cases). However, to hold power within the democratic system, the majority doesn't need gerrymandering; it is already the majority — it will just win most of the seats (especially in a fair system).   That is the thing you are missing: you conflate the majority rule with the absence of discrimination. I hope I demonstrated that one does not *per se* exclude the other.   That's why most ways of protecting minorities almost always restrict the majority in some way: for example by requiring a supermajority to change the Constitution, citizenship, or electoral law (which effectively means that a large enough minority can block the change), or by establishing that certain rights (like freedom of speech or fundamental human rights) can not be revoked even if 90% wishes to do so.   Broadly speaking: 51% can't vote to execute the remaining 49. In fact, 99% can't vote to execute the remaining 1% — that's when you can say that minority is protected.",Glif13,2024-11-09T14:49:58,1
"My points are deliberately not directly related with discrimination. I am answering the question about how to prevent the minority from the tyranny of the majority. The question never mentioned discrimination directly. As you mentioned, the majority can vote to execute the minority, however if there are checks and balances in place (one of my original points), a super majority is often required for the majority to enact a tyrannical law. This is where gerrymandering comes into play. As you mentioned it can give the majority a disproportionate number of seats, making it easier for the majority to enact extreme legislation. It has also at times given the minority the majority of seats.   I want to point in my original post, things like (eliminating) gerrymandering and separation of powers are points that help, but the true solution is a meritocracy (as I mentioned). It's not easy to create a meritocracy, and I've never seen a state do it, but it would solve the problem of tyranny from the majority.   I would like to know what you would propose as a solution.",Holiday_Clue_1403,2024-11-10T02:27:57,1
"""particularly in regards to protecting marginalised groups from demonisation, and preventing the tyranny of the majority"" — seems pretty direct to me: I struggle to imagine tyranny without discrimination.    A supermajority to amend the constitution is not part of checks and balances — checks and balances refer to mutual control by branches. And since gerrymandering works both ways it can't be attributed to either protecting minorities (as majority-minority congressional districts of the USA supposedly do) or overpowering majorities.   And since you pay so much attention to meritocracy then maybe you want to specify who is supposed to identify merits.  My solution? I wouldn't dare to say how to solve it. I would say that the most important feature should be deliberation — i.e. discussing before any decision is made to break up information bubbles. That tends to increase the amount of goodwill between people.  It would also help to have some laws that could break up potential factionalism.  For example by editing the parliamentary proceedings to switch from party-based appointment into committee to issue-based. I.e. instead of 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats in a budget committee, there should be 2 candidates put by the Austerity group, 5 by the balance group, 3 by the social spending group, etc. With MPs forming different groupings by different committees.   This kind of arrangement would allow minorities to gain more flexibility because if issues don't come as a package deal there is a greater chance that people would need minority voices for the adoption of their preferred policy. That hopefully could somewhat reduce isolation.   In addition to that switching the system to proportional may ensure that the minority opinion is at least represented in the parliament and can participate in delibiration.   I would go as far as to add observers from a few organizations of minorities to ensure that their voice is heard. And to make factionalism a bit weaker I would add that the status of the observer should depend on collected signatures and be available to any organization.",Glif13,2024-11-11T03:53:26,1
