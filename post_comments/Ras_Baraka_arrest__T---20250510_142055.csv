"Every time the Trump team accused the Democrats of weaponizing the DOJ, it was projection every time.",Agressive-toothbrush,2025-05-10T14:28:05,1
Abolish ICE.,Kroptokinsloaf,2025-05-10T14:28:21,1
"I dont see how these ""charges"" would stick. Protesting in front of a building is not a crime. Its just wasting resource",Pormock,2025-05-10T14:44:31,1
">""We will not tolerate assault against our ICE law enforcement agents. By members of Congress or anyone else,"" McLauglin wrote in the post on X.  That's right! This administration only tolerates assaults from very Pro-MAGA protestors on January 6th who showed support for MAGA in the form of pardons and praise for their loyalty when forcibly entering that federal facility!",postsshortcomments,2025-05-10T14:40:35,1
Having your opposition arrested. Trump's following the fascist playbook gifted to him by Putin. This is not who our country is; we're better than this. Fear doesn't equate respect. I doubt if America will ever be respected again — we will be reviled and detested.,invalidpassword,2025-05-10T14:37:53,1
"Is it an ICE fracas, or more than that?  Save you some time, it is more than a fracas.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-10T14:30:03,1
Do it. Give those democrats way more attention.,hobopopa,2025-05-10T15:01:03,1
Can't wait to see the great legal mind of Alina Habba in action!,Purple-Principle-805,2025-05-10T14:51:43,1
"Some newly hired - poorly trained ""agent"" wearing a face mask without identifying themselves with ID and a warrant. is going to have a really bad day if they keep this German SA stuff up. Stand Your Ground is a thing. Even legal green card holders have 2A rights. ICE needs to act responsibly using fully identified uniforms and marked vehicles with warrants.",williamgman,2025-05-10T16:20:13,1
Do it Trump....keep them in the news,HENMAN79,2025-05-10T16:02:31,1
"I just realized this could be a play to get budget bill passed, if they arrest Dem members of Congress even for a few hours they could rush to pass the bills when the Dems are down some members.",vriska1,2025-05-10T15:03:10,1

"Not sure how we accomplish that when he just dropped an order to add at least 20,000 more wanna-be cops to their numbers. It's not looking good for us.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-10T15:33:46,1
These cases will be dismissed. It’s the duty of Congress to provide oversight for the executive. Congress members providing oversight of a federal facility cannot be tresspassing.,m1j2p3,2025-05-10T14:47:42,1
"they don't need charges to stick, they need to make it known that you will be arrested and detained regardless of what the law says.",roastbeeftacohat,2025-05-10T15:16:09,1
This is who we are. If we want to be better than this we need to actually be better. We need change now. There is zero reason to respect this country as it is.   Every day some new story comes out showing how facism is in control of the country. Its disgusting what we have become.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-10T15:21:52,1
"Well, the facility does have a parking lot, so it lines up well with her expertise.",duct_tape_jedi,2025-05-10T17:11:40,1
