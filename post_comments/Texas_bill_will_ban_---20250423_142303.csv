"It is a limitation of freedoms and can be harmful to children.  For instance, my daughter is in 2nd grade.  In her elementary school there is a child who is special needs.  Every day that child wears a pink animal tail and some sort of ears.  I do not know why the child wears this attire every day, but I have seen nothing from them to indicate that it is because they believe they are a pink cat and I certainly don't think a special needs 8 year old is doing it out of some sexual desire.  I imagine that these things make the child comfortable and are coping type devices for the child and are beneficial to them in helping them feel safe and comfortable in the school.  So, should this child be banned from wearing this attire because of some stupid right-wing lie and conspiracy?  Should they be expelled from public school despite it not being a distraction or an issue at all?  I had a classmate years ago that would bark at other people.  He also was a bit special needs and it was a coping mechanism for him because of social awkwardness.  He in no way believed himself to be a dog and was not really pretending to be a dog, he was merely barking, usually in the hallways when being picked on.  Should he have been expelled because he was making a noise the Texas GOP doesn't approve of?",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-23T14:46:20,4
