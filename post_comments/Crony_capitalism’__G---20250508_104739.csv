"Political megadonor unironically complaining of cronyism.  I read it, he actually used that word.  Unfuckingbelievable.  This is pirates complaining about theft levels of insanity.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T17:15:37,1

"Our ""brilliant"" corporate folks saw the dollars signs and said ""where do I sign up"". Too stupid and drunk with power... Not realizing it was being signed at a dirt crossroads in Mississippi. If these corporations make it thru the next decade... There will be some high turnovers in those boardrooms by angry shareholders. Doesn't help us... But that's the pain they will feel.",williamgman,2025-05-08T13:49:51,2
