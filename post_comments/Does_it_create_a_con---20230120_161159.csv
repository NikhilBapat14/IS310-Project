"It happened in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. Not only did both sides have George VI as monarch, both armies were commanded by serving British officers. It was a weird war, but it was a war nevertheless.",cpast,2023-01-20T20:09:59,22
"Hi LPercepts,  Yes and no?  On the one hand it would create some degree of conflict because he has a constitutional responsibility to both of them to act as head of state, but on the other hand he's also expected to remain apolitical and not get involved as well, so practically it's unlikely he'd be forced to openly 'pick a side' between them.  Obviously it depends on the circumstances, but in a morally-ambiguous war, he'd likely try to act as a moderator and peace-broker, calling for an end to hostilities and in the meantime trying to prevent the conflict from escalating or violating the laws of war or human rights.  Have a lovely day",Corvid187,2023-01-21T07:47:23,9
Commonwealth doesn't mean having the UK's monarch as head of state.,ANewPope23,2023-01-21T00:40:43,-4
"> both armies were commanded by serving British officer  How does that work?  In any normal armed force, if two officers' units start fighting each other, don't they share a single commander-in-chief (like PoTUS for the US) or HQ (like the Pentagon) somewhere up their chain of command who would order them to stop?  And if they don't stop shooting at each other when asked, wouldn't they no longer be serving officers, but mutineers who would go home to a court-martial for failing to stop shooting when ordered?",white_nerdy,2023-02-03T16:12:22,1
"No, but Commonwealth realms, which are specifically highlighted in the post title, are countries that explicitly have Charles III as their monarch.",LPercepts,2023-01-21T00:45:18,10
"During the colonial era, the British Indian Army (which at the time included Pakistan) was essentially Indian troops under British officers. Indian officers were appointed and rose through the ranks over the years, but the top ranks were still held by British officers. When India and Pakistan became independent, the top Indian and Pakistani officers still didn't have the experience needed to fill top slots. Instead, they had British officers seconded for those roles until native officers could take over.  While the commanders were British, they were seconded to the national armies. Politics is complicated and they only had some ability to go against their national leadership, who could ultimately decide to fire and replace them if they wanted to. At the same time, they seem to have felt they could keep things more under control as advisors, so they didn't resign in protest.",cpast,2023-02-05T21:09:43,1
