"I think you have to be stupid to not think there’s corruption on both sides of the isle. Lobbying, and insider trading make corruption significantly more likely.   When you’re forced into picking a side, I have to go with the side that I find more aligns with my overall ideas and viewpoints.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-05-07T18:20:42,282
"Not a fellow conservative.....  But this is like good Bernie....there needs to be a functional opposition party in this country and idk...Bernie is a character. Guy has just been doing the same shit for like 87 years...I can respect that at least.

"I usually disagree with stuff that Bernie says, but in this case he has a point. However, the word “corrupt” is quite harsh. We think of corruption as downright criminal.  I thinks he’s implying that both parties have biases and agendas that may be to their personal or party’s advantage more than to the country’s benefit.",Slalom44,2025-05-07T21:38:31,8

"Bernie desperately tries to be the left-wing populist. Calling government corrupt is a populist rallying cry. He's a communist at heart, and Marxists know better than anyone the formula to invoke a revolution starts with rallying the masses against the government.  But then he betrays everything he says by virtue signalling to every 'marginalized' identity group. If he'd wholesale drop the identity politics, he'd appear to be much more of a representative of the working class. But he'd rather wave the pride flag than the American flag.  And for a fun fact, this is considered evidence by the democrat's intelligence committee that Russians influenced the 2016 elections: https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/6039834537179.pdf",BarrelStrawberry,2025-05-08T08:31:17,2

"The greatest trick the government played was convincing you that you have to do exactly that. If the people of this country realized that, together, the worst parts of government could be controlled by ""We The People"" like it should be; you wouldn't have to think that you need to ""Pick a side"".    Just as you think that you really get to pick who you vote for. You're given a hand selected list of choices that are all pre-approved by the uniparty. You don't choose shit.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-07T19:38:34,163
You have to be stupid to create a false equivalence and think that there's the same corruption on the side that wants to shrink government and push decisions down to lower levels vs. the one that is idealogically based around more and more top down control. If anything the main corruption that exists in the republican party is from top down democrats that infiltrated it to control their opposition.,day25,2025-05-07T21:28:01,-12
"So a couple things can be true at once.  1) he does genuinely care about giving Americans a good life. 2) he does personally profit from his position. 3) more specifically he trades on his socialist creds to further his personal position (in order to further his personal profits)  If it weren't for #3 I could respect the guy.  #1 is good, and I don't even necessarily have any problem with #2 (I'm not a socialist; other people's good fortune neither offends, nor harms me) I have no problem with someone personally profiting as a result of helping others, so long as they actually are helping others in the process.  A rising tide lifts all boats after all.  What I have a problem with is not living the rhetoric you speak.  Bernie has made his career, and continues to maintain it, by his rhetoric that doing what he's doing is bad.

I think it’s nearly impossible for the Republicans to go back to their old platforms now that Trump has formed the biggest coalition in politics.   Congress may appear slow but the real test will be whether they pass the massive tax cuts Trump and the people want.

">he’s a multimillionaire  >what makes you say that? >because he has multiple millions of dollars in net worth >honey, having multiple millions of dollars doesn’t make you a multimillionaire  Spotted another one of those pseudo intellectual reddit leftists infiltrating this sub and brigading.  Bernie is a slimey corrupt democrat politician, no different than the rest. He accepted so much money from pharma, and he has the gall to claim that he never received a dime from “pharma CEOs”. His wording may be technically correct, the money didn’t come directly from CEOs, but he still accepted the money and contributed to corruption.  Just today he went “I ain’t waiting in line at the airport! I’m going to get on my private jet!!” The supposed “man for the people” can’t be asked to get in line with peasants and protect the environment.
