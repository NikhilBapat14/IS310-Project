"Strongly disagree.  We know that Iran will overtly try to push the bounds and find a work around, and covertly still do what they can in secret to continue the search for a nuclear arsenal.   A bad deal is exactly that. BAD!  Either an ironclad deal, or turn the dial to 11 on sanctions and find ways to ostracize them from the rest of the word.  Period.    Even if things escalate, I highly doubt it would turn into a ground conflict.  Their Air Force is nearly a half century behind ours with decades old 4th gen fighters.   Navy consists of a handful of frigates a couple of smaller corvettes and about 60 various patrol boats.  As long as we don’t actually put boots on the ground, it’s a sure thing for air dominance, strike, electronic warfare and sea denial. There’s really no reason to put boots on ground when you have a house around their neck.",daspes1269,2025-05-01T20:12:24,6
"I tend to agree. But ultimately, we're damned if we do and damned if we don't.  If we attack, we might momentarily degrade the program, but 1) Iran will rapidly reconstitute it....and 2) They may already have the means to produce a bomb and our attack would give them the pretext.  On the other hand, inaction almost insures a nuclear Iran. Can we live with it?  My other concern is domestic.  If Trump is seen as getting us into another war in the Middle East, a lot of concerns over his psychological predispositions will be validated - justifiably or not. Such a war might be setting Republicans up for a major shellacking in '26 and '28....(conversely, if the results of the attack are resolutely in our favor, e.g., Iran abandons its nuke program...it could positively reinforce Republican prospects).  I'm intelligent enough to understand the problem on multiple levels and what our various options are. I'm NOT intelligent enough to know exactly what course of action we should take. I hope those in power are clear-minded...and can keep their eye on the big picture and the medium-to-long term.  Edit: One trap we shouldn't fall into is predicating our actions on internal Iranian dynamics. The so-called experts have been predicting the imminent collapse of the regime for 40 years....and it never happens. To NOT act for fear of upending an imminent overthrow of the mullahs would be absurd.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-01T19:20:24,3
