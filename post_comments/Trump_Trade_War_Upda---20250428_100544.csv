"I was thinking September but June is definitely a possibility. The constant tariff on, tariff off will eventually wreck the economy.",akd432,2025-04-28T10:09:36,32
"Sounds about right. Back in January/early Feb. I predicted that it would take 'til at least May to start feeling the impacts, but would really settle in and hit hard over the summer. We're talking empty shelves, high prices, and unemployment in the 7-8% range. Happy Fourth of July everybody!!!",mkt853,2025-04-28T10:13:18,13

The veteran market players keep telling smaller investment groups to stop with the Trump induced euphoria every time he says a nice thing.  They're not positioning for what's coming; they're positioning based off Trump's swings.

The last ships from China arrive on May 10. There are no ships sailing to the US currently that are expected to arrive after May 10.,kami246,2025-04-28T10:46:10,26
I doubt any country wants to do a deal with him now as he looks like he's going to cave....and no country wants to be stuck with a needless tariff after the event.,bickering_fool,2025-04-28T16:41:16,2
"> Happy Fourth of July everybody!!!  Hmm now I wonder if Trump will try to do an EO that makes illegal, dangerous fireworks legal everywhere and crow about patriotism or something.

"Shipping experts have been saying that the first week of May is when the final pre-tariff ships from China will arrive. After that, the ports will be a ghost town and it will get very bad.",Elendel19,2025-04-28T13:11:02,3

Because the market acts more like a school of fish or straight-up gambling.  It's predicting how other people will react instead of reacting yourself.  It's a game and follows game theory.  That strategy is breaking down *hard* when everyone appears lost and irrational.,SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-28T10:37:18,3

"Trump will find a way to declare victory and cut the China tariffs this week. He had a bunch of very rich and successful CEOs (the only kind of people he cares about) sit him down like a toddler and explain that their stores are going to be empty starting in early May. Even he can’t ignore something that bad and more importantly, extremely visible to all.",Elendel19,2025-04-28T13:09:45,9

"Rice, beans, and canned vegetables.",ArcaneMercury49,2025-04-28T12:32:21,10
"Non-perishables. Dry rice and beans together can make a complete protein and serve as a great backbone. Make sure you include small amounts of a variety of different canned foods, especially canned fish and canned fruits and vegetables.  Strong sauces both provide a lot of extra calories and can help make otherwise bland food more palatable when you are eating them a lot. So include some of them and some spices.  Best to try to have at least a month of water, but water is much harder to keep stockpiled than food because you need a lot of it. So also get a collapsible rain bucket and a filtered top. This will allow you to refill your stock of water fairly regularly.  Multivitamins are a great investment for when you are forced to live off of less than ideal food, and you should also stockpile any medicine that you can which you might need. But that last part is usually quite difficult. Best to at least get a little stockpile of over the counter stuff though.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T12:34:49,4
