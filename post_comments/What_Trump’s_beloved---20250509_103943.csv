"What used to be a three times a week visit to McDonalds dropped to zero right after he served fries out the window.    I haven't missed it, and I think I've lost weight because of not eating there.",kiltedturtle,2025-05-09T10:55:16,8
McDonald's is overpriced crap.  In-n-Out and local burger joints have much better food that didn't come from a tube of pink goo — for lower prices.,box-cable,2025-05-09T10:43:56,7

"""McDonald’s serves 90% of Americans every year"", at this point, it’s basically a functioning branch of government. They’re feeding the public, employing millions, and showing up in more towns than elected officials. Meanwhile, Congress can’t even agree on what day it is. Maybe we should let the guy in the drive-thru headset handle infrastructure next.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T10:59:03,1
