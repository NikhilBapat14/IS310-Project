"How can he be so dumb as to lie about trade discussions being held when China can call him out as a liar?  All this does is to reinforce the perception of his weakness and panic as pressures mount on him to resolve this crisis.  China has Trump and the USA by the balls and will not enter into discussions until the tariffs are lifted. Even after   lifting it will take the position of free trade with the US.  This extremely dumb trade war was lost by the US before it began. What has it achieved so far other than a weakening of the USD and bonds , rising inflation and unemployment ?",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-25T00:13:08,14

"Regardless of whether one likes or dislikes the policies and practices of China, the fact is that The People’s Republic of China treat foreign relations and diplomacy as an exact science. Their brightest and most experienced minds vet strategies through committees of the Communist Party weighing the political, economic and military aspects of every position taken. Compare that to the totally ad hoc and whimsical “strategy” of the Donald Trump administration and it’s not hard to see who will prevail.",blue_quark,2025-04-25T18:39:14,1
How do you start crap with the one country that holds 90% of all rare earth metals. Then your VP calls a billion people peasants and degrades their whole way of life. USA’s current political leadership put them in this position and there’s no way to reverse what’s been done.,rj319st,2025-04-25T01:00:04,11

">and make America regret electing the clown again  Pretty much yeah. It may sound mean but China wants stability. They don't want crazy Republicans behaving like the mob. It was America's job to not elect Trump a 2nd time let alone a first time. America fucked up so now it falls onto China to put Republicans in a time out. Unfortunately since they control USA right now a whole lot of people are going to get fucked here. Because the people in charge of USA have not gotten in trouble yet. USA had 4 years to get their shit together. Now, the rest of the world is getting their shit together and China doesn't have Trump or Republicans.",tech57,2025-04-25T11:38:58,2

"- when you have NO trust in a signed contracts and trade agreements and they are TORN up,  it is near impossible to restore. Trump's BUSINESS MODEL was to fuck contractors and suppliers as he always was able to bully them...the world is a BIG stage and actors like China will not submit to such tactics. They can have favorable trade agreements with the rest of the world which they are now fully pursuing and sit back and watch US economy crash and burn with popcorn in hand. We did this to ourselves and we only have us to blame...all those who sat out voting own this but we get the pleasure of enjoying it altogether. The only positives here? MAGAs are going to suffer way more as their dependency on GOVT programs is huge, most are clueless....but they will be soon educated.",decaturbob,2025-04-26T04:40:56,1
"Wait couple of weeks and you'll understand. Trump is not interested in middle and lower strata, because you already voted him to power. So now it's time for you to pay for his naive and moronic economic and political experiments. Foot is yours, it's still not hurt because of traumatic shock.",Livid-Perception4377,2025-04-25T06:22:23,3
"Isn’t it your foot too then ? What’s to understand, he’s a moron,only gonna get worse from here, Trump couldn’t negotiate anything all he has is American money,ain’t gonna save him with all the bridges he’s burning, the world is already moving on from American goods where they can, he has forever blighted any credit the states had built up over decades of diplomacy, totally will destroy everything, and look out 2028; you think he is gonna leave power quietly, he’ll no, get ready for the revolution.",Twoparrotparty,2025-04-25T16:31:41,1
