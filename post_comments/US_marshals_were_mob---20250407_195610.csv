Is it no longer hyperbolic that these agents are the neo-Gestapo now?,-prairiechicken-,2025-04-07T20:25:42,1
"And US marshals were also moblized to help DOGE get into different gov agencies and to protect Musk millions.   We basically don't have 3 branches but one branch only now. Congress is deemed useless because the power of taxation is taken away by the president by Tariffs. The power of declaring war is also taken away by the president as he can just bomb middle east. The power of enacting law is basically EO by president.   And the judicial branch is also useless too, because with US marshals completely under control, the rulings became ""if I want to follow I will, if I wanna defy I can"". situation.   And fed employees basically are all at will employees now. So the president = king.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T20:04:49,1
