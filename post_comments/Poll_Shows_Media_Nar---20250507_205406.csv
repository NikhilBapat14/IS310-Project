Here is something that simply does not exist.   A Trump voter who wishes they voted for Kackling Kamala.  ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-07T20:59:16,68
"***Holy constant reposts Batman.*** As I said in the other iterations of this, Dems aren't past the denial state of grief yet.  ""Do you regret voting for Trump?""  No, just like April just like March just like February just like January just like December just like November. Just like June just like July just like August just like September just like October.   As a matter of fact the first time I ever took Trump seriously as leader material was when I saw TVLand's desperate scramble to send everything anything *madeupthings* just to try and stop Trump's entry into politics - back in **2015.**  Seeing the mainstream lose its monopoly on public influence was like watching a galaxy-sized kid having his iPhone taken away.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T21:11:48,23
My whole family is conservative. Most of my friends are conservative. I’ve never met a single conservative that has expressed any kind of “voter regret”. Concerns about how some things have been handled so far? Sure. Regret? Never  edit: spelling,Shadow_9-3,2025-05-08T02:05:00,7

"Color me shocked (not).  Seriously the left just keeps grasping at straws. They truly can’t fathom that yes, this is what we voted him in for and that we like and generally approve of most of the things he is doing.",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-05-08T04:49:59,5

"I wonder where the media is getting their information from. Must be pulling it straight from their asses, because I don't know a single Trump voter who regrets their vote.",DeathTheSoulReaper,2025-05-09T08:03:32,1
"They’ll conduct a poll on verify the majority of Americans like air.   To regular folks, *except* for the rabid left this isn’t a revelation.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T20:57:35,-1
It really lays bare the lie that the media is unbiased🙂‍↕️,indefiniteretrieval,2025-05-08T04:39:44,4

"I don't know, there is probably a drunk lib out there somewhere who cast the wrong ballot and is now facing an existential crisis.",Rush2201,2025-05-08T06:38:15,1
"The only thing I regret is not buying the dip when Trump literally told us to.  I ended up losing a good chunk of my savings because I inexplicably trusted the media about the ""freefall"". What a wake-up call.",Clint_East_Of_Eden,2025-05-07T22:58:48,9
