"What a disconnect you've got going in the US. Trump and Project 2025 want Americans to have more children, but are doing everything they can to make that goal prohibitive. And a one time check for $5000 isn't going to cut it.",biscuitarse,2025-04-25T14:35:40,16

"Oh you can bet most people aren’t even going to get those checks either. Plus, people who’re going to be motivated by these checks to have children are definitely not the best sort of individuals to raise these children. We’re going to see a hell of a lot more parental neglect and abuse in this country in the coming decade.",Full_Maintenance_252,2025-04-25T15:14:11,3
"The Republicans think they can force everyone to do what they want. Like, if the Republicans ban birth control, people will have more children they can't afford.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-25T15:11:10,2
"Ikr?  It totally cracks me up when republifascists complain no one wants to work because they're living off $1200 from almost six years ago.  So out of touch, but it's Dems who are perpetually blamed for alienating the working class...",utriptmybitchswitch,2025-04-25T16:41:04,1
