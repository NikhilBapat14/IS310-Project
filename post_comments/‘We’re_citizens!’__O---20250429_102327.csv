"I know I’m missing parts of the whole story but can someone explain how the draining of the savings account went? So here’s a breakdown of how I was told the story.  ICE has a search warrant for this home in Oklahoma and maybe arrest warrants for who they believe lived in the house.  The house is now occupied by new homeowners so ICE ends up essentially detaining perhaps arresting and whatever else tragically happened to the family.  So ICE goes inside ransacks the house and of course identifies the family members. So my first question right there is if the family was identified and not the people ICE was looking for how did they get permission to drain their savings accounts? Like how does that process work? Especially if you know you have the wrong people.  It’s terrifying that the police/ICE can just arrest/detain the wrong people and be like  “FUCK we got the wrong people, oh well I guess their savings account will have to do!”",rerun_rewind,2025-04-29T23:49:07,1
"These mistaken identity raids are so disturbing for a number of reasons. They demonstrate that these agents are thugs that dehumanize anyone not like them, that many of them don't actually know what they're doing, that they will not back down even when proven wrong, and worst is that they send the message that Trump and his goon squads have the right to enter anyone's home at any time for any reason even if made up and take anything away from them. They can even send you to CECOT and make up a story afterward as with Garcia. It's starting to seem like these raids are either intentional random acts on innocent civilians or if unintentional they are still wins for the administration by instilling everyone with a deep sense of fear of the state and that even obeying the law and them doesn't mean you can't also lose everything.",Martag02,2025-04-30T06:52:15,1

"It might be an unpopular thing to say on Reddit, but I think that even though Trump followed Hitler’s path to power, he’s going to be following Stalin’s model for staying in power. This generally means mass imprisonment over death camps (giving people the *hope* that they’ll see their families again from the gulags is better at keeping them in line). Also, generally fewer arbitrary killings, since the Nazis killed people for who they were (like race or sexuality), whereas the Stalinist Soviets tended to kill people for what they’ve said or done. Again, it’s overall more effective at keeping people in line since they figure if they keep their heads down and mouths shut, the state will ignore them.   Note: I am well aware that there were genocide committed by the Soviets, like the hideous Holodomor. Ethnic cleansings were perpetrated by the Soviets in the furtherance of other goals, whereas for the Nazis, the genocide was more or less the goal in and of itself.",KinkyPaddling,2025-04-29T16:13:58,34

"Unfortunately, ICE warrants can and oftentimes are signed by judges and do hold up in a court of law IF they are implemented properly. If it was signed by a judge and was the correct warrant (specifically search and seizure of property and not a deportation warrant), the issue is the unnecessary use of force in the search and the lack of proper investigation into the current resident before searching the property.  Again, the point is that none of what happened is acceptable and there should be some form of recourse for what happened to this family, but we also shouldn't spread misinformation. Especially if said misinformation could be dangerous for the communities that are most affected.",RabbitInfamous271,2025-04-29T14:28:34,7

"That's an interesting take — and I think not far off. It is a little hard talking about this without sounding like we're making some moral equivocations or diminishing historical atrocities. Robert Paxton lays out five stages of fascism — we're in stage four right now where fascists have taken power and are exercising it to reshape government and society. Stage five is radicalization or entropy. Radicalization is extreme and intensifying violence aimed at internal cleansing and external expansion. Entropy is when the state reaches a banal authoritarianism that limps along, imprisoning dissent, punishing enemies, corrupting institutions with bribery and cronyism, but without the extreme violence of death camps or war. I think an argument can be made that Stalin leans slightly toward the entropy side of authoritarianism despite the horrors inflicted by his government. It is much more sustainable long term compared to constant and total war.",Kid_Serious,2025-04-29T16:22:26,14
