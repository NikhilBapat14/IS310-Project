Party headed by child predator seeks to protect other child predators.  Unsurprising.,VanceKelley,2025-05-06T11:28:58,45
No one defends child abuse and pedophiles with such fervor quite like rightwingers.,MrLurid,2025-05-06T11:29:34,20
"""In a news release, the Justice Department called the law “anti-Catholic,” citing the law’s lack of exemption for Catholic priests.""   WTAF? So Catholic priests should not have to report abuse? What is the constituency here? I am genuinely curious whether Catholics would think it's ok for a priest to know about abuse and do nothing.",Kincherk,2025-05-06T11:39:58,20

"My favorite is the video of pedo Don looking at a 10 year old and saying, *""I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?""*",Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-05-06T11:32:18,7
"Pope Francis made it a church law that Priests have to report any abuse going on in the church to both the church and law enforcement, or face ex-communication and being reported to the authorities themselves for engaging in a cover-up.  It's not ""anti-Catholic"" it lines up perfectly with church doctrine.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-06T11:56:37,13
"Confession is supposed to be between the priest and the Confessor.  That said, idgaf, there should be NO exception to reporting sexual abuse of children.   If that means pesos dont get to Confess and are doomed to hell, so be it.",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-06T11:56:20,3
"Yes, thank you! I was saying that I actually think he’s more qualified to be the pope, given his experience covering up child sexual abuse",beadzy,2025-05-06T13:10:12,2

Yet the abuse continues like wildfire. It’s almost as though abusers operate within the church but have no loyalty to its principles,beadzy,2025-05-06T13:11:57,5
">Confession is supposed to be between the priest and the Confessor.  The Pope decreed otherwise. This law doesn't even cause a rift between law enforcement and the church, because they're both in agreement of what should be done.  This is pure and utter grandstanding.",jabrwock1,2025-05-06T12:48:06,6

>Yeah but he ded tho  The decree updated papal law. A new pope would need to explicitly rescind that law.,jabrwock1,2025-05-06T13:10:02,1
they are gonna vote one in that will.,Strict-Pain5154,2025-05-06T16:58:13,1
"The front runner is less progressive, but still considered a liberal by most papal standards. It's unlikely he'd go ""yeah that wasn't working out, go back to hiding the pedos"".",jabrwock1,2025-05-06T17:07:23,1
