"If you add this to HR 1526 - the NORRA Act - a bill designed to stop federal judges from issuing nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional overreach, you have a combination of bills that gags the courts and unleashes partisan lawyers to wage lawfare on behalf of political actors.   [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1526](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1526) (Already passed the House)     Is there a subreddit that just tracks bills and discusses their implications within the session/era in which they were submitted? These are power grab bills designed to cement that power indefinitely and weaponize our institutions against us.",vucubcame,2025-05-07T10:06:07,17
">To protect State and Federal courts' primary and inherent authority to regulate and oversee the legal profession by prohibiting Federal agencies from regulating licensed attorneys and law firms engaged in litigation activities, prohibiting opposing parties in legal actions from bringing private rights of action against such attorneys and law firms for their litigation activities, and for other purposes.   First half of the title of the bill sounds okayish, the second half is insane though. Basically this sounds like the law firms that offered a billion in free services will have protection from any litigation if this passes. Are Republicans just stacking up tons of bills in the house / senate to then have a day of reckoning to push as many as through as fast as possible? Ive seen bills for dismantling OSHA, DOE, etc..  Definitely let me know if I am wrong about the understanding of the title of the bill, and im curious of peoples thoughts on if said day of reckoning could be slowed down? I realize filibustering is a thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way around that.",BureMakutte,2025-05-07T10:07:12,6

"If there is no upholding of the Constitution, how can there be argumentation relating to the Second Amendment?         And if the Supreme Court has granted Executive Immunity then, syllogistically, Soveriegn Immunity has no check by Soveriegn Responsibility.",gdwyer23,2025-05-07T10:11:15,3
"I’m working on a simple tool to help small law firms and legal assistants automate client intake — things like forms, document uploads, and scheduling.  You seem like someone who might know a bit about this space. Could I ask:  * How do you currently handle intake? * Is anything about it frustrating or slow?  I’d love 5 minutes of your honest feedback — no sales pitch, just research for something I’m building.  Thanks a ton!",Civil_Medium8685,2025-05-09T19:43:07,1

"I could see that, but I was thinking a subreddit where you might open it, and all you would see are links to bills and the first comment explaining who submitted it, where it is in the process, what it is, and then an introductory paragraph that explains its implications.      Then the rest of the comments could be back and forth with nuance and discourse on what effect it will have on the country.",vucubcame,2025-05-07T10:11:25,3
Be the change you want to see. Otherwise r/law is the place. Good luck with the nuance on these subjects though.,SirenSongShipwreck,2025-05-07T10:37:19,3
