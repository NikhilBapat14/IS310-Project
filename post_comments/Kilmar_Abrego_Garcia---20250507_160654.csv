"Asking objectively (if that’s possible on this topic): if the judge’s order that he can’t be deported back to El Salvador was based on the potential threat to his life due to gang violence, and gang violence has been essentially eliminated in El Salvador since then, why was that order still in effect at the time of his deportation (even if it was ignored)?",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-05-07T16:16:35,0

"> Right, but I’m asking why wasn’t it lifted years ago when the threat was gone?   Just from a bit of googling it's not clear to me that the gang that was targeting him (Barrio 18) is ""gone."" Weakened, but not gone.   But suppose the threat is gone. He was here legally, married to a US citizen, had two children who are citizens, had a valid work permit and was working, and was complying with the reporting requirements, so what would have triggered a review and a hearing to determine whether the previous court order should be removed? What would be the motive for doing so? (I don't mean the Trump administration's motive, that's clear enough, I mean a motive that isn't morally repugnant.)  > Or why wasn’t his asylum request approved then (in 2019) if the judge deemed the threat serious enough to issue the order in the first place?  From what remember the asylum request wasn't granted because he missed a deadline, so he got ""asylum-lite"" that gave him a valid work permit but not a path to a green card.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-07T17:39:13,1

"> An indefinite work permit seems like the judge was looking for loopholes for him.  The status the judge gave him isn't a loophole. It's a provision that's in the law, and one that requires stronger evidence than asylum.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-08T04:49:33,1
But a work permit is meant to be temporary right? Additionally why even bother issuing the order (supposed to be) preventing him from being deported back to El Salvador if there was stronger evidence that would permit him staying permanently? Why not just say he can’t get deported at all?,Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-05-08T07:24:15,1
"The evidence justified an alternative to asylum which would let him stay permanently. The court order did say he can't get deported. And I haven't seen anything to suggest that the court order, or the work permit it allowed him to get, are not meant to be permanent, just like asylum. The court order wasn't conditional on conditions in El Salvador continuing to be dangerous for him, or anything else afaik (other than the reporting requirements, etc., which he was doing).  We gave someone who escaped a dangerous environment a chance to build a life here. This is a good thing.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-08T08:51:45,1
">This is a good thing  I couldn’t agree more, don’t get me wrong, but I just think there isn’t much clarity on why he was given this “asylum-lite” treatment. Was the idea to keep having him renew that work permit every few years? Clearly he was here to stay by 2019, but he should’ve been elligable for a green card due to being married to a US citizen. It seems like he was in an immigration gray area.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-05-08T10:40:58,1
