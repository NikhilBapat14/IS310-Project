"Well, ripping families apart was one of tRump's greatest and proudest hits during his first malevolency... is anyone surprised by the sequel?   Aside from the abhorrent behavior he embodies, a deeper story here is that so many people expressing shock at his actions just refuse to see that **the cruelty is precisely the point of all this**... the firings, the verbal attacks, the glee with which he inflicts suffering on the weakest among us - all of it is meant to drive anyone who opposes his actions into disabling apoplexy.  Even more troubling in all this is that substantial minorities of ""true Americans"" and ""Devout Christians"" - the ones fully in the MAGAt camp - are true believers in his malignant vision. Though I would love to believe that those depraved souls might be saved, history tells me that that's just not in the cards... they are already condemned to the hell of their sick beliefs.  So we (the sane ones, I contend) are left with a choice of two paths - one, to let the angst and apoplexy control us and keep us screaming, yelling, rage-posting, and calling out every evil thing we see... or two, to redirect our horror, disgust, and energy toward building a massive electoral rejection of tRump's depraved vision of and for America.  I get the allure of the first path, and have been there, done that... but that path will, at best in these times, yield an occasional moral victory but can only stop a small part of the flood. That latter choice, however, is the choice that holds the only real prospect for success in the larger scheme of things. And so - go ahead and make appropriate rage post occasionally, but mostly, volunteer now, start organizing now, start direct participation now - that may give us a chance.",phosdick,2025-04-26T08:44:15,3

"The majority did either ask for this *or* didn’t care enough to vote against it.  It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but there’s no getting around the fact that this was a choice made by our countrymen. Of course it doesn’t mean *all* Americans are evil or unfathomably stupid, but it was not just some small minority that did this. It’s much more comforting to think that this is something we’re going through against our will collectively and without individual blame, that it was a mistake that people regret, etc., but no - our neighbors and coworkers and acquaintances heard Trump saying *exactly* what he planned to do, and they still went out to vote for him or didn’t bother voting at all because they didn’t care.  Super rough numbers, but just for illustration: let’s say the country has 350 million people, but 100 million can’t vote for some legitimate reason (they’re under 18, incarcerated, undocumented, etc). Could be off by a decent bit but you get the point. Roughly 77 million people voted for Trump, 75 million for Harris.  That would mean 75/250 = ~30% voted *against* the current admin, and ~70% voted for it *or* just shrugged their shoulders and couldn’t be bothered.   Idk about you, but at least for me that’s the biggest thing that prevents me from seeing a future here anymore. France’s Europe minister, Jean-Noël Barrot said it well: “we cannot leave the security of Europe in the hands of voters in Wisconsin every four years”. I feel the same way - it’s hard to bet my family’s long term wellbeing on a handful of swing voters who’ve shown themselves willing to trade the entire constitution for empty promises of <10 dollars a month saved on gas or eggs, or who are too lazy/stupid to get off the couch for a couple of hours every four years to do their civic duty.",james_d_rustles,2025-04-26T13:00:41,1
