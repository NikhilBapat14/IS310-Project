"**From reporter Lee Moran:**  Critics let rip on President Donald Trump after he admitted to a reporter on Thursday that he doesn‚Äôt even know the person he has nominated to become America‚Äôs top doctor.  Trump was asked why he wanted physician-turned-anti-vaccine wellness influencer Dr. Casey Means as U.S. surgeon general, given that she‚Äôs not practicing medicine and didn‚Äôt finish her residency.  ‚ÄúBecause Bobby thought she was fantastic,‚Äù the president replied, referring to Means‚Äô fellow anti-vaxxer with whom she has close ties, the Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs highly ‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs a brilliant woman who went through Stanford and as I understand it, she basically wanted to be an academic as opposed to a surgeon,‚Äù Trump continued of Means.  Trump reiterated that Kennedy ‚Äúreally thought she was great.‚Äù  But he confessed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her. I listened to the recommendation of Bobby. I met her yesterday and once before. She‚Äôs a very outstanding person, a great academic, actually, so I think she will be great.‚Äù  Social media users slammed Trump over the admission.

"This is what I fear the most right now: Trump is deteriorating mentally and the cadre of brain rot fascists around him are learning this and will shift to use him as a vehicle to carry out their plans (project 2025 and more). To this end, they‚Äôll use him as a mechanism to stage an overthrow of our democracy.",Potential_Category28,2025-05-10T18:08:47,1

"I'd guess it's kinda like the Nazi high command. His cabinet run things. They occasionally ask him for permission by saying 'this policy will make you look amazing.' Sometimes they just hand him executive orders.  And at the same time, Trump wants them to hate and spar with each other, so who gets the power is chaotic. And he always wants credit.  It would be insanely disturbing to actually see what he does all day.",GoodIdea321,2025-05-09T15:44:33,15

That he must be ill and all the ‚Äúvultures‚Äù are just deceiving him.
