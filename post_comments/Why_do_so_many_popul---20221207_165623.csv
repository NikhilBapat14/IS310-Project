Because populism distrusts mainstream. Its inherent in populist ideology that the status quo and its legitimate institutions are inherently illegitimate. Therefore a “corrupt” individual is simply acting out in an already corrupt regime or society.,[deleted],2022-12-08T06:57:26,29
"This is deeper than politics. It’s human psychology. Basically, human beings are absolutely incredible at telling convincing lies but quite mediocre at detecting them. Yet, most people refuse to believe that, thinking they can spot a lie easily. Confirmation bias feeds into that belief. People recall all the times they caught someone in lie but are, of course, oblivious to all the lies they fell for. As for how that ties into corrupt populists, the easiest way to win mass appeal is to tell lies that appeal to the masses, and since the public is bad at detecting lies, it’s generally a successful strategy.",blankblank,2022-12-08T08:13:36,13
"They are often ‘new to the game’. Leaders in established parties are just as corrupt, but are better at hiding it.",[deleted],2022-12-08T07:57:52,9
"Very simply put, we've gotten pretty good at creating political structures that create effective feedback loops and other mechanics to keep politicians directed properly. Actual, real, bribes-for-policies corruption is actually probably at its lowest point in history in most systems. Even in the US, where money is a form of political engagement, a politician working with a super PAC isn't actually corruption. Super PACs do represent voter interests to at least a certain extent, and folks railing on the ""corruption"" of for example Manchin supporting legislation friendly to coal business instead of environmentalism ignore that lots of voters prefer coal companies to environmentalism.  So when we see a politician that is directly eschewing the ""rules"" and looking outside the normal establishment of politics, they're also looking outside the structures we have to keep politicians in line. That means that there's a greater chance that they are gaining prominence through alternate methods, or that they are doing something different in a way that our system tries to discourage because it tends to lead to corruption. ""The establishment"" is what keeps our politics professionalized.  If a politician is able to successfully build a following without going through the ""normal"" channels, then often the ""normal"" people don't like them as much. The professionals in politics don't appreciate when someone is successful outside of the structures in place to ensure quality, conduct, etc. So if the professionals aren't there, then that support has to come from somewhere, and that is often from the ""common"" folk.  This is why for many populists, the reckless disregard for rules isn't seen as a bug, but as a feature. It's built into the process for this person to be successful.  That's of course a VERY brief oversimplification. There are books that are written about this topic. But if we want to distill a complicated answer into a couple paragraphs, we're going to have to talk in VERY broad strokes.",mormagils,2022-12-08T09:14:25,3

"Because when people say ""populist"" they mean ""popularist"". What's the difference? A popular idea isn't necessarily an idea for the people. People mistake that a lot.",MayUrShitsHavAntlers,2022-12-08T06:58:30,-5
"I don't think it's so much that people love populists for acting corrupt (I'd even consider that worth arguing about) as much as it is people like populists for acting corrupt *and being open about it.*  I think the vast majority of people, on some level, expect a government or a person within a government to be corrupt at *some* level. Maybe it's small potatoes like getting parking tickets waived or something big like a billion dollar deal with kickbacks but corruption is just expected behavior on the part of government or civil servants.   What sets a populist apart is when they do this and just outright admit it. Part of the expectation of corruption is that people will lie about it and cover it up. If someone comes out and says ""Yeah, I took bribes, so what? We all do."" that feels refreshing to a lot of people. They don't condone the corruption but they like that they're not having smoke blown at them.",HeloRising,2022-12-09T07:35:22,1
"People forget that corruption serves a purpose beyind enriching its perpetrators. Populism is a very dificult term to define, but as others have said it usualy invovles a complete distrust of the the ""system"". Others have said that a populist can act corrupt becouse they are ""honest about it"" i don't think that is exactly right. Populist supporters beleive that the normal institutions of the state are refusing to give ""them"" (the people) what they deserve. The populist politicans promises to support ""the people"" through non-traditional means. Thus corruption is not prceived a ""the politican encriching themselves"" but rather as the ""the politican subverting the normative insititution to support ""the people"".  Succesfull populists often are actually able to establish patronage netwroks that  help common people, to a certain degree. A good example of this was the Eva Peron Foundation in Argentina in the '40s. The foundation was a way for the Perons to move money around and hide it from foreign tax collectors, it also did actually give a lot of money to working class people. The ""people"" will perceive any attempt by the normative institutions to reign in this corruption as the ""elite"" cracking down on ""the people""  Of course, most populists never really do end up helping the ""common people,"" but I still think this is the implicit promise. When Donald Trump says ""it's smart"" that he cheats on his taxes, its not just that his supporters like that he is honest. They think that means he is going to ""cheat on their behalf.""",loselyconscious,2022-12-10T12:44:48,1
"What you might consider is that all politicians are 'corrupt'.  So the real difference is that the populists represent outsider interests that haven't yet managed to wield enough political power to make their particular brand of corruption legal.  Now, that's not to say that we need to make every new innovation in corruption legal. But if you look closely at what all those insider politicians are doing, it's pretty easy to find examples of ""why is *that* legal?"".",ViskerRatio,2022-12-11T10:14:34,1
