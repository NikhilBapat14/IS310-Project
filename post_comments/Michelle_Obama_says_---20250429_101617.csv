Surely she would sleep better if she could house and protect and share some of her wealth with them.,triggernaut,2025-04-29T10:18:12,128

Good. She should be afraid that one day she and her husband will pay up for destroying race relations in the country.,dankhorse25,2025-04-29T10:46:53,47
"Don't underestimate the TDS fear mongering.  I'm first generation American.  My parents and aunts and uncles all immigrated here with my grandparents, on both sides, as children.  They are cancelling trips out of the country out of fear of not being allowed back, even though they all got their citizenship back in the fifties, have up to date federally-issued passports, and have never committed any crimes in their lives.  Doesn't matter how many times I tell them there is a huge difference between their 70+ year old retired asses and known ms-13 members.  They are not in danger of being retained and deported or prevented from coming back in the country from a vacation to Canada or England or Poland.    The TDS is unbreakable.",Shadeylark,2025-04-29T11:17:16,22

Blaming Trump for her midnight snack binges.  There‚Äôs a real word for this:  Blaming someone else for your problems is called deflection. It‚Äôs a defense mechanism intended to preserve your self-esteem by painting yourself as the victim of circumstance rather than accepting responsibility for your own mistakes and your own behavior.,jackdog20,2025-04-29T22:56:41,3
"What a phoney baloney. She wasn‚Äôt there to help the poor Venezuelan immigrants who showed up in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard several years ago from getting ‚Äúdeported‚Äù off the island and relocated to Cape Cod.

"It's revisionist history. They will make no comment of it, the MSM will make no comment of it, the democrats who remember will make no mention of it. Therefore, it's as if nothing ever happened.  It's the same thing as trying to convince people that his only scandal was wearing a tan suit.

My relatives respect and fear the law.  Criminals do not.  It is the nature of criminals to not fear the consequences of their actions... That means they are not afraid... They are angry.  Where my relatives are scared and timid... The criminals are angry and hostile.  Which shouldn't stop us from doing what is right... But it does mean that we need to be prepared to have incidents.,Shadeylark,2025-04-29T19:22:48,8
