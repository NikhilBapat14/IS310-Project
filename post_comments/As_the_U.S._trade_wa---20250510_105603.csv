There goes the mid west's  LNG. I hope it's not cold this winter. It's baffles me what people will vote for just to be openly racist.,NoReserve7293,2025-05-10T11:10:04,1

Quebec has long opposed having a pipeline going through it and that needs to be respected although under the current atmosphere that could change. All said though it could get the a pipeline through Ontario and ship from there. Either way it's going to be looked at.,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-10T11:26:08,1
As our newly minted Prime Minister said in his acceptance speech (paraphrased): our special relationship with the US is over.  We’ve learned our lesson. There’s no going back now. You can’t threaten a country’s sovereignty and expect it to trust you. Sorry.,sharp11flat13,2025-05-10T15:41:45,1

The terminal should go in Ontario in Thunder Bay.  No pipeline to Quebec required.  They could also stockpile gas there during the winter.   Exactly as they do/did with grain shipments.,dendron01,2025-05-10T12:13:19,1
