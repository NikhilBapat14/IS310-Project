"Trump realizes that the majority of the country in the world does not support his position on the Russian /Ukraine conflict. This is another instance of Trump making a move or making a decision and finding out it is wrong and then backing down.   First he supported Ukraine then he backed Russia now he seems to have swapped his position again. This is just like his handling of the tariff situation. The tariffs are on then they‚Äôre delayed then they‚Äôre on again then they‚Äôre delayed again then they‚Äôre on and they‚Äôre off. He flips flops on so many different issues. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Don‚Äôt forget his one campaign interview where he said he would probably not have time to golf at all. In his first three months in office, he‚Äôs golfed at least 12 times at a cost of over $3 million each time. Then there‚Äôs the issue of deporting. The Maryland man were first they said he was affiliated with violent gangs back home then they said they made a mistake. Now they came up suddenly with pictures of supposedly the man‚Äôs tattooed knuckles (photo shopped ).   The only thing Trump is consistent about is lying. Like his lies about prices going down. I shop with Instacart and I can go back over a year and look at my receipts. I went and selected the exact same items from roughly 5 months ago to do a comparison. I purchased the exact same items and the price was $28.36 more expensive and some of the items I bought this time were actually on sale.
