"How's your 401k?    edit: maga is dead silent on the crashing economy. They were telling stories of selling their childrens toys, ivermectin factories and vacation homes for egg money because Biden. What's going on, you guys? How's business? Those ports are looking a little empty. I've called some of the maga businesses on the maga registry and it sounds down right apocalyptic. Why did you guys want to do this to yourselves?",mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-28T13:32:44,47
My Aunt is married to a tRump supporter and he's a truck driver.  Him losing his job would be the funniest shit ever.  We largely avoid him at this point (including his wife) but family gatherings might be extra entertaining if he comes begging for money again.  I might buy actual boot straps and give them to him.,Richfor3,2025-04-28T13:55:14,28

"We book a beach vacation every year with friends of ours, either Sandbridge, VA Beach or the Outer Banks. They could not commit last fall due to some medical issues which meant the trip wasn't happening as everything books by Thanksgiving for the following summer.

For four years I had to listen to my MAGA step dad rage about how his 401K was now a “201K” when Biden was in office. Now all the sudden he hasn’t said jack shit about his 401K or stock market. I’m so tired of the jackassery from these lunatics.,bonafidehooligan,2025-04-28T16:45:46,7
