"""If we just move further right surely some Republicans will break ranks and vote Democratic!"" think Democrats after a half century of this never working.   Seriously this, ""Lets do Reaganomics but call it abundance"" movement is so frustrating.   Democrats just stand up and actually push back please!   We don't have to talk about how Reagan would be embarrassed by Trump or about how money will actually trickle down this time.   Neoliberalism and Reagan led us step by step to Trump! And moving to the center doesn't work, if you get more Republican, guess what? Republicans will still vote Republican!   Tax the Rich 90% on every penny earned over 5 million dollars! Stand up for immigrants! Support carceral reform! And take power the executive branch has stolen from the legislative branch back!",NYSRSI,2025-05-08T15:34:18,-3
The abundance movement is not new. It is neoliberalism repackaged. It has failed us and led us here. This House Democrat is praising the caucus for being bipartisan already. This is a classic example of completely misunderstanding the moment.  Edit: Lol. It seems neoliberals don’t want to own this. If anyone wants to jump over to those subs you’ll see responses to this exact article such as “IT’S FINALLY HAPPENING.” and “The days of our party being taken over by the extreme left are done.”  It’s amazing how many of you don’t want to own your ideology.,TheSpiritsGotMe,2025-05-08T14:49:15,-2
Do you guys even read anything anymore? It sounds like you copy paste the same message regardless of what the subject is.,Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-08T16:50:58,8

"It's kind of direcly about this bipartisan caucus aimed at getting Democrats to work with Republicans to further erode regulatory protections and push supply side economics.  I disagree that that is a good plan because supply side economics, famously Reaganomics, don't help us working class people at all. And like I also disagree with Democrats who are focused on bipartisanship right now because the Republicans are pushing a cruel and fascist agenda.  So I think Democrats should not support either of these things and focus on economic solutions that would actually help, like taxing the rich at the same rate we did in 1950. Also they should stop trying to cater to Republicans and stand against them on other issues like immigration.  And I guess other people agree with that if you are seeing a lot of similar takes. So that's cool its like democracy and coalition building in action.",NYSRSI,2025-05-08T17:13:01,-2

"Oh is that the whole platform?   Right now we are slashing programs and regulations across the board. The opposition to regulations broadly and the call to get rid of red tape in the energy sector is not the route I would go. Deregulation is a main tenet of Abundance ideology. The Democrats signing onto the ideology are centrist neoliberals. The caucus referenced in the article as being inspired and motivated by ‘Abundance’ is Republicans and centrist democrats. So, sorry I guess. But if a donkey looks like a donkey and acts like an ass, I’m not pretending it’s a horse.",TheSpiritsGotMe,2025-05-08T17:00:55,-2
"I don't need protections against new housing, green energy and public transportation. Those are good things.  You don't understand the subject you arguing about.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-08T17:27:32,5
"You guys have such a religious devotion to bureaucracy that you've never even stopped to ask yourself why you're supporting regulations to prevent housing, public transportation and green energy installations from being built.  I think a better option for you here would be to admit you know very little about the permitting process, NIMBYism, etc and leave the discussion to people who are actually interested in policy and don't just view politics as entertainment.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-08T17:20:15,5
"I do, its just I think regulations and worker protections are largerly good things. I think the issue is regulatory capture by capital and that destroying the administrative state hand-in-hand with Republicans isn't the way to solve any of this. Nor is encouraging supply side economics. Since the U.S. has switched from New Deal economics to supply-side economics the rich have gotten much much richer while we have all gotten poorer.  'Abundance' is not the solution",NYSRSI,2025-05-08T17:55:15,-2
"You give a similar response to nearly every anti-neoliberal comment you respond to. You are unable to look at nuance. Which is why your initial response to me was “I guess neoliberalism means wanting affordable housing.”and now “religious devotion to bureaucracy”  I’m sorry your new pet ideology, which you say is not neoliberal, is being worn by neoliberals and republicans. If that bothers you, maybe you should leave the discussion to people who are actually interested in policy and don’t just view politics as entertainment.",TheSpiritsGotMe,2025-05-08T18:02:19,-1
"Unless you're going to explain why you think we need to be protected from housing, green energy and public transportation you really don't understand what this is about.  And that's ok to say. You very obviously have not looked into this movement at all.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-08T18:13:16,5
"The irony of saying I can't look at nuance while you completely avoid the argument in favor of using buzzwords like neoliberal.  I side with people who want to build housing, green energy installation and public transportation. You side with the people who have been blocking these projects.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-08T18:15:45,2
"I have, and I disagree with it. Supply side economics coupled with deregulation does not work for the working class, that has been pretty thoroughly proven over the last 50 years.  You don't have to be super defensive about it, like if the chips are down I will take an abundance liberal over a Republican any day.  But this economic plan is flawed and it won't work, the reason we don't have affordable housing isn't just a supply problem, there are more unoccupied houses then homeless people in the United States.  And while that is reductive it does shed light onto part of the problem, the problem isn't the amount of housing the problem is market forces.  And I do think some of the policies that are advocated for in Abundance are good and would be an improvement, especially in regards to zoning. I disagree with the very fundamentals, neoliberal supply side economics will transfer more wealth from the working class to the wealthy.  The policies in abundance will hurt union workers and benefit land owners and the owners of development companies.  The solution isn't cutting regulations and transferring more wealth to the ownership class.  The government doesn't need to work through middlemen, housing should be a right and it affordable housing should be directly created by the public sector not through concessions to the private sector.  I'm going to stop responding because you haven't been considering the responses or why people may push back against this rebranded neoliberal policy you have just gotten super defensive and condescending and like who needs that?",NYSRSI,2025-05-08T19:02:39,2
"I didn’t avoid the argument, I referenced the article. You are the one who did not supply an argument. Again, your response was a condescending one liner of “I guess neoliberalism is when you want affordable housing.”   What you cannot get around is that it is neoliberals who are rallying around this. As evidence, you being a neoliberal jumping in to both put distance between the “buzzword” and Abundance as well as defend it.   Are there some regulations in zoning that prevent affordable housing, yes. Will that alone bring down housing costs, no. Do we need to further deregulate the energy sector broadly, no. Do I trust the politicians who are prematurely touting Abundance and bipartisanship…hell no.  Edit: If anyone wants to see where neoliberals fall on Abundance, just go to their subreddits. I don’t know why they want to hide from it, but it’s pretty clear who is wearing the abundance mantle in our party.",TheSpiritsGotMe,2025-05-08T18:38:57,1
"Buddy you're literally arguing that making it illegal to build something is not the reason we don't have those things.  I need you to stop copy pasting Neoliberal, supply side, etc and realize you're arguing against a policy you don't even understand. You're projecting things onto the abundance movement that have absolutely nothing to do with it. You can't disagree with it since it's evidence based policy, not some ideological crusade.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-10T15:58:08,1
"> What you cannot get around is that it is neoliberals who are rallying around this. As evidence, you being a neoliberal jumping in to both put distance between the “buzzword” and Abundance as well as defend it.   Yeah dude I get you've been so negatively polarized against Liberals that you're now supporting efforts to block green energy and affordable housing because they support those things.  I'm just saying it's stupid.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-10T15:54:01,1
