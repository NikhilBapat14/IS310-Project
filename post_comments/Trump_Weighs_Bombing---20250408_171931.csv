"I swear, for a guy who campaigned on ""no wars"" he sure wakes up in a warmongering mood on a fairly regular basis.  Apparently, they're framing it as an attack on ""cartels""   Mexico reply: ""The people of Mexico, under no circumstances will accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat we want to make clear with this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty, this can‚Äôt be an opportunity by the United States to invade our sovereignty‚Ä¶. They can call [cartels] whatever they decide, but with Mexico it is collaboration and coordination, never subordination, no interference and even less invasion.‚Äù  *edited for spelling",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-08T17:28:56,158

"I'm not saying he wouldn't do it. But, the fact he likes to mention it without doing it, is more about distracting people from all the horrible things he is already doing.  His main tool is creating fears that he then says he will protect you from. Fear of losing jobs from immigrants, fear of criminals coming in from countries with people of color, fear of drugs killing our citizens, fear of other countries taking advantage of us. Standard practice for dictators and dictator wannabes. Like putin telling Russians that 'Nazis' from Ukraine would take their country away.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-08T18:05:34,31

" This is what I expected. Just as Russia lined up troops for an ‚Äòexercise‚Äô and invaded Ukraine, I assumed for months he would do this. As soon as he classified all those other groups as cartel terrorists, I saw the writing on the wall of him eventually invading and declaring war on the ‚Äòfentanyl‚Äô and then will start using wartime powers to further lock down his dictatorship and lock UP those who oppose him.",Karate_Cat,2025-04-09T00:14:34,3

This is a little bit off base. He is planning to strike cartels with Mexico‚Äòs aid and Assistance. The Mexican government may end up being 100% wrong about this. I‚Äôm just guessing but they think it‚Äôs a friendly move that will keep tariffs down. How long before Trump wants to bomb Canada?,Stormy31568,2025-04-08T22:49:44,1

He'll bomb anything just to day he did it because as President he CAN (IS MY RIGHT!) . It's like he's acting based on a BINGO card with all the horrible things a President can do and he's just waiting to hear the number that gives him the next move.,Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-09T06:38:18,1
