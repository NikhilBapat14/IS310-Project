"A two second google search reveals the truth, the patriot act has legal requirements/criminality for international money laundrying and terrorist financing in it. Repealing the act repeals the crimes/law enforcement authority to investigate, i.e. you can't sue or issue a writ of mandamus to require the fbi or the treasury to investigate Trump or any Billionares.  The spying part is just an added bonus but I am sure they'd keep the agency structure and the NSA through a budget process but just want the act gone to rid themselves of criminality to enrich themselves.",Ringandpinion,2025-05-08T11:21:05,87

"The Act allows for broader government surveillance of individuals, including phone tapping, wiretapping, and access to personal records without the need for probable cause.  Information Sharing: It streamlines information sharing between different government agencies to connect the dots in terrorism investigations.  Increased Penalties for Terrorism: The Act increases penalties for acts of terrorism and expands the definition of what constitutes a terrorist act.  Domestic Terrorism: The Act also addresses domestic terrorism, potentially subjecting political organizations to surveillance and criminal investigation for political advocacy.  Controversies and Concerns: Privacy Concerns: The Act has been criticized for infringing on individual privacy and civil liberties, particularly regarding the collection and use of personal data.  First Amendment Concerns: Some argue that the Act violates the First Amendment by allowing the FBI to investigate citizens for exercising their right to free speech.  Overreach of Government Power: Concerns have been raised about the Act's potential for overreach, with some arguing that it grants law enforcement too much power without sufficient oversight.  In summary, the Patriot Act aims to strengthen national security by enhancing law enforcement's ability to investigate and disrupt terrorism, but it has also been criticized for its potential impact on individual privacy and civil liberties..",soniahs77,2025-05-09T08:14:30,3

"Alright, I've got some questions about this. I'm an attorney who specializes in legislation, albeit not regarding federal surveillance/natsec law. Recently, I was actually looking into stuff regarding the Patriot Act, and ended up somewhat confused.  A lot of the sources that I found online referred to the Patriot Act as having expired, due to sunset provisions in the bill which weren't renewed (for some provisions in 2005, for others in 2011, and for the last 3 in 2019 and 2020). However, since the law so expensive and covers so many federal provisions, it's not all contained in one area of the United States Code, it's dispersed and not easy to tell where all the provisions are or what their effective dates/sunset dates are.  And aside from vague references from different websites reporting on the act expiring after the sunsets provisions were not renewed, I can't actually find explicit references to which sections have *actually* expired. And other sources seem to indicate that only Title 2 (the surveillance stuff) has expired, with the rest just not mentioned.  So for anyone with more expertise here, how much is still in effect? And how much has genuinely expired over the years? And can you point me towards any more concrete sources? This was personal curiousity on my own time, so I haven't searched for any treatises or law review articles about this on a database like Lexis, but I expected to find more than I did through Google.",lespaulbro,2025-05-08T13:35:12,2

This is the legislation that allows indefinite retention of terrorists in Gitmo right? Trump is looking for more prisons like Alcatraz and has eluded to putting immigrants in Gitmo.

There are very specific clauses that these people need to be non-US citizens. My suspicion is Trump wants it to be less restrictive because it grants a lot of unchecked power already. We can basically point at a non citizen and say they are a terrorist and lock them up with no due process of law.

"Eh, once they make it past Vance people are going to start stepping down to avoid the frankly awful job of trying to recover from what Trump's started.  I give it a 90+% chance that if Congress impeached and removed Trump and Vance we'd end up with a transitional governing structure while new elections were held.  This would be agreed upon by Congress before the first impeachment hearing, because the GOP leadership would want to distance themselves from Trump and be seen as helping restore the government instead of actively helping him destroy it.  This will, of course, never happen.  It can't.  It relies on a situation where Trump screws over his base badly enough that it finally breaks through their delusions and sours them on him.

"It sounds like there isn't even a time window for the ""structuring""; so if I sold a deaceased parent's car for $40k in cash, and I decided to buy a new car for ($30K new ) and then sell my car for ( $8k ). What keep that from being treating as structuring.    I would have a $9kish deposit left from the first sell, and $8k from the second, perhaps within days of each other.",techforallseasons,2025-05-08T15:37:32,1
