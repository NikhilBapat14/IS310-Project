"See, you're assuming Republicans actually want to fix things.   They don't. Maybe 15 years ago they did, but not any more. Immigration is one of those issues they can use to polarize voters, and as long as that's an issue, they don't actually have to come up with good policy decisions, they just have to lean hard into the anti immigration rhetoric.   Last congressional session, when Biden was still president, they literally didn't vote for a huge immigration reform bill that had bipartisan support because immigration was too useful an issue for the election",Picards-Flute,2025-04-28T07:34:02,15

"The politicians don’t really care about immigration any more than they care about which middle schoolers are allowed to play on which sports teams; it is a wedge issue that is used to give them the political capital to do the things they actually care about.  What they actually care about is to no longer feel constrained by our constitution nor laws. They want absolute power wielded by a presidential monarch who is answerable neither to our laws nor institutions.  With this in mind, their decision to block legislation that would address immigration in favor of unconstitutional and blatantly illegal executive action makes perfect sense. Going through Congress only reinforces the idea of congressional authority to direct the executive, whereas establishing a track record of getting away with breaking the law and ignoring the courts in service of wedge issues that have enough popular support to enable them to do it — well, this saps authority from Congress and courts, giving the law and the people it protects fewer bulwarks when the executive starts doing things that aren’t tied to wedge issues and don’t have any popular support.  It is a strategic decision to serve their ultimate goals.",Unlikely-Ad-431,2025-04-27T18:50:47,19

"This is not the first time Republican/Democrats have controlled all three branches and nothing has really been done.  Why?  The 1% needs cheep labor, farms need cheep labor and there are jobs that face it Americans do not want to do because the pay is way to low.  Big business knows it needs this workforce.  Florida is a good example of why we do not want bad policies like Trump is imposing.  Farm workers are not showing up to work for fear of being deported.  Why?  Well will you work a field for $11 and work 12 hours 7 days a week for 2 to 3 months?  Are you willing to have 20+ people living in one house?  Trump is pure evil.  He sends Canadians, Europeans and anyone it seems, back home (sometimes not their home countries) in leg and waist irons after holding them for up to 19 days without due process.  Republicans will never pass any law on immigration. To good to promote the hate so their voters will vote for them.  They lie about the crime rate immigrant's have.  They have a lower crime rate then we do.  That is a fact. Republicans promote fear and hate.  Typical of right wing propaganda throughout history.  In reality we are a country if immigrants.

"There are a few terrible reasons:  1) currently Trump is doing things by executive order which they will argue is proof of Republicans tackling immigration,  2) they will argue that legislation isn't needed because the authority to act is already there  3) when Democrats do take office they are going to argue it's needed as a condition of a spending bill and try to stone wall any budget with the issue of immigration. Its exactly what they did in 2019 when Democrats took office, Republicans all of a sudden remembered they wanted to build a wall and wouldn't pass a budget without funding for the wall in it.

"Republicans since Reagan at least have claimed that ""government is the problem"". They do not want the government to be successful, at least on the national level. They are still working towards state's rights.  They did work with the Democrats however and did come up with a lot of improvements to the immigration system, and then Trump scuttled it. He wanted the problem to be as bad as possible so he could call it a ""crisis"" and use that to justify seizing emergency powers. He even said as much out loud.  ""Trump urged Republicans to vote against the bill [before](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4433785-trump-says-blame-it-on-me-border-bill-fails/) it was unveiled last Sunday, arguing its passage would be a political victory for [President Biden ](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/)in the election-year matchup that is likely to feature both men as their respective party nominees. ""  [Trump praises collapse of bipartisan border deal: ‘I think it’s dead’](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4459861-trump-praises-collapse-of-bipartisan-border-deal/)  Trump and the Republicans don't want to fix the problem if it doesn't help them politically, showing where their true loyalty lies.  This is similar to their approach to the national debt. Their plan is:  1) cut taxes for the rich  2) run up huge deficits increasing the national debt  3) complain about the debt, call it a ""crisis""  4) reduce benefits for the poor and middle class since we are so ""poor""  5) repeat  They want a huge national debt to justify their reduction in benefits for the poor and middle class.

"On the topic of illegal immigration there are two groups inside the Republican party:  1) the working class people who make up the voting base of the Republican party who hate illegal immigrants because immigrants take jobs and lower wages (also racism)  2) the wealthy business owners who make up the donor base of the Republican party who love illegal immigrants because they work hard, cost very little to employ, and have no recourse against employer abuses (and if they try anything you can have them deported)  Notice how these two groups are in complete opposition to one another but this is America so when the working class and the rich are in political conflict the rich win.  So you get political theater with some useless walls on the border and the occasional ICE raid in the news in order to placate the first group but nothing that might actually stop the flow of illegal immigrants/cheap labor into the country like heavy fines or arrests of the business owners that hire illegal immigrants.  Doing something about illegal immigration would actually be harmful to the Republican party: its voters will have less incentive to vote and its donors will have less money to donate.  The use of ICE to violate civil/human rights is a recent thing; the money and politics is the reason Republicans haven't done anything for decades despite plenty of opportunities.",PedanticPaladin,2025-04-27T19:46:54,3
"Most of the necessary laws are already on the books, they were just being ignored.  You can see it with the all the current click bait headlines.

Guess what, people who violate parole get sent back to prison and people who are caught speeding have to pay fines.  Another surprise, you will have trouble entering other countries if you have any criminal history, and that includes DUIs. That country doesn't need proof of your crime, just being told about it by the home country is sufficient. All these demands that the US doesn't have proof of crimes is playing on the general public ignorance on how this works. Of course the US doesn't have the proof of crimes committed in other countries, how would they since it happened in another country?

This free labor from a quasi slave class that has absolutely no rights benefits corporations in the Uber rich in the United States a lot. This is the actual unspoken underlying reason why illegal immigration was left to run amok for 30 years.,XxSpaceGnomexx,2025-04-28T05:31:10,1

There are subs that seem to have no real moderation. And there are subs like this one, where the mods seem to try to stay hands-off, until blatant rule violations start to derail discussions. Personally, I really like my state sub. The moderation there is slow to give any kind of ban, quick to just delete offensive replies, and content to just lock up conversations that get too acrimonious (but it's also a sub with moderate numbers of users, and a large mod team, so that's easier to balance).

Using his personal security to try and overthrow the government of Venezuela.  Trumps trade policies and tariffs during his first administration are generally accepted as having a negative impact on the U.S. and pushing many Latin American countries into the direction of finding new trade partners.   Its the economic instability that the U.S. intentionally creates in South and Central America that causes the rise in immigration.  All the U.S. needs to do is change its domestic and foriegn policy that directly affects their economies and you reduce immigration.  Republican politicians really do not give one fuck about illegal immigration, it gets used as a wedge issue to force through a whole host of other horrible shit.  Democratic politicians are not smart enough to avoid the trap, because they are the same morons who use gun control as a wedge issue and use exactly the same tactic.  The problem being Democrats lose political power by pushing gun control, and Republicans amass political power by pushing immigration issues.  If Republicans cared about illegal immigration Greg Abbott would have been arrested for sending busloads of all the Venezuelan of immigrants, Trump generated, to Chicago, L.A., Denver...  What is the first thing Trump is doing in office?  Push tariffs, fucking up his own trade deals, creating global economic instability.  The only reason you wouldnt see increased immigration into the U.S. would be because Republicans caused the U.S. economy to collapse as it becomes a failed state.",neverendingchalupas,2025-04-28T12:06:15,2

"Immigration isn't ""such a problem"" in an explicit sense.  Our immigration rate, our refugee rate, is downright reasonable.  Immigration (even illegal) lowers our crime rate and improves our economy.    The economic right in particular wants this exact status quo, though.  Too many immigrants are undocumented, which means they have cheap unregulated labor.  Some (the capitalists are on both sides, so many on both parties feel the above way) Democrats want to create more legalization paths especially with the grey-area folks, so they can regulate them which makes regulations enforceable wrt the businesses that employ them.   Republicans REALLY don't want that.  And honestly, there's some proof that's the real answer.  There is one guaranteed way to get rid of illegal immigration *almost* entirely.  Redirect ICE to instead primarily go after the businesses that employ undocumented immigrants.  Pass new laws that punish businesses for employing undocumented immigrants ($3000 per immigrant fine max penalty I think?  Really?  That's just the cost of doing business.

"It already worked. It’s actually been working since the bush era. Frankly it seems that the GOP’s response to the brokenness of the immigration system has been to turn it into a justification for their ever increasing populist language and authoritarian policies. If they legislate on the problem rather than relying on unitary executive theory, they risk removing their single most popular issue to campaign on, their largest cudgel against dems, and they risk public opinion focusing on their responsibility rather than “the government’s”. We see this in their language. When they go on fox they still blame “the government” for all society’s woes even when they are in total control of the government.   They have been reduced to the basic problem of representative government but with a darker twist. Basically representatives want to help their constituents, but in order to be effective they have to stay in office, and in order to stay in office they need money to campaign. This theory is what is largely responsible for the overwhelming power of lobbyists and special interest groups. As well as the gerontocracy (hard to beat reps who have name recognition and a war chest who refuse to leave).   The GOP has taken this maxim, removed the “help my constituents” part and replaced it with “strengthen the party”. Which if your goal is to make your party stronger, you don’t need to pass legislation that helps people, you just need to keep turning out your supporters, the hard core that votes in primaries that are ultra loyal and don’t care about whether you actually fix things as long as you support the dear leader and hurt those that they don’t like.",Kirkevalkery393,2025-04-27T19:14:32,9

Funny how yall stop us from deportation every day. Again yall love cheap labor and low wages. Most of that is done by machines. People actually think they know about farms. Democrats pretend to care like biden stopping the railroad strike. Unions support them until there are no jobs left. We finally got someone not a career politician and not chosen by elites like over the last 3 of your candidates. Then yall want us to pay for more of your college then we already do. Over 55% of students at prestigious colleges get help from my tax and that doesn't count the other money colleges get and yall don't want them to pay tax on their billions.  So we pay for tariffs? But not tax? Charge the companies and guess what it will come from us plus yall don't want it temporarily. About 4 or 5 programs created by democrats consume all the money we have and even some we can't afford. Please more free programs. More projects is what we need.

"Also Biden deported more people in his term compared to Trump first term. Biden issued an executive order that sharply limited asylum, along with Mexico's help clamping down on the flow of migrants heading to the US within their borders, led to an overall decrease in illegal border crossings. Since then, the number of individuals released by the US Border Patrol pending immigration court proceedings decreased 70%. There was a large spike in migrant encounters at the border in Dec 2023 but that was temporary.. 2 months later it dropped to 2020 numbers. i’m criticizing Biden for this,  i hate him especially for the asylum restrictions. The left has always criticized democrat leaders for restricting paths to citizenship, limiting refugees, record high deportations.. remember Obama?? Deporter in Chief? All the protests against his massive deportation numbers? Republicans can just invent an issue…  like how we should deport immigrants (illegal or legal) who commit crimes. They are betting on the fact that people like you have no idea that this has always been the case! Since forever.. the US has always deported immigrants if they commit a crime, illegal or legal. This has never been disputed. Nobody has ever suggested otherwise, ever. It’s been the law for like 150 years. If you are not a citizen and convicted of a crime, you’re deported or jailed depending on the crime and then deported etc. You think these are all lies? If you honestly cared about the issues you talk about, you wouldn’t be calling anyone who tells u this a liar. You see liberals have always been super critical of Biden and Obama’s immigration policies, and of the democratic party for being huge pussies when it comes to policy in general. And republicans.. they don’t do anything, at all. They exaggerate issues that don’t matter or invent problems and magically solve them while making actual problem much worse. Since they have to remain in power and vote against any meaningful policy and play to the crowds like pro- wrestling heels vs babyfaces but it’s political pro wrestling. You just eat that shit up. Bro if you rich, party leaders in power will keep you rich, and make u richer, at the expense of everyone else.

Even musk supported them, got more rich from what they did but when elites affected elons family he left yall.",Optimal_Let7233,2025-04-30T00:16:29,-1

"You're closely following Trump's EO's is irrelevant to the topic nor changes the fact that he did indeed reverse Biden's EO's that are related to the topic.  So if you're presuming to have critical thinking and applying it to this conversation I'd say that you failed.  So good job on your watchdog status but what a shame you failed to apply it accordingly.

"“Mainstream Republicans” lol  [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx):  > Since 2020, the percentage of Republicans who say immigration is a good thing has dropped 23 points to 39%, a new low for Republicans. This is even lower than the 47% measured for Republicans after 9/11, when Americans overall had the least-positive views of immigration.

"Your coworkers with H-1B visas applied for those prior to the inauguration. They relocated to the US before the current administration began randomly revoking visas to detain and deport people without having valid reasons.   However, it’s unlikely there will be a decrease in the number of people arriving with H-1B visas but it’s highly likely less people will apply for those visas in the first place.",jmd709,2025-04-30T12:09:48,0
