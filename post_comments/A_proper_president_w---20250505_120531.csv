I have a theory about why Commander kept biting certain secret service agents. Some of them were Trump loyalists. Dogs are a good judge of character.,Mother_Barnacle_7448,2025-05-05T12:48:56,103

Right?! No it wasnâ€™t really a great look for the president to have this big dog that was not really properly trained. German Shepards are very smart but they need a knowledgeable owner that knows how to handle them and give them the exercise and work they need.,Cluefuljewel,2025-05-05T20:47:23,0

"One of the worst humans I know is an animal whisperer. All animals gravitate to him, he has a very calm persona and is generally kind to domestic animals but he also routinely poaches, steals from humans, litters, yet dogs in particular are drawn to him.
