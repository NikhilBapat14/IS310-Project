"That's sort of an American paradox: we have a representative government, but that government doesn't necessarily enact or implement laws that reflect the views of the majority of US citizens. The Senate in particular is set up to not respond to the will of a majority of citizens. [https://fair.org/media-beat-column/all-eyes-are-on-the-senate-8212-but-what-is-it/](https://fair.org/media-beat-column/all-eyes-are-on-the-senate-8212-but-what-is-it/)  Sometimes activist courts drag government forward where the legislative branch fears to go in cases like Roe v Wade, Brown v BOE, Obergefell v Hodges. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judicial\_activism](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judicial_activism) Filling court vacancies is one way a president can get around a Congress that doesn't want to go along, or on the other hand, to fulfill an unpopular agenda.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-14T22:00:20,6
"Answer: US government is composed of three main branches. The Legislative branch, the House and Senate create laws, and the Executive branch, the President enacts those laws by signing (or not- by using the veto power the president holds). The Judicial branch enforces those laws. By using case law to interpret how and when those laws are to be enforced.  In 1990 Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities act into law. It said essentially that the government and other entities offering services to the public cannot discriminate against persons with disabilities. Sounds great, right? Except it was, like many laws, kinda vague on just what form that discrimination had to take to be in violation of the law. Mostly in how the law applied when an entity was remodeling, or renovating, or otherwise altering an existing structure or facility.   Enter [Kinney V Yerusalem:](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/812/547/1761223/) A group of persons with disabilities sued a State transportation department for violating the ADA. When the State repaved a road, they argued, it had the legal responsibility under the ADA to also install compliant curb ramps at every crosswalk on that road. Because crosswalks are a public facility, and by not making them compliant the State was in violation of the law.  The State argued that their concern was only the road, the crosswalks and curb ramps were not required to be upgraded at that time.  The Supreme Court ruled that, no, by paving the road they were altering the existing crosswalks and thus triggering the legal requirement to upgrade them.    So case law determines how and when laws are to be applied for those times the law isn't clear. That's the power SCOTUS has and is why case law is so important in the US legal system. There are many more fascinating cases where the courts ruled in ways that importantly affected just how and when laws are applied.",Dr_Adequate,2024-11-14T21:12:40,4
"The United States, like most former British colonies, has a ""common law"" judicial system, which means that the Constitution and the Laws passed by congress are interpreted by the courts based on the past rulings of courts called ""precedent."" The government is expected to apply that ruling going forward, and other courts are expected to interpret following that ruling until Congress changes the law or the Supreme Court changes its decision (which is supposed to happen very rarely but is increasingly common)  gave a good description of what that looks like in practice  Almost all European countries (except Britain and Ireland) have a judicial system based on a ""civil code"", where judges interpret the law based on written law codes and do not consider the rulings of past courts.  So, in the US (and any common law system), one Supreme Court ruling can dramatically change how a law is applied for decades to come, whereas, in a Civil Code system, one ruling only affects the narrow issue it is being applied to.

">That's sort of an American paradox: we have a representative government, but that government doesn't necessarily enact or implement laws that reflect the views of the majority of US citizens.  Arguably the paradox was the expansion of voting rights without addressing the initial system. The US was originally set up for minority rule. There was no expectation by the founders that pretty much every citizen would have the right to vote. They were also very careful and it seems fearful of the situation we have today which is that large numbers of people flood to the most productive and lucrative states. This would potentially strip all/most power from wealthy elites who may not live there. I'm not necessarily saying that CA should have enough senators and house reps to essentially run the country but our current congressional seat distribution and some other systems definitely don't represent the current population.",randonumero,2024-11-15T07:09:57,3
"But then if the majority of Congress have one opinion, even if it does not fit with the one of the majority because representation is stupid, they could pass a law to secure this opinion. So they could have passed a law that enforce the right of states to decide over abortion matters so the SC can't intervene (provided it does not breach the constitution)",Mofane,2024-11-15T01:51:55,2
"Substantially right, except the Executive Branch enforces the laws.

"I mean, I understand why their ruling can change future ruling, but the law passed by the house of representatives still have priority right? So for instance if before Roe v Wade they decided to pass a law legalizing abortion you won't need to wait that the SCOTUS decide from a specific case it is legal to have abortion?",Mofane,2024-11-15T01:44:31,1
"Sort of right. Congress could pass a law legalizing abortion nationwide. A person could attempt to obtain an abortion in a state with an abortion ban, taking advantage of the federal law. The some other party could attempt to obtain an injunction preventing that abortion. But what plaintiff could have standing? The fetus? Unclear whether that would fly. Someone offended by the idea of an abortion? That was what was thrown out in [*Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA*](https://www.aclu.org/cases/danco-laboratories-llc-v-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine-u-s-fda-v-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine) \- third parties don't have standing.

"Yes, Harris was running on passing such a law. The caveat is that the Supreme Court can declare a law unconstitutional. So, for instance, Obergerfall v. Hodge declared the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriages and all state-level bans, unconstitutional.  Another reason the SC is comparatively powerful is that it is incredibly difficult, and in the current political climate, it is virtually impossible to amend the Constitution.  Once the SC makes a ruling, the only people that can undo it is the SC",loselyconscious,2024-11-15T02:19:16,1
Yeah I got the idea about it is not new law it is new standard interpretation of law /constitution. But don't federal law have priority when conflicting with local laws?,Mofane,2024-11-16T02:58:06,1
"That was the great debate of the 1830s-1850s: [Nullification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)#The_nullification_crisis).  Nowdays, nullification is out, but it's still possible to challenge that federal law in the federal courts on constitutional grounds. If found unconstitutional, that federal law can't be enforced and state or local law stands. Unless it's successfully challenged in state court...  Further, to sue to challenge constitutionality, the plaintiff must have standing - face actual harm from the action of the law. In the case of abortion, it's possible to argue that the only party who could possibly have standing is the fetus. That leads to arguments over whether a fetus is a person, another requirement to have standing. The amicus briefs would be flying!",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-16T12:49:01,2
"Okay I think I got it. Like the court has the power to ""remove"" a law like abortion ban if they find somehow it is in contradiction with the constitution. And the constitution is super generic so they most of the time find a way to do so. Kinda weird but ok.   But in that case can we really imagine that a court could have found a basis in the constitution to nullify one of those federal law allowing abortion/ gay marriage/ desegregation ? Maybe in the part of constitution about states rights?   Because for now if SCOTUS wants they can remove all those decisions tomorrow if they claim previous courts were mistaken?",Mofane,2024-11-17T04:56:47,1
