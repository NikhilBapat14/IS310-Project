"Ben Ali essentially ceded power to an interim government, which then held new elections. Mubarak, same thing, he resigned, ceding power to an interim government (which was the army). Essentially, there was either a popular or powerful sole guarantor of the constitutional order in each case.  Libya's transition was much more violent, and, because of the violence, there were many armed actors that could compete with the interim government and eventually did.  > However, was NATO aiming to cause such an extreme collapse of Libya?  No, it was intervention on the cheap. [Former President Obama called Libya his worst mistake](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/barack-obama-says-libya-was-worst-mistake-of-his-presidency) in that the Western bloc failed to adequately plan for what would come after the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-11-08T07:28:44,6
"NATO threw thousands of bombs on Libya and destroyed almost everything they had.  Libya once had a network of pipes that supplied fresh water up to 1600km into the desert, it's in my opinion one of the most beautiful projects ever to be done in Africa.. Until NATO destroyed it. Millions of people relied on that fresh drinking water.",Hapsbum,2022-11-11T19:37:29,3
"I get your point about how NATO destroyed essential stuff in Libya. But now that I think about it, the USA led a full-scale invasion of Iraq, yet present-day Iraq, despite all its problems, is still functioning much better than Libya (and keep in mind that Iraq has to contend with more severe ethnic and religious tensions than Libya does).",[deleted],2022-12-14T06:51:20,2
"True! But Iraq was invaded in 2001, completely destroyed and the US puppet government had no opposition.   In Lybia it's a much bigger mess.. Part of the EU was supporting the other side than the other part of the EU.",Hapsbum,2022-12-15T09:47:16,3
