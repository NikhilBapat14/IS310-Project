"Can't really blame them. Who wants the antichrist, sorry, tRump telling them their country is going to become the 51st state. That would be like hitler telling countries on his border at the beginning of WWII, that he was. Never mind. Most of you wouldn't understand. Especially those who do not believe in history repeating itself. I'm truly sorry for young Americans.",pogishushu,2025-04-22T19:49:21,40

"Buddy of mine went to Miami for work. Was harassed at pool bar from some guy with Trump stickers all over his laptop. Saying repeatedly 51st state,51st state. My friend had a few to many and kept saying f$&# that repeatedly.  Bartender told my buddy to calm down because there a lot of interesting characters in Miami and you never know what they might do.

"Most of Florida will be consumed by climate change driven rises in sea level and increasing storm intensity within the next 50 years I suspect. It’ll get turned into a national park you can go visit but not live in.

I'm honestly surprised more Canadians didn't start selling their properties after Ron DeSantis was reelected governor,MC_chrome,2025-04-23T01:51:08,11

As a leftist and a queer I don’t feel welcome in Florida either despite being an American - I have zero interest in ever vacationing in that state ,thirdeyepdx,2025-04-22T23:02:00,52
"I actually know a few snowbirds. According to them It gets super hot in the summer time there but they go down to avoid the winter weather. Also the best time to visit, as in general to travel there is always in June. It's not too hot in June, in my opinion, but also right before peak tourist season and even with the humid/hot weather you now have center air/AC units that can keep you cool. Also it's by the beach and has palm trees. I believe that Florida's political climate sucks right now but it does have several good things going for it. Like several big name amusement parks (Disney World, LEGO Land, Universal, etc...), Daytona, Cap Carnival, the Keys, etc ..  Edit  Also if you want to live year round you also have to put up with hurricanes and right now or seems that insurances are dropping high risks areas and Florida seems to one of them.",randomnighmare,2025-04-22T22:37:06,6

"I know someone “in the family” but not blood who is desperate to move to Florida for the weather. As someone who spent a couple of years in Florida, I can confirm it’s a fucking shithole and I don’t get it either.  We all use to laugh at how the plethora of DUIs were all from highly educated folks (doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc) because it was indicative that there isn’t shit to do in that hellhole but get drunk.",buggybugoot,2025-04-23T08:55:26,1

"I should be punched down a notch, is that what you are saying? I was speaking in generalities. Not for myself but those who should get off social media sites 24 hours a day. Look at history for just a few minutes searching. What would it hurt for five minutes of their time. The I can see and hear you, but will never experience actual introduction to each other. The face to face to see what they are together. Okay, so I lack your educational skills in history, grammar and probably spelling. The youth will inherit this democracy that is being daily dismantled by a want to be king. A dictator. I served my time in the early 70's. This country has lost men and women that dedicated lives, so we could be a country with individual freedoms, that all men are created equal (that's a joke) and the **First Amendment:** Guarantees freedom of religion, speech, the press, assembly, and the right to petition the government, which you are welcome to belittle me some more if you wish. I am not long for this earth so be my guest. This is the only site I watch mostly in the evenings except for today. This king cannot hurt me.

"My point was that there are a great many Canadians completely on board with 51st state talk and it’s disturbing and needs to be punched down and away. Germany’s neighbors knew what was going on, and the ones that didn’t like it got invaded. There are complicit Canadians, just as there were Austrians.  Also, if you are Canadian, you should know we do t have any Amendment Rights. That’s the American system.",eldonte,2025-04-24T08:07:35,1
