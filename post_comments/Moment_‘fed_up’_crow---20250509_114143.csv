"Crowds of everyday people standing up to authoritarian scumbags makes me incredibly proud to be a bay stater and an American.

"""we don't have to show you anything"". If they are unwilling to provide proof that they are, in fact, law enforcment and that they have a legitimate reason to be hauling someone away, then they should not be able to charge anyone with assault on an officer.

"This isn’t law enforcement, it’s terror. ICE tearing families apart in broad daylight without a warrant should have the whole country screaming. Where’s the outrage? How is this acceptable in any decent society?",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T11:51:25,203
"I've been thinking about this since the first woman was dragged out of a town hall while everyone sat quietly around her, some not even looking at the scene. In those cases, seated in auditorium style seating in tight rows, if the people in that row had crowded around her, there would've been no way for the fake deputies to get to them. Even if people just stood up and blocked their path.  So my idea (which is still evolving, please be kind) is to crowd around the person being taken. Swarm around them. Hug and hang on. Five people. Ten. Ten becomes twenty. Dead weight and hide your face. Become a protective ball of humans around the vulnerable. Yes it will escalate the anger of the agents. But that's the point. They should not be allowed to steal people without resistance. Every attempt should be fought against. I absolutely understand not everyone would be able to do this or even agree with this idea. Participation would be terrifying, violent and potentially expensive (legal fees if arrested.) But if anyone out there finds themselves in this situation- where a neighbor is being violently dragged from their homes like this, please as many as possible- grab them and hold on. It's not a perfect idea but I'd like to open the discussion on it or other resistance alternatives.",bebejeebies,2025-05-09T13:36:35,30

A civil war is all but certain at this point, because, to be honest, the shame I am talking about faded away a long time ago. Honor in politics and in the public sphere is all but gone, as well as truth. Everything in America is fads and appearances. The population is honestly just too uneducated and fat on their own glory to understand what is happening.    I'm not really sure what the average Redditor thinks a civil war is going to be like, but its going to suck a lot more than whatever that is. If it's as bad as I think it could be, 50 million people die. It will be indiscriminate and unbelievably vile.  It's also going to happen much quicker than anyone thinks. All it takes is a viral video of agents firing on the crowd and a battle breaking out and suddenly everyone is taking the law into their own hands.",armageddon_20xx,2025-05-09T21:30:11,2

Without it there are some structural problems with being human pieces of shit.   State Police answer to the governor and the court system within the state itself. Massachusetts is unlikely to elect anyone who will sanction that kind of behavior or even allow it. Massachusetts might be the most ironclad democratic stronghold.  I also know from my experience with cops, that the last thing local cops want is Staties breathing down their necks, or even worse, the National Guard.   I agree that there are things to be concerned about, but I don’t think local cops are going to be the real problem in any permutation of this situation unless the specific bad actors have been recruited by other organizations to act on their behalf.

"Yeah, but there's a difference between actual deportations with due process and those without. In one scenario the vast majority of people have confidence that the government did the right thing, in the other scenario that is not the case.   It's all about how much people trust the government. And people are rapidly losing trust in it.   But you believe what you want to believe. You won't know I'm right until the day it happens; that's totally fine.",armageddon_20xx,2025-05-09T23:21:07,2

Seems to me like you and I aren’t that far apart on this.   But it also seems to me like this post is a video of ICE co-opting these cops. In a deep blue state. In a city where the cops work for a mayor who posted a statement that WPD don’t help ICE and don’t stop ICE. This video looks to me like WPD is helping ICE.  Edit to add - also I’m enjoying this civil discussion about this. Thank you.,invisimeble,2025-05-09T19:57:55,2

"Ehhh, I hear this a lot from people online, it has not been my experience in person.   I've definitely known a lot of older people, my roommate's parents for example, who are Catholic and have more conservative social views, but personally do not know many who vote Republican because of that fact   Not saying it's not happening to some degree, but I much more frequently hear other reasons like the economy,  gender issues, and especially ""crime."" I have an *incredibly* hard time believing abortion is the main driver, based both on polling data and anecdotal experience  I honestly think this is a persistent myth based on stereotypes, or at the very least has been greatly exaggerated",bluehour1997,2025-05-09T17:37:33,11

"And that is the thing I’m specifically concerned about.   My dispute is with the idea that local police officers in MA are going to, without the presence of federal agents and a specific task, start engaging in brutal random violence just because they’re so bloodthirsty, and not get in trouble.   This entire conversation has been unfortunately and unintentionally colored by the comment I was originally responding to and the initial impression I had that you were coming to the defense of the offending party’s comments.   I’m fucking concerned, but the idea that there are thousands of rampantly trigger happy officers just itching to flatline someone with no regard for the consequences just in Massachusetts is a position I have problems with. ",Dangerousrhymes,2025-05-09T20:23:36,1
