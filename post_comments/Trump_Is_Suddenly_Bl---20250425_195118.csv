Too bad they were so stupid in voting for a guy who led an insurrection four years earlier.,schu4KSU,2025-04-25T20:02:39,3769
Got to remember that the majority of the country isn't hearing the same things that many of us are hearing and seeing. They're going about their lives and they might notice a little tick up in the supermarket or hear something about terrorists but many of them don't have a clue. And if they do they're willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. And if they watch Fox News well you can forget those folks. So it's up to the rest of us to keep protesting and spreading the word and showing up and eventually they won't be able to ignore us.,TopEagle4012,2025-04-25T20:14:51,902
