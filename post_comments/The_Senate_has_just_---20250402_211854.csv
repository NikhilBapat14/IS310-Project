"It's important to note that the House won't vote on the resolution and Trump won't sign this into law so it is essentially DOA.  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/senate-republicans-buck-trump-join-dems-in-rejecting-canada-tariffs-00267480  https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5228328-trump-canada-tariffs-resolution-gop-senators/  Even so, I'm impressed that Rand Paul co-sponsored this resolution in a rare show of bipartisanship and presented a very cogent explanation for bucking Trump:  trade is good for an economy, tariffs are a tax, and taxes are to be enacted by Congress--not the executive branch or by one person.

"Let's hypothetically suppose that some number of rank-and-file Republicans in the House of Representatives (who are NOT part of the House majority leadership) decide Trump's tariffs (and their likely effect on the US economy) are the last straw, and ""go rogue"".  Is there any procedural mechanism that would allow a sufficiently-large ephemeral bipartisan coalition of House Republicans and Democrats to force a bill to the floor (say, declaring an end to Trump's declared ""state of emergency""... or if necessary, eliminating his ability to *use* a state of emergency to impose tariffs) over the **vehement** opposition of Mike Johnson and the remainder of the House Majority leadership, in any kind of reasonable time-deterministic manner?  For this thought experiment, assume that those House Republicans feel confident that their constituents will forgive them for going against Trump to prevent ""The Greatest Depression""... but for whatever reason, they think literally *deposing* Mike Johnson and handing majority control of the House to Democrats would be a step too far.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-04-02T22:41:21,1

"More of a small thing, but ""yea"" does not mean ""yes."" In non-modern English, we had a four-form system for affirmatives and negatives. Where ""yes and no"" were traditionally used to address negatively formulated questions, ""yea and nay"" were used to address positively formulated questions.  Think of it this way, if I were to ask you -- ""Will you not go?!"" If you answer ""Yes"", in modern English, your meaning is ambiguous. Are you confirming you won't go, or are you saying you're willing to go? A two-form system is open to these ambiguities, and a four-form system closes them.  So, going back to the 4 form system (Yes, No, Yea, Nay):  ""Yes"" *contradicts* a negatively formulated question and ""No"" *affirms* it. So in the above example, a ""Yes"" would mean ""I will go.""  ""Yea"" *affirms* a positively formulated question while ""Nay"" contradicts it. To use the same example:  ""Will you go?!"" If you answer ""Yea"", then of course, you will.

"Indeed they are, but to varying degrees. A non-denominational church, while still culty, is nothing compared to LDS or JW.",MuppetShart,2025-04-03T11:34:05,2
"That was my first thought reading that comment too. The sole difference between a cult and Christianity is that Christianity is widely accepted. Which makes it no surprise that a lot of Trump supporters are Christians, it's the exact same sort of mentality that breeds a cult like Trump's.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-10T13:53:38,1

"Republicans gleefully handed Trump sweeping powers to handle the ""economic emergency"" he declared on day 1, and this was a measure to stop the clock so it couldn't be challenged as quickly.  There's frankly not enough lawyers in the country for all the stuff we should be challenging.",Cortower,2025-04-03T08:32:41,2

"I know and Canadians shouldn’t go back. The alcohol boycott is actually the provincial governments, which are responsible for purchasing all alcohol sold in their provinces (from consumers to hotels, bars and restaurants). They are no longer selling US alcohol, so no Canadians are able to buy it in Canada.",Housing4Humans,2025-04-03T06:56:27,7
The boycott is not a government mandated action. It is a grassroots movement born out of citizen's anger towards a country many considered a friend. Consistently being threatened with annexation does that to people. Dropping tariffs will not change anything.,lorainnesmith,2025-04-03T06:51:29,4

"Celebrating a tiny minority of GOP senators switching for a vote they know fully well is meaningless and has zero chance of actually changing anything shows much more naïveté than it does positivity.  Yes, celebrate the wins however small. But falling for obvious political bullshit doesn’t help anyone, and only serves to give the GOP a pass (“see, we are on your side!”)",gatoaffogato,2025-04-03T11:10:28,2
