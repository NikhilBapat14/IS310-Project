If he's truly concerned about people facilitating fascism he should be looking within his own party.,Merax75,2025-04-21T09:29:01,12

The CCP issued exactly the same warning to countries that take the side of the US in trade agreements.   The commonality here is not an accident.,jcr2022,2025-04-21T09:17:33,7
"Leftism by default is authoritarian. Its economic model requires indirect manipulation of society, through monetary, fiscal and regulatory means to force it in a direction the “experts” deem necessary. The traditional socialist and interventionist policies are known to be failures and create societal turmoil, they can’t advertise that so directly. They’ve since shifted to ruses such as hijacking the LGBT movement, climate change, “Democracy”, WW3, Racism, to drive their non-sequitur arguments that increase centralization of power and regard bigger government as the only answer to “repair” such externalities. In its implementation, it is almost exactly fascist. So if the left wants to find whom is accelerating fascism in this country so badly, they need only look in the mirror. Unfortunately, many of them are aware of this.",Realityiswack,2025-04-21T08:40:59,9

It seems that the democrat politicians still think the American people will believe everything they are being told.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-21T08:59:45,19
The anarchists are proclaiming that our democracy is in danger? How rich that is. They're the ones creating the breakdown of society.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-21T08:14:33,9
Yes that is why so many leftists also end up being complete hypocrites. The ones that actually want freedom stupidly want the systems to be facilitated to having the power to easily take away freedom.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T08:50:44,1
Given the opportunity the Democrat party will try to roll back the current open access to news/knowledge so that as Mika B. said on Morning Joe they can again tell the normals/serfs what they should think.,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-21T09:58:39,8
