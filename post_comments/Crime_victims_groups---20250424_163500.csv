What about families he uses as political props? There are no funds for them?,fairoaks2,2025-04-24T16:39:48,7
"This is big. I worry it's just going to be yet another story lost in the flood of bad trump administration news, but it should be a big deal. I hope this becomes a major story. **Democrats, here's your chance!! Make a huge deal out of this!!**  The trump admin goes on and on and on about how Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than crime victims. And now they're defunding services that help crime victims! The hypocrisy is incredible!  >Among the organizations who have been stripped of their federal funding is a major Maryland criminal victims organization, which provides healing services for major city violent crime victims.   *Maryland!!* The same state Rachel Morin and Kilmar Abrego Garcia lived in. The same state as Chris Van Hollen. Republicans tore into him because they accused him of not caring enough about the Morin family. Okay, are Republicans going to defend this Maryland organization?",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T16:58:13,6

"To all the brainwashed MAGAts out there: If this doesn't prove the hypocrisy of him pulling stunts like running Rachel Morin's mom out there as a prop to further demonize immigrants, nothing will. ",HansSolo69er,2025-04-26T20:18:17,1
