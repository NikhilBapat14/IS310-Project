"In a lot of countries the ""liberal/conservative"" dynamic doesn't refer to the specific political ideologies but more in the broader meaning of ""open to change/sticking to old ways.""  A classic example is in China where ""conservative"" generally refers to traditional Communists/Maoists because that was the ""old way.""    In other cases, the ""liberal/conservative"" is mostly used or to help describe to outsiders different groups, even though those labels aren't really accurate, because those terms are more well-known and can get the basic meaning across without requiring giving the audience brand new terms to know.  For example, the ""liberal/conservative"" paradigm isn't the driving paradigm in Japanese politics but for me to use the accurate terms, would require me to spend time on what those words mean and a brief primer on Japanese political history and its own little quirks, so its probably better off to just use ""liberal/conservative"" or similar paradigms because that will give the audience the needed information they need without going into a long history of the 1955 system and post-95 Japanese politics.",Naliamegod,2024-07-08T10:21:25,7
"Because there is no meaningful dichotomy besides reform and traditionalism. Anything else might be a helpful lens for understanding political dynamics, but no society is immune from left/right political forces.",[deleted],2024-07-08T10:41:16,2
>Why do many nations outside the US also give primacy to the liberal/conservative dynamic?  Do they? Which nations were you thinking of? My impression is that it is mostly Anglo-Saxon media describing foreign politics in these terms to make them more legible for their own readers back home.,PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-07-08T11:07:42,1
"I'm not exactly certain they do. There's probably some degree of legacy with the standards set by the world rapidly getting rid of their monarchies virtually simultaneously, but what constitutes ""rightwing"" and ""leftwing"" is a lot more enigmatic than people realize.  Like, the traditional definitions of conservative vs. liberal primarily pertain to *only* the economy, and entirely leave out the sociological and political affects various different country's version of ""conservative/liberal"" take.   Like, the US Republican party is actually pretty big on big government--- in all aspects but economic. In that they are very happy to deregulate large corporations--- but heavily regulate their citizens at the request of those corporations.   Where as in my country, the Conservative party tends to be more traditionally conservative--- as in, they will sit on their hands and let everyone figure it out for themselves until they don't have a choice but to do something.",ThisDudeisNotWell,2024-07-13T14:08:22,1
"Just for context, it's used in the same way in the United States.  The only difference is that depending on where you are, changing might mean opposites.  In the USSR, liberals wanted free market capitalism.  Heck, you can even go into many ex-soviet countries today, 35 years after the collapse of the USSR and they'll talk about how they have found some original Reeboks: just some old, Reebok shoes.  But these shoes had such a reputation among young people of being representative of freedom, that still today using them is used as social proof that you have a certain ideology.  Not so in the United States.",solid_reign,2024-07-08T14:41:44,1
