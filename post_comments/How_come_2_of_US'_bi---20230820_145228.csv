"The Democratic and Republican political parties are some of the oldest on earth still in operation. (Last time I looked into this, it actually appeared that the Democrats are the oldest political party on earth, beating out the UK's conservative party by just a smidge.)   As a result of this, their names don't really follow modern political party naming trends of including your ideology in the name. They pre-date the tradition.  The Democratic Party is, simply, named in honor of democracy. The party had a few different names thrown around when it was being founded, but the Democratic Party pretty quickly won out and was finalized as the name.  The Republicans are named after the Democratic-Republican Party. This was the dominant political party in the US from roughly ish 1800 to the 1820s. They competed against the Federalist Party... until they completely and utterly destroyed the Federalist around the back half of the 1810s. The Democratic-Republicans are named that by historians to differentiate them from our modern parties, but when that party actually existed they referred to themselves as the Republicans.  So when our current day Republicans were getting started, they took the name of the old party that used to dominate the country.",omgwouldyou,2023-08-20T23:56:07,25

"We are all part of USA which is in fact a Federal Constitutional  Democratic Republic . Federal = a centralized seat of govt (Washington DC) Constitutional= Nationalized rules & Laws.   Democratic = we vote to elect our representatives (Congress & Senate)  Republic =  Ownership of our nation of the people, by the people & for the people.   The political party names were happenstance.",GrayMatters50,2023-08-21T11:31:17,3
"They're just names that the founders went with, and over history names and general ideologies changed. One of the main parties in the country was the Wig party, another that was here and there was the ""democratic-republic"" party.   You could call them them Michael and Daniel parties and it wouldn't change their ideologies. A lot of countries have major parties with the word ""democrat"" or ""Democratic"" in their name but they align with a more center-right ideology that the US democratic parties more moderate-left leanings.",TheFalconKid,2023-08-21T13:55:25,2

There are some inaccuracies in your response,theconcreteclub,2023-08-21T09:28:28,1
"This isn't true at all.  The Republicans are the former Federalist party known as the Whigs, that's why the Federalist society aligns itself with conservatives to this day.  The Democrats came from the Democratic-Republican party which was founded by Thomas Jefferson, a staunch anti-federalist. While some anti-federalists were slave owners, they believed in a Bill of Rights for the common person while Federalists opposed a bill of rights. That's why these unofficial parties were referred to as pro-administration and anti-administration during those years after ratification.  There is nothing connecting Jefferson's party to the modern Republican party and why the federalist society calls the Republican party their home: Because the Republican party has its roots in federalism.  The Democratic-Republicans were basically the Dixiecrats in addition to states-rights anti-federalists Bill of Rights supporters, while the Republicans have always been about centralized power, centralized banking, national government, etc.  The old Whig/Republican party is modern date Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, John McCain types while the new Republican party is basically the slave-owning confederacy. The common connection they have is there subservience to centralized power and money.  Slavery in this context had little to do with political parties and more to do with the anti-slavery liberals of the time were opposed to it, and the liberals are basically gone from the modern Republican party while there were a lot of northern liberals in the old Republican party such as Lincoln.",AstroBoy2043,2023-08-29T20:23:38,0

"Unfortunately there are numerous inaccuracies in u/omgwouldyou's response.  The Republican party derived its name from meetings held by former Whigs, Free Soilers and anti Slavery Democrats across the north after the collapse of the Whig party in 1852. Horace Greely is really the one who named them in June 1854- ""We should not care much whether those thus united (against slavery) were designated 'Whig,' 'Free Democrat' or something else; though we think some simple name like 'Republican' would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery.""  As I said the Republican Party is a conglomeration of former Whigs, Free Soilers and anti Slavery Democrats. They had their first convention in 1856 and by 1858 held a majority in the House.  The Democrats are an amalgamation of former Federalists and factions of the Democratic-Republican party which collesqued after the collapse of the Democratic Republicans after 1824. Martin Van Buren had taken these factions and organized them around Andrew Jackson. The 1828 Presidential Election saw the John Q Adams' National Republicans against Jackson's Democrats. The party wasnt officially named the Democrats until their 1844 election. But the Democratic-Republican name derives from Federalists mocking them in reference to the democratic radicals of the French Revolution.",theconcreteclub,2023-08-21T09:42:25,5
"Be warned, if you read the following comment thread, you will witness one of r/Ask_Politics‚Äô greatest battles.

"Please stop for a second and go back and actually read my post.   I said literally nothing at all about where the modern Republican Party came from. Not a single word.  All I said is that the name ""Republican"" was selected as an homage to the Jefferson Republicans. Which is true. The dude who popularized the name admired some of the qualities he associated with the Jefferson Republicans and wanted the gop to uphold those qualities as well.  Also. The Federalist and the whigs are different groups, neither of which has anything to do with the modern Federalist society. But I don't see much of a need to point out the historical flaws in your own timeline since, once again, I was not commenting on the timeline of how the party's developed.",omgwouldyou,2023-08-29T20:37:15,1
I mean look at a historical electoral map. They literally swapped ideologies.   Do people seriously not know this?,[deleted],2023-09-20T17:00:23,5
"Nothing you posted is in opposition to what I said, it's just more detail. I'm rather confused by the hostile tone of your comment.   The democrats are named as such in honor of democracy. I never commented on how or why the party developed, just it's name since that's the topic of this post. I suppose you can quibble on me saying the party ""quickly"" settled on ""Democrats"". If you really wanted to nit pick the definition of the word quickly.  The quote you used for your Republican ""rebuttal"" is straight from Wikipedia. So I know you also had access to the source listed on Wikipedia that supports what I said about the Republican name. It's a reference to the Jeffersonian Republican Party.   Thank you for providing more detail on the topic. But might I suggest coming at this in the future with a less randomly hostile approach. You are, indeed, allowed to just simply expand on a topic.",omgwouldyou,2023-08-21T09:50:19,10

"This is correct.   The modern Republican party has no connection to Jefferson's anti-federalist party which later became the Democrats.  The Federalist party morphed into the Whigs, then the Republicans.  We know this because the federalist society has always called the Republican party its home and everything we know about the modern GOP can be traced back to the federalists.",AstroBoy2043,2023-08-29T20:41:23,1
"Okay but you are saying the Federalists and Republicans are two different entities and that has never been true.  Your also leaving some false impression that Jefferson's anti-federalists had some connection with todays Republican party when so such connection exists.  People reference Jefferson more than Washington these days in talking about the founding fathers precisely because he was a staunch anti-federalist because people admire the bill of rights way more than the did the old federalist party, aka the Whigs, aka the Republicans today.",AstroBoy2043,2023-08-29T20:44:03,1

"All I said was that there were some inaccuracies. There was no hostility at all. You're angry about being told you had some inaccuracies in your response. Its the internet, relax.  In addition you were wrong about the origins of the Republican Party as they are former Whigs, Free Soilers, and anti Slavery Dems. To say they are "" Democratic-Republican Party"" is 100% wrong.

"Is this a joke? Did they not teach about how FDR fundamentally changed ideologies of the Democratic Party by embracing populist welfare policies during the depression? That this is the genesis of the small-government Republicans, who used to be *BIG* government because‚Ä¶.they literally reformed the government after the civil war‚Ä¶.  And then the 1960s the civil rights movement saw a greater realignment. Northern Dems supported it while southern Dems pivoted to the Republican Party, which in shambles following FDR. The northern elites embraced the Dems, and southern whites embraced the Republicans   By the 1980s the conservative movement carved out its hold in the rural south, while the democrats consolidated support in minority-dense urban areas.",[deleted],2023-09-20T18:48:04,4

You taking that quote from Wikipedia matters because the citation on the quote explains that the broader statement is referencing the Jefferson Republican Party.
