"US manufacturers have already started sourcing fiber from Europe instead of Canada.  We will also likely see more Eucalyptus showing up in our TP.   Paper doesn't come from native forests.  It comes from farms that are purpose grown and take about 10 years to reach maturity.  (You cannot efficiently harvest a native forest.)  That means that no matter what we do, even if we decided to plant trees tomorrow, the industry can't move for 10 years.    Also, our pulp mills are a hundred years old and you can smell them from 20 miles away.  Compare that to Brazil who have brand new, state of the art mills that are 10x bigger, and you can't smell them even when you are standing in the parking lot.  The excess cost to move the pulping industry would cost more than the tariffs.  So like almost every thing else in this wonderful tariff plan, it just amounts to tax on us. It cannot force manufacturing to come back here, because it makes no sense to do so. Furthermore, the fact that the tariff deals keep changing means no investor in their right mind would commit to spending large capital on moving an industry.  For all we know, Canada will agree to build a Trump tower in Ontario, and the tariff will go away again tomorrow.",MourningRIF,2025-05-10T10:50:18,1
