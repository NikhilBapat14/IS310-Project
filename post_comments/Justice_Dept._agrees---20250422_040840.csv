"It's honestly alarming how casually we're accepting the idea that this administration will use such sensitive data responsibly, considering the ECAS system holds records on millions of immigrants, really, dating back to the 1990s, and includes everything from names to family member details and even law enforcement interactions, so it's just... incredible.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-22T04:16:49,24
"I just assume that anything DOGE receives access to is immediately compromised by or sent directly to Russian intelligence. I'm just waiting for the day when it is exposed as such, years from now, when we can do nothing about it.",KeviRun,2025-04-22T04:35:59,8

"This has nothing to do with ""Gov't Efficiency"".  These are purely and simply a cabal of vicious criminals, doing what they have no business doing...  MAJOR Conflicts of Interest - obvious to ""the rest of us"":  1. While TSLA is tanking, and with no stated purpose, Musk is busy fishing through  US immigration records .. these records SHOW Musk worked here illegally on a J-1 Visa.... (under Zero Tolerance, he WOULD AND SHOULD BE DEPORTED by now) 2. Members of DOGE are highly susceptible to coercion and bribery, such as the Jr. Bigot that Musk re-hired after - even the child himself - knew he was unfit, and resigned:  >""The team also includes[ Marko Elez](https://archive.is/o/pum5L/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/11/doge-treasury-access-marko-elez/), who resigned from the government in February after the Wall Street Journal linked him to a social media account that had made racist posts. He was [rehired after Musk dismissed](https://archive.is/o/pum5L/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/elon-musk-marko-elez-vance-trump/) the significance of the posts.""",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-22T04:34:03,8

"Well said.  ""case histories of millions of legal and undocumented immigrants""  These intrusions are just unlawful ""fishing expeditions"", for which Trump's DOJ will - once again - be brought to task.  Musk's case will obviously be in this database, and what will stop DOGE from amending records of his obviously unlawful work on a J-1 visa?",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-22T04:29:11,5

"full godwin but back in the day the very detailed residency records in my country were used to find everyone they wanted to find since all records were all nicely filed and kept up to date. Suspicion of public indecency? Must be gay, off to the camps. Religion other than christian? Off to the camps. You get the point. Note that residency records is something which also contained all immigration records in those days.",kaas-schaaf,2025-04-22T04:48:08,2
"> It's honestly alarming how casually we're accepting the idea that this administration will use such sensitive data responsibly  Once the government collects the data, it is inevitable that **some** presidential administration will come into power some day, that will abuse that data. The only solution is for the data not to exist in the first place.   For example, why not have a sunset clause written into law. Once an immigrant becomes a US citizen, their immigration data is deleted after 5 years.",xibeno9261,2025-04-22T07:30:18,1
