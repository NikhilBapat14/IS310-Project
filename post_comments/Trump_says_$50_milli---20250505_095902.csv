"On one hand 50 million dollars is basically a rounding error in the government budget.

"But no one talks about how veterans vote against their own self interest every election and then the rest of us are supposed to feel sorry when they get exactly what they voted for.  I mean seriously last not act like Trump wasn‚Äôt in office from 2016 to 2020, so it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt know what he was like.

"Only dictators ask for military parades. We DON'T have military parades here, except at the conclusion of a war. It destroyes the civilian economic infrastructure, the streets. It glorifies might over right. And, if corrupted enough, it simply glorifies one undeserving and insignificant man. Most countries don't give draft dodgers military parades!  In 100 days Trump destroyed our leadership of the free world. Brought fascism to America. Caused several constitutional crisis. Broken dozens of laws. Made us less safe. A corrupt broken administration.  Trump no follows the constitution, he laughs at SCOTUS while accepting no responsibility: doesn't know, blames lawyers, makes excuses, tell lies, misdirected the media, threatens everyone that won't comply. Enough.  WHEN are his cult followers going to wake up? MAGA is a cult and a religion.

"Yes, and not just his vocabulary. He babbles like the fucking moron his secretary of state Tillerson called him. My description of him speaking about anything he knows nothing about (almost everything) is a third grade bully by who didn't even open the book giving an oral book report.
