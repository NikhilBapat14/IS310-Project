"Strange how they've gone back to pretending that leftist polls are accurate.  The right-wing polls were by far the most accurate in November, disregard the rest.",Zonostros,2025-05-06T08:55:14,9
They won't like that an unbiased poll getting out. The whole rigged show starts to fall apart without funding.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-06T05:08:33,13
This will continue to go up as long as Democrats continue to promote policies that are unpopular amongst US citizens. All this obstruction against the clear mandate the majority of voters gave Trump is only going to improve his position as he continues to fight for those policies. ,According-Activity87,2025-05-06T08:46:10,7
So the real polls unsurprisingly show Trump is popular? Who would have thought not to trust fake polls from fake news media....,MMcDeer,2025-05-06T06:16:01,6

"Reddit: *turns every subreddit into an echo chamber and empowers mods to control the narrative, driving away anyone that doesn’t already agree*  Also Reddit: “Damn, why can’t we influence public opinion like we used to?”",SpecialistNote6535,2025-05-06T07:05:17,72

"Heh, while also arguing for open borders.  Ironic.    No idea how many subs I'm banned from at this point.  How the hell is that not something you can actually see on this trash website?!?  (rhetorical)",bozoconnors,2025-05-06T07:58:59,10
"They had a marginal effect, it’s why they got any investment at all when they went public. But it worked better when it was less strictly moderated.  Not like Facebook that is so ubiquitous they could do what they want and most people still use it anyway.",SpecialistNote6535,2025-05-06T07:29:57,9
