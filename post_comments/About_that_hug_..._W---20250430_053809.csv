"Some added context, because I had the exact same reactions as everyone else here. A national guard reservist that's in our local Indivisible group shed some light on why Whitmer's appearance at this event is a bit more nuanced than it appears.  Selfridge is a national guard base. When Michigan's National Guard members take their oaths, they take one to the Michigan Constitution and one to the US Constitution. Our state's governor is their Commander In Chief. Just like we wouldn't let a foreign head of State like Putin address US troops unsupervised, it's appropriate for Michigan's Commander In Chief to be there when Trump is addressing OUR national guard. If Trump ever tried to send troops into Michigan under martial law, our national guard would have to choose whether or not to block them.  Additionally, the aircraft deal at Selfridge predates Trump, he's swooping in at the last minute to take credit for something that was a decade in the making.  With that added context out of the way, the hug was %1000 unnecessary and inexcusable. For a woman who first rose to political prominence for a moving speech in the Michigan Senate about how she was a sexual assault survivor, I don't know what was going through her head giving a hug to a convicted Rapist.",_DocWatts,2025-04-30T09:36:42,4

"The amount of people who immediately are condemning her without thinking ‘hm, the guy is a KNOWN RAPIST, maybe I should check the recording and see if in context she seemed uncomfortable’, is shameful.    She was clearly going for a handshake, Trump went in for the hug.  It seems to me that she tried to maintain her distance and the awkward shoulder pats seemed like an attempt to end the hug as quickly as possible without being socially ungracious.    I’m sure there are people who would have preferred she outright refuse a hug, and not initiate a handshake.  And that’s fine.  But let’s get the story straight.  She didn’t willingly hug him here.  To me it seems like Trump was relying on her desire not to make a scene to push her into more physical contact than she was comfortable with.  You know, like a fucking rapist.",willowdove01,2025-04-30T14:06:25,2

"“My job is to do the right thing for the people of Michigan,” she told The Associated Press after her appearance with Trump on Tuesday. “I’m not thinking about anything beyond that, and I know it’s hard for people to get their head around.”  Asked about her hug with Trump, Whitmer chose to describe the encounter differently.  She said Trump greeted her first when he stepped off the plane, and he “shook hands and he leaned in to tell me, you know, congratulations and that I was a big reason that we were making an announcement today, and I was grateful for that.”",The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-30T08:25:14,3

"I watched the video of it and why did he go in to hug her in the first place? She extended her arm for a handshake, because they are two politicians greeting one another, and he hugged her. She’s a governor. Would he have tried to hug a male governor? Absolutely not. She probably didn’t have enough time to think of how to respond. If she recoiled he’d probably throw a hissy fit and make her life hell. He contributed to the past rhetoric that her to face threats of kidnapping and harm. I can see why she wouldn’t want to upset him, unfortunately. I’ve been in the position of having to appease someone I despise if that ultimately would lead to a better outcome. It’s very, very clear that the causes she stands for have not changed. She fought SO hard to protect abortion rights for us in Michigan, and helped implement red flag laws to aid in preventing gun violence, just to name a couple. She’s still getting things done, and sadly she does need Trump to *think* she likes him in order to accomplish that.  Edit: I can see how this might look to people outside of Michigan. But I don’t see this as her trying out a future campaign strategy, or needlessly buddying up to the enemy. I don’t view this as a national political issue. She’s securing resources for our state and I’m grateful for that.",Fresh_Ganache_743,2025-05-01T00:12:27,1
