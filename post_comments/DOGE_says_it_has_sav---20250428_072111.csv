"They made cuts without any due diligence. They did no formal analyses and therefore did not prove that there was waste. The $160 billion figure, and any figure they quote, is made up nonsense. Anyone with an ounce of critical reasoning knows how much legwork would be necessary to justify the cuts they made. DOGE is a farce.",irishnugget,2025-04-28T08:06:30,6

So then we save a grand total of $25 billion out of the how much was promised to be saved?,Soulman682,2025-04-28T14:14:14,1
