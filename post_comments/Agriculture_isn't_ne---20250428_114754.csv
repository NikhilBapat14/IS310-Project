I feel bad for those blue-voting farmers in rural areas that not only have to deal with the consequences of Trump's decisions but also have to deal with neighbors who gleefully praise Trump and his incompetence.,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-28T11:52:44,31
"Work crisis, markets are down, manufacturing industry isn't going up as it has become more expensive to buy machinery to start/run manufacturing businesses, falling confidence towards the administration and now empty stomachs... is this a huge miscalculation with Tariffs and Policies by Trump? No farmers, No food.",Merchant1010,2025-04-28T12:00:33,10
">‚ÄúWe had to adjust our employee count down by 12 persons. This accounts for one-fourth of our total employees,‚Äù it wrote. The company said it has been communicating to customers and employees a hope that ‚Äúhasty and reckless decision-making at the top of our country will reverse, easing deep troubles that we are facing at this time.‚Äù¬†  As your workers head for the unemployment office and your company hemorrhages profits and capital, you can't even bring yourselves to say Trump's *name* behind all of this.  Yeah, keep hoping.",subUrbanMire,2025-04-28T12:00:43,10
"The union thing still gets me.   They had an administration with the most pro-union track record in US history, yet  chose to back someone who made it his brand to oppose unions.  That...and along with championing the political party who for more than 40 years has been at litteral WAR with all things union.",5minArgument,2025-04-28T12:30:31,3

I keep seeing MAGAs in my orbit talk about how we need this to get much worse before it can get better. Something about how the Biden economy killed this country. These people are totally lost.,thegoodnamesrgone123,2025-04-28T12:06:50,11
"> No farmers, No food.  No sympathy.  These idiots learned nothing from the last time Trump started a trade war, which ended up with a lot of them being financially ruined and needing a bailout.  The damage is likely to be even more widespread this time around, but capitalism punishes those who refuse to learn lessons over and over again.",TurboSalsa,2025-04-28T12:17:04,6

"It‚Äôs been the best propaganda operation since 1930 Germany.  Give republicans someone to hate, blame the problems on them, break as many of the institutions as possible to help people, then claim only you can fix things, attack free speech, deflect, blame others for any negative news, if that doesn‚Äôt work say it‚Äôs part of the plan.  They have created a situation where the problems are never their fault, and when they can‚Äôt deflect blame they just claim it‚Äôs part of the plan, and when that fails it‚Äôs back to blaming others.  Take any negative story about Trump and go see what his supporters are saying.  At best you‚Äôll get a ‚Äúhe needs to communicate better‚Äù",funguy07,2025-04-28T12:37:57,4
