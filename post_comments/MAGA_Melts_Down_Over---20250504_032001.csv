"there is a german folk/fairytale that is originally written in a northern german dialect ""vom fischer und seiner frau"" (about the fisherman and his wife) where a fisherman catches a big flounder (who's an enchanted prince or something) who pleads for being left alive. the fisherman is a gentle person and let's the flounder go.  his wife on the other hand is a greedy bastard, and when he tells her about the flounder she scolds him for not asking anything in return. she sends him back to ask the fish for a free wish, since they're living in a ""pisspot"" (literally pisspot (chamber pot)). so the husband reluctantly goes back, calls the flounder and is granted a better house.  but his wife is never satisfied. she keeps asking for more and more. she becomes king, then emperor, then demands to become pope. the flounder fulfills the wishes but is palpably getting angrier, so is the sea.  finally the wife demands to become god. that's where the flounder draws the line. and he tells the fisherman to go home to his wife who is already back in the pisspot.  i know ya'll didn't really need to know this fairytale, but that AI picture immediately reminded me of this and i can't wait for having trump back in his pisspot where he belongs.",JenkinsHowell,2025-05-04T04:42:51,115

"Here him out.  Trump has bought the Catholic church.  He paid for it.  In 2016 Francis was making statements that were directed at Trump, Trump made some direct anti-catholic statements.  This happened off and on.  At the time they faced hundreds of millions in settlements for sexually abusing children.  This led to dwindling memberships and closing of many churches.    In 2020 Trump's bailouts to the church were almost 1 1/2 billion.  They bailed them out as a business despite having a tax free status.  Francis and the Catholic Church got very quiet in calling out Trump.  They can continue to exist whereas they would likely pull back significantly over the next years.  Trump is transactional.  He by all means furthered the church and it's goals more than the majority of popes.  If suddenly the church had that kind of surge due to a religious leader, they would give them a role.  The only reason Mother Theresa was exhaulted and and cannonized so quickly was because of the money she brought to the church.  Just like Trump's populist rise, the value and power of the church is by how they make people feel about being terrible.  There is power in making people feel like they are good while being greedy, sinful, aweful people.  The Catholic Church is morally, and ethically bankrupt just like Trump and they are greedy and have a large kitty to feed.    I don't support Trump, but fuck it, I fucking give up.  Let him have the Catholic and Protestant churches.  He can have them.  I don't fucking care.  These are people that believe that ""God is good"" no matter how many times the bible points at stories full of cheating, lying, and causing pain.  The bible has a story of God wrestling for hours with Jacob and magically breaks the guys hip because he was losing.   Morality can be rewritten.

"I honestly believe he truly thinks he’s right about everything he says and deludes himself into thinking everyone else must just be out to get him and liars.   I’ve come to this conclusion based on researching where his insane statements come from. When he says something completely crazy, beyond comprehension, you can usually trace it back to some bullshit he misunderstood or was too stupid to understand  EXAMPLES:   Trans mice - the cancer research had “trans” in the name and he was too stupid to know the meaning.   Eating out cats and dogs - a mentally ill woman ate a neighbors dog one time who happened to be haitian.   Scientist’s are putting shrimp on treadmills - this is actually true but he failed to read why. Shrimp are used to test the quality of water so they make them swim against current using an extremely cheap device and it’s the most affordable way to test water.   They’re aborting baby’s after they’re born - baby’s born with no chance of survival, the mother gets to choose whether to keep them on machines and die alone or to be able to hold them until they pass. Baby hospice is a thing , it’s not “abortion” and the child would pass either way.   they’re putting litter boxes in the schools - one kid brought a litter box as a joke to a high school. No schools are installing litter boxes.   They’re performing sex changes on elementary kids - males born with enlarged breast often are given an options for breast reduction so they don’t get tormented their entire life.   They’re doing sex changes in the nurses office - kids who have to have hormone treatments are required to go to the nurse to take their medications as you’re not allowed to carry meds in most schools. No one’s doing sex changes in school.   I could go on and on. He usually reads a headline or hears something from someone passing by  and spreads his dumbass interpretation without bothering to read the study/article or research it at all.   If someone who’s a professional tries to correct him, he’s so narcissistic that he assumes they’re “hiding the truth and liars” because it’s what he would do. He believes his own bullshit more than anyone around him , even on things he knows nothing about aside from a twitter post title.",khronos127,2025-05-04T07:51:24,212
