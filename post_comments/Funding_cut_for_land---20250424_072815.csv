"We all sense the pattern here but cannot put a single name on it. It's the American Caste System. And it's used to manipulate us all because we cannot seem to see or talk about it directly. But we all feel it in everything. It's nearly all of what the left and right fight about.  The system has a few contributing dimensions. Here they are in order of weight.  RACE RULE: White people above all others. Black people below all others. White people are free to go anywhere and hold any job. People classified as Black are expected to stay away from White spaces and careers. White men can have sex with women of any race but Black men will be punished if they do so. Rules for other race designations can be flexible, depending on a person's position in other caste dimensions.  SEX RULE: Men above women. The world belongs to men. Women participate through being the ward of a father or husband. This is the trad wife movement. And it really was the norm up until a half century ago. Though all white women are above all black men in caste status.   SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IDENTITY RULE: All cis/het people above all LGBTQ people. The existence of LGB people is accepted but they are expected to live and act at heterosexual people or remain invisible.  CLASS RULE: Owning class above working class above the poor. Though this is subservient to the race and sex rules. The poorest white man is considered superior to the richest black person.  CHRISTIAN MEMBERSHIP RULE: For right-wing Christians, Christianity is not about living or even knowing the teachings attributed to Jesus. It's about the status that comes with nominal membership. It's about the right to judge and punish others with impunity - the most basic form of power. It's about believing your actions are righteousness because of your status and not because the actions align with the teachings of Jesus. It also aligns with all of the senseless smiting and bloodletting in the Old Testament. The left is New Testament and the right is Old Testament.  DIS/ABILITY RULE: The existence of people with mental and physical disabilities is tolerated but we do not expect the able to contribute anything to accommodating  or including them.  Once you know the system, you see how everything the Right does is about caste enforcement. We all feel unconscious caste sensations about our status and others'. But we cannot seem to see, name, or talk about the system directly. And that is how the fash get people reacting without thinking and supporting plans that harm them. We need to talk about it.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-24T07:51:17,19

"  >""The major problem, one of the major problems, for there are several, with governing people is that of who you get to do it. Or, rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well known and much lamented fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.""   -Douglas Adams, The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy",bigbusta,2025-04-24T07:30:35,3

How are we losing women voters to these people? What do we need to fix in our platform before the next election (assuming there will be one)?,hendrixski,2025-04-24T08:06:40,6
I hear you. But I am talking about something slightly different. Policies may enforce the caste system or seek to flatten it. But the system as a set of values remains what it is.,OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-24T08:09:06,4
