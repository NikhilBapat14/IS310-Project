"You are being kind by calling it ""math"". It's [total bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TP7IR4gX6w).   Has anybody else noticed that the first two characters of the ""formula"" are the Greek transliteration of **D**onald **T**rump's initials?   # Δτ  Τhe second is in lower case, but nobody is fooled.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-05T09:02:56,1
"Could be.  But it could also be Navarro's simple Trump 1.0 method that was used to train the AI.  Supposedly, according to insiders, more robust models were developed to calculate the tariffs more 'fairly' or whatever, but DT insisted on using 'his' formula.  Honestly, my take is that the simple formula would be easily digested by MAGA, and, it is a lot quicker and easier to post to social media.",crucial_geek,2025-04-05T13:06:43,1
