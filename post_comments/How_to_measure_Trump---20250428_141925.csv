I measure any President or Congresscritter by one thing. How many promises they keep and how many they actually do everything they can to keep and not just give up at first sign of trouble. This  first 100 days is crap. Judge them by their whole term not just a slice of it.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T17:42:50,4

The delta needs to be measured against the first 100 days of a kamamala administration.   I would suggest using parsecs as a unit so the numbers don't get too high.,old---,2025-04-28T14:22:55,-9
