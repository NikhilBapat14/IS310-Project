"Same vibes as constantly putting down a girl at the bar, so when her self-esteem is at an all-time low she is so thankful that you show her attention, she sleeps with you.    I'm truly embarrassed to call myself an American.",Relief27,2025-04-29T23:38:34,4
"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > President Trump has called New York a city “in decline,” Philadelphia a place where “bad things happen,” and Chicago “worse than Afghanistan.” But all three cities show up in his personal municipal-bond portfolio. And during this month’s tariff turmoil, they turned out to be decent places to invest.  > Trump is a big investor in the debt of America’s state and local governments. The disclosure he submitted to the Office of Government Ethics in August lists more than 500 muni bonds with a combined value between $100 million and $330 million. (He isn’t required to disclose the exact value of each holding, only a range.)  > Those investments are a fraction of the president’s total net worth, which The Wall Street Journal estimated last year at between $7.5 billion and $10 billion. But munis’ stability and tax-free income make them a must-have for most wealthy Americans. Trump’s muni portfolio spans 48 states and touches every corner of American life, helping build high schools, airports, hospitals and libraries.  > “He’s a chef’s choice kind of buyer,” said Matt Fabian, a partner with Municipal Market Analytics. “He seems to believe in the asset class.”",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-29T23:30:20,3
