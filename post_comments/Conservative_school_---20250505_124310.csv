"Remember, the hard right's endgame is they don't want to have public schools at all, and they've been saying it in writing since at least 1980.",mmhannah,2025-05-05T13:43:42,113
"By Khaleda Rahman — National Correspondent |  Conservative school board candidates saw a string of defeats in parts of Texas where voters had backed President Donald Trump in November.  In recent years, school boards, usually nonpartisan, have become political battlegrounds in broader culture wars. Conservatives have targeted public education, arguing that parents should have more control over what their children learn at school.  The elections took place in Texas as Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school voucher program, which will use public dollars to fund private school tuition, into law. Republican lawmakers who support the bill say it will give parents more choice by letting them pull their children out of underperforming public schools, while critics see it as draining financial resources from the state's public schools.

"As a non American, I'm keen to know if these school board elections were always reflective of what's playing out I national politics, or has it all just happened in the last 10 years because of you-know-who. Were school boards this resonant when Clinton was in office?",CrowLaneS41,2025-05-05T13:32:35,11
Awesome. This why public education must have  democratically run school boards.,beadzy,2025-05-05T17:27:56,5
This will just drive them to defund public schools. They either get to do what they want or cry foul and withhold money.,blackmobius,2025-05-05T14:49:58,3

This should say “Radical right school board candidates saw a string of defeats to moderate conservative candidates in parts…”  They aren’t losing to Dems or liberals. It’s not a repudiation of Trump even.,sircumlocution,2025-05-05T16:09:28,18
"Yes and no. There's a decent amount of info that states a lot of the conservative movement started on the school board and local elections, then farmed out and up from there. I'm all for seeing the good guys follow that pattern. The only issue is of course that it takes TIME, and its effects are not immediate.",WebRepulsive8329,2025-05-05T13:36:11,10
"The thing to know is that oftentimes these contests aren't even opposed. Most local school boards, especially in rural or smaller areas, struggle with finding members willing and able to serve. Once on the Board, they may rarely face challengers at all, let alone serious competition.  So you sometimes end up with crazy boards, because that's who volunteers.  Then, as long as your district can avoid the spotlight, you can probably serve as long as you want. However, if your district is thrust into some controversy, you'll probably face challengers for the first time in your tenure. And voters tend to dislike controversial Boards - both on the Left and the Right.   I'd be a bit wary of deriving a pattern from one or two elections in a highly publicized school district. But, if we start to see a one-sided trend, that would send a signal to both other school boards and the political interests watching that this policy is a loser at the ballot box.",TyranAmiros,2025-05-05T14:04:29,9

It is a sad state of affairs that wanting mass shootings to be on a comparable level with other modern nations is a losing position here. I dunno what it is about schoolchildren dodging bullets that gets Americans so hard but for the last thirty years we have loved nothing more than watching them get gunned down.    Maybe it's because it makes for an exceptionally good opportunity for people to look extremely caring and deep on social media. If we dealt with mass shootings we'd always be waiting for natural disasters to be able to spread thoughts and prayers.,Evil_phd,2025-05-05T23:03:30,8

"Here in a fairly conservative area in MO all the maga candidates got creamed. As for the ones who won, I honestly have no idea what their political affiliation is, only that they actually seemed infinitely more qualified for the job of running a school district then these nitwits who want to use kids as pawns in their culture war bullshit and can’t actually do the job they’re supposed to do. Turns out people actually give a shit about functioning local government services and will vote you out if you can’t do that.",JahoclaveS,2025-05-05T18:36:06,9

So perhaps it was something nobody thought about -  besides a few locally minded types - until republicans realised it was a good place to gain influence.  Was this a tactic by the party or did it just happen organically ?,CrowLaneS41,2025-05-05T17:46:45,2
And this is the losing thought process. Framing guns only as child murder devices. I obviously cannot change your mind but as an armed liberal that’s not how I see them and that’s not how mine are used.,MiniBanjo,2025-05-06T03:35:17,1
"Getting rid of guns isn’t going to stop mass killings, and I know people like to point to other nations with stricter gun laws to say “they don’t deal with this” but the more important thing that many of those nations have that we don’t are robust social safety nets. The people there never have to feel the kind of despair many American youths feel when they start to realize just how alone, forgotten, and isolated they are. Add to that violent rhetoric spread by right wing militias and right wing racial organizations and it turns people into ideologically motivated killers. If not guns they’ll make bombs, or throw acid, or drive cars into playgrounds. The issue is society doesn’t give a counter narrative to the idea that they are worthless in the eyes of others and society. They feel alone and they don’t realize that it’s the system itself working against them and so they blame the people around them because that’s what conservative media tells them to do. So how do liberal politicians disarm the calls for social change to help these people? Blame the guns and demand guns laws that won’t pass nationally, they get to wash their hands of responsibility in making a heartless system because they’ve “made their stance clear and have fought to protect our children on the congressional floor”. How do conservatives disarm people? Do what I did by pointing the actual root of the problem, the mental health, the isolation, the lack of direction, but most importantly never bring up the solution that is massive government investment in our youth. And so all we argue about are guns.",Visual-Pop3495,2025-05-06T07:44:06,-1
Oh certainly! I worked hard to turn our school board back to some sense of normality. But that doesn’t mean we have any Dems. Just a majority are now competent conservatives.,sircumlocution,2025-05-05T18:41:55,5

"That’s you’re opinion and you’re entitled to it but my Cousin was at the Walmart shooting in El Paso, so excuse me if I think we need tighter gun laws in the face of technology that did not exist when the constitution was written.
