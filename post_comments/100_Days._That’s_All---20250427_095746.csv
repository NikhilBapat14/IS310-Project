"It didn't take *only* 100 days, that's a fantasy that pretends his first term was just sunshine and rainbows, which itself pushes the false idea that Trump even could be sunshine and rainbows. 100 days, plus his last term, plus all the noise he made in between, plus his time as head birther during Obama's presidency. It's all cumulative, it's all damage that hasn't been repaired.

However, FPTP is a bad system that results in governments that are less likely to reflect the will of the people.

"I know how it’s changed but the fact is we are still doing trade and still having tourists and still having access to other markets   The us is still going to be one of the largest export markets and global market makers in the world, countries around the world still hold dollar and U.S. treasury reserves.   That cancels out the validity of severance from the world.  This headline is definitionally alarmist—bad practice. No matter what your politics are   Why bend the truth when there’s plenty of damning criticisms and critical narratives with validity",vitaminbeyourself,2025-04-27T16:42:14,-1
"Do you think there are more people lining up outside US embassies to get a visa, or outside Canadian embassies to get a visa? That is a simply fact. America is still the most important country in the world, the most powerful country in the world.",xibeno9261,2025-04-27T10:46:22,-13

"Ever since Clinton won with a rightward turn and assisted with the overall shift of the Overton Window, Dems have clung to the pure delusion that the path to victory is appealing to the mythical undecided centrist voter. They think handling the GOP with kid gloves and decorum is going to win these McCain-style voters. It’s an illusion. Like how did courting Liz Cheney work out last year idiots? How many times do they need to fail at this strategy? Because news flash, no matter how far right you go, the GOP’s propaganda wing is still going to paint you as lawless, white-genocide-perpetrating communists.",codyashi_maru,2025-04-27T11:51:56,7

Heck - i’m an American living in Mexico and you couldn’t pay me enough to live in the United States right now.

"Yeah Vance is going to be worse. Like way way worse. Because Trump is a motor mouth and alienates people with just one tweet, he's easier to build up a case against.   Vance is slightly more disciplined with the shit he says (slightly being the operative word) and during the debate--for example-- was able to do a good job sounding human and most importantly coherent. I'd rather have Trump get progressively worse so that it's just 4 more years of him than he die prematurely and we get Vance.

"I don’t know why you’re using a strawman argument, not only did I not say that I don’t think it is a severe situation, I in fact acknowledged that I see that things have changed the way you entailed in your first response to me. My wanting the truth represented by journalists actually doesn’t imply anything about whether I think this is a serious situation. I would actually consider whether that is a bad faith argument, on your part.   My complaint is that journalism is supposed to represent the truth of what’s happening in actuality right now, within what they report; not no slippery slope logical fallacies, or fear mongering tactics because those dialectics erode the effectiveness of our information systems, and they help sustain false dichotomies which are deleterious to our capacity to caucus, even within the same party.   你懂了吗？",vitaminbeyourself,2025-04-27T16:58:23,1
