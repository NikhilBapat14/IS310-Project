"Why are democrats not using the words ""Trump Taxes"" instead of tariffs every chance they get?  Trump has instituted billions in taxes on American products and I never hear it referred to by what it is.   A Trump tax.",ScrewWorkn,2025-03-31T14:19:28,31
"And just like that, everyone stopped buying all but the essentials, thus creating a negative feedback.   My family and extended family had an expensive Summer vacation in the Caribbean planned this Summer. Canceled. Spending it instead camping in a large cabin for a few weeks.",WhiteAndNerdy85,2025-03-31T14:04:16,16
"If Trump follows through and tanks the economy which causes the investor class to lose their support, maybe that will be what causes the billionaires pulling the strings to invoke the 25th and get him out of office",Independent_Shock973,2025-03-31T13:47:54,27

"This assumes that Americans continue to buy imported goods at the same rate. Or, goods at the same in general.  Supposedly consumer spending has already slowed in anticipation.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T13:51:18,5
No one in America should have this kind of power. He's not negotiating trade agreements which Congress authorize - and would vote to approve - he's violating them and impacting our entire economic system and lying about why and how much and whatever he feels like day-to-day. This is insanity.,YallerDawg,2025-03-31T16:21:15,4
"This is Trump's third ""liberation day"". Laugh at him behind his back.",Animats,2025-03-31T14:33:26,3
"All because him and most voters in America do not fundamentally understand what a tariff is or who pays them.  Flat, sales and tariff taxes are the most regressive of taxes and always hurt the poor and middle class the most.  What a joke.",Distinct_Hawk1093,2025-03-31T14:44:32,2

"Luckily I pulled out of the stock market at its peak. I'm young enough to kinda benefit from a crash- if I don't lose my job that is. Time to open up a high yield savings account and wait. Don't buy shit you don't need.   If I don't get taken to a concentration camp and made to do hard slave labor becauae of a fascist dictatorship takeover, things might be good ðŸ™ƒ",1Q92,2025-03-31T18:19:27,2

"This is true, until we loot the corporations and the rich.  We can take the money back.",MGSFFVII,2025-03-31T19:07:07,2
Dems are not always good at repeating messages for effect. Just to avoid that myself...  # Tariffs are taxes paid by consumers. Trump just initiated the biggest tax hike in the planet's history.   Memorize that or something along those lines. Repeat whenever you hear somebody complain about prices or the cost of living in general.   Make repetition one of your closest friends.,clamorous_owle,2025-03-31T15:23:20,3

I thought I read that Walmart is reporting a billion dollar loss because people are holding back.,saintdemon21,2025-03-31T14:31:07,9
the crazy part about this is this is what alt right nationalists want. They want Middle America to suffer & pay the price for their profligate foreign-spending habits. It's very warped & twisted... but this is par for the course with hard right Conservative ideology. Just look at the Kansas Experiment and how they burned their economy & state finances to the ground.,wip30ut,2025-03-31T16:38:16,2
"Except they want to tank the economy.  That way they can buy up everything on the cheap, and further enslave us low life poors.",Distinct_Hawk1093,2025-03-31T14:50:10,22
Except he has thousands of armed morons brainwashed to believe whatever he says. If he's removed from office there will be violence.,SilphiumStan,2025-03-31T13:52:16,9
I made all the large purchases I was considering before Trump took office. Only thing I'm buying for the next 4 years is food and clothes.,srone,2025-03-31T14:35:37,4

"Dems have been screaming about this daily during the campaign and still do daily, they can't help if these idiots just ignored it(however recent polling shows the majority of Americans are opposed to tariffs so they finally woke up, albeit too damn late)",FickleSystem,2025-03-31T15:35:52,3
"trumpflation is definitely the easiest and clearest for them to understand that shit's getting more expensive directly because of him, and in the coming months we'll see when the markets plumet to lower than all of biden's years just how bad trump is for the economy",Vorpalthefox,2025-04-01T14:10:56,3

No doubt. This will hurt the vulnerable the most. Most people are a few paychecks from being homeless. The protesting will only gain momentum and larger in size. We will all be deemed terrorists and protesting illegal.,WhiteAndNerdy85,2025-03-31T15:08:41,3

Well it's a bit harder to do when trump is doing something horrendous every single damn day lol like it's hard to just pick one main thing at that point when trump has fucked up something new by the time you wake up in the morning,FickleSystem,2025-03-31T16:05:49,2
