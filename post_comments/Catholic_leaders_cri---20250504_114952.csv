"He deserves more than criticism.  Trump is a blasphemous pig, and any Catholic who would still support such a creature has lost his/her way.",Tla48084,2025-05-04T11:57:47,19
"""apparent AI photo""??? C'mon. Can the media really not tell what an AI picture is? Are there rumours that Trump actually got photographed in the Papal outfit?",Shr3kk_Wpg,2025-05-04T12:36:03,10
This administrations reliance on AI is both telling and very depressing. Just today they posted an AI pic of him for Star Wars day… with a red lightsaber? I’ve never known evil to be this lazy.,missussunsfan,2025-05-04T12:00:56,8
"A ton of Catholics voted for Trump. I suspect some are upset, but I also suspect a lot of them would vote for him again.",Whitey-Willoughby,2025-05-04T12:25:39,4
61+ million Catholics in the U.S.  1.4+ BILLION in the world     That's a pretty good amount of angry.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-04T12:00:48,2
The man just died and rethugs want to say that it's now alright to poke jokes. Anything the dimwit dweeb does is all right with them. Con Don is as shiny white as the pope's robe was.. that's what truly clashes.,FreddieNugent01,2025-05-04T12:12:12,1

“apparent”? Who approved this headline?,0098six,2025-05-04T16:56:31,1
The same catholic leaders that voted for him and would again if he were allowed to run for a third term.,KaiserSoze-is-KPax,2025-05-04T17:20:18,1
APPARENT! Get bent NPR. It's either Ai or a real photo. Take your pick.,The_Path_616,2025-05-04T17:47:16,1
If every Catholic leader speaks out about this it still won’t be enough. Y’all bunch of cowards need to nut up and draw a line in the sand. Either speak the message you claim to represent or back the clown so we at least know where the Christians stand - not that there’s much doubt these days…,theuneven1113,2025-05-04T20:05:04,1
Catholics will still line up in their MAGA hats to kiss Trump’s ring.,Tobybrent,2025-05-04T23:05:05,1
Then when the cameras turn off they all get on their knees for him.,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T18:43:18,0
I think making him a Sith was intentional. His fans want a dark lord. They revel in it.,TruthandMusicMatter,2025-05-04T12:08:11,3
