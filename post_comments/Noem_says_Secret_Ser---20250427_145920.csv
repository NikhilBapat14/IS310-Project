"From the article:  >Noem said she wasn't sure if she was targeted because she was the DHS secretary. She said she felt something brush against her leg where the bag was at her feet, but thought it was one of her grandchildren.  >""I think I was a busy grandma with four grandkids under the age of 4, and I was taking care of them and feeding them food and enjoying my family, yeah, but certainly had my purse even touching my feet,"" she said.  Pretentious Barbie was targeted because she stupidly put her costly, Gucci bag under her chair.  [Sources describe how Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem’s Gucci bag was stolen from under her chair | CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/politics/kristi-noem-theft-gucci-bag-details/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc)  This blatant stupidity underscores why she is unqualified to serve as DHS secretary.",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T15:11:13,20
"it's odd that, in an administration which regularly outs the names of legally innocent people, Noem only says this person is ""a career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.""  > ""For the safety of our agents and officers, we are not in a position to confirm or comment at this time. Should criminal charges be filed, the Department of Homeland Security will provide public information in accordance with established procedures.""  Like what are you even talking about, you regularly name people who you then deport without due process, totally not in character not to name this 'illegal.' This entire things reeks.  eta also weird that this comment has 10 upvotes but the post itself almost immediately went to 0 and remains at 0? extremely odd.   update: as OP I see the post upvote count. this comment: ~~14~~ now 20; post itself remains at 0.  but maybe reddit merely says that for a proscribed amount of time.  https://imgur.com/a/WWsKB4s  eta I don't know if mods screwed with this or what but it's odd that the post was prevented from being up voted.",corrector300,2025-04-27T15:01:41,34

A masked man in an upscale restaurant and nobody noticed  is as fucked up as having $3000 in cash and leaving the purse unattended.,olderdeafguy1,2025-04-27T15:05:29,14

"Leave immigrants alone you disgusting ass. You’re not tough. You shoot pets, flag ICE agents’ faces with your gun and do a photo shoot in front of foreign prisoners in their underwear. I’m sure the people you’re deporting have done nothing as destructive to this country as you have. I would feel much safer with them here and you gone.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-27T15:18:41,6

"Well, that is fine.  Any explanation for why you have so little situational awareness as the head of Homeland Security as to not waste tax payers’s dollars by simply holding onto your bag?
