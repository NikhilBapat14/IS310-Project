"I’ve always heard there’s a lot of closeted gay men in the Republican Party at the higher levels and a lot of the misogyny could be attributed to them simply not seeing a need for women besides producing children.  The dating app Grindr has stated that “the RNC is our Super Bowl” and I read another article that said a significant amount of men on gay dating apps are RW, perhaps even the majority.  And it makes sense- there tends to be a stereotype of lesbians as “hating men/not needing men” but most open gays who tend to be Left-wing have no problem with women. So it reasons that there may be another faction we don’t see that sees no constructive need for women’s rights. And I suspect those men would be Republicans.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-08T17:51:37,16

"I wouldn’t say those women are book smart in any application of that term. Going to college for an undergrad, especially an online college, no longer guarantees that someone is book smart or has any interest in higher education other than how much money it will make them in the future.   You do bookish women (and people in general) a disservice by suggesting that these women in Trump’s circle are book smart and by suggesting that bookish people aren’t really smart (another way of saying that ridiculous idiom “aren’t street smart). Bookish people are quite often PhDs. Bookish people live in the real world but have incredible knowledge and skills on a wide variety of topics that one can only truly learn through years of immersion in reading.   A growing number of PhDs, like myself, came from extremely rough neighborhoods. I had to deal with a truncated childhood that required me to go out and get a full-time job before I was of legal working age to support myself. I’ve had an incredibly rough life, which has meant I’ve had to be smart just to survive.   “Book smart” people live real lives; they also have stamina, highly-developed empathy, heightened creativity, know-how, and an ability to follow through when they begin something—all important skills in the real world.",LadyChatterteeth,2025-05-08T20:42:09,2
