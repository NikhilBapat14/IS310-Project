Concerning.  Don’t expect Cheeto to do anything more than remind the country that Zelensky didn’t wear a suit in the White House.,phxees,2025-04-08T14:07:25,115
"I guess China is openly supporting Russia now, rather than from the shadows. I'm disappointed, but not surprised ",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-08T14:09:52,66
Oh cool. The beginnings of WW3…,jake03583,2025-04-08T14:39:03,37
"There is a huge difference between Chinese citizens who are working as mercenaries on Russias side/in their military (the actual situation if you read the article)   AND actual Chinese Army soldiers as this and other titles are ambiguously hinting at.  And so many idiots are taking the bait and saying this has to be a response to tarrifs, or a sign of WW3. People are daft.  There are plenty of US Citizens, especially former military, fighting in Ukraine but you don't see headlines of American Soldiers doing this or that in Ukraine.",maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-08T14:49:57,50
Very concerning and from what I can see it's this Donald Trump is on the side of Moscow and Beijing not with Ukraine because he has a Strained foreign relations with the ukrainians since the first impeachment and also being linked to Pro Russian figures like Paul manafort who has proxies in Kyiv,AceCombat9519,2025-04-08T14:25:42,10
The take away is its a 3v1 and Ukraine is still winning. The comedian president is clowning on 3 ultra militaristic countries and I'm having a good chuckle.,cuzitsonabudget,2025-04-08T15:04:41,2

Is this why Drumpf is so anti-China lately? Are they being favored by Putin over him?,Zodep,2025-04-08T21:36:59,1
"Everyone wants Ukraines lithium. Trump just escalated this war with tariffs and stupidly taking puttins side , collapsing America from within.",Agitated-Smell1483,2025-04-08T21:39:22,1
Do the same to the Chinese soldiers that’s been happening to the Russian & N Korean ones ☠️,FIF-Choice,2025-04-09T02:00:00,1

Chinese mercenaries have been around since the start of the war. Odds are this means they're hiring even more mercenaries rather than actual Chinese involvement,AsstacularSpiderman,2025-04-08T15:02:07,35

"I mean they could be helping them and then just take over Russia at some point. Except for their nuclear weapons Russia would be a resource-rich, easy target for China, since they would have few allies to come to their aid.",BalashstarGalactica,2025-04-08T15:07:31,1
It could be they are regular folks and former military taking contracts.  Not too dissimilar to Ukraine having Americans and other foreigners fighting for them.,Wandering_By_,2025-04-08T15:28:22,1

Mercs are everywhere. Probably almost every nationality fighting for the Russians at this point because if someone is desperate enough and need moeny enough they will do what they think will make them the most money,MrIrrelevantsHypeMan,2025-04-09T08:59:50,1
"That’s right. China was very happy with its situation before Trump's second term. The U.S. absorbs as much of China’s exports as it can. Over the past 30-40 years, we essentially gave away US manufacturing to China. Then, China learned how to design products and manufacture them.",Didnt_Vote_Orange,2025-04-08T23:44:10,1
"China can just give Trump a hotel or land in Hong Kong.  Doesn’t even have to be big, but it should be called the best hotel in Asia by Big China Hotels Monthly.",phxees,2025-04-08T15:55:46,9
I'm so glad I'm not serving under this bozo or I would have had to refuse orders and take the Court Martial. Feel bad for my son currently active under this fucking clown. Semper Fi but NOT under this administration,[deleted],2025-04-08T18:12:09,12

"True. At one time Alaska was owned by Russia, and Russia had outposts as nearly as far south to San Francisco. North of San Francisco lies the Russian River.",Didnt_Vote_Orange,2025-04-08T23:35:01,3
"https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingiswrong2024/s/HoLZH2T0Ca  Let me let you in on a little theory that I ran through chat gpt. I have been following trends and patterns in politics for years, and odds are someone will discredit this due to chat gpt being used, but I needed a decent way to format large chunks of information. Give it a read, if you think Putin has larger initiatives than just Ukraine.  We are in a silent war of espionage and dezinformatsiya. https://www.jstor.org/stable/26554993?seq=6 Trump is just Putin by Proxy and America a large pawn in their game.",DeadTiredOfThisShit,2025-04-08T17:35:05,6
