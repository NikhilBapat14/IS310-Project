The absentee ballots are for the primary. Absentee ballots for the general don't go out till October,Hypranormal,2024-08-26T22:55:27,7
"That was my first thought, but no. The law in question establishing the 60 day threshold (Sept 6 being 60 days before Nov 5) is specifically referring to the general election and not the primary. It's a coincidence that the last possible day to request for an absentee primary ballot is also Sept 6.",oom1999,2024-08-26T22:58:19,2
"Sixty days isn't a hard and fast threshold. 15 DE Code § 5504 section b says:  >Not more than 60 nor less than 4 days prior to an election, and within 3 days after the absentee ballots, envelopes, and instructions therefore become available, the Department shall mail, to each elector who requests and qualifies for an absentee ballot pursuant   So the Department can start mailing at sixty days, but isn't required to. Obviously with the primary falling within sixty day threshold, I assume they'll start distributing ballots after September 10th.",Hypranormal,2024-08-26T23:16:01,10
