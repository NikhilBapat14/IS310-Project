"This all started in the 70s where the Ultra Conservatives realized they could join forces with the most crazy religious people to consolidate power, pretty much a dream to return to Inquisitions and the ability to use imaginary friends to randomly define whoever they don't like as *evil*.  That's the great thing about religion since they are all made up you can just have it define whatever you want as evil and the followers don't use critical thinking and will follow them anywhere.  It's a return to why organized religion was started, to manage large groups of people and use fear and the offer to be allowed to feel special while targeting all those annoying free thinkers that don't agree with just letting the richest people be in charge or people that believe in angels and imaginary friends being in charge.  Contract for America was the first version and Reagan did a lot of it, which started us down the declining society that all of Gen X has watched happen in real-time.    Everything that made our country strong and stable getting dismantled year after year.  The Heritage Foundation, a true deep state, is the source of all these horrific ideas and unfortunately they have people that know how to use propaganda, religion and fear as powerful motivators to make people hand away their safety and liberty by voting away their own rights.",Adezar,2025-05-06T10:47:43,11

"If Trump dies all the MAGA have the perfect free pass to be mad at the administration, though.   They have Trump because without him they don't have their zombies.",Hi_Jynx,2025-05-06T07:58:17,29
Once Trump dies it all falls apart. MAGA will fully realize they‚Äôve been played by the establishment GOP   and they‚Äôre the reason their lives suck more without Trump‚Äôs cult of personality over them. A base that has been primed for years that violence is the way to act out being upset at government officials. Could take us back to France 1790s instead of the Germany 1930s the Heritage Foundation wants.,MasterofPandas1,2025-05-06T11:14:36,11
"This right here. I mostly believe their little project 2025 will fail because of, well the very network we‚Äôre are communicating on. Not Reddit but the internet.

"I don't see any of the heir-presumptives being able to hold the coalition together. Trump taps into something that gets all the MAGA weirdos out to vote like nothing else.

Thank you! It's truly mind boggling. I seriously have no idea what they are up to. Are they just watching clips of people telling them to hydrate or what the fuck is going on?  This is their time to fight for their freedoms. You know the freedoms they've been so proud of and havent been able to shut up about my entire life!
