"Awesome. Putting lives at risk so the politically connected can be tourists on taxpayer dime:  >Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said it was time for the FAA to “act swiftly and assert control” over the national airspace so the Army “stops running air taxis for military officials” near the airport.  >Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Friday accused the Defense Department of disregarding helicopter rules around the airport and said there should be “no more helicopter rides for VIPs or unnecessary training in a congested DCA airspace full of civilians.”  And these are Trumpers complaining about Trumpers.",1900grs,2025-05-06T06:04:29,42
Watched the video breakdown Captain Steeeeeve did on it. https://youtu.be/p3sY3faRcaA?si=jHvw5u8tZNZ8KcXc  Horrible communication from the helo pilot - ATC did a great job in being cautious and sending planes around based on the helo pilot’s inability to communicate clearly and update ATC when they landed at the Pentagon.,JKlol2,2025-05-06T09:24:42,5
"Unfortunately the real problem is DCA itself.    It is an airport that can only exist under grandfathering.  It was a product of the pre-jet era.  The river visual, like New York's parkway visual, is a very high workload approach in its own right without any traffic considerations.  WITH the traffic, the result is something that should not exist in commercial service.  Instead of building the Udvar-Hazy Center, what should have happened is that DCA should have closed and been converted into the Air & Space Museum annex, with only runway 1-19 retained for moving exhibit aircraft.",SomeGoogleUser,2025-05-06T09:07:16,6
"Good thing that flabby, profligate, overstaffed FAA got the slimming and trimming it so badly needed.",AINonsense,2025-05-06T06:59:13,2

"Swift decisive action? Like the radical 'restructuring' that's been going on everywhere?  They're not going to fix anything. They're intent on breaking America so when it falls apart, the key figures in it can get their own little fiefdoms to rule to their technofuedal heart's content.",KungFuSnafu,2025-05-06T06:36:27,6
"Sean Duffy, one of the original reality show slimeballs turned politician that has helped pave the way to President Trump, now actually voice of reason on not wasting military resources that also puts civilians lives at risk",pierre_x10,2025-05-06T07:05:49,7
I need to see power slap match between Hegseth and Duffy.,A_Tang,2025-05-06T08:11:19,4
