"There were 350 people protesting in my county's capital which consists of 3,900 residents. That's almost 10% of the entire town. And this place is *very* Republican.",myst_aura,2025-04-05T22:28:36,97

"I'm generally right leaning on many topics, but I try to diversify my news outlets and I gotta give credit where it's due. I don't consider the occurrence of these protests remarkable. What I do consider remarkable is the overall lack of riots or violence. It seemed like large peaceful protests were impossible, but I applaud a job well done.",VacationImaginary233,2025-04-06T09:38:03,5
Gives me hope but I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm worried that Trump and his cretins are going to make sure there‚Äôs no more free and fair elections.,word_grl,2025-04-06T06:43:38,3

"Top estimate I‚Äôve seen for the total of the protests is 5 million, which includes teens, who can‚Äôt vote. 75 million people voted for Harris, 77 million voted for Trump. How did Trump win? Republicans successfully trumped up crime anxiety and flipped the suburbs which in turn flipped several states that went for Biden in the last election.",t92k,2025-04-06T09:06:30,3
"There are a few reasons.  Lower voter turnout than from 2020.  Kamala was not a good candidate.  She was ok but didn't say that she could do better than Biden, did not go over well.  52% of the electorate were Women and 53% of white women voted for Trump.

"I disagree with this.  Most of the people who are protesting did vote.  I think that many people were fooled by Trump, and they are telling me that they didn't vote for any of what is now going on.  Trump is a wonderful speaker, Harris isn't.  Trump can move people emotionally.  Harris put people off, even people who wholeheartedly agreed with her positions.  Trump ran on something.  Harris ran against Trump.  Trump was all over the internet.  Harris refused to do interviews until very late on.  Trump had a much longer period to organize and campaign.  Harris stepped in late, and seemingly without the courage of her convictions.    So we have a horrible President now, looking back doesn't fix it, and trashing people trying to fix it now is not helping matters, try to look at the possibility of hope.",Radiant-Specific969,2025-04-06T14:32:28,0
