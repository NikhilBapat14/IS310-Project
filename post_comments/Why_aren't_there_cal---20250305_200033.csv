Youre never going to get 34 states to agree on anything. I’m not even sure you could get 34 states to agree to have a convention in the first place much less agree on some common reform,averageduder,2025-03-05T20:05:35,278
"Republicans control a lot more state legislatures than Democrats, and that's not likely to change any time soon. As such, anything that comes out of a convention would likely favor Republicans, so there's not much reason for Democrats to call for it.  It's also highly unlikely that 3/4 of the states would be able to agree on any meaningful changes.",Moccus,2025-03-05T20:09:18,108

"Well first off, as it stands right now, there are 27 Republican governors to 23 Democrat governors so, that's already a loss for democrats. But even if it was split 50/50, you aren't ever going to get 50/50 states to agree on literally anything so, that's just out of the question. That's a dream kind of thought tbh. Kinda sad but it's just the truth.  Secondly, there isn't going to be a blue wave anytime soon. The blue wave that was expected in 2024 was pretty blood red and, dems took a shotgun and aimed it at their feet and blew their feet off then tried to prove they were still worthy of anything. Dems have a lot of work to do to convince the majority they are worthy again... I hope they do but, I don't have high hopes. I think the only way dems will win anything anytime soon is if they quit putting 100% of their focus on demeaning trump and focus on what THEY have to offer. Until they decide to quit focusing on Trump, they will never win.",Moist_Jockrash,2025-03-05T21:13:38,3
"We aren’t at that stage yet.   First we would need a constitutional crisis. Which we haven’t fully hit yet. Trump’s power grabs are working their way thru the judiciary. It takes time. If that doesn’t work out, then there’s a constitutional crisis as he’s either not listening to the courts or they fall under his control.   Second, pain has to be felt on the ground more. Just the sad nature of it. There has to be an inciting incident for a mass movement, think George Floyd a few years ago.   Third, a constitutional convention is something that is being considered by a number of state legislatures. It’s a conservative project. Under the constitution if we followed its rules for a constitutional convention the votes go by states, with representatives chosen by the state legislatures. It wouldn’t represent the popular will. It would give small red states an outsized power like the senate.",CombinationLivid8284,2025-03-06T01:16:22,3

"The most likely outcome from a Constitutional Convention would be the US breaking apart rather than any serious reform getting passed.  Or more clearly, the Constitution that got passed out of that body would so heavily favor smaller, less wealthy states at the expense of larger, more wealthy states that the larger states would be unlikely to support it.    Basically 34 states need to call it.  38 states need to agree on the new amendments, and those amendments would be lucky to have 50% of the population supporting any of them.  The right would likely try to push the Heritage Foundation's ideas for correction, which have some merits but largely amount to having the 8 wealthiest states supplement the other 42 so they can do whatever they want.    One big issue is the income inequality between the states.  Literally 8 states are 50% of the US economy.  Any constitution that doesn't have at least 7 of them firmly on board is going to be a massive problem, and no constitution coming out of a modern convention would get support from more than 4, and frankly it would probably be less than that due to the vast gulf between what an economically prosperous state needs and Mississippi needs.       If the new constitution is ratified and NY, Cali and Illinois say no, what happens?  Or if Texas, Florida and Georgia say they don't support the new constitution?  That's the big issue, realistically as few as 3 major states could firmly say no because the new constitution is going to vastly impact their way of life, and you have a massive problem.    Which is the real concern with a Constitutional Convention.",tosser1579,2025-03-14T14:51:22,1

"I love the idea of a constitutional convention, but only one with actual democracy authority.   You’re still talking about governors and parliamentary systems—in other words, great people ruling the American people, continuing to make a myth out of the ideal of government of the People, by the People, for the People.   That’s just more philosophical republicanism, when republicans of all parties and ideological leanings have proven themselves just as incapable of practical and fair governance as they have historically accused “the mob” of being.   Claims of indirect systems being more capable have been well disproven, leaving real direct democracy as the only ethical solution. If people fuck up their own lives in self-government, at least it’s no one’s fault but our own.   Once direct democracy was actually impossible—but not any more. How about we use our incredible advances in communication and information technology to get most of the adult population of the United States in convention for months on end until we can form a government that is actually democratic?  Otherwise it’s just more minorities of powerful, rich people pretending to know what’s best while actually pushing their self-serving plans on everyone else by coercion and force. And that isn’t going to improve anything. That will just keep fucking the world up as it has been for centuries.",ResurgentOcelot,2025-03-06T01:06:32,1
"You do realize that if this were to happen, the convention would be the most powerful group of people in the world? There would, in effect, be no checks or balances.   No one could stop them. The army would directly report to them, not the president. The courts, congress, and any elected representative, including POTUS, would likely have 0 control over them. They could sit in power forever if they wanted to and declare a monarchy if they wished, although I doubt they would agree.   The majority would likely be Republicans. We don’t know how many delegates each state gets or how they would pick them either. It is not a well thought out procedure.  Imagine a less representative Congress with 10x the power. That sounds horrible.",Done327,2025-03-05T22:54:19,1
"It’s time we faced an uncomfortable truth, our democracy is in crisis. The federal government, in its current form, no longer represents the will of the people or upholds the constitutional principles it was built on. So the question is — what can we do about it? We need bold, decisive action. And I believe one possible solution is a modified constitutional convention, led solely by the governors of liberal states.  This wouldn’t be secession — it would be a strategic, defensive movement focused on preserving democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law. Imagine states like California, New York, Washington, Illinois, and others coming together to create a framework for cooperative governance rooted in those ideals. At first, this wouldn’t even need to declare itself as separate from the U.S. — it could start as a parallel effort to safeguard what the federal government seems increasingly willing to discard.  But we shouldn’t stop there. To make this effort real and effective, we should establish a shadow government — similar to what they have in the UK. This would include experts, not political appointees. Imagine having an actual scientist or medical professional providing sound, evidence-based feedback and policy to push back on the madness coming from people like RFK Jr. We could have economists, legal scholars, environmental scientists — people who know what they’re talking about — offering clear and thoughtful alternatives to the misinformation and chaos coming from the current administration and its enablers.  This convention could start by establishing agreements on shared economic policies, coordinated environmental protections, and collective bargaining power when dealing with international trade. Over time, it could lay the groundwork for a more formalized union of states if the federal government continues down this authoritarian path. Think of it as a backup plan — a lifeboat for democracy.  And here’s where it gets interesting: We frame this as an exercise in state sovereignty — something conservatives claim to care deeply about — and the right of states to form alliances for mutual benefit. We use their own rhetoric and principles to justify this movement. It’s a page right out of their own playbook, and it could be powerful.  We need bold, creative ideas right now.

"On the subject of division. I think our fractured media has created a fractured understanding of reality.

"True, it is just the state legislature that calls a constitutional convention so Republicans are even closer to the 34 state threshold.    I’m not a fan of term limits either, but a gerontocracy is a much worse idea and we are practically there already.  We saw an elderly Biden and McConnell both freezing up and unable to complete sentences.  They should have left politics a long time ago but the system favors incumbents and party elites.  There can be several Obama types out there now, but they rarely get a shot with a 95% incumbency reelection rate and some lifer Senator using Congress as their retirement home. I can certainly see a state politician wanting to term limit the politician that has been holding a seat they have been eyeing for decades.  There can even be a compromise there that term limits the judiciary too as if you do two branches then might as well do them all.    I didn’t say end the Commerce Clause but better define it.  Like maybe it doesn’t apply to a small time farmer getting regulated out of business just selling a little produce at the farmers market on the very remote chance there is some interstate commerce in their middle of nowhere town.

"That's vague, but OK, I can relate.  The problem is I think every politically involved person in the country can relate but we seem to talking about different things and going in opposite directions.    I was interested on how you would like to ""fundamentally change"" the constitution.  What do you not like?  How would you change it?  For myself, I like the constitution and don't think it needs much tweaking.   That said, I would love if we abandoned this whole money = speech philosophy.  At the very least, we should have some rules about freedom of speech and disclosure.  I have a hard time seeing how being free to speak (i.e. spending money influencing society) gives you the right to have your identity hidden while you do so.  We should know who is speaking if we are allowing them to use that right.  I am also unsure about corporations being people and where to draw the line there.  Sure, I can see how you can make the jump from entities like unions or other large collections of people associated for a common goal having some person hood rights, but extending that to a corporation that only exists to create profit seems like a step too far.  YMMV.  Finally, it would also be nice to clean up what free speech covers.  We know you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, but I also hate that free speech gives cover to people to lie and say whatever they want with very few consequences.  That said, I am not sure I want government to be the arbiter of the truth.  I guess that the best solution to bad speech is still more speech, but that sure has been frustrating lately.",OriginalHappyFunBall,2025-03-06T13:12:52,1
