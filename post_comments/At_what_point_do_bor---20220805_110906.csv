"> What determines which conquests are legitimate and which are not?  Mao Zedong said: ""Political power comes from the barrel of a gun.""  And he is right, as long as you have enough power you can enforce recognition or treaties that acknowledge your new claims.",Hapsbum,2022-08-05T15:41:32,48
"Treaties and recognition by other recognised states. US and Mexico have signed a series of treaties establishing mutually recognised borders.  If you're looking for the point at which conquest became illegitimate, you can go to the early 20th century efforts to form the League of Nations and then United Nations. [Article 2 of the UN Charter states:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_I_of_the_United_Nations_Charter)  > All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.  > All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.  If you're a member of the United Nations, you're not supposed to take land belonging to another member.  Territorial disputes can certainly go back farther than the UN, but the International Court of Justice exists in part to adjudicate those sorts of claims.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-08-05T15:34:45,16
"If it happened before 1945, the motto was 'might makes right'. Which is why some territories were the objects of an endless cycle of war and annexation. Since 1945, with the entry into force of the UN Charter, territorial integrity prevails over border changes by force (specifically art. 2(4) of the Charter).",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-08-05T15:51:59,14
"> also say that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is illegitimate (border changes from the 1990's should stay).  Sorry, what border changes are you referring to? Russia and The Ukraine were not the same country in the 1990's. They were both a part of the same union (the USSR), but they were always separate countries. Trying to say that the history of the USSR justifies Russia invading Ukraine would be like saying that the history of the EU justifies France invading The UK right now.",matthoback,2022-08-05T15:50:49,19
"Legitimacy is what people give. Borders are accepted when they are accepted. It is a political and cultural and economic change. It might be quick, it might take ages. Pakistan and India still do not accept the 1948 Partition.",matts2,2022-08-05T17:00:44,6
"That would be a better question for r/AskHistorians. Based on my understanding though, in order for land to become de jure, it must be ceded via treaty. That was certainly the case until WW2, today, even after a treaty a legitimate claim to territory is largely based on whether it is internationally recognized.  For instance, if Russia and Ukraine signed a treaty and Ukraine ceded all the land Russia currently control, the Donbas and Crimea might be de facto under Russian control but if no country accepted the new borders, their status would be very much in limbo.",Ap0llo,2022-08-05T17:47:56,6
" Prior to the mid 20th century, when the peace treaty which ceded the land and established the borders to the victor was signed and ratified. Once that was done, under the Right of Conquest in the Law of Nations the land and borders were legitimate.   Which is why claims of illegitimate borders today stemming from back then are just incorrect no matter what rationale they claim. A peace treaty was signed, land ceded, borders established and recognized. That descendants of the conquered don't like it today has no relevance. They can take it up with their ancestors who almost certainly allowed them to even be alive by signing a peace treaty because if they refused once it was clear they were defeated, their people and culture would have been eradicated until they did or in its entirety if they wouldn't under any circumstances and the same result as if they did sign the peace treaty would have been the outcome.   Since the mid 20th century all land taken by conquest can never be recognized as belonging to a conquering State under International Law.",DMFC593,2022-08-05T16:41:34,3
Most of the international borders we know today really came out of ww 2.  Prior to that its very much every one for themselves and who ever wins a conflict takes what they want.  With with UN and NATO you start getting the idea that the boundaries of nations are fixed because war is terrible and we rather not resolve conflicts with wars.  so if you get a group of powerful nations to agree on borders then weaker ones will respect them or face sanctions or other punishments.  And the more. Powerful nations agree on a set of rules on of conflict so now others have to follow them.,Whiterabbit--,2022-08-05T16:56:14,3
"I think the situation is more complicated than you make it out to be. It's not necessarily a question of years, or a question of conquest. To look at a couple of your examples, the borders of Russia and Ukraine are where they are not because one nation conquered another but because the Soviet Union collapsed into constituent entities. Israel, on the other hand, was carved out of existing lands by colonial powers as a political solution after world War II. In the former case, we can see this as an act of increasing political freedom. Countries exist where they did not before, or they exist again after the Soviet Union can no longer hold them together. In the latter case, it looks like an act of political violence. Taking from one ethnic group in order to give to another.",Blear,2022-08-05T16:25:54,4

"When you make enough ""friends"" leading other countries that decide to recognize the borders. Every country that exists today, there was a country or kingdom or tribe that was there before,  and another one before that, and before that, etc. It's all artificial, just need others to respect it",NoTable2313,2022-08-05T18:54:55,1
"This is, obviously, a subjective question, but I'd say that conquest doesn't matter. What matters is self-determination. Do the people in an area generally want to be part of a particular country? Well, assuming that country agrees, they should be. Self determination is the best decider because it allows countries to form naturally along lines of cultural or national identity, ideally without the influence of military or historical precedent.  Ukraine deserves to be independent because the people living in Ukraine want to be independent. Palestine deserves to be independent because the people living in Palestine want to be independent. The Falklands should be a part of the UK because Falkland Islanders want to be part of the UK. Texas, Mew Mexico, Arizona, etc. should be part of the US because, as much as they complain, they ultimately want to be part of the US. And if they truly change their minds, they should be allowed to return to Mexico or even just leave and make a new country",Certainly-Not-A-Bot,2022-08-05T19:11:00,1
"The principle generally used for legitimate is consent of the governed.   If the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 had succeeded, it is expected that the UK would start a process of negotiating an independent Scotland. And that referendum has particular power because the turnout was so unbelievably high, the highest in UK history and among the highest in all democracy. So if they had said they do not recognized England's rule, the presumption is that England could not legitimately keep ruling them.  In that way, it's less about history and more about modern inhabitants. The reason Russia's invasion of Crimea is illegitimate is they do not have a mandate from the people of a fair election saying they want to join Russia. The sham referendum they held only had ""join now"" or ""join with a few years transition"" with the option to remain with Ukraine not available.  In the location around modern day Baghdad, I can think of a dozen peoples who controlled that land. So there are two ways to say who owns it by right. One, we let them all fight over it and the winner keeps it. Two, we decide that at a certain point of history we leave the borders as is unless the people within those borders demand a change. The first would lead to endless war, the second much less so.  So who owns Texas? By paper it says the US, and the people of Texas do not seriously want that to change. And if they do want to change that, there's a process to follow. It is not simply who has the best weapons.",auandi,2022-08-05T19:40:10,1
">If conquest claims are legitimate, much of Europe should be in the control of either Germany (WW1 / WW2), France (Napoleon), Sweden (1600's), Italy (Roman Empire) or Greece (Alexander the Great).  They were all losers eventually.",Pearl_krabs,2022-08-06T05:57:34,1
"Whether it’s legitimate is besides the point, if you are a dispossessed people and after 40-60 years you are completely unable to retake your territory on your own…that is beyond diplomacy. The facts on the ground have changed sufficiently to where negotiations alone are impractical. If you want your country back, you need to demonstrate sufficient strength to force the occupier to the table, or to encourage foreign support.   The Palestinians have managed to do this at least 3 times, but their objectives (Israel ceases to exist) were unacceptable to Israel, so Israel chose to fight. And unfortunately for Palestinians, Israel kept winning, and the balance of strength increasingly shifted towards them. Now, even Palestinian allies are beginning to align with Israel, largely because of the threat of Iran, a common enemy.  In Ukraine, the legitimacy of the Ukrainian position is based on their success on the battlefield. Foreign countries are willing to provide support because the Ukrainians look like they can win. If in the opening days of the war Zelensky fled the country, the Russians took Kiev, and organized resistance collapsed, you would still see some support and sanctions, but not nearly as much, much like the Russian invasion of Georgia.",Karatekan,2022-08-06T08:39:28,1
"I don't think there's a consistent way to come up with a ""rule of thumb"" or a cut-off date before which any claims of invalidation of the establishment of borders is null and void.  Instead it's more beneficial to look at the circumstances surrounding each claim and decide based on the particulars of each situation.  It's also important to recognize that what's morally right cannot always map onto the extant reality.  For instance, most serious people acknowledge that what befell the First Nations people of the Americas during the initial stages of European contact was based on pretty foul logic and represented the wholesale wiping out of entire peoples - generally acts which we acknowledge as genocidal in the modern day.  There isn't really a sound way to put that situation ""back the way we found it,"" so to speak. Turning over the US to the control of a coalition of First Nations people and clearing out anyone non-native, though probably the right thing to do in light of history, is not a realistic proposition for a wide range of fairly obvious reasons.  What can be done, however, is to have some national recognition of past history and attempts to compensate the people who felt the brunt of that history through things like special political recognition, reparations, reserved space in the government for representation, expanded sovereignty over specific areas, etc.",HeloRising,2022-08-07T04:32:32,1

"The problem with this question is that you're comparing eras that aren't even close to comparable. It's like why we can't still have colonies because there is a huge historical precedent for slavery. You wouldn't be wrong to make such and observation, but you're ignoring that (most of) the entire world decided to change what is acceptable for countries to do.  Conquest setting borders is illegitimate because we decided to make it so after WW2. The reason is because the powers that participated and won in WW2 saw legitimizing borders changing by conquest as a major source of world war, and so there became a communal agreement to accept that borders cannot change in such a way any more.  Obviously it's not QUITE that ideological. Israel plays fast and loose with this, and obviously there's still be wars and borders have still changed since then. But as a general rule, the reason there is shift in perspectives here is because the world chose a shift in perspectives. There have been a few dissenters here and there, most notably the Soviet Union/Russia, but overall the post-WW2 framework has held.",mormagils,2022-08-08T09:57:27,1

"Don't forget that China is involved now too.  Kashmir is the main disputed territory for India and Pakistan, it was chopped roughly in half and shared but both claim most of it.  China has encroached onto Indian Kashmir and there is a significant amount of disputed territory between them, India claiming it is all theirs.   Pakistan however has deliberately ceded some of Pakistani Kashmir to China, and as they claim all of Kashmir they are perfectly happy with the territory that China is claiming is theirs.  I do find the disconnect on borders interesting.  In the past few years there have been rulings by the UN and the ICJ against the UK and how they dealt with Former Colonies becoming independent.  The UK has told them all to take a run and jump of course.  However, if the rulings against the UK were to be upheld and the precedent followed, then the borders between India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh would be illegal and they'd have to reunify under the same borders as British India.

The choose for the war against the British? I have never heard of that before. I was under the impression that the Jews of Europe were being exterminated in concentration camps and elsewhere by the Nazis throughout world War II. It doesn't seem very likely that they would somehow manage to feel than army in territory hundreds or thousands of miles away immediately after being subjected to genocide and fight a war against one of the nations that liberated them.

"It amazes me how many people make clear bold certain claims with no knowledge at all.  Not all Jews lived in Europe. Modern Zionism starts in the last few decades of the 19th century, about the time the Ottomans belated started to reform. Jews were moving back to Israel in large part because the Ottomans were letting them. The Jews in the Mandate were attacked by Arabs who didn't like that Jews were now legally the equal of a Muslim.  Following WWII Jews in the Mandate area fought a war against the British. This isn't a debate, this isn't an opinion that you can choose to disbelieve. It is a fact. [The Jews defeated the occupying colonial power.](So they are likely going to respond with some verson of ""does this mean you are trans/gay/nonbinary?"" Are you prepared to answer this? Are you prepared for a real serious honest discussion?) Pretty much every European country and the U.S. government for the most part, opposed the formation of Israel. The Jews did it on their own.

I am also curious what you think about this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration  It is the blueprint by which the British eventually established the nation of Israel in what was once British Palestine.  It seems hard to square the idea that the British didn't want the Jews to build a nation with the fact that that... openly said they did, and then they worked for decades to make it happen.",Blear,2022-08-05T18:25:29,2
"Maybe you need to check your assumptions. An armed conflict to affect a political change is a war. You call it minor but that is just a dismissal so you don't have to learn. Wars aren't minor to the people involved.  You claimed Israel was ""carved out of existing lands by colonial powers"". Do you accept that was utterly wrong?   My god! The British didn't establish the nation of Israel. Why do you insist on saying things when you don't know? Britain opposed Israel, Britain supported the Kingdom of Jordan as their ally.

"You know what, I'm sold.  I like your version of history better than the real one.  I'm picturing a Jewish version of the mujahedeen bravely defending their homeland from British invaders.  There could even be a group, like in the movie Inglorious Basterds, that goes to Europe and fights Nazis there.  Maybe they spread the word to get European Jews to fight in Palestine.    Ooh, how about if, after the war, the US didn't get German scientists to develop rockets.  They were actually Jews who had been undercover as high-level Nazis, and subsequently infiltrated the US nuclear program and NASA, stealing our secrets for the newly created Israel.  That would explain how Israel was able to win existential wars just a short while after the country was formed.  The Jews actually created all these powerful weapons, and the US didn't help them at all.  No, wait.  The wars Israel fought against Egypt and their Arab neighbors weren't real.  They were false flag operations designed to drum up international support for Israel.  Actually, it was more undercover Jews in high places around the Middle East who got those countries to attack Israel, but they replaced their normal military units with more secret Jews.  What else?  Oh, the current people who refer to themselves as Palestinians aren't Muslims at all.  They're also Jews.  They're just political dissidents being kept in ghettos and it's a huge psyop that's convincing everyone they're Palestinian Muslims.  This is fun.  I can see the appeal. It's Jews, all the way down!

The Balfour Declaration was a piece of paper 30 year before Israel was established. It was a propaganda message during the war. They also made promises to the Arabs. Do you claim that the British upheld their promises?  I have no idea what British government efforts to resettle Jews existed. Could you provide a source for that?  Now you are saying that the British facilitated the formation of the United States. I'll buy that: the British have a similar role to both Israel and the United States.

"The Balfour declaration was not ""a piece of paper,"" it was the blueprint for the founding of a Jewish nation-state centered in what was called ""Palestine,"" which was essentially the greater Jerusalem area. Yes, promises were made (and kept) to the Arab community after that document was brought to fruition, what they chose to do with the land and opportunities it offered them in the immediate aftermath of that founding was not the purview of the newly formed Jewish state of Israel. The Arabs attacked, Israel retaliated. As for the information you seek regarding the founding of, funding, and populating the geographic area of Palestine which became Israel via mostly British and western societies through institutions such as the Pilgrim society, I suggest 2 starting points, ""The Brandeis/Frankfurter Connection"" and ""Against Our Better Judgement.""

That's it. Do you think this was something Balfour thought up? Modern Zionism was a generation old at that time.   Your original claim was that the British government established Israel.

Read them, or don't, I don't care. Your supposition that promises made to the Arabs were not kept is false, as well, they received most of what was promised to them, they simply squandered the opportunities presented with the lands and chose to attempt a genocidal and ultimately suicidal anti-Israelis campaign that is bordering on the century mark and fails them policy-wise every time.",notthatlincoln,2022-08-08T11:36:41,1
