God dammit how stupid will all of this get??,lizard_king_rebirth,2025-05-07T01:50:25,13
"*The letters fail to acknowledge the strong First Amendment protections scientific journals enjoy against the government telling them what to print.*  Will the liberal naifs never wake up?   This administration routinely violates the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th Amendments.    First Amendment protections mean nothing now that the fascists have taken over.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T07:55:32,2
"He‚Äôs definitely right most Democrats believe in the [Germ Theory of Disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease). I personally was indoctrinated into that belief by my High School science teacher while my brain was still maturing. I went to school in La Mesa which is a suburb of San Diego and we had a liberal School Board so I was not given an alternative theory. Only now am I able to shake off that theory and grasp the [Miasma Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory), but the Terrain Theory is also interesting. I like RFK jr.‚Äôs not letting Science get in the way of picking your choice of Scientific theories and explanations. It‚Äôs so similar to the way my Church explained Creationism instead of that Evolution Theory. It makes it so much easier not having to think about stuff and just let it wash over you, just absorb it, let it soak in. üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",johnn48,2025-05-07T03:35:57,2
Maybe they can go on date to talk discuss this. Just Mary Joe and uncle Teddy did. Oh wait.,Certain_Event558,2025-05-07T04:50:26,1
Someone might get the idea Trump‚Äôs admin is trying to indirectly kill as many people as possible. Why would they do this?,BionicProse,2025-05-07T05:17:01,1
The stupidity never ends but we shouldn't be surprised since Donald Trump was the one who didn't believe the Coronavirus was real at first and even when he did he refused to take it seriously and ignored all the medical experts that told him about thinking he knew better along with all the Far Right QAnon Conspiracy Theory garbage.   A lot of people in America who died of the Coronavirus in the pandemic was his fault 'cause he didn't do enough to stop the virus and protect people.,[deleted],2025-05-07T01:53:58,7
We haven't gotten to the official Trump branded dick and brain pills yet so I'm guessing a lot more stupid.,longtermattention,2025-05-07T03:00:11,2
It will get much stupider.   This is just the first 100 days.  He's got years to go.   And nobody has a plan of action to stop it.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T07:56:45,1
I‚Äôm already rooting for bird flu at this point so the sky‚Äôs the limit.,Rathbane12,2025-05-07T10:39:58,1
RFK Jr is a eugenicist that believes that people with good genes and diets don't die of disease.  I think the simple explanation is he wants to cull them.,I_who_have_no_need,2025-05-07T11:03:24,2
