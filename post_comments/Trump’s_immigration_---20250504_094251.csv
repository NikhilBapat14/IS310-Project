">A POLITICO review of hundreds of lawsuits reveals that despite Trump’s aggressive border crackdown, he’s been largely stymied on the other planks of his immigration agenda. Courts are throwing up increasingly fierce resistance to his efforts to swiftly detain and deport migrants living in the United States. And his attempts to strip legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants lawfully in the country have so far failed.  While a small mercy, the prospect of Trump ignoring the Courts looms fucking large.",zsreport,2025-05-04T09:44:21,11
"Losing?  Are the hundreds, if not thousands of people who have already been deported without due process being brought back?  No.  Is Trump abiding by court orders?  No.  Is Trump or any member of his administration being held to any sort of account for ignoring those court orders?  No.  Are the courts planning on taking action outside of issuing even more court orders and holding hearings about potential contempt of court at some arbitrary point in the future?  No.    Does the court have a viable enforcement method should they choose to actually take action beyond finger wagging?  No.  Is Congress planning on taking any kind of action against Trump's blatant unconstitutional actions and disregard of court orders?  LOL, No.    Until the courts start taking definitive action against Trump *and finds a way to actually enforce that action*, Trump will continue to ignore court rulings.  And as long as they continue to do nothing but threaten more hearings and contempt of court charges that they can't actually enforce, these court orders are about as effective as me issuing those orders from my front porch.    Until someone starts taking definitive action against Trump, he's winning.  Court rulings don't matter if they can be easily ignored.",Justarandommoron,2025-05-04T10:00:19,25

But are they getting due process? Rulings are one thing. Enforcement is another. DOJ amd ICE are part of the Trump SA.,williamgman,2025-05-04T10:30:01,2

Yeah and as we’ve seen the regime really cares what the courts say. The judiciary is proving to be a toothless bag of shit,powderedmilf,2025-05-04T18:41:31,1
