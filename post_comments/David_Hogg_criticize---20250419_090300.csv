It's what's put us through the climate crisis and so much more,"" Hogg told CBS News.  You know he's just itching for an opportunity to say we need to ditch the Constitution and try communism.",triggernaut,2025-04-19T09:06:16,155
"Please, David Hogg: just continue talking. Don’t let anyone stop you. Forge ahead, fierce warrior! Ratchet up the interviews, continue the press conferences, but I beg of you: stay in the media as long as you can!

The only way to do that - for the love of everything that’s holy - DON’T STOP!!!
