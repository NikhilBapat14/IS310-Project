">However, despite owning and showing an official ""letter of no interest"" from ICE confirming he had been allowed to stay in the U.S., Parris' Green Card was taken from him by customs agents at an airport when he returned from a vacation abroad with his wife in 2023.  This part doesn't make sense. There's no explanation for why his green card was taken away in 2023. And trump wasn't even in office then. The drug crime was committed in 2011, so it wasn't that. And he had a letter from ICE confirming that he was allowed to stay in the US, so why was that ignored?

"> The drug crime was committed in 2011  Short answer, ICE has discretion.  A drug offense is permanently disqualifying for naturalization *and* deportable.  You can be a war hero with a Medal of Honor, but you'll still fail the statutory good moral character test under immigration law and you'll never be allowed to become a citizen. However, that doesn't stop you from being able to renew your Green Card. The only thing a letter from ICE might say is that they're not pursuing deportation at this time because for whatever reason, they decided you were not a priority.  Maybe you have that Medal of Honor, or maybe you owe child support.  In either case ICE might decide that it's more convenient to let you stay for a while.  But right now, you're nothing more than a tick mark for their deportation quota.  TL&DR: US immigration laws are a Kafkaesque nightmare.

He wasn't an illegal immigrant. He had a valid visa but fucked up by committing a felony. He's denied citizenship because he commit a felony.

I just feel saying majority is an oversimplification claiming that non voting percentage. And I’m just clarifying it doesn’t and that Trump doesn’t claim the 30 percent of non voters.
