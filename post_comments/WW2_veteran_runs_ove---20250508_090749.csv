"WW2 contemporaries dying out is part of the problem that's enabling fascist revival.  Of course, in the case of the US, part of the problem is that US Nazis were never purged and just laid low for a while. Didn't know until recently how strong US nazis were back then.  We're all remembering the wrong things from history, because to us, it's just stories. The populists are using this to their advantage now.
