"Forming the UCAS makes Shadowrun feel more and more real every day.  https://www.enworld.org/attachments/srna-png.117380/  Context for those not in the know.  Shadowrun is a tabletop roleplaying game set a new future cyberpunk dystopia that also has urban fantasy elements like magic and elves.  Despite its fantasy elements, a great deal of lore has been written for the setting to make it politically ""realistic"", and out of all the cyberpunk fiction out there, Shadowrun has been the most accurate, even though William Gibson (arguably the founder of the cyberpunk genre) originally hating the idea of ""Tolkien meets Neuromancer"".    In the setting, the inciting incident that pulls us off the rails and into a cyberpunk dystopia is a... get this out there fantasy idea written in 1989... a global pandemic that is poorly managed botches the socio-economic order causing healthcare companies to argue that they should be given the right of ""extra-territoriality"" to defend themselves and their holdings after violence breaks out over unequal access to healthcare in America. This weakens traditional nation-states and leads to corpo take over of everday life. Then a far right wing government in bed with the corps takes over America and begins mass deporting and detaining Native American and Latin American peoples in concentration camps! It even predicted Amazon Prime with their first splat book, done up like what they imaged a shopping website would look like complete with negative customer reviews for products and even bot accounts! Oh and AI is ruining everyone's lives too.  Deviating from our real predicted timeline, the ensuing war and many other geo-political events (affected greatly by the emergence of magic and dragons and shit) leads to the disillusion of the US into the United American and Canadian States and the Confederate States of America split off, with the Native American Nations taking the center of North America and Mexico converting to Aztlan after the head of the largest drug cartel decapitates the government and forms a theocratic ethno-state based around brutal Aztec traditions. Eventually the only nation state that isn't totally broken apart is Japan because their traditional Shinto beliefs and technologically advanced corporate power sets them up to become the primary stable economic driver, with the Nuyen becoming the de-facto currency around the globe.
