">The American Civil Liberties Union’s Lee Gelernt, who was counsel of record at the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs who brought the case, emphasized the due process aspect of the ruling. “The critical point of this ruling is that the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is an important victory,” he [said](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-lifts-temporary-block-on-trumps-use-of-alien-enemies-act-to-deport-immigrants-clears-path-to-further-challenges).

Just because I just read. They decided not to review this case based on whether he could deport them under the War Times Act. This was a narrow decision that lifted the pause due to the fact that migrants needed to have their case reviewed in the state in which they are detained. All the justices agreed that due process should absolutely have been applied. I know we're all rolling our eyes but I just want the information out there so accounts don't just throw hyperbole around.,Ok-Assumption9636,2025-04-07T19:50:37,1
"I want to make sure I’m clear—this is a temporary relief and they still have to decide the case, right?  Or did they rule that due process is dead for good and Trump can auto-deport whoever he wants?",demystifier,2025-04-07T20:30:48,1

"Why the rough, animalistic treatment of the prisoners? Can't the ICE Gestapo goons allow the prisoners to walk upright rather than repeatedly and harshly pushing down on the backs of their heads/necks forcing them to walk hunched over?  My guess the purpose is to hide the prisoners identities to lessen the possibility of being recognized by their families and/or others as the wrongfully arrested individuals that likely most - if not all - of them are.",haiku2572,2025-04-07T20:49:38,1

"Just because I read, and understand none of this happens in a vacuum.   You're doing a lot of heavy lifting to pretend that SCOTUS isn't heavily polarized, and normalizing this is people's lives being affected.   ""rolling your eyes"" over the roll out of deportations of people with no due process?     The administration is deporting people, without due process.  This is people's lives...and, maybe someone you know soon.   The only ""hyperbole"" here, is anyone failing to understand and apply the gravity of the situation...especially the people he's deporting, and threatening to report.   The Court is helping him break the law...we can play semantics...but, this is people's lives at stake.  >https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-deportation-salvador-maryland-40136c5aa844b6c12ba20ee67ab4df9a  Homie, you need to read *a lot* more than a paragraph to try and lecture people about the gravity of what these decisions, and actions are in context...and, where it's all going.",MagicalUnicornFart,2025-04-07T20:35:08,1

"They said the plaintiffs need to file in Texas, rather than DC (ever it was originally filed). So it’s kicked backed down.    They did specially affirm that all people, regardless of citizenship status, are guaranteed due process.    So they didn’t entirely cop out but it is majorly fucked that they did not instruct ICE to immediately return this poor man, whom they already admitted was sent to this prison *in error*.",me_jayne,2025-04-07T20:46:17,1
