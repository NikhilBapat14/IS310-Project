Lot of bad to put it simply,ghoster_2toaster,2025-04-29T08:31:01,6
"A lot of rural community are being hit hard with the sweeping cuts and firings, most of them are in actually red states, but the realization there is slower to come unlike in New Mexico rural bordering sections. The sentiment echoed about the food pantry lines captures the overall condition:  >“But I have seen folks who probably were on the other side and are in the food pantry line, and I know that they’re being negatively impacted. And I just hope there’s some realization that this wasn’t good for anyone.”",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-29T08:46:28,2

"New Mexican checking in here, we're out here surviving  Every employer says no one wants to work, the those same employers want to pay $14/hour and strip benefits, sick time, company phones etc.... but If they pay more their business will fail.  We can't really afford rent out here unless you know someone willing to cut you a below market deal- went to a restaurant recently and they are charging $30 for an omelette (not an exaggeration)   Unironically were all growing and trading weed out here like a barter system and surviving off of food pantries and local trades.   If social security gets gutted we're doomed out here.   Tldr were doing GREAT in NM",GamePassGary,2025-04-29T10:56:20,2
