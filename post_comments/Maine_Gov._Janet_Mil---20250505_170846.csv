"This is why I don‚Äôt understand why all these people/organizations were bending the knee so quickly to Trump and his agenda.

">The retreat follows a now-infamous confrontation between¬†[Democratic](http://advocate.com/democratic-party)¬†Maine Gov. Janet Mills and Trump at the White House in February. When Trump demanded she comply with his executive order banning¬†[transgender](https://www.advocate.com/transgender?utm_campaign=SmartLinks)¬†athletes from girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs sports or lose all federal funding,¬†[Mills didn‚Äôt flinch](https://www.advocate.com/politics/maine-governor-trump-trans-sports).  >The victory for Maine is also a win for basic decency and due process. Trump‚Äôs USDA had frozen more than $3 million in funding for programs that feed over 170,000 children and vulnerable adults in the state, claiming Maine‚Äôs inclusive sports policy violated Title IX. But a federal judge ruled last month that the agency had likely failed to follow required legal procedures. Rather than risk a broader injunction, the USDA folded.  Janet Mills, you are amazing! I am so glad to see someone stand up for trans kids and stand up to bullies like Trump and the Christian nationalists.      The rest of the Democratic Party needs to take notes from Mills and Pritzker. Instead of genuflecting to Trump and the Christian nationalists, we don't appease fascists.",southpawFA,2025-05-05T17:12:06,4890

"Trump may talk like an idiot. He may look like an idiot. But don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot.   Trump is exceptionally good at exactly two things: Being spiteful and having been born to rich parents. These have actually served him fairly well in business, and extremely well in politics. In business, this combination has enabled him to cheat people who did work for him and to create an air of material success by treating other people like an asshole. Despite his less than mediocre track record in business, having begun life with someone else's money has enabled him to keep up the appearance that he knows what he's doing. He doesn't. Most of his businesses fail, some of them spectacularly.   In American politics, his natural tendency for spite, and his family money have paid off. Nothing appeals to a stupid bigot like a guy who seems to be rich insulting immigrants, people of color, women, and foreign heads of state.  But, in practice Trump is a loser. His businesses fail. His first term as President was a series of failures, some of them laughable, some of them tragic.   The truth is, Trump is a felon. He's a rapist. He *boasts* about using bankruptcy protection for his businesses. He's running the US economy into the ground day by day, eliminating critical government services, alienating allies and friends with whom we've had close diplomatic and military relationships for decades.  Janet Mills beating him in court is just one more failure, and among so.many others, it will go mostly unnoticed.",Harry-le-Roy,2025-05-06T08:25:34,3

"So she's declaring a total victory for the state of Maine versus Donald Trump because she got back $3 million in frozen USDA nutrition funds? Well there it is she won she officially beat Trump except NO.  When you actually read into the details they got the funds because they dropped a massive lawsuit it's not a win and nothing has actually been ruled on. Basically the state agreed that they would back off from their lawsuit against the Department of Agriculture and in exchange the feds released $3 million in funds. That's it, lol. $3 million for one specific program!  This isn't some big win and it literally has nothing to do with the issue at hand.   The whole contention between these two figures was on the issue of Trump's executive order banning biological boys from competing in girls sports. Well guess what? The legal challenge when it comes to transgender athletes in Title 9 is still very much alive!  Trump's DOJ and the Department of Education are moving forward with a separate lawsuit against the state of Maine for violating federal education rules and wrapped up in that lawsuit is over $250 million in annual federal education funding. This Department of Agriculture and USDA deal has nothing to do with the issue at hand. So no, Janet and you mindless Democrats who simply just buy this stuff hookline and sinker. YOU DIDN‚ÄôT WIN.  In fact in the unfreezing of this $3 million in funds you had to give something up. You had to surrender you had to drop a lawsuit in order to get that released but of course facts be damned here she is pumping her fists and the leftoids seem to betripping over themselves as they fawn over her excellence, lol.  Oh what a real hero against fascism. Lmao. It's the same freaking song and dance every time and obviously it's a grift.  I'm pretty sure Janet Mills is just playing the game. It's all performance.  Let's drop the lawsuit, get that $3 million unfrozen, and then we could pretend as if we've scored some massive victory against the Trump people though our mindless low-information uneducated voters will definitely go for it and cheer us on. And of course, just as predicted that's exactly what happened.

"Once again posting this because the ""trans women have a biological advantage over cis women"" never considers actual scientific research which directly disproves that talking point:   From a [meta-study examining whether trans women on HRT have athletic advantages over cis women.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10641525/):  ""While it is true that certain morphological changes that occur during puberty may be irreversible, trans individuals on gender affirming hormone therapy clearly do not retain the same physiologic parameters as their pre-transition counterparts.. excluding trans individuals does not prevent cases of athletes having hormonal advantages. Cisgender individuals naturally vary in their hormonal profiles ... Thus, restricting trans individuals is unlikely to prevent issues of ergogenic hormonal advantages in sports.""  ""Both studies seem to agree that relative aerobic capacity of trans women is decreased to levels similar to those of cis women... Alvares goes further and quantifies hemoglobin levels showing that trans women have similar hemoglobin to cis women... and less than cis men.""  ""A study by Harper et al. examined runners' race times across transition from men to women to determine how transitioning affected their performance ... As trans women, they were performing at a similar competitive level, compared to other cis women, as they had as cis men compared to other cis men.""  There are some examples in this paper of trans athletes out-performing their cis counterparts but it's the exception rather than the rule. The paper also points out that there will always be biological advantages that some athletes (cis or trans) have over others, so focusing just on a few potential benefits some trans athletes may have is disproportionate and logically inconsistent.",Mutant-Cat,2025-05-05T18:38:02,19

"The problem is that the sports ban is a dog whistle. If all the MAGA folks wanted was to prevent transwomen from competing in professional sports, that would be one thing. However, what the bigots who cleverly invented the trans sports controversy wanted was an opportunity to shut trans people out of public life. If they get a professional sports ban passed, that won't be the end of the focus on stifling trans rights. They'll just switch to campaigning on banning trans children from all sports, and they'll use the professional sports ban as an excuse to make us easily identifiable--rather than do karyotypes at every professional event, which is the craziness they'd need to do to ban trans women, they'll force us to have something on our passports and driver's licenses that marks us as trans. Because this isn't about professional sports and never has been. That's why Newsome's stance is enough to make me never vote for him--not because I'm greedy enough to think my potential right to play in professional sports is worth another MAGA presidency, but because I'm a realist who knows that if Newsome wins my right to exist will still be under threat.

You have literally stated zero facts beyond you saying that you were having fun laughing at other people's misfortune.

"Honestly, it's pretty amusing how you cling to this notion of ""intellectual maturity"" while throwing around baseless accusations. You think a book can absolve you of the flaws in your arguments? That's adorable.   As for Janet Mills, isn't it refreshing to see a leader actually fighting for the rights of marginalized groups, unlike the Republicans who seem to thrive on division and fear-mongering? She's restoring school meal funds and standing up for trans kids‚Äîwhat a breath of fresh air!   And your constant deflection to ""criminal illegal alien"" just shows how little you understand about the complexities of immigration and justice. Keep grasping at those straws; they‚Äôre all you‚Äôve got, it seems.   But hey, if you want to keep living in that reductive bubble, go ahead. Just don‚Äôt expect the rest of us to join you in your misinformed tirades. Maybe try to engage with some real facts next time instead of relying on talking points that even your own party seems embarrassed to defend.",Otherwise_Dot4091,2025-05-06T03:47:55,2

What hardships do you think the Trump administration is creating for me personally?   What elections do you think were swayed by my personal disdain for pathetic people like yourself?  But the real question is what personal failings have you experienced that have caused your overwhelming feelings of helplessness and low self-esteem that would lead to the behaviors you've exhibited in these threads.
