"No, its yet another ignorant, rude and hateful comment from King Chump that shows what an ass he really is. See excerpt from the linked web site -- Catholics consider the Pope God's chief representative on earth.  ""All Catholics are taught to revere the pope as the sole Vicar of Christ (God‚Äôs chief representative to the world).""  For Trump to joke about his wish to be Pope -- in light of his serial adulteries, sexual molestation of women, history of crooked business deals, stiffing contractors and creditors, stirring up racism and xenophobia for political gain; and worst of all, public statements that he never asks God for forgiveness, makes me sick to my stomach, even though I left the Catholic Church about 50 years ago (eventually converted to United Methodism.)

"I'm not sure how I feel on religion these days, though I do respect it and learn about it.  I've sat through many Bible studies, I've actually read the Bible, various translations, and I know a lot of the differences and the histories.  I read a lot and I like digging into the history of various customs and language.  That said, Trump is legitimately ticking all of the boxes for the antichrist, one by one.  I never thought I'd feel this way but it's a bit freaky how closely he's matching up.  I feel like I'm crazy watching this happen as people who identify as Christian are ok having anything to do with him.  I legit didn't think there was any such thing as an antichrist and now I'm starting to second guess myself because it's all so perfectly matching up.  I know it's not all Christians, I have some very devout family members who can't stand him and never have.  I'm sure they're not the only ones, but I cannot believe the number of Christians who don't understand that this man is adding up to be the one thing they are supposed to be railing against.

Then once THAT gets normalized in his base, 45 talking about it, he goes making it an EO.

Kind of predictable....   So no. He may PLAY IT OFF as a joke, but in actuality, it's the opening ùíîùíÇùíçùíóùíê. And a new angle of attack. Remember that it's the biggest single religious affiliation for Hispanics? Yeah. AND American Protestants have been suuuuper wary of Catholics BECAUSE of their loyalty to the Pope until even AFTER JFK was JFK'D. Claimed dual loyalties meant that Catholic US presidents would obey the Pope rather than follow the good of the country. Which... didn't really happen.¬†   45 is priming his Catholic voters to ignore him attacking the next Pope and casting their cards with him. Can't have them haring off should the next pope call him out! Wouldn't put a Henry VIII endgame past him either.

"Not all Catholics. As I said, the CRITICAL THINKING is a significant factor here, just as in every other demographic. Other factors include AGE (hooboy ain't that a biggie, thank you *ever so much, FoxNews*/s, race and socioeconomic status... just like America as a whole.¬†   Honestly, as a practicing Catholic I've found significant variation simply depending on what church and Mass I'm attending because of the population variances, and perhaps also because of the subliminal preferences of pastoral homily topics. I can't run a study, of course, but bumper stickers are quite telling these days (I am almost always late because I have basically NO internal clock, so I get to see most of the attendees' cars). Most of the churches are in the same area of SoCal. The one at the University campus tends to run more liberal (the priest at my favorite mass spent most of Lent making subtle remarks critiquing MAGA tendencies and ideologies, :D), but still has a good number of pro-life single issue voters. Another parish with a much older (on average) white¬†congregation still has pro-life signs outside. A third is in a poor neighborhood and serves a largely brown population, of which I haven't stopped at in a while, but from what i remember should see more¬† individuals dissatisfied with Trump.¬†   And another church I REFUSE to attend but hear about from a family member has people who are outright racist... apparently elderly white TradCatholics who schismed with the Church in the 60s are just that extra. /s   All in all,¬† the situation matches up well with what we see here:¬† https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/party-identification-among-religious-groups-and-religiously-unaffiliated-voters/   Sadly, I posit that fresh training in critical thinking or a formal education have called many Catholics with the left, which while not a majority is still likely a huge number of Americans. Actually experiencing the reality of racism personally generally shifts targeted demographics left, regardless of education, but a lack of education makes one more inclined to miss that ""just because they say they dislike the same folks you do doesn't mean they're not going to go after you and yours.""   Seriously, it is like Catholics here have forgotten that THEY used to be persona non grata in this country for most of its history.   TLDR; I said critical thinking Catholics, not MOST Catholics. Many like to pretend they're reasonable, but would cut off their own nose rather than look beyond their own circle or think critically about the information they recieve and how it compares to the beliefs they espouse. But there are ALSO those who have already been threatened by right-wingers for something or other, or are incredibly kindhearted, who will also be able to point to issues and say ""that may be against the church's teachings, but this is WORSE."" Really, it's sadly not that different to the rest of America in that respect.¬†   CRITICAL thinking. Education. Empathy and Humility.¬†   ¬†¬† Failings for America, not just Catholics.
