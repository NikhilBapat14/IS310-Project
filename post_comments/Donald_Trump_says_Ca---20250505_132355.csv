"No, its yet another ignorant, rude and hateful comment from King Chump that shows what an ass he really is. See excerpt from the linked web site -- Catholics consider the Pope God's chief representative on earth.  ""All Catholics are taught to revere the pope as the sole Vicar of Christ (God’s chief representative to the world).""  For Trump to joke about his wish to be Pope -- in light of his serial adulteries, sexual molestation of women, history of crooked business deals, stiffing contractors and creditors, stirring up racism and xenophobia for political gain; and worst of all, public statements that he never asks God for forgiveness, makes me sick to my stomach, even though I left the Catholic Church about 50 years ago (eventually converted to United Methodism.)

"I'm not sure how I feel on religion these days, though I do respect it and learn about it.  I've sat through many Bible studies, I've actually read the Bible, various translations, and I know a lot of the differences and the histories.  I read a lot and I like digging into the history of various customs and language.  That said, Trump is legitimately ticking all of the boxes for the antichrist, one by one.  I never thought I'd feel this way but it's a bit freaky how closely he's matching up.  I feel like I'm crazy watching this happen as people who identify as Christian are ok having anything to do with him.  I legit didn't think there was any such thing as an antichrist and now I'm starting to second guess myself because it's all so perfectly matching up.  I know it's not all Christians, I have some very devout family members who can't stand him and never have.  I'm sure they're not the only ones, but I cannot believe the number of Christians who don't understand that this man is adding up to be the one thing they are supposed to be railing against.  My whole life I've put up with people overly obsessed with the idea of Satan and evil to the point that they want to control everyone around them to avoid it, but the minute actual, identifiable evil shows up, they're ready to put it on a pedestal.",Confident-Beyond6857,2025-05-05T14:28:42,21

">Can I ask why it’s funny?  Catholic Church is bad it hoards wealth and rapes children  The pope is an inherently goofy concept, it is not worthy of default respect  Catholics are a huge part of why Trump is in office in the first place, if they want politicians to leave them alone they should get the fuck out of politics   This isn't even offensive, there's nothing mean in it, it's just dumb  Getting offended by this is pathetic and hypocritical.

"Nah, dude. 45 has a pattern:   1. Make a joke about something   2. Then his base starts talking about it   3. Once semi-normalized in his base discourse, 45 starts talking about it semi-seriously in the way of ""yeah, some people are suggesting this, good people, datdatxat word salad...""    4. Then once THAT gets normalized in his base, 45 talking about it, he goes making it an EO.   In the meantime, during the shock of step 1, he uses it to distract from some OTHER unlawful shit he is sneaking onto the books. I'm thinking the EO from April 28 is a likely candidate, but it could be one of the ones targeting the judicial branch.    That's the cycle dude. Takes about a month on average. Kind of predictable....   So no. He may PLAY IT OFF as a joke, but in actuality, it's the opening 𝒔𝒂𝒍𝒗𝒐. And a new angle of attack. Remember that it's the biggest single religious affiliation for Hispanics? Yeah. AND American Protestants have been suuuuper wary of Catholics BECAUSE of their loyalty to the Pope until even AFTER JFK was JFK'D. Claimed dual loyalties meant that Catholic US presidents would obey the Pope rather than follow the good of the country. Which... didn't really happen.    45 is priming his Catholic voters to ignore him attacking the next Pope and casting their cards with him. Can't have them haring off should the next pope call him out! Wouldn't put a Henry VIII endgame past him either. Also probably appealing to the old-school evangelical base.    We should be using this. 70,412,000 registered Catholics in the USA in 2017... if we can get even a 10th on board and active, that's halfway to a general economic standstill activity usually employed by unions.",ArmyofRiverdancers,2025-05-05T23:53:49,1

"Not all Catholics. As I said, the CRITICAL THINKING is a significant factor here, just as in every other demographic. Other factors include AGE (hooboy ain't that a biggie, thank you *ever so much, FoxNews*/s, race and socioeconomic status... just like America as a whole.    Honestly, as a practicing Catholic I've found significant variation simply depending on what church and Mass I'm attending because of the population variances, and perhaps also because of the subliminal preferences of pastoral homily topics. I can't run a study, of course, but bumper stickers are quite telling these days (I am almost always late because I have basically NO internal clock, so I get to see most of the attendees' cars). Most of the churches are in the same area of SoCal. The one at the University campus tends to run more liberal (the priest at my favorite mass spent most of Lent making subtle remarks critiquing MAGA tendencies and ideologies, :D), but still has a good number of pro-life single issue voters. Another parish with a much older (on average) white congregation still has pro-life signs outside. A third is in a poor neighborhood and serves a largely brown population, of which I haven't stopped at in a while, but from what i remember should see more  individuals dissatisfied with Trump.    And another church I REFUSE to attend but hear about from a family member has people who are outright racist... apparently elderly white TradCatholics who schismed with the Church in the 60s are just that extra. /s   All in all,  the situation matches up well with what we see here:  https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/party-identification-among-religious-groups-and-religiously-unaffiliated-voters/   Sadly, I posit that fresh training in critical thinking or a formal education have called many Catholics with the left, which while not a majority is still likely a huge number of Americans. Actually experiencing the reality of racism personally generally shifts targeted demographics left, regardless of education, but a lack of education makes one more inclined to miss that ""just because they say they dislike the same folks you do doesn't mean they're not going to go after you and yours.""   Seriously, it is like Catholics here have forgotten that THEY used to be persona non grata in this country for most of its history.   TLDR; I said critical thinking Catholics, not MOST Catholics. Many like to pretend they're reasonable, but would cut off their own nose rather than look beyond their own circle or think critically about the information they recieve and how it compares to the beliefs they espouse. But there are ALSO those who have already been threatened by right-wingers for something or other, or are incredibly kindhearted, who will also be able to point to issues and say ""that may be against the church's teachings, but this is WORSE."" Really, it's sadly not that different to the rest of America in that respect.    CRITICAL thinking. Education. Empathy and Humility.       Failings for America, not just Catholics.   No wonder 45 ""loves the uneducated.""",ArmyofRiverdancers,2025-05-06T16:56:25,1

"He's actually (openly) pro-choice, which you should explain to your parents. He just believes that there shouldn't be a federal mandate, and laws should be left up to the states. He opposes late-term abortion (most people do unless it's a life-threatening emergency), but he has countless mistresses that have come forward saying he paid them to have abortions.  The pro-life/choice argument in the US is actually about decentralization of power v civil rights. It has very little to do with morality in a legal and political sense.

"For some of these people, their faith in Trump has has somehow remained completely unwavering through everything he’s done to date. They live in communities where every single person around them fully believes in him, their congregations fully believe in him and push that faith onto them. They don’t get the same news we do if they get any news at all, which is why it’s been so hard to break through to them. These are the people that have literally chosen Trump over family, that have even further isolated themselves in the movement.   The fact that this is breaking people out of the illusion at all is massive seeing as almost nothing else has, regardless of how you feel it *is* offensive to Catholics. To call them clowns and idiots, and further rag on their beliefs, is a complete waste of a huge opportunity. If a window has been opened to finally get through to some voters, hitting them with “I told you so,” “you’re a clown for feeling this way,” “your religion is stupid,” etc. slams that window shut. It’s human nature to pull back out of spite when hit with smugness.
