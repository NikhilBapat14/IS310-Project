"I still want to hear a robust and final explanation for why ""the pain is worth it.""   I know the topical response is to somehow level trade and there is some nebulous idea that someone somewhere has a plan to ""bring back American jobs,"" but I don't buy any of that. Trump doesn't represent everyone and he's stated and acted as such many times.   I deeply suspect that this is a crisis to create a dependency on Trump to alleviate supply line resources to individual states and starve people into compliance with the mandates of Project 2025 and the mirror goals of big tech authoritarians. This and just about everything else this mf has done is treasonous.   It is treason to break our country. This should have required an invasion. There is no election that can justify this level of crookedness and damage done to the United States by this Weekend at Bernie's narcissist that shadowy organizations are propping up to implement an agenda nobody in this country would, if given an explanation out loud, ever support.  It's about to get real weird here.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-01T08:31:16,38
"It'll be worth it once we all have factory jobs. Or it'll all be worth it once we collect billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, which will be spent on something that'll surely be announced soon.",30mil,2025-05-01T08:39:00,7

"Exactly, but also, there isn't enough time to do that to stave off what is coming. We would need years to build out the infrastructure and personnel training to even consider it.  But I guess if the techies think they can build autonomous robots with the requisite engineering to replace humans, it might be a much shorter script.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-01T09:30:56,5

Because it will bring back companies to the US!  Just like it did 8 years ago when he added tariffs. ALL the hundredths of companies affected immediately made factories here. So tariffs do work!

Why are you asking a question you know the answer to?   The Trump admin has never been truthful other than when they say get the fuck outta my country.,unpluggedcord,2025-05-01T08:50:52,8
"> some nebulous idea that someone somewhere has a plan to ""bring back American jobs""  There aren't even ""concepts of a plan"" on this one.    You can't ""make enough money on tarriffs to eliminate income taxes"" AND tariff foreign products enough to encourage domestic production AND make the bestest deals on tariffs simultaneously.  Those three are all mutually exclusive goals, yet Trump has been promising all 3.  Moving the needle on any of those things individually causes the others to get worse.",tomz17,2025-05-01T10:13:16,5
"When you remember that we lost over a million people to COVID and a lot of them were people huffing trumps shit until they literally choked to death, then it becomes clear these people don't have reason and will gladly go to the grave suffering if it means falling at Trumps feet.

It’s a disconnect between perception and reality. The romanticized era of prosperity they are referring to (1950’s) was associated with the amount of manufacturing that was in the US. What is left out is the prevalence of unions and other worker’s rights. People think that bringing back manufacturing will return America to that prosperous time. But their refusal to also bring back the other half of that equation will more likely bring about more economic inequality. ,BleachedUnicornBHole,2025-05-01T09:43:14,5

"Problems: Homelessness, joblessness, dependency on foreign production.  Solution: Build factories to make everything and incorporate living facilities in the factories.

"What company would invest the money to do so when Trump is simultaneously promising to negotiate the bestest deals?  If you move production to the USA and he cuts a deal for cheaper imports from somewhere else, your investment has instantly gone up in smoke.    Similarly, if the US government can replace income taxes with tariffs (another thing they have been promising), that means that imported products still have to sell well enough to generate that tariff revenue.  That's literally the opposite of the protectionism you need to make a domestic industry viable when competing against cheaper production somewhere else.   It's all just a pile of self-contradictory nonsense.",tomz17,2025-05-01T10:16:06,9
"I know, and that is one of his/their strongest tools - ambiguity. This leaves his base in a position to project their fears, hatreds, fantasies, and ideas onto a moving, malleable canvas. They seem to think they alone can interpret the motivations of the regime as though reading tarot cards that ""liberals"" simply cannot decipher.   I want them to state it out loud, though I know they never will. They will just break and do, knowing that to clearly lay out their agenda would mean breaking the spell their ambiguous cruelty put on Trump's supporters.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-01T08:55:45,4

"True, but the ocean-crossing container ships that do the US/China routes are enormous.   The biggest heavy-lift semi-submersible ship is dwarfed by these 400 meter long monsters.  Empty they are still 55,000 tons.  Blue Marlin could theoretically carry the weight (DWT 70,000 tons), but there would be no way to support its length so it would break in two.
