Her loss makes perfect sense if you remember how early she flamed out in the 2020 primary among the Democratic base. She was never even popular in her own party. She just isn’t good at executive politics where you need decisive strategy and a vision. Look at all the anonymous leaks during the campaign where senior staff criticized her inability to make decisions. She’s better as AG or in the Senate.,Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-04T08:26:13,5
"She was doing alright in her first couple of weeks.  The ""Trump is weird"" thing worked for a bit, and they probably could have played that into something else, more substantive...but they didn't.

The only mistake made is that the democrats didn't give republicans cabinet positions! Maybe the 2020 election was stolen after all, that's a \*valid\* viewpoint!

I don't like Harris, at all, and think she was a bad candidate. But while it was largely her fault, that isn't the whole story.

It would be simply MAGA level stupidity and expected for the ""political junkies"" to not only support a Harri primary but also voting for her because of the myth that she is some sort of victim rather than a horrible candidate.
