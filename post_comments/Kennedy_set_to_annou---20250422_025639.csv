"It is a *voluntary ban,* which food companies have already previously ignored. It allows a one year phase which will be extended repeatedly  So, no, *there is no ban* and no prospect of this every being enforced.  However, since California and other states are moving to ban within their states food companies will probably decide on their own to stop using them. Maybe, once all supplies of banned ones are gone. Then Kennedy will take credit for the victory.   This is the case for two ""banned"" dyes which are used so rarely companies have stopped using them altogether.  Also, the FDA has complete authority to ban them at any time. Except now apparently.  Surprise.

The US stopped using it in 2000.  The Salk vaccine is an injection of inactive polio (IPV) developed in the 1950s but had its own problems in the 1950s-1960s due first to contamination with live polio and then to unknowingly transfering a rhesus monkey virus (neither of which was the fault of the vaccine composition itself, but production issues with the technology of the time). For those reasons IPVs weren't popular with the public and thus were not widely used in the US from the mid 1960s until enhanced IPVs were introduced, which was in 1987 not in 1992.

Increasing regulations why decreasing staffing sizes doesn't sound particularly good.   However, what I am saying here is not meant with the intention of saying that reducing the number of artificial food dyes in our food is bad, and nor am I criticizing them for making this decision. All I'm saying is that the effect of their intended regulations may not be as great as they hope if they continue to cut down on the number of federal workers we have.",Odd-Passage4975,2025-04-22T21:21:35,1
"Why should anyone who supports the authoritarian regime they help build deserve any bit of praise?   If we start cherry picking the few pros from a large list of cons, we normalize this chaos that they want to sow. The point stands and no sensible person one can deny that.  While I agree with regulations these wildly unhealthy ingredients, it would be nice if those who bought into this cult could acknowledge the hypocrisy when they criticized the Biden administration for trying to limit vapes from being marketed to children but then support the guy who thinks autists can’t pay taxes is trying to **regulate** for the kids.   End of the day, this is as much theater because the FDA has been crippled to the point of inspections being nearly phased over to private inspectors, who are always understaffed, and so the government would have no way to police whatever ban is being announced. So why should I praise this again?",RacingGrimReaper,2025-04-22T19:59:47,0

"There are a few food dyes I think have enough evidence for being bad in high enough concentrations (granted far higher than exists in food but I digress) but the vast majority of food dyes are pretty uncontroversially safe per the state of modern science. Arguing anything else is just naturalistic fallacy. Natural isn’t shorthand for safe and good and synthetic isn’t shorthand for dangerous and bad.  Painting an entire category of things, such as artificial dyes, with a broad brush as dangerous because they are artificial is just another form of science denial.",jonermon,2025-04-22T03:37:04,21

"This thread is literally mostly people saying they're fine with banning many food dyes but that it feels like token bullshit that doesn't actually move the needle much on health in this country. People aren't being tribal. Nobody is defending corporations that will gladly poison us if they can make a buck.  But it's difficult to take someone seriously about the health of people in this country when 1- they're anti-vax and 2- they aren't talking at all about the things that cause the most harm to our health. I'll take RFK Jr and his ilk seriously when they start advocating for universal healthcare, climate initiatives, workers' rights, clean drinking water etc.   Europeans don't live longer than us because of fluoride and food dyes. They live longer because they have easier access to healthcare, better working conditions, more time off, and less reliance on cars, among other things. So sure, get rid of food dyes. But it's not going to change much. And it's not tribal to point that out.  Also, ""normalizing autism"" as a bad thing? Fuck right out of here with that shit.

"First off, I think we got in a debate before - mutual respect.  Anyway, here is my thought on the staff reductions: I don't know about others here, but I have worked in corporate America for the last 15 or so years.  This is how layoffs happen.  I don't like it, I don't think it's right - truly - but it's what happens.  It's nearly always done with a sledgehammer, and then everyone picks up the pieces and figures out how to move forward.  I am in a cyclical industry, and I have been through 7 mass layoffs.  Decreasing head count is always ugly, often ineffective at actually reducing costs, and frequently affects productivity of the department/company vastly more than the headcount %.  But it's ugly work, and it's frequently expedited, delayed, and shushed and on the point it's not done well.  What I am saying is that the departments will naturally normalize, and they will almost certainly stay expanding again in the future as the cycle restarts.  I have absolute faith that our government employees will rise up, step into opportunity, and, ultimately, see to it that their business gets the people to get it done.",I-think-i-wanna-quit,2025-04-22T21:33:58,1
"This   While not food dyes, artificial vs natural flavorings are another example of this.   Natural flavorings are not required to list their chemical composition, which can actually make it harder for those who have sensitivities to avoid them.   As with everything we need to use a scalpel not a hatchet.  Some artificial dyes are very common allergens or might cause harm, but certainly not all of them.   * As an aside my son we are pretty sure has ARFID.  I don't love the idea of his safe foods potentially changing.  When Kraft stopped producing their whole wheat Mac and cheese it took us months to get him to switch to regular Kraft.   Heck, plum organics mighty 4 pouches changed their packaging (not even the content inside) and that took multiple months for him to get that back as a safe food.   Even if some artificial dyes may not be the best I would much rather my son have them than not eat.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-22T04:18:04,7
"Since you didn't ever actually look up anything to reply, the answer I was looking for is 9. Nine is the number of colorings this would actually affect, because they're currently allowed. No-one will ever go through the process of getting a synthetic dye approved again, so it would only ever be that nine.  One of those was never approved for human consumption - it's an orange you can only use for coloring the skins of citrus that won't be eaten, ie dying actual oranges more orange. Another is a red that is only approved for hot dog casings.  Of the 7 remaining, there's some evidence of harm from 6. If you started the approval process now, none of those would be approved. Brilliant blue seems OK.  This isn't a big loss.",Banes_Addiction,2025-04-22T17:47:07,2

Cochineal itself does not increase risk of cancer, or other serious health concerns, although some people may be allergic to it.

"What I am saying is that big companies get bigger.  Every department puts together a case for more people, some get approved, and they get hired.  Then they do it again.  Often, the centralized people either are not qualified to know or just let it creep.  Organization bloat is a huge issue - it leads to low productivity, low accountability, and, for practically every decent sized company, it is fixed through periodic rounds of layoffs (unless they are quick to fire which is another issue).  I would have reduced headcount very differently, but, just because 20% of reviewers are let go, it doesn't mean they stop reviewing.  It means they find a way to get better.  Look at the oil and gas industry - the US used to produce a ton less oil with a workforce that was at least 30% larger.
