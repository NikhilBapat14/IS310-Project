[Pope Leo XIV’s background](https://collegeofcardinalsreport.com/cardinals/robert-francis-prevost/)  Seems he is of similar mind to the late Pope Francis in many regards.,Achmetan,2025-05-08T13:36:39,168
"This is both surprising and not surprising. Not surprising in that he is considered fairly aligned with Francis' views and spent considerable time working in Latin America where Francis is from (albeit in Peru). Surprising in that his name was never even in the list of frontrunners on most media sites, and the idea of picking a Pope from the US (a superpower where the faith is struggling) as opposed to the third world (where the faith is surging and there's less suspicion of geopolitical influence) was previously seemingly not in the table.",Briguy28,2025-05-08T12:52:20,154

"Overheard conversation in the gym about the new Pope:   I like the first name ""Leo"", but that last name he chose for himself is kinda difficult to pronounce. The ""Xi"" may be pronounced ""Chee"" (similar to the name of the president of China), so the actual pronunciation of the Pope's new surname probably sounds like ""Cheeve"". So his new name is Leo Cheeve",wakeupagainman,2025-05-09T10:59:25,2
"I know some folks are concerned, but I’m hopeful this new Pope turns out to be a good one. Most of the Cardinals could probably be described as social justice-minded as they tend to prioritize care for the poor. But that doesn’t mean they automatically must endorse bad social policies like open-borders.  If this Pope does lean progressive, I hope it’s in how the Church engages with modern society. Mass needs to feel more relevant to today’s world. Embracing technology, updating the way the Church communicates, and connecting more with younger generations would be welcomed progress.",PTS21,2025-05-08T15:26:53,6

"I’m not Catholic and I don’t really follow the politics of the church, but wouldn’t it arguably make sense for them to attempt to reinvigorate the faith in the US where it’s been struggling? I don’t really understand why an American pope would be viewed as suspicious, especially considering that there’s never even been one before.",nukalurk,2025-05-08T13:34:45,64
He’s also a Peruvian citizen as of somewhat recently. Made cardinal only a couple months ago. I wonder if he was planning for this and was quietly being positioned by Francis as a successor.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T13:19:31,34

"One caveat… Los Angeles will absolutely screw up the Olympics. They can’t clear a square mile of debris or clear brush that everyone else does routinely. They can’t build housing. You can’t take a leak without filing an environmental impact study and settling with a govt funded leftist NGO there that sued you when you tried. It will be an amazing spectacle into the incompetence and corruption by patronage of the progressive left. They can’t build things, they only retain the ability to scold, to tax, and to distribute winnings to the political class, NGOs, and govt labor unions.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T13:16:54,87

"As a Catholic I know very little about him but there have been clues, some good and some bad.  My biggest concerns, from a Catholic standpoint, are that both Cardinal Cupich and James Martin support him. Martin, for those unfamiliar, is all about pushing an alphabet mafia agenda. The good is that as a dual citizen of Peru, he may lean a little more towards the conservative side as Peruvians are some of the most socially conservative people in Latin America.",ChewieWookie,2025-05-08T13:12:37,53
"More aligned with Pope Francis. Leo XIII was a social reformer, so him picking Leo XIV is significant. He did come out in a more traditional dress than Pope Francis did and his address was more traditional, so I’m quietly hopefully that this Pope won’t be such an activist.",charmingcharles2896,2025-05-08T13:15:51,43

"Well, bearing in mind that the logic behind everything I said just got thrown out the window: the geopolitical reasons for not having an American Pope go back to the Cold War, and are similar to why there's never been, say, an American Secretary General of the UN. Clearly, as we move towards a more multipolar world, that's less of an issue.  As far as the faith aspect, as the Church grows in other parts of the world, those parts are naturally going to want to be more ""seen"" and have a feeling of representation. This is part of why Francis was chosen. Also, more followers theoretically means more priests meaning more bishops and theoretically more options for cardinals. A lot of people online seemed to think that the next Pope would be from Africa or Asia for this reason.",Briguy28,2025-05-08T14:03:46,20

The first, according to sources close to the process, is Cardinal Christophe Pierre, apostolic nuncio to the U.S.  The second, reported in Italian and Spanish-language media, is Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga, the 82-old-year Honduran cardinal who is widely credited with helping to see Francis elected in 2013, and who is also regarded as responsible for the meteoric 2014 rise of Cardinal Blase Cupich to become Archbishop of Chicago, and later a key member of the Vatican’s Dicastery for Bishops.""

Yes.  And learn how to separate that from his actual conduct in his offices within the church.  Is he going to be JP2  Pt 2?   No.   Is he going to be Francis the Menace?  Also No.  Should the Church have gone far more conservative than this middle of the road milktoast?  Sure.     Was it going to happen with a voting Consistory that's about 80% appointed by Francis?   Definitely not.     This is about as plausible a starting point for a bridge *back* to Conservative Catholicism as you were likely to get.  Just be thankful we're not experiencing a Tagle papacy.,ErieHog,2025-05-08T19:45:22,-2
"Been a bit, but was riding taxis and uber's around chicago when the new mayor got in and none had a single nice thing to say, and if you think even one of them was just some white dude, gotta a surprise for you dude.  Like i said, the regular folk in chicago, the ones not making dev job money or going to starbucks every morning aren't fully in the same mindset as the leadership and the ones getting on TV constantly.   They a bit more progressive than say someone from southern indiana? Sure, but they're not for a lot of the bullshit that gets passed  there. Hell, there's legislature on the floor right now for a chunk of south-eastern illinois to secede from the state to indiana cause they're tired of chicago basically setting the laws for the whole state.  It's not gonna happen of course, cause both chicago will say no and the federal government will say no, but for different reasons.   Illinois gov will say no cause it gives more to a not-liberal state (that they don't like at all) and fed will say no cause it reshapes the maps.",Beefmytaco,2025-05-08T19:28:22,2
