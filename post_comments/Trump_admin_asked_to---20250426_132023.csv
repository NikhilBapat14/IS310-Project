The Trump admin is going to make no one want to come to America for the World Cup,TLakes,2025-04-26T13:21:44,78
American and soccer lover here - they should move it to another country that is a functional democracy,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-04-26T13:51:41,22
They can’t seriously let the US host the World Cup still?? That is putting so many people at huge risk.,SherbertExtension539,2025-04-26T13:28:37,16
We block all the foreigners and USA wins gold!,PlatinumKanikas,2025-04-26T13:37:58,3
"Even if they do ease up, what's to stop him from abruptly changing his mind once people are here? Damage is done, son",ZombiePartyBoyLives,2025-04-26T16:05:30,4
American expat here. Under no circumstance do I want to even visit the state with trump and his liquor cabinet in charge. Sad times. Sad times indeed…..,DoctorDirectorPiaaaw,2025-04-26T14:18:28,4
Nah. Seattle is a primary beneficiary of the World Cup. He hates the city.,TSAOutreachTeam,2025-04-26T13:54:51,2
"His thought is: if we detain all of the foreign players, the US will win by default! Surely only winners are allowed in Trump’s kingdom.",edge61957,2025-04-26T16:32:17,2
The difficulty is even if they claim to have changed a lot of tourists won’t take the risk especially as they can travel to Canada or Mexico.  I hope FIFA makes the games 2 countries so all fans who don’t want to travel to the US have the chance to see their team in group Stage,Maleficent_Pay_4154,2025-04-26T16:54:02,2
"""Please, sir, suspend your fascist deportation program for the World Cup, sir. Please think of the capitalists, sir!""",cjwidd,2025-04-26T18:01:46,2
If I am a soccer player in the World Cup I won’t travel to USA. What if I get deported to El Gulag?,trashmenowokay,2025-04-26T16:21:05,2
Have the teams even said thank you yet ?,feckingcarnage,2025-04-26T14:57:43,1
You have to be out of your mind to come to the World Cup especially if you’re a minority. Why risk landing in a detention center just so you can watch a game?,hmr0987,2025-04-27T18:28:16,1
 World Cup is going to happen...Way too much money to be made...FIFA nor the Olympics committees have a moral compass ...these are people who are indifferent to other human beings...long as they keep their power to extract bribes and kick backs.  I mean...Jesse Owens went to the Olympics in the late 30's...just saying....I'm sure he was rightfully nervous as hell.,goderdammurang,2025-04-28T01:48:06,1
Two corrupt groups coming together. FIFA might as well be the mafia.  Hope it is an embarrassing failure for both parties.,IRideMoreThanYou,2025-04-26T13:24:20,47
>The Trump admin is going to make no one want to come to America for the World Cup  Or the Olympics.  Or come to America. Period.,xMagnis,2025-04-26T14:49:06,15
Oh Canada. Excellent alternative.,TieVast8104,2025-04-26T14:18:12,2
The last cup was literally built with slave labor and the one before that was in Russia. I think we are fine,Lantis28,2025-04-26T13:24:57,1
"The World Cup is just a honey pot to get free slave labor. Considering so many stadiums ware build with slave labor, it’s come full circle.",NapOwl,2025-04-26T14:42:57,3
"People went to Quatar, they will come to the US",8bitmorals,2025-04-26T13:38:51,0
Good cheap tickets then ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-26T14:56:03,-4
Laughs in Qatari.,StephenSwolebear,2025-04-26T14:01:37,20
The last two were in Qatar and Russia,Lantis28,2025-04-26T14:10:30,17
Yeah somehow I don’t think Qatar or Russia are any better.,AgileFlea77,2025-04-26T15:21:14,3
"To be fair, why start now?",TSAOutreachTeam,2025-04-26T13:55:18,5
"It’s being hosted by Canada, Mexico and the US. First time in history it’s being hosted by 3 countries",ShyHuhLewd,2025-04-26T19:30:28,1
Every team that beats the US team is sent to El Salvador for taking advantage of the US.,QuantumWire,2025-04-26T13:39:00,13
"Well actually they kind of have since fifa expanded the World Cup roster. It’s kind of hard for 1 country to do it all. The USA World Cup is North American with Canada, USA and Mexico co hosting. ",Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-26T14:58:17,1
Only first string -- no need to clog up the system with whole teams. ,thisoneismineallmine,2025-04-26T14:17:25,5
Good cheaper tickets then for both events. No really fifa tickets are expensive as hell. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-26T14:56:40,-11
"As insanely horrible as that is, they weren't deporting folks randomly to countries they've never been/lived.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-26T13:38:23,12
"Yeah, we're super fine. Tough really to even overstate how fine we are. We'll probably be even finer by then.",specqq,2025-04-26T13:29:47,10
"Yeah, I'm sure FIFA already has ways to making Trump change things for the world cup. No way are they going to give up all that money.",Kevin-W,2025-04-26T14:22:01,1
I know many who have always travelled who didn’t travel to Qatar,Maleficent_Pay_4154,2025-04-26T16:55:26,3
yeah but the point is that border guards and policy are denying entry to any one not white or male. Or if you are white and male and had an anti-trump meme on your phone.,noobditt,2025-04-27T01:55:29,2
That's the upside :),TLakes,2025-04-26T14:57:01,2
Ha! Point taken - let the games begin we're in great company,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-04-26T14:11:52,4
They weren’t disappearing people and locking up tourists for funsies,blackfeltfedora,2025-04-26T18:13:37,-2
An ironic take. I hear the free seats given to US citizens deported to El Salvador are as awful as hell.,xMagnis,2025-04-26T15:01:57,3
You can’t change it at this point anyway. It’s too soon till the cup to have the infrastructure ready for someone else to host,Lantis28,2025-04-26T14:34:34,1
"Russia disappears people all the time, it's just not as shocking or surprising because it is Russia.",namastayhom33,2025-04-26T18:24:00,4
Qatar had documented slaves building their stadium,Lantis28,2025-04-26T18:22:38,3
