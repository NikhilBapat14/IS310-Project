"Can you imagine the lunacy required to think sending such a letter was appropriate??? I mean, you‚Äôre a sovereign nation, you‚Äôre minding your own business running YOUR country without letting foreigners interfere (you know, like the MAGA loons insist is happening with undocumented immigrants)‚Ä¶ Fine, you get a letter from a US president.. and it‚Äôs a country you‚Äôve cooperated with in the past‚Ä¶ and you read the letter and it‚Äôs ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù you stop well established and successful govt and corporate initiatives that you‚Äôve shown have positive economic and social results‚Ä¶ as a US citizen this is just so deeply mortifying",stepheme,2025-05-08T19:30:53,18

Trump wants to stick his finger into everyone‚Äôs buttholes so he can be seen as a giant in politics bigger than just for the US.  He learned from the Kardashians any constant and daily media exposure is good business!¬†,Cleanbriefs,2025-05-08T16:33:00,3
