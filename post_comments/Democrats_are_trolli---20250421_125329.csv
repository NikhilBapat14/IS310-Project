"I know you mean well and this is just a matter of difference in opinion regarding messaging, but haven‚Äôt we proven that reasonable refutations and appeals to truth don‚Äôt work against these people? They don‚Äôt work to win the general voting public over when faced with this kind of behavior. We learned this almost ten years ago when Clinton lost, and we learned this again last year when Harris lost. It only barely worked for Biden because  the American people had insanity fatigue by the end of Trump‚Äôs first presidency and apparently they forgot about it real quick.   It would be really nice if the modern American voting public was collectively a cohort of reasonable people guided by facts and policy, but they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre children in a school yard watching the bullies pick on the studious kids. And if you were ever bullied, you might know that you don‚Äôt respond to ‚ÄúHaha, you‚Äôre a nerd!‚Äù with ‚ÄúNuh-uh!‚Äù because it puts you on the defensive and victimizes you in the eyes of bystanders. You respond to that shit with ‚ÄúYeah? Well your mom‚Äôs a fat drunk.‚Äù",pegg2,2025-04-21T13:34:13,8
"We haven't proven much of anything, tbh. Republicans engage in so much scatter shot that it's almost impossible to keep up. I can't tell what works and what doesn't anymore. I would have thought Trump trying to stage a coup would have kept him under a million votes but the facts of that message got buried under a lot of lies.  The problem is ultinately that republicans control the media, so they can tell these lies for free. I don't know what the play is in letting them run loose unchecked but this is far from the first example. We have certianly not proven that calling it out isn't effective because we have not called it out consistently. But I don't even know if we can as it seems like it costs us ten thousand dollars in campaign money to push against every lie they get to say for free..",normalice0,2025-04-21T13:40:42,2
