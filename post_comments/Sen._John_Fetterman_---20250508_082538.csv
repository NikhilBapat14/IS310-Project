">Before long, Fetterman began repeating himself, shouting and questioning why “everybody is mad at me,” “why does everyone hate me, what did I ever do” and slamming his hands on a desk, according to one person who was briefed on what occurred.   ...   Fetterman’s one-time chief of staff Adam Jentleson told a neuropsychiatrist who had treated Fetterman for depression that the senator appeared to be off his recovery plan and was exhibiting alarming behavior, including a tendency toward “long, rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues.”  That's very disturbing behavior for a US Senator. I really wish the US was set up for recall elections on positions like Senator, because this is definitely a situation that would call for it.",Orzorn,2025-05-08T08:35:51,25
"He should have stepped down when he was missing votes like crazy, he should have stepped down when his mental condition came to light and it was clear he wasn't mentally fit to serve in government, now he's blown past all the warning signs and is behaving in a way just absolutely embarrassing to his state and party. He needs to step down.",N0b0me,2025-05-08T14:05:02,3

"Yea and it’s a smear story too about a guy who’s had some mental issues in the past so everything he does gets magnified. Meanwhile, you have senators screaming at their constituents and throwing them out of town halls.   Jesus, you Trumpers will grasp at anything while you worship a human dumpster fire.",alk_adio_ost,2025-05-08T08:51:12,-13
"> Yea and it’s a smear story too about a guy who’s had some mental issues in the past so everything he does gets magnified.   I wonder if it has anything to do with those mental issues having the potential to affect his job holding one of the most powerful positions in the world, especially since people close to him have spoken out for signs doctors had told them to watch for.  > Jesus, you Trumpers will grasp at anything while you worship a human dumpster fire.  You should really consider if you’re adopting a cult-like mindset if you can’t imagine a Democrat being critical of Fetterman.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-08T08:55:54,10
