They are like Trump. Insecure and won't admit when they've made a massive mistake. Trump and Hegseth could be responsible for an Intel leak that kills dozens of Americans and half of maga would blame Biden.,Crazy-Nights,2025-04-23T08:03:03,139

"For the MAGA crowd, incompetence is a virtue not a vice. Holding their leaders accountable for gross incompetence is simply not an option.

The ""Lock Her Up"" spokes people, like Trump and even Hegseth, who said that Hillary put lives in danger and our country in danger, never really cared, they were just manipulating the trump voters.  It is undeniable now that we know that trump kept classified information next to a toilet with foreign nationals right outside the door, and Hegseth sending classified info to random people, with no repercussions, that they, themselves called crimes and for people to be locked up, and no trumper caring.
