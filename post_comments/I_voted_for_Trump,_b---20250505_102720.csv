"> I voted for him, but I’m very worried now. Trump is ruining our economy. He's too irrational and radical in his actions for anyone with a brain to ignore.   This was fucking obvious in 2020, let alone 2024.  All of these people are morons. They are applauding tariffs and hoping he'll open trade up. They want a man who doodled a hurricane path on a map and lies constantly about every little thing to pay attention to reality. They think he's ""finally doing something"" ... though they obviously have no idea what or why. They're applauding him for border security, despite the biggest drop in crossings happening under Biden. They're happy about him tackling debt, despite him adding more to the US national debt than any president, and planning to add even more.   It's astonishing watching these people try to explain their thinking. All they can do is waffle incoherently, contradict themselves, and lie - anything to avoid admitting they did something fucking idiotic in November.",DaveChild,2025-05-05T11:28:37,6

Creating chaos**    * But what Trump has accomplished the most is sowing chaos. I expect us to go into a recession due to his practices with tariffs. What I hope he’ll do next?

It is him and him alone who is crashing our economy.  * **We're feeling short-term pain for needed long-term gains**    * We have to cut spending.

I’m so sorry you were too stupid to understand what Trump was saying he’d do right to your face. I guess you were in a fog. But that’s ok! Welcome to reality where everything is fine now and you will be so respected for coming to terms with how stupid you were. ❤️,orcinyadders,2025-05-05T11:20:16,3

"That first sentence is quite the succinct explanation as to why everyone else feels like Republicans are a) uneducated/not intelligent and b) that they can't be trusted to make well thought out decisions for who their vote goes to.  ""I voted for Trump, but I can't bring myself to support **anything he's done...**""  1. We had Trump as the President once already and the entire world saw how rapidly he is capable of lying and fucking everything up. Stating, **now**, during Trump's *second term* that ""I can't support anything he's done"" REALLY shows people that they have no idea what they're doing and are VERY easy to trick and convince ""It'll be different this time, I swear!"" after having been abused once by the same guy. Remember ""He isn't hurting the right people""? Yeah, that implies Trump **hurt his** ***own supporters*** **and that the supporters did not find it to be problematic since;** they voted for him 2 *more* times, likely including the author of this article.  2. Trump supporters were THRILLED at the idea of the tariff's until they actually happened. There was a QUICK turnaround by a LOT of his supporters on their feelings about the tariffs. Hell, there was even some rich guy who lost something incredible like $7,000,000 in a week or so because of the tariffs and he was all ""boo fucking hoo, no one told me how tariffs work, I thought this was mega success victory fun time starring Donald Trump"". ***How can these people ever expect to be taken seriously*** when *this* is how they respond to something they ""care so much about"" yet know nothing about. How can these people expect others to actually intend to ***listen*** to a single thing they have to say when all they do is make shit up all the time and let contradictions fly like crazy?  Bro we ALL told them a) what will happen (and is literally now happening) with the tariffs, b) exactly what to expect for ALL of his goals that he wants to accomplish whilst being President a second time, and they alllllllll told us ""that's bullshit, you drank the koolaid, you're a conspiracy theorist nut, you don't know how any of these things work"" and on and on and on and on and on and on....  Yet, turns out it was all projection yet again just like with everything else that useless party has as its platform methods and ideals.   They cannot seem to figure out why everyone else thinks that these clowns are literally throwing away their vote, and are thus causing a lot of damage to the US. ridiculously they start to bitch and moan about all the things we told them would happen, that are happening, that will continue to happen and they act so surprised every single time.  Democrats: ""So Trump is going to fuck you over and here's the list of how he will be doing this""  Republicans: ""BRO.....NO ONE saw this coming, but.....Trump actually did make some bad decisions for the nation....seriously, why the hell did no one tell us?""  \^said the morons who LOVE claiming to be mega-super-duper-leet-smart. So smart that they couldn't be bothered to even read up (for 5 seconds) on how tariffs actually operate.",TheNewTonyBennett,2025-05-05T13:59:53,1
