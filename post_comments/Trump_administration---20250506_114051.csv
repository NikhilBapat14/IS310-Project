"Every single day this administration wakes up and says ""hmmm....who can we hurt today?  Which group of American citizens can we torment?  Who's life can we make worse?  Who haven't we fucked with in a little while""    Also...Gen Z maga bros with student loans...where yall at?  it sucks that everyone else has to suffer this, but gen Z maga bros with student loans are getting EXACTLY what they deserve.",StashedandPainless,2025-05-06T11:47:00,47
"Makes sense. If they can‚Äôt afford to make payments on student loans and survive, surely they can survive on less. Their kids can do without those two dolls and no toys. Groceries, although fun to say, are overrated and can just be put off. If their stomachs hurt they can just imagine doing something fun like golfing. A lot of golfing. And more golfing.",istoomycat,2025-05-06T11:48:23,31

"[While I don‚Äôt condone not paying your bills a lot of the defaults come from for-profit schools and a majority are in the South. Maybe these schools should be looked at too.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/most-debt) They are somewhat culpable in this.   I‚Äôd also argue that all of a sudden 5.3 million people bringing less home each month will be another drag on the economy since they won‚Äôt be eating out, buying consumer goods etc.  Perhaps more should be done to create  payment plans and the schools with the worst loan defaults should be cut off from the easy supply of government money.",cedarhat,2025-05-06T12:00:57,4

"Yeah. I‚Äôm literally homeless right now. I dropped out of college during covid when my dorms shut down and I couldn‚Äôt afford it. I have $9,000 in student loans. I‚Äôm currently homeless.   What incentive is there for me to even get a job at this point if as soon as I do the government just takes the money? I would like an apology for the way this shitbag mismanaged Covid first, I remember seeing news of it in November and it took months and months before we started doing anything about it, then fucking not spitting and shitting germs on our neighbors become a political issue because of the current shitbag president.   I‚Äôm so fucked man. I honestly think if things get worse and El Salvador is in my future I‚Äôm just going to kill myself. Better that than disappearing to a place with no oversight or access. It‚Äôs already terrifying to me every time a cop drives past me. I am actively frightened by my government, what the fuck is even the point anymore?  Worst part is I never even got my stimulus check because I was also in and out of homelessness and in the process of literally moving across the country due to getting displaced by Covid. I could really use that $1,000 nowadays.",ChilledParadox,2025-05-06T13:40:01,4

"‚ÄúThe war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous. Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed. In principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or East Asia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.‚Äù",ChooseRecuse,2025-05-06T12:07:07,7

Well the first thing they did was take away income based payments so many of the bills went from $300 a month to over $1000 this is all on purpose.,dom954,2025-05-06T14:17:46,2

"I‚Äôll be fine. I don‚Äôt do anything stupid in real life. I‚Äôm wary of consequences and generally respectful and I‚Äôm just one person so I‚Äôm safe enough. It just sucks right now, I don‚Äôt know what else to say.   Things just feel bleak. My entire life I‚Äôve been witness to unprecedented one time catastrophes over and over, both politically and really personally. But for example, 9/11, the Iraq war and W bush and the patriot act and the 2008 financial crash and the rise of Fox News and the unprecedented effect of short-form content, targeted advertisement, manipulative algorithms of social media, and the reversal of Roe v Wade, and the effects of Citizens United, and the reversal of Chevron deference, and the destruction of the climate, and the rise of corporations in the government, and then not only the general apathy of my generation and those younger, but the literal backslide into these same values that are what‚Äôs destroying and reversing hundreds of years of cultural, political, and societal progress at the hands of morons and those bigoted manipulators that have quite literally turned tens of millions of people in my country into hateful, spiteful, stupid, angry people? I‚Äôm so disappointed, like, what is even the point? I have voted in every election I can. I voted for Bernie the first time I was able to because I actually give a fuck about trying to help people other than myself, but my two choices are between a party that wants to maintain the status quo and satisfy billionaires who concentrate wealth at the top of the pyramid and hoard onto it for soft power that they leverage into control over the government for access to hundreds of millions of personal citizens information to consolidate into large databases that they will comb over with artificial intelligence crafted by a South African Nazi racist and conservative think tank groups like Palantir to create social engineered profiles on every citizen in the country. Any it‚Äôs not even fucking owned by the government, it‚Äôs in the hands of a fucking loon, or at best case a sycophantic, bigoted, power-hungry, wealth hoarding loser. Like what the fuck man. Why did my parents and their parents fucking do this shit? Why are there fucking 80+ year old people still ruling the country when my fucking grandfather died and was essentially senile and incoherent and forgetful and raving at that age? How many 90 year olds do you speak to that you feel like yeah, they should still have the reigns here, they‚Äôre clearly more reasonable and knowledgeable and actionable on current events than me? What is wrong with everyone? I don‚Äôt understand, I feel like I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that it‚Äôs reasonable to have a government that cares about me, with a curtail on corporations pretending to be factual news manipulating tens of millions of people into believing and valuing not only abject falsehoods, but curates truths to force pressure on individual issues to manipulate narratives? Why has Fox News been allowed to do this for *decades*. Why do people only care about hoarding wealth. Most of them don‚Äôt even do anything with it. They‚Äôre still unhappy and clearly feel unfulfilled because it never ends for them. More, more, more. You can‚Äôt satisfy a billionaire, they‚Äôre dragons. There is never enough for them, so why do people want to be *like* them? Like fuck man, how can I as a single person do anything about that? I fucking hate it, I want to change it, but how can I, a single, homeless, famililess loser even do anything about it? Why can‚Äôt we just do better?",ChilledParadox,2025-05-06T19:11:21,3
