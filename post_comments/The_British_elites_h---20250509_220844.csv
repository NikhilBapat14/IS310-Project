"I think there are more effective ways to protest Islam than burning the Quran.  IMHO, the key to an effective refutation of Islam is to focus on the ethics of the so-called Prophet Muhammad. The Quran may be paramount in Islamic jurisprudence, but due to its brevity, it is the Hadith and the Sira that provide the majority of the basis for Islamic law and ethics. And within them, we have clear documentation about what kind of person Muhammad really was....  1. He had sex with a 9 year old child (Aisha) 2. He usurped the wife (Zainab) of his adopted son (Zaid) 3. He ordered the murder of three poets who had ridiculed him in their verse: Ka'b bin Ashraf, Asma bint Marwan (a pregnant woman), and Abu Afek (a 100 year old man). 4. He ordered the execution of all the adult males of the Banu Qurayzah tribe (the existence of pubic hair being the deciding factor), which in modern times, would not only constitute a war crime, but also a form of genocide 5. He ordered the torture and mutilation of ""renegades"" (members of the Ukl tribe)  There are many other examples of Muhammad's moral turpitude. If more people knew about them, we'd have far fewer cases of people defending Islam as a ""religion of peace""....not to mention fewer cases of gullible Westerners converting to Islam because they view it through the prism of an exotic orientalism....something akin to Buddhism.  The bottom line is: Muslims consider Muhammad to be THEE ""model of conduct"" for all humanity and it is precisely this desire to emulate him that is the cause for so much of the religiously-motivated violence and intolerance emanating from the Islamic realm (and from Muslims living in the West).  Once the world understands this, the edifice of respectability around Islam will start to crumble.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-10T09:03:27,1
