"You buy trumps crypto, you get a meeting, you ask for tariff exemptions.  You donate 1 million to trumps inauguration, you get a meeting, you ask for tariff exemptions.  You are a hardworking American with a small business. Trump ignores you, tariffs on imports and/or foreign countries counter-tariffs destroy your business.  The rich get richer through corruption. Everyone else gets fucked.",The_Frostweaver,2025-05-05T03:29:17,7

The ethics of anything orange Mussolini does has long been non existent.  Ethics and Trump do not exist in the same reality.  Going all the way back to his real estate days he was awful. He is a criminal . ,Basic_Ask8109,2025-05-05T07:09:16,2
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbF0EKVduNc&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbF0EKVduNc&t=2s)  Senator Murphy outlines, in 26 minutes, the extend of MAGA corruption in the 1st 100 days.   It's 26 minutes not because he drags on, but because there is a LOT to work through. This is the shit that's getting lost in the news cycle.

"Trump and his administration have no ethics, no morals, and are just generally corrupt.  This is just 1 thing that's questionable out of the increasing number of things.  I don't feel like I need to list these off either, because most people are waking up now.  I just wish people had seen him for what he was before he had ever been elected.  Going forward I hope when a candidate is considered, people do their research of all candidates and choose based on policies and what they have done for America.  Not what they advertise.  Trump was always propaganda and claimed everyone else was.  He even said his way of a guaranteed win was to accuse the other party of being communists.  He used people's anger and mistrust in his favor.  ",arilupe,2025-05-05T05:23:55,1
