"Aren't a large chunk of his voters from rural underdeveloped parts of the US?  FFS The Proud Boys are gonna shit when they can no longer get reliable internet in their trailers.  And I live in the middle of nowhere too, but I'm a fifty mile swim from Thunder Bay Ontario, so if it gets really bad I can build a raft and haul ass over there.  I already don't have cell service.",tinyE1138,2025-05-09T18:26:47,22
"This is something that personally affects me, as I live in a deep dead end little town in rural Louisiana. Under this act AT&T is basically coerced into retaining bare bones DSL lines and an incredibly low end wireless internet.   Without this act incentivizing them to do so, I may not have internet for much longer. Or I may be forced to pay for unstable, extremely low end wireless connections at premium prices.",HongChongDong,2025-05-09T18:01:08,31

"Good god.  I know we all know, but the point of Trump’s presidency is the plain, simple unrefined cruelty.  Any chance he has to screw over some group of people weaker or poorer than he, he takes it.  I’m not religious, but I hope there’s an afterlife when we pass, and I hope he burns in hell for eternity.",Neko_Dash,2025-05-10T02:15:25,3

"My spouse helps to administer this program currently to schools, public libraries and rural areas of the country.  It’s funded by YOUR payment under “Universal Service Fee” on your internet bill.  Funds are captured as a tax collected by a different organization and then sent to Treasury for distribution.",MessMysterious6500,2025-05-10T08:34:09,1

"I’m sure they told Trump all of these people were immigrants. Even though a lot of them are probably Trump voters.  Trump is an idiot. His advisors are capable of getting him to believe almost anything, I’m sure.  The actual idea was probably pushed by Musk (and possibly large donors connected to telecom companies).",Timothy303,2025-05-09T21:45:54,4
"You’re not understanding the point. You’re going to be required to sign up for starlink.  That’s the point. The point is to push people like you into musks service and take away any chance you have of choice.   As with everything trump does, it’s designed to enrich him or his billlionaire donors. ",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-09T18:35:42,55

"It does smell like Musk's fart. No way trump himself had any clue this program even existed, he just signed the EO",baz4k6z,2025-05-09T21:08:40,9
