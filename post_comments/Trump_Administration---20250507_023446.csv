That’s pretty wild honestly. Libya is not exactly a safe place for anyone right now. I don’t really get how that’s supposed to work out better than just processing people here. Just seems like it would make things way more dangerous for everyone involved.,ProudSexyLady,2025-05-07T05:25:52,4
There has better be an emergency injunction to stop this madness. There is no moral separation between the Republican party and the Nazis.,loglighterequipment,2025-05-07T07:51:07,3

There will most likely be a few citizens along for the ride.  We have already started a ride down a slippery slope.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-07T02:54:54,13
"Oh yeah it’s going to be a waste. Let’s assume they are only going to send a single flight, and let’s round down and say it’s only a 13 hour flight one way. Well the C17 which they have been using in deportation flights cost approximately $28,000 per hour to operate. And the round trip would be about 26 hours. Meaning this one way trip alone would cost the American taxpayer $364,000. And it would cost $728,000 for a round trip.  Edit: small math mistake. That’s $364,000 one way. So all together we would be looking at $728,000. Thank you to the user who pointed out the error.",Demonking3343,2025-05-07T03:47:05,3

The point is to torture migrants by sending them to dangerous places. This is exactly what Trump and MAGA want: Violent harassment and inhumane torture of immigrants and non-whites.,Hazer_123,2025-05-07T08:17:06,4
We've already deported people for disagreeing with policy. We are steps away from deportations for hurting his feelings.  Noem tried to claim citizens haven't been detained or deported already which is blatantly false.,longtermattention,2025-05-07T03:41:45,10
"It was Trump's attempted override of the 14th Amendment guaranteeing birthright citizenship that really started the slide. Once the politicians start deciding who gets to be a citizen, we're at the bottom of the slope.",superanth,2025-05-07T07:10:55,3
"Yikes.  And then, of course, there's the lawsuits and court orders - they may well have to send that C17 back to return people to the US.
