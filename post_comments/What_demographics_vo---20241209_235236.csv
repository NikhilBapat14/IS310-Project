"So what we have seen in the post-Obama world is that these coalitions are actually much more fragile than we thought they were and shift significantly between elections, but here were the 2024 coalitions, at least according to exit polls.  For the purpose of this, I will consider a group part of a party coalition if it went for a candidate +5 margin or more (a somewhat arbitrary number) in both 2020 and 2024  This is the Democratic Coalition:  African Americans, jews, the religiously unaffiliated, other religious minorities, urban voters,, unmarried momen, LGBT+ People, People with graduate degrees,  This is the Republican Coalition:  2024: white Christians, white voters without a college degree. veterans, rural voters, married men  (note: there are a smaller number of groups in the Republican core, but the groups are larger, and the GOP did better at gaining votes from people in ""swing demographics.""

"Up front - I do not have a background in poli-sci and this is just my own observations over the past 40 years.  If anyone thinks I'm an idiot I not only will not be offended but will welcome the opportunity to learn something from better minds than mine.  I have been interested in this question for decades now. The big shift in the coalitions that form the two parties occurred [between FDR and Nixon](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/ideologies-flip-Democratic-Republican-parties), but the parties have continued to evolve since then and we seem to be in the middle of another realignment right now as the working class moves from the Democrats over to the Republican camp.    After Nixon, we had the transition between Reagan and Clinton when Clinton (in response to Reagan's landslide) shifted the Democratic party to the right from [Liberal to Neo-Liberal](https://news.ucsb.edu/2024/021387/historian-nelson-lichtenstein-clinton-betrayed-progressives-capitulated-right).  Today the Republicans are following suit in response to Obama's popularity by shifting again, which you can see in the [Gallup polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx), but I'm not sure where too. Democrats OTOH are on their back foot.  They are being reacted to by the general population, but have not yet reached the point of redefining themselves and explaining what they stand for and then selling that to the modern age. What I mostly hear from the political left today is ""of course we are right, we have always been right"" but a lot of the nation has forgotten what that even means.    For me, the coalitions that make up the two parties today fall into four groups:  Fringe groups that don't really have a choice. These groups are actually outliers but each party points to them as representative of what the other part stands for:  Republican | Democrat :--|:-- White nationalists | Communists  Militia groups | Anti-Capitalists (e.g. Antifa)  Less government vs. More government groups represent what has been the core principles of each party, but may be shifting given the past few elections.   Republican | Democrat :--|:-- Rural | Urban  Libertarians | Green Party Small business | Unions  Social issue groups are close to ""single issue"" groups but beyond that try to define their world view as American and any other view as Unamerican or deviant.  Republican | Democrat :--|:-- Christian Family values | Minority rights (e.g. Trans / Atheist groups)  Pro-Life | Pro-Choice Law & Order | Racial Justice / BLM  Single issue groups are endless. I have a much easier time coming up ones that align with the Democratic party than the Republicans, but the largest I can think of are these:  Republican | Democrat :--|:-- Less Regulations | Global Warming  Lower Taxes | Universal basic income etc... | etc...",waremi,2024-12-10T19:06:26,2
"Very good point, white people make up a massive chunk of the electorate so they only have to make marginal gains with other demos, thanks for your response!",almondjuice442,2024-12-13T20:24:50,1
"Thanks so much for a well written and thought-out response! The Clinton point is fascinating, really, yes Reagan and Carter were the first ""Neoliberals"" I feel, but Clinton's ascension and influence in the Democratic party I think plays a huge part in the refusal for the Democrats to move away from Neoliberalism, I had always thought Clinton was a neolib from the start, I did not know he was running on some progressive issues, Republicans have been far better at adapting to political tide shifts IMO, with the southern strategy as their basis, they've modified and modernized their messaging and it's proven effective. Also while the Democrats *could* put together a coalition large enough to win, as we saw in '20, but they've splintered a lot and there's so much infighting, especially with the divide between liberals and leftists as well as their foreign policy. Will def be interesting to watch that develop these next 4 years.",almondjuice442,2024-12-10T22:23:40,1
