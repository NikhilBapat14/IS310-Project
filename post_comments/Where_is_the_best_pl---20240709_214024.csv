Really the ultimate source for a presidental record is their presidential library but for those two they don't have theirs yet as their administrations are too new.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-07-10T11:04:35,1
"I'd try ballotpedia first, though I'm not sure they have that much detail on the record.  After that I'd try an encyclopedia, or wikipedia.  They generally aim to have such things and do a passable job at it.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-11T09:59:57,1
