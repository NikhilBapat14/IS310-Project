"Piss poor security by PA State Police - who endorsed Trump BTW. They knew an intruder was on the property, yet failed to stop him cross the property (not sure they even tried at this point) and getting into the house. Then they managed to allow him to escape.    How much time was he on the property?  How much time elapsed between the arson and PA SP banging on the Governors door with a portion of the home fully aflame? Something is very, very off here.  An investigation of PA State Police command leadership is an absolute must.",bakeacake45,2025-04-13T17:14:43,11
