"I'd almost guarantee they're going to side with the government 5-4. I'd love to be proven wrong by SCOTUS though.   >The key issue before the justices is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government in an effort to hold law enforcement accountable. Martin’s attorneys say Congress clearly allowed for those lawsuits in 1974, after a pair of law enforcement raids on wrong houses made headlines, and blocking them would leave little recourse for families like hers.   Not an expert but maybe second guess your own intel and verify you have the right fucking address.   >FBI Atlanta spokesperson Tony Thomas said in an email the agency can’t comment on pending litigation. But lawyers for the government argued in Martin’s case that courts shouldn’t be “second-guessing” law enforcement decisions.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T14:47:59,8

"> But lawyers for the government argued in Martin’s case that courts shouldn’t be “second-guessing” law enforcement decisions.  Isn't that the whole point of warrants? To establish oversight so that law enforcement can't just barge into someone's house for no reason?  If they're not allowed to be questioned beforehand, then they certainly shouldn't be protected from fallout of those decisions after the fact.",blacksheep998,2025-04-28T16:35:35,9

"""We fucked up and killed your spouse and dog. Our bad.""   That's what they want (although it pretty much happens regularly with local law enforcement). I can't remember the stat exactly but cops kill 20-30 dogs -- a day.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T16:37:07,2
