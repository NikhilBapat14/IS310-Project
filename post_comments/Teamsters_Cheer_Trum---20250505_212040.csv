"Many of the teamster industry positions do not require higher learning or advanced college education. The less educated somebody is, the more they might think Trump and MAGA could be appealing.

">With Paramount Deal in the Balance, Teamsters Meet With FCC Chair Over Job Protections  He has a lot on the line between that and the UPS layoffs.

"It helps kneecap Hollywood, which is advantageous to Christian Dominionists looking to create a far right version of Hollywood. That’s what Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is doing in Texas.

"Very interesting and exactly what I would’ve thought would be the case. Personally, I think the Democrats would do better if they supported tariffs a bit more.
