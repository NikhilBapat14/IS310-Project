"> how do you think the Democrats will respond—and what could they propose as a better plan?  They would probably just point out that if we let the Trump tax cuts expire at the end of the year, then the current top tax bracket would revert to 39.6% anyways, so we should maybe do that and only extend the tax cuts for the middle class rather than creating another tax bracket.",Moccus,2025-05-08T16:49:57,247
The catch is that it’ll never pass.    Just like when he announced $25 insulin but it never passed until Biden did it.    ( Republicans gave credit to Trump anyways),Cyclotrom,2025-05-08T16:23:24,580
"If no action is taken at all, the 39.6% rate bracket kicks in next year for incomes over $546,750. This is all tied to the TCJA temporary rates expiring. https://taxfoundation.org/blog/2026-tax-brackets-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-expires/  So, the big catch is essentially giving breaks to everybody below that and just letting things expire above that - or creating the bracket for publicity and then letting things expire so they end up where they'd be otherwise.",cballowe,2025-05-08T17:05:57,54
"Trump promised a tax cut, he promised to reduce the deficit, he promised to increase spending on law and order, he promised to bring down prices, he promised to not reduce medicaid, medicare, or social security.  It's simply not possible to do all that.  Something had to give eventually.  Of all the promises to break, a tax hike on millionaires is certainly the least damaging politically.

He's just putting noise out there to confuse the talk-space. There are just so so so many things he needs to distract people from.

I do not think he understands basic economic concepts - see: the way he talks about tariffs.

"It's the tax rate that will apply to people who make that much money if Congress fails to renew Trump's tax cuts. So if there's any catch, it's not that he's actually raising taxes, he's just going to let the cuts expire for people at that income level. Which, to be clear, is almost 2 million dollars more than the income level it applied to before the first Trump tax cuts.   It'll piss off Grover Norquest, but otherwise, it's not a significant change.",TheOvy,2025-05-09T02:13:01,2

"The catch is that its showing that they're going to probably cut other parts of spend (social programs)   The whole conversation about doge is quite funny - people ahead of time were complaining that doge cutting spend wouldn't make a dent in the budget becasue its all the non discretionary spend that would cause issues.   So the point of what Trump is trying to do is probably ""rebalance"" the internal taxes so that you get:    \- tighter restrictions on medicare / medicaid / social security (which is the lions share of our tax spend)    \- tax cuts (or rather retaining the current tax cuts) to 99% of americans on the income side   \- tariffs (which will in the short term at least be a broad based consumption tax)    \- millionaire+ tax to cut the legs off of dems who try to say its ""billionaire giveaways""  Realistically the goal is to get our spend back to where it was in 2019 (at least thats what bessent has said) and try and instill growth (incentivize more activity domestically, try and walk down the debt to not cause a recession)",capnwally14,2025-05-08T16:33:51,6

"Whenever you analyze tax policy, remember that before Reagan the top marginal tax rate was over 70%.  Democrats and Republicans both *pretend* to fight over taxes, but the few percentage points they debate over either way is much closer to maintaining the status quo than reversing Reagan's tax cuts.

"Keep in mind, this ""tax hike"" is just reversing what his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did for the rich (at that specific bracket), bringing the rate from 39.6% to 37%, this would set it back to 39.6%.

"My initial reaction is this seems almost like a means to put a squeeze on those in the very low band of being considered wealthy and to subtly stifle their wealth growth, meanwhile the rediculously rich will barely feel it.    3 caveats;       1.Both groups mentioned above will find loopholes to avoid paying it, Trump isn’t about to impose a tax on himself without already having found a loophole to avoid it, but it makes for great sound bites.   2.it will likely never get passed. So goes back to latter part of first point, it all makes for good optics and sound bites to those who read only headlines and nothing else.     3. They’ll purpose this in a bill with a bunch of really devious riders. Then when democrats vote it down (with just enough ‘ney’ GOP votes they can play their little “point, blame and accuse the other ppl of being hypocrites” game of blaming the Democrats for not wanting to “tax the rich like they say they want to” and gaslight the base to ignoring the fact it was voted down because of the riders attached.",jake2617,2025-05-08T20:37:56,1
Giving his supporters just enough reason to think he is pushing back against the rich.

Not only will keep your current 5% lower tax rate but the wealthy will get taxed at a higher rate.   The actual revenue amount is minimal but good luck at trying to use that in the midterms.

"One I can speak about in great detail because my family used it to great extent were the rules around investment property deductions.  Before the 1986 tax reform, a common loophole let investors deduct heavy expenses and depreciation on rental properties—lowering taxable income while also reducing the property’s tax basis. After depreciating the basis down to nearly zero, they’d convert the property to a personal residence and eventually sell it, using generous home-sale exclusions or rollover provisions to avoid paying capital gains tax, even on the depreciation recapture.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and later changes killed this strategy by enforcing depreciation recapture taxes, limiting gain exclusions, and introducing “nonqualified use” rules for former rentals. Today, converting a rental to a personal residence won’t let you dodge taxes on the depreciation or full capital gain like it once did.  Basically you'd have a collection of 10-20 rental properties all generating income that was completely offset by the depreciation deductions. Then once every two years you'd move into one of those properties, and get all of that income out as tax-free cash when your ""personal"" property was sold.",kormer,2025-05-08T17:55:05,7

"> Actually, numbers are hard to come by, because tax information is private and not public. But aggregate IRS income statistics from tax years 2001 to 2021indicate that the top 1% of earners received about 45% of the capital gains, and the top 10% received about 76%. That indicates that capital gains are a major part of the incomes of those taxpayers.   Capital gains are probably a major part of high-earner income but not for that reason. It's basically the ecological fallacy. This data only shows that capital gains income is concentrated among top earners, but not necessarily that capital gains makes up a major portion of top earner's income.",UnfoldedHeart,2025-05-09T18:29:29,1

">the boogeyman character they created of what MAGA is'  The boogeyman is real. Look at what Trump has done recently:  * Threw Ukraine under the bus and constantly spouts Russian talking points. Reagan is spinning in his grave. 63% of Republicans support Ukraine over Russia, BTW. * Ignored the fact that Hegseth included his lawyer and wife in a Signal chat that contained military secrets. This is a federal *felony*. Trump has nothing but contempt for our military. * Launched an unnecessary trade war. Any economist will tell you that tariffs make the entire pie smaller and hurt consumers. The administration had to dig to find an economist (Peter Navarro) insane enough to agree with Trump. Trump re-negotiated a new version of NAFTA with Canada and Mexico in his first term and then immediately violated it at the start of his second term. Why should anyone honor a deal with the US from now on? * Launched a meme coin to enable bribery. Abu Dhabi invested $2 billion into Trump's crypto.  Trump also cancelled an investigation into a crypto scammer who invested $30 million into his shitcoin early on. Trump's sons have also closed sweetheart real estate deals in middle eastern dictatorships which are also thinly described bribes.

"Yeah, it's a *little* off. I ignored progressive tax rates and just assumed for simplicity that all regular income was taxed at 37%.

Rounding up to 5 makes up for some of that simplicity of ignoring the lower brackets.  Let's double-check: A person with $5MM in normal income in 2021 filing single taking just the standard deduction (lol) would owe $1.81MM in income tax. If the remaining $8.7MM of their income is LTCG taxed at 20%, that's another $1.74MM. Add it together, and you get an effective rate of 25.9%. Pretty darn close to the 25.74% from the IRS data.  ETA: If they file MFJ instead of single, the tax on their $5MM of normal income is $1.78MM, for an overall effective rate of 25.69%.

">the self inflicted wounds caused by government spending,  The last balanced budget was under Bill Clinton (D). George Bush 2 exploded the deficit with unfunded tax cuts and a huge increase in Medicare prescription drug spending as a bribe to older voters.  Obama had high spending in large part because he inherited the 2008 crisis (which, to be fair, Clinton helped to create along with the GOP Congress when they got rid of Glass-Steagall).  Trump cut no spending and piled on even more unfunded tax cuts, blowing a record hole in the budget.  Bottom line, both parties have spent us into oblivion, but the GOP is worse because they cut taxes without cutting spending.  DOGE claims to have saved $135B, but much of this was taking credit for programs that had already ended or staff/program cuts that courts later reversed or will cost us more in the long run. For example, gutting the IRS will decrease tax receipts, probably by tens of billions.  Anyone who was serious about cutting the budget has to grapple with the fact that you can't balance the budget without cutting Medicare, Social Security and defense spending. Trump has already asked for increased military spending and has ruled out cuts to Social Security.       I am slightly hopeful about what Trump might do regarding Medicare drug pricing, but I'm not holding my breath. Biden was dipping his toe in a similar approach but seemed to slow-walk it due to political pressure.  However, Trump is also demanding huge unfunded income tax cuts, which could break his previous record for deficit increases. If he tried to offset even half of this amount through tariffs (as he originally suggested), the tariffs would need to be high enough to cause another 2008-style crisis.    >their chicken little sky is falling climate hysteria  Tell me you don't understand science without telling me.
