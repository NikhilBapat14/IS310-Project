He lasted 101 days. Longer than expected.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-01T10:21:16,47
So he’s the fall guy. I had a feeling they wouldn’t go after Hegsdeath. They’re probably still using signal daily.,SunnyCali12,2025-05-01T10:25:26,29

"Trump's last admin had a 94% turnover rate. Then another 43% of the replacements. MAGA thinks this is  what ""disruption"" looks like (to use an over used tech bro term).",williamgman,2025-05-01T10:26:34,10

We didn’t use signal and if we did it was good actually because we did use it and nothing confidential was shared and you’re fired dude.,Several_Vanilla8916,2025-05-01T10:55:27,1

"Love how Trump delayed the news of Mike swapping over to ambassador to the UN so that everyone, like those in this comment section, would react before they even knew what was going on.  Maybe you guys should wait before reacting to the news and coming up with your own reasons as to why it might've happened. 🤣",TestingOneTwo_OneTwo,2025-05-01T14:59:45,1

Can’t wait for him to write a “tell all” book about how awful Trump is and what his 100 days in the administration was “really” like. 🙄,Slimee,2025-05-01T15:41:12,1

Trump wants the least competent in positions of power. It’s by design. You could say it’s all part of the plan to destroy our nation and at this point you may be correct…,hmr0987,2025-05-01T10:51:32,7
"Yeah, Waltz had ties to Cheney and got his start as a neocon. He’s an easy fall guy. The base never trusted him.  They see Hegseth as sort of the new Flynn (true believer type) and they’re still salty Flynn got forced out early on back in 2017.",birdsemenfantasy,2025-05-01T13:20:30,2
Except he’s nominating him for ambassador.,justtots,2025-05-01T19:42:47,1
"They will go after Hegseth - just a matter of time till he makes another huge mess. And if there is even a hint that he's been drinking, Trump will have to dump him. Way too toxic a defence secretary to try to defend for a third time.",CarltonScarf,2025-05-02T03:09:20,1
He was dangerously incompetent and a national security risk so they only allowed him to stay on the job for an additional month...,WidespreadPaneth,2025-05-01T10:26:46,10
"Towards the end it was just a game of musical chairs such as Pompeo from CIA to Department of State to avoid getting any new nominees to go through the Senate confirmation procedure.   Now that his 100 days is over, the legal arguments mounting in the government being liable and in number of cases, we'll see people fired, resigned or reassigned.    The only constant with Trump is that he's inconsistent and impulsive.  I definitely expect to see some level of people leaving the DOJ voluntarily or involuntarily if Judges or Justices start to seek contempt on the lawyers or other Administration leadership (even if Trump will likely pardon them if criminal contempt) or realize they will lose their reputations and bar licenses like Lin Wood, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell, Rudy Guilianni....",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-01T11:28:43,3

"Oh agreed. He will screw something up bad enough they can’t gloss it over. Since he’s willing to sic the military on civilians, though, they prob want to keep him. Seems to be where they’re going.",SunnyCali12,2025-05-02T05:39:53,1
"Look, everything before the “so” in that sentence is something you put on your application letter for this administration.  Nah, this guy was ADVANCED stupid, and not connected enough (which may read as there wasn’t enough blackmail on him) to ensure loyalty.",aradraugfea,2025-05-01T10:55:13,5
I actually expect trump’s doj to start trying to get left wing lawyers disbarred. They’re clearly for retribution and the precedent was already set.,birdsemenfantasy,2025-05-01T13:22:44,2
Welp he's already targeted the ABA so there's that.  And the MAGA GOP in Congress just lets him do it...   https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/trump-attacks-on-aba-threaten-groups-funding-and-membership,Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-01T13:53:55,1
