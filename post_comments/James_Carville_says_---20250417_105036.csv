I just wish they'd make bringing back Edan Alexander part of their agenda. He's been a hostage for 558 days.,GAMGAlways,2025-04-17T11:36:47,44
I support this strategy completely.    I'm just afraid that even the Democrats aren't that blindingly stupid.,Celebril63,2025-04-17T11:15:29,59
Such a strange hill to die on. It will get super awkward if a watch dog finds a Facebook post directly linking Garcia with being a MS13 member.,culman13,2025-04-17T11:08:48,65
"I swear Carville is bi-polar. Every so often he rips the dems a new one, pointing out their lunacy. And then there's the rest of the time when he says utterly braindead shit like this.  It's probably a meds thing.",WPWeasel,2025-04-17T12:38:23,22
"And they will still be baffled in the end. Can hear the ladies of the view now ""What went wrong""?",Wonderful_Ad5651,2025-04-17T11:38:15,29
"Even for Democrats in 2025, this is a stupid hill to die on.  Carville seemed to be showing some awareness of the Democrats' problem right now... I guess I was mistaken.",ConceptJunkie,2025-04-17T14:33:41,5
"Sure, focus your agenda on bringing back an illegal ex-gang member domestic abuser. That’ll sure help your standing among voters",FrostWolf2049,2025-04-17T11:53:57,18
"I thought this was the ""it's the economy, stupid"" guy. Has he just given up on the Democratic Party focusing on working class issues and decided to help go all-in on this insanity because he's too partisan to switch sides?",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T12:07:32,16

So will this guy be who they riot over when the weather gets  warmer?,SkyBridge604,2025-04-17T14:38:23,2
"They fell too deep into this rabbit hole. Backing out now would only show weakness. But continuing with this will make them look more heartless and stupid.   Dumbass liberal lurkers, you want to be weak or stupid and devoid of common sense? You lose either way!",AndForeverNow,2025-04-17T15:52:34,4
Another winning issue for the left. Go gett'em boys!,Right_Independent_71,2025-04-17T11:00:52,3
Eh. Let's encourage them some more to do this. They got  nothing to lose now,Crisgocentipede,2025-04-17T14:34:23,3
With everything happening in the world today THIS is the hill they choose to die on. Then they wonder why they are so unpopular.,philthy069,2025-04-17T13:15:20,4
"As a southerner, Carville should know the story of B’rer Rabbit and the briar patch.",Frescanation,2025-04-17T12:08:32,3
"I honestly don't understand the ""how"" of this. At least without somehow Bukele agreeing to turn him over, which I don't see happening as at the current point in time it would be giving a citizen of El Salvador to a foreign government. Not only that, but a foreign government where you have an agreement with the head of state (Trump) to NOT turn him over.      Whether or not he was properly deported is a different issue entirely. I don't understand how the Dems plan on bringing him back given the current situation. ",Evilsmile,2025-04-17T12:30:58,3
I’m fine with this. It’s a major winning issue for us as the election already proved. I’d rather the media and the Dems waste their time with it. I’m sure the administration has been having a good laugh at them so far.,[deleted],2025-04-17T12:23:09,1

They built statues and rioted for a drug addicted domestic abuser so I mean it tracks,chillthrowaways,2025-04-17T14:33:44,17
Yeah.  Carville didn't used to be this stupid.,ConceptJunkie,2025-04-17T14:35:31,4
"There's no election this year, so the riots won't be funded until next year.  The DNC lost a LOT of money with Kamala, they need to refill their coffers.",JediGeek,2025-04-17T18:23:38,4
