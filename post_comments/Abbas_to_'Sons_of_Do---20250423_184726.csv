"The Trump administration went where previous US presidents refused to go in suggesting a mass deportation from Gaza as perhaps the only realistic solution to the conflict.

"Guaranteed that Hamas’ response will be: “kick rocks, Abbas. We have the guns here, not you, you ineffective weakling.”  They don’t want to give up and leave. That means defeat by the IDF. No way they’ll allow that. They’d rather more people just die instead.",ITrCool,2025-04-23T19:43:09,1
