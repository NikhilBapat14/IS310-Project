">  would that allow more of them to vote their conscience?  In so much as ""voting their conscience"" means voting against how they believe their constituents want them to vote. Giving more opportunity for elected officials to defy their constituents knowing there can no longer be consequences could be good for their personal freedom but would be quite bad for representative governing.",cakeandale,2025-05-04T20:09:40,17

"Prior to Trump, I might have wondered if this could be a benefit. We know (or at least strongly suspect) many GOP Congresspeople are not in favor of some Trump actions, but they don't dare go against him or be primaried.

Congress not getting anything done is how we got in this mess. Weâ€™ve been running a country on an OS that has been out of date since the early 70s,Polyodontus,2025-05-05T12:57:00,2
