"American Jews have always leaned overwhelmingly liberal. Plus I think using the guise of ""fighting antisemitism"" as excuses to mistreat brown people and target universities is particularly upsetting to a lot of Jews, given the real antisemitism is overwhelmingly coming from within MAGA-world.",supes1,2025-04-24T21:59:46,45
Most Jews in the United States lean left. Not an especially surprising finding.,Mikec3756orwell,2025-04-25T06:39:33,5
Trump administration will accuse them of anti-semitism.,blackcain,2025-04-24T22:19:38,13
American Jews are rational people. They know that they are just being used by Trump for his dream of authoritarian government.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-25T05:28:21,7

"Liberal is the correct word, but if you actually follow Jewish communities online they lately complain about antisemitism from both sides of the extreme spectrum meaning leftists and right wingers. Both sides like to act like there's only antisemitism on the other side when both are filled with it, it's just expressed in different ways.",Serious_Journalist14,2025-04-25T12:09:38,3

Hmmm... I must have had another window open at the same time I was reading this thread... it should have been posted in a thread about Trump [threats to cancel funding of the agency that runs Meals on Wheels](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/meals-on-wheels-disabilities-aging-trump-cutbacks.html).,phosdick,2025-04-25T08:01:57,1

"Exactly. But the ones I read about were in the swing states which had unusually voted in strong favor of Trump. There were clear demarcations of counties that were primarily Jewish. It was just one thing I read out of many, and I haven't located my source...",bogglingsnog,2025-04-25T11:30:07,1

"It was more like, the surrounding counties voted more like swing states with a mix of trump and harris, but the jewish-centric counties were largely in favor of trump and stuck out like polka dots on the map.  I wasn't trying to say this is a countrywide phenomenon or anything, just in the swing states analysis I read",bogglingsnog,2025-04-25T13:00:42,0
