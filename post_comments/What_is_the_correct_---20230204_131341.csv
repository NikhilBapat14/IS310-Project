"Officially, all classified information must only be read, modified, and contained in a secure facility, or a secure safe/cabinet explicitly designed for handling classified material. You can hand carry and mail classified info through specific carriers, but once the transit is complete it must be stored back in an approved container.  I’m not sure about senators, but some high ranking officials are able to effectively have a “office at home”, which includes some means of accessing and storing classified information. However, the rules still apply for storing and handling classified info.  The President and Vice President are at a high enough level where they would absolutely have their private home re-modeled to store classified info. What they should have done (and didn’t) is take only the information they needed at the moment, then when they were done return it to the specific container it belongs to. They should have staff responsible for ensuring that all materials in that container are eventually returned to a secure facility.   Unfortunately, this is an issue that plagues the national security ecosystem in general, and given that most senior officials haven’t been indoctrinated like their staff are, lapses in procedures are bound to happen.   Biden and Pence’s staff did the correct thing and immediately reported the classified information to the National Archives and DOJ. Any discovery of improperly handled materials must be reported. Though you may still get in trouble for mishandling the information, hiding the fact that you mishandled it is a far worse situation legally.  My prediction is that, based on their cooperation, the officials that cooperate will be hit with a fine (which is negligible, but proves that this lapse still has consequences).",NonamerMedia,2023-02-05T10:11:41,4
"Normally, you can only view classified information within a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. That information *does not leave the room* except under very very strict procedures, and individuals can't just walk off with the information.  *However,* the ultimate authority on classification is the Executive branch, and the ultimate authority within the Executive branch is obviously the POTUS, which means the POTUS gets to bend and break a lot of the rules in the name of actually governing. This arguably also can extend to people in the immediate orbit of the POTUS, i.e. the VPOTUS or the cabinet (i.e. why Hillary got away with the whole email thing, and why she did it in the first place; all of the prior SecStates and SecDefs did similar things, and from the looks of it all of the cabinet members *post*-Obama have at least had the ability to do the same thing).  >Would he have to go the archives and sign out the docs or am I making it seems too pedestrian?  Only if they had such a process. The POTUS determines the process for ""checking out"" the docs, which includes not checking them out at all, and instead just nabbing them when they feel like it.  The only counter the cabinet has in this kind of process is just not telling the POTUS about the existence of certain classified information, which obviously is a sketchy thought process, but that's just where things are.",r3dl3g,2023-02-05T10:49:57,0
> They should have staff responsible for ensuring that all materials in that container are eventually returned to a secure facility.   I think that might be the biggest failure here.  I don't think it's an accident that it's VPs getting busted while (non-Trump) Presidents with their full archive staff are in compliance.,gsfgf,2023-02-05T11:08:53,2
">Normally, you can only view classified information within a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. That information does not leave the room except under very very strict procedures, and individuals can't just walk off with the information.  That's not quite accurate: https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/scif-skiff-classified-documents-removal-biden-trump-pence/  >Although all classified documents can be viewed in a SCIF, it is not required that documents in the least restrictive classification categories be viewed in those facilities. The facilities are used typically for materials categorized as “top secret/sensitive compartmented information.” > >Classified documents below the top levels typically are stored, retained and viewed in classified spaces that are not SCIFs, said Bradley Moss, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who works on national security cases. These classified spaces do not have the same security guidelines as SCIFs, he said, though they are more restrictive than normal workspaces. > >The only information that must be protected in a SCIF is classified information derived from intelligence sources and methods, said Steven Aftergood, former director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy.  > ... Dietz said, “Of course, Trump and Biden and every other (president and vice president) have taken sensitive information home. “Therefore, it is not true that sensitive information can never leave a SCIF.” > >Deitz said that a president’s or vice president’s home might be considered tantamount to a SCIF",neuronexmachina,2023-02-05T12:59:24,3
