"Absolutely. We cannot forget about these other people. We cannot let this story die, just like Trump thinks it will because of the ramped up news cycle caused by his fucking tweets.",Podwitchers,2025-04-24T19:39:42,337
"He came to the US seeking asylum out of fear for how he was being treated in his home country. And we do this.  This is and will be a source of national shame and I am ashamed to be an American under this regime.  Yeah, proof of life would be great.  And his freedom.  And a national reckoning on what we‚Äôve become.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T19:39:06,175
"I'm glad to see another article about Andry Hern√°ndez Romero, along with this one from earlier: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1k6zocc/we\_know\_donald\_trump\_wants\_the\_story\_to\_die/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1k6zocc/we_know_donald_trump_wants_the_story_to_die/)  He hasn't committed any crimes. He was falsely accused of being a gang member just because of tattoos dedicated to his parents. He was praying and crying for his mother when he was taken into CECOT and having his head shaved.  He's just a nice, innocent person who wasn't hurting anyone, and he was thrown into a concentration camp. Unless any information comes out saying otherwise, I'll assume he's still at CECOT and still hasn't had any contact with the outside world. **That means he doesn't know how many people are fighting for him or when or if he'll ever get out.**  Andry Hern√°ndez Romero's name deserves to be everywhere. Media, politicians, regular people like us... we all need to make sure he's not forgotten about!!  Don't forget about the 200+ others either!!!",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T21:12:46,110

"Yes, we do. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this man. And I‚Äôve been troubled about the way he has somewhat disappeared from the primary discussion. His lawyer had a hearing yesterday that amounted to nothing and the next one isn‚Äôt until late May. That‚Äôs excruciatingly slow for an innocent who is living (assuming he‚Äôs alive, which I am, but since this article is about proof of life it‚Äôs worth mentioning) in such horrible conditions.",Idkfriendsidk,2025-04-24T21:30:41,24

"So, are the evangelicals still cheering this guy? It is monstrous, and so unbelievably the opposite to what Christ taught in the New Testament.   No matter how they feel about the person, treating a human being like this is so obviously evil in every way that it is beyond belief that anyone with any tiny shred of decency, morality, or compassion must be shuddering.   And if they justify it, for any reason, then they are faking their beliefs. Utterly and completely faking them. You cannot cheer this on and honestly believe you are going after death to any kind of reckoning.",Saidhain,2025-04-25T06:59:37,3
"I know, Hegseth wants to set up a makeup studio at the Pentagon!  This artist could work there!",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-24T20:19:58,8
">As NBC News has reported, Hern√°ndez Romero‚Äôs tattoos were inspired by his desire to honor his parents and his love of his town‚Äôs annual Three Kings festival. ‚ÄúHe would design and sew his own costumes, and he would do the makeup for all the women in the parade,‚Äù a childhood friend told NBC, which noted that crown tattoos were a local trend. But two private contractors at Otay Mesa determined that the tattoos marked him as a gang member. That was apparently enough to consign Hern√°ndez Romero indefinitely to a black hole. **(Later, USA Today would reveal that one of the two contractors was Charles Cross Jr., a ‚Äúdisgraced former Milwaukee cop with credibility issues‚Äù who‚Äôd been fired for driving his car into a home while drunk.)**   That's who these brown shirts are. Men with nothing but vicious hate and cruelty in their hearts. God only knows what undiagnosed psychiatric disorders they might have. This Trump Regime has sociopaths and psychopaths joining forces to inflict as much pain on as many as possible.",DevoALMIGHTY,2025-04-25T10:17:00,2

I don't think the Venezuelans are being held at CECOT or at least not in gen pop. They are probably being kept as political prisoners to leverage in negotiations with Maduro.¬†,Frogacuda,2025-04-25T07:41:14,0
"It honestly seems like he's running out of steam when it comes to flooding the zone.

And it‚Äôs sad people still refer to this as just deportation and it‚Äôs so much more than this - it‚Äôs lifelong imprisonment in a hell hole with no due process. So cruel,tincerbell16,2025-04-25T02:02:10,43

"Yeah, we need proof of life for all of them, not to mention a good reason for what they're doing holding them there and for how long they intend to keep them.          Trump sent a bunch of people without criminal records to a prison camp in El Salvador that's touted by Bukele as being a place no one ever leaves from. Even if they're alive and fine they still shouldn't be in a concentration camp just for crossing our border.           It's insane that we have to go beyond that and ask for proof they're not being sent to a death camp.",Oodlydoodley,2025-04-25T00:00:55,5
