Honestly I remember back then there were actual risks to taking illegal drugs. New batch of drugs users are so coddled. With their narcan. Fentanyl is a real danger. But then again you’re taking illegal drugs; what the hell did you think it was safe? ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T13:12:42,-27

They really don't care about abortion bc it ends a life. They care about banning abortion bc they love the fact that someone who didn't want a child or can't take care of child is being punished with one.   Which falls right in line with cutting Narcan funding. They want people to suffer. That is their number one goal above all.

">But then again you’re taking illegal drugs; what the hell did you think it was safe?    You don't seem to understand that the people who get addicted to things like that were either never taught that it was dangerous, or their doctor prescribed it to them, so they thought it was safe.  I think it should be super obvious? So why don't you understand the problem? Yeah, the people who are educated about it, don't normally get addicted to it. Yet, we have a political party that is doing everything in their power to destroy the education system and now they're destroying the system that helped the addicts that wanted to get better, survive their addiction. Now, they're probably just going to die.  So, this is clearly a plan for failure, by a gang of criminals. That's what the republican party is.",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-25T13:17:59,14

"This take doesn't make any sense when we have been living through the worst overdose crisis in the country's history for the last decade, fueled by a toxic street supply of drugs containing fentanyl, xylazine, and other adulterants. It is riskier to do drugs now than it was 30 years ago. Over the last two years we have just started to see this trend reversed, and the saturation of naloxone is perhaps the biggest reason for that. And the program cited in the article specifically funds training for first responders in states like Missouri that have been hit hardest by the overdose crisis, plus resources to help people get into treatment and recovery.",Hghwytohell,2025-04-25T13:24:14,8

This is why so many of us refuse to prescribe any at all any more.  Al they do is lead to dependence and addiction.  There are only really very narrow situations where opioid pain control even warranted and they are never warranted for non cancer chronic pain.
