"This is basically just state run media at this point, no one who opposes Trump or questions him properly is allowed in the White House press conference room. Now all of those Trump voters who said that Project 2025 was ""just a conspiracy"" can see how wrong they were, and you can hear crickets coming from them right now. What is happening right now should come as no surprise to anyone who voted for him. President Trump encouraged and led a seditious conspiracy that culminated in the attack on our nation's capitol on January 6th, 2021.",Long-Tip-5374,2025-04-30T11:50:54,29
"Even if the appointees are competent, the amount of churn will negatively impact effectiveness. It's the worker-bee civil servants who provide the continuity from administration to administration and know how to get things done.",snoo_spoo,2025-04-30T12:45:30,4
Stop giving your powers away already... get a GoFundMe account going...then hire BDO as the forensic accountants to the account...hire attorneys for representation in the courts...call the media and let the fireworks begin...,AK49Logger,2025-04-30T12:54:31,2
"I wish these fucking headlines pointed out that EOs aren't magic and if he writes an unconstitutional one it doesn't immediately come true forever.  Like, I get it, he is ignoring courts too, but the media just sounds like they are accepting that EOs are automatic dictates, and that isn't true.",demystifier,2025-04-30T12:16:51,4

"I truly believe that Trump had no idea about project 2025, I think the dude is just a figurehead at this point, Heritage Foundation paid him money, and hes just like do whatever you want. I mean the man doesn't read, and the project 2025 playbook doesn't have pictures.",Routine-Reaction-592,2025-04-30T11:55:58,5
He just did interviews with Time and ABC.,[deleted],2025-04-30T16:11:55,-1
Exactly and zero faith that he’d appoint competent folks.  They e been firing the competent folks left and right and putting people like RFK Jr and Hegseth into Cabinet positions.  At DoD none of the appointees have any real or meaningful experience in the field (SEC Army was a Lieutenant),Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-30T12:50:36,2
Not crediting his voters. But there are policy wonks and advisors and think tanks that have been strategizing this for years and are pulling the strings behind the scenes,Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-30T12:53:48,2
"It's likely he was approached with the deal of all your litigation against you will go away, you just can't fire any of us and you sign the EO's we put on your desk, you get to go golf and we'll put you in front of cameras every couple of days.",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T14:15:43,5

Wasn’t Heritage also basically doing “trainings” for prospective replacements for the civil servants?,Throb_Zomby,2025-05-03T18:26:32,1
You miss the point.  You claimed that Maga voters will realize project 2025 was a true conspiracy.,mithridateseupator,2025-04-30T16:55:12,1
