"I believe you are confusing the issues when jury selecting. The issue is not: Do you know the defendant (or witnesses)? Rather, the inquiry is: Can you be impartial in your determination and application of the law to the facts.  Certainly, there are people out there who would know the ex-president, but are indifferent or apolitical.",SGP_MikeF,2022-08-15T18:46:42,2
An ex-president is an ordinary citizen and will be tried in front of a jury of his peers. There's nothing special about an ex-president. Nothing changes. A jury will be assembled from a jury pool just like any other trial.,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-15T19:18:41,2
"People really misunderstand this part of jury selection. Folks are not barred from the jury process simply because they have an opinion on things or know about the situation. Complete and total ignorance of anything related to the case is obviously an unreasonable standard for certain cases, and even then, do you REALLY think finding the 12 most living-under-a-rock people automatically results in better outcomes? Jurors that can think and are invested in society are a good thing.  So the standard here isn't ""are you completely oblivious?"" but rather ""can you be impartial as you apply the facts and the law in this case regardless of what you know or suspect about this case?"" There are plenty of folks in the latter category who could serve as a jury.",mormagils,2022-08-16T09:50:21,1
"If it's possible, select a jury who voted independent or didn't vote.",jayzed2000,2022-08-20T22:32:40,1
"I don't believe I'm confusing anything. The fact that EVERYONE knows and has likely formed a bias for or against such a well recognized figure, just by virtue of being an American citizen, tells me that it could likely affect their decision. I don't believe we can just pretend that average people are able to remain impartial for jury selection, when we don't even hold our politicians to this standard.",overzealoushobo,2022-08-15T19:39:34,0
"I understand the process.  But he is far from ordinary.  We can't just pretend that average people are able to remain impartial for jury selection, when we don't even hold our politicians to this standard.",overzealoushobo,2022-08-15T19:36:27,0
"I totally understand how it **should** work, just making the hypothesis that it would be significantly more challenging to find an impartial jury for such a high profile defendant.  And in instances where it is suspected the jury ""has it out"" for the defendant, you can't proceed with that jury.  I don't have any real solutions, I'm just wondering what sort of headlines/defense and arguments we'll inevitably hear if (when?)  this goes to trial.  Interesting and unprecedented times ahead I think.",overzealoushobo,2022-08-16T10:49:16,1
"He is ordinary and nothing special applies to him. No pretending is allowed. This question has no special answer.  When movie stars and athletes go on trial, what special treatment do they get? They are well known. No man is above the law. No man whatsoever.",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-15T19:46:32,2
"Yeah, it's more challenging. Yeah, maybe despite our best efforts we'll get some folks that will not put aside their personal biases as well as we might hope. But if we could successfully prosecute OJ Simpson or Darryl Strawberry or some famous actor or whatever, we can successfully prosecute Trump.  It will be hard. It will be stressful. It will be subject to bad faith attacks from various media sources. But it's not impossible because our system of trial by jury is designed to be able to function even in cases of extreme notoriety.   I can tell you one solution is not giving up. If we refuse to proceed on the assumption that we'll make a mistake then we are just letting certain people be above the law. There is no reason to admit defeat before we've even given it a shot.",mormagils,2022-08-16T10:54:34,2
"I think you may be missing my point.  We are in agreement that he is not special.  He is not above the law.  And this same concern of mine applies to celebrities as well, but to a less polarizing degree.  People may know who Johnny Depp is, but may not have a strong bias.  But due to the polarization of the political parties, I would argue that it will be close to impossible to find a jury immune from bias.  Admittedly, if I were on that jury, I would absolutely struggle with my own biases, as I have strong opinions towards the defendant.",overzealoushobo,2022-08-15T19:52:51,0

"No I understand your point completely. Politics are part of our society and the bed you make as a politician is the bed you sleep in as a citizen, which is why politicians should be careful about what they do.   In other words each career has its pros and cons. Trying to get a fair trial within the society you help to shape is something a politician should be conscious of while in office. They aren't allowed to avoid that.   People are always put on juries with preconceived opinions. We're human... That's how our system and society works. It's up to the jurist to determine if they can put those opinions aside and look at the evidence. In our justice system preconceived opinions always help and hurt people everyday... That's a proven fact. This would be no different.",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-15T20:01:54,2
"Hypothetical/Thought experiment:  There are 12 jurors.  11 of them have absolutely no bias (somehow) for or against the ex president.  1 of the Jurors, however, is a huge supporter of the ex president, and would never vote against him because they are a strong supporter.  This would make all of the evidence, no matter how damning, absolutely worthless.  They have decided their conviction based on their personal feelings, and not the evidence.  The difference between an Ex President, and some dude that allegedly stabbed a guy, is that no one knows the dude that stabbed a guy. Clearly this poses an issue that an Ex President would have, vs some random person no one knows?  I don't know how to better explain this dilemma.  You truly see no difference in a president being on trial, from a random dude off the street?  You think its possible for a jury of 12 people to walk in knowing they are passing judgement on the president to have absolutely NO bias?  If that is not possible, is the evidence and time spent in court pointless?  I am not saying I have a better solution, but this has not happened before.  I don't see how a fair trial is possible.  And I would wager the Ex president would make the same case.",overzealoushobo,2022-08-15T20:13:16,2
"Ok ok. I'll budge and go for the ride with you. ðŸ˜‰...and I slept on it and here's what might work:   The former president was the commander and chief when the crimes were committed. That would make him the civilian leader of the military.  Given that the documents are related to our weaponry, it could be held that they are military crimes. If that were to hold true, he could be tried by a military court martial. It's been upheld that civilians can face a martial if the crimes are against the military. That would eliminate the possibility of a tainted jury and let the entire body of evidence be presented instead of having to keep everything classified due to the sensitivity of the evidence....  Thoughts?",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T06:23:44,1
"Definitely more in line with what the problem presents, for obtaining a solution, yes.  I know I'm not offering any real solutions either.  Mostly just  mulling this over in my head for how this might turn out if there really is to be a trial, and some of the arguments we may hear as a result.  Sorry if I came off  wrong, but thanks for the thoughtful engagement!",overzealoushobo,2022-08-16T10:45:33,2
I really think treating this as a military crime is more suitable given the confidentiality of the items in question...its a long shot....  No don't apologize at all. I owe you the apology - I was trying to be as stern and unyielding just as I hope the law would be in this scenario...no room for special consideration lol. This was thoughtful indeed!,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T11:27:01,1
