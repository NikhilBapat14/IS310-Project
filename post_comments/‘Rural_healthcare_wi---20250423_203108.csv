"Medicaid cuts under consideration by Republicans ‚Äúwill cause the American people to nearly revolt,‚Äù Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday.  Children and older adults will be hit the hardest, as well as those with private insurance, he predicted to Stephanie Ruhle, MSNBC host and a senior business analyst with NBC News, at Semafor‚Äôs World Economy Summit in Washington, DC ‚Äî and ‚Äúrural healthcare will cease to exist.‚Äù  Cutting Medicaid will turn voters against Trump, including his own supporters, Beshear said.  ‚ÄúI tell you what will move people more than anything else, and that‚Äôs the potential Medicaid cuts that could come out of Congress,‚Äù the Democrat said.  ‚ÄúMedicaid covers the people we love the most in this world, our parents and our kids,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFifty percent of all Kentucky kids are covered by Medicaid. Seventy percent of all of our long-term costs are covered by Medicaid. And rural health care will cease to exist if they do major cuts.‚Äù  [Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/23/2025/rural-healthcare-will-cease-to-exist-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-kentucky-gov-andy-beshear-warns?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)",semafornews,2025-04-23T20:31:53,112

"(Sorry in advance for the text wall)  I'm really in two minds on this. I have a lot of respect for people who can maintain empathy for people who hurt them. I think, ideally, that's the most correct way to be. But I also don't think it's necessarily a realistic expectation to have for other people, or a reasonable one.¬†And I also fear that it's (sometimes deliberately) used to create false divisions between people who mostly agree on things, to create an equivalence between someone who tries to do good but fails to display enough empathy when evil happens, with someone who actually tries to do evil things.  I used to agree with you. But having empathy when so much bad shit is happening... is exhausting. It hurts enough to be empathetic to all the people who tried to do the right thing, let alone also those that fucked you over.  And yes, there are also people caught in the crossfire. Progressive people live in conservative places. People just trying to feed their families depend on the success of horrible companies. A violent alcoholic's young children will struggle if he develops liver disease. Even terrorists and the mafia have families who will suffer if they face consequences for their crimes. Unfortunately, that's just how the world works. When consequences happen they almost always also affect someone who didn't deserve it.¬†I think people put the emotions towards the collateral innocents to the side, because that's just what you have to do to protect yourself sometimes and stay sane.  Maybe it's not right. But does it really matter that much if someone who tries to prevent bad things from happening isn't emotionally pure about it when the bad things happen anyway? It's probably not ideal, but I understand it. And I¬†don't think it makes them the same as the people who actually cause harm.",NameAboutPotatoes,2025-04-24T00:47:54,2

I live in a town with 3 coal fired power plants and 2 coal mines. The plants are scheduled to shutdown starting this year, which means the coal mines will also be shutting down. When the plants were built in the 80‚Äôs the town was told that they have a 40-45 year lifespan. Well, we‚Äôre at year 45 and until a few years ago everyone was in denial that the plants and the mines were going to close. Now they‚Äôre panicking because the plants and mines are closing. Many attempts were made over the last 20 years to diversify our economy, but were shot down as ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù because, in their minds, the plants and the mines will be here forever. Our city and county leaders derided one person who was pushing for economic diversity so much that he and his family moved out of town.   With Medicaid being cut and the ‚ÄúCadillac‚Äù health insurance plans that the plant and mines workers have going away, our hospital will probably close.
