"Supplyside liberalism faces an uphill battle becoming part of the Democratic Party’s platform, because it goes against all their political instincts.   When presented with two narratives:  > A) Housing is expensive because corporations have driven up prices  > B) Housing is expensive because little old ladies at town halls want more street parking  the American left will reflexively pick A), and possibly even assume B) is some sort of corporate astroturf propaganda.   You can see this reaction happening all through the comments here. And while some of the people here might be open-minded enough to ask for data/proof that it’s B), most people on the left will instinctively reject it.  But if the problem is actually the little old ladies sabotaging new development, then how do we convince them?  Edit: A / B were the same position",_lizard_wizard,2025-03-24T10:24:57,27
"I work in clean energy primarily because I care about climate change. I believe it is an existential crisis that we need to tackle to avoid significant human suffering.    The past four years were such a missed opportunity for climate action - Biden passed the biggest climate bill in history but then his administration proceeded to slow roll implementation of that law. They tacked on a ton of unnecessary requirements for projects or even made it more difficult to build clean energy projects. This is all despite it being a core goal of his administration.    The reality is that Democrats have forgotten how to tackle big problems and have stopped caring about the end results. I'm not for blindly waving away regulations but if we want people to believe that government can help them then we need to make government more effective and actually achieve the things that we set out to do. Having a more performance based approach for policies isn't libertarianism in sheep's clothing, it's good government and something that the party that stands for government helping people should embrace. ",kstocks,2025-03-23T21:22:14,38
"People vote for certain parties for one of two reasons:  1. Because they have an ideological loyalty (something I understand to be prevalent in the USA) 2. Because they want an improved quality of life, which could include educational, economic or healthcare-related focuses. Ideally this, in a well-researched manner, is the attitude taken by the people in modern democratic elections, yet it is often not the case.  Besides from ideological loyalty, which is hard to combat and more of a cultural issue, there is another cause of why reason 2 (from above) is often not the way democracy works. Particularly, people typically do little research in preparation for voting. One may watch a couple reports done by the major news outlets, or listen to a podcast, but there is usually little research done beyond this superficial level. So what does this mean?  It means that it's easy to deceive. It's easy to get votes for policies that are seem ideal on the surface, when in reality encompassing an ambiguous plan for an ambiguous aim. You see this all the time. Whether it's Trump and Musk's proposal to cut government spending, or Harris' proposal on her ""opportunity economy.""  So overall, in a time where trust in government as well as both effectiveness and efficiency of government is low, it's certainly better if the focus (of all parties) shifts to outcomes. Precision and specificity will improve trust, clarity, and the effectiveness of democracy.   If it can genuinely and clearly (it must actually be so) outline the aim of a policy, with solid backing, then of course it should be taken up. I believe that this is the purpose of supply side progressivism.",the_magus73,2025-03-24T00:11:42,4
"No, it’s just libertarianism in liberal clothes. It’s actually possible to get rid of bad regulations and keep good regulations or fix regulations with problems.   Specifically, the YIMBY ideas that Klein advocates for are heavily influenced by their advocates in SF and NYC, where deregulation would usually result in building “up”; denser development that can benefit from the existing infrastructure of those cities. In most cities the same deregulation would result in building “out”; low-density sprawl that is much less environmentally friendly and more costly for municipalities to maintain, while making it more difficult to build future transit networks.",Polyodontus,2025-03-23T20:41:24,26

"Here’s another example against your theory. More bulletproof regulations and fines were needed instead of the gossamer that was promised.  The Barkley Center in Brooklyn NY was built as part of a deal under the Bloomberg administration. They used eminent domain to remove people from their homes as well as promises of jobs, low income housing, and public parks.  They bypassed the jobs by building prefab units in states with no unions and side stepped the low income housing by redefining the definition of low income - to low income for NYC which includes Wall Street or two people making $50k a year. And they only made efficient single bedrooms which meant low income families couldn’t use them.  20 years later half the milestones have been missed and the ownership of the project has passed hands several times with the new owners factoring in the exorbitant fines for missing deadlines into the deal.  From 2016  https://reason.com/2016/01/12/barclays-center-eminent-domain-fail/  From 2023  https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/12/10/atlantic-yards-at-20-unfinished-and-facing-foreclosure/  “Nine of the planned 15 buildings are complete, but the remainder of the project is in jeopardy. Greenland defaulted on $350 million worth of loans tied to six development sites. Finding builders and lenders for them is complicated by a 2014 agreement requiring 876 more affordable apartments be built by 2025. Missing the deadline — a near certainty — could trigger millions of dollars in penalties.  Current and former elected officials, as well as sources familiar with the project, have long been skeptical that Greenland could complete it, given the financial woes of its parent company in China and the cost of constructing a platform over the rail yard.”",checker280,2025-03-24T06:55:24,5
"I can give an example of this. I lived for many years in a part of Boston, MA where the majority of homes were two and three family homes built on lot sizes of 3000-5000 sf.  I was a tenant in such a house, then a homeowner. That was way back in the 1970s.  These homes were built between 1880-1920. Then zoning came in and you can no longer build such homes unless you’re rebuilding a house that burned down.  Elsewhere in Massachusetts, you have small single family houses on similar small lots. I assure you, no builders are building starter single family houses on 3000sf lots because zoning prohibits it.  However you can buy a 3 bedroom 1 bath single family on a 3000 sf lot built between 1910-1920. It’s asking $800,000. You can also buy a condo in what once was a two family for about the same price in that town.   I’m grateful that I was able to buy a two family when I was young and have a tenant’s income help pay for my mortgage.  In addition to zoning which prohibits the building of multi family homes on small lots, you also have a plethora of rules and armies of lawyers to force homeowners of old homes (especially rental properties) to remove lead paint and asbestos from such homes. After spending tens of thousands on renovations that do not make those multi families more rentable, homeowners are doing gut renovations and selling each apartment as condos. Each time that happens, you lose rentals.  So I know for a fact that zoning and well meaning housing codes are driving up the scarcity and prices of apartments and homes.  Same thing is happening everywhere in NE. I moved to Maine where there are minimum lot sizes of 2 acres! I’m not talking about rural farm areas. ,",baxterstate,2025-03-24T06:56:34,2

"There s no such thing as ""supply side economics"", only a squiggle on a napkin which is refuted by all of human history. In short, evaluating ""supply side"" give you a nothing but failures. Brief history lesson: from 1934 until 1980, the income and wealth of the bottom 90% increased faster than that of the top 10%. Reagan was hoodwinked into his ""supply side tax code"" which reversed that 45 year trend and since 1981, the gap between rich and poor has widened until today it's wider than it was during the gilded age of the Robber Baron.

"I think supply-side economics is a big part of the reason why the economic system that most of the world lives under doesn't lead to optimum (or even positive) outcomes for most people. I see no reason to extend ""supply-side"" thinking to politics - especially since supply-side economic interests have captured a great deal of political power *already*, leading to government doing things for the benefit of economic power-holders rather than ordinary citizens.  My preferred alternative: demand side progressivism. Listen to what the people want (""demand""), then supply it. Efficiency and efficacy of government programs is optimized when you take politicians *out* of the day-to-day administration of those programs, and appoint qualified nonpartisan experts to run them with plenty of funding.

"Housing.   Housing’s exorbitant inflated cost is wholly due to a Byzantine mix of environmental review and zoning laws that give an inordinate amount of power to be used in bad faith by busybody locals. And it’s been the most abused by local progressive and left aligned groups. Or local groups co-opting progressive messaging to halt development when they have ulterior motives like their own land value spiking or “keeping the low income people out.”   There is no way Black rock, investors, immigrants or any of the 80 other minor factors accounts for the inflation of housing and rent. We basically hit an inflection point right after the 07 crash and are almost 20 years behind building homes and appartments compared to demand and population increases. The cities that prioritized a wave of construction through fixing these laws like Minneapolis and Austin are the only counties with stable or dropping housing costs. Austin rent got 20% more affordable the last 3 years.  It’s entirely because these rules make it either extremely expensive to build if not outright impossible. The math on this has been clear.  Local groups are trying to currently get Eucalyptus, an invasive, environmentally destroying, fire hazard death trap as a “heritage tree” to keep a plot in town from building houses in order to “save the forest”. They also oppose the development on grounds of fire safety.",BrainDamage2029,2025-03-23T21:16:19,91
"It’s obviously not a specific and called out peace of any progressive platform, but Democrat led cities and States have curbed the supply of housing over the last 30 years, creating the housing shortage we all suffer from, and blocking the economic opportunity in the parts of the country our economy has geared to shift those opportunities.   Tariffs for sake of creating a big “?” In the federal budget so you can push through a tax cut is obviously a cyclical Republican play to benefit off this situation, but the economy that’s based on tech and finance is obviously pushing jobs to Boston,San Fran, NYC while young people would struggle to live in those places and benefit from the immense wealth those centers provide. Currently the status quo is for abitious young people to plug their nose and live in a small apartment to get started. Not such a problem but when they should start to ramp up and hit their earning (and productive) peaks, there’s not housing conducive to starting families unless you’ve inherited a situation.  The entrenched and already vested constituents are voting down housing measures and suitable and scaled living aren’t being supported the way the free market is proving to efficient in Austin Texas, Houston Texas, Nashville etc.   It’s again not a progressive proagative, but the liberal/neoliberal/politicians from the last 30 years have rendered a system where suing/obstructing development is way too easy. You’d be right to counter that the special interests pushing these suits are hardly Bernie voters, but they’ve certainly been given ample ammunition in courts by people you’d associate with progressive politics (Ralph Nader being kind of a super villain without think ever meaning to) and it’s not a at all unusual to use (cynical) arguments centered around environmental projection to prevent development beneficial to the country but not so beneficial if you own 9 high demand condos.   The democratic solution has traditionally been rent control. The problem is that discourages supply. Developers concerned they don’t recoup investment in high cost areas because their buildings won’t be attractive to buyers unable to rent them out at levels to support the cost of buying them. Worse yet is that the threat of rent control hangs over developers (and discourages them from engaging) while it may not actually ever be instituted.   The other problem there is that rent control is beneficial to people who already inhabit those domiciles or are born residents with and inside track to housing lotteries (that future residents aren’t entering because they haven’t gotten those jobs yet)   That may sound fair. It’s a New York goverment doing something for working New Yorkers after all. That’s also a bitter pill for a 20 year old in Murfreesboro Tennessee to swallow when the country is allowing his home’s manufacturing  industries go to globalization (over the past 30 years that is - again not defending these moronic “we’re the big boys Canada is gonna pay for my friend’s tax cut tariffs) while being told - that’s all part of the plan our tech/proffesional service/financial industries will continue to provide better economic outcomes then those old jobs.

And that's what Jerry Brown did in California, that's what they did in Seattle. But it is still a messy difficult fight.  Edit: If you look at all the innovative solutions - reforms to parking requirements, changes to unnecessary firecodes, upzoning - and they're all happening in the Democratic party.

Klein just did an interview that was straight comedy where he said we need to build faster and when asked how or what specific policies and regulations he would change he couldn’t name a single one.  Just that “it’s good for the government to review but that review shouldn’t take four years.”  Ok, literally no one disagrees with that statement.  The most environmentally and safety concerned progressives would all agree it shouldn’t take four years.  But how is the whole point. It is what makes things hard. This is a liberal version of conservatives saying we need to cut government waste and cut spending.  Great! In a vacuum that sounds awesome. But what specific programs you’re going to cut the spending on and how you are going to do it makes a huge difference.  Ultimately, though he’s not writing the book for us. He’s writing the book for party leaders and hoping to build access and influence.

"While environment laws are overly onerous in regards to real estate, the biggest issue is that zoning is done at the wrong level.  Zoning should not be a local issue. Every single city in the US lacks the resources to adequately rezone their city. We have basically a century of evidence to prove that this model simply doesn’t work.  The literal only way to build housing under our zoning model is to build new housing in unzoned areas at the edge of the city. But urban sprawl is its own issue I won’t go into here.  What we need to do is ditch Euclidean zoning, and push the task up to the state or federal level.    That would significantly reduce the burden of actually rezoning city interiors, and allow the task to be handled by a much larger body with far more accumulated experience.  Maximum nuisance zoning would simplify zoning schemes, and allow much larger areas to be zoned at the same time, while almost always allowing ‘lesser’ nuisances to be built.  Basically, the most restrictive zoning would allow just houses and 1 to 2 story convenience stores. The state or federal office would create model neighborhoods that could be copied throughout the country, allowing for rapid redevelopment.  The next level might allow schools. But unlike the US, whose zoning system would allow schools, and only schools, this model would zone an entire neighborhood so that schools, small office buildings, low-rise apartment buildings, and single family homes could all be built.  And the next level up may add high-rise apartments or office buildings.  The only level where housing is usually restricted is the industrial zone, which usually prevents housing from being built near large manufacturing or shipping zones for safety.  This makes it *dramatically* easier to build houses. But it also makes it much easier to amenities close to houses, discourages sprawl, and allows for redevelopment towards denser forms of housing. All of these things create more walkable neighborhoods with better potential for public transportation.  So yes, we should loosen up federal environmental rules. But we should take housing out of incompetent and understaffed local hands entirely. If *every* major city has failed consistently for a century, this isn’t something the laboratory of democracy can fix. It just isn’t viable to tackle at the local level or through Euclidean zoning.",ManBearScientist,2025-03-24T08:31:45,7

"Here’s a unicorn scenario that runs against your theory that it’s regulations that are preventing cheap housing from being made.   My theory suggests that developers learned the payoff more than makes up the problems with trying to build anything. Instead of butting against a neighborhood’s wishes and losing time it’s easier to just shoot the moon.   In this scenario a well meaning developer planned on building y house “missing middle” housing - designed for low income (less than $30k a year) near great transportation and shopping.   The neighborhood balked at moving in 40 families and kept insisting on redesigns. The firm kept eliminating apartments while raising the numbers until they were left with 8 million dollar homes.   This was for a neighborhood where the average cost was @$500k. The neighborhood is in a very liberal area.

Housing costs being inflated isn’t “wholly” or even a majority because of these causes. It’s because housing is treated as a vehicle for investment instead of a basic human right. All home owners have a vested interest in having their property value go up which then shuts young people out of the market. Zoning laws are a very small part of why housing is expensive.

It's not like zoning laws have changed since the 90s when housing was more affordable?  Current housing costs are a combination of a lot of things. Investors buying 1 in every 5 homes in some cities certainly impacts the cost of housing. Especially when they are making offers 20% over asking in cash.  We also lost a ton of labor during the housing crash. We still only have something like 70% of the housing developers we had pre-2007.  And (probably most importantly) there's also just the basic math of a 30 year mortgage. The median home price in in the early 90s was around $130k with a little above 7% interest rate. When you do the math and factor in the interest and maintenance over 30 years you're looking at selling your house for about $400k just to break even which is almost exactly what the median home price is now.  Combine all that with the fact that wages haven't increased at nearly the same rate and you see how we have an affordability problem without even talking about zoning laws. Sure they probably don't help (and in some cities like SF they are way more of a problem) but they are far from the largest factor in the current home prices.,PM_ME_UR_BRAINSTORMS,2025-03-24T04:25:42,1

"Here’s another example against your theory. More bulletproof regulations and fines were needed instead of the gossamer that was promised.

They bypassed the jobs by building prefab units in states with no unions and side stepped the low income housing by redefining the definition of low income - to low income for NYC which includes Wall Street or two people making $50k a year. And they only made efficient single bedrooms which meant low income families couldn’t use them.   20 years later half the milestones have been missed and the ownership of the project has passed hands several times with the new owners factoring in the exorbitant fines for missing deadlines into the deal.

"No because I'm talking about my real world experience as someone who works in this field. But these are well documented cases - the guidance for the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, the core decarbonization driver, weren't finalized until January 2025. The bill was passed in August 2022. This creates tremendous uncertainty for people building these projects.     Another one - developers are supposed to rely on the guidance for the domestic content bonus credit - a 10% tax credit given if clean energy projects use a certain percentage of domestic content. Developers will reorient their entire supply chains to get this tax credit because its valuable enough that it could give their projects a leg up over competitors. Its core to multiple goals of his - decarbonization, onshoring supply chains, and creating more jobs. That guidance was NEVER finalized under Biden because his team dragged it out, got blowback for adding unworkable requirements, and tried to cater to multiple competing interest groups. I worked on this firsthand, but if you want a source, feel free to look at the [IRS website for the credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/domestic-content-bonus-credit) (while its still around) and note that there are 6 different notices for guidance. That's how much back and forth there was. If you really want sources, look through all the comment letters posted for each piece of guidance posted.  One more for you - look to the Biden administration's decision to investigate tariffs on solar panels from SE Asia in 2022. This literally ground the industry to a halt as suppliers refused to ship overseas until the uncertainty was cleared up. After it finally was because of his executive action, it took 6+ months for panels to show up in the US. This was basically a year of lost decarbonization under a President who ran for president on the most ambitious climate action platform of any major presidential candidate in U.S. history.

Its been over two years, yet very few chargers have actually been built. By the end of 2024, 12 states had installed 44 public charging stations with NEVI funds. 44 chargers in two years? Biden's goal was to deploy 500,000 chargers by 2030. Does this seem like he was going to accomplish that goal?  This is a President that acknowledged climate change is an existential crisis and set a goal to decarbonize the power sector by 2035 (that's 10 years from now).

What I see in my area specifically are skyrocketing house prices with fewer and fewer places to build even a single house. Planned developments now are so small that you probably couldn’t even build the Costco sized parking lot you would need to accompany a car dependent apartment block.   The tricky thing is that building UP is an option, but it’s a *very* expensive one as it usually involves buying tens or hundreds of units of existing housing stock. Then there’s the question of additional load on the surrounding infrastructure or else you’ll have a traffic jam every morning trying to leave the complex.

"By the way, you can look up all the answers yourself as this was a precedent setting project that is almost 25 years old.   The answer to all your questions was just due to scale. This was never supposed to be a single building but an entire neighborhood consisting of 17 buildings and public space.   They managed to bypass all normal regulations simply due to the scale of the project.   They used eminent domain to force people out of million dollar homes and disturb historical sites (underground rail road).   And Union demands did not cause any rise in costs. Instead it was the promise of local jobs that swayed many local opposition but they simply bypassed their promises by building out of state.   Aside from the promises of local jobs and an improved economy there was no market for this project.   This was primarily driven by Bloomberg and his friends. It was billionaires suggesting they know better and then bailing on their promises.   “Because Atlantic Yards is being executed under the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) law, developers have able to   override New York City regulations   for public review and a City Council vote in order to proceed with construction. Because it is a UDC project, no elected official from Brooklyn has ever been allowed to vote on Atlantic Yards.”  “With an estimated budget of $5 billion, Atlantic Yards is the largest single-source development in New York City history.  The project was first announced in December 2003. Since then, it has attracted political support through a number of promises from FCRC and ESDC: returning professional sports to Brooklyn; creating some 10,000 permanent jobs and 15,000 construction jobs; and providing 2,250 units of affordable housing, 8 acres of open space, and a public school, among other public benefits.

"This may be one area where political polarization is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, barriers to changing things. Environmental regulations primarily exist for things that are good but boring (e.g. to build a house, first you must make sure that the soil is not so toxic it will poison the builders and eventual homeowners). Even the most tricky ones for development--like endangered species and other conservation laws--have a good purpose: conserving biodiversity.    When the rubber meets the road, regardless of your political leanings, I think everyone can agree that housing is too expensive, too scarce, and too hard to build for a variety of reasons, including regulation. So, let's try to set aside the labor, materials, and other economic factors and just focus on regs. Progressives come to the table and are ready to bend on preempting certain local zoning, revamping the environmental review process, but won't bend certain conservation issues and still want people to get the right permits. Conservatives come to the table and are on board with preemption and revamping environmental reviews, but they want reviews to end at a set time whether or not they've finished, want to eliminate conservation considerations entirely, and want to rescind any environmental rule that isn't protecting you from imminent danger (e.g. we'll keep the rules that protect against pollution causing near-immediate death, but all of the rules dealing with pollution that significantly increases lifetime cancer risk are woke nonsense. They've gotta go). And then the conversation ends.   Both sides have things they are unreasonable about. The lawsuits you point to that have become famous for stopping development are a decent example, but it's not as if progressive politicians are unwilling to compromise, the problem comes in that neither side is willing to accept the strings attached to any compromise. Even when they do, their voters turn on them and replace them with a lunatic. No matter how you slice it, a big contributor to the fucked housing policies we have is political polarization that rewards politicians who act like school yard bullies and punishes those that try to make compromises in good-faith.",Emergency_Streets,2025-03-24T05:35:08,3

"My claim is that, where housing prices are high, housing supply is low, and zoning restrictions are in effect in residential areas, the removal of zoning restrictions (along with other barriers like setbacks, floor-area ratios, design review, and years-long permitting processes) will result in redevelopment, densification, and housing prices that stabilize (then eventually fall).

"Japanese apartments are small, but they are still cheap, especially considering that housing prices for a megalopolis like Tokyo should be much more comparable to NYC than a much smaller city like Washington D.C.  The average Japanese home is 978 square feet, and again housing prices are roughly $133 per month.  That’s $14 per 100 square feet per year.  Tokyo itself averages about 709 square feet for $466 in rent, which is still only $66 per 100 square feet per year.  In comparison:  * Tokyo, Japan: $66/100SF/YR * Japan (general): $14/100SF/YR * Kansas City, Missouri: $150/100SF/YR * Washington, D.C.: $306/100SF/YR * San Jose, California: $335/100SF/YR * San Diego, California: $338/100SF/YR * Seattle, Washington: $339/100SF/YR * San Francisco, California: $425/100SF/YR * Boston, Massachusetts: $477/100SF/YR * New York, New York: $544/100SF/YR  To sanity check this, I searched for 1 bed 1 bath apartments in a few of these areas.  In NYC, the first listing was 500 square feet for $1,875.  This is $375/100SF/YR (which makes sense, as the above is for all apartments, not just small apartments).  In Kansas City, the first I found was 696 square feet for $1,315 or $188/100SF/YR. A bit higher than my original number.  For Tokyo, I instead searched for 1K/1DK apartments. I did this search in Japanese (東京 アパート), as searches in English would find apartments specializing in foreigners at higher costs. The first I found in Edogawa ward (one of the cheaper areas, but not cheapest, areas) was 150 square feet for $127, or $84/100SF/YR.  I also looked in Toshima ward, the most densely populated ward in Tokyo. The first big apartment I found, by American standards, was a 2031 sq ft apartment for $3,417. Or roughly $168/100SF/YR.  Those are pretty good numbers for a much more densely packed city.  A 2,000 square foot apartment in Queens (similar density to Toshima) can run a lot more than $3,400.    So while yes, apartments in Japan are small (a lot run sub 500 sq ft), there are still many options for less price/sq ft than in the US. And that includes cheap midwestern cities even.

I am certain there are some regulations we can nix that might help, but we also have regulations around earthquake proofing in San Francisco.  That adds time and cost, but if we eliminated those regulations, we could see tens of thousands of people die in the next major earthquake.    So it's pretty important for Klein to specify, is he in favor of eliminating earthquake regulations?  If not, he's keeping time in the process, just as multiple SF Mayors have done, including the current conservative one.  And if so, then he's making a pretty critical value statement that he is ok trading thousands of deaths for more housing.    Also, regulation isn't the only thing causing slow or expensive building.  And he doesn't offer up any actual solutions or recommendations to go faster.  Again, this is no different that Republicans saying ""we need to cut unnecessary government spending"" while not specifying what spending.  Like, yes, most people will be in favor of cutting unnecessary spending, but actually saying specifically what you want to cut and how is a really important component.",Sptsjunkie,2025-03-24T10:08:17,1

You have a location with single-family only zoning on one side of 12th st and multi-family housing on the other. On the north side, you have [2 million dollar houses from the 1950s](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=4348800065) sitting on 9,000 sq ft of land, some of which have been replaced by [4 million dollar mansions](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=4348800075). On the south side, you have a [34 million dollar condo building](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=6162000000) sitting on 20,000 sq ft of land adjacent to a [38 million dollar apartment building](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=8958800030) also on 20,000 sq ft of land.  It's pretty clear to me that, if Bellevue legalized density greater than 4 homes per acre north of 12th St, that area would be profitably redeveloped. It makes a lot of financial sense to replace 2 old houses with 40 condo units. And developers have been building [residential skyscrapers](https://www.udr.com/seattle-apartments/bellevue/brio/) just south of NE 12th St in the past few years.  Auckland, NZ upzoned to their Medium Density Residential Standards, and [builders of houses switched to build row houses](https://www.apricitas.io/p/new-zealands-building-boomand-what) (""[terraced houses](https://www.stuff.co.nz/home-property/360523529/its-terraced-housing-not-we-know-it)"", in their parlance).

I think that this will pull in additional population, as people move to the city (and nearby areas) for employment in the new construction opportunities. I think that increased demand would even out the increased supply, and prices would stabilize for several years before dropping.  Also, I think I'm out of step with public opinion in that I'm totally cool with landlords (as long as housing supply goes up by a lot and people are getting homes). I also think that new housing *should* be expensive. It's new! It has granite countertops! But if people (current residents) are moving in to the new luxury condos, [that means they're moving out of a less desirable older unit which will go back on the market at a lower price,](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/1/3/the-best-evidence-yet-for-the-housing-musical-chairs-theory) reducing the cost of housing for everyone.  The apartment I rented 20 years ago costs 50% more today, after accounting for inflation. That bothers me. It hasn't gotten significantly nicer.

[https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2025/03/24/the-abundance-agenda/](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2025/03/24/the-abundance-agenda/)  Whole article is worth reading even if you don’t agree with the entire thing, but he addresses your point pretty well here about how a lot of people just don’t want this and will potentially follow their own self-interest, even though he doesn’t really care about that argument himself:  **Political Practicality**  *One of the personally amusing aspects of reading Abundance is that it kept reminding me of a two-hour discussion I had with Ezra Klein in 2019 about Medicare for All. In the discussion, Klein is fairly agreeable to the point that moving to a universal public health insurance model would be hugely preferable over the status quo. Indeed, one of the main arguments in favor of such a move is the very abundance-style argument that it would cut out half a trillion annually from pointless health care administrative burdens. Another argument for Medicare for All is that it would reduce health care unit costs, something Abundance actually does discuss, but only in the context of hoping to induce a bidding-down of doctor pay by increasing doctor supply, something that would clearly not be as effective as a public insurer using monopsonistic price-setting power.*  *In our discussion, Klein balked at making Medicare for All the centerpiece of a Democratic health care agenda because he thought it was not politically practical. There is too much opposition of it from too many powerful constituencies on top of the usual status quo bias and general human fears of rapid change. At one point in the discussion, he asks how would I overcome employer opposition to the change, and I responded that we will just have to beat it, which he clearly did not find persuasive.*  *It’s not hard to imagine having the same conversation about Abundance but with the roles reversed. Whatever the merits of their proposals, Klein and Thompson are pushing an agenda that requires direct confrontation with many powerful, entrenched constituencies. The main thing they lament about the administrative burdens of construction is the way in which we have given homeowners — who account for two-thirds of the adult population and are older, richer, and more politically engaged than non-homeowners — effective veto rights over construction in their area, sometimes directly in the public planning process and other times indirectly by empowering them to sue developers. Will these homeowners want to be divested of this power so that transmission lines, railroads, energy plants, and apartment towers can be built right by them?*  *In science, they are upset at the way in which the financing system favors older researchers and institutions and individuals who know how to ply the grantmaking system. Do these people and institutions really want to see their funding redistributed to others? Do the American Medical Association and doctors more generally want to see a huge influx of doctor supply, something that is being pitched explicitly as serving the purpose of bidding down doctor salaries?*  *What about the firms that manage to win a lot of government business because they have figured out how to navigate the administrative burdens that drown so many of their competitors and drive up the cost? What about all of the highly-paid consultants and paperwork jobs generated by the current system? Are these not exactly the same as the medical billers and health insurance claims adjusters that Medicare for All would displace in the name of efficiency? Doesn’t the diminution of their prospects make the whole thing a political non-starter?*  *To be clear, this is not an argument I particularly care about. But it is one Klein purports to care about, at least when attempting to clip the ambitions of the left. Yet Abundance never really grapples with it.*",Sptsjunkie,2025-03-24T10:59:34,2

Idk how a Land Value Tax doesn't make NIMBYism way worse though? I would fight tooth and nail against any development in my neighbor hood if it meant the possibility that the value of my land would go up such that my tax burden would force me out of my home. Especially if I'm renting since that tax will just be passed on to me without the benefit of owning an asset I could theoretically sell to recoup the cost.  Not to mention how you assess the value of land without it being abused just like property taxes or zoning laws.

">This is not a new innovation, this is how governments built most infrastructure for centuries.  You say this, but we can look at the state of affordable housing in America and see that we aren't getting results. We're still by and large letting the market dictate when and where and what kind of housing gets built. And when local governments in cities or municipalities get involved, we often see a kind of brazen combination of money laundering through financial firms and contractors and the government officials themselves. They like to build expensive money pits, and will always opt to do so if you let them.   We have gone through a period of over ten years in America where our private home building capacity has been significantly depressed, despite knowing that the demand for housing must steadily increase with increases in population. We didn't do anything to stimulate and regulate the amount of housing built in those intervening years, then we transitioned into a years long period of near zero interest rates which compounded the problem.   On a broad system level, we're not doing anything right. We're doing right by the leading developers of housing and their financers, and right by the most well off private purchasers of homes.

If you're renting an SFH, then yes you'd likely be forced out of your home as the owner raises rents to capture the benefit of the new amenity. But... they already do that anyway. On the other hand, if you're renting an apartment in a 30-unit building, then the increase in Land Value Tax from nearby improvements is being split 30 ways (and the landlord would already raise your rent to capture the benefit anyway).

Nobody thinks this is a sustainable way to live at a large scale, and the belief that it should expand is profoundly antisocial.

"I said practical and telling large swaths of the population to move isn't practical.   Let's think through an example:  The average income in Rhode Island is 41k/yr.   Most working class people can't just up and leave. Most working class people can't work remote.   Let's take my sister for instance. She makes 41k/yr as a hospital secretary. This is not a position she can remotely. She can't easily up and leave. With her husband I think they make 80k/yr.   The median house price is about 500k in RI.   They have a family of 4.   So far fairly average in terms of household income in RI. Housing is very expensive here and RI is not exactly NYC level density and this problem is very recent. So it's not land being the problem. There's plenty of land available.   In the past decade housing prices skyrocketed, on average it's gone up 7% per year. Population has not increased at that rate, outside of a 3% spike during covid the population growth has largely been flat or growing less than 1%.   Most people can't move to other parts of the country as it's expensive and their homes/family/jobs are local. There's a clear problem with housing prices. So I again ask what is a practical policy that can be done to alleviate this?  Example: The RI Gov. could build housing at scale on state owned land and sell it at cost.  Another Example: The RI Gov. could incentivize home builders by offering more extensive tax incentives and training programs.

"I think you're looking for an overly simplistic answer here.  I think what you fail to recognize is that the ""move demand to supply"" strategy does not need to move EVERYBODY to a cheap housing area. Every person that it moves from an expensive market to a cheap market not only saves that person the cost of the house as they enter the cheap market, it also depresses demand in the high cost area they came from which lowers prices for the people who cannot move. So, the point is not for everybody to move, it's that everybody who DOESN'T move is helped by the people who DO move. The point is just that this can be a major help alongside other solutions by making sure we're getting the most out of the supply that we do have.  To answer your concerns though, as I said in my last comment: ""Policies that focus on making sure people have the knowledge and resources to move to a cheaper market and incentivizing employers to develop in those areas or embrace remote work"". You gave examples of people not having resources or jobs where they can move which is... exactly the policy areas that I previously mentioned to focus on. So I'm not really sure what you're asking here since I already addressed your example.  The reality is ""just build more housing"" is problematic because there are many limitations to the rate at which we can build housing. It's not practical to just expect us to be able to rapidly close the enormous gap in supply and fix the problem. It will take a VERY long time to solve the problem just through building. So, while obviously increasing supply is a part of the solution and everybody knows that and is working on that, it's only part and we can't fully rely on that. We also need policy that acknowledges that it will be a while before that supply is there... like making sure we get the most out of the supply we do have by shuffling people around.",CreativeGPX,2025-03-24T21:00:36,2
