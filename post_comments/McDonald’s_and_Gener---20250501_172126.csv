I hope all the American in name only auto makers get wrecked. IMO they deserve it for running offshore and across the borders decades ago to escape environmental and labor costs. Leopards are gonna need ozempic by the end of this.,ceiffhikare,2025-05-02T05:40:34,1
"I think I read that McDonalds corporate was not involved with that and that it was a local franchise owner who backed that.  What I find hilarious about the whole stunt was that it was to have Trump ""work"" at McDonalds so he could say he worked there longer than Kamala.  But he scooped fries once (after being shown how twice) and handed pre-prepared food bags through the drive through window.  I was about to say he ""worked"" like how a spoiled rich kid being given a do nothing job to give him an employment history for his resume works...but it isn't like that all. It is exactly that.",Probable_Bison,2025-05-01T17:58:54,29

Agreed here.  Blame tariffs all you want but nobody is talking about value.  It costs as much at McDonalds as a sit down restaurant and you get less food.  Crappy and overpriced food is the easiest thing to cut from a budget and they arent the only convenient option in any area.,sarge645329,2025-05-01T19:37:19,1
Did you see how scared he was when he dumped the fries in the oil,Substantial-Dig9995,2025-05-01T19:08:20,10

Yes it is. We drastically cut down eating out over the past two years. doesn't surprise me that many others would rather put the money towards either a decent home cooked meal or better restaurants.,eatsumsketti,2025-05-02T12:52:03,1
Yeah like it might burn his sensitive fingies.  He has definitely never had a callous or a work related cut or burn in his life.,Probable_Bison,2025-05-02T08:13:00,2

"Some of them have submission histories full of hawking resorts or car dealerships, but imagine the damage well-trained chatbot accounts could do over social media during an election.  We saw them try six or seven months ago, and the more we let them scrape and train unchallenged the worse it'll get. Once they rack up a couple of hundred karma over a few months, mods start to assume they're real users... plus they can start operating in age- or karma-gated subs.",4ivE,2025-05-01T18:18:53,2
"It's amazing how much more peaceful it became after the election here, isn't it?  They became fairly easy to spot towards the end. But you're right, they'll only get better.   The biggest thing folks here overlooked imo... is it wasn't just far right-wing/Russian disinformation; the bots were also pushing far left narratives and vitriol.  If a disinterested moderate roamed in here at that time, they'd see mostly hate.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T18:31:17,2
