"As head of the cost-cutting initiative DOGE, Elon Musk is determined to find tens of billions of dollars in savings for the Defense Department and lay off hundreds of thousands of defense employees.  However, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has publicly supported DOGE’s efforts, behind the scenes, he has reportedly opposed Musk’s attempts to cut civilian personnel working in military hospitals, shipyards, munitions factories, and schools.

"musk is working for China and Russia to eviscerate the Department of Defense, it has nothing to do with ""efficiency.""   And the trope that musk is looking to save a few billion is absolutely absurd while he cuts employees from the department that collects revenue, and his political comrades are proposing tax cuts in the trillions.  Agent Krasnov and his Project 2025 comrades are wholesale dismantling the entire US government, and using musk/doge as the scapegoat so 45% of voters don't blame the Republican party itself.",charcoalist,2025-04-22T11:28:25,2
