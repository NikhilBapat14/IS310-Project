"Trump was validly baptized in the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.  So under canon law, he is indeed a Christian.  You don't have to be baptized by a Catholic to count as a Christian under Roman Catholic canon law.  [https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-does-the-church-recognize-protestant-baptism-if-protestantism-has-no-valid-priesthood](https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-does-the-church-recognize-protestant-baptism-if-protestantism-has-no-valid-priesthood)  To be pope, Trump would have to be a bishop, as well as be elected by the College of Cardinals. But the College of Cardinals can also bestow episcopal consecration, because it only takes one consecrator and two co-consecrators.",kaleidist,2025-04-30T10:11:31,1

"To be pope, one has to be **male and baptized catholic**. As you stated, Trump was ***NOT*** baptized in the catholic faith, Trump is thus not eligible to become bishop of Rome (which is the first and foremost requirement) and hence not eligible to be elected as pope.  And whether he was baptized presbyterian, catholic or whatever says absolutely nothing about him being christian. His actions speak louder. And no one, literally no one who takes christianity serious, would look at Trumps actions and deem him a christian. He's an adulterer, a liar, a blasphemer and basically goes against every teaching of Jesus.   Now, there is nothing wrong with not being a christian, but everything wrong with people who pretend to be a christian whilst everything they do goes against christian beliefs.",Quietschedalek,2025-04-30T11:12:17,2
"Nope. You have to be male and baptized catholic. The first one should be already hard enough for Trump to pass, because he's an undeterminable mass of fat hold only in human form by this special blue suit he's wearing. But he most definitely can't pass the second, since he was never baptized as a catholic.",Quietschedalek,2025-04-30T05:03:51,0
