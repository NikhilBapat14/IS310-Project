"It's really concerning that Newsom's podcast featured conservative guests, but seeing Pritzker call for mass protests and mobilization, stressing the Democratic Party needs to ""castigate"" those failing to meet the moment, offers a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, things might improve... because that's what we need right now.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T10:12:40,58
The lane was open for Newsom but some inexplicable unforced errors have really let Pritzker shine. As someone from the Midwest I’d personally really love to see JB make a run for it. Dems need to change the coastal elite narrative. Pritzker is obviously rich but he still seems to have a better finger on the pulse for the folks dems need to win back.,ahdidi413,2025-04-28T10:17:45,29
"Newsome: coward who refuses to stand up for trans people, cozies up to right wing agitators.   Pritzker: unapologetically pro trans rights.   Easy choice, fuck Gavin.",witchgrove,2025-04-28T10:36:11,18
California Democrats must have terrible national strategists. Newsom was in a great position to be leader of the progressive voice and he instead decided to follow Kamala’s path but go even further right. Liz Cheney? No I want to buddy up with Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon! Ignore trans issues? No! I want to throw trans people under the bus and agree with the right wing!,veruca_seether,2025-04-28T11:09:52,9

It's WAY TOO EARLY to pick names. Don't fall for dems. Pritzker is making great observations about the democratic party. Let's keep it going... Not picking a candidate so soon. That's political suicide.,williamgman,2025-04-28T10:34:59,1
"Pritzker may be yet another ultra wealthy candidate, but he has proven he works for his constituents. He isn’t afraid of Trumps bullying tactics, and appears happy to throw down where needed.

There should be 20 Democrats running for President right now. Twenty strong voices sharing their ideas on now we're going to move the county forward. Democrats need to look to the future while learning from the past. These voices will compete with their plans and raise to the top for an open honest primary.  1.Peter Buttigieg  2. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 3 Gavin Newsom 4. JB Pritzker 5. Grethchen Whitmer 6. Cory Booker 7. Josh Shapiro 8. Wes Moore  9. Andy Beshear 10. Mark Cuban  11. Tom Walz 12. Jamie Raskin 13.

"You don't fight oligarchy by putting a billionaire on the top. It blunts your attack much like when Dems nominated Biden over Bernie. That meant we couldn't attack Republicans for crashing the economy via banking de regulation, or wasting trillions on the Iraq war, or making it harder to discharge medical debt in bankruptcy.  Because of course Biden had supported all of that.    How do you go after Republicans for being too cozy with billionaires when you elect your own whose company has its own skeletons that will upset people? ",ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T10:49:52,-2

Somebody with a net worth of 60 times that or 6 million is. That's the difference between fdr and pritzker  Edit: to below commenter his net worth was 60 million after inflation adjustment.

At least those folks are pretty much mask off nowadays - I know that’s a weak silver lining but I at least don’t think that’s a reality that anyone will be able to underestimate with JB. Plus he’s also quite strong with deflecting that type of criticism and may actually prove to be an effective means of combating it out in the open.,ahdidi413,2025-04-28T10:29:13,3

I agree but there is at least a small segment of the progressive base that will be deeply skeptical of anyone in the billionaire class no matter how well aligned and proven they are with progressive policy.,ahdidi413,2025-04-28T10:33:55,4
"I could easily see him actually bolstering Bernie's arguments against billionaire oligarchy. I could see Pritzker saying, ""Trust me, I have personal experience with these guys, many of them are not good people. We need big money out of politics, so another JB Pritzker can never spend $300 million on a campaign again.""  What if Bernie and AOC ended up endorsing him, and he advocated for their voices to be heard in the Democratic Party?  I really would like to know! I'm trying to advocate for Pritzker's team to reach out to AOC/Bernie to create an alliance. :)",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-28T10:56:28,3

"As somebody who still thinks Biden was a stronger candidate than Kamala, voters aren't motivated by personal attacks like that. Age. Weight. They don't actually care.  They do seem to be motivated by stopping a woman president though.    I think pritzker could have issues motivating Democrats and independents to vote for him due to his wealth more than his weight.    Look at how effective the anti Musk stuff has been for Democrats. Democrats have a tendency to find a really effective line of attack and then completely abandon it in favor of helping the Republican party.    Think about the Iraq war. So very unpopular. Democrats won huge in 2006 and 2008 off it. Only to then after Obama repeatedly nominate candidates that supported it and become the perceived party of war instead ",ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T11:05:42,1

"I don't really care about repeating the Biden administration where we get nothing done and just hand over power to Republicans again in another 2 to 4 years.    Yeah maybe prtizker could beat vance or whoever. But how do you win big enough to actually get some things done this time?    Democrats did it in 06 and 08 by pinning the Iraq war and a recession on Republicans. To do that again it seems you'll need a recession and probably oligarchy as the two best issues for Democrats. Musk proved to be a huge liability for Republicans in Wisconsin.    The only reason Democrats would nominate a billionaire after that election is if they don't really want to win big because then their own members would have to be the ones blocking the reforms they pretend to support    Appears that dude blocked me, here is my response to his below post:   >The CHIPS act which brings actual manufacturing jobs back to America.   If voters wanted tax cuts for global corporations they can just elect Republicans   > The first infrastructure bill in 60 years.   Adjusted for inflation Obama's infrastructure bill was similar in size. I don't get the obvious lie here go inflate bidens accomplishments? If passing infrastructure was such an effective way to win elections it sure doesn't show up in the data   >Capping insulin   The US still has ever widening price gaps between our drugs and other countries. The gap isn't getting smaller but bigger. If during an inflationary crises Biden can't even majorly shrink that gap he obviously didn't actually care about lowering inflation    >Expanded overtime guarantees. Put a stop to discramnatory mortgage lending. Crackdown on junk and overdraft fees.    Some of that never went even went into effect   The best thing Biden did was the expanded child tax credit. But then the establishment called it ""moderate"" to get rid of that effectively creating the largest tax increase ever on Americans with children.    Where was the public option, the paid maternity leave, the increased minimum wage?  Anytime somebody leads off instead with tax cuts for global corporations you know it's gonna be a rough convo",ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T11:13:00,-2
