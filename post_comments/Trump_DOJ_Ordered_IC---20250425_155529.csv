"To MAGA: At what point are you guys going to recognize how serious this is? that we are headed into an authoritarian state where people can be detained without due process having not been charged with a crime? If you can't have the decency to realize how seriously awful, cruel, and evil this is at least admit that you don't care if something is awful and cruel. These are acts that are happening outside of the confines of the constitutional rights that all permanent residences are entitled to. The president is now, live on TV for all of us to hear, stating that sending US citizens to foreign prisons without charges or due process is something that is being considered. Now they're saying they can ignore the 4th amendment and break into peoples homes without ANY cause. How are you all not up in arms over what is literally by definition, authoritarianism? Something that is fundamentally counter to the very fabric of this country?  I think it's because you people genuinely either can't see it or you don't care. And I have a hard time knowing which is which. But I'll tell you right now, blood is on your hands, and history will not look kindly to you or anyone who condones this regardless of what happens next.  You are the evil that we were warned about. You are why after the holocaust we said ""never again"". You are the ones who stood by and either ignored it or are okay with it.

"These ICE agents are likely told they will need to start doing this warrantless searching.  But remember that during the first few weeks of Trump's new administration, ICE was not detaining/arresting very many people, other than known criminals. I guess they got in trouble for that and were given quotas or something, with the threat that they might lose their jobs. Most of them are intelligent men and women, and they know this aspect of the law - that to search without a warrant is illegal, despite what DOJ or Trump says, and the agents will be the ones charged, not Bondi or Trump. Although I would think Bondi could be charged. Trump can't because of his immunity.  So how many ICE agents will be willing to do this, knowing they will likely face court battles with little support? They see how the judges have many cases coming in, and they aren't dismissing them. Immigration attorneys will be eager to take on cases of illegal search. It is a right for everybody in this country, undocumented status or not, with exceptions made in imminently dangerous circumstances.

They do not understand words like authoritarianism, fascism, or oligarch. They do not understand that this is unprecedented, nor do they about the precedents being set, because they are not concerned with the past or future and only exist in a slavery to their own id.  One of the issues the left faces is that it is trying to communicate what's happening using college words and CSPAN theatrics when they need to dumbing things down to a fourth grade level and running ads during football games. Rather than the ""Fighting Oligarchy Tour"" that attracts exactly zero conservatives, why not run the ""No More Billionaires Tour""?

In that sense, the President could issue an order that could be characterized as a removal warrant, but only to effectuate the removal and only in those very specific circumstances.  But what we're talking about here is a warrant that would authorize law enforcement to enter the private residences of citizens just to look to see if they can find an ""alien enemy.""

"Liberalism and libertarianism are absolutely connected, you’re just confusing classical liberalism with modern progressivism.  Libertarianism is a branch of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism, developed in the 17th–19th centuries by thinkers like John Locke, Adam Smith, and later John Stuart Mill, centered around the ideas of individual rights, limited government, private property, and free markets. Libertarianism carries those core principles forward, emphasizing them even more strictly.  When you say “liberalism,” you’re probably thinking of modern left-progressivism, which evolved much later and moved away from classical liberalism’s original values.

"You’re misunderstanding libertarianism completely, and ironically, you’re describing the exact situation libertarians oppose.  First, there are millions of Americans who identify as libertarians. They may not all be in the Libertarian Party, but the core philosophy, maximizing individual liberty, minimizing coercive power, and limiting centralized authority, is alive and well. Dismissing it because you don't personally know many libertarians doesn’t change the reality.  Second, your ""corporate dystopia"" argument only makes sense if you ignore a key point:  Corporations don’t gain abusive power in a free market— they gain it by manipulating government regulations, subsidies, and legal protections. It's state power that creates and sustains corporate monopolies. Without government favors (like lobbying, special regulations that crush small competitors, and direct bailouts), megacorps wouldn’t have the means to dominate markets the way they do now.  Libertarianism isn’t about ""no rules"", it’s about preventing centralized, coercive power from being used against people, whether by government or corporations. In a truly free market with strong property rights and free competition, abusive monopolies are much harder to sustain because no one can legally use force to block competition.  You're thinking of anarcho-capitalism (ancap) when you describe ""no government at all.""  Libertarianism, especially in its classical form, advocates for limited government:  Protect life, liberty, and property Enforce contracts Prevent fraud and coercion That's it.  Government exists, but it’s restrained so it can’t be weaponized by corporations or politicians.  So ironically, what you call a ""ticket to a corporate dystopia"" is actually what we’re seeing right now, with bloated government and corporate collusion, and libertarians are the ones trying to stop it.",Vlongranter,2025-04-26T12:24:43,1

"The Nazis were literally *directly* following what Jim Crow had done. Hitler even talks about his admiration for Jim Crow laws in Mein Kampf. On what basis is it ""straight up wrong""? America was a big inspiration for parts of Nazi Germany's plan.  The racism was not learned from America, but the specific tactics they used were inspired by America. That's the point being made.",SerbianShitStain,2025-04-26T15:56:04,2
"The very last word in my original comment was ""denial"". Your exchange and refusal to accept the US doing exactly what it was known, and fought its own war over, for doing is why I used ""denial"" as the last word. Deny the facts all you like. It doesn't change what had happened, what was directly influenced in order to fulfill atrocities worldwide, and how those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.",harleyqueenzel,2025-04-26T18:51:33,0
"You’re missing the point entirely. It’s not about whether you or I know what the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy is. It’s about basic standards for sourcing if you want your argument to be taken seriously.  Wikipedia is not a credible source for citing definitions in a debate, because it’s user-edited and constantly shifting. That’s why literally every credible institution, from universities to professional organizations, warns against using it as a primary reference. If you want to define a logical fallacy, it takes almost no effort to pull from a real academic source, a logic textbook, or even a dictionary of philosophy. Instead, you lazily linked a crowdsourced website like it's definitive.  Second, on the actual substance: Fox News is not a libertarian outlet. Libertarianism (as a branch of classical liberalism) is definitionally not conservatism. Fox News is aligned with American conservatism (socially traditionalist, nationalist, and interventionist) which runs completely counter to the non-interventionist, anti-authoritarian principles libertarians believe in. Real libertarian media outlets are things like ReasonTV, The Libertarian Institute, or even The Mises Institute, not Fox News.  Your argument collapses because it’s based on a false equivalence: assuming libertarians are just another flavor of conservatives. They’re not, and you’re showing you don’t actually understand the ideologies you're trying to argue about.  Being technically aware of logical fallacies doesn’t make you correct if you don’t actually understand the topic you’re trying to argue about.",Vlongranter,2025-04-26T12:07:33,1

Libertarianism != Liberalism. It's considered a subgenre of classical liberalism in some circles but so is conservativism.  I love how libertarians are always so confidently incorrect.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-25T19:23:12,5

"I agree with that.  But on the other hand they are not indifferent to public opinion either.  ICE reversed the plan to cancel 1,500 student visas today, and they reversed the plan to cancel the 30+ year ongoing study into women's health.  Clearly they are watching  popularity numbers.     Trump seems on the one hand very detached in interviews saying he doesn't understand the question, and it doesn't seem to necessarily be evasion, there was an interview today where he was asked about the John Adams painting behind him and couldn't comprehend it.  But he's an obsessive television watcher and backpedaled on tariffs after a week of steep market declines.  I think he's pretty happy with the El Salvador deportations, but operationally it seems driven by Steven Miller and while he might hope for the insurrection act, I doubt it goes up to Trump.  It's a foolish idea anyway until they solidify control of the military.",I_who_have_no_need,2025-04-25T22:06:34,2

"No. Dunblane, Scotland 1996. 43 year old man with alleged history of sexual abuse as a Scout leader. He snapped over the allegations and entered the infant’s school one morning in March. He went to the gym where children were having a lesson killed 16 children, 1 teacher and injured 15 more children. Children were aged between 5 and 6 year old. He had 4 handguns (very unusual, I’ve never seen even one) and took only 2-3 minutes. The coward killed himself.  Horrifying and really shook up the whole country as gun crime was unheard of in a small Scottish village. Many memorials  were held obviously, Queen attended to show her respects.  Must have been a nightmare for the parents who rushed to the school trying to understand what all the noise was about and ambulances flying past.  Sandy Hook reminded me of that event. However US gun  laws since have become even weaker in some states which is incredibly sad but also induces much anger within me towards amoral lawmakers.  There are many articles about Dunblane on internet should my details not be accurate. It was from memory. Andy Murray, Wimbledon men’s tennis champion attended the school that day.",Auntie_Megan,2025-04-25T22:40:57,4
"This comment makes no sense, and is pretty much incoherent. But you do you my guy. My suggestion would be, that if you do bring up something historical, at least don't cherry pick.  Original post you responded to mentioned how what is happening in the US is similar to Nazism (which is true). Your flippant response was that Nazism and discrimination carried out by the Nazis was actually just the American south and Jim Crow laws in another form, and that America is just repeating its own racist history.  This is incredibly reductive, and honestly misinformed. Discrimination, fascism, and Nazism in Europe has its own significant history, steeped in anti-Semitism since literally the birth of Christ, transatlantic slavery since the 1400s, and absolutism since the dawn of time. Moreover, reducing America's history to just Jim Crow laws and the American south just shows a very simple and cursory understanding of American history.  I'm well aware of the trying times we live in. The only one guilty of denial, and a distinct lack of literacy here is the individual making incredibly simple minded self aggrandizing arguments, that may jive with redditors, but don't really indicate any great level of intelligence, critical thinking or just generally being well read.  In any case, I am not really going to waste any more of my time on this nonsense, good luck educating yourself. 👍🏽",RedScouse,2025-04-26T20:25:30,0
You are being dishonest in your argumentation.  You are using the no true scotsman fallacy.  THAT'S the issue.  You are trying to deflect. Stop it.  On the merits - the accusation people are making is that libertarians are hypocrites and liars about what they believe. You are just saying that the hypocrites and liars on not true libertarians.  You are using the above-referenced fallacy.,Spunkybrewster7777,2025-04-26T12:23:21,1

"1996 was when the Port Arthur massacre in Aus took place as well. Followed by the country volunteering their weapons up to the government as well and much stricter gun control laws. I never knew about Dunblane. I'm so glad both countries held up to rationality. My school JUST had a news report about concerned neighbors and it highlighted how there are shootings almost weekly across the street, where the kids skip school to go fight and hang out, etc. But then again I teach at one of the roughest schools that probably makes your prisons seem tame, ha. We have never had a shooting inside the school, but yes, every single week outside there's an occurrence. I fully understand the world viewing the US as one of the most bizarre countries on the planet.",mdh579,2025-04-26T07:40:52,1
"No, I’m being precise, you’re just misapplying the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy because you don’t actually understand the difference between a subjective purity test and a definitionally distinct category.  If I said, ""A real libertarian is someone who listens to my favorite bands,"" that would be a No True Scotsman fallacy because it’s subjective, arbitrary, and unrelated to the definition of libertarianism.  But saying, ""Libertarians, by definition, are not conservatives, and Fox News is a conservative outlet,"" is not a purity test, it’s a factual distinction based on the actual definition of the political philosophy.   Libertarianism emphasizes maximum individual freedom and minimal state intervention in both social and economic spheres. Conservatism, especially American conservatism, emphasizes tradition, authority, and often government intervention in social behavior. These are fundamentally different principles.  You’re not calling out a fallacy, you’re calling out your own misunderstanding of political philosophy.  And no, pointing out that you lazily cited Wikipedia is not deflection, it’s basic standards for sources if you want your arguments to be taken seriously. A reputable source takes all of 60 seconds to find.   If you actually want to continue the conversation intelligently, you need to stop falsely accusing others of fallacies you don’t understand and start addressing the actual definitions and distinctions being discussed.",Vlongranter,2025-04-26T12:41:38,1
