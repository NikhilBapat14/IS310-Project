"This article is an attempt to justify the whims of a megalomaniacal individual.  No one can give legitimacy to anything tRump is doing.  This article, with its use of flowery language mixed in with some actual fact and a dash of reason, is a nice try.  But you still can't put shine on shit.",jpcapone,2025-05-04T12:55:43,36
"What a load of horseshit. The author claims that the media has a left wing bias and is being unfair to Trump, whereas those of us who are in touch with reality know that conservative billionaires control the media.",PeepholeRodeo,2025-05-04T13:13:06,27
What a complete load of shit. Fuck Turley and fuck anyone that supports what Trump is doing.,addled_and_old,2025-05-04T12:59:20,21
Is their anyone more arrogant then Jonathan Turley?,veridique,2025-05-04T12:51:24,29
"I understand and even agree with some of the points about journalism and objectivity.  However, Trump is objectively bad, and so is the Republican Party for supporting him. Jonathan Turley is an incredibly biased fool himself.",Simmery,2025-05-04T12:48:56,24
The arrogance of NPR??? How about the authoritarian overreach of Project 2025 and maga? It’s fucking grating that anything that doesn’t lick maga balls is arrogant or elite.  The true arrogance is trump’s absolute assumption of power and the truth that he is above the law.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-04T12:59:22,20
"> The undoing of American journalism began in “J-schools,” where young reporters were taught that the touchstones of neutrality and objectivity were no longer viable. At schools like the University of Texas, students are told that it is time to “leave neutrality behind.” Stanford journalism professor, Ted Glasser, has insisted that “journalists need to be overt and candid advocates for social justice, and it’s hard to do that under the constraints of objectivity.”   The reason for the shift in the approach to journalism is simple. It certainly isn't for the noble intentions the professor implies (although he might truly believe that).   The American press is beholden to unfettered capitalism and its demand for increased profit year over year. That's all there is to it. Whatever brings the most eyes and ears to the product is the goal, and neither the media nor the consumer seems that concerned or even gives it thought.   Just look at the articles posted on this sub. The serious, denser stories are lucky to break 200 upvotes, while the nonsensical yet spectacular ones are voted to the top.",biscuitarse,2025-05-04T13:06:12,8
NPR has a *lot* of issues. Arrogance is not one of them.,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-04T13:13:21,7
Trump cut their funding because he wanted to.  He's  spending way more on his stupid little birthday parade. The funding for NPR and PBS was 87 million dollars his parade of stupidity is costing taxpayers 92 million dollars. Bso much for government efficiency.,axebodyspraytester,2025-05-04T13:40:52,7

Very little funding to npr comes from federal money. I think they’ll be okay. I need them to anyway.. one of the few news sources I trust,bigChungi69420,2025-05-04T13:43:06,4

This is so crazy for many reasons.,bdixisndniz,2025-05-04T12:55:46,3
NPR's coverage of the 2024 election was infuriating. They consistently legitimized the campaign of a person who should never have been allowed to run and normalized dangerous fascistic leanings from the gop.   I sure hope they're learning something here. Cautionary tale indeed.,E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-04T15:19:33,3
NPR normalized and sanewashed trump. he should be funding them,jmsy1,2025-05-04T13:49:25,4

"OK, so if this is true, Fox News, who was find $1 billion for lying for four months about a stolen election, would be next right? Because they are so politically leaning to the Alt right? For some reason, I'm gonna say that fox and Newsmax are safe. But I would LOVE to be proved wrong!! Unlike Maga...",Cherry_Valkyrie576,2025-05-04T15:22:23,2
"Turley is like all the other spokespeople for the alt-right - a third-rate mind, embittered at not being able to make it at the adults' table. Same as Victor David Hanson, Ben Shapiro, the whole lot of them. They are literally beneath contempt.  The real intellectual elites who generate the ideas that permeate the academy and eventually society laugh at them or ignore them.",Marxian_factotum,2025-05-04T21:00:47,2
