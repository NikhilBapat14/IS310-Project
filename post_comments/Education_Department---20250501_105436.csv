Republicans: It's not the guns! It's the mental health crisis that causes school shootings!   Also Republicans: Let's gut mental health services!,BlackOrre,2025-05-01T11:06:45,56

">The grants were part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – a bill passed in the aftermath of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which a teen gunman killed 19 elementary school students, two adults and injured 17 people. The bill, among other things, poured federal dollars into schools to address rising concerns about a student mental health crisis.  Nope, survivors don't need mental health help and the perpetrators don't need help before. *everything'sfinehouseonfirememe*",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-01T11:06:56,13

"This is so fucking dumb. I'm so done with this government. We have the WORSE school shooting stats. It happens so much more because Americans  see its fucking no hope anymore. That's why school shooting go up. We aren't handling the root cause, mental health. This is going to be one of the worse decades for America.",TheBetawave,2025-05-01T11:48:02,2
The only things the government is using our tax dollars for is corporate incentives…  We as citizens are simply funding our own collapse under debt. These corporations aren’t fixing the roads or upgrading our utilities. They are only putting them behind further paywalls and middlemen.  And now the next generation will be reeducated to embrace their lives under corporate slavery.,SimTheWorld,2025-05-01T11:29:44,2

"Well sure, as the mental health thing was an obvious lie from the start.  The real answer is they are fine with gun deaths as they are. The issue for them is they know that position is horrifyingly unpopular so they make up lies like these to get them through the wave of outrage after a mass shooting before returning to the status quo. ",eskimospy212,2025-05-01T11:32:24,1
