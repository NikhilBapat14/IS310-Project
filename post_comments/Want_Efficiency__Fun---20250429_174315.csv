The objective was never to drive efficiency.  It is to eliminate the department entirely.,Troubled202,2025-04-29T18:07:19,31
The same can be said for all the other DOGE cuts too.  Firing government workers just so they can pay more to private companies to do the same work does not cut costs or improve efficiency.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-29T17:46:28,20
We already went through this in AZ and veterans died waiting for services.,LostmydadtoCOVID,2025-04-29T20:21:28,10
It's always someone getting a cut in the world of privatized things.,thieh,2025-04-29T17:54:54,9
When these fools in power keep souring on waste and fraud. What they really mean is that the money is going back to the taxpayers is considered waste and fraud. When the money goes to one private person. That’s when it’s considered a good run operation!!,tacs97,2025-04-30T09:49:45,3
"I fought the VA for years to get disability benefits for my husband. He’s a Purple Heart Vietnam Vet. He was finally diagnosed with a horrible type of Parkinson’s; he has frequent episodes of no balance resulting in severe, injurious falls. The only salvation to all this was COMMUNITY CARE. We live very rurally and the closet VA facility is 3 hours away. It has been a godsend that he can get treatment at our local clinic and hospital.",Sknowles12,2025-04-29T22:42:14,2
"Intentionally reduce the VA to a crumbling mess then say ""see how useless it is? Vets deserve better"".  Run a huge propaganda campaign to convince Americans, including vets, that privatizing the VA will be great for veterans - I've already seen this starting. Many vets (or ""vets"") are already parroting these ideas in vet subs.   This isn't fear mongering, this is what they want to do - privatize the VA and reduce veterans benefits. Some of this is in p2025. Some of it comes from the mouths of GOP reps.  Veteran suicide rates will skyrocket. Veteran homelessness will skyrocket. Veteran disability benefits will be drastically reduced or cut.    Too many veterans are too happy with their heads comfortably up trumps ass to see that this admin and the GOP in general *hates* veterans. They prove it time and again when it comes time to improve or expand on veterans programs.   Trump doesn't care us suckers and losers. We're a burden to him.",SordidHobo93,2025-04-29T22:50:37,10
It's an easy and efficient way of getting money into the corporate owner's pockets.  But even this is being optimistic as many of these services will cease to exist.,CockBrother,2025-04-29T19:06:25,6
A lot has changed with the VA since the situation in Arizona.,-Poliwrath-,2025-04-29T21:38:28,1
There’s a big difference between some vets using community care and 8 million vets swarming community care at once. That’s what will happen if the VA gets privatized. It already takes months and months to get appointments in the private health care and adding 8 million more veterans to this already bloated system just doesn’t make sense,kmm198700,2025-04-30T00:12:36,8
"I'm glad.  Now tell your elected representatives to properly fund community care so its expansion doesn't fiscally tank VA as a whole.  That's the gimmick.  The MISSION Act, the PACT Act, and the COMPACT Act all expand care without increasing the budget.",Proud-Wall1443,2025-04-30T05:00:57,7
"Expect 45 minutes wait on any call to the VA. Let them lose a critical brain mri, tell u they lost ALL your prescriptions, and get lost in the referral process.",Sknowles12,2025-04-29T22:48:02,-2
I've never had any of those happen.  Of course there can be problems but I've been with the VA a long time and they have been at least as good as any other medical system I've used.,-Poliwrath-,2025-04-30T08:15:02,1
Same. Also anytime I have a new problem they are right on it.  Granted I do a lot of local doctors in the community too as the va is 300 miles away and the CBOP takes pretty good  care of us.   Technically I know the care is getting better as my whole life I’ve been aware of the VA. Both my parents worked for the VA and I heard plenty of stories about the doctors and specialist at the dinner table.  Sometimes they said the only reason the doctors worked the va was they couldn’t make it on the outside.  ( My dad was pretty high up in the VA and my mother was an RN). So I know the quality of care has greatly improved and I’m receiving it good care.,Final_Froyo_9078,2025-04-30T19:23:23,1
