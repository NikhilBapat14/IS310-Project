"Or not towing the line & admitting the crime:  The Tarrio case — and hundreds of others like it — function as a vivid reminder of the violent chaos fueled by Trump’s lies around the election and the extent to which his false claims helped inspire right-wing extremists who ultimately stormed the Capitol to thwart the peaceful transfer of presidential power.  Rising to speak before the sentence was handed down, Tarrio pleaded for leniency, describing Jan. 6 as a “national embarrassment,” and apologizing to the police officers who defended the Capitol and the lawmakers who fled in fear. His voice cracked as he expressed remorse for letting down his family and vowed that he is done with politics.

Inflicting harm or changing the results of the election was not my goal,” Tarrio said.  “Please show me mercy,” he said, adding, “I ask you that you not take my 40s from me.”",WILLIAMEANAJENKINS,2025-05-05T19:23:07,1
