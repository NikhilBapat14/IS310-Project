Australia makes up like 1 percent of US steel imports and 2 percent of aluminum imports. I'm surprised this even made Trumps radar. I am sure we will see people moving away from foreign conservative leaders that would have normally aligned with Trump until now.,andrewb05,2025-03-16T19:40:59,39
The tariffs are incredibly small compared to Australia’s exports. It was also not targeted as the tariff was given to all countries.  The tariff doesn’t mean much when it is such a small percentage of steel and aluminum exports and Australia already has a trade surplus with the US.  In reality this will have pretty little effect on Australia’s elections as the tariffs will cause very little economic disruptions.,WalterWoodiaz,2025-03-16T19:41:54,12
"The major swings in Canadian politics are because Trump is trying to annex Canada, not simply because of the tariffs themselves. There's no comparison here to Australia, which Trump isn't trying to annex.  Americans seem to have a really hard time grasping that people in other countries seriously care about their sovereignty.",TheRadBaron,2025-03-16T20:29:43,11
For real? Damn even Australia is getting shots taken? I'm confused why he is aiming at allies 1st. Makes more sense to dump tariffs on everyone that doesn't agree with the US.,Pale-Candidate8860,2025-03-16T18:57:22,13
"I doubt it. Several reasons.  Firstly, Dutton has not been anywhere near as Pro Trump as the Canadian conservatives were, he has played it very well. Secondly, our sovereignty hasn't been attacked yet by Trump. Thirdly, Labor's response to the tariffs has been piss-weak.  It may change however, with the Libs essentially trying to bribe Trump by giving away our rare metals for basically nothing to stay in his good books. That may gain some traction, but it seems like both parties at the moment are on their knees waiting from some Trump schlong.",sinred7,2025-03-16T20:25:45,3
"It already has, but not in the material impact of the potential costs of the tariffs. Tariffs generally aren't too much of a problem to Australia because we're exporting base resources in high demand, finding a new market for them will be relatively straightforward compared to the tariff war Trump is waging with Canada.   The major impact is that candidates are being forced to respond by media on how they would react to Trump and whether they agree with him, which is a huge problem for the convervative party (Liberals) leader Peter Dutton as he's nurtured nationalistic and Trumpian ideals for decades and now has to act like he never sucked up to the guy.   Also, on a level that's far more important at a global scale, Trump is causing AUKUS to be dragged into the spotlight for scrutiny. For people unaware, Australia previously was in a huge geopolitical shitshow because the Liberal government from a previous term cancelled a contract for submarines from the French to instead contract the US to produce nuclear subs. This is extremely controversial as:  A. These submarines wouldn't be produced for decades and not expected to enter service till the 2040s (and consider how frequent delays are in military procurement, especially for something as complicated as a nuclear sub)  B. [Could cost up to $368 billion over 30 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/aukus-nuclear-submarines-australia-commits-substantial-funds-into-expanding-us-shipbuilding-capacity). The Australian defence budget is $764 billion *over a decade*, this is a procurement issue with dramatic implications.   C. Australia is nuclear free and the majority of the population wants that to remain - which state would even allow a nuclear submarine to dock is contested.  D. The Australian government hasn't given a clear pitch on why we even need nuclear submarines as opposed to modernised diesel (don't at me armchair generals this is from the perspective of the average voter)  E. It locks us in to the American side with a potential war with China, in which Australia has so much to lose.   That Trump is willing to threaten us, when we have openly and formally committed to be their staunch military ally, is making AUKUS seem less like being under the safety umbrella of the US and more like a situation where the US could last minute not honour the submarine contract just because the President feels like it AND could be creating a geopolitical event where we would absolutely NEED those submarines.   So to answer the question, Trump's rhetoric towards Australia and its wider international relations is causing a crisis for the upcoming election that candidates have to respond to.",TFT_Enjoyer,2025-03-16T22:21:21,4
"Answer: it shouldn’t but it will.  The U.S. is only our third biggest export target for Steel and we’re not even in the top 10 for the U.S. Even then, the U.S. will take years to grow its own steel industry out to make the difference from all its import partners and the local steel industry will raise prices since it’s in demand until their entire manufacturing industry is paying more and adding that cost onto the very vehicles and other goods they hope to sell and export, making them less competitive to the world.  This will grow the foreign manufacturers who will increase their own demand for steel and begin making up the difference.  HOWEVER, the politicians and media have turned it into a big talking point and deal so that it will impact the coming election.  Frankly, Australia really does need to grow its steel and other processing industries fast so we can stop relying on the Chinese steel and processing to buy all our raw resources at high prices because the U.S. trade war with China could well see their industry collapse and we don’t want nothing but a pile of Iron ore we can’t do anything with.",KUBrim,2025-03-16T22:05:47,1
"Trump did not just impose tariffs on Canada. He has repeatedly outright threatened to annex them and said that Canada should be the 51st state. Also, much of Conservative's lead in the poll originated from the fact that the Liberal prime minister was Trudeau and he has long been widely hated but now that he has stepped down and replaced as PM by a banker who was never formally part of his cabinet, this is no longer a factor in affecting how Canadians vote. Not to mention Pierre Poilievre himself is not that popular meaning Trudeau leaving is as much a lifesaver for the Liberals as much as Trump.  Then there is also the fact that in the most populous province Ontario, the Conservatives under Doug Ford's leadership just easily won their third consecutive term.  As for Australia, the Liberal' lead in the polls has never been large enough to be outside the margin of error. Australia having enforced compulsory voting means that an upset victory for Labour similar to Liberal's victory in 2019 is very much possible.",GalahadDrei,2025-03-16T23:45:25,1
"It's not a total collapse of the Conservative party in Canada, it just screwed up their election strategy. The liberals are still currently the underdog to win the next federal election, they're just way, way better off now than before Trump took office (and before Trudeau resigned.)  I don't think Australia has the same potential gains compared to Canada. It wasn't just the tariffs but also the ""51st state"" comments which were taken very seriously and infuriated most Canadians (right and leftwing) and essentially, at least temporarily, bridged some of the Liberal vs Conservative divide in the country and refocused it as Canada vs USA.   I don't see Australia getting as much out of Trump as Canada did in this regard.",Dark_Wing_350,2025-03-17T00:19:56,1
"Yes, they already have. We've seen a swing to the incumbent government since Trump's tariff announcement and our opposition has MPs openly siding with Trump's tariffs and ideals. Like with Canada, albeit to a far lesser extent given the lack of invasion threats, Australia is predictably reacting to American power overreach by the Trump Administration",semaj009,2025-03-17T14:45:14,1
"It was a blanket tariff, not one that targeting Australia specifically.  That is the real difference. The Australian election will be mainly decided on cost of living and immigration policy. Unlike Canada though, the US hasn’t targeted Australia with any specific tariff or threats of sovereignty. So that also makes a similar Canadian situation unlikely.",WalterWoodiaz,2025-03-16T19:49:32,11
"> In reality this will have pretty little effect on Australia’s elections as the tariffs will cause very little economic disruptions.  Yes, it won't cause disruptions (at all) but in terms of public image, I'd think that it makes conservatives look worse, doesn't it?

"Agreed. If Trump came out and said something like ""AUKUS is the most unfair deal in history! Australia is TOTALLY reliant on the US! We can make Australia the most secure country in the Pacific if it join the US as the beautiful 52nd state!"", that would change things.",Illustrious-Pound266,2025-03-17T16:54:14,4

"Because trump’s world view is you are either a sucker / loser, or you are a powerful dude (like Putin) who takes advantage of the other losers.

"It was a blanket tariff on all nations, not a targeted one for Australia.  Most Australian steel and aluminum goes to Japan and other Asian countries.  Australia imports more from the US, and already has trade agreements that make trade efficient. I somewhat doubt Australia will have a targeted tariff, maybe a blanket tariff affects them more in the future though.",WalterWoodiaz,2025-03-16T19:44:09,2
"I don’t think a Labor win will be much of an upset. Labor has gained in the 3 of the last 5 polls in the last two months - conveniently in line with Trumps presence. Labor in WA state election exceeded expectations (44 seats to 6).   Sentiment to Labor is still warm enough. Trump being Trump will move Australians further left I suspect, just as we did drastically after COVID.   Dutton is trying to play it smart, but he’s not generally well liked so he has a bit of an uphill battle. He also isn’t an ‘unknown’ politician so he can’t really distance himself from his past Trumpian rhetoric that well. Alas, he’s playing a smarter game than I anticipated.   He’s also throwing out isolationist, ‘don’t get involved’ rhetoric re Ukraine which I think a minority of voters will buy but generally speaking the sentiment towards Ukraine is sympathetic. I suspect Australians will vote with Trump and world affairs in mind and I don’t see that helping Liberals much at all.",SadDaughter100,2025-03-17T06:41:17,1

"While Trumps tariffs were not originally targeting Australia specifically, Trump denying Australias direct request to be added to the exemption list, most likely came off as feeling targeted against Australia to the Australian people.

">Labour might use this as a move to stop Conservative support, but most **moderates** and conservative supporters don’t really care much about this.  I don't agree with this. Given how the Liberal leader is consciously trying to ape Trump, the current instability in US isn't really looking good on him. Not to mention that unlike US, turnout is not a factor in Australia's compulsory, preferential electoral system.     I think what is likely to happen instead will be similar to the just finished WA state election, there will be swings against Labor but not to the Liberal-National Coalition exclusively with a significant amount going to independents and third-parties. This will push Labor to the finish line since they start off with more seats especially if the Teals retained their seats.",Sumiklab,2025-03-17T06:05:39,2

Tell me you're not Aussie without telling me you're not a fellow Aussie. Firstly, it's Labor. Secondly, our conservative equivalent is the Liberal Party, moderates are a bizarre concept because Liberal moderates are just liberals. The Liberal Party's own base including what in the US would be Dems means there's a real vulnerability for the Liberal Party's conservative elements backing Trump to drive liberal/moderate voters to independent or third party options, if not Labor, this election, and we're seeing that reflected in the rise in Labor's 2pp polling the last few weeks, not to mention the decline in the Liberal Party's primary vote. Our preferential election system means it's not a two horse race in every seat, and this means Trumpist rhetoric and policies affect Australia in ways that can be profound.",semaj009,2025-03-17T14:51:28,1
