How the fuck do you tariff a movie? Does he think there's container ships pulling into San Francisco with containers full of VHS tapes or something?,HanshinFan,2025-05-04T18:54:24,538
"What exactly does “produced” mean in this context? Actual foreign films that are made entirely outside of the United States? Or does this mean that you can’t even make a domestic film that includes material shot outside of the United States? What exactly is it that’s being tariffed, and how? Just… what?",throwawaylol666666,2025-05-04T18:53:57,205
">*Hollywood, meaning the American film industry, derives a significant portion of its revenue from international markets, with estimates indicating that almost70%of its box office revenue now comes from abroad. This means that foreign audiences contribute a larger share of profits than domestic audiences in the film industry.

I want to be clear, I strongly believe that these measures, almost all of them, are not born from the mind of Trump. At this point, and it should be clear to every American, the Republican party is taken advantage of Trump and his idiocy. They keep him propped up and in exchange they quickly ram through bills and executive orders that would otherwise fall flat.   Everything, all of these executive orders, save the ones related to Tariffs, are the wishes of Republican lawmakers and their financers. Trump does not care about legislation, he does not care about the will of the people, and he most certainly does not care about whether he is executing on his Presidential responsibilities; he gets to appear powerful and that's all that matters to him.   The GOP and DNC are cooked. Even if they were to impeach, they are cooked. Their miscalculation has led the USA to the brink of civil war and the world to the brink of another World War. None of what I wrote should be viewed as making an excuse for Trump as he is most certainly a willing participant in this whole situation.

"Let's talk this seriously. Or at least as seriously as he thinks it is.   > “any and all” movies produced in “foreign lands.”   Movies, especially the big studio movies like THUNDERBOLTS or the next MISSION IMPOSSIBLE picture, are the products of... well, lots of things.   To start what does ""produced"" mean? Does it mean shooting location? Does it mean financed? Does it mean having post production effects designed and rendered? Does this refer to animated films written and created in the US but drawn in the Republic of Korea?   There are very few movies that are solely produced in any single country. A lot of films end up as multi-national efforts because financing comes from different countries in exchange for distribution or streaming rights. A film shot entirely in France with solely French cast AND crew may have effects work completed in the Czech Republic. Which is fine, because the financing may also have come from a Chinese company and an Indian company in exchange for distribution by those companies in China and India respectively.   Let's say thus hair brained scheme goes through and foreign companies effectively stop showing their movies in the US. Studios, knowing their product is going to be taxed beyond current taxes, may just stop trying to exhibit in the US.   Think about that. Any high profile pictures coming out in the next few years? Like... I dunno... another AVENGERS movie?   Some part of that will not be native to the US. Locations won't be in the US, effects work sure as hell won't be in the US, pretty sure not every actor will be a US citizen... and odds are some other company will put in money that isn't American.   So Disney, knowing they won't get a decent return on their investment (probably around $500M US after production and post) because their costs in the US are now double for no good reason, may just hold off on bringing it to US shores. Foreign returns often outnumber US returns.   Think about that, a highly anticipated film being effectively banned in the US. The pirates will go nuts, of course, but that may be a small fraction and Disney has resources to make the effort painful.   The US? It'll become an afterthought for most of the big pictures and almost all of the small ones.   All that said, this is a shakedown by trump of Hollywood. He wants some concessions, entire movies of characters praising him or AI recreations of himself as Captain America or something equally nauseating, and definitely kickbacks. For example, the next STAR WARS movie can't be released without tarrifs unless he gets 1% of the gross. He's betting on the big media companies like Apple and Disney to buckle (in the case of Disney, they already have at least once- let's see if they're willing to share on their BIG moneymakers).   Even more disturbing, this is an attempt to kill the unapproved culture. Anyone want to guess what changes his underlings would demand of something like SINNERS? A deeply critical film of the US and its race issues. Pretty sure there was some foreign investment somewhere in that production.   Anything that doesn't fit their brain wormed standards, which will Never be consistent, will get taxed up the wahoo deliberately crippling its ability to earn.",sdcinerama,2025-05-04T22:08:09,2

End to end very little is actually produced fully within the USA as in general, through grants and just sometimes pure geography - it doesn't always make sense to shoot fully in the USA.   Then we get down to cost.  Where the dollar stretches further, VFX and Post Production is just cheaper.    Then we get into how do you tariff a digital good.   Do you redefine what a tariff is?  This opens the door to taxation on all digital goods?  This idea is about as well thought out as you would expect from Trump.

"None of that is true.   Even before the Nazis rose to power there was practically a civil war in Germany.   That's actually why Hitler was declared chancellor.   Because Hindenburg thought by declaring Hitler chancellor the riots would stop,   and many top politicians and influential rich folks thought they could control Hitler.   Hitler's party did not get enough votes during the 1933 election, but they got support from the Conservatives and several of the center, center-right and liberal parties.   Until that point left-wing and right-wing groups had been fighting on the streets.    Armed and all.   Apparently the political establishment thought by backing the extreme right-wing with Hitler at the top who they thought to be a joke and easily controlled they could restore order. (or what they thought of as order)   So when there was no clear winner during the 1933 elections Hindenburg made Hitler chancellor and his party founded a coalition with one of the conservative parties and then the fascists went to work and dismantled the state...  They had to use the police and military (plus their private army of fanatics, the brown shirts who now had the support of police and military)   to round up all the Marxists and leftist groups, all the politicians on the left,   famous people who were vocal against the Nazis, etc.  None of that went down smoothly. People were fighting. But the combined forces of police, military and brown shirts was overwhelming in the end.  Things ""calmed down"", if you want to call it that, when all those who opposed the Nazis were either behind bars, in labor camps or dead.   And of course some had fled the country.  It's complete BS to paint it like everyone just saw the Nazis grab the power and then shut up and played along. That's not what happened.  The Nazis had to break a fierce resistance and could never 100% do it. There were pockets of freedom fighters the whole time. And whenever the Nazis' grip around a town or city slipped there was a backlash.  It's also not true that Germany didn't have states. It did. Still does.   But you have to understand that the Nazis replaced all the high-ranking politicians within a short amount of time.   They also made it impossible for anyone not a member of the Nazi party to hold any office. So that made it really easy for them to spot people who weren't supporters.   If someone in an official capacity refused to become a party member the Nazis were sure that person wasn't going along with their plans.     The big difference is: the US are vast. And even though its military is massive, there are too many people and there's too much space to hide that even police and military and police combined could control the whole country.   There are also more armed civilians in the US.   And not everyone in the US military would go along with orders to attack US civilians.   Actually, I think most US soldiers wouldn't follow these orders.   People in the US have to worry more about police than soldiers.   But it's totally possible to crush Trump and his regime peacefully.   If enough people go on the streets.   If enough people go to Washington and protest there and make it clear they won't leave until Trump leaves.   Imagine 2 million people protesting in Washington. What that would mean for the city.   And 2 million is not even 1% of Americans.   There could easily be five million protesters. How the f\*ck would the police control that crowd? They couldn't.   And if they were trying to do that by force they'd truly start a civil war.  Also gotta think outside the box... another form of protest could be not to go to work.   If only 5-10 people out of a hundred won't work any more the country comes to a halt.   People could also deliberately f\*ck up their work or slow it down. Especially effective if they work in the public sector.   The whole country would just stop. And it would get worse with every week that passes.   The Trump administration could not stay in power if this happens.",Barbarus_Bloodshed,2025-05-04T19:59:38,12
California is the 4th largest economy in the world. If we leave a third of this country is fucked without the money we give to them through taxes. Would they let us leave willingly? Probably not.
