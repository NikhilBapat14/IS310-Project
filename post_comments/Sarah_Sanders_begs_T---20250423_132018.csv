"The plea for help marks a significant departure from statements Sanders made in 2023.  “As long as I am your governor, the meddling hand of big government creeping down from Washington DC will be stopped cold at the Mississippi River,” she wrote in a post on X in January 2023.",NotUrDadiBlameUrMoma,2025-04-23T13:26:40,3697

January ’23, I declared it loud—‘the meddlin’ hand of big government shall be stopped cold at the Mississippi!’* Thought meself a lion then. But now, look at me—soaked, broken, and knockin’ on the gates of Washington with blistered hands.  I swore I’d never need ye, and now I beg ye… call me hypocrite, I won’t deny it. I mocked the takers, but I take now, gladly. I turned away help, but cry for it now. I was proud, but pride don’t rebuild nor feed the starvin’. Please, Mr. Trump… alms, kind sir… alms for the poor.”*  ⸻  [TOWNSFOLK muttering and jeering in the background]  Old Farmer (spits): “Didn’t want Washington’s meddlin’ last year—now she wants their money?”  Young Mother (clutching child): “She turned her back on us then, and now she wants us to clap while she begs?”  Grizzled War Vet (shaking his head): “Hypocrite’s hat’s off now, ain’t it?

"This is the problem when you start talking about truly large numbers - people just can't comprehend them. The numbers DOGE is throwing, that Sanders threw out, all of it, it's too large for the average person to comprehend. So they just get overwhelmed and accept it without really thinking about it.  But if you critically think about it at all, you realize how it crumbles. First, to claim to have uncovered such huge amounts of money in such a short time is just ridiculous. In that short amount of time, you can't determine if that money is truly wasteful or inefficient, or if it's a critical but not immediate, like load bearing wall that seems out of place. You can tear out a load bearing wall and may not notice anything bad from doing so, at least not immediately. But eventually, you see why it was needed.  Then there's simply the amounts talked about. They are huge dollar amounts, viewed alone. So if you just assume they are wasteful, then yes, that seems like a huge savings. But when viewed as a percent of overall budget, they're practically rounding errors - they're little holes in the hull of a ship. And just as a thousand little holes can sink a ship just as surely as a large one, severity matters. A large hole in a ship anywhere is cause for concern. A two inch hole below the water line is a concern. A two inch hole in a door to a closet, not so much. But they're treating everything like it's a torpedo-sized hole below the waterline, when in reality, what they're reporting amounts to BB-sized holes in a lounge chair on the Lido deck.  What they're doing is throwing away the life preservers to save the chairs at the captain's table.",Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-04-23T13:52:45,85

The majority of Trump voters couldnt have predicted how their votes would manifest in destroying our national standing, ignoring due process, locking people in foreign prisons. I don't wish those things on the people who didn't knowingly vote for them.

"You’re not wrong, but unless these brainwashed folks FEEL the implications of the rhetoric, how can things change? All of the programs and agencies that are being slashed were created for a reason. Most voters have lost sight of that reason. So this may be what it takes to reeducate them as to why these are necessary.   1) Farmers overwhelmingly supported Trump. His trade wars are limiting their ability to sell crops overseas. Furthermore, the dismantling of USAID has stripped farmers of one of their largest sources of revenue: the food the government pays for to feed the hungry in poor countries. Hopefully their financial burdens will correct their view on macroeconomics and foreign aid.   2) Red states overwhelmingly supported Trump. They also are mostly states that receive more federal money than contribute. Social welfare program cuts, which all republicans get hard over, are going to drastically affect their population. This lack of funding will not only hurt these individuals, but the overall state economies as well. Less money being spent in a state means less sales tax, less revenue for the firms providing the goods and services, and so on. Maybe this will change the voting public that social welfare actually has more benefit than not. Trump is also doing everything he can to dismantle labor protections on a federal level, and these states are mostly right to work states. Once the lives of laborers in these states get bad enough maybe they will see the benefits of unionization and employee protections.   3) Major capital investors and CEOs overwhelmingly support Trump and republicans economics. The trade wars are in the process of decimating supply lines, as well as making the average American poorer in real terms. Maybe when their businesses start failing they will realize that having all the money at the top is actually bad for the economy.   I’m not saying I want people to suffer, because I most certainly do not. What I am saying is that these people have been brainwashed since Reagan to believe ridiculous economic theories that have no basis in mathematics, economics, or the real world, and as an economist I am tired of having to tell people that the things they are saying are bullshit.",MightbeGwen,2025-04-23T14:52:09,8
