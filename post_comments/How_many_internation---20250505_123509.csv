"Hey r/politics, Nikol from USA TODAY here. After thousands of international students had their visas revoked in April, the Trump administration reversed course, saying it is restoring the student visa registrations of potentially thousands of foreign students in the United States.   As of the 2023-2024 school year, an estimated 1.1 million international students study in the United States. USA TODAY reporters looked at which universities host the most international students and where the concentration of student visas was revoked:  A database tracking total student visa terminations found that more than 1,800 international students and recent graduates had their legal status changed. The data is based on public reports and direct correspondence compiled by Inside Higher Ed. The number could be even higher − the database notes that several universities did not indicate the number of visas that had been revoked.  **See maps with all the stats breakdowns here:** [**https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/05/03/how-many-international-students-visas-revoked/83216625007/**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/05/03/how-many-international-students-visas-revoked/83216625007/)",usatoday,2025-05-05T12:35:32,3
