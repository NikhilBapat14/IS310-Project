So how does this work? I don't think the Army corps of engineers will do the mining. Will American companies pay the US and Ukraine to mine there?,papaHans,2025-04-30T17:49:12,2

"I just can't belive how many people in here are saying this is a bad thing. After all this time we finally did something that is promising aid to Ukraine (of course the US gets something in return, I mean come on, these are nation states, not a handshake between two buddies), yet many of you are upset. I'm convinced half of you just WANT to be mad at Trump no matter what. The US will never find political peace while half of its left voters and half of its right voters hate each other no matter what transpires. Please think for yourselves and not as a ride-or-die team or we are boned for eternity.",zacguymarino,2025-05-01T06:26:40,2
"After reading these articles, leading up to this, I couldn't help wishing Ukraine said NO!  Trump is taking horrible advantage of these poor people and this has nothing to do with ending the war!  Trump is beyond evil!! :(",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T18:06:13,2
Disgusting.  We just watched an abusive bully shake down his victim....who has been standing up for all of us.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-30T17:35:33,4
"Reality of what likely happens: trump offers ukraine military in exchange for minerals. Sends military, except they're ordered to help russia because putin offers to go 50/50 on minerals and whatever other resourcea ukraine has.

"Just lost a lot of respect for zelensky. You don't bow down to one dictator to save yourself from another. I understand he's in a tough situation, but this will end up backfiring in the long run. ",Bakedads,2025-04-30T18:27:52,-2

"I mean we have no idea what the actual details are yet unless I just missed it. But for Ukraine the minerals will be used as basically a buffer between Russia and them. If Russia wants to attack Ukraine in the future they’d be attacking American investments, which would obviously be tragic for them ",snuggie_,2025-04-30T18:31:47,3
"Eh, it's not that much difference than what the US has been doing since the war started.  US involvement has always been focused on US interests first and Ukraine interests second.  Biden could've easily supplied everything Ukraine needed to hold off the invasion, but made sure to trickle stuff in instead to ensure the war continued and Russia would be dragged down in it. That big failed Ukraine offensive early on was because the US at the time refused to provided much needed long range artillery, and even at the end, Biden was very restrictive on what Ukraine could use their platforms for.",SpectreFire,2025-04-30T22:58:27,1

While it's definitely going to backfire I'm not sure if it looks more like this deal was forced on him than choosen. He is just backed into a corned by 2 large bullies (usa and russia)  but I mean losing respect for him might go far considering everything they're dealing with,Dark2820,2025-04-30T18:46:58,1
Is it that different from America robbing Britain blind in exchange for aiding it in WW2 (in the words of Britain's own ex-PM Boris Johnson)? Sometimes you really don't have a choice.,GeneReddit123,2025-04-30T18:58:23,1

"Either way, we both know Trump made it so Zelensky has his back against the wall.   Trump is taking advantage and does NOT care one iota about the country or the people.  The same way he doesn't care about America or the people who live here.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T18:58:40,2
"Well China and Canada provide the us most of these minerals, and Trump has tariffed both countries especially in these areas but isn’t tarrifing these from Ukraine",Mundane_Quality8858,2025-04-30T19:46:29,0
"Ok, so still giving support to them, just an exchange of goods for that?  Edit: how does this stop the war? It’s just ‘we gave you this, give us this back?’ Is it not? Or are the US and Russia going halvsies? I’m so confused",popsy13,2025-04-30T17:55:59,1
"I agree for sure. When I do something nice for someone I don’t expect something in return. However that still doesn’t make it bad for Ukraine. If I offered to help someone move for a lunch, maybe I should have offered for free, but it’s still a good deal for both sides",snuggie_,2025-04-30T19:01:32,2
It sounds like you are just making things up because something good happened lol.,Upset_Front104,2025-04-30T19:37:43,2
"This isn’t just about Ukraine and Russia, this also puts pressure on china’s overwhelming control of rare earth minerals.  Yes, Trump is a bully, and a disgusting human, but giving the US a deal that turns Ukraine into a national security interest for us isn’t really a bad thing for them.",Inappropriate_Comma,2025-04-30T22:16:30,1
And somehow in that head you think it's Ukraine's fault that the US isn't putting tariffs on them but he is on Canada?   WTF are you talking about?,scubahood86,2025-05-01T06:18:22,1
"The US gains a national security interest in Ukraine with this deal, putting pressure on Russia to tread carefully.  This also puts pressure on China and their overwhelming control of rare earth minerals.",Inappropriate_Comma,2025-04-30T22:13:12,3
