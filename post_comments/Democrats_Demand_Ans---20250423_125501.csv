Greed and a massive miscalculation.,namideus,2025-04-23T13:29:58,17
Lawyer’s professional duty to uphold justice and fairness doesn’t have anything to do with a jury’s decision. I don’t know what point you’re trying to make there.   You were wrong when you tried to claim this issue doesn’t have anything to do with morals. You also said you weren’t here to argue about this yet here we are,cooliseum,2025-04-23T18:17:57,2
"People got mad at me when I said it but law firms aren't working off principle they made the simple calculation that it's easier and cheaper to roll over now than face years of possible targeting and litergation against trumps fed, they could fight it but again that could take years and a lot of work away from stuff that makes them money and keeps the lights on.  The law is about what's legal not about what's right.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T13:25:53,5

Lawyers are expected to act within the confines of the law _and_ ethics. Rolling over was a breach of their duty to act ethically as officers of the courts.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T13:50:27,26
"The lawyers are about convincing others what the law actually means, but also what it actually doesn’t means.",Lost_Minds_Think,2025-04-23T15:12:52,1
Eh they may have made that calculation but it may be miscalculated. The administration kind of has the attention span of a goldfish,JohntheAnabaptist,2025-04-23T20:22:58,1
"Go complain to them then, I am not here to argue the ethical thing to do I am saying why they did it.  You want an ethical discussion then have it with someone else because I am not arguing the finer points of law and ethics with you because I heard it all last time and it changed nothing.  The law isn't nessecarily ethical, that's by nature it's often used as a tool of the state to police dissent and enforce e the will of the capital and class upoj everyone else. If was ethical and fair then half the execs in the US would be on death row.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T13:53:20,-5
Don't get mad at me.. You're the one who signed off with:  > The law is about what's legal not about what's right.  On a topic about law firms being questioned about their ethical breaches.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T14:14:14,7
Then they said “don’t argue with me…” like you can just say something objectively false then walk away,cooliseum,2025-04-23T16:46:56,2
Keep believing in the system as you watch billionaires face no justice and get years or months when normal people get decades.  Literally meaningless unless they get prosecuted and they most certainly won't. Feel free to come back to this when it's over and you can admit you were wrong.,LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T17:51:10,1
"Dude, no one thinks lawyer and thinks “ethical” what are you even arguing for. I don’t disagree that hats what the book says sure but be so real right now.",Lanko-TWB,2025-04-23T17:27:54,-1
"What did I say that was wrong? How much time did Trump serve for fraud, sexual assault and dozens of cases of breaching contracts and breaching court orders?  How much time did Conrad Black serve for all his fraud that should have him sent away for decades?  How much time did OJ Simpson serve?  How much time did Casey Anthony serve?  Nothing because the lawyers and justice system worked within the law not within what's ethical and moral. (Conrad back got around 6 years and served around 3 years)",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T17:57:45,0
"My point was also the law doesn't mean that's what they will fight for, what's the point in fighting for years for no profit and waste resources they can send to clients.  Was Casey Anthonys lawyer tried for ethics? No because the law doesn't mean doing what's right, it's about doing what's legal. Smae reason Conrad Black who stole enough money to put you away for decades only got six years and didn't even serve it all because legally he didn't have to.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T17:54:25,1
Oh I’m totally on your side.,Lanko-TWB,2025-04-23T18:05:46,1
"Yeah, I don't know why people are upset with my take tbh like it's pretty clear the choice they were gonna make when fighting a foe with unlimited resources that gets to make the rules. it's not the right thing to do but if lawyers and judges did the right thing all the time then Trump, Bezos, Musk, Zuckerberg and Polosi would be in prison for crimes but that will never happen.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T18:13:48,1
"Extremely obvious. They should take ethics into account for sure but let’s be so for fucking real, they car about winning the case, making money, and playing the law is how they do it. Ethics have never been in question. Oath or not or whatever. It’s always been money.",Lanko-TWB,2025-04-23T18:16:38,2
"Exactly, they won't win anything here they will just be found not guilty and while that may give some redditors pride in hearing that's not worth alot to giant law firms versus just giving Trump and his friends free legal hours and settling privately.  This is normal for Trump, he use to refuse to pay builders and painters and let them sue him and he'd settle privately for less. Theres a famous paint of him by Ralph Wolf Cohen called ""The visionary"" but Trump and his wife tried to get out of paying him but Cohen smartly kept the painting till payment was done, he said ""Donald, I don't give away paintings"" because he was a legend in the art world. He also did it to Andy Warhol who painted Trump tower and again Trump refused to pay, it's a smart move if you are a moral-less scumbag.   Rich clients pay lawyers quite often to help them do unethical or illegal things, so this definitely doesn't hurt their client base either like these lawfirms were not ""No win, no fee"" type of firms.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T18:30:35,1
