"Judge Howell threw out Trumps entire EO   https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.184.0.pdf  > DECLARED that Executive Order 14230, 90 Fed. Reg. 11781 (Mar. 11, 2025), issued by the President on March 6, 2025, entitled “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,” is unlawful because it violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and is therefore **null and void**  >",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-02T18:42:22,83
"Excerpt of CBS's coverage of the story (no paywall):  >In a 102-page decision, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the firm and said Mr. Trump's directive that sought to punish it sent the message that ""lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.""  >""Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion,'"" Howell wrote.  >She found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.  >The decision from Howell, who sits on the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms that have been penalized by the president as a result of their associations with people and causes he disfavors. In addition to Perkins Coie, the firms Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey have also filed lawsuits challenging their respective executive orders.  >Perkins Coie represented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous ""Steele Dossier.""  >[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-law-firm-unconstitutional/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-law-firm-unconstitutional/)  Per MSNBC, over 200 lawsuits have been filed against the administration during its first 100 days:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbLJM-Vy\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbLJM-Vy_w)  It's fortunate that Trump remains as incompetent as he has always been.",I405CA,2025-05-02T18:36:12,37

"“No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit,” Howell wrote “targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.’”",M1Garrand,2025-05-02T23:04:57,4

This is a small win - eventually Trump is going to simply start ignoring judge's rulings and the Constitution (more than he already does).,justtakeapill,2025-05-02T18:44:26,10
