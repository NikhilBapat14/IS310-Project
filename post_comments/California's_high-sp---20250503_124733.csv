"man, this project has been a mess from the start. they really need to figure out the funding or its just gonna be another wasted opportunity. high speed rail could be good for California if they can get their act together.",HugsCatcher,2025-05-03T12:51:07,17
"Back in the 60s, America had the world's best infrastructure,  now they have one of the worst.  It's crazy how far the U.S. has fallen.",akd432,2025-05-03T13:18:04,13
"We waited too long to go for a new rail system. There was a point a couple decades ago that this could have worked out. Now with the political divide/apathy... And the sheer cost of this... It's going to die as a short rail system connecting Sacramento, Fresno, and Bakersfield. Oddly enough all very red cities.",williamgman,2025-05-03T13:20:55,7

There's a state job opening on the internet right now for a director position on this project that pays 20k a month. A fine example of why this costs so damn much and what do we have really to show for the countless billions we've spent so far.,chucklefits,2025-05-04T01:38:53,1
"See what happens when you don't tax billionaires, millionaires and corporations. You awesome stuff that helps people.   Like in Europe or Japan or even China",hobopopa,2025-05-03T20:50:34,0
It's absolutely not one of the worst. That's pretty hyperbolic. The US still has one of the best infrastructure ratings in the world.,Scarlettail,2025-05-03T14:07:59,8

"Also, established and maintained lines were often historically built on exploitive labor, and the surviving ones sold to freight companies. Now all the land is developed, the costs are astronomical as you say, and any chance for economical development has been cateted to highways over rail",Necessary-Analyst156,2025-05-03T13:55:28,3
I’ll be amazed if the bit between Bakersfield and Fresno gets completed. Been watching that barely move forward for some time now.,Silly-Victory8233,2025-05-04T08:35:06,2
Sacramento is not a red city. Not sure where you got that idea.,meTspysball,2025-05-03T19:11:09,4
What I meant was in comparison to Asia and Europe. Asia is light years ahead of America.,akd432,2025-05-03T14:22:26,1

They're stuck on the overpasses. They  started those first due to the complexity. But they will never connect Bakersfield to LA. That leaves but a small corridor of travel given the central valley's stats. Bakersfield is Trump country. Stockton went bankrupt several years ago. So maybe farm workers (who's not deported) commuting between fields?,williamgman,2025-05-04T11:22:28,1
Less than 60% turned out to vote. Registration is one thing. Showing up is another.,williamgman,2025-05-04T11:33:37,1
Depends where exactly. [This says US is 7th in the world in infrastructure.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/infrastructure-by-country#title),Scarlettail,2025-05-03T14:28:54,1
"That is a bullshit metric based on opaque scoring from the Institute for Management Development. Their focus is on freight transport, not passenger.",cubert73,2025-05-03T16:13:50,3
"The first thing they mention is transportation, and the US is great at freight.",atetuna,2025-05-03T14:54:01,4
"That list makes no sense at all. America has better infrastructure than China, Japan, South Korea, UAE, Qatar??? I mean c'mon.   I've been to alot of these countries. UAE's infrastructure is practically flawless.",akd432,2025-05-03T14:33:33,3
They are using freight as a measurement. I can get anything I want overnighted across the country except myself because flights are too expensive.,Smodphan,2025-05-03T18:18:45,3
