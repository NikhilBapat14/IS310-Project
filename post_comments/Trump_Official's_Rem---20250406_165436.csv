People voted for this clown again and a large chunk chose not to vote because how bad a Trump win would be.,meshreplacer,2025-04-06T19:50:55,30

These are the same people who didn't vote in 2015. It wasn't a tough decision and solely blaming a campaign is just silly.    The choice was simple and they chose to be contrarian.  Stop giving the Veruca Salts a pass for being selfish assholes.,soupinate44,2025-04-06T21:40:01,5
