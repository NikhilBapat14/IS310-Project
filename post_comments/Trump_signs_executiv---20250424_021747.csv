He literally can’t do that. It was signed by Congress. Congress has to undo it.,Low-Woodpecker-5171,2025-04-24T08:06:01,68
Civil War — here we come.  Hope Captain America shows up.  He’s not a racist.,Equivalent_Soil6761,2025-04-24T12:38:48,18
"I just think of the dumbest person I've even known in my entire life and imagine that person now being President.   ""That kid who got all Fs in school and never got a license because such a loser is now President...""",_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-04-24T14:02:33,11
So back to colored water fountains and bathrooms? Didn't he just say he wasn't racist? What kind of monsters vote for this?,blackie_4,2025-04-24T08:58:49,18
What else would you expect from the Russian asset?,Imaginary0Friend,2025-04-26T09:37:50,1
"There’s been a lot of “he literally can’t do that” being said since January.   Guess what? He’s trying. It’s up to the courts to rule against AND ENFORCE the Civil Rights Act. If they don’t, then it goes from trying to did.",annaleigh13,2025-04-24T11:41:46,40
"Roughly 95 percent of his EOs are unconstitutional in their entirety.  Nobody is doing a damned thing to stop that and they continue to be enforced, so….",Old_Baldi_Locks,2025-04-24T11:36:05,22
Who is going to stop him? He's been using EO for the past 100 days on stuff that he legally can't do with an EO and no one has stopped him,bluegumgum,2025-04-24T08:08:29,17
Has Congress achieved anything since 3rd January 2025.  They seem awfully quiet.,Dipso_Dave,2025-04-24T17:14:09,4
He can do anything if he simply ignores judges at this point. He has proven it again and again. He does not and will not follow the law.,Imaginary0Friend,2025-04-26T09:37:04,1
"Funny enough, the dumbest person I’ve ever met would probably still be better than this.",sethlovesyou,2025-04-24T18:22:46,9
That a the new anti Christian thing they got going on. I mean isn’t this unchristian?,brenawyn,2025-04-24T15:38:34,4
"I want people to put those signs up so i know who to not give my business to and who isn't welcomed in my home. If they cant treat black people the same way they'd treat me, i wont have shit to do with them.",Imaginary0Friend,2025-04-26T09:39:25,1
"Republicans lost their shit almost every time that Obama or Biden issued an EO.  I think they called it  “overreach of the Executive “.   Democrats are relatively quiet. Yes, the EOs are being challenged but where is the outrage.",ramapo66,2025-04-24T18:51:18,6
Agreed. It is all because each of the three branches of government are covered from head to toe in corruption which has lead to an intractable stalemate.   For Pete's sake. This administration has colluded with El Salvador to build something so nauseatingly evil no one that hasn't been affected by the corruption has not a clue how to end this international human rights nightmare that doesn't involve a lot figurative headbutting.,Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-25T09:20:22,1
"The point is he *can* do it, but it's meaningless and just another feather in his cap to his supporters.",VintageLV,2025-04-24T08:47:48,11
The courts have definitely stopped quite a lot and still are.,buffysmanycoats,2025-04-24T12:38:05,7
"I mean, when the last time you saw a Republican controlled Congress really do anything of value",Beer-Me,2025-04-24T17:34:08,3
Yeah the courts have tried to stop him but he's defying the court orders. Hence the aircraft didn't turn around and they are still deporting and refusing due process. He should have been arrested.,Tera-Wonder4276,2025-04-24T15:17:32,2
A good point but there's hardly any pushback from the Democratic party.  Is that just due to the sheer amount of rubbish produced by the trump regime's chaotic incompetence?,Dipso_Dave,2025-04-26T03:12:41,1
"After the Supreme Court ruling, they turned around a couple busses that were heading to the airport for deportation flights. The courts do have the ability to rein him in and they are trying.",buffysmanycoats,2025-04-24T18:30:22,2
