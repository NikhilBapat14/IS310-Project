Outside of being a C-suite at an F100, it’s exceptionally rare; and a 4-star would have zero chance of getting one of those roles.

"Know what, this deserves a serious answer, and I throught about it a bit more, so here goes:   They need a red line or two.    Republicans have long held their red lines - chief amongst them gun confiscation. It's been frequently articulated by Republicans that a large scale gun confiscation will result in Republicans going ballistic. As a result, they are effectively protected from such an action even when they hold no branches of government.   Dems need to say 'Trump shall not X' and communicate to the whole country that there will be general strikes and... well whatever Republicans like to threaten when they're a few drinks in... if that line is crossed. Dems rank and file are itching to take a stand but there's always the option of waiting until the next outrage.   That's the type of leadership we need. They need to find a red line or five. Real stuff that resonates, not stuff Trump is gonna do tomorrow but stuff he might do, get out in front of it. ""If you send the military to sanctuary cities, _it's on_.""

That's what you're not getting. You are watching the revolution the far-left has demanded for years happen, and like everyone was telling you, it would just end up giving the right more power.  For the last time and then I am done. The democrat have no power, beyond minor influence which they are using. All they can do right now, is redirect the far right flood that the American people voted into power. And do what little they can to minimize the damage, but there will still be a lot of damage and frankly a lot of dead people. That's it. That is all they can do.
