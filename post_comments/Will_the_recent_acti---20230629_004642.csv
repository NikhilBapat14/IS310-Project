"I doubt it.  It's been true for decades that Turkey doesn't get along so well with portions of the European section of the alliance, the recent actions are just a manifestation of that rather than a change.  It's still the case that all of them have a common strategic interest of defense against Russia which is the core of the basis for the alliance, and that concern tends to be far more important in geopolitics.  In Turkey's case it also seems that the objection is mostly done for local Turkish politics; one of the inherent difficulties of a large organization where everyone has veto power is that it gets very unwieldy and difficult.  Hungary doesn't matter all that much for NATO anyways, unlike Turkey, it doesn't control much of strategic importance.  Nor is Hungary's military all that relevant.",zlefin_actual,2023-07-01T08:41:26,1
