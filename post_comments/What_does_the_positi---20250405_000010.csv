"They did math on imports and exports, not tariff ratea but that is how they presented     The highest tariffs are for coumtries that export way more than they import... Small countries that cant afford american items     Bangladesh  Vietnam  Cambodia     USA and most G-10 type countries have reasonably balanced trade     China is really the big ome but that's alot of dollar store and walmart type stuff. America cant produce that stuff at anywhere near china's cost",Rivercitybruin,2025-04-05T03:02:21,14
St Pierre got hit with 50% because 1 company bought 1 shippment of fish from them last year.  Its a tiny fishing island that doesnt really trade with the US.  The fact that the US was worried about them is as laughfable as penguins... back to what we should be talking about....signalgate,D4UOntario,2025-04-05T07:07:48,7
It is just descending by trade deficit size *but* with Canada and Mexico removed and the EU considered as one country.

"Tariffs apply to almost all countries, except a few. Russia and Belarus did not get tariffs, while uninhabited islands did.  Russia and Belarus are special in Trump world.",billpalto,2025-04-05T08:11:48,3
"Given that they were slapping massive tariffs on uninhabited islands, I don't think you can pull much thought out of their actions beyond wanting to build an economic wall between the US and the world.",DKLancer,2025-04-05T10:06:56,1
"It doesn’t even make sense. I can’t fathom why they’d do it that way. Like even knowing they are doing everything in bad faith, like why plug every single country into that dumb formula and then specifically single out Russia, North Korea, etc?   Do they want to look the most guilty? Is it a power play that they want to see how blatantly they can get away with hating democracy and simping on Putin? … or are they just that incompetent, and simply do not care?  I’d give anything to see a closed doors meeting with Trump and his inner circle.",PrincessNakeyDance,2025-04-05T04:43:39,9
"> China is really the big ome but that's alot of dollar store and walmart type stuff. America cant produce that stuff at anywhere near china's cost   Try and explain that to the morons over at the conserv sub. They are mostly praising Mango's stupidity and saying ""we need to bring those jobs from China to here"" completely not understanding why they're in China. Dumbest mother fuckers alive and it's not even close.",I_like_baseball90,2025-04-10T16:14:20,1
The fact St Pierre is even on the list demonstrates that they just used some generic formula or AI. I doubt they even could find it on a map.  (It's just south of Newfoundland fwiw),aGuyNamedScrunchie,2025-04-07T12:12:12,1
"As a glib remark, I totally buy the idea they threw the whole prompt into an LLM and just ran with output.   On an unrelated note. When they are going to be asked again how they intend to replace the ACA, or social security whan that cracks ... they will use the same method.",DreamingMerc,2025-04-05T05:42:40,9
"This move makes EVERY company, industry and country have to come groveling to Trump. Trump gets to pick every winner and loser, and the grift for that would be off the charts. Basically he took hostage the entire world economy.",satyrday12,2025-04-05T10:03:01,6
"I'm going with incompetent. That's the attribute the voters and non voters prize most. They wanted a show and validation and boy are they getting it. It was always obvious maga was stupid from top to bottom, and that this was the explicit appeal.",RocketRelm,2025-04-05T06:16:17,3
"Yes.   It’s a shakedown.   They need to send the signal that if you play ball, are corrupt enough, you’ll win in Trump’s new world economy. The entire point is that Trump has taken our 401Ks hostage and using them to run a protection racket on our trade partners.  It’s a stickup. He’s out a gun to the head of the world economy and held the world hostage. The point is patrimonialism.",fox-mcleod,2025-04-09T06:36:15,1
"They almost definitely just used every code in the ISO-3166 international standard. Lots of territories get their own.  St. Pierre and Miquelon is an overseas dependency of France, but it has its own code (PM). As do Heard and Mcdonald Islands (HM) and British Indian Ocean Territory (IO), which are unpopulated, hence the memes about Trump putting tariffs on penguins.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:PM  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:HM  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:IO",ezrs158,2025-04-07T15:36:25,2
"I understand that aspect, by why do it so terribly that they look like corrupt idiots? Is that part of the play or are they just such corrupt idiots this is the best they can do?",PrincessNakeyDance,2025-04-05T14:02:50,2
"That’s the whole point.   If you don’t make it clear what you have to do to win, people don’t know to pay the protection racket. He needs to send the signal to *every* country *and* to every business.  Most people are still asking questions like, “what’s the end game?” Or speculating about how he can renegotiate trade deals. Countries are still fighting with retaliatory tariffs instead of just paying him billions in cash to get free. He’s going to make it more obvious he’s looking for bribes as the economy collapses around us and he starts shooting 401k hostages",fox-mcleod,2025-04-09T06:37:39,1
