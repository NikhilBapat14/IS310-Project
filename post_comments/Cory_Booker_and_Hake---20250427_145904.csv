"This ain’t it, fam. Cory needs to get all of the dem senators to do a 47-day filibuster rotation. Hakeem needs to either get with the m-f’ing program or hand party leadership in the House to AOC.   edited: spelling",sagan4dawin,2025-04-27T16:46:35,19
This is great. They need to get more people involved.,Silent_Section_6409,2025-04-28T07:54:19,2

"That's a good one. You are joking, right?  Do you think he can magically conjure all the other Dem senators? This is real life, not World of Warcraft. He is literally doing his part. Sit ins are one of the most effective forms of protest, even if it's just two people. Two people can motivate dozens of others to join them, or thousands of others to protest in other ways.",[deleted],2025-04-27T22:18:02,3
You can always do something other than talk down to what someone else is doing.  AOC hasn't even passed a law. She's not leadership.,Mynuszero,2025-04-27T18:57:55,3

And what are you doing to help draw attention to this?,Simpletruth2022,2025-04-27T17:21:19,15
People: Democrats need to do something!  Democrats: Does something   You: iT's NoT eNoUgH!,Mynuszero,2025-04-27T19:00:16,9
Maybe it’d be more effective if they all held up little signs with popsicle sticks.,sagan4dawin,2025-04-27T22:35:33,1
I’m not talking down to them - I’m shouting up at them. AOC has shown more leadership in the last 4 months than dem “leaders” have since 2016.,sagan4dawin,2025-04-27T19:32:01,7
"""Does something"" can be broadly interpreted. Throwing a middle finger as his passing motorcade is doing something. Proposing a bold new strategy that captures the public's attention, inspires millions, changes the dialogue, and creates a way forward is also doing something. I don't think it's out of bounds to call Hakeem's lazy low-effort low-energy sit in as ""not enough"". It ISN'T enough.",VariationAgreeable29,2025-04-28T10:44:09,1
