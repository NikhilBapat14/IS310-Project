"Set up your own damn methods. What are our taxes paying for at this point? Cutting every benefit and crowd sourcing stuff. Oh yeah, but we need to spend trillions on defense so we can attack Greenland. Got it.",lionofyhwh,2025-05-06T05:24:18,34
"To make it easier for Trump to locate undocumented immigrants, citizens who support him should get little microchips in their arms that can be scanned to verify them as legal.",30mil,2025-05-06T05:18:11,11
Customs and Border Protection has called for tech companies to pitch real-time face recognition technology that can capture everyone in a vehicle—not just those in the front seats.

Maybe pictures of people driving in expensive cars and limos around the capital and surrounding suburbs should be sent in,beadzy,2025-05-06T13:24:35,3
"They’ve been ramping up all kinds of surveillance lately. I get that it’s for security but it’s just kinda weird how normalized it’s getting. Next thing you know, there’ll be cameras everywhere at every crossing and nobody will even question it.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-06T05:29:56,5

"The Department of Transportation site says over 99 million people entered the US last year in vehicles. We’re going to take a picture of everybody in the car? And what are we going to do with the data? Who’s gonna pour through it to look for whatever they want to find? I swear to God, these guys just make this shit up.",mfeldmannRNE,2025-05-06T13:32:26,1
"I have the same thought. You know, when you get rid of all the good things about this country, from the postal service, to national parks, PBS with Sesame Street, making sure kids are fed etc. There's nothing left. What makes us better than any other country? Our freedom? Well judges are now being jailed, protesters deported, and American citizens can now be deported at the whim of Mr. Trump. Health care? Lol. After Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are done with this country, how will we be better than any other country?",citymousecountyhouse,2025-05-06T06:41:34,4
