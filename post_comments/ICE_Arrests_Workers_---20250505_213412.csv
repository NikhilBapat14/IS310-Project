When do we get to arrest ICE?,DrHob0,2025-05-05T21:39:53,21
First... Most of those fuck heads working for ICE are not formally trained. They are Meal Team Six graduates. It's time for them to learn about consequences to ignoring The Constitution: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_naItk8Egc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_naItk8Egc),williamgman,2025-05-06T00:52:42,2

"It looks like the government, through ICE, is taking on the role of the Pinkertons in the 19th and early 20th centuries by surveilling and suppressing labor movements and workers.",Hrmbee,2025-05-06T12:44:35,1

I don't normally like to post vids about this in more than a few places. Comes off as spam. But this message is where we should be at going forward. Yes... They may not be coming for some of us... But they didn't in 1930's Germany either: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_naItk8Egc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_naItk8Egc),williamgman,2025-05-06T00:55:12,4
What do you suggest should happen?    No one has a plan of action. All we have is talk. AOC talks. Bernie talks. I've been to seven protests now and we have speakers at these protests and people write stuff on signs and wave them around. But words written on placards are just printed talk.    I've yet to see any serious leader announce any plan of action and offer to lead it.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T22:23:33,-1

"This right here. Most of the ""agents"" being hired recently have little training. Wait till they find out folks like us on the left of the road... carry too. You better have some fucking ID.",williamgman,2025-05-06T00:57:16,4

"you need people to go on mass strikes, stop paying taxes, block roads, shutdown utilities. this takes a lot of brave folks and that doesn't group of people doesn't' exist yet and may never exist. Your political leaders have their own agenda and they're not going to lead you down a road that will be anything, but as you correctly pointed out, writing stuff on signs and waving them around.",Flying_Woodchuck,2025-05-05T23:04:00,6

"Yet they've been going after people with work permits, student visas, protection orders, and active court dates. Even snatching them from their court appointments. US citizens have been detained by them. Pretty obvious they don't care about status if they're targeting labor organizers too.   They're an evil agency that deserves only condemnation and a stay at the Hague.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-05T22:45:36,14

There's no historical examples of those techniques toppling an oppressive regime without strong leadership and organization.      We don't have that here so I expect the fascists will consolidate their power over the next year and that we're cooked.   But when I say stuff like that people here on Reddit/Politics call me a doomer and a MAGA troll.    Lotsa people here still can't handle the truth.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-06T07:09:58,3
"Our taxes are being used to illegally round up people, forcefully shave them, fly them to a foreign country with no due process, and then to pay for their life imprisonment.   I think we should ALL collectively as a country refuse to pay taxes. Immediately change our W2 status to not with hold. Make it big. Spread it everywhere. Some of the protest groups have 200k plus members. Over 5 million people showed up to the April 5th protest across the country. If 5 million or more people did this all on the same day and announced a refusal to pay taxes until the current administration is held accountable for their constitutional violations. Maybe that would make an impact. We are reaching a point that continuing to pay taxes is stupid because that money will be used to suppress us.  If the current administration continues, I’ll probably be picked up on a list at some point. Might as well not give them my money to do it.",Used-Yogurtcloset757,2025-05-06T09:17:37,2
