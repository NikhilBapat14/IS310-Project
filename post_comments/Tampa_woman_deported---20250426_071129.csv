">“The baby is distressed and does not want to eat,” Valle said. “Imagine, they ripped the child from her mother’s arms at the immigration office; the cries of that woman in there could be heard back in Cuba,” he said, speaking of his wife’s desperation at being separated from her daughter.  This is why I don't support deportations of undocumented immigrants unless they are actually committing violent crimes (and there has to be due process to prove it, of course). The deportation of harmless people like this accomplishes nothing and causes trauma for family members. Whenever you deport someone, you rip them away from their family and community, so that causes harm to many people, not just the deported person.  The whole story is incredibly heartbreaking. And if you read all the details, you'll notice that ICE went to great lengths to deport her very quickly so that her lawyers had no chance to fight back. This is a pattern in all these detention and deportation stories that have come out lately: ICE tries to move fast to deport people, then once they're out of the country, they say ""Too late.""  Also, notice that she was detained **while attending her required ICE check-in.** That's another common pattern. People are being punished for doing the right thing and showing up to their check-ins!! This just incentivizes people to not show up for check-ins, although then they'll get in trouble for that too.",sachiprecious,2025-04-26T08:58:33,249

"Machismo or the appearance of being ""manly"" is a factor.   However, Latinos are not monolithic, some comes from conservative cultures or came from corrupt authoritarian regimes that use the communist or socialist name and are heavily traumatized and spread that demonization of ""communist"" and ""socialist"" to future generations on top of the GOP successfully labeling anything the Democratic party does as ""communist"" or ""socialist"".   Another point people are missing many Spanish speaking media channels (radio, TV, social media, newspapers, TikTok) has been successfully co-opted by the right-wing media or right-wing billionaires or podcasters. This is true for many non-English channels throughout the US. The Democratic party or left leaning people in this country didn't capitalize or engage with Latinos as much as they should or could have.   The Democratic party and left-leaning activists lost the messaging war in a battle they were already from a losing position from. Many of such voters tend to value facts (to an extent) and thus Democratic party has to use truth to fight against lies but we know that lies can go halfway around the world before the truth can even get their boots on. It is easier and less energy to bullshit your way through than it is to back up your statements with actual research and facts. And do you manage to successfully refute one lie you have to fight another fifty lies. It is a tough battle and the average voter, especially a voter in the United States doesn't have the attention span or patience to go through it all. ",Ipokeyoumuch,2025-04-26T16:00:14,7

So when those people flee to the US, and they hear Bernie sanders talking about socialism, it scares them. However, the issue is that they improperly conflate socialism or wanting to implement safety nets as the “cause” of their country of origin’s collapse/corruption, rather than the fact that an autocrat is going to be corrupt, regardless of what political system they’re pretending to forward. Plus, they’re tough on crime bc they have often seen bad violence in their country of origin where the gov was unwilling to help, but they just don’t fully understand that Republican racism toward Latinos often doesn’t turn on immigration status but rather race, with little ability to distinguish besides white (good) and not white (bad).",WookieMonsta,2025-04-26T10:56:29,110

"No, I'm sorry, that's simply inaccurate. What you are talking about is ""returns"". That's people who recently crossed the border who are sent back. What I'm talking about is ""removals"", which is typically people who are found by CBP/ICE and sent out of the US after living here for more than a few weeks.  An average of 150k people per year were *removed*  by the Obama administration from the ""interior"" of the US, meaning more than 100 miles from the border. Many of which were done without due process. The BCP and ICE agents were given the leeway to play judge and jury. And when hearings before judges *were* scheduled, immigrants were often not notified or tricked by ICE into missing those hearings, and then removed on account of not showing up to court. If they did make it to court, they rarely had legal representation.   The Obama administration made a point of focusing on criminals, but in the first Obama administration, only half of the removals had criminal records. By the end of his second term, that number had increased to about 85%. Obama tried to make immigration policy more fair thru DACA, and that's why we don't associate him with these things.

"You sum it up nicely. I grew up in south florida and am Puerto Rican.   so many of them dreamt of the day of castro’s regime falling and they returning to reclaim there house or business they left behind. With no thought to the people who were left behind living in those places or running those businesses. And that they would get back everything.   Then they spend decades idiotically talking that democrats are going to make this country a socialist or communist country. Never mind the drastic reality that our democrats at the time were nothing remotely like their Cuban government. And let’s be real, Cuba is an authoritarian government. Republicans have been more aligned to that democrats ever were.   That said. May they continue to get everything they vocally endorsed.   I’ve no sympathy for magats.",catsloveart,2025-04-27T10:36:25,3
"Many years ago (1979) I spent the summer traveling Europe on a student based program. Among my group were a brother/sister pair from Miami, Cuban ancestry. Their parents had escaped Fidel (they would spit his name out like a cuss word) They were the biggest ladder-pullers I'd ever met. The family had been hugely successful here in the import/export business and while they were fun and nice to be around, their wealth was obvious, as was their contempt towards many of minority status. They were rabid Republicans and spent a lot of time talking about how Nixon was done dirty by 'clueless Americans'",dietcokeonly,2025-04-27T18:14:20,2

I get that but in the context of the post it’s important because you may not see yourself as something but THEY may see you differently. Here I am wondering how far back on lineage they’re willing to go!,wicked_lion,2025-04-26T16:41:59,0
"It is absolutely not right. And I'm definitely not implying that it is by saying it was happening under Obama. I'm just saying we have to be truthful about what is unprecedented and what is existing problems, so we can keep our perspective. It may not be new to deport people without due process, but it is certainly new to have a President who seems to revel in the pain he causes. And it is new to have factions of society that now feel empowered to openly say they hate people of color and want them to die, even the children.  It's like the ground under our feet has shifted and no longer feels solid because we can no longer assume the best in our fellow countrymen and humans.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-26T16:42:32,2
