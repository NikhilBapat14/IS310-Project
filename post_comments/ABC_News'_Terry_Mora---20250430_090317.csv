"""You're the president, you can reach over and pick up the phone,""  THIS! Thank you, Terry! I'm glad he pushed back but sadly Trump's cult followers will agree with him and say that he ""wasn't being nice.""  And I'm so tired of hearing Trump complain about Biden.

""Why aren't you following the directive of the SCOTUS to bring him back right now, today?""  Was he worried about fallout from his employer?  Were there concerns that DJ would come after ABC like they did with CBS?  So what?    The ABC article on their website is woefully underreporting the interactions between these two - no real deep discussion on this portion, and fluffy bits about other portions.    The reporters across the spectrum need to push back harder.",AXPendergast,2025-04-30T10:09:06,23

"Here's what I see. The photoshop job was an obvious fake. Anyone with moderate skill could have sold it as plausible, but they didn't even bother. No one who looks at the picture honestly believes it is real.   It is, therefore, a loyalty test. If you show someone a picture that could be real, and you say it's real, and they agree it's real, you have learned nothing about their loyalty. If you show someone an obvious fake, and you tell them it's real...if they also say it's real then you know they are loyal to you and will say whatever you want them to.",The_B_Wolf,2025-04-30T11:25:02,2
