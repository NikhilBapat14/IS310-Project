Vance converted to Catholicism as an adult. He chose the religion. One of the major tenants of the faith for Catholics is that the Pope is the literal emissary of God on the Earth. He chose this faith.  The Pope warned him against persecuting migrants.    JD Vance wouldn’t even share that message and will actively ignore it. How awful is that?,TheDebateMatters,2025-04-22T12:26:45,72
"And that is why Vance took him out using a dermal poison that looks like a band-aid, it transmitted the untraceable time released toxin directly to the Popes blood upon shaking hands. ",therapistofcats,2025-04-22T09:25:22,125
"Pope: ""Your hearts are filled with hate, and you both suck.  ✌️ I'm out.""",CelticSith,2025-04-22T12:42:50,29
"Vance is a ""Catholic"" who supports and promotes the death penalty in his official capacity in power. That's enough to make him contemptible in the eyes of the Church.",mowotlarx,2025-04-22T12:42:48,23
"JD needed to get put in his place regarding Catholicism. He’s an adult convert to the faith and still has a lot to learn about it. You may be enthusiastic about your new found faith, but you don’t know a thing about it. That’s just my perspective as someone baptized as an infant & went to Catholic school. I learned a lot about my religion, JD still has to.   Ultimately I hope the man did learn something positive from his visit to the Vatican. Pope Francis is a pretty damn fine person to emulate & learn from regarding simply trying to be a good human. That I being said my hopes aren’t high.",LookLikeUpToMe,2025-04-22T13:36:55,8
"The breath of fresh air wasn’t the fact that he was sneaking out while as pope to help people suffering? It wasn’t when he wrapped baby Jesus in a keffiye and called Palestinians in Gaza every single day until he died? It wasn’t when he rejected the golden throne of the papacy and resided close to the people? It does feel very…I don’t even know the word, but him discipline Vance does feel good, there’s something fulfilling about him telling Vance that if he doesn’t behave himself he’s not going to have to worry about making it to church every Sunday and vespers in the week, because there won’t be enough he could in his short life to make up for his sins.",AppalachanKommie,2025-04-22T14:45:16,7
Pope Francis was right.  Any real christian despises what Trump and Vance are doing.  It's just not christian!!!,Troubled202,2025-04-22T15:03:22,6

">The Pope warned him against persecuting migrants.  Not just that, but *God* warned him too.  >You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.  Leviticus 19:34.  According to the Bible - supposedly the book Vance believes in - this is a command from God given to the faithful. You cannot hate the stranger, ignore the pope and still be a good Christian.",BCMakoto,2025-04-22T20:07:49,12

"Depends. As someone who was raised Catholic and went to catholic school for about 15 years; the main voter issue Catholics care about above all others is abortion. Point blank and period.   As long as republicans are pro-life, they will generally be the party backed by the Catholic Church at-large.",Whiskeywiskerbiscuit,2025-04-22T20:11:53,0
"So true. I’m 61 and have been a convert for 30 years now. It’s work and commitment to be a practicing Catholic and it never ends. Masses (and not just Sunday), practicing all sacraments, prayer life and on and on. It’s a complex yet very beautiful religion that simply asks of us to love one another and to serve the least amongst us. If you think on that last part, opportunity for that are endless and can be very tiring.  Joe Biden was a practicing Catholic.   The Pope telling off Vance and Trump in his Feb letter to US Bishops on immigration, and then recently to Vance’s face and then his follow-up worldwide message, is pretty grave. Especially a humble, people’s Pope such as Francis. This alone would scare the Hell out of me. Then he died. His last official words as Pope is admonishing the United States.",TrixnTim,2025-04-22T16:32:16,8
