"Don’t ever let them convince you that wholesome shit like Elmo and Mr. Rogers are dangerous or radical. This is basic stuff like “sharing is good” and “do unto others”. The right wing war on empathy continues to claim casualties. I would say it’s banal, but they do it for control.",Static-Stair-58,2025-05-02T11:43:58,17
"In which anything that is not sycophantically praising Trump is left-wing, woke propaganda.  Just SOOOO many parallels to 1930's Germany.",LargeWu,2025-05-02T11:43:40,7
Woke is anything other than MAGA to these people. That includes everything from Dick Cheney leftward.,BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T11:46:37,5
"Somebody correct me if I am wrong, but NPR doesn’t rely on a lot federal funding.  Not like the state run propaganda outlet that whitehouse.gov has become.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-02T11:48:01,5
"Go back to slashing taxpayer funds for farmer's, veterans, etc. You know, the people that voted for it.   Another instance of Not My President right here.",thistimelineisweird,2025-05-02T11:48:47,4
"Slashing its budget, if it ultimately succeeds, will not put them out of circulation. This is not the first time. Decades ago, they went against certain animal charters that kids enjoyed watching.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-02T11:49:43,4
"Q: What is radical woke propaganda?  A: empathy, compassion, acceptance, kindness, inclusiveness, love  You know, all that stuff that Jesus hated.",thesirensoftitans,2025-05-02T12:12:55,3
"NPR only gets like 1% of its funding from the federal government. PBS is more (I want to say 20%, but that could be completely wrong), but I'm sure they'll make it up elsewhere. All this does is tell people that Republicans are against ""woke"" ideas like ""facts are real and important"" and ""being kind to people makes the world a better place."" (Not that their opposition to those things was a secret.)",Hotel_Oblivion,2025-05-02T12:09:01,3
"The CPB, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was appropriated $535 million for FY 2025 from Congress. No more than 5% is allowed for CPB administrative expenses. About 70% is allocated to more than 1,400 locally owned radio and TV stations. Each station receives a combination of funding from federal funding, foundations, and support from viewers.   It was created by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968 it was registered as a nonprofit corporation in DC. It originally collaborated with the National Education Television (NET) but due to controversy generated by conservatives, it went into talks with private entities in 1969 to form PBS. NPR would be created in 1970, a network of public radio stations.   It has a 9-member board of directors, each to serve 6-year terms. Each member is appointed by the POTUS and confirmed by the Senate. A POTUS may not appoint more than 5 members from the same political party.   The lawsuit against the Trump administration (copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_for_Public_Broadcasting)):  On April 28, 2025, the CPB filed a lawsuit against the second Trump administration after President Donald Trump attempted to fire three of the five members of the CPB's board of directors. On May 1, Trump issued an executive order directing the CPB and all federal agencies to end funding for PBS and NPR.",krozarEQ,2025-05-02T12:27:34,1

Truth and reality are Trump’s enemies. As such he should be the enemy of every American regardless of immigration status or tax bracket.,Electromotivation,2025-05-02T13:00:57,2
NPR I believe is donation based but PBS gets about 15% of funding from the federal government,Hey_HaveAGreatDay,2025-05-02T12:11:45,3
