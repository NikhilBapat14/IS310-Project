"He just ""trolled"" Catholics with an AI image of him as the pope and then said they can't take a joke.   He IS anti-Christian bias personified.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-08T08:10:49,42

If people can walk up to your door....any day of the week....ring the doorbell numerous times....knock incessantly....and then leave pamphlets on your door if you don't answer..for the sole reason of spreading Christian religion...without you EVER asking for them to come by....  ....then Christians should feel a lot safer then other marginalized groups these days.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-08T08:17:32,6
"Please call this what it is!       This is a religious inquisition.   Entertain this thought: Anti-semitism is purposely conflated with the Israeli government. Judaism is unique because it is a religion and an ethnicity. So, they claim that if you are against the Israeli government, you are anti-Semitic, which is false.   Imagine Trump's government claiming that if you are against his government, you are anti-Christian. That's where they're headed.",_Last_Primate,2025-05-08T08:24:24,6

"I do have a anti-christian bias. you can't have freedom 'of' religion without first having freedom 'from' religion. religion has no place in public schools and statehouses. religion has no place in courthouses. religion has no place in the mouths of elected officials.  convince someone to believe absurdities and it becomes easy to convince them to commit atrocities.  christian youth indoctrination creates masses that accept on faith not evidence, adhere to strict social hierarchies and conform to strict norms, they are groomed to seek a savior strongman, and everyone outside their in-group is evil, wicked, damned -- that is how you spread hate. that is how someone like trump was elected.  religion is a cancer on humanity.",Virbillion,2025-05-08T08:55:02,6

Religious belief should be labeled as a mental illness. To suspend your belief in facts for faith in an imaginary being is just like a schizophrenic talking to imaginary beings in their minds.,NorCal_commie,2025-05-08T11:51:09,1

"I'm not biased against people demonstrating any brand of religiousness.  For it to be bias it requires the judgement to be unfair or unreasoned.    It's not unfair or unreasoned to want nothing to do with open and extreme religious people.  I treat them exactly the same way I'd treat an adult that still believes in the tooth fairy and goes around telling everyone they meet about it.  As in they will be recommended for mental help, not a job opening.",Richfor3,2025-05-08T09:04:09,3
Presumably because you've had previous bad experiences with people who are religious or at least have been taught to beware of them. That's how negative biases develop.,thrawtes,2025-05-08T08:16:34,-2

"I can't argue against that, except to say that Christianity, from the beginning, is not a monolith. I for one cannot give up my faith because this yahoo and his grifting cohorts havea co-opted it for their own gain.  My proof? I can take almost everything this guy says, does tweets or gestures and show how that is not ""the way of Christ"" Christian lives should elevate the needs of others above our personal desires, practice foreberance and forgiveness, embody true charity ( ancient Greek agape love) and expect nothing in return.   What do I do with the undisputed fact that 95% of the observed behavior of Christians in America today contradict this behavior? I try to practice those principles above with them as well.    I could also substitute Wall Street firms and ""gurus"" , not for profits, corporate media, the two party system, multiple lawyers and law firnd and judges and many ,many other individuals , systems and institutions have failed to stand up for the people that they are bound to protect.
