I dunno were you asleep the last quarter century?   Do you not remember the jingoism around Iraq and post-9/11? The Ground Zero Mosque?   The republican candidate during the campaign in 2016 (whatever happened to that guy?) pledged to ban every single Muslim from entering the country for an unspecified period of time.,UnfairCrab960,2025-05-07T20:43:41,60
"Only because Republicans push them away. This has historically been the case for Jewish people and Catholics as well.  All of these groups are more recent immigrants to America compared to Protestant Christians, and so were discriminated against.  For example when Irish and Italian Catholics first came to the US they faced heavy discrimination because they were seen as different. Most of them started off in manual labor industries which pushed them towards left wing economic ideas like labor unions. Now that they are more integrated into American society, they have begun moving right.  We also have a recent new wave of Democrat Catholics in the form of Latin Americans. They also did not receive a warm welcome from Republicans so they went to the Democrats. The same phenomenon happens for many immigrant groups, with notable exception for immigrants fleeing communist countries who are already disillusioned with left wing economics.  The religions themselves aren’t more progressive. The people just initially lean towards Democrats as a reactionary response because they were not welcomed by Republicans.",Alert-Algae-6674,2025-05-07T20:58:00,12
">If this were to change—and I acknowledge this is a broad generalization—I believe the GOP would attract a significant portion of the Muslim vote.   ""If the scorpion were to change its nature, it would get lots of convenient rides from frogs.""",parentheticalobject,2025-05-07T20:56:48,17
"The Islamophobia is a feature, not a bug.  The GOP uses it to pull in more evangelical conservatives and people concerned with Islam diluting America, whatever that means.  Islam represents about 1.7% of the total us population, to gain that they'd lose the racists...   So they are unlikely to modify that position any time in the near future.  Check out the Democrats and their pro-trans stance as another reason why the GOP is going to remain anti-islam.  Being pro-trans pulls in all of the trans vote effectively... but mathematically it is a net loss for the dems because a number of moderates who would otherwise vote democratic don't vote or even vote for the GOP.    Basically the GOP's positions are to maintain enough votes to get elected, adding Islamic voters would cost them and they'd have to pull from elsewhere and those votes traditionally go democratic.  Right now things are in play though, but I doubt Islam is ever considered a low enough hanging fruit that the GOP moves that direction.  Not that they couldn't modify a few positions, but because there are so few Islamic voters that it will never be worth what it costs them.",tosser1579,2025-05-07T20:46:17,16
"While it’s true that many Muslims hold conservative social values, political alignment is often shaped by more than just personal morality—it’s also about how a community is treated and represented.  For many Muslim Americans, the perception (and, for some, direct experience) of Islamophobia from certain voices in the GOP has been a major turnoff. Policies like the “Muslim ban,” rhetoric painting Islam as a threat, and lack of representation have left a mark. Even if some Republican principles align with Islamic values, it’s hard to support a party that appears to view your faith or background with suspicion.  At the same time, many Muslims also care deeply about issues like healthcare, social justice, immigration, and civil rights—all of which have been more central to Democratic platforms in recent years. These factors often outweigh disagreements on things like LGBTQ rights or abortion.  That said, political affiliations aren’t static. If the GOP made a concerted effort to reject anti-Muslim rhetoric and focus on shared values—like strong family structures, religious freedom, and small business support—I could absolutely see more Muslims leaning right.",FIalt619,2025-05-07T20:52:16,9
Its the same for many evangelical black voters or any other conservative religious group that isn't majority anglo whites - the Republicans have been outwardly hostile to them to the point of making their own identity out of it.  Its a strength of the Republican party that they aren't made up of so many different constituencies that often have differing priorities and agendas - they are 90% white evangelical Christians. Truly if Republicans could get over their own racist tendencies they could make huge inroads with core parts of the Dem coalition but that would mean ostracizing their own base of white racists.,olcrazypete,2025-05-07T21:17:34,3

I think it is that most hard core Democrats are practicing their faith while Republicans are pretending theirs. It does not help that Trump abandoned the Kurds in Syria last time.  People have long memories of weasels.,Curious_Cactus9794,2025-05-08T18:09:07,1
"If most Republicans could get rid of Muslims most of them would— to them this is a white Christian-Nationalist Anglo-Saxon country. They also started the Afghanistan and Iraq war which went on for decades. Republicans are most for racial profiling (and profiling Muslims), they have NO representation of Muslims in the party.",paganpoetbluelagoon,2025-05-09T20:43:49,1
Kinda hard to ally yourself with people who vilify you. Though there most certainly are a non-insignificant amount of Republican Muslims,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-05-07T21:17:04,1
"I am a Muslim it’s a mixed camp I can’t lie. lots of Muslims or older Muslim generations are still in support of social conservatism, I agree many of us support progressive values on economics and rooting out corrupt no duh, we are mandated to donate our wealth and look out for one of another.   The GOP was actually making pretty good inroads with the community with the culture wars I can’t lie, but once Oct7th and election pasted many went back to hating Trump again.   The reason why many Muslims didn’t turn out to vote or even voted for Trump or left the top blank (probably voted blue down ballot) was cause of Gaza. Plus it’s why many still hesitate on the GOP on how open they are about their Islamicphobia",yasinburak15,2025-05-07T21:09:48,0
"Because leftists/Democrats' ""kindness"" are seen as weak and gullible. Easy marks to take advantage of and turn into political puppets and mouthpieces. They'll back anything as long as it directly opposes the right. Even if they don't believe in a topic, you can easily play up their white guilt and make them submit or shut them up by accusing them of -isms and -phobes. The left also controls the major news outlets which shields the crimes of Islam (like blaming ""Asians"" for Muslim rape/pedo gangs in Europe).",RawrGeeBe,2025-05-08T17:54:26,-2
For better or worse this is the most direct answer.      When the terrorists made their faith central to their actions it ensured it would be generations before the nationalist leaning party of the country they attacked would embrace those of the same faith with any degree of sincerity or comfort.,Mrgoodtrips64,2025-05-08T14:57:52,1
"The GOP doesn't need to court Muslim voters. They know two important things; 1. A great many of their voters are bigots and would not stand for that kind of thing, might actually stay home. 2. As long as the Democrats run a woman for President, those Muslim voters will largely vote Republican, as they did in the 2024 Presidential election, For Islamic religious fundamentalists, oppressing women in more important than fighting the bigotry they face in American culture.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-05-08T08:30:55,2

"How did it go over when Trump started talking about ethnically cleansing Gaza and turning it into a resort?  I know it's presumptuous of me, but I would guess that more than one person in Michigan must have deeply regretted their vote (or non vote).",ColossusOfChoads,2025-05-08T02:49:50,2
"It didn't have to ensure that. The nationalist could stop being ignorant. They could recognize that someone being a radical does not indict every group that they happen to be a part of.    Honestly, way more blame for the mistreatment of Muslims falls on right-wing media like Fox News then actually on even the terrorists. Because there were a few dozen terrorists who pulled off attacks in America, but there is a huge multi-billion dollar organization devoted to making Americans hateful.",rzelln,2025-05-09T10:11:28,3
