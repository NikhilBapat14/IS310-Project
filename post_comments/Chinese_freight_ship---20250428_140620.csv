As much as a 75% drop is what I've heard through the grapevine. 50-something per week turning into 50-somethijg per month.  Empty shelves as early as late May.,QaraKha,2025-04-28T14:15:14,28
"MAGA Focus group getting summer survey questions ready RN:  *Recent news reports show empty store shelves, severe stock market declines, surging inflation / interest rates / debt delinquency, decreased economic activity and increased unemployment.

"How come every time Trump is in office, we have to deal with a toilet paper shortage? Is it because he's so full of shit the rest of us have to suffer the consequences?",Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T17:44:47,6
"My republican-leaning sister was posting how the port of Seattle is eeriely empty. My other (hardcore Republican) sister lives in a tiny town a few hours away where cheap goods at Walmart is a huge part of her life. The angst and panic is a little palpable, surely leapords would never eat *my* face!",HoleSearchingJourney,2025-04-28T20:25:34,5
"Cut all discretionary spending and learn to be as frugal as possible.    I never go out except for free events, and I've personally been increasing my pantry stores loading up on foods that'll hold well (canned, pickles, dried goods, noodles, spices).   I expect to see a lot more people struggling economically. I just saw 25% of Americans used ""buy now pay later"" services like klarna for groceries in the past year, and I've noticed a huge increase in the unhoused in my city over last year.   There's people living out of a minivan in my neighborhood. They ain't drug users and don't cause trouble so I have helped them with food when I can.  As prices increase and recession/depression/crash I'm unsure if I can help those unfortunate folks as before.  Weirds one way to put it!",maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-28T15:16:04,20
"I watched gamers nexus news piece on the tarrifs affecting the computer industry, and all those interviewed said the same thing--  they stopped importing to America with the tarrifs.  It's coming from the horses mouth, folks.  It's gonna be bad!",maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-28T15:20:02,16

Almost all the toilet paper we use is manufactured here. There are tariff impacts on the materials they use to make the toilet paper though.,trogdor1234,2025-04-29T02:44:02,1
