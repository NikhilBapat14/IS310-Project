He was preoccupied with the social-media platform X, which he’d previously admitted had been a major “accelerant” of his depression. He drove his car so “recklessly,” Jentleson said, that staff refused to ride with him. He had also bought a gun. “He says he has a biometric safe and takes all the necessary precautions, and living where he does I understand the desire for personal protection,” Jentleson wrote, referring to Fetterman’s rough-and-tumble town of Braddock, Pennsylvania. “But this is one of the things you said to flag, so I am flagging.”  He sounds like Trump, minus the shit neighborhood and hoodies",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-02T10:39:00,895

">Less than a month later, Fetterman caught a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles after taping an episode of Bill Maher’s show. His staff urged him to have someone pick him up from the airport and drive him home, but he refused. Just before 8 a.m., according to a police report, Fetterman was traveling at “well over” the 70-mph speed limit on I-70 when he smashed his Chevy Traverse into the back of a 62-year-old woman’s Impala, totaling both cars. Gisele, who had been in the back seat, suffered a pulmonary contusion and spinal fractures. Fetterman, calling from the side of the road, told a staffer he had fallen asleep at the wheel and handed the phone to a police officer.  >“It’s a miracle no one died,” the officer said.  I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I caused my fiance such a serious injury... This is terrible. How can he think any of this is ok? He needs to resign and get help. It's obvious that his recovery plan is incompatible with the stresses and demands of his job as a senator.  >Fetterman went on to make statements that shocked people.

"Yeah, it's pretty clear that Fetterman has suffered a personality change since his stroke. It's well known and understood that certain types of brain damage are associated with negative personality changes, including increases in aggression, black-and-white thinking, etc.  Hell, it's affected politics before. It's probably why Woodrow Wilson changed his mind about punishing Germany after WW1. He arrived in Europe looking to be conciliatory, but caught a bad bout of the Spanish Flu, and when he recovered he was suddenly much more aggressive and punitive in his stance toward Germany.",Logical_Hare,2025-05-02T11:05:33,58

"> In our conversation, Fetterman downplayed any supposed arguments with Gisele, telling me that she “has her own voice” and that he would never try to change her views, even if they differed from his. “I think that’s very common in political marriage,” he said. In a statement, Gisele suggested Jentleson was part of a conspiracy to damage her husband’s reputation, saying Jentleson fed her “scary, untrue stories about John’s health.” She added, “I would talk to John’s doctors about what Adam was telling me and they would be confused. Those doctors would tell me that their concerns were not with John, but with Adam. Any alleged ‘concerns’ heard from me came straight from those lies, not from John’s doctors or my own eyes.” In response, Jentleson said, “I stand by everything I said, and I hope Senator Fetterman gets the help he needs.”  At this point, Gisele was empathetically texting with Adam about the condition of her husband, then just suddenly turns on him?

"I have seen patients get like this when they have been put on a class of medications called dopamine agonists. Mirapex, ropinirole. They are used for various neurological problems, but doctors, including psychiatrists, sometimes use them for depression.     What is a marked problem with these drugs, is that they make the person be very different from they way they were previously. So family members, friends, and coworkers state: He is like a totally different person. With different values, etc. Often not able to understand their effect on others. They can do emotionally hurtful things especially to people close to them. At times, almost manic. Often the doctor can't see it, because they didn't know the person before. If this is the case, the best thing to do is stop these dopamine agonists quickly. After about 2 months, people close to them will see them going back to how they used to be. The patient usually has no insight regarding this. They think they are fine, and everyone else has a problem.",Newswatchtiki,2025-05-02T18:21:41,2

"This one is both fascinating and heartbreaking.  We are seeing in real-time an individual who either A: promoted themselves one way to get votes with the intention of acting another way. (An oldie but a goodie in American Politics see manchin, sinemma, etc etc) B: solely goes off of local political sentiment meaning he will basically just go whichever way the wind blows and say that was his duty to his constituents. (Also a very popular strat in America) C: was a legitimate progressive that was approachable to the moderates and the more blue collar folk and then shorted out after a stroke and became very conservative...  I personally believe it was a combo of A and B... but it really doesn't matter because he is going to be shit on either way and his stroke will be the center of the conversation.  It sucks.

"why would you need briefings when you can read 8 sources?   Like with Israel and Gaza. I've been paying attention to this for 20 years. The kids who were watching Farfour on Tomorrow's Pioneers 20 years ago on Palestinian public television were murdering people at a music festival on October 7th. I can go online and look at CIA population stats. I can read a history book. So, I know there is no way Palestine is going to take over Israel for another 30 years, if ever, and that it just a stupid pipe dream by Neo-Nazi-esque Palestinian nationalists. And while the deaths in Gaza are a horrible thing, they aren't the same thing as the holocaust. They're not even at the level of the 4th week of the Battle of Berlin during ww2, which is a comparable event because of the size of the area and the population of the place. I'd rather not live in a hyper reality constructed by political actors and live in my own informed reality.   I can just imagine if WW2 took place in our information age how there would be German immigrants in America posting pictures of dead German children from Berlin on twitter trying to get the world to stop fighting the Nazis, ignoring the fact that the place is ran by racist nationalist party that's goals are to expand it's territories trying to restore some mythical Camelot from times of yore from about 80 years ago.

"This is honestly something I worry a lot about. I look at Trump supporters and think, “I could never be like that,” but I would have said the same thing about my grandmother prior to her opioid overdose in 2013.   Typical sad opioid addiction story: elderly woman prescribed oxys after back surgery in 2009, spends years on the stuff and no one thinks twice because they’re prescribed by a doctor and “only young hillbillies are addicts” and not nice old grandmas. Goes too far one night, is luckily found in time by my aunt, spends a week in the ICU, and eventually goes home.   But as far as I’m concerned, the woman who used to babysit me all summer and taught me to sew and bake pecan pie and angel food cake died that night in October 2013. She was different from the moment they took the breathing tube out and she could talk again. She was just mean and angry at even the most trivial things.  The husk of a person who physically survives is obsessed with chemtrails and 5G. She’s gone all in on almost every QAnon conspiracy.

(As opposed to congressmen, who do represent the mob in a way, but only have two year terms.)  I don’t actually know whether a people can vote “no confidence” on a senator, or have them impeached. I don’t understand the rules on that level.   But the government is not a private company, and being a US Senator is not just “any other job,” which means the same rules don’t apply here.

"Once you start doing certain things for a while it gets to be a habit. That habit can be a lot stronger when it directly affects brain chemistry. The internet is replete with stories of people trying heroin, meth, or cocaine just once or twice to see what it’s like. And then several years after hard work they are finally sober again.  For years I’ve gradually reduced my drinking to perhaps a few beers a week. Over the last few years I’ve wanted to reduce it further. That’s has been surprisingly difficult.

"One of my obsessive questions is: would I be able to tell if I went insane? One can imagine ways to try and see it — e.g., have a few people you know you should definitely be able to trust (ideally if they are independent of one another and would not be able to coordinate against you), constant ""self-checking"" of ideas and thoughts (e.g., both logically and through some basic research, and generally being aware of the kinds of ideas that might signal such a thing (e.g. paranoia, meglomania, euphoria, etc.). I have a very powerful ""super-ego"" (in Freud's terminology), and am pretty self-aware of my mental states (good and bad), so I like to think that I might be able to figure it out.  But, then again, there are so many people who clearly can't tell, including intelligent and self-reflective people, so that isn't a good sign. What are the odds I am better at this than most people who go insane? Low, I have to acknowlege.  Furthermore: I have ""tells"" in my dreams that signal to me that I might be in a dream, and when those happen while I am dreaming I run through an ""am I dreaming?"" line of logic. Depressingly, even with that ""prompt,"" I only can tell I am dreaming maybe 20% of the time. The rest of the time after running through it I conclude, ""nope, this is real,"" even if (after waking up) the dream's premise was obviously and blatantly ridiculous (like my having joined the circus or something). Which I interpret as an indication that the parts of my brain that can do real logic are obviously not being fully engaged when I dream (it is clear my ""dreaming self"" only has access to some of my mental faculties and not others), and that if I were going insane there is a good chance it would either be disengaged or complicit in the insanity. Sigh.  I have a friend who suffered a brain injury and while he has largely recovered, his personality has changed in at least one way, which is that his impulse control has been reduced. This has led him (I have been told) to do things like stop his car in traffic and get out and yell at other drivers — stuff he would _never_ have done before. Apparently he does not realize what he is doing is out of character (and dangerous, etc.). Now when I get annoyed at someone in traffic I think about this — would I be able to resist such impulses and urges? Again, I'd like to believe I could — because I like to believe in my own rationality — but in reality I have my doubts, in part because I already have evidence of urges I find almost impossible to resist despite my rational self knowing they are a bad idea (like eating a late night snack; much more harmless, fortunately).",restricteddata,2025-05-02T17:46:17,1
"You are. We all are.  I had a grandfather who took some very serious brain damage in very horrific fashion. Not gonna go into it. Can't. Won't. Would have worked until the day he died, and out of pleasure, not necessity, that man. It breaks my heart still to think of his last years robbed of that. It's actually given me some trauma that I didn't realize I had for many years, watching him decline.   And also my grandmother, his wife. I mean I was just their grandkiddo. She watched him go off to WWII and come back alive, and raised a family with him, raised grandkiddos, and... her loss was just so fucking... real. So much so that I wonder if the Alzheimer's that eventually set in might have been a fucking mercy for her. I can't imagine her pain. To watch them both fade away like that... yeah enough of that.

Unfreeze the numbers in the House and adjust electoral boundaries to create approximately equal population districts;   - Federal electoral laws. Create a Federal Electoral Agency to administer the same laws across the whole country;   - Direct election of the President. The Electoral College is excess baggage;   - Preferential voting. Make sure the least unliked person wins;   - Compulsory voting. Think of it as a huge jury;   - House term of 4 years, rotating over two year cycles.

Actually yes. Long term unchecked mental illness does start to cause genuine long term brain damage over time. ESPECIALLY severe depression and psychosis since parts of your brain stop receiving a proper amount of signals and start to decay. It’s not often talked about in mental health circles since mental illness is treated as something purely cognitive and people love to talk about ‘personal responsibility’ but mental illnesses can have a genuine neurological impact and cause permanent long term biological impairment that WILL affect how you behave and perceive things. It’s why treating them is so important.  Edit: though I agree that creating laws around who is considered mentally fit enough for office will backfire and harm people who don’t deserve it.

"Funnily enough, my back problems actually mellowed me out a little. I was a very angry person. I was angry about so many things I couldn’t control in the world and it made me depressed. Once I became disabled and completely unable to move my left leg due to a herniated disc, I no longer had the mental energy to be upset about anything other than the fact I couldn’t move and the unbelievable pain I was in 24/7. Post-surgery my surgeon literally told me “That was in the top 5 worst I’ve ever seen. If it makes you feel any better, you’ve quite literally experienced the most pain the human body can feel.”   It reframed so many things for me. I still have the same fundamental worldview, but I got much better at compartmentalizing things and even though I still deal with complications and pain years after my surgery that allowed me to walk again, I’m a happier person than I was.

"Not disagreeing with you. But Dr. Oz fits that same level of fraud.   Perhaps it’s just a matter of perspective, but Oz always struck me as an incredibly obvious conman. I saw that long before I even started following politics. So it doesn’t surprise me that many people recognized that about Oz while getting tricked by Fetterman.",Peroovian,2025-05-03T12:21:27,1

"Well, when they say 'improvement' I think they mean more like personality-wise. They may have impaired cognitive abilities or whatever. But them becoming kinder really couldn't be marked down as either an impairment or improvement as far as actual brain function is concerned without like... Understanding exactly *why* it happened and each case would be different. I have heard of that exact thing happening. I don't know how prevalent it is however.   Maybe some part of their brain was fucking up signals between like... Language centers and emotional regulation so they get angry a lot, stroke breaks that particular part of the brain, the brain reroutes around it and boom. That particular thing is working more or less like it should for the first time. This is heavily simplified, but the basis stands.",CarpeMofo,2025-05-02T21:43:58,3
"See, I worry about having a stroke and becoming like... A dumb, hateful bigot. Because, I don't know what makes me me. Then I have to ask the question if I did have a stroke and it changed my personality and made me a better person... Would I still be me? It's easy to outright reject a worse version of me. A better version gives me pause though. I really just don't know.",CarpeMofo,2025-05-02T21:46:39,1

Oh my God man yes. The sneezes were horrific. I vividly remember laying in bed one night and sneezing. It literally felt like a bullet went through my ankle and I started screaming. It was unbelievable. I’m so sorry you went through that.,RandyMuscle,2025-05-02T17:21:18,3

I appreciate that this has been a civil discourse (as far as Reddit goes lol) but I do disagree with you. I feel that Fetterman is at least a magnitude above Oz in terms of con-man-ness. Exemplified even more so by his recent actions.,snowplow9,2025-05-03T13:29:06,1

"Maybe, idk. There was a lot of accepting old me is gone.  I may have a different personality. Not a radical switch. Definitely some differences that I perceive.  You can't shift back into old brain and compare differences. That is not written to sound like a dick. Just part of recovering is realizing the old you is gone and new brain is different.",crit_boy,2025-05-02T15:53:42,43
"I think if you were an aggressive person a TBI could mellow you out if it targeted your emotional centre.   Bit I agree with what you said, any ‘improvement’ to personality is likely still due to damage in an area and would maybe come with other symptoms that aren’t behaviour related.   But damage to emotional centres usually has negative consequences not positive ones. Positive outcomes would likely be a lot rarer since TBI’s are more likely to cause mood swings",OvercookedBobaTea,2025-05-02T22:31:14,3

"If you don't mind answering questions... So, lets say pre-injury, you love Star Trek and hate Star Wars. Then the injury happens, you discover you now love Star Wars but hate Star Trek. Can you remember at one time being like ""I like Star Trek because it's hopeful and hate Star Wars because everything is dirty."" even though now it's ""I like Star Wars because it feels lived in and hate Star Trek because it's too earnest."" and understanding the logic behind your original stance?
