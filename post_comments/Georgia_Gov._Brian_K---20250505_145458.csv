Kemp was the most likely person who could unseat Ossoff. He and the rest of the Senate Dems just breathed a giant sigh of relief.,DragonPup,2025-05-05T15:20:25,13
"Absolute game changer. While it's not a guaranteed win for Ossoff, it's going to be a challenge to beat him now. If Warnock could win in what should've been a red wave year (2022), what should be a blue wave year will hit even harder with Trump's economic impact. Ossoff can win, and so can Warnock win *another* full term in 2028.  If it wasn't obvious, Dems need to defend these key seats, yes - especially also Michigan, which went red in 2024. But they also need to expand their pool. I've seen emails saying they're only targeting NC and Maine. They gotta think bigger and expand to Alaska (Alaska keeps hitting back at MAGA in favor of moderates, and Dan Sullivan is MAGA; Tom Begich III or Mary Peltola could win that seat, while whichever doesn't run for that one can win back at the at-large seat from Nick Begich). Let's not waste time on other nonsense (I keep seeing Tennessee and such in the mix); of course, run people, but let's not be dumb. Of course, run Sherrod Brown for the Ohio special and run Jon Tester for the Montana special. We can make bigger gains than Dems seemed to be resigned to think we're capable of.",alabasterskim,2025-05-05T15:39:48,8
Kemp knows this is a blue wave election incoming and doesn’t want the stink of defeat on him.,TarheelFr06,2025-05-05T16:32:16,6

"If Kemp doesn't run? Ill still say toss up and that Osoff is still most vulnerable even if someone like MTG runs   But if Kemp did run I would've said lean R so still a huge upgrade    I wonder why, maybe he's eyeing a 2028 presidential run",blues111,2025-05-05T15:35:02,0
Unfortunately this means the wretched Marjorie Taylor Green will run for that seat. Hope Ossoff blows her out of the water,Adorable-Constant294,2025-05-05T16:26:57,0
Huge for the Dems in general.,unfunnyryan,2025-05-05T14:58:18,25
Or they know Trump will disband the Senate soon. ,Blablablaballs,2025-05-05T14:57:55,7
"Warnock was close against a broken, bad candidate. Kemp would wallop Warnock in 2028, so that or straight to the presidency is his likely play.",wehooper4,2025-05-05T18:04:44,3
Has to be running for president as a Mitt Romney-like alternative to Trumpism/Vance,Braves10516,2025-05-05T17:45:38,4
Kemp has had. 60% approval rating in Georgia.   The only reason he wouldn’t run is if their internal polling data for mid terms was just incredibly bad and he doesn’t want that on his brand. ,aaprillaman,2025-05-05T19:31:33,2
"He isn’t interested in being a Senator. Warnock would be even harder to beat than Ossoff given the huge black turnout he drives, and the fact he’s never lost an election here. Ever.  Kemp is looking for something bigger. Maybe a presidential run in 2028.",LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T15:19:31,2
"Latest poll from the AJC has Ossoff with commanding leads against all GOP challengers except Kemp.  MTG? He leads by 17%  John King (Current Insurance Commissioner), Ossoff by 13%  Brad Raffensberger? Ossoff leads by 9%.  This was the GOP’s best and only hope for this seat.",LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T16:06:27,1
That’s not unfortunate. Greene wouldn’t win a statewide election.   If anything it means she loses her house seat. ,aaprillaman,2025-05-05T19:32:27,3

The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,ClashM,2025-05-05T15:04:17,17
Or Kemp wants nothing to do with the shit show that will be having to run while Trump is speed running fucking up the country.   Kemp is definitely not done with politics. He'll run at some point,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-05T21:21:59,1

"He's definitely going for the presidency.   But my point about 2022 was that he did that during a red wave. 2026 is not a red wave year. There's not really anyone who's polling well, even when you factor in name recognition and undecideds.",alabasterskim,2025-05-05T18:07:53,1
"> The only reason he wouldn’t run is if their internal polling data for mid terms was just incredibly bad and he doesn’t want that on his brand.   That or he wants to run for POTUS in 2028. No point in running for Senate when you have a good chance of losing, and even if you win and want to run for POTUS you'd have to keep fundraising and piss off the people who voted for you thinking you'd stay in the Senate for at least two plus years.",I-Might-Be-Something,2025-05-06T01:22:43,2
"> Maybe a presidential run in 2028.  Assuming MAGA doesn't still hate him after 2020 and he can win a primary, he'd be a strong GOP presidential candidate",DragonPup,2025-05-05T15:22:42,3
"I disagree, Warnock would be much easier for him than Ossoff. Warnock may have never lost, but it was pretty damn close against Hershel fucking Walker.  But yeah he may be aiming to go higher.",wehooper4,2025-05-05T18:20:06,1

"You people have no idea why that was the case.  1. It was a midterm year that should have been awful for Democrats. He still won, when every other GOP candidate also won.  2. Most people not from here don’t know how big Walker is because of his football career. That’s it.  You really have no idea what you’re talking about.",LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T18:37:20,0
That too but with Vance as VP I imagine he'd have to wait to be the nominee therefore it would make sense to maybe try for the Senate post trump,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-06T10:58:09,1
