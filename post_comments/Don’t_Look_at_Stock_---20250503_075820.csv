"Logistics manager here, dealing primarily with imports. Two of our three biggest retailers have changed operations in what was otherwise normal business. One has cut direct import orders by 50%. The other has reduced import orders and changed freight terms from FOB (they pay customs) to DDP (we pay customs) for their orders.   On top of that, our normal FCL imports to our 3PLs for domestic order fulfillment are delayed 2-3 weeks at origin due to an increase of blank sailings.  This is more worrisome. May is typically the start of peak season where companies like the one I work for start shipping stock from China to the US for the holidays.

Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges.

Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong.

Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was.

"China's beyond sick of Trump's shit.   One thing I've noticed is that their statements are often pretty bombastic when they're unhappy about something, but lately they've been pretty terse. Just ""no, we are not in active negotiations so stop claiming we are"" kind of thing. It feels like a pivot to ""no, this time we're legit pissed.""  Which will be a huge problem for Trump. Usually what happens is he does something stupid, people get upset, he doubles down, the actual consequences kick in, he can't take the heat, so he reverses his decision and declares victory.   But the oceans are big (container ship travel times I saw were 30 days to LA, 55 to NYC), and big retailers have tried to get themselves a little bit of a buffer. Plus, it'll start on the west coast, which east coast media tends to ignore.   So by the time the empty-shelf problems start to land for him, it'll be several weeks before containers could possibly arriving from China again even if we got to a deal immediately. And China is unlikely to make it easy on him, because why on earth would they? The US is being ridiculous \*and\* China holds most of the cards.",gringledoom,2025-05-03T11:14:08,40

Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effort so far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.  Voting in Trump once was a fuck up. Twice is a commitment. The rest of world is busy doing other things and doesn't have time for Republican bullshit.    China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random.

If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

While this view is optimistic about global growth of renewables, heat pumps and EVs, it also indicates a slower and dirtier path for the U.S. >  > Bond argues that since most countries do not have plentiful oil and gas within their borders, they need to import it and have confidence in the stability of supply and pricing. As that confidence erodes, they will look to alternatives. >  > Most countries do not have substantial solar panel, wind turbine or battery production, so reliance on those resources would also require imports. But the difference compared to fossil fuels is that a shipment of solar panels, for example, can provide benefits for 30 years. The buyer isn’t signing up for dependence on daily shipments of fuel. >  > This isn’t some fanciful theory. China already has a set of renewable energy policies that look a lot like what Bond is describing, as does the European Union. >  > The key theme here is “security.” I’ve been noticing the frequency of that word in energy discussions ever since reading a research note last month from Jeff Currie, chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, an investment firm. >  > “Security is now paramount,” he wrote. “The energy transformation is on the cusp of reaccelerating.

">USA's whole plan to keep China down is to make China the new scary bogeyman. It's easy propaganda  There is a timeline where the US succeeds in this long enough for China's demographic crisis to hobble them, allowing America to remain the dominant economic and military power of the world.  We're not in that timeline. Putin benefits more in the short term, but in the long term, China won the lottery with Trump.",Ut_Prosim,2025-05-03T18:33:15,1

">Europe is not in a trade war with China.  So what? You think USA cares at all about that?    >What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers.  What this means is supply chain disruption for Europe. I guarantee you that there is at least one European company that will be affected by this. Especially any of them that sell product in USA.

">I should have been clearer  That's why I asked. What you call a trade war is just the most recent escalation of a cold war that has been going on for years.   China is prepared for this ""trade war"" to go on for years. Trump didn't think it would go on this long. It's not a trade war. It's USA pushing the question to the world, ""Align with USA or align with China.""  It's not a trade war. It's extortion for protection money. China doesn't have to pay. Japan doesn't have to pay. China does not have to out last USA or Trump or Republicans. Neither does Japan.
