">non-nuclear hydrogen bomb  Ugh.  Hydrogen bomb means nuclear fusion.  The article is adwalled, but I can read something about it being very hot, and something about magnesium.  So it's just a chemical explosive ... ? Why mention that it's non-nuclear? That's obvious. What a dumb article.",Infidel42,2025-04-20T19:13:50,23
