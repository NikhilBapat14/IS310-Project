"I mean, we have succession plans at work for when people are unexpectedly out of office for a couple days. And we actually plan most things pretty badly (so they're not necessarily *good* succession plans, but they're there...)",builttopostthis6,2025-04-07T17:59:45,1
What's weird is bringing it up now. If I was a conspiracy theorist I would think JD Vance is building a succession plan for Trump.,No_Anxiety285,2025-04-07T18:17:37,1
"Funny you mention it - during his first term, Trump's staff refused to participate in crisis simulations.  These are exercises where senior staffers are prepared for situations where they have to make critical decisions in a short amount of time.  It can also inform departments on where resources need to be allocated to ensure that supplies & infrastructure exist to meet the needs for these scenarios.  One of the scenarios that was routinely practiced was a global pandemic.  Good thing that never came up.",cerevant,2025-04-07T18:00:40,1

"I mean, the United States literally has a pretty well-defined general [Presidential succession plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession) in place.

I always hate to blame on malicious intent what could clearly be defined by ignora...oh who the fuck am I kidding?",builttopostthis6,2025-04-07T18:04:42,1
Not when President Bartlett was in surgery. We were just kind of winging it.,IWorkForDickJones,2025-04-07T18:13:57,1
"Just like Trump 1, when Fox would find random Democratic officials or Obama Administration stories to run to distract their viewers during bad news cycles, Fox during Trump 2 is doing the same thing with the Biden Administration.   It’s also worth pointing out that the swearing in of the President is purely ceremonial.  Either at noon on January 20th or when the incumbent President vacates the office, the President-elect or Vice President instantly becomes the President.  There’s no buffer there while waiting for the new President to be sworn in.",ScotTheDuck,2025-04-07T18:07:48,1
"As an aside, was watching the episode of King of the Hill last night where Bobby does his presidential essay on Martin Sheen. Staying relevant, fifteen years on! \^\^  Fox actually cancelled that show to make room for The Cleveland Show. Not the best track record on judgement calls, Fox, on much of anything really, come to think, news or entertainment side... :/",builttopostthis6,2025-04-07T18:21:01,1
