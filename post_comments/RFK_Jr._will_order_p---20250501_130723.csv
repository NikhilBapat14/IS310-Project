The idiot is repeating the tuskegee syphillis experiment…….. which is literally the example used in medical ethics of an exceptionally shameful example of how healthcare can go against its own hippocratic oaths if allowed to; and for those that are not aware it was a study in the south where black men were told their syphillis was being treated and then given placebos to study the longterm damage of syphillis,Fun-Rice-9438,2025-05-01T13:41:45,45

Why would you need to do this again for well-researched diseases like polio and measles? The flu vaccine folks get every year? Delaying treatment just means potentially more body bags or worse health effects.,BigDaddyBain,2025-05-01T13:30:17,92
"Not every vaccine is placebo controlled. For example, if a known good vaccine already exists, it's often considered unethical to require the control group to use a placebo, since you'd be exposing them to a potentially harmful disease. Instead, the control group uses the existing standard. This is a way to test new and potentially improved versions of vaccines.  Then there are diseases where the vaccine has to be updated regularly. The flu shot being the most well known example. There simply isn't time to formulate the vaccine for the upcoming flu season, do a full placebo controlled test, then manufacture and distribute. Since the annual changes are minor and the process behind the vaccine is well understood, such vaccines are often allowed to use a simplified, faster process to get approved.",Rannasha,2025-05-01T13:34:56,84
"Oh easy. Because the man ordering this is not a doctor, researcher, scientist, or expert in anything except being rich and having a VERY old law degree.

He also doesn't believe in germ theory, believes vaccines cause autism, and cell phones cause tumors.   So you and everyone else that supports him, should go live in the fucking middle ages with miasmic theory and let the rest of society progress while you all suffer easily preventable illnesses and buy into miracle tonics.",Youcantshakeme,2025-05-01T16:57:04,25

"Well, there is the term placebo as we may use it colloquially (""inert sugar tablet"") vs clinical studies (as I am describing it). RFKj wants the former - a saline injection as the colloquial placebo.   The intent being he wants to discredit vaccines as an entire category - IE vaccines = root cause of problems, no matter what. He does not want to stand on the shoulders of giants, per se - the rigors of prior clinical trials that included, at one time, studies that used saline as a placebo because a SoC did not exist.  Modern vaccine clinical studies almost always use ""superior to SoC"" as a primary endpoint for clinical studies, and placebo is the term of art used. Unless the indication is brand new, no one ever starts from zero - the body of existing knowledge is too big to rehash that fight.   The issue is going to be what is RFKj's motivation for doing what he is doing, against the body of knowledge we have built over decades.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T15:58:25,10

"Yup, that was what I was getting at. But also in my experience seeing cancer drug clinical trial designs, standard-of-care is how it is always defined and I hadn’t seen anyone use it interchangeably with “placebo”. Maybe it is in news articles for a wider audience, but that’s where my confusion stemmed from.   If RFK Jr was using it interchangeably, I wouldn’t be surprised since he has no medical background, but I also believe he just wants less people to get vaccines so I don’t doubt he would demand clinical trials test against saline injection actual placebo.",JadedFault702,2025-05-01T16:09:06,3
"Like, does this guy work \*for\* the viruses now?  All this will do is create pockets of non-immunity for various diseases to fester.

"This is for vaccine testing, though, not like broad application.  Let's not fear-monger.  It's not that you'll go to get your flu shot and they'll give you saline instead.  It's that new vaccines will be tested against ""no vaccine"" where they may previously have been tested against ""current vaccine"".  So, imagine we somehow needed a new polio vaccine.  We would test it against the current vaccine to see if it's better, because the polio vaccine is effective and widely available to the vast majority of people.  The alternative is we find people without polio immunization, give some of them the new vaccine and others nothing, and then *expose them to polio*.  Odds are pretty good that the people without the vaccine are going to get polio and become critically ill (possibly with lifelong resulting disabilities) or die.  If there is no current vaccine then it's easy.  You're comparing the vaccine to what is already available - nothing.  If there is a current vaccine but it's not available to a demographic (because of cost or other factors), or it's only minimally effective, that's also fairly easy to justify because they're unlikely to have the benefits of a vaccine.  They effectively have ""no current vaccine"".  It's when you get to the level of ""there is a current vaccine and it's both effective and accessible to a huge number of people"" that it becomes sticky because you're essentially denying some people existing, available treatment to measure efficacy.",strangr_legnd_martyr,2025-05-01T14:15:02,-6
"> We would test it against the current vaccine to see if it's better, because the polio vaccine is effective and widely available to the vast majority of people.   We would test a vaccine *expected to be better based on all the data and development of it* on people who signed up to trial it.  The other vaccine exists in the wild, so we already have data on its efficacy.   At no point would we do placebo testing.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-01T21:44:39,1
