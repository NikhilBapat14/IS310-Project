"Good. Parents need to be charged for any crimes committed by their underaged children. It is our responsibility as parents to make sure our children do not commit crimes, especially heinous crimes like this.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-09T15:56:35,26
">*The father told investigators that following the divorce, his daughter started cutting herself so badly that he had to lock up all the knives in his home.*  Also:  >*bought the Sig Sauer pistol for Christmas in 2023, when she would have been just 14 years old.*  She had the combo to the safe, dad expressed concern about her access, but didn't bother to change the combo. On the Left hand, preventing access could have de-escalated motivation, on the other hand, it sounds like she had a dark connection to other, sharp weapons. It would be a nasty attack on the 2A if he got slammed, considering it was likely some kind of meds that stimulated her behavior. No, divorce-stress plus firearm access does not alone result in this happening.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-09T12:43:58,20
"The father was clearly irresponsible, and I'm not opposed to charging parents in some truly egregious cases, but I don't see enough here. Maybe there'll be something more  egregious that comes out, but not changing the code on the safe, even where you know your child is mentally unwell, isn't quite enough for me",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-09T13:06:05,16
"I’ve been saying the same thing for years. It’s baffling and infuriating when some kid causes something so disgusting and horrible but why aren’t the parents held and charged? I’ve not once heard of an incident where the perpetrator was feral and lived in the woods raised by wolves. So why aren’t the parents charged? I am from Chicago and say the exact same thing about all the underage carjackers, robbers, violent assaulters and such…when I mention the parents/guardians being charged for their 14 year old being on the Red Line at 3:30am robbing people I just get crickets.",Capital_Connection67,2025-05-09T17:25:20,8
"Giving a kid the code to the gun safe is pretty irresponsible especially if that child is already committing self harm. If they have free access at all time to firearms what’s the real difference in that and handing it to them. I believe everyone should have as many guns, clips, ammunition, suppressors they want but you should also be 100% responsible for every weapon you own.",Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-09T15:54:11,29
"Tbh I'm not nearly as pro 2A when it comes to houses with kids in them.  We've already accepted that there are certain duties that come with having children, and if you can't keep your kids safe then give up custody.    You got a house full of adults?  Have all the guns you want.  Adolescents are the ones going on shooting sprees though.",hiricinee,2025-05-09T18:39:21,-5
The article makes it seem like they bonded over guns. It sounds like he was hoping sharing a hobby with her might have been beneficial to her mental health.  Hindsight is 20/20 here.,Vektor0,2025-05-09T16:41:18,-5
I don't think hindsight is the problem. I think not being able to rationally understand your child has severe mental illnesses and choosing to not compensate for that is the problem. Gun or knives should have never been in the house.,erbaker,2025-05-09T17:55:26,12
