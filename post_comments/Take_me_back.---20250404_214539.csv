Hopefully with impeachments maybe. Trumpanomics is just Trump and cronies shorting the economy and giving kickbacks to Vladimir the pimp.,bigjaymizzle,2025-04-04T21:53:58,12

"Honestly, Bidenomics were not bad, they led to very good economic growth in for businesses and stocks. The Tech industry boomed under him.  What did him under was 2 facts.  1. Unfortunately, most Americans do not own stocks.   2. Most Americans want *improvement* to their lives, not maintaining the status quo. Inflation hikes and wages barely keeping up doesn't mean much if you were already paycheck to paycheck. I guess now your paycheck to paycheck.   If the status quo was good, Biden could've won, but it hasn't been good for decades. Whether thats the DNC and GOP's fault for not being able to reign in rampant greed, or just a natural bi-product of capitalism is another question  I don't know if there were any policies he could've implemented with the congress he had to significantly changed the microeconomics of the average person, making things like groceries, cars, and rent cheaper.",Naticbee,2025-04-05T00:30:50,14

The people I work with all voted for Trump...we are in mfg.  I am convinced if they watched real news sources (they all watch Fox and Newsmax) they would have also voted for Biden given his actual policies and the real state of the economy over his term in office.,GG1817,2025-04-05T06:31:19,2

While he was far far better then Trump let's not forget that he still made some fairly large mistakes like not rolling back all of Trumps tarrifs and continuing to pump money into MAGA communities.,N0b0me,2025-04-05T13:40:36,1

"If it's not possible to improve the lives of the average person, and  hoping that macro improvements will make their way down to the micro level, then genuinely, the people who are voting against the status quo may have a valid reason to do so.
