"Just to elaborate and confirm. Saying inflation is at 2.5% doesn't mean like things only cost 2.5% more than they did 4 years ago. It means that just in this year stuff costs 2.5% more.    2021 inflation 4.7%             something $10 now costs $10.47   2022 inflation 8 %                $10.47 item now costs $11.27   2023 inflation 4.1%             $11.27 item now costs $11.68   2024 inflation 2.5%             $11.68 item now costs $11.93   So this is like a 19% overall price increase in 4 years?      2017 inflation 2.13%        something $10 now costs $10.21   2018 inflation 2.44%        something $10.21 now costs $10.45   2019 inflation 1.81%        something $10.45 now costs $10.63   2020 inflation 1.23%        something $10.63 now costs $10.76   So this is like a 7.6% overall increase in 4 years?      2016 inflation 1.26%   2015 inflation 0.12 % <---- WOW!  looks like inflation in 2009 was -0.36% which was the only recent negative inflation I saw in the US recently. Probably from the real estate crash in 2008.   There has been world inflation as well it's not just a US thing but that's also not an excuse.

"Inflation is cumulative. 2.5% today is FAR more damaging than 2.5% 4 years ago.  10.00 + 2.5% = 10.25, not bad right?  EXCEPT  From 2000 to 2016 it averaged around 2, with a couple years of negative inflation.   10.00 in 2000 = 13.94 in 2016, for a change of about 40%  10.00 in 2016 = 10.78 in 2020, 8%  10,00 in 2020 = 12.18 in 2024, 22%  Now we return to look at 10.00 in 2000 to capture multiple administrations  10.00 in 2000 = 13.94 in 2016  13.94 in 2020 = 15.03  13.94 in 2024 = 18.31  Trump removed 8% of purchasing power via inflation during his time, and Biden removed 22%, or nearly 3x.  Real wages are definitely up, though those stats are skewed really heavily by the lowest earners and the highest earners - the middle class hasn't seen nearly the increase the outliers have, but write large our purchasing power is down significantly - largely because you can discount real wages at the lowest level (minimum wage increases) because they actually help drive inflation more.   It's far more nuanced than Trump is wealthy, the numbers show the majority of people had more purchasing power under Trump, even though the economy is better under Biden.",Wolfbeerd,2024-10-29T11:39:21,1

">I just make my judgments on what I see around me to be causing problems. Inflation, immigration, high costs of housing. High costs of groceries. High energy costs.   All of this can be traced back to having a worldwide pandemic more than policies from the current administration.    The high gas prices has a lot more to do with Trump than this current admin too.  You can look it up.  Trump made a deal with the Saudis for them to end their price war with Russia in 2020 and cut their supply to drive oil prices up, because the lack of demand and ability to trade on the global market was hurting our domestic oil companies.  But when demand came back following the pandemic, the Saudis didn't ramp production back up, which led to a shortage, which drove prices way up.  This is despite the US leading the world in oil production, as we broke a record for most oil produced while Biden was in office.  We're also net suppliers of energy.  But big oil companies have also posted record profits that outpace the rate of inflation, which is an indicator of price gouging.    Housing is high because building materials are more expensive (this has some to do with pandemic, some to do with Trump's tariffs with Canada and some to do with additional tariffs with Canada from the Biden admin), and big corporations are buying as much housing as they can to create rental properties or just to have them as an asset, which creates a shortage in supply, which drives the price up.    Price gouging has as much to do with high grocery prices as anything.  That's just Capitalism at work.  A lot of these companies took advantage of the pandemic to raise prices under the guise of ""supply chain"" issues and high fuel prices long after neither of those things were a major problem.    When you say you make judgments on what you see around you, you're just assuming that the change in president in 2020 is the reason behind the problems you see.  Conservative media has taken advantage of knowing so many people will make the same judgments, even though facts don't back up the reasoning for them.  It's a major problem, and it's devastating to think that we could be seeing the catalyst that ends this country as we know it.

This isn't all of a sudden.  We've not been building enough houses since the housing market collapse of 2008.  COVID intensified this, thanks to labor and material shortages.  We've also seen an influx of hedge funds and other investors buying homes to try to turn a profit renting them.  Air BnB has caused a problem of individuals buying housing as an investment as well.  You want to blame it all on immigration, but there are about the same number of illegal immigrants in this country right now as there was in 2008.     >They have an effect, and if you think it is zero, you don‚Äôt understand economics, on even a most basic level.  I have no comment, I just wanted to highlight this.",lordshocktart,2024-10-30T03:44:30,1
"Inflation was global. The spending under Biden is spread out over the next decade genius. trump dump it (tax cuts, wrong thing to do) and the rescue plan (the right thing to do) all at once, then we ran into a supply chain shortage due to the pandemic. No one was working. No one was producing anything like market saturation levels - meanwhile everyone had money because of the stimulus  and tax cuts. So inflation as a rate started ticking up.  The FED then forced us the bitter bill with interest rate hikes to kill inflation.",iguesssoppl,2024-10-20T19:41:31,6
"Per your link:  >Over Trump‚Äôs entire term, including the 2020 spate of emergency COVID spending, the debt increased by $7.7 trillion‚Äîa staggering total, to be sure.  It goes on to say that some of that was put into a reserve, so the number is closer to 6.5 trillion.  Even if that's true, you're basically making the argument that adding 6.5 trillion to the debt caused no inflation, but adding, I think your link said ~8 trillion caused this incredible amount of inflation we've seen.  That doesn't make sense.  You would have seen a pretty big jump in inflation during the Trump years if government spending is the main driver.  It would have been less under Trump than Biden if your link is correct, but not by much.    Explain to me why you think government spending has been the main driver of inflation.  How does excessive spending cause the price of cereal or natural gas to increase?",lordshocktart,2024-10-18T22:44:52,4
