“Offered 1500 to smuggle the child but did not take it”  Oh well my bad miss here’s the key to the fucking city,Vcheck1,2025-05-02T22:09:54,20
"CORRECTION: This title should say, ""*Mexican citizen attempting to enter the United States illegally also tried to smuggle her child across the border while drugged by using a fake birth certificate.*""",chrismireya,2025-05-03T00:04:44,1
Absolutely disgusting behavior only encouraged by birthright citizenship.  The only countries that do this to this day are the north and south americas’s which put it into law because of slavery.  It’s beyond time to discard these laws as we did slavery long ago,BattleIllustrious680,2025-05-03T08:47:40,7
