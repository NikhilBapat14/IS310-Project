"The adoption process is a mess in the US, fostering is even worse. It's a quagmire of paperwork for a lot of money that could potentially leave all parties involved with nothing at the end of it.  It favors babies over children, white/high-functioning children over POC/special needs children, and paperwork over sanity...  As someone who was once a foster parent and no longer participates in that world, I appreciate the Fostering/Adoptive families out there that can manage the mess immensely.

"As a Native, mixed race adoptee adopted by white people who only wanted a white baby - please don’t encourage people to adopt children they don’t actually want. This entire system is racist, and always has been.   The massive problem here, aside from the racism and white saviorism, is that selling babies is profitable. It’s a multibillion dollar industry profiting off the literal sale of infants, and generally, the exploitation of young women. I say this as an infertile queer person too who has explored/ lived both sides of this issue.  Adoption has been utilized by the US as a tool of genocide, and the way it is carried out can be compared to human trafficking. I am white passing and was worth more money with my heritage erased, so that is what was done. I lost my language, my heritage, my culture, my ethnicity and my family so a wealthier couple could get the parenting experience they wanted and were willing to pay for. Worth it to mention that I, like many other adoptees, had a plethora of relatives willing to raise me. But these people are very often not even given that chance. Several countries will not adopt to us because of these practices.   Adoptees also do not have the same basic rights to keep, or even *know* their identities, which is a violation of our basic human rights, according to the UN. We are essentially being entered into a contract that not only affects us, but our descendants as well. I am not legally related to anyone in my family, and the only people who can correct this are the people who adopted me. My identity was sold without my consent. And this legal arrangement will affect all my descendants, forever.  Adoption should be a rare thing that happens when a family is in crisis. It should be based on the well being of the child. Instead we have a system that treats infants as a commodity and people checking off forms like a dystopian build a bear order.   There are more people waiting to adopt than there are infants available, and that’s part of the reason roe was overturned. Nobody wants to discuss this, they just want to pretend this multibillion dollar industry is somehow “saving children.”   For more information:  Reading -  *The Girls Who Went Away* by Ann Fessler.  *Relinquished* by Gretchen Sisson.   *Child of the Indian Race* by Sandy White Hawk.  *We Were Once a Family* by Roxanna Asgarian.  *Torn Apart* by Dorothy Roberts.   *The Child Catchers - Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption* by Kathryn Joyce.  *American Baby* by Gabrielle Glaser.

As someone with a non-white adopted child it’s not as simple as ‘racism’ and I think the policy of it being a last resort is a good one.   Racism is part of it but also fears of racism from society is in there as well as well as various unexpected situations.   Having your kid wondering why the man is yelling at her dad as a creep for taking pictures of them at the park is one that comes to mind.,Otaraka,2025-05-01T16:40:39,1
"I'll play contrarian: I'd like to see these numbers after correcting for racial background of the parents. It's not only for racist reasons that parents of one racial background could be open to adopting only within the same racial background.   I'm not saying it's morally laudable, but I also can't impose my idea of virtue on someone else.  Since the white US population is 1.38x larger than the non-white population (58% over 42%), the fact that white kids get chosen with 1.27x frequency tells me that prospective adopting parents could be, in fact, not racist.",cazzipropri,2025-05-01T17:50:01,1
"Economics explains this more than racism. Racism may explain some of the economic disparity between races, but the adoption dynamics are way downstream of that.  We can assume families looking to adopt are wealthier, since it’s an expensive process. We can also assume families looking to adopt prefer children of the same race for reasons that aren’t necessarily racist. Since white families tend to be wealthier, we’d expect them to constitute a greater share of families looking to adopt, so there would be greater demand for white children. Couple that with the fact that white families give up their children for adoption at lower rates than other races, and we’ve got a classic supply and demand mismatch. That explains why white children are more expensive.   It’s not like there’s some racist person sitting in the back room at the adoption agency marking down prices for non-white kids.",donfausto,2025-05-01T18:01:37,1

"Can we stop pretending that people choosing not to adopt children who appear different from themselves are “doing the children a favor”. How is being left in a foster care system, often still a household with someone not the same race as you, better than being chosen to be part of a family. Also, we keep acting like there aren’t families everyday with biological children who don’t look them who manage just fine.  The problem is adoptive parents who want to treat adoption as some kind of thing to be hidden instead of celebrating these children as chosen and loved. I say this as a mixed race person who was adopted by white parents, who also have a biological child and another adopted child of a different race. I always knew I was adopted, but also always knew I loved for exactly who I was. Sure my parents got lots of questions and comments. But guess what, I get just as many about my own biological children who don’t look like me. Parenting can be hard for a ton of different reasons.

Not particularly. A white couple running around with a black kid is going to raise all sorts of uncomfortable questions and having to explain to every single person who sees him that he's adopted rather than the result of an affair is probably something that adoptive parents don't particularly want to have hanging over their heads all the time.

"This article gets so much wrong about adoption.   There's no central adoption authority in the US. There is no list. Each agency has its own way of doing things. Some probably make their own lists.

"This isn't really that crazy. Majority of people in the population are white and they want to adopt a child that looks like them. Many parents don't even want to tell the child they are adopted.  Having a non-white baby creates a lot of societal stigmas like the mother had an affair, or the child isn't the father's. The kid also grows up knowing that they aren't the biological child. This can make it difficult for the child growing up and even harder for the parents while bonding or raising the baby.   So not many people want that association, and not everyone is adopting to be a philanthropist. They're adopting because they can not have children of their own, so naturally, they want a child that closest looks like them for bonding purposes.

I have so many complex feelings about this. Objectively it’s wrong to value a child more because of skin tone that’s truly disgusting and wrong. But then on the other hand it can also be really difficult for interracial adoptions where children look wildly different than parents because the kids are always easily picked out as being adopted.        To be clear I am hoping to adopt children with my partner once my health improves and I have thought about this a lot. It can also be difficult for interracial families(where parents are one race kids another) to instill racial and culturally significant history in a non dismissive way although that’s much easier if you raise children in a diverse community.

"I don't know where ""Foster Care Newsletter"" gets its information, but race-based fees are largely a thing of the past.   In the 1990s, the Multi-ethnic Placement Act was passed, forbidding discrimination on the basis of race for adoptive parents. That is, the state could no longer stop White parents from adopting children of color. Right after that happened, it was common for agencies to charge race-based fees. It was harder to place infants and children of color, and there were more of them available, so fees for White infants were higher to basically subsidize the adoption of infants of color. Today, in private adoption, it's more rare for agencies to charge race-based fees. It's no longer all that difficult to place infants of color. Transracial adoption is more accepted, and more agencies are doing more outreach to recruit parents of color. However, there are still states that consider being Black ""special needs"" and foster/adoptive parents will receive higher subsidies for adopting Black children.  Also, Pete's ""list"" was just for his agency. There's no central adoption authority in the US. Every private agency has a client list, and no one really shares that info. So, while the list for his agency was longer for a White baby, that's not necessarily true for every agency in the US.",Rredhead926,2025-05-01T21:47:01,1

On one extreme, doesn't make any sense to me to place, say a black child in an all white family in Whites-town USA. The child won't have any peers to identify with, there won't be knowledgable health/mental health care providers, and so on. That's before mentioning all the stigma and racism they're going to face from from the get go. I think this is true for the reverse situation too.  If the same family lives in area with a larger demographic of that other race, now it makes a lot more sense because the child will have peers at school and all the resources to fill in the gaps from their adoptive family and be able to live their best life.   Same thing when it comes to special needs. A blind or deaf child is probably best suite for a family that knows how to navigate those issues, or can afford the time and money to deal with whatever need. It feels at odds with having biological kids, as you don't always have a choice, but given the choice I don't see why you wouldn't want to place the child where they have the best chance for the best life possible.  And at the end of the day, you can't force a family to adopt a child they don't want so it's never going to be free from discrimination.",blue60007,2025-05-01T20:26:59,2

I happen to be a transrace adoptive parent myself. Many white people will say “it’s not for me”, and that’s fine - not everyone is willing to be what we call a ‘conspicuous family’.

The decision to adopt a child is completely voluntary, if the adoptive parents don't have a say, then they don't adopt. You end up with less children adopted, and the ones that are less likely to be in a household where they'll succeed.   And besides, the biological parent also has a say in the adoption placement (less so in the foster system of course, but the state isn't going to randomly place children either). If they don't get a say, then they don't get adopted out and end up not getting placed into a better situation.",blue60007,2025-05-01T16:18:28,7
