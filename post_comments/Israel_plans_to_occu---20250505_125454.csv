"Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan Sunday night to gradually reoccupy all of Gaza and hold it indefinitely if no deal is reached by May 15. Plans for the operation call for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to flatten any buildings that remain standing and displace virtually the entire population of 2 million people to a single ""humanitarian area."" The alternative to remaining in the humanitarian zone is for Palestinians to leave the enclave ""voluntarily"" for other countries ""in line with President Trump's vision for Gaza,"" an Israeli official said. Such departures could hardly be considered voluntary, and no country has agreed thus far to accept displaced Palestinians. Israeli officials claim there are ongoing negotiations with several countries on that front.",The_Starving_Autist,2025-05-05T15:03:35,6

"The tension between the two is also a fascinating example of the US trying too hard to play ""great power politics"" at the expense of shoring up domestic support (moral signaling). Surely Biden could have just abandoned Israel with close to little negative impacts to the US if he really wanted. But his eyes were laser focused on international strategy instead of the culture war brewing at home.  His steadfast support clinging to a genocide cost him a number of votes and ultimately was one (of many) contributing factor that led to us getting a Trump presidency (and likely the ultimate collapse of the empire). There will definitely be international relations papers that use this moment as a case study.",Great_Northern_Beans,2025-05-05T15:08:27,2

It’s the candidate’s fault if they can’t garner enough support of their constituents, not the constituents. Harris needed to give folks more of a reason to vote for her and not just against Trump. Democrats need to be better, not just the voters (though everyone could be a bit better in general, myself included).  Bottomline is we need to stop blaming those who found Harris unconvincing.

"It’s still performative. He withheld 1 type of bomb, while supplying them with others. Others that were already being used for war crimes. Encouraging peace agreements that hold no teeth is of no use. They’re broken and nothing happens. That’s not how you deal with a genocide in progress. Especially when you’re directly providing weapons and funding for it. This is entirely my point, performative actions are just that. They’re not real differentiating factors between the administrations.  Meanwhile, the majority of congress from both major parties refused to stand up against genocide. At some point, people have to acknowledge what’s going on and that the leaders, regardless of party, have to be called out and resoundingly rejected if they can’t even say no to genocide. Trump, Biden, Harris, anyone who can’t say no to that and more importantly, actively fight against that, is not for humanity.
