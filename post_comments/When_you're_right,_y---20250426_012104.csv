"He wants a third term to stave off jail once he is a normal citizen again. He saw what happened after the first term. It'll be worse after his second term as he is just getting started with a list of offenses. A third term will further delay his imprisonment and he'll be looking for ways to ensure he can't be touched once he is a citizen again. We this happen in other countries, like Bolivia right now for instance, it is just sad that the U.S. political system is now comparable to developing nations...smh.",Party_Elevator2688,2025-04-26T11:43:37,11
"I hope we learn our lesson this time. We've failed to learn it after the Civil War. We allowed the traitors to go unpunished.    We failed to insist on the rule of law in the south. We left them to be a violent, poorly educated, criminal enclave surrounded by America.    We failed to to hold Nixon accountable. He should have stood trial. He should have gone to prison.   We failed to hold Reagan and Bush accountable. They should have gone to trial and prison.   Bush Jr should have been tried in the Hauge for war crimes and should be in prison.   We've never had an appetite for holding powerful white men accountable.   That needs to change.",IllustriousEast4854,2025-04-26T14:57:39,10
