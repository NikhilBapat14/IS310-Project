"This dictatorship won't announce itself  with tanks -  it has already started -  with dirty tricks.   If Republicans want a clear win, they could give the majority of their constituents what they are asking for. But their goal isn't to work for the people of North Carolina.   Their goal is to amass power.   If their policies are unpopular, they create a culture war. If the culture war doesn't fool enough people, they use dirty tricks. And if that doesn't give them a win, well they just start an Insurrection.   That's the Republican Way.   And the majority of people in North Carolina are sick of it.   >A North Carolina appeals court ruled Wednesday that a law stripping the governor’s authority to appoint State Board of Elections members can take effect for now, even though trial judges struck it down as unconstitutional just last week.  >Three judges on the intermediate-level Court of Appeals unanimously granted the request of Republican legislative leaders to suspend enforcement of that ruling. If left intact, the decision means provisions otherwise slated to take effect Thursday would shift the appointment duties from new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to GOP State Auditor Dave Boliek, at least temporarily.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-01T22:57:16,19

"This is the GOP way, in North Carolina - whether regarding unconstitutional voting districts, delegitimizing their verified election losses, or stealing constitutional powers of the governor, or disenfranchising the legal votes of non-GOPs. Take those arguments to the courts, persuade some partisan court hacks to allow them to implement until the unconstitutionality is verified, then do as much damage as possible before they're forced to back off.  This ain't the first time...",phosdick,2025-05-02T07:41:57,3
"> And the majority of people in North Carolina are sick of it.  I agreed with everything you wrote until here.  I haven't seen any signs that ""the majority of people in North Carolina"" care at all.",laseralex,2025-05-02T00:24:03,3
"Gerrymandering takes votes away from the majority and gives voice to a  rabid rural red religious minority.  If he had kept his dick in his pants, we'd have a Democrat  senator. Top officials voted in are all Democrats.   The trump backed nominees lost.   I went to a rally in a smaller city - I was astounded by the turnout. The majority of people driving by fully supported us while a handful gave us the finger.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-02T06:33:36,3
