""Ha! The richest most powerful man in the world can't have it all!""  ""Trump can't be an authoritarian"": this provides a sense of relief for the reader, placating them from the dangerous and serious gains that the Trump admin is making towards destroying the country  Guys, we're not too stupid to fall for these headlines, right?

"I think we should stop fixating on Trump. He's a distraction, a puppet signing away our freedoms.   The real danger is the person waiting in the wings, the one who understands how to weaponize these newly created powers.   Trump isn't laying the foundation for his permanent rule (though I will concede that he may think he is); he's creating the vulnerabilities a future, more calculating leader will exploit to consolidate power indefinitely.   We're not facing a Trump dictatorship; we're facing the potential for an American Putin.

"We shouldn't let that lessen the severity of what he is trying to do though. What bothers me about claims like these is that people act like Trump is single handedly working on his own. What they don't understand is that the sentiment of what he is trying to do is deeply engrained into the system. If we get rid of Trump- some other authoritative figure will just try to pick up where he left off. The only thing Trump has that others don't is a permission structure from his support base that lets him get away with a lot of horrid shit.

They been prepping for this takeover for damn near half a century.   It is barely May and project 2025 couldn’t ask for a more successful 4 months in their wildest dreams.

"“So if you’re worried about Trump amassing unstoppable power, here’s your consolation: He is probably too incompetent to pull it off.”  Matt Lewis is wrong more often than he’s right in his assessments of Trump and this time he’s way off. Trump is indeed incompetent, foolish and any other pejorative one can apply to a Mussolini wannabe and he does manage to step on his own dick twice daily. However Kevin Roberts and the Heritage Foundation are, unfortunately, not idiots. The speed and breadth of their infiltration of the U.S. government, at the behest of Trump, has been breathtaking. And while critics mock and deride Trump for his ineptness, the real players in this hostile theocratic takeover of the secular norms of American government are moving ahead, undeterred by the clownish missteps. If anything Trump’s goofiness has desensitized many Americans to the actual threat facing the country. General Mark Miley was correct when he warned that, “Trump is fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person in this country.”",blue_quark,2025-04-30T11:07:51,4
"Trump & Co. think that they can follow Putin's & Hitler's playbooks. They will fail. Both Putin & Hitler came to power after years of economic devastation in their countries.

No matter how much Trump tries to gaslight us into believing that the Biden economy was horrible, the fact is that the Biden economy was robust and getting better. What's more is that Trump, unlike Putin & Hitler, is making our economy worse everyday.

"A dude named Jonathan Rauch puts a finer point on what ""this"" is on a recent episode of The Bulwark podcast. At about the 10 minute mark (linked below), he starts to explain the nuanced distinction from what we typically think of as *authoritarianism* and sheds light on something (new to me), called *patrimonialism*. I think if you give it a listen you will have an ah-ha moment or two. It's cool if you don't want to, too.    https://youtu.be/uxoijQfFg8I?si=V-SosfHpEF4nUa6m&t=9m54s   If you are talking with people in real life, getting this nuance right could be helpful in convincing them Trump is for Trump, not for them. People recoil at hyperbole like *Nazi* and *dictator* even if it's pretty accurate, so introducing a new lens could help manage reactions.    I understand the frustration with the situation and the headlines. We can do other things in the here and now, too, but I really need you, dear reader, to continue to believe we're going to have the chance to vote our way out of this mess. Getting the diagnosis right is important so we can try to reach anyone who will give you an opening. ",fantasmalicious,2025-04-30T11:52:41,2

Plus, Trump is a mere symptom of the core problem-that Americans have lost control of their information space protections and have legalized unlimited political spending by anonymous donors thanks primarily the the R party and stuff like Citizens United. This then also poisons the Dem party even though none of their appointed judges ever voted pro-corruption in campaign finance. This is because their candidates are just as beholden to big money now that the guard rails are removed-as I discovered as a lobbyist and attorney.

"We are getting close to their ultimate goals, it’s what Peter Thiel/Palantir (an actual german Nazi) is working with Cantor Fitzgerald and their ex-chairman and now commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to achieve. Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  Edit: gift article very nicely given by u/ Advanced_Level  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.h6d7.ZwcbvFMgtpjZ&smid=url-share  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-04-30T12:57:47,1

It is worship of an idea that has almost no reference to reality.     Kings were almost always terrible, but people like the aesthetic, and that is all that matters. So it does not matter that he is bad at it, it only matters that people will pretend he is good at it in a huge game of make-believe.   It is not even that he has ""competent people around him."" He does not need that to succeed. They can all be idiots. A vast majority of them are idiots. It does not matter, because they pander to the insecurities of the people giving them power, and those people will gladly continue to give them power no matter how dumb they are as long as they keep stoking that fear. People constantly think that there needs to be some kind of machiavellian plan for authoritarianism to take over, but the really scary thing is that there doesn't need to be.

After they smash all the barriers, someone that is competent will find a way to come in and take advantage. It also won't take long.  The best case is there's a little more time to plug the holes and change course than we might otherwise have had.",alwaysbeblepping,2025-04-30T16:07:25,1
"Hitler was known for wild mood swings and changing policies on a whim. His inner circle was entirely made up of yes men who told him what they thought he wanted to hear. They spent most of their time sabotaging each other in an effort to gain his favor. They were not competent leaders, but they still managed to do horrific things. The reason is that it's only difficult to run a government well, it doesn't take a genius to break things.",starmartyr,2025-04-30T18:12:11,1

">Why are news outlets obsessed with trying to gaslight everyone into thinking what is currently happening can't happen?  It aligns with their interests, and it's what people want to hear, even if it's comforting bullshit.  This is a case where people don't want to be told what they need to hear from other sources. It wouldn't be well-received and it likely wouldn't drive ad impressions.  Besides, most of the people still following these legacy outlets assume only electoral solutions merit consideration. They're usually the ones replaying the last election in their minds, grasping onto ""if only"" straws.  Will they keep coping? Or will they go left? Story at 11.",commitme,2025-04-30T15:21:30,3

"That person is Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem, both of whom are doing much of the legwork on the authoritarian take over. And neither of whom are going to give their power bases quietly.   Their biggest liability is that they're women, and MAGA doesn't really like women. Which, admittedly, is also probably why they're more effective. To be a successful woman in that milieu requires you to be cunning, at a minimum, or you get tossed out like Laura Loomer. Whereas ""successful"" men tend to be fail-upwards types like Hegseth or the President himself, who then just bounce around making messes.",AdHopeful3801,2025-04-30T09:39:22,5
