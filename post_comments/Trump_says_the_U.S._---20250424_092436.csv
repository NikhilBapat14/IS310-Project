China doesn't have to discuss anything.    Trump created all of this unilaterally.  China's tariffs are all reciprocal.  Trump can lower them to whatever he wants without speaking to anybody.    Only 15% of China's exports come here.  They don't need to negotiate anything.,Searchlights,2025-04-24T09:46:27,13
"Trump lives entirely in his own head.  He lies, but more than than he doesn't care what is true.  He says what benefits him in the moment.  Half the time, he believes it in the moment. He has said so in depositions.  What astounds me is how few people call bullshit to his face.  I will never understand the dark magnetism of the narcissist.  It revolts me on sight.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-24T10:00:24,8

"Trump says... not China says...   Trump finally has realized the implications of tariffs on Americans, but still has no idea how to fix the situation without fully embarrassing himself and showing how wrong his policies have been. He will find someone to blame, make another tariff or exemption pause, or integrate another false agreement tale.",OrbeaSeven,2025-04-24T09:38:41,3

"I can almost hear the conversation: “Look. Jinping. We don’t need a deal. It’s not even important. But you need to *say* we have a deal. It will work out great for everyone.

What is sad is that trump is going to lose a tariff war against China twice at rate. He ended up losing the first fight during the initial term and now he is slowly caving for this one.,KazeNilrem,2025-04-24T10:30:08,1
Trump is telling an untruth? How very unlike him. It's gotten to the point that his word is utterly worthless. He just makes shit up that can easily be fact-checked for validity. That doesn't bode well for our precarious standing in the world.,invalidpassword,2025-04-24T10:45:53,1

In about 30 days supply shortages will  start becoming apparent Container ships from China have stopped.  The US is dependent on China for our supply chain.  West coast ports will grind to a halt.  Trump or whoever is the next President will have to call Xi to avert this disaster.  Xi has the upper hand in this war.,Lott4984,2025-04-24T12:51:00,1

"Yup. And that whole “glitch” of tariffs not being collected at the ports is even further proof that all of this is nothing more than a pump-and-dump scheme.  …And at this point, I’m just wondering how long until China realizes what’s going on here and gets on Cheeto Putin’s case about it.",IAmArique,2025-04-24T10:24:51,26
"Maybe, but I think it's also likely that Trump assumed that China would come begging the moment he announced his stupid tariff number, and he was humiliated when his phone didn't ring. This feels like a sad attempt to save face.",LurkinsteinMonster,2025-04-24T11:31:28,9

Trump will confabulate and make shit up as a reflex — you can bet he won’t even remember saying they are meeting about tariffs because he only said they were as a reflex to a question.,nanobot001,2025-04-24T13:22:15,1

"That's the Key thing here.  China has such a lead in manufacturing capability and worldwide partnerships that they don't really need the USA.  It didn't have to be this way, but that's what happens when you ship virtually every factory overseas over the course of decades.  As much as I would like to see the United States rebuild its industrial capability, it's going to take years, and Americans are going to expect fair wages and benefits.  This is all assuming companies even want to do that in the first place.  This could not have been handled more poorly.",DonCreech,2025-04-24T10:27:28,10

I dont believe anything the Chinese ministry of commerce says anymore than I believe what Trump says. Hence my predicament.   Im not sure what relevance solidarity talk has in these circumstances; the Chinese private sector either complies or is made to comply.,430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T10:59:06,-1
