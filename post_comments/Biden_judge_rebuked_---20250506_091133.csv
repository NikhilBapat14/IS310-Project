"The admin should ignore them. They were overruled by a higher court for their district. Sorry, Charlie.",ITrCool,2025-05-06T10:43:31,65
"So, should the administration listen to a judge who has been overruled by a higher court?  I think not.",mdws1977,2025-05-06T09:33:40,100
Look how hard it is to get them out once they're here. Close the damn door and keep it shut. These judges need to be stopped. The supreme court needs to get off it's ass and stop this or we will NEVER see the end of the lawfare against the will of the people.,Feeling_Maize_2,2025-05-06T09:26:33,53
Damn there are some really stupid judges out there huh,Simmumah,2025-05-06T10:49:40,24
"Hmm, the guys who were screaming ""let the courts adjudicate the issue!"" When the injunctions first started are oddly silent now for some reason.  I distinctly remember arguing with some dude from Britain who was adamant about the thing, claiming he was a constitutional expert and all... Nowhere to be seen now.  Weird.",Shadeylark,2025-05-06T11:14:05,24
"Not sure why the administration should listen to any judge on this matter... They came here illegally, they get deported, end of story.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-06T15:27:14,12

We are trying to get people out. How about no refugees.,WarfRatsColdCoffee,2025-05-06T11:32:26,8
"He can make all of the demands he he wants. He can't do anything if he has already been overruled. The administration will just ignore him, as they should. This judge is just desperate to try to make himself into some kind of leftist celebrity.",Pugnatum_Forte,2025-05-06T15:38:27,7
"Only Congress can enjoin the president.  Congress needs to impeach, or, STFU.",Device_whisperer,2025-05-06T12:02:13,5

"You don't understand.  Because Democrats don't control Congress, that means that Congress won't impeach Trump, and that means the Congress is compromised, which means they need to find another way to do the things they want to undermine the will of the people.",Shadeylark,2025-05-07T05:01:59,2
"Like I said, their alternative is to STFU.",Device_whisperer,2025-05-07T10:05:35,1
