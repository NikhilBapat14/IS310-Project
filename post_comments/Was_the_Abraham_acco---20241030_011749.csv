"Well it led to Hamas Oct 7 attack on Israel.  Which led to the razing of Gaza.  Which led to further ethnic cleansing of the West Bank.  And then led to the ground invasion of Lebanon by Israel, Houthi strikes on intl shipping, and now Israel and Iran mutually attacking each other.  But it got Trump’s son in law a sweet deal with the Saudis after he left office.  So I guess it’s a mixed bag.",[deleted],2024-10-31T21:12:17,3
"Increased travel and trade between any two countries has a near perfect track record globally.   And picking sides between the Suni and Shia conflict puts Iran on the outside diplomatically, which I personally think is the right position for America to hold.",skins_team,2024-10-31T17:14:46,2
"LOL.  Yeah, looked upon charitably, it was a gamble. Every previous attempt at a regional peace deal had tried to incorporate a resolution to the Palestinian question. The Trump approach was to promote a deal between the major Gulf states and Israel while sidelining the Palestinians (and by proxy, the Iranians) in order to get something done. The theory was that the Palestinian question would get resolved once the major players were all more aligned and committed to their own economic growth.  In one way, you can say it kind of worked, temporarily. They got a deal done when nobody else could, at least on paper. But the Palestinians and their Iranian backers were not just going to sit back and be sidelined while watching the region advance around them. The accords, once fully implemented, would have made both of those parties even more irrelevant than they already are, dashing any hopes that they could ever achieve their own goals.  The October 7th attack was the logical conclusion of that. Israel should have seen it coming. Now the whole region is in chaos and I think there's a strong case it wouldn't have been that way without the Abraham Accords, though it's certainly hard to prove a counter-factual.",nosecohn,2024-10-31T23:53:23,1
"It was good for peace seeking, rational human beings, not so good for religious extremists:   We, the undersigned, recognize the importance of maintaining and strengthening peace in the Middle East and around the world based on mutual understanding and coexistence, as well as respect for human dignity and freedom, including religious freedom.  We encourage efforts to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue to advance a culture of peace among the three Abrahamic religions and all humanity.",Crazy_Universe_Alpha,2024-11-09T10:07:27,1
"Nope. Wasn’t good for Palestine, in the end, nor for the Middle East writ large. Things have only gotten worse since then.  I evaluate outcomes. Not aspirational words.",[deleted],2024-11-17T12:57:35,1
