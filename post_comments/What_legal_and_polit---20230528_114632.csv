"> For example, if the government runs out of money, why couldn't the President selectively shut down, just in red states, things like the BLM, BOEM, BSEE, EPA, OSHA etc, and then direct federal law enforcement to close all related industry  If you shut down those agencies, you're furloughing the 'federal law enforcement' you're expecting to close all related industry. It's not like the Marines step up to enforce occupational law when all the OSHA guys aren't in the office.  There is some wiggle room in terms what you designate as 'essential' or 'non-essential' government functions but it's not particularly relevant. Your average citizen barely notices a government shutdown is occurring. Even the industrialists you're imagining might be harmed don't notice it much because it mainly manifests in an interruption of oversight rather than an interruption in operations.  The people who *do* notice are the 'non-essential' government workers who aren't collecting their paychecks. They notice immediately - and they're overwhelmingly Democrats.",ViskerRatio,2023-06-01T00:36:23,5
"It’s not as cut and dry. When you shut down agencies in red states, as the other comment suggests, you’re only furloughing them and let’s say even if you did that, their payroll is a drop in the bucket compared to US budget. Most of federal expenses are social security, healthcare, defense, Medicare etc.   Now, you cant just shut down social security for citizens in red states. That would result in the government being sued.",curious_mindz,2023-06-07T20:03:21,2
I think what the original post is trying to accomplish is to require a shutdown of the businesses that are subject to oversight due to the lack of personnel overseeing the businesses.,overeducatedhick,2023-06-11T04:38:10,1
