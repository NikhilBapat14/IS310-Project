"This is impeachable. He took an oath to defend the constitution and a person’s immigration status, legal or otherwise, does not matter. The 5th and 14th amendments of our constitution guarantees  all people within our borders due process. If a president publicly states they won't (or doesn’t know if they will) uphold the Constitution, it’s a violation of the Oath of Office, an impeachable offense. You may not like it, you may not agree with it, but that’s where we stand.",Funky-Buddah,2025-05-04T10:37:34,116

"If the supreme court had integrity, they'd rule these statements about the constitution as a voluntary resignation of his office. The only powers and responsibilities the President has are those derived from the constitution, if he isn't upholding the constitution, and he's making comments that ascribe his intent to ignore it, then by definition, he isn't the president.",The-Magic-Sword,2025-05-04T13:27:13,3

That would have been nice with a previous Congress,xxxxx420xxxxx,2025-05-04T14:03:23,5
"It would be nice if it were that simple. But because they declared an emergency and then used the alien enemies act as cover, they can make the argument that they are operating within the law. However, the courts have recently clarified that position as not being valid, although that was done at a district level, so it now has to go through the appellate system. The bigger issue currently is that they have not obeyed the orders of the SCOTUS and lower level courts that have ordered them to facilitate the return of Garcia. President Trump even recently said he could have him returned but he won't - so this isn't a confusion over whether they can or cannot - they simply won't. That IMO warrants his removal.",uknow_es_me,2025-05-04T14:56:44,2

"He can't destroy anything, including our constitution. At least not singlehandedly. It's fine to keep pointing out that what Trump is doing is wrong, immoral, and illegal, but when it comes time to hold people accountable, we need to make sure to include all of the people that went along with this, because otherwise he's just a scapegoat that doesn't affect anything.",OisinDebard,2025-05-04T15:33:56,2

"It’s so odd that he, a pathological liar, would be honest about this (and other stupid shit), but lie about everything else.
