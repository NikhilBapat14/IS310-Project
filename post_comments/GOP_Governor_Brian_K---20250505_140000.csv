"Big news for this Georgian.  Kemp is pretty savvy and pretty popular, but seems like he thinks it will be a very unfavorable environment.  I canvassed for Ossoff way back when in spring 2017 when he lost a House race against Karen Handel.  However, I'm the world's worst canvasser.  Did get to meet him and John Lewis at an event before the pandemic.",Faramir1717,2025-05-05T15:20:08,118
Kemp hates trump THAT much apparently.,philafly7475,2025-05-05T15:03:50,77
Kemp seeing a blue wave in the near future and looking to preserve his hopes for running for Presidency unblemished?,blackertai,2025-05-05T15:52:15,36
"Thank goodness! This makes the race instantly go from ""Lean R"" to ""Tilt D"".  Ossoff must be breathing a HUGE sigh of relief right now...",M795,2025-05-05T17:01:21,37
He may also be passing since he knows Trump hates him for the 2020 election in GA.,buzzedewok,2025-05-05T22:19:25,8

He likely sees that the midterms are not going to be a fun time for the GOP and should stay out of it when they’re going to have to play some major defense.,blueblurz94,2025-05-05T21:05:45,5
"Thank fuck. He would've been the toughest challenger.  But this confirms he will be running for the GOP nomination in 2028. Best possible scenario he wins that, because he would be one gigantic step up from what we have right now. He's probably the sanest Republican who stands a chance at winning the nomination. We would be guaranteed that, at least.",KR1735,2025-05-06T03:49:28,5
"Good, now we need to convince Roy Cooper to run in NC and we have a blue wave",Free_Ad3997,2025-05-06T04:16:53,3

Glad to hear it because Kemp would have won.,SallyJane5555,2025-05-06T10:15:41,1
"It’s in the air… Republicans are going to take a beating in all contested elections in the near term. Kemp knows, and he knows that we know.",Purpleappointment47,2025-05-07T18:14:40,1
"I think Ossoff is absolutely amazing and the future.  Normally, I would chip into support him.  However, in the last cycle I donated a reasonable amount to various blue causes and I am now tormented with endless text messages (about 5 per day).  I also get a huge number of emails but can deal with these.  Regarding the cell phone - I cannot take the continual distractions to my life and I resent the Democratic Party as a whole for what I consider a form of harassment.   This has now affected my mental health -why should I have to be distracted and reply STOP five times per day?  I am out - the Democratic Party will never see another dime from me and I will not support any causes.  I dont care if we give up everything to the orange dictator.  I simply hate my party and refuse to support it in any fashion unless this policy changes  I hope others will join me in this",deceipt_river,2025-05-05T18:22:38,-8
I fist bumped Sen Ossoff the other day at Inman Park Festival Parade. I'll help canvas for him this time around.,DeadMoneyDrew,2025-05-05T21:03:30,9
"He does. But he also knows it’s a bad time to be a Republican’s running agains fresh, energetic Dems. Go, Jon, go!",GaryOoOoO,2025-05-05T16:07:40,53
"He's also shrewd and knows Trump won't be around forever (Trump turns 79 in 40 days).   If the GOP survives, it won't be sniveling Trump lickspittles who rescue it from itself.",clamorous_owle,2025-05-05T17:55:19,10
OMG this is good fucking news. I hope he means it. You know these people want to control the narrative and announce when they are ready so I don’t really trust him. But he is one of the few gop that showed some spine and stood up to Trump.,Cluefuljewel,2025-05-05T20:01:05,1
This is his time,bapeach-,2025-05-05T18:17:00,9
"Tilt D? I hate to burst your bubble, but no. Ossoff has a good chance but he had to have a come from behind in a runoff to beat David Perdue, and Warnock barely beat a guy who doesn't know what a prop is.",DeadMoneyDrew,2025-05-05T21:05:02,-5
Would love to see he fade into obscurity,tenaciousdewolfe,2025-05-05T15:12:10,1

It is always a bad time to be a Republican.,autumn55femme,2025-05-05T21:42:14,3
That be funny if he and JD Vance primary at the same time,bapeach-,2025-05-05T18:11:11,7
