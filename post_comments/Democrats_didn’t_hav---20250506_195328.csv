"The Hill doing their classic ""both siding"" of the parties.  One has some internal and external issues to work thru.  The other is a fucking fascist regime ignoring the fucking Constitution.

"The most disgraceful clown show I've ever witnessed. From Schumer planning to go on his fucking book tour rather than fight in the Senate, to Booker fillibustering a Trump apopintee and then turning around and voting for a bunch of them immediately after, this party has proven it is full of greasy, fat, donor-fed fools.   Primary every last one of these stooges. They do not deserve the power they wield and they have proven incapable of wielding it competently.   They're there to make money, do insider trading, and have their puppet strings plucked by all the worst corporations and foreign governments with a checkbook.   Get rid of every last one of these weak ass losers. Primary them and fill our legislative body with people actually courageous enough to do the fucking job and fulfill the oath.  **EDIT**: And before some mewling fool talks about 'whataboutism', or accuses me of going soft on Republicans or whatever the fuck excuse they always use to not hold these people accountable, just shut the fuck up for one minute and ask yourself **why** you don't hold your own fucking party accountable for doing the bare minimum of their jobs, and **how** will they ever fucking win an election again if you DON'T hold them accountable for their endless carnival of errors?  You have numerous Democrats voting for Trump appointees. Still. LIke right fucking now they're still doing it. Why? Why in the absolute fuck? What the absolute fuck does any Democrat in congress have to gain by voting for Trump apopintees? How the fuck does it benefit us, their constituents, for them to vote with Republicans? I mean seriously someone fucking tell me. That going to get Republicans to cross the fucking aisle? As they're enabling and empowering a fucking dictator show doesn't plan on giving up power whne his second term is done? Like are you fucking serious?  You have them voting to pass Republican legislation. You have the Senate Minority leader going on a book tour. You have the Dems in the House putting a terminal 70-year-old man dying of cancer as **head of the fucking Oversight committee**.   These people literaly had years to prepare for Project 2025 and have mounted **literally no fucking resistance**. They do nothing.  They should be out in the fucking streets pointing and organizing **all** Americans to action. Fuck the Seante floor, they should be out **acting** like an actual opposition party leading a people's resistance against a dictator.   Instead Schumer is going on the 24-hour news cycles talking about saddling up with Republicans in the gym and trying to reason with them.   Motherfuckers these are insurrectionists. What the fuck are you reasoning with. These people are ravaging the country and every Republican will vote for a tax bill to steal 4 trillion fucking dollars from all of us to give to billionaires who already have more money than God and your'e fucking talking to them in the gym??  People PLEASE. Fucking PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE recognize what a fucking clown show this is. These people are pathetic. You will never, ever safeguard the Republican against fascism or fix the myriad holes Trump and Republicans have punched in to the fabric of our consitution with this geriatric, useless group of weak fools at the helm.   If you give them all three branches of government they will use it to restore the same system that empowered Trump and Republicans to begin with. It is all they know how to do. They will **always** disappoint you.   Take over the fucking party. Run for every office you can think of. Expel the incumbents and empower people who will actually fucking do something, or you will get the same results.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T20:27:21,11
"They could have a better 100 days. Everyone knows Trump is gonna flood the gate, disregard the law and pump out fake news daily.  And now the dems still be like ""oh no I didn't expect that, we are overwhelmed you know"".",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-06T20:38:48,3
"An outsider's perspective, from years of looking at US politics in bewilderment from a more traditional ""Westminster"" style democracy (Australia). Here, we are used to a fairly organised party structure with s defined party platform decided by party members, a leadership team chosen under the rules of whichever party it is, and pretty strictly enforced party rules. There's a leader, a deputy, a cabinet or shadow cabinet of ministers responsible for portfolios, and the leaders are members of parliament, and directly accountable via parliament to the people. The idea of an opposition party or parties without a clearly identified leader is quite unfamiliar to us.  The very first thing a party that's lost an election here (as happened this week in Australia) is to sort out its leadership and start working on its policy platform for the years ahead. Utterly bizarre to us as outsiders watching the Democrats infighting and rudderless and disunited this far into the Trump second term.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-05-07T03:18:01,3

"In summary, the USA's Two-Party System has demonstrated that it has failed the nation.  It is now time to end the Reign of the Oligarchs & end the Two Party System.  Trump is a GOP Apparatchik; Schumer is a Democrat Apparatchik.    Time to turn the USA into a liberal Democracy.  The vast majority of Americans do not want Cheeto Hitlerism; nor does Schumerite Von Papanesque Centerism appeal either.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-05-06T19:59:00,9

"Voters haven’t had a great 100 days. Most other countries are aghast at what’s happening here and are rethinking trade and military alliances, and voters are out to lunch. Trump’s liberty day tariffs or whatever almost crashed the economy and bond market, and even the reduced tariffs could very well cause a recession, and voters are out to lunch. Permanent legal residents are being shadow realmed and even some citizens are being arrested by ICE, and voters are out to lunch. Dems could fine tune their messaging, sure, but they almost have to do absolutely nothing and should be winning tons of votes just by not being Trump. Severe brain damage in the electorate to think Trump still deserves a chance here and/or that both sides are the same. Give me a break, man.",StormOk7544,2025-05-06T20:54:03,2

That's what happens when you are voted out of leadership in all branches of government.   Now Trumpers are begging them to stop the guy they voted for.
