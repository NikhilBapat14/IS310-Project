"""Since 2013, WEF received nearly **$60 million** from U.S. taxpayers.""

It provides a global, impartial and not-for-profit platform for meaningful connection between stakeholders to establish trust, and build initiatives for cooperation and progress.""  What a load of buzzword bullshit. It sounds like a bad resume objective: to obtain a meaningful position whereby I can foster public and private cooperation in an ever-changing global environment.  That's definitely something our tax dollars should go toward.",cossbobo,2025-04-30T15:33:04,0
