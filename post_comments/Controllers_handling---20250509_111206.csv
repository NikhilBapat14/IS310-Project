This is all Mayor Buttgiggle and his nefarious plot to make us all commute by bicycle with our same-sex partner on the back in the midst of a loving relationship.,hunter15991,2025-05-09T11:23:34,10
I’ve been trying to get back to Newark for the last 5 hours. Delay after delay after delay. It’s trumps fault and while it’s far from the worst thing he’s done I sure fuckin hope he pays for all of it,Didntlikedefaultname,2025-05-09T16:06:27,2

Clearly its Trump and Musks fault but I feel like not enough people are giving Duffy shit for this   I actually liked some of his ideas when he was confirmed but he's proved to be an absolute shit show as well who really doesn't seem to be doing anything to help fix all the aircraft and FAA issues,blues111,2025-05-09T11:20:51,4

It doesn't help when Musk tells Duffy to cut even more FAA employees when we are already short staffed   https://fortune.com/2025/03/08/elon-musk-doge-cuts-faa-air-traffic-controllers-layoffs-sean-duffy-plane-crashes/   And clearly something has changed because while issues existed to some degree before Trump 2 it was not THIS bad ,blues111,2025-05-09T12:24:47,7
"But Trump and Musk asked for FAA employees to voluntarily take early retirement, and hundreds did so.  Then, Trump and Musk fired hundreds more.  Now, the FAA is like Swiss cheese.  There's no way they can function properly.  It's totally Trump and Musk's fault.  They did this.  They are completely responsible for the chaos that is happening.",Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-09T16:20:59,2

You didn't answer my question. These problems have been antiquated hardware failing. The issue on April 28 was due to a copper wire burning out.,css555,2025-05-09T16:31:56,1
"The reason it hasn’t been upgraded is because republicans have refused to fund it the last 2 decades. They were updating the systems under biden and then trump and musk came in, shut everything down and turned everything over to starlink. This is specifically a mess that trump and elon made.",candaceelise,2025-05-09T14:22:24,6
"And what exactly are Trump and Musk doing to fix the situation?    Absolutely nothing.    In fact, they're taking the FAA's problems and making them way worse.",Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-09T16:33:58,2
In the last 2 decades there have been six years when Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. Why wasn't it funded then?  \>and turned everything over to starlink  Have a source for that?,css555,2025-05-09T16:19:59,-2
