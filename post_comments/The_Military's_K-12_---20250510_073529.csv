"> For months, officials atop this agency have been quietly flagging and banning dozens of books in response to President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive orders requiring federal agencies to eliminate programs or materials related to diversity, equity and inclusion. >  > The effect is that tens of thousands of kids in U.S. military families living on military bases worldwide no longer have access at their school libraries to celebrated and highly recommended books that happen to talk about LGBTQ+ people and people of color.  The consequences of this admin's wholesale attack on individual rights and education are catastrophicâ€”and it wouldn't surprise me if they last generations",UWCG,2025-05-10T07:37:23,52
"""They don't got to burn the books, they just remove them.""    This sort of thing had the opposite effect on me as a kid.  Books and literature (music, too) that were deemed controversial were highly sought after by my friend group and we always found them.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-10T07:50:41,40

" Itâ€™s still so unbelievable that we are banning books about POC, gays, and certain kinds of women. I mean, this barely makes the news. Trump is erasing history and barely a blip.  Itâ€™s fucking horrible.",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-10T07:49:58,24

"Itâ€™s more disgusting than just removing books. The day the EO came out an employee at an elementary school in Germany removed all artwork of persons of color. Art that had been painted by another employee for children. Art that included a portrait of Michelle Obama, a First Lady. These EOs have let the racists in the military community show their true colors. The kids have been doing amazing protesting, including a walkout when WhiskeyLeaks made a visit.",ChimpanzeeRumble,2025-05-10T09:53:59,5

Trump canâ€™t read. Why does he care about books?,SlowFootJo,2025-05-10T11:39:58,1
The most shocking realization to me is my daughter heard Trump say sheâ€™ll need to only have 2 or 3 dolls.   I need to realize that the America and President that my daughter grows up with is very different from the one I grew up in and is actually antagonistic to her well being.,simsimulation,2025-05-10T08:34:48,23
