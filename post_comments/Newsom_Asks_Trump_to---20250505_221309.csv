"Less than 20 days ago he is asking Canadians to come to California because we are not like trump and trump’s policies in washing dc are a country away.   He wouldn’t even say his name and tried to distance himself from Trump and now pushing to try and shutdown filming anywhere in Canada with Trump’s tariffs and begging for a subsidy.   He is the epitome of a slimy politician, will work every opposing angle at the same time and whoever pays him gets his loyalty. No morals, no virtue.

"Honestly the rich can pay more taxes and a bunch of these actors and producers get $20 million for a few months work and do not pay a strewed amount. The rock made $124 million in 2018. I could be wrong but something tells me he didn’t pay $49M in taxes that year. But let’s say he did. That’s just federal taxes. That’s just one person. Where the fuck is the rest of the money going? Hollywood probably pays a huge amount. Billions. They should pay more cause $75M per year is more than enough to live on and create generational wealth, but we need a more legit tracking system of all the money.

I agree.   Here’s the reality- they can cut whatever deal they want for the most part because the production time of most movies is longer than a presidential term.  The movies from this won’t be out until 2030-ish. Absolute worst case and they’re trying to approve shit?  Stretch the timeline while filming what you want.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-05T22:22:47,-3

"I'd rather have it help Hollywood where in turn that stimulates jobs for thousands of adjacent workers (including down the line individuals including the film crews and support industries like caterers, seamstress, rental houses, teachers, supply shops, etc) than see another billion dollar buddy contract to Elon for Cyber trucks or Starlink or whatever next he is grifting up.  Money for Hollywood isn't just money for stars and execs. It's the entire infrastructure in Southern California that will benefit.   In fact, speaking of Hollywood versus Doge...  Did you know it cost Elon Musk $277 million in donations to buy his way into the White House?  And did you know it cost $356 million dollars to shoot the last Avengers movie!?  That means it was $79 million dollars cheaper for Musk to buy his way into a position with our President than it was to make a blockbuster film.   Oh...and another fun fact...Endgame has grossed $2.799 billion dollars world wide and created thousands of jobs through benefits like:  Direct Employment: The production of ""Avengers: Endgame"" directly employed a significant number of individuals in various roles, including actors, crew members, and technical staff.   Indirect Employment: The film's success led to increased revenue for related industries, such as film studios, theaters, merchandise providers, and tourism-related businesses, creating indirect job opportunities.   Stimulating Economic Activity: The global box office success of ""Avengers: Endgame"" contributed to a surge in economic activity, stimulating demand for goods and services and indirectly supporting jobs across the economy.   Worldwide Impact: The film's success reached global markets, leading to increased tourism, international distribution, and merchandising opportunities, creating additional job opportunities in these areas.

">Then Trump gets to be the guy who wants to help destroy Hollywood and American cinema (which I can't imagine is a very popular position, nationwide).  You have to be careful with assuming these things. It will be popular among his base that thinks Hollywood is ""woke"". They will love Trump for doing this.  What's more likely to happen is that the subsidies come with requirements to ""not push woke propaganda"" or ""reject DEI"", or even worse, it might require movies to have a minimum set of ""patriotic"" criteria.",Rich_Housing971,2025-05-06T10:59:40,1

Just an addition to this. 1 in 10 people in la county work in the film industry. This money also circulates to non industry businesses.
