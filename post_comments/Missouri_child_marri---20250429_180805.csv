Even a broken state is right twice a century.,AnalTongueDarts,2025-04-29T18:16:54,26
Hard to celebrate this in 2025. It would have felt disappointingly late if this was heading for the governor’s desk in 1850.,Worried-Rub-7747,2025-04-29T18:33:46,12
Ok well hopefully that passes seems like a great idea ,Decent-Friend7996,2025-04-29T18:33:43,4

Looks like all those bald heads are swimming caps and they're about to lock the doors and start filling it with water while the spectators are issued bb guns to interfere with the ensuing game of bigot-bilge water polo.,SoupSpelunker,2025-04-29T19:54:23,1
Although reading the article kinda makes your soul die so not sure about that.,placated,2025-04-29T18:26:25,6
Unfortunately child marriage is still legal in Alabama and 36 other states.,beccaface,2025-04-29T18:21:41,12
Child marriage should never be supported ever,FlamEagle78,2025-04-29T18:18:32,7

"The problem is, unsurprisingly, Christian communities...both black and white. For them, the real problem isn't necessarily the age, but having a child out of wedlock. The idea is to ""punish"" any rapists with being forced to take care of a wife and their child, but in practice it just...leads to a cycle of rape.  ""Sex is for child-making, and marriage is for child-rearing: therefore, if someone is having sex, even if they are very young, they should be forced to marry to protect any children that would result"" is only a valid take if safe abortion isn't an option. Guess what also Christians are targeting?     Unfortunately, wealthy social-conservatives still make up the bulk of funding, for both conservatives and liberals. So many advocacy groups wind up fighting against investors in a proxy war.  It almost always takes an extreme, and PUBLIC, case of blatant law and child abuse for them to change their minds.",ragingreaver,2025-04-30T10:39:26,2
"Only 4 states have no minimum (MS, OK, CA and NM). And I believe there’s only 1 where it’s 15.",beccaface,2025-04-29T18:45:11,3
I think his point is that just about every other 1st world country enacted this kind of law in the 20th century or earlier. America is 100 years behind the rest of the world.,Nessy_monster36903,2025-04-30T01:00:14,1
California having no min is strange to me! ,Decent-Friend7996,2025-04-29T18:49:59,4

Yeah. It’s crazy. [It’s because the ACLU of CA and Planned Parenthood of CA have opposed the legislation in recent years.](https://calmatters.org/politics/2023/06/child-marriage-california/),beccaface,2025-04-29T18:58:39,2
