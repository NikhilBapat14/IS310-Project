Should we expect ICE to arrest family members of their fellow ICE agents at some point?,thieh,2025-04-27T08:11:30,38

Sure are a lot of accounts defending this and attacking the military / making excuses already in the comments.   I smell a bot farm.,RCG73,2025-04-27T08:55:17,6

Seriously?  Maybe just send a strongly worded letter and inform their commander that this sailor needs to get their household in order.,Andovars_Ghost,2025-04-27T23:21:43,0
No.  And don't expect illegals working for the rich in East Hampton and similar communities to be arrested either.,nwgdad,2025-04-27T08:15:02,26
That’s an interesting point. I would hope that ICE is conducting deep audits of its own people which is as it should be. Any violators need to be identified and dismissed with whatever prosecution is appropriate.,RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T08:47:31,2
"I’m far from a fan of Trump or the means that he is using but let’s reserve judgment here until the facts are in. The tell will be if the CG conducts non-judicial or court martial proceedings against the service member. Keep in mind too that aside from the relevant immigration issues, marriage and the lower enlisted ranks are not a good combination.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T08:44:58,-11
"Yours is a valid sentiment but ignores the broadest possible picture. There is and always has been a certain level of convenience marriages in the military. Sometimes to permit the immigrant spouse to gain citizenship. Sometimes to allow the military member to gain better quarters - single’s often are assigned to a barracks, this is a way to get base family style housing. All cases deserve scrutiny. In 1957, my parents had to seek the approval of my dad’s Commanding Officer to get married. When I served in the late 70’s, COs stopped a lot of overseas arrangements.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T08:41:55,-14

"U.S. citizens have been molded into a bunch of fat sheep over the last 80 years. A new dictator hits the scene in their own backyard and  gets voted in, twice.  Hah! On top of that , he does his dictator shit and the US  just takes it like a champ while watching their nation implode from the inside.  No one is doing anything and if you haven’t noticed protests just embolden Trump to do more dictator shit.  He doesn’t care what the citizens think.    At this rate enough is never enough and America is a lost cause.",Opening-Dependent512,2025-04-27T11:18:47,0

"Are you saying non-judicial vs court martial in that the latter more “an attack” while the former would be a pre-2025, business as usual response?  I’m inclined to agree with you. But I have seen a number of court martials for lying on an official document or to an official — in the CG specifically. Many of those ‘charges’ usually stemming from the investigation of a bigger, more serious incident but not always. I only say that to offer some hope that if it does go to UCMJ, maybe it’s not political.  Note: I’m assuming you mentioned punishment because of the requirement to report foreign contacts (during clearance investigations or maybe other military screenings). But it’s been a long time since I read the UCMJ and won’t pretend I have a clue on what (else) could be thrown at this guy.  ETA: clarified the note section.",rockbottomgeologist,2025-04-27T10:08:18,3
"I don’t understand the down votes. If the CG member violated the UCMJ or any civilian laws, they need to have the hammer dropped on them.  Thats NOT a Trump vs Harris issue. It’s about the fundamental importance of military discipline. That this isn’t obvious to anyone outside of the military doesn’t invalidate it.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T10:40:15,1

Downvotes might be that you think lower enlisted are too stupid and irresponsible to get married. That might be it. Pog. I imagine you are/were the worst kind of officer.,ChimpanzeeRumble,2025-04-27T17:07:09,3
This service member’s DW may at worst present a security risk and at best represent a breach of good order and discipline. This transcends politics. It was just as valid when Eisenhower was in office as when Trump sits in the Oval Office.,RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T10:43:09,-4
Absolutely… just saying he’s allowing those to stay who benefit him.,Thetrg,2025-04-27T09:09:48,7
"I think that commanders have a duty and a right to do whatever is best for their unit mission. Anything that is a distraction or that may affect readiness, including but not limited to family obligations, needs to be addressed. In fact, the most organized and profitable civilian executives I’ve worked for closely addressed these matters as well. No job or obligation exists for our individual benefit.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-27T17:15:20,-1

"He’s trying to create a slave class. Farmers and hotel workers from other countries would have their lives in the hands of their employers. Those employers would definitely abuse the system to the point of “work without pay, here’s a room where you can stay, act out of line and I’ll deport you”.",thewanderingent,2025-04-27T10:53:30,5
