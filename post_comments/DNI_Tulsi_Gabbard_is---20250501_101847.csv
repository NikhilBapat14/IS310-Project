Unfortunately nothing will happen. That man ruined the lives of so many Americans and we will not see justice. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-01T10:32:47,33

"This admin is big on talk, but I have yet to see handcuffs on one single individual.  Everyone knows Fauci is guilty, f'in arrest him and bring charges.

Biden gave him a pardon so the best we can get is the information of what happened.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-01T11:51:03,-4
Actual justice will never happen.  Go ahead and investigate and figure out what you can.  But let's not play make believe here.  The most we will ever get is the acceptance of his pardon as implied admission of guilt.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-01T11:17:24,-6

"Biden's last-day pardon of Fauci was ""a full and unconditional pardon for any offenses against the United States"" from January 1 2014 through January 19 2025.",mikemaca,2025-05-01T21:24:06,-1
"innocent people who do not knowingly have something to hide have no need in entertaining a pardon..  In order to receive a pardon one must first be convicted of doing something illegal to begin with,this makes this pardon illegitimate..  You cannot issue a “preemptive” pardon for anything,most especially a blanket pardon for a specific time period….  “What if” fauci had murdered someone within that time period….then this blanket pardon would cover it….this is the exact reason preemptive pardons would be unconstitutional to begin with….and they know it but as demonstrated in the past,there is one political party that brushes aside the constitution when inconvenient and cherry picks individual amendments when needed…along with “re interpreting” as needed..  “They” reinterpret to tell us peasants what the founding fathers “really” meant instead of following what’s actually written down..  And…..still…….a lot of people buy into it..  I personally look forward to this and hope it makes the Supreme Court.  ☠️",tsoxiko,2025-05-01T16:56:55,1
Too many liberals are in this sub now. Fauci needs to go to jail for life for lockdown. ,planned_fun,2025-05-02T05:28:54,1
"so is this just a fact finding mission to go after the people under him? where he's been blanket pardoned for like a decade there isn't anything the courts can really hold him accountable for, right?",reaper527,2025-05-01T11:26:14,-11

"There are already significant findings, you clearly haven't read any of the reports. Fauci and his superior intentionally stopped any mention of the Chinese Lab Leak and continued to press for an alternative that they could provide the media in an effort to avoid any potential damage to China globally.    This actively weakened our ability to accurately investigate the origins in a timely manner, it weakened our ability to hold China responsible, and most importantly the facility that had intimate knowledge of the virus that could have helped us identify outcomes, precautions, and vaccines more swiftly was instead ignored by the CDC, NIH, and Fauci's team. This means Fauci's actions directly resulted in prolonged threat from Covid and increased the global death toll.",Zerogates,2025-05-01T12:46:46,153
"Bot comment being upvoted by brigaders. Fuck off. Pharma made its money by all of those who got duped.  Edit: I remember it very differently. Lots of people believed it leaked from a lab in China and cowards like yourself called them racist for that. I also remember that even after learning the risk of spread was minimal to none outside we still had beaches, hiking trails, and parks closed. I remember the fear mongering of a “winter of death”. So once again please fuck off you coward pussy.",McArsekicker,2025-05-01T13:55:42,89

"They clearly mislead the public, even admittedly so, on masks early on. They said not to wear them not because this was somehow the only respiratory virus in history that wouldn't be stymied by a physical barrier, but rather because they didn't want us unimportant plebs rushing out and buying up all the masks so there weren't any left for the doctors (which raises the question: exactly how many of our lives is the life of one doctor worth?)  They also consistently mislead the public to make the virus seem deadlier than it was, by juxtaposing scary numbers of total people who died after testing positive for the virus with images of healthy young people in the hospital, even though the vast majority of the ""deaths"" were extremely old people who died of other things while they happened to have this now extremely common new cold virus in their system.",Res_Novae17,2025-05-01T14:26:36,28
Fauci knew gain of function could lead to this. Thats why they hid the funding. He also knew it came from China but paid off scientists to say it did not.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-05-01T16:37:03,14
"That's an interesting take.  Here's a couple quotes on it from what has been uncovered so far:  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the NIH, told Congress in May that the NIH ""has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" Ebright said: ""**The documents make it clear that assertions by the NIH director, Francis Collins, and the NIAID director, Anthony Fauci, that the NIH did not support gain-of-function research or potential pandemic pathogen enhancement in Wuhan are untruthful**.""  Dude flat out lied to Congress about funding gain of function research in China of all places.  In Wuhan specifically.  Your comment seems to be in regard to ""how COVID was handled in general"".",Merax75,2025-05-01T18:21:50,15

"I would rather spend the resources drafting legislation that makes any sort of ""gain of function"" or any other sort of bio weapon research illegal and if other countries are doing it we ""special forces"" those labs.

We don't have time for this shit unless that really is the plan and I guess we are probably fucked in that case.
