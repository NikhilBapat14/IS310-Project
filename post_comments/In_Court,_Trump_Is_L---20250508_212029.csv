"For Donald Trump, a 5% win-rate is as good as it ever gets.",ranchoparksteve,2025-05-08T21:21:45,44
What’s upsetting is how many losers exist in America that voted for him.,PeaceJoy4EVER,2025-05-08T21:35:07,31
"He’s not trying to win by any definition or metric that will make sense to pretty much anyone on Reddit.  He, or more- they, have a  “plan” for everything. Not that it’s a good one…",The7footr,2025-05-08T21:29:29,12
"And it's time for us to change our default response to him, based on these legal precedents.  Next time he signs some clearly illegal EO blocking funds he's not in charge of, or closing an agency he has no Constitutional role in funding, just point to all of the legal cases and say, ""no"".  ""Nope, you don't have the power to do that, now f#ck off"".  These judges are giving us all license to disobey these illegal executive orders.  Let *him* try to sue *us* instead of us suing to get back rights we never should have given over.",kevendo,2025-05-08T23:00:04,9
"He's a lifelong loser of wars of attrition.  He drags out the losses, calls them successes, and he's sponsored by other people.  Bottom falls out, lather, rinse, repeat.  He is the world's greatest money launderer.",bm1949,2025-05-08T21:32:59,7
"Unfortunately, there is nothing the judicial branch can do if the executive branch ignores its rulings. This is because the former relies on the latter to enforce its rulings.",theimpartialobserver,2025-05-09T00:05:09,2
And yet he still thrives.,shakergeek,2025-05-09T06:53:37,2
So what? If he doesn't like a court ruling against him he just ignores it.     All the judges lack the cojones to hold him or his administration in contempt.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T07:54:28,2

I am stunned they have backed down on as many issues as they have and the courts haven't just handed him the Furhership.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-08T22:19:52,1
Yet he just ignores everything anyway and moves on doing what he wants to while the country is being destroyed.,YakiVegas,2025-05-09T00:11:32,1
"And therefore continue this approach to everything he does because his actions have no legal basis. Also, therefore never compromise with him either.",steve_ample,2025-05-09T00:33:07,1
"Try every idea under the sun, see what sticks, what gets rejected. Refine the ones where there is legal pushback, Either via 'better' ideas, or by changing the laws.",Misfit_somewhere,2025-05-09T00:45:20,1
The fact that he is winning at all is still very problematic.  All this says is that his march towards cementing his authoritarian regime is hitting some speed bumps. Wake the fuck up already!,Random-Name-7160,2025-05-09T03:32:20,1
"Look, there’s a point where that is good. I’m glad the judicial branch isn’t entirely useless.  But if you think any of these decisions will stop the Nazis? You’re crazy. *We* are going to have to stop them. By ballot, or by that Jefferson quote I’ll get in trouble for mentioning. Honestly, probably both.",BalerionSanders,2025-05-09T06:07:44,1
"Too bad that in the courts that really matters most (SCOTUS), he has a get-out-of-jail-free card for the ""Official"" crimes he commits.",phosdick,2025-05-09T06:49:19,1
That has been through his whole life.,tomboynik,2025-05-09T08:07:30,1
"No way!  He’s a winner every time. Just ask any MAGA, they are worn out with all the winning!",Libinky,2025-05-09T08:19:25,1
If he only cared…,Gloomy-Bridge9112,2025-05-09T08:41:53,1
"Trump may be losing in court, but he is ignoring the courts so it doesn't matter.  If the courts don't enforce their decisions, their decisions become irrelevant.",The-M0untain,2025-05-09T08:49:35,1
Bondi has already said Trump has “no need to worry about US Marshalls” which is the only recourse the courts have if someone decides to disobey a ruling.    Really wondering when the courts finally have had enough and actually push this theory to see what happens.,DjImagin,2025-05-09T10:34:06,1
"In other news, water is wet.",AlanShore60607,2025-05-09T11:19:42,1
"Losing doesn't matter if you ignore the courts, refuse to enforce anything they rule about. Welcome to Tyranny.",krustation72,2025-05-09T12:04:01,1
Losing is just what Loser Trump gets to do,Drummal,2025-05-09T14:28:14,1
"Even more upsetting is the number of losers that exist in America that didn't vote at all.  To those that still bitch, ""there should have been a primary"".  Your and even bigger idiot.  Hold your nose, do your part to stop the cult of Trump.  Get back on your ""we need a Primary"" soap box in 2026.",RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-09T05:35:08,8
What’s even more upsetting is how many court losses won’t change much of anything.,checker280,2025-05-09T07:02:41,1
You mean concepts of a plan,mental_dissonance,2025-05-09T02:24:24,1
The problem is his supreme court gave him immunity to criminal charges for anything with the presidential seal on it. So he has free reign to pump out a constant stream of illegal orders. Everybody knows they're blatantly illegal. They don't even try to hide it. But nobody can do anything about it.,ZennTheFur,2025-05-09T02:04:24,3
"You can have done both. I voted, AND I believe there should have been a primary.",MuttTheDutchie,2025-05-09T06:43:14,3
">But nobody can do anything about it.  I mean, the point being made is people should just make him go to court to try and enforce his orders.  He can sign whatever he wants.  Make him prove it's legal.",Cythrosi,2025-05-09T07:09:37,2
"We can do everything about it.  We can refuse. And these judges are giving us validation for that refusal.  It isn't a question of immunity. These aren't illegal acts as in criminal acts, they're illegal as in unconstitutional.  He doesn't have this power.  If someone who wasn't your boss told you you're fired, you wouldn't pack your things and leave. You would tell them to get out of your office.",kevendo,2025-05-09T07:23:05,2
"Same.  I'm an independent who feels our current election process needs ALOT of work as well as how government is monitored and held accountable for checks and balances.  However, I still voted democrat because I researched both candidates and found more wrongs with Trump than most people that have ran in recent years.  People failed to look at his history and his families. They failed to look past the facade that was presented and in doing so their ignorance proved our countries weakest attribute is the inability to look outside their own bias and anger.  They proved our country is filled with people that would leave you dead on the side of the road if it meant they could get a paycheck.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T07:10:36,2
"Yep, but enough losers didn't.  And he is we have our timeline now.",RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-09T06:45:26,1
