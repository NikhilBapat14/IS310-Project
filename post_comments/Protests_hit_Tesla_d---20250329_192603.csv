Why are so many people still on Twitter?,iKangaeru,2025-03-30T06:14:02,3
"The Tesla brand is largely wrecked in the long run. While a few filthy rich MAGA bozos may buy them just to show solidarity with autocracy, most Trump supporters are not the EV type and cannot make up for the international decline in sales.   I'm all for local demonstrations – but at the home state and district offices of GOP senators and House members.   A peaceful but colorful demonstration with 100 people outside (for example) the La Crosse office of Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI-03) is worth 100,000 emails which just go into his spam folder and nobody ends up seeing.",clamorous_owle,2025-03-30T06:41:42,4

"As long as it was peaceful, I'm cool with it. Don't wanna see President Rodent disappear more people just because they tapped a Tesla's Mirror.",Winter-Explanation-5,2025-03-29T21:40:20,3
"I never had Twitter, but from what I've heard it is still, somehow, the better option compared to alternatives. I'm not sure if Bluesky is still growing as fast as it was a few months back, but i guess it's just not there yet.  I say this as someone completely ignorant of both apps, so take it with a grain of salt.",Scottles8605,2025-03-30T14:22:26,2
Blue Sky is definitely still growing and is technically equal to or better than Twitter. It doesn't allow MAGA trolls.,iKangaeru,2025-03-31T07:36:35,1
