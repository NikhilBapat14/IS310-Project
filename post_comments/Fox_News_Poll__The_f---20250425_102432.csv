"""Voters remain gloomy about the economy, as 71% rate economic conditions negatively, and 55% say it is getting worse for their family.""  I wouldn't permit a toddler to drive a car, and I'm baffled as to why we are permitting a toddler to ""run"" the USA & control our nuclear arsenal.

"Really good reminder here that although decent, sane people in this country see the immigration moves as terrifying, the trump admin sees this as their “winning issue” and they will likely press the boot down even harder with data like this that actually shows a net positive there.",ahdidi413,2025-04-25T10:33:59,5

"I think the important number to watch is actually the lowest number. 33% approval (currently on tariffs and inflation, but that's beside my point). That 33% is his deepest base.  If we see 33% break down lower then its **really, really bad** for him. This means he would be losing even his most die hard group. I'd say even something like 28% or 25% would be disastrous for him. Why? Because these polls reflect onto big R donors, senators, and house members. If they see that even the base is eroding they will start to test the waters for defying him. Note that I say ""test"", because if the test receives too much backlash from their base, they will recoil and go back to kowtowing. However, if it works out and they get positive responses even from their base, then they know they can start to turn against this admin.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T10:53:49,2
I’m sure they have people working around the clock to find a way to pin it all on Biden somehow.,Fanticide,2025-04-25T10:54:32,5

I’d be willing to bet that there is a big difference in party affiliation for who agrees with that (republicans more likely to say they are one in the same) and probably explains the difference between immigration and border security numbers in this poll. Not to mention trump admin is deliberately blurring those lines more than ever.,ahdidi413,2025-04-25T11:05:25,1

Can you post a screenshot of 55% approving of his immigration policy? The graph in the article says 48% disapprove and 47% approve.,lalabera,2025-04-25T10:52:25,1
"That's on immigration. Check the second line of the Fox poll image. ""Border Security"" - 55% approve (Blue bar), 40% disapprove (yellow bar).  Its the only issue he has majority approval on in this poll.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T11:01:18,2
I wonder how they got such a discrepancy between two similar topics. Would love to see the wording of the poll,lalabera,2025-04-25T11:03:26,1
"I would say its because the explicitness of ""border"" in ""border security"". Keeping illegal immigrants out and removing non-protected illegal immigrants is generally seen as something that's fine to do. Even Joe Biden had strong deportation numbers.  However, immigration is a much thicker issue. We're talking about a range from protected immigrants who originally illegally crossed/overstayed all the way to legally present students and up to green card holders. Every one of those has been attacked, and the issue gets even worse when you get into rhetoric surrounding wanting to exile US citizens.  There's potentially even sentiments regarding tourism that could spill into that question, as deportations and rejections at the border of regular tourists has gone up and gotten national notoriety.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T11:14:22,1
