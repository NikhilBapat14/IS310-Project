"This is a  Dominion Voting Systems related defamation case in Federal court in Colorado.   There's a specific Dominion employee who Lindell allegedly defamed at length who is the plaintiff.  You may ask rhetorically, if these attorneys are desperate, foolish, impaired by politics, or in far over their heads.    I think it's a mix.  Christopher Kachouroff is lead counsel in the Colorado case, but is a partner in a firm in Virginia that does a little personal injury, a little regulatory and government work, and a little 1st Amendment work just as a treat.  Jennifer Demaster is a little more fun.  You might have caught her star shining brightly when she was fired from the Milwaukee City Attorney's office for poor performance in 2022.   The City Attorney (who would lose his job over sexual harassment and public corruption charges) said it was a coincidence that she was also moonlighting as a Putin apologist on Russia Today, and has published a curious book of anti-Muslim politics and culture.   You might even have caught her appearances on right-wing media revealing her thoughts on terrorist training camps in Mexico, the truth about Jeffrey Epstein, and various Trump topics.  Both Kachouroff and Demaster got their law degrees from Regent University, the one founded by televangelist Pat Robertson.  Lindell can't pay attorneys who aren't politically or religiously motivated to work for him, so he gets.... this.",Aghast_Cornichon,2025-04-25T18:25:28,25
