Yes.   This has been discussed and reported on in the UK since before the tariffs were implemented.  Rumours from alleged UK government sources at the time were that the US weren't interested in fully committing to anything until after the tariffs came into effect so that this administration could parade the deal around as a big win.,Deep_Lurker,2025-05-07T21:57:23,10

To be fair to the UK we've been trying to make a deal with the USA since Brexit. So we're probably not going to have any hangups over wether thhe optics are good or bad for Trump.  The conservatives weren't very good at it because they were too eager for the semblance of a brexit win which gave them a disadvantage in negotiations and weren't willing to negotiate with the EU.v  Labour want deals but they're not as invested in them either. If it's not a good deal they've shown a willingness to walk away as they did with India. They're much warmer to the rest of Europe.  The US under Trump wanted access to UK healthcare and for the UK to lower our produce / meat standards and wouldn't budge on that. Boris Johnson allegedly promised he'd make it happen in private but his government collapsed.   Then Biden just wasn't very fond of the UK in general because he views himself as Catholic Irish. He by no means treated us poorly but there was no special relationship or reverence so the idea of a deal seemed impossible.  Trump on the other hand now is quite eager for a deal to parade as a win and historically he's a bit of a Anglophile with direct ties to the UK and Scotland so this is an opportune moment for the UK government if they actually play their cards right and the reality is it's the UK governments job to do what's best for the UK and a trade deal is good for the UK though until we see the specifics we'll see what concessions were made or if it's a nothing burger.,Deep_Lurker,2025-05-08T06:38:55,2
