60 Minutes continues to show itself to be one of the last bastions of real journalism.,AllynCrane,2025-05-02T10:21:20,192
"""The president is [targeting the Hollywood giant](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5274700-trump-lawsuit-cbs-news/) over a “60 Minutes” segment [that ran last fall](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4920886-harris-60-minutes-interview/) with his political rival, then-Vice President [Kamala Harris,](https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris/) which he argued was edited to cast her in a positive light.""

"'60 Minutes' producer leaves show, citing a loss of journalistic independence   https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/60-minutes-producer-leaves-show-citing-loss-journalistic-independence-rcna202413   >“Over the past months, it has … become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it,” Bill Owens said in a memo to staff members, which was obtained by NBC News. “To make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,’ right for the audience.”   >“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” Owens added.    >Owens’ departure comes during a tumultuous chapter for “60 Minutes.” President Donald Trump has sued CBS for $10 billion over an October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that the president claims was deceptively edited. The network has denied that claim.   >Trump amended the lawsuit earlier this year, upping his damages claim to $20 billion.",tech57,2025-05-02T11:22:59,24

Isn’t 60 minutes the show where folks have been quitting because they’ve lost control over their content? Not sure we can expect the blazing insight we’ve grown to expect.,goodtimesinchino,2025-05-02T11:42:54,15

I hope you’re kidding. These assholes gave that fucker a platform and did nothing to challenge his outrageous take never once fact checking or correcting him.  60 Min is part of the problem and they are only now shifting their approach b/c it is popular.,seattlereign001,2025-05-02T17:46:32,0
"It probably would have been, but CBS execs were trying to get a merger through Trump's FCC. They mistakenly thought that appeasing Trump and settling the lawsuit would get them the greenlight.",saynay,2025-05-02T12:33:29,24
"Iirc, the reason it hasn't been thrown out is because Trump filed the suit in everyone's favorite district in Texas. The lawsuit is currently being presided over by the one and only Matthew Kacsmaryk. ",RuckPizza,2025-05-02T12:49:14,10
> How this lawsuit didn't get immediately thrown out is beyond me. You can sue somebody for saying something positive about someone you don't like?  It hasn't been thrown out because the parties agreed to stay the case. CBS appears to still be considering settlement as an option.,Karmonit,2025-05-03T19:57:29,1
Sadly it goes over most people's heads or they don't have the attention span for it. Sean Hannity yelling hot takes between commercial breaks is more of the average American's speed.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T12:41:08,12
