">President Trump's nominee to be the U.S. surgeon general, the Fox News contributor and family medicine physician Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, has described herself as a double board-certified physician with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine — credentials the president touted in his announcement.  >But those claims about her certification and schooling appear to be misleading.   Misleading? Don't hedge. They're false. They're fake. They lied. Saying Donald Trump is an accomplished amateur golfer is misleading in that he does golf and he has awarded himself numerous accolades regarding the sport. Saying he's a top tier professional golf athlete of the highest caliber is a lie. Same with Dr. Nesheiwat lying about where she earned her medical degree and her board certifications. That's a lie, it's not misleading.",AudibleNod,2025-04-25T12:11:38,33
