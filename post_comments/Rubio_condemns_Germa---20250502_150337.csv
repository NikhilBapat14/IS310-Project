"Rubio condemns German intelligence’s decision to classify far-right party AfD as extremist  Secretary of State Marco Rubio advised Germany to “reverse course” following the domestic intelligence agency’s decision, which grants German authorities increased oversight and surveillance over the party.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned a decision Friday from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency to classify the political party Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a “proven right-wing extremist organization,” calling the move “tyranny in disguise” and advising the country to “reverse course.”  “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD—which took second in the recent election—but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes,” Rubio wrote in a post on X in the hours following the decision.  The decision, announced Friday by Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, gives German authorities increased oversight and surveillance over AfD. While some AfD branches at the state level have received the label — such as in Saxony and Thuringia — this is the first time in modern German history that a party with nationwide representation on the federal level has been classified as extremist. The party won a record 152 parliament seats in the February federal elections and now holds 20.8 percent of the vote.  After conducting a three-year-long investigation into the party, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution released a 1,000 page report, citing violations of core constitutional principles including human dignity and the rule of law.  President Donald Trump and his inner circle have been largely supportive of the AfD. AfD co-leader Alice Weidel was one of many foreign leaders invited to attend Trump’s inauguration and Elon Musk has shown continued support for the party and spoke at an election campaign event for the AfD in January.  “Banning the centrist AfD, Germany’s, most popular party, would be an extreme attack on democracy,” Musk wrote in a post on X.",TheCatInTheHatThings,2025-05-02T15:04:44,18

"Banning AfD is like putting your head into the sand. It will only make their ideology stronger. A new group will arise until the root cause of their popularity is solved. Many Germans are of the increasing amount of immigrants in the country, who often come from hostile cultures and religions to German culture. It is the same reason Reform UK did so well yesterday, and the popularity of right wing parties in France, Italy, and the Netherlands. Denmark tight ended immigration restrictions and the right lost a lot of popularity",TheBlazingFire123,2025-05-02T15:39:32,-3

"This „decision“ has been a political stunt by a politican, Feaser, who has full control of the german intelligence and was voted out of government a couple weeks ago and she has literally three days left in her current role. You don‘t make statements like that if you‘re voted out of office. This Statement also no backing by any court, meaning the only advantage for the lefts in germany is being able to wiretap the currently strongest party in germany: AfD.  „Feaser“ was also made fun of by someone in germany creating a meme with her picture holding a sign „I‘m against freedom of speech“ on twitter / X. That Someone got sentenced to prison for 7 months On probation, because it‘s not allowed to make fun about politicians anymore. This case went into revision, because the punishment of 7 months prison on probation wasn‘t enough for her. It‘s likely that guy who literally only created a meme and posted it on twitter will go to prison. The revision is still ongoing.  Nevertheless, this decision will give the current and new government The power to wiretap the currently strongest party in germany. In conclusion smaller parties who are greedy for power Just have gotten control over the biggest party in germany. Congratulations: This is called „democracy“ in germany.   You can dislike Rubio as much as you want. I don‘t know too much about american politics. You americans enjoy freedom Of speech. Germany has lost it with the new government making „hate speech“ (how is that even defined?) an offense which can send you into prison.   I‘m literally afraid if this post itself is considered „hate speech“. Currently in germany you can get sued for simple posts on the internet where you share your opinion. It‘s likely this post gets reported to a governmental institution and revisioned.  It sounds crazy. But this is what germany has become. we‘re controlled by communists who pretend to be democrats and they surpress the only party who isn‘t left. They literally call out anything against their opinon as being „nazi“.  I‘m certain Donald Trump/ JD Vance will make a statement on this. Germany leading politicians have gotten out of control.",SuccessfulExchange82,2025-05-02T15:44:15,-12
