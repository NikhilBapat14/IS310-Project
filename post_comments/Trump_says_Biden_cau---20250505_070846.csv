"The fact is this:   Most average Americans lack the intellectual acumen to read, much less understand the various economic indicators separately, and how they are interconnected to provide a clear picture.  Jerome Powell was quite clear on our economic growth.  Once supply lines finally opened up post-Pandemic, things did not continue to become less and less affordable. That line is a MAGA -born fallacy.  Gas prices were coming down, consumer goods stabilized, interest -lending rates were finally coming down, wages actually grew.     Most price increases were the result of corporate greed, period.  Go and research the bottom-line of year-end profit reports for major companies like Shell oil, DuPont, Kroger, Chipolte, Panera, Home Depot, Amazon etc.   All posted record blow-out profits from 2022 onward. They all raised prices during Covid, but never bothered to lower them, once things began to open up.  Now many of  those ""average folks"" who thought things were so bad under President Biden, will  surely be witnessing an economic downturn like they have never seen in their lifetimes. All of which will attributable to Donald Trump's glaring stupidity and incompetentence.      I'm talking about foreclosures, loss of employment ( already happening), small-business failures,  decimated 401ks and other retirement plans.  All of this on top of a monumental decrease in/ loss of normal social/societal safety nets ( Hospitals are closing, medical professionals are leaving the USA at a staggering rate; cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP benefits etc).

I firmly don’t believe that anything trump is doing will make life any easier, I’m not a supporter or defender of him or his policy. What I do care about though is that the Democratic Party, instead of speaking to people like me to affirm the struggle we were experiencing and reassure us that it was temporary, regularly came out and told us that things were great.

If a government policy causes a coal plant that has 100 employees making $50,000 a year to close and is replaced by a solar plant that pays 120 people $75,000 a year, you've got 100 people pissed at the government taking away their jobs, and 120 people that don't feel they owe anything to the government for doing anything.

"Both Trump and Biden printed a bunch of money, which of course drives up inflation. But there was no real choice for either of them. Any president would have done so in response to a disaster like covid, because the alternative would be far-worse economic collapse.  Right-leaning working class people are not wrong to think inflation was high during the Biden administration, and still is. They are partially wrong to attribute it all to Biden, but only partially. Where they are completely wrong is in supposing there was any realistic alternative to any of it. But people don't have the tools, free time, education background or often the intellectual curiosity to consider or examine these points. They have talking heads on TV and Tiktok telling them who to blame. Compounding the issue, many are covid truthers who think it was a hoax/the flu/an inside job, so they are unwilling to accept the inevitability of economic impacts from covid.  All of that is leaving aside a more longstanding economic issue, which is that our systems squeeze the working classes for cash and transfer that cash to billionaires. Same as it ever was, of course, but it's much worse since Reagan. That is a real driver of the economic despair of working class Americans, and an exacerbator of the other aforementioned issues. People have no safety nets, poor healthcare, predatory drug and insurance companies, etc. The people to blame for that are of course right-wing and center-right lawmakers.
