"They should go Animal House at the correspondents dinner. Since they're already in double secret probation, they should hold a funeral, complete with a New Orleans jazz band, and a coffin with a journalism effigy. Eulogies to follow. Fuck MAGA if they can't take a joke. And Amber Ruffin is a queen.",brumac44,2025-04-26T07:26:38,50

I’d love for it to just be two straight hours hot young comedians just ripping him apart. The “correspondents” can be there to “report” it.,AAA_4481,2025-04-26T07:57:43,10

Imagine if they used the dinner as an opportunity to tell the truth. Then they wouldn’t need to worry about a wise cracking comedian saying the wrong thing.,Choice_Cup_3624,2025-04-26T07:39:45,6

"Likely there will feature ""their comedians"" who will mock govt workers laid off, tasteless jokes lampooning other governments, how funny it is that children may be getting sent to camps.   Once they get those laughs then they'll laugh at all the voters that voted for them and how dumb they are.   Lame",goderdammurang,2025-04-28T01:31:47,1
"Just for Donny if the need appears to cook a recalcitrant journalist: “To Eat or Be Eaten – A Guide to Cannibalism” by Cascos Chamizo’s work contains handy charts for butchering humans, pages of stats justifying cannibalism, and of course, recipes.",Positive_Owl_2024,2025-04-26T07:26:02,1
Michelle Wolf killed it once before and will have built up an arsenal of ammunition for this one.  It is no laughing matter but I know that she could make the whole room dissolve into a cringing mess.  I would derive some nasty pleasure from this and perhaps even some mirth.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-26T07:48:18,18

"Comedian: President Trump is so brilliant...  Crowd: How brilliant is he?   Comedian: He's so brilliant that when he stared naked-eyed into the eclipse the sun had to shield itself from him!   *STANDING OVATION*    Man, I think I threw up a little in my mouth after writing that.",ClaytonRumley,2025-04-26T10:11:08,7

I'm still disgusted at how they cowardly kowtowed to Trump after Michelle Wolf's set.,cugeltheclever2,2025-04-26T07:42:26,7
"Can we stop this nonsense narrative? The only media this may apply to is Fox, and they are not the ones being scared.

"This is absolute balderdash. It's just a normal centrist paper reporting in a non-partesan manner. I hate Trump too, but the problem with a lot of leftists is that they don't understand the concept of non-partesan. If the NYT ranted at Trump the way you'd want them too it wouldn't be centrist anymore, it would be a left wing paper.",EspressioneGeografic,2025-04-26T12:31:15,2
