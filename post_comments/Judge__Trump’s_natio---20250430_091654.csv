">Even when taken at face value, the judge found that the president’s determinations, which involved shuttling entire agencies outside of the federal sector labor statute when only a mere fraction of their work implicates national security, did not meet the standard that an agency subcomponent must have a “primary function’ of national security in order to be exempted from the law.  >“While the government never explicitly states how it interprets ‘primary function,’ its arguments related to each of the agencies and subdivisions reflect either an overly broad interpretation of the term or a disregard of the term entirely,” Friedman wrote. “The government’s arguments related to each of the agencies and subdivisions illustrate this point by either pointing to generalized mission statements of the agencies referencing national security, or by pointing to individual functions that segments of the agencies or subdivisions perform that have a national security valence, and then concluding that the entire agencies’ or subdivisions’ ‘primary function’ is national security.”",1900grs,2025-04-30T09:17:54,5
