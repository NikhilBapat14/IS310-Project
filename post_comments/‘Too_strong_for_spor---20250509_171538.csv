That’s how scapegoats work. They have to be too strong and must be feared yet so weak that the problem is simple to fix.   It’s Schrödinger trans folk,Fraternal_Mango,2025-05-09T20:10:56,53

"We're too weak, and too strong. We're too sexy, yet repulsive enough to be ""easily identified"". We have an unfair advantage in every sport regardless of physicality, including darts and chess. But, we're too emotionally and intellectually unstable to make our own choices about our own bodies. We are equally the beginning, and the end. Both the alpha and the omega.  It's as though transphobes believe we are everything and nothing, all at once. And, if it weren't being used to disenfranchise us at every possible opportunity?

"So for example -  ""Jesse,"" the cis gender soldier"" can have test shots while deployed for his low testosterone but ""Jesse"" the transitioning female to male can't have test shots while deployed because her low testosterone is divine in nature or something?

"So if you have diabetes or asthma or are in a wheelchair or whatever, you're not allowed into the army. Presumably because you need regular, personalized medical support or risk serious health complications. No one has ever called this discrimination or ableism or whatever. It is simple to understand putting this person in a combat situation puts them and their entire unit at increased risk.  How is someone doing hormone replacement therapy different? Its the same problem. You need 10x more medical attention than any other person.  Don't be so desperate to signal your virtue that you abandon common sense. That is the primary issue in the entire debate.",Lendari,2025-05-10T01:54:30,-18
"Yup. It's part of their genocide. They want to make it seem so that trans people are useless burdens to society. It's the same with RFK Jr attacking people on the autism spectrum.

Except that isn't the primary issue. The reason the administration gave for the ban is they claim trans people violate the military honor code.   And my 10x the medical attention as any other person?

The primary issue is that were no longer having sane conversations because you're so desperate for people to think you're a good person that you've abandoned common sense in favor of virtue signaling to inclusivity at every possible opportunity.  To suggest there is no combat readiness issue is just ignoring the facts you don't like. It is plain to see that if the entire army was on HRT they'd be far less effective than an opposing army that was not. So why make an exception for one snowflake? The practice doesn't scale up. Period. It creates logistical challenges for everyone who has to support the unique needs of this one person and is not in the best interests of overall combat readiness.  You can down vote me but it doesn't  make me wrong. I don't care about your judgement of my character or morals or whatever.,Lendari,2025-05-10T10:37:14,1
I don’t think you’ve ever been in the military. People don’t just get surgeries for no reason in the military. If it’s something that would negatively impact mission readiness and is elective then all you’re doing is compromising mission readiness. If you’re not deployable you get kicked out.   Surprisingly I support removing trans people from the military. All I saw from them in the Army were problems.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T08:54:06,-11
"That policy didn’t just occur, it’s been around for years prior to Trump. Why didn’t Biden or Obama put more pressure on the military? Crazy",gojo96,2025-05-09T22:56:09,-19

and most trans people… don‘t get any surgeries lol  Your transphobia in the rest of the comments you make ensures you are not fit to even comment on this.,Emmystra,2025-05-10T09:03:04,10
Trans people aren't getting surgeries for no reason either.  No one is getting elective surgeries during deployment.,HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-10T09:57:42,3
I’m plenty able to comment on whatever I want. When did I say all trans people get surgeries? Never.   Trans people cause problems in the military because they don’t fit in and they don’t conform. They’re just a headache for all involved. I’m sorry but the army is a literal killing machine and we don’t have time for nonsensical political correctness.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T09:05:46,-16
I think you’re misunderstanding. If you get a surgery with a long recovery time you’re not deployable for that time. Which means you need a very good reason for the surgery. You know like have some pathology that would require a surgery.   For what pathology are these trans people getting surgeries?   My current understanding regarding gender transition surgeries are almost purely psychological. If someone is getting a surgery for those reasons in the military they really just don’t belong in the military at all.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:02:33,0
"Yes, while the truth is that we do fit in, and we do conform. And you just see the handful of ones who don‘t and assume it’s all trans people, which is typical, because for the vast majority of us it‘s a health condition we never mention to those around us. The visible ones are essentially reverse survivorship bias, you only notice the small handful of ones who stand out.  Every trans person who doesn‘t do what you’re saying these people do is invisible to you, they’re some of the men fighting alongside you that you have no issues with. Just look at some articles, generally the people working around these trans people had no idea they were trans until they said something or were forced to discharge from the military. There’s shitty people in any demographic, but you don’t judge all your straight male soldiers for the actions of a handful of terrible drunks or rapists who happen to be in their demographic do you? And we see a lot of those in the military as well.  People, soldiers, are individuals. And it‘s unfair to prevent them from serving their country on the basis of their demographics.",Emmystra,2025-05-10T09:11:29,9
"Oh man, you've got all sorts of dumbass takes. So, as someone who has actually served and whose spouse is still serving, trans people aren't a headache for anyone, and they fit in as well as anyone. Also, the vast majority of service members do not serve in a combat role and will never see combat.",Sebaceansinspace,2025-05-10T09:22:05,8

"I am not misunderstanding. You seem to misunderstand the necessity of any surgery as well that everyone is not up for deployment at all times. Some positions will never be deployed.  Since your concern is surgery, then if surgery was already completed, how is that affecting anything?",HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-10T10:16:38,1
"Were you in the Army? I can only speak specifically on the Army and broadly on the military as a whole. Maybe the cultures different in other branches. So, what do you know two service members having vastly different experiences.   Everyone I know in the Army is either neutral or actively against trans people in the Army. 🤷",Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T09:39:12,-8
Medically disqualifying because they’re clearly not mentally fit for service. If your gender dysphoria is so bad you felt the compulsion to turn yourself into a eunuch I’m going out in a limb and saying that’s at least on par with GAD which is frequently disqualifying for military service.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:28:30,1
Maybe think about those people who are neutral. That is what you should be. Each person should be evaluated on their own merit.,HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-10T09:59:14,5
"Yeah, I mean it‘s essentially a medical condition anyhow, the only really valid stance is neutrality, it shouldn’t be promoted or worked against, just treated. Shouldn’t be a political thing at all, nobody says they‘re for or against testicular torsion lmao, we just treat health conditions.",Emmystra,2025-05-10T10:02:28,4
"Frequently - not all the time. For all issues, you can get waivers if you are stable over a long period of time. If surgery has made you stable, why would you be disqualified?  Also, I am not sure why your fertility is related to military qualifications. If anything, you won't have anyone worried about unplanned pregnancies disturbing their deployment.",HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-10T10:36:36,1
Maybe you’re unaware but there are an entire host disqualifying medical conditions in the military. Including a wide variety of psychological disorders.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:22:23,1
"Yeah, I don’t really want to have to rely on someone who was so mentally deranged they felt a compulsion to remove their own genitals. I’m sorry. The military isn’t fair and it isn’t politically correct. It’s about completing the mission.",Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:41:16,1
"Ok, I am sorry you feel that way. Personally I dont want to have to rely on someone who calls someone mentally deranged for getting medical care.",HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-10T10:54:39,1
