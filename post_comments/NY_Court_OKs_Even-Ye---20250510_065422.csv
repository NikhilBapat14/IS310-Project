"I live in NY.   Odd year elections absolutely favor Republicans.  Republicans can change their terms to be 3 years in local elections, that way they will get odd year elections every other time.  Where I live it will not matter.   The county Legislature has a super majority and it will stay that way - My town has not had a democrat on the boars in over 15 years.  Keep in mind, the Dems say it is about saving money, but our governor was playing games with Elise Stefanik’s seat and force Pres Trump to pull her nomination because she was did want to postpone and have the election further in the future all by itself - which would cost money.   NY’s elections are horrible.  When we got the poll it is reliable, but redistritcing, and election timing is gamed to favor continued control (both sides).",msears101,2025-05-10T07:23:51,8

It seems to me that the whole point of the Home Rule clause is to prevent exactly this kind of situation.,BoredAtWork1976,2025-05-10T10:43:50,2
