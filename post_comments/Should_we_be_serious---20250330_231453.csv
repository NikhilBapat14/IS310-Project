"I don’t know if this will make you feel better or worse, but he’s not the first president we’ve had with concerns about his mental acuity. Woodrow Wilson is a pretty famous example, he suffered a pretty significant stroke in 1919 and the presidency was basically ran by his wife Edith for a year and a half.",ArrogantMerc,2025-03-30T23:28:57,381
"Yes we should. Trump shows obvious signs of mental decline IMO and WAS showing it even during the campaign.

"He tried to alter a weather map with a sharpie to hide the fact that he was wrong about the path of a hurricane. Even a child would know that wouldn't work.

We’ve known he’s unwell since before he descended the fucking escalator. It’s been on display for decades at this point. The producers from The Apprentice saying he wore a diaper and shit his pants on the reg first broke in 2016 and he spoke word salad through his first campaign.  Unfortunately so many people in this country are that fucking dumb that he seemed like a good choice.,DargyBear,2025-03-30T23:27:42,101

His erratic actions and speeches have been a brand signature since the start of his 2016 bid. What truly worries me is how more than a third of this country had mired themselves into an alternative reality bubble that seems to have no redlines too far.,runningwithsharpie,2025-03-30T23:28:09,52

"You should watch the documentary ''Unfit''.  If i remember correctly, it was done after his first term.  Aslo this article is interesting : https://newlinesmag.com/argument/the-mass-psychology-of-trumpism/  Some believe he might have had a stroke : he's dragging a leg, have cognitive issues, and he shows early sign of dysarthria.   Plus, there was the picture of is hand who revealed a bruise that is highly suggestive of an I.V.   On the mental state, he's a typical NPD and APD.  He is highly at risk for dementia (family history, drugs use, is age)   (English isn't my first language, sorry.)",[deleted],2025-03-30T23:23:49,77

"The actions themselves are concerning enough to warrant removal, or at the very least a large clawback of powers away from the president, with at minimum a higher bar for what qualifies as a national emergency and rescinding the powers to unilaterally impose tariffs.  That they could be attributed to cognitive decline is really just justification for removal. You could just as easily go with foreign interference as well.

We should’ve been concerned when he told Zelensky he was messing with WW3.  We don’t call wars by their numbers. Zelensky is already at war so what does he care if it escalates.

Well fortunately it’s not my country but I did read all the comments. Nowhere did I see it mentioned that if The Toddler is deemed to be senile and is removed you get JD Vance.

He’s not even close to qualified mentally to hold the office he does. He strictly speaks in non sequiturs and peppers in as many verifiable lies as he can. Because as he says proudly, I love the uneducated. Because only the uneducated can support someone so clearly in mental decline and who even when he was younger, was never even close to intelligent.

"Trump’s erratic behavior has less to do with his age and more to do with him possibly suffering from more than one psychiatric disorder. I’m not a psychiatrist or psychologist however from my limited understanding and knowledge, it seems to me (and has been widely assumed and reported by others) that he suffers from narcissistic disorder and that he exhibits symptoms that strongly indicate that he is a psychopath. What’s more important is the recognition of his behavior not being normal. The media, his supporters, including the entire Republican Party normalizes everything that the rest of us can clearly see is not normal. And that’s the real issue. Trump is as easily manipulated by others as he himself is manipulative towards others. Many are using him to push their agenda forward, and Trump is happy to assist them. Trumps greatest desire and reward is to be admired and flattered. As others have stated accurately, Trump only cares about Trump.",tongizilator,2025-04-02T06:22:51,3

I'm not sure if he's getting worse. He's been elected and he thinks he's now President for life. He no longer has to try and get votes. He got them and he's going to do whatever he wants.

Note: even if his taxes were under review their was nothing stopping him from releasing them. 4) claiming mexico would pay for a wall.  Blah blah blah  Trump said we should nuke hurricanes.....  Said on fucking stage that people were eating cats..  And so on and so on. He can't even hold onto a thought for long, constantly lies, and so much more.  And america still voted for him a second time. Even though they went nuts about Biden being mentally deranged.. which he was, but Trump is an Egotistical Sociopathic Narcissist, stupid, and incapable of telling the truth.

"I too think he’s seriously losing it.   Trump cannot string a clear sentence together. Try and figure out where he’s going when he talks. You can’t. None of his policies make any sense. He appears to be operating under the assumption that reality will hew to his wishes and commands — like a 5 y.o. who’s convinced he can defy gravity and fly just because he wears a Superman cape. What I don’t understand is how anyone can seriously listen to Trump’s ramblings and still get behind him. Yes, I think he’s genuinely losing it.  As an aside, I’ve known people in their 90s and even 100 who were super sharp. I had a boss in his 80s with an amazing memory. So it’s not just age.

"As a caregiver for someone with dementia, yes, we should be concerned that our president shows numerous signs of cognitive decline and has done so for some time.

Couple the loosening of any moral inhibitions that comes with dementia related diseases with any prior mental illnesses and you’ve got the situation we find ourselves in now.

"Trump is showing very clear and very concerning signs of mental decline frankly. We saw it during the campaign trail when he’d go off into random ass tangents that had nothing to do with what he was talking about before. We see it now with the same thing but also making irrational decisions based solely off his mood at the time it feels like.   Honestly it seems like he’s being pulled around like a puppet and people are just whispering in his ear what they want to see him do. Some of what he does is his own agenda, and other parts are just random nonsense.   The good news is we have built in caveats should Trump really go off the deep end in the form of impeachment & removal and the 25th amendment. The bad news here is that his cabinet is stacked full of loyalists and we all know the people in Congress right now won’t do shit because republicans are scared of him and democrats are too civility pilled to bother right now.  It’s sad honestly. America has a lot of potential and we’re squandering it by electing people who should be in the retirement home to the Oval Office.

"He’s obviously in mental decline but I think his terrible policy decisions can be mostly blamed on whom he surrounds himself with.

He’s also been fucking weird his whole life and not really accepted by the upper crust of society that most people with his wealth would expect. He goes to a correspondents dinner and gets shit on by the current president at the time and the rest is history.   In his first term he was almost as knee-jerk reactionary as he is now but he wanted to be liked/accepted by the people and more importantly the rich and powerful. He’d give into populist demands but if it negatively affected his poll numbers he’d either tweak or backtrack.   This term though he’s been soundly accepted by not just the rich but the obscenely wealthy, the group he’s wanted to be accepted by his whole life.

Then there’s Elon who donated tens of millions to him and has been given extraordinary access to the federal government ever since. He’s been allowed to take a wrecking ball to government agencies, many of whom regulate his companies, been permitted to take part in cabinet meetings, had top secret information shared with him and despite the public backlash to trump he can seemingly do no wrong.   So now that trump has power and has been accepted by the ultra wealthy why would he threaten to pull help from Ukraine, make Canada the 51st state, take control of the Panama Canal and take Greenland? The answer is pretty obvious when you look at his supporters. They’re mostly tech billionaires that need minerals and energy for their products and cheap and secure shipping routes for their products.   Ukraine holds one of the earths largest deposits of LNG. [Up to 900 billion cubic metres](https://www.trade.gov/energy-resource-guide-ukraine-oil-and-gas#:~:text=Ukraine%20has%20tremendous%20natural%20resources,ranks%20second%20for%20gas%20reserves.) along with myriad other mineral and oil deposits. Trump getting a deal signed to allow Americans to exploit those deposits has the potential for trillions of dollars worth of assets and wealth to flow back to his energy supporters. If a deal doesn’t come through then he makes a deal with Russia that the US won’t interfere with the rest of the war so long as they can get some mining companies in there afterwards.   Canada is the third largest landmass with huge swathes of soft and hardwood timber, oil, copper, coal, gold, diamonds, uranium and rare earth minerals. They also control the arctic which is going to be a valuable trade route once global warming truly takes hold.   The Panama Canal is an important trade route, especially for goods being shipped from Asia to the west coast. Keeping shipping costs down would be huge for the Apple’s and Walmart’s of the western world.   Finally there’s Greenland. They have one of the worlds largest [untapped resource deposits. ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/greenlands-rich-largely-untapped-mineral-resources-2025-01-13/) From iron to nickel to uranium to rare earth minerals. With the EV market coming in in full force now and the CEO of the worlds most valuable EV company having unfettered access to not just trump but the entire federal government it’s not hard to see why he wants it so badly now.   He’s almost definitely demented but even in his first term he was known to take the advice of the last person he’d talked to. Now he’s surrounded by the extraordinarily wealthy like he’s always wanted and they’ve done a good job to make sure they’re always in the room and always some of the last people he talks to before a policy is proposed. He’s what he’s always been, a useful idiot.",AlbertaNorth1,2025-03-31T17:47:14,1

"I definitely feel we should be concerned that Trump is back in the White House in general. As far as cognitive decline is concerned, anyone getting close to being  80 years old is going to experience a certain amount of slowing down mentally. Reagan and Biden both showed signs of slowing down  while in office. But both men had the common sense to listen to advisors and military leaders before making major decisions.  Trump on the other hand, knows absolutely everything about everything (except when he has no knowledge of a mistake of his or one of his staff.)  He’s convinced that he’s the smartest guy in the room, so why should he listen to advice. Narcissism aside, videos of Trump’s speeches, where there is rambling, no continuity, context, slurring and swallowing, are plentiful. But now that he has immunity, there is nothing that can be done about any of his bonehead policies. He is definitely declining cognitively. But he seems to be fueled by vindictiveness and ego. He sure hasn’t forgotten how to look for revenge. It’s one thing to be slowing done. But if you still have enough presence of mind to go after enemies, imagined or otherwise then that’s dangerous.

"There are two parts to this question.   Firstly, can his behaviour be attributed to pre-existing mental disorder?   Secondly, is he also suffering from cognitive decline?   1. It’s beyond doubt that Trump suffers from Narcissistic personality disorder. This has been widely covered and you’d be very hard pressed now to find a psychiatrist to say otherwise.   As to how that disorder affects his behaviour, Vlad Vexler has an interesting and compelling (albeit terrifying) breakdown here:  https://youtu.be/cmTeg0B9tH8?si=TIJNMUduXFi7r5o5   2. Everybody suffers cognitive decline to a greater or lesser extent as they age. That’s just biology. Whether Trump has reached the point where he should be removed from office for being unable to perform his functions (for that reason alone) is rather more speculative. It’s certainly a legitimate question, but very hard to prove.   However in practical terms that would require impeachment and there are far better and more certain legal grounds for impeaching him (and Vance) under the constitution and federal law than that.   Adding his mental health to the grounds of impeachment would just muddy the waters and therefore be counterproductive. Very counterproductive. Steer clear.

That is a very complex topic with a lot of room for nuance, but Trump hears that and his immediate thought is “we need to take Greenland”. I also wouldn’t be surprised if some of the animosity he’s throwing towards Canada is related.   Does the US need to build up a strong presence in the arctic to counter Russia and China? Yes.  Does that mean we need to “buy” or take over Greenland? Obviously not. I constantly get attacked from both sides for saying this, but the fact of the matter is this was being talked about in military and geopolitical circles for a while now and it had nothing to do with Trump.

"Yes, and his staff is struggling to hide it.  Because there were so many complaints that Joe Biden didn't do a lot of press availabilities, and this led to the criticism that he wasn't doing anything, the Trump White House has hit on this idea of having him do a lot of small availabilities. Americans are mostly seeing him in the Oval Office signing shit or swearing people in or sitting down with a visiting leader. That makes him look very active, the same way his campaign rally schedule -- no matter how disastrous they became -- made him look like he was campaigning harder than Harris.   But at these near-daily events, you can see how much his verbal range has diminished. You can see the endless obsessing over past indignities. His energy level is generally low, and he often seems checked out and occasionally even disoriented (for example, when he walked out of a swearing-in ceremony without doing the swearing in).   Even now that the White House pool reporters are being winnowed down to friendly outlets that pitch him the most cottony-soft softballs imaginable, he often can't answer them. He's either not being briefed by staff OR can't retain the information.  In short, Trump on a good day is....not good.

You should be concerned that this isn't a result of dementia and the gop congress knows it and is going along with it.   Look up the Butterfly Revolution. This is part of their playbook. Making power plays so fast and so many it makes our head spin that we don't even know what to focus on. Plant red herring headlines out there to make us distracted while they continue to grab at power and dismantle the government from the inside and plant loyalists in their place.   Dismantling the government, alienating us from our allies, breaking modern governments so the technocrat billionaires can rebuild in their image is the goal.   If you think about it from that angle it all makes sense.   They believe they are being stifled by regulations and prevented from reaching their true potential. If we break it and rebuild it then think of the possibilities.   Peter Thiel who bought JD Vance's VP seat has been looking for a place for billionaire tech giants to live away from current governments. First he wanted to do it on a floating city, now he has a virtual community made up already they just need the land to do it.

Who determines the criteria? Who administers the test? Who evaluates the results?  End of the day no party will agree to it because there is no way to do so in a 100% objective manner that removes any and all opportunities for partisanship.  The simpler solution imo is to just establish an age cutoff based on long established criteria. For example ""Average Life Expectancy as of the last sentence, minus 10 years.""  Life expectancy can't be artificially influenced by partisanship - unless it directly impacts all Americans - except by policies meant to extend or reduce life expectancy.  The census tracks this data and has for decades.  And reducing by 10 years means less chance of politicians lingering on death's door in office like Feinstein or McConnell.  I'd even expand it to no candidate may run for office if they will hit that age during the term, and establish it as mandatory retirement age for federal judges, Supreme Court Justices, and political appointees.

"Think how long it has been since we expanded our border after the Mexican-American War when Texas was annexed - 1845-1848. When Trump said he wanted to ‘take America back’, most people assumed it was to the 1950s. Segregation was still around and he has been spitting out racism first by not renting to POC, going after the Central Park 5 and culminating with Obama being born in Kenya. In his first term he elevated ringers to the Supreme Court to take away women’s rights over their own bodies,  and now there are even states trying to take away no-fault divorce. But trying to threaten ‘taking Greenland ‘ militarily if necessary - he is taking us back to 1845! Next up is destroying the 1787 Constitution- which, let me remind everyone that each and every Congress person, Judge and military service member takes an oath to uphold. GOP Congress and more than a few Judges are relinquishing that oath to an unstable, elderly, failed businessman and  convicted felon along with the richest man in the world who does not qualify to be president, so he bought his way in by buying the convicted felon.

"It looks to me that it was less increased support for Trump and more decreased support for Biden/Harris. Generally less votes were cast, and Harris lost 6 million votes compared to Biden in 2020.   The reasons are mainly his economic policies which many perceived as not helping financial woes, dissatisfaction with the status quo, and Biden’s actions in the Gaza War.   Trump promised economic prosperity while Biden insisted everything was just fine when for many it very much wasn’t, by promising to curb inflation. Additionally, Biden’s support for Israel was widely condemned by the progressives, who went as far as calling him “Genocide Joe.” Harris did not distance herself from Biden’s policies at all. Combined with a general global trend against incumbents, and the result is a matter of record.   One can say to those who voted for Trump that “they voted for this” and be technically correct, but some of the policies he’s currently doing such as talk of invading Canada and Greenland was not present. Heck, even Project 2025 didn’t have that written down, and it had a lot of the things he’s doing now in it. As unpopular as this would be, I don’t think most who voted for Trump want what’s going on now, and that’s evidenced by the unpopularity of Republican officials and congressmen who are finding themselves voted out of office as well as the fact they don’t attend town halls anymore because of the backlash.   I think many including myself would agree that America feels unwell. The protests, which not only include peaceful demonstrations but also include consumer boycotts of Musk and affiliates, are only growing in number and frequency. What I find most striking is that there’s a lot of older folks out on the picket lines, which is a demographic which generally votes Republican and universally doesn’t tend to show up to protests.

The original question, ""Who engaged in insurrection?"" is valid. Yes, January 6th was a tragic event, and everyone involved should be prosecuted, not pardoned, but it wasn’t an insurrection.   The individuals involved weren’t trying to overthrow the government, they believed the election was corrupt and wanted what they thought was a fair process.  This was all a after effect of the election fraud cases.  Trump couldn’t get a fair hearing in his election fraud cases because of the intense political polarization and the climate surrounding the election. The legal challenges were viewed by many as politically motivated, which made it hard to get impartial hearings.   Additionally, the petitioners of a case face significant challenges in gathering evidence without the court’s help, as courts don’t typically conduct investigations or assist in collecting evidence. The evidence Trump had access to without a court order was limited to public information.  This, along with the public pressure and disinformation surrounding the election, made it nearly impossible for Trump to receive an unbiased hearing, no matter what evidence was presented.   All of this fueled a strong belief that the election was rigged, disenfranchising millions of Americans. Had the Trump cases been fairly tried and no evidence found, January 6th would never have happened.  While many want to blame Trump and label it an insurrection, the true fault lies with the legal system for failing to address questions about the election, which led to a mob of idiots attacking the capitol in what they believed was a attempt to save the country not overthrowing the government.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-03-31T14:57:33,-4

"Yes, credible questions were indeed raised. Over half of the cases were dismissed for ""lack of standing.""  When a court dismisses a case on the grounds of ""lack of standing,"" it simply means that the person bringing the case, in this instance, Donald Trump, did not meet the legal requirements to challenge the election results in court. However, this does not imply that there was no fraud or that any claims related to fraudulent activity were proven to be false. A dismissal based on standing refers specifically to the procedural aspect of whether the individual has the legal right to bring the case forward, not a judgment on the merits of the allegations themselves.  In other words, while the court may have determined that Trump did not have the legal standing to contest the results, this decision does not address the actual substance of the claims being made. The court did not rule on whether fraud occurred or not. Standing is a threshold legal requirement, and the court's dismissal simply means that the case was not able to proceed under those specific legal conditions. It doesn't rule out the possibility of fraud, it just means that the person bringing the case wasn't in the right position to argue that particular issue in this instance.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-02T08:02:33,0

"One notable case that fits is Texas v. Pennsylvania, filed by the state of Texas in December 2020. This case is significant because it raised claims of election fraud in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, specifically challenging the manner in which those states conducted the 2020 election, particularly concerning mail-in ballots and other processes.  The case involved Texas suing the four states, arguing that they had violated the U.S. Constitution by making changes to election procedures (like mail-in ballots and other measures) that were inconsistent with laws passed by state legislatures. Texas claimed that these changes violated the ""equal protection"" rights of voters in other states, especially Texas. In the lawsuit, Texas requested the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate the election results in those four states and to appoint special electors to cast votes for Trump.  The lawsuit referenced a variety of claims, including allegations of fraud and irregularities in how absentee ballots were handled and counted, particularly in Democratic-leaning urban areas. The legal team also presented affidavits and witness testimonies in an attempt to establish a case for widespread voter fraud.  However, the case was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court not on the merits of the fraud allegations but because Texas did not have standing to bring the case. The Court ruled that Texas could not demonstrate a direct injury to its own rights that would justify its involvement in challenging the election results in other states. The Court concluded that Texas, as a state, could not claim to have been harmed by the election procedures in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia.  Had the Supreme Court not dismissed the case for lack of standing, the evidence presented would have led to further investigation into the claims of election fraud in the contested states. Some of the affidavits and witness testimonies would have prompted inquiries into the handling of ballots and voting procedures. However, because the case was dismissed before any substantive hearings on the merits could take place, those allegations were not investigated further in the legal process.  The dismissal of Texas v. Pennsylvania highlights how procedural issues, like standing, can prevent courts from addressing potentially substantial issues raised in lawsuits. In theory, if the case had been allowed to proceed, the evidence would have been subjected to a full investigation and legal examination, leading to a deeper probe into the election processes in the contested states.  This case also illustrates the difficulty of challenging election processes across state lines. The Court found no legal precedent for allowing a state to sue another state over its election procedures, which is why the claims did not move forward to an investigation.   Texas v. Pennsylvania is a key example of a case where evidence related to potential election fraud or irregularities was not investigated because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, preventing an in-depth examination of the claims.   There may have or may not have been election fraud but there was never a determination either way. Out of the 60 cases filed for election fraud 39 were dismissed in this manner.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-02T10:18:49,0

"You seem to be focusing on Trump rather than the actual cases filed. While I have mentioned Trump, it’s only used in an anecdotal context to reference the cases.  It also appears there’s some misunderstanding regarding the rules of evidence and standing. In the case of Texas v. Michigan, sworn affidavits were submitted by poll workers, where they testified that they had personally witnessed fraudulent voting, specifically, votes cast by deceased individuals and instances of multiple voting. However, the court dismissed these affidavits because they did not provide the specific names on the ballots they claimed were fraudulent. As a result, the affidavits were not considered concrete evidence.  A major issue here is that, legally, poll watchers are not allowed to record names or take notes on the ballots they observe. This presents a challenge for providing concrete evidence, because without specific details or the ability to gather and record such information, affidavits remain generalized.   The court stated that if any ballots were incorrect, they should have been corrected on the spot before being counted. The poll workers’ affidavits claimed they were ignored, and the ballots were counted anyway. Some affidavits stated that upon protest of a ballot they were removed from the building and no longer allowed to observe the counting.   You ask for specific evidence but when witness testimony was presented the courts declined taking any further action to either verify or validate the claims and simple stated, since you can't give me a specific name on a ballot it does not count.  It's also important to note that in a recount, ballots are not re-verified for validity, they are simply recounted. Any vote that has made it through the initial verification process is considered validate for all subsequent recounts.  When it comes to a lawsuit of this nature, it is the plaintiff's responsibility to provide solid evidence. However, the issue here is that the plaintiff does not have the means to directly access the necessary evidence. They are relying on the court to issue subpoenas and conduct investigations. So, while the plaintiff may need concrete evidence to make their case, they often cannot acquire that evidence until the court orders an investigation or further action.  As for standing, the courts absolutely got it wrong in Texas v. Pennsylvania. The court ruled that Texas did not have standing because they could not demonstrate how they were directly harmed by the actions of the other states. The harm described was considered indirect, meaning the court determined that Texas could not show a specific, direct injury caused by the election results. For legal standing, a plaintiff must show a direct and tangible harm, and in this case, the court did not find that Texas met that requirement.   Example: If your candidate does not win a election it does not show how you have lost money or been harmed. Although that candidate may later act in ways that does financially hurt you, it has not happened yet, so is not direct harm.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-03T10:58:08,1
