"Over the past few decades, too many people in the US decided it wasn't worth the money (or too 'socialist' or something) to have good public libraries and good community centers with facilities and activities for kids.

"So in your brain, telling Trump he can‚Äôt deport people, and US citizens, because we have due process‚Ä¶is the right thing because of the constitution.
