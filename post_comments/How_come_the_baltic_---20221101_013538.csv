"The break-up of the Soviet Union was not peaceable; the security forces in many of the central Asian countries were used to put down protests and ensure that the Communist officials remained in charge even after the end of communism and the Union. The presidents of Azerbaijan (Heydar Aliyev), Tajikistan (Rahmon), Turkmenistan (Niyazov), and Uzbekistan (Karimov) are or were all former communists that maintained a Soviet-style security state, and built cults of personality to replace the state's now-defunct ideology.  As for the Baltics, Czechia, Hungary, and Poland all have comparable GPD per capita (not in the USSR but in the Warsaw Pact). Certainly the old GDR would be considered a successful and wealthy country. Fair to say the first two are not in the Russian sphere of influence. The nature and character of the independence movement and action is critical (did Soviet military intervention against liberalisation succeed or fail), and the proximity to Europe the culture, Europe the market is important as well.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-11-03T20:25:55,2
