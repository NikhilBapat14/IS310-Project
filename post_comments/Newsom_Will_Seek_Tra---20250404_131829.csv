"""Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is trying to get around President Trump’s tariffs to protect trade in a state with the world’s fifth-largest economy, asking his administration on Friday to pursue new international trade deals to exempt California products from any retaliatory tariffs.  Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, called on foreign governments to exclude items made in California from any actions they take in response to the tariffs Mr. Trump announced this week.  “Donald Trump’s tariffs do not represent all Americans, particularly those I represent here in the fifth largest economy in the world, the state of California,” Mr. Newsom said in a video announcement. “California is a stable trading partner and we hope you remember that as you consider California-made products.”",Lebarican22,2025-04-04T13:20:23,79

This was my exact thought.  Other countries a should exempt states that didn't vote for Trump to dissuade his followers from voting for his type again.,WarLawck,2025-04-04T15:31:55,7

"It would be an interesting move for CA to claim its ports are now under CA jurisdiction—sort of a twist on what Texas did with the border.  Argue that the tariffs have created an economic emergency, and the Fed is failing to protect the state.  Maybe try locking the customs agents out of the ports.  Force Trump and the Republicans to now argue against states' rights.  Take it to the SCOTUS.  It will almost certainly fail. But it could be a big political win and keep the spotlight glaring on Trump and the Republicans as the root causes of this disaster.",Snoo_17338,2025-04-05T12:45:44,3

Talk with Canada. They're open to this kind of proposals. They targeted Trump voting red states specifically when first tariffs were announced. I'm sure Canada would be open to this.,KathyJaneway,2025-04-04T19:34:06,23

I'm unclear what he's doing. He can't exempt imports from tariffs because it's federal policy. He's just asking trading partners not to retaliate out of sympathy?,handsoapdispenser,2025-04-04T18:18:15,1
