"It is simple, unless they are service animals.  Otherwise a cat or dog or whatever should NOT be in school. You don't bring your pets to school and they certainly don't go there on their own.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T17:07:16,3
"The problem is that so many furries are service animals, usually servicing each other.  They can be good pets if that's your thing, but most could probably be considered feral, and very few have been spayed or neutered.   They go to schools or anywhere else they wish to go, sometimes in packs. They have been known to also travel long distances to congregate, with several yearly migration points, but usually return to their regular territory after a week or less.  You can usually tell they are around with their distinctive ""Yiff"" mating call, or the scent of cloves. They can be easily lured with jars of Nutella or salty snacks.",Faelwolf,2025-05-01T20:13:35,1
