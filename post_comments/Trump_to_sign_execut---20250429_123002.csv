"What a mess.  Remember when Republicans mantra was ""Get government out of the way of business""?  Now they're trying to micro-manage sectors with incoherent tariff policy.",zubbs99,2025-04-29T12:37:50,10
Titles like this are why Trump got elected again.    If this was a democrat it would read something like:  “Biden backtracks on tariffs he created. Does he even know what he is doing?”,1llseemyselfout,2025-04-29T12:46:59,8
">The executive order Trump is expected to sign allows domestic car manufacturers to be reimbursed for the 25% tariff on auto parts, senior Commerce Department officials told reporters on Tuesday, to a maximum of 3.75% of the value of domestically produced cars, the officials said. That will be phased out over two years.  It looks like they got worried after a number of ""car assembler"" plants fired workers. So, they're capping the tariffs on parts to a fairly low percentage.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-04-29T12:31:38,3

"The current free trade agreement between Canada and the US that includes no auto tariffs at all was negotiated by... you guessed it, the Trump administration!  This merely proves that his word is worth absolutely nothing.  Any nation that is wise will avoid any agreements while Trump is in office.  Making commitments based upon his promises would be suicidal.",I405CA,2025-04-29T13:30:19,2

"Can someone Explain this like I'm 5. I work for the auto industry and this directly affects me. We have tarrifs, wait no we don't, now we do I can't keep up.",pagenath06,2025-04-29T14:54:41,1

"They’re not “capped” in the way most are gonna think when they see this. The more cars these manufacturers produce domestically, the bigger “discount” on tariffs they’ll receive. There’s effectively no change",CampSlight9070,2025-04-29T12:33:47,2

"Ah, I seem to have misread that. It looks like the reimbursement amount is capped instead. But they are reimbursing the all the tariff of parts up to that cap, it seems. At least for the next couple of years, cough, midterms, cough.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-04-29T12:37:22,3
