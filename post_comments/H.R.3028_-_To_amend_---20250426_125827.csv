"I'm guessing that if a prior order raised tariffs on codes for Whiskey, then McConnell can ""update"" the codes for Whiskey so that the tariffs don't apply to products tagged with the new codes",snowdrone,2025-04-26T14:52:50,3
Seems extremely specific.,jtsa5,2025-04-26T14:06:44,3
"This affects products entering the States, not going out. Right now, 2208.30 is the heading for all whiskies, which is then split between two groups, Irish/Scotch whiskies, then bourbon/rye/other. All groups are further divided between containers 4 liters and under, and those over 4 liters. (There is a old HTS temporary code for extra tariffs on UK-sourced Irish/Scotch whiskies that expired in 2021).  This bill may be a nothingburger, or more hilariously, an uninformed non-attempt to protect targeting on bourbon. Change to the HTS does not affect tariffs by other countries, which use their own import coding system.",themaninthehightower,2025-04-26T15:23:14,2
What is the purpose of this / what does it mean?  Would this make it harder for countries to implement retaliatory tariffs targeting KY whisky?,DataDude00,2025-04-26T14:47:10,1
"Even if they manage to pass this, Hegseth isn't going to do his job any better.",Tballz9,2025-04-27T12:40:51,1
But then other countries could just update their tariffs to include that number as well? I donâ€™t think that would make any sense,_DragonReborn_,2025-04-26T15:00:41,3
"Canada isn't bothering to import Kentucky bourbon at this point so the turtle can change the codes as much as he likes, your not going to find it on our shelves.",biscuitarse,2025-04-26T18:36:50,3
"Is it to target specific whisky/whiskey? Canada is not inporting Bourbon so I could see them targeting our rye, but the UK is not doing retaliatory tarrifs so maybe coding theirs differently.",Lostinthestarscape,2025-04-27T01:40:45,1
