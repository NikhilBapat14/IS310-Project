Sure, but that's not their normal ballpark.  The easiest thing he could garnish is anything come from the feds - tax refunds and government benefits.

"It’s so absolutely fucked that Republican voters will support this because none of the toothless yokels have student loans.   I can talk about this infinitely, but the PSLF program was signed into law by George W. Bush in 2007. It had nearly unanimous bipartisan support. Nobody said a fucking word about it until 2017, when the first wave of eligible borrowers were up to have their loans forgiven, then MAGICALLY it “wasn’t fair” to people who had paid theirs off already.   Who, pray tell, was the President in 2017? And who was the Sec of Ed? That’s right folks - two people who have never paid a loan in their lives, and couldn’t balance their personal bank accounts on their own if their lives depended on it. These people were now in charge of the biggest student loan relief program in the history of our country, and they LITERALLY broke the law with the way they mishandled it.   The PSLF program was so fucked until Biden finally did something about it in 2021, and of course scumbag Republicans did nothing but fight it. They had NOTHING to say until money actually started making it back into regular people’s pockets, and now they have gone out of their way to fuck people over again.

If you ask me, students who borrowed as teens and early twenty-somethings have a much better excuse for bad financial decision making than the reckless mortgage borrowers of the 2000s who were often mid-career.

"> I think it's because Fox News tells them what to be upset about and they bring out the pitchforks on command, rather than thinking clearly.  There's some of that, but there's also their hierarchical mindset.  Its possible you may have heard this before, but it bears repeating: conservatives don't believe in an equal playing field. I don't mean it like they hate the idea. I mean they legitimately believe there is no such thing as an even playing field, and any attempts to create it are putting your fingers on the scales of fate. In their mind, there are the successful and there are the failures. The successful are *only* successful because they worked harder or are in some way just **better** than the rest. Similarly, if you're poor, or ugly, or homeless - its your own fault. get a job, pay for your education, go to the gym, what have you; and your failure to remedy this makes you a societal failure.  As a corollary, then, they have a strong sense of paying your due: ""I paid my way through college, and so should you"". So any world where your debt to 'society' is repaid is - you guessed it - putting your thumb on the scales of fate. It elevates your rung higher than it aught to be.

"It’s a predatory system. 17 year olds face a lot of pressure from their family, friends, counselors, teachers, and society at large to go to college and get a degree. Not just any college, but the best one you can get into. The propaganda was immense. You wanna support a family and have a stable career? That’s how you do it.   Kids are not taught well-enough in schools about it how interest works in loans. Many don’t fully understand the ramifications of the money they’re borrowing. The loan agreements are in legalese. Plus, a lot of kids don’t have financially literate parents to guide them through it.   Then they take out all these loans for the degree they were pressured into getting, and the job market is terrible and wages aren’t keeping up with the cost of living. All while they’re paying the due monthly payment and it’s not even covering the interest.   This isn’t people blowing off car loans or layaway payments. They got scammed into an “education” they were told was a prerequisite to success.   Many of us believe it’s far more important to let them get on stimulating the economy with that money rather than funneling it to banks or treasuries who hold the loans, especially when the government is pissing money away on trillion dollar fighter jet programs and military parades.

"Nothing I'm about to say aims to invalidate anything you said (which were all good points, and all true, though I don't know that I have the same expectations about a subsequent administration's efforts to fix the problems). But higher ed recruitment/admissions is a predatory thing that has left a lot of people with an understandably bad taste in their mouths. In many ways, it's a race to the bottom, with the oversaturation of two- and four-year schools that inevitably annually raise tuition costs, not necessarily to keep track with inflation, but to justify increases in some seriously top-heavy bloat. They're as capitalist as any conglomerate, and they need to make that line go up if the ever-growing academic C-suite are going to maintain their opulent lifestyles.  There are a lot of people in this country that would have been a lot better off going to trade schools, and forgoing a university education that they had no chance of completing, not because they're dumb or anything like that, but because the higher ed paradigm just isn't the right fit for them. And those people are making those life-altering decisions when they're young, aspirational, impressionable, and have no f'king clue what they're getting themselves into in terms of financial burden. To be paying off student loans with your job in your degree's field is one thing. To be paying off student loans with your job you took because you had to drop out and work full time to pay rent, well that's a special kind of fucked up. And that's a scenario that happens all day long, and every college is fully aware of, make no mistake; they just don't say that part out loud.  Add on top of that so many universities lowering admission standards and cannibalizing trade schools specifically for the purpose of staying attractive, and increasing enrollment and formula funding, and you've got a perfect storm where there aren't a lot of alternatives for a lot of people. Go to college and get in debt and hope you can get out, or don't, and hope you can get licensed and then get work in a trade field. Or don't do either of those things and take a minimum wage job because ya sure as f'k aren't getting anything in manufacturing or agriculture.  I don't want to sound like I'm devaluing a college education here. It was the best decision I ever personally made, hands down (except for probably buying a house during the Obama years when interest rates were bottomed out, but that's a whole other sort of conversation). But higher ed is making no efforts to temper people's expectations. They're selling them the dream, with a nice hefty interest rate, while their own losses are subsidized by massive federal assistance.  And so, I suppose, while I can't (won't) validate the feelings of someone spitting on someone else's misfortune, I also take no satisfaction in knowing that many of those selfsame people were drawn in by a culture that had no interest in disabusing them of the fact that the college path might not have been the right one for them.  Whole lotta blame to go around, and there are a lot of ""victims"" of higher education, is what I'm sayin'. People content with their lives don't go around talking shit about other people. They're busy being content with their lives.

"> People vehemently against student loan forgiveness tend to imagine doctors, lawyers, etc.  I mean the numbers being kicked around was a modest 10k/20k by Biden, which would help most student loan holders for sure, but wouldn't even make a dent in the loans for someone with a doctorate. Even the notion of up to 50k that was tossed around would only help so much.  I don't think it's about the amount, we could reduce it to $1k forgiveness and they would still cross their arms and pout.

It's about finding fault with the borrower for what they went to school for, or why they didn't try to figure out how they would pay loans back, or whatever other reasons the borrower isn't worthy of help over. It's about punishment for perceived flaws or bad behaviors.  There's a far greater discussion to be had about whether the student loan system is moral, just, equitable, or what kind of effect it has on entire generations of people, families, or the economy at large. Admitting the system is fundamentally broken requires admitting people were victims of that system, and that victims need help making them whole again.

"The Boomer issue in America is unique from the rest of the world in that its a conservative movement/mentality without traditional establishments to reference. Other countries and societies have over a millennium of history/culture/religion/royalty to define and justify social hierarchy when marketing conservatism, yet America was founded on upsetting social hierarchy (defying monarchy for \[relative\] democracy and rejecting a state religion). The ""pride"" of the USA -- what citizens and politicians celebrate, what we claim makes America great -- include the Revolutionary War, religious freedom, Abolitionism, Women's Suffrage, Labor Rights/Unions, Civil Rights, modern concepts of individuality: all of them *progressive* movements and concepts which *disrespected* traditionally established hierarchy.  While Hippie culture did exist, Reagan convinced *the majority* of Boomers \[as well as a good number of their parents\] that money was the new royal blood, that such was promoting individuality and a hierarchy of *merit* rather than circumstance (such as blood), that they were impoverished lords and only needed to work hard and obtain more money to receive the privileges of a lord. Conversely, many of the Silent Gen who fought for labor rights and social infrastructure were tied down by their own biases and bigotries, and thus voted for Reagan when the latter convinced them that those whom they were bigoted towards were benefiting from progressive policies (""welfare queen"" rhetoric immediately comes to mind).  Their ""comfort zone"" is entitlement, in the form of ""I'm old, so I'm above you in social hierarchy, which means you must defer to *my* values/feelings/whims/desires/rhetoric/etc."" It's the very ""participation trophy"" they whine about kids receiving, because -- as hierarchy dictates -- only *they* are allowed such, not those they consider socially inferior.",Shido_Ohtori,2025-05-06T12:16:32,13

Ignoring anything else, it just isn't a good policy both for garnering support or for helping the economy.  To other reasons now. Other first world (and even developing nations) have free college. Why? Because if your population is well educated, society advances far faster. You have a population that is educated, they're able to do tasks far better, they're able to develop products, services, etc far better. It really isn't that hard. As a nation, you want to invest in your population. One of, if not the best way to do that is by having them educated. Want to know a perfect example? Look at China before and after their revolution. Before, single digit literacy rates, farmers, country did jack shit. Post revolution when they provide education? Rocket ship to the moon in terms of advancing their society.

"I think it’s not that people don’t like their choices, the choices were theirs to make. However most people do see the inherent unfairness of using other people’s money to pay back someone’s debt. I’d be all for making the universities rebate money based on the lack of value they provide but why should taxpayers, who had absolutely no say on the entire process, have to foot the bill? It’s such a weak argument. The Obama admin stepped in and took over all student lending to insure everyone could get financing regardless of ability to repay. The schools capitalized on this new glut of students wanting to attend with fat stacks of government money. They quickly increased their tuition up to the amounts covered by guaranteed loans and well in excess of inflation rates. Then when the whole Ponzi scheme falls apart, people are somehow pissed at the people just going about their lives because they aren’t supportive of bailing adults out from their personal debt. Such a dumb take. Everyone has to pay their bills. The mistake borrowers made was believing anyone in government was coming to rescue them from their own poor decisions. Here’s the hint, politicians say shot to get elected even when they have zero intent of actually delivering on their promises. These student are young and maybe don’t know this.

"What makes me most sad about this is how effectively the right has moved the overton window on this conversation.   We should be discussing free public university tuition, because having everyone that wants to / has the grades to go to college is a huge net positive on society. I don't necessarily need everyone to get the most profitable possible return on investment degree, because an educated populace is intrinsically valuable. University education is not supposed to be simply workforce preparation, but we've lost sight of that.  Instead, because the situation is fucked and we've allowed people to go into serious debt for college, people can only view it as a return on investment. And because we're nowhere near a legislature that would entertain free tuition, the only move up for discussion has been executive actions on debt forgiveness. And sadly as a long-term strategy debt forgiveness with no legislative change to the causes of those debts is also not a great policy, even if it's probably a net good for the moment.  Then we have this shit dragging the discussion even further right by further crippling those already in debt.  Instead of being able to promote a policy that actually fixes things, we're stuck defending the mediocre stop-gap from people like the one you're replying to, who want to punish people who made an imperfect decision at 18 years old in a catastrophically broken system. They want to maximize consequences so the people already succeeding won't ""feel bad"" while not fixing a damn thing. Everyone's perspective has been warped, and the ""middle"" view has become not ""how should we help them"" but rather ""what is the right amount of ruining their lives?""  And before someone asks or assumes, I got one of those ""worthless"" liberal arts degrees after 2010, paid off the loans in less than 10 years, and still support student debt forgiveness and free public college tuition.

There is no true economic definition of middle class. In other countries it’s referred to as working class and that’s just as ambiguous. You can draw the lines wherever you want to prove a point.   I think the best way to look at is “do you have a reasonable discretionary income after paying for your basic needs”. If you’re poor that’s an easy “no”. If you’re wealthy that’s a no brainer “well beyond reasonable”.   Changes like this reduce that answer from “yes” to “no” for many people who considered themselves middle class.,tonytroz,2025-05-06T13:05:23,2

"If someone paid back 100% of the loans the take out (not including interest) or even 115%, would you still be taking issue with their debt being forgiven?  Teenagers are the ones being targeted with these loans. People are still paying back loans decades later, often paying well more than they ever borrowed. Young adults that don't come from wealthy families are being saddled with this debt that snowballs before they ever graduate. For example, I have paid over $13K to one loan provider, with $6800 going towards interest and $6400 to principal. I borrowed just under $20K total and I owe $19,600+. By the time I pay it off, it will easily be over 50% interest on the loan. That's fuckin insane   I think you may have a point of people are paying 50%, 80% of their original loans and don't ever end up using their degree. I think the system needs to be reworked. Perhaps it's a finance charge so that 110% of the loan needs to be repaid, and when it's paid it's paid. Perhaps the loans need to be capped with a low interest rate so that people aren't paying their loans back at 150%-200+%.

"Predatory means setting up a system that preys on desperation, targeting broke teenagers with lifelong debt and selling it as their only shot at success.

No. It's that debt is meaningless. This doesn't solve the education price problem anyway. It just rewards people for not paying off debt and punishes those who spend money wisely.  I'm glad it's garnished. I know many people not paying because they are gambling on loan forgiveness at some point.  If you take on debt it's your responsibility to pay it.

"1.  I took my first student loans out before I was 18.  2.  Student loan is very, very challenging to discharge, even in bankruptcy.    3.  Higher education should be paid for by the government, because it's education, and education is beneficial to society broadly.  Your point about college not making sense for a lot of people is well-taken, and we really do need to be encouraging and facilitating more young people getting into the trades and similar, especially and in the absence of a functioning apprenticeship system.  4.  Yes, the higher education system is a massive mess, and we very much do need to be reining in costs, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be open to fixing the harm that that systemic failure caused.    5.  We subsidize all sorts of shit that doesn't benefit taxpayers evenly, or even at all.  I don't get to tell the government how to handle disaster relief, manage its transportation system, or regulate polluting companies, all of which are examples of heavy subsidies, market-distortions, and demonstrated negative effects.  I personally cannot imagine this being the hill to die on, especially since those loan forgiveness proposals come with income caps.",st4nkyFatTirebluntz,2025-05-07T02:05:43,2

If conservatives are so fiscally responsible why are they the ones who always tank the economy?

"They're not even arguing what i initially said.  I've seen the incompetence of this administration. I said that there will be people who paid off their loans, by themselves, in full, without any forgiveness, that will suddenly find that someone in the government has decided that they didn't pay off the last $5000 eighteen years ago and will want to go after the $5K plus compounding interest. Good luck trying to get the government to believe the old closing documents too.  This administration has almost made incompetence an art.

"They're not comparable situations, I agree.  In one instance, you've got physical collateral for the loan, and for the other you don't have anything worth value.    The issue is that no one would loan an 18 year old the amount of money that it takes to go to college with no collateral.  That's the way it used to be.  With that system, poor people didn't have any way to go to college unless they did so good in high school or were so good at sports that someone else paid for them to go to college.  Rich people didn't have an issue since mommy and daddy paid for it.  The ""fix"" was to ensure that even though there was no collateral, the US government made a promise that it wouldn't allow someone to not pay it back if the bank loaned the student the money.    What actually happened is that colleges saw that all of these kids could take out as much money as they wanted because the banks had no issue loaning it to them.  The colleges basically saw it as an easy way to boost revenue and pay for all of the nice new buildings, facilities and football programs that they always wanted, so they raised the price of tuition.    Now people are clamoring that they shouldn't ever have to pay back this money that they voluntarily borrowed because everything is too expensive and no one should have loaned them the money in the first place.    Garnishing is a normal means to recoup a debt.  No more, no less.  people signed a contract that said they'd pay back the money they borrowed to get an education.  Now that they got the education, they are saying they shouldn't have to pay.  I was saying, maybe the degree can be the collateral.  Make the loan eligible for discharge through bankruptcy, but if you do you forfeit your degree.  This would not only make the banks look at the likelihood that someone will be able to pay it back in the future, but also make getting a degree that will pay off in the long run more appealing to colleges.",speed3_freak,2025-05-07T23:44:43,1
