Good now let’s talk about actual antisemitism.,Macc304,2025-05-01T19:18:18,2
the fact that a Bill Cassidy is screaming these amendments are poison pills to the bill itself tell you exactly why they were trying to pass it in the first place.,Shady_bookworm51,2025-05-02T10:02:40,1
"I love all religions equally (love for them to all be abolished, but regardless).  The fact that we are disappearing people who speak out against Israel is really crazy to me.   It’s almost like, Israel owns Trump and our American politicians. I can protest almost anything but the second someone is pro-Gaza and anti-Israel… BYE.   This was from a recent pro Palestine protesters disappearance:: “ Court document claims 'potentially serious foreign policy consequences’”  Rumor is Epstein was connected to Israeli intelligence.",ReelNerdyinFl,2025-05-01T20:12:33,-3

Reddit uses an ai for censorship now and its pretty strict compared to before. It doesnt understand context or sarcasm. Just got off a banned for defending against racism.,4moves,2025-05-01T17:06:11,17
Republicans hate everyone that isn't white.  They just don't want to lose the ability to get their bribes from the Israeli government.,cumbersome-shadow,2025-05-01T17:21:58,13

"I literally got a warning for making a joke about how they could replace Hegseth with a drunk, violent monkey and it'd do a better job and they thought I was inciting violence and I had to appeal. Meanwhile when my old account got hacked a year ago, their help was absolutely worthless because the hacker had changed the email (and the warning they gave about the email being changed expired in less than a day) so they wouldn't recognize it as my account because I couldn't change the password, since it'd send it to the hacker. Which I pointed out on the gmail account that was still linked at the time which matched with the email that it had been changed from. Reddit moderation is a joke",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-01T22:27:10,4
"Ya, it’s a weird thing. No one can tell us why and even this conversation is considered antisemitism….",ReelNerdyinFl,2025-05-02T12:04:09,0
