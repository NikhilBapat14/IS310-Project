"I think what has become so frustrating in the era is the privatization of the public good, in particular safety.  The idea of being paywalled for emergency notification of major storms is a dystopian nightmare I never imagined would come to life.  There are certain things that lead to flourishing that are effective and efficient. This ought to be on the top of that list.",Fearless-Bandicoot-8,2025-05-02T20:17:30,6
This is a major service relied on heavily when hurricane and tornado season is approaching. The NE area even recently got hit that caused massive power outages. The article mentions specifically how they are struggling to maintain balloon schedules to collect data. This is the worse place to pull any money from and congress must push back on this.,AerialDarkguy,2025-05-02T20:11:40,4
"There are many things i dislike about this administration, Among the worst is this urge to cheer on the harmful impacts their decisions will have on the very people who put them in power. It is difficult to not become the hate filled things we hate in these times.",ceiffhikare,2025-05-03T06:00:24,3

"He'd gladly sacrifice 100,000,000 human lives to enrich himself, and his ego.  His disgustingly wealthy upbringing taught him that human lives hold no innate value.  He's incapable of seeing human beings as anything other than toys to play with, and break.  We're all just worthless insects who won't say ""Yes!"" to him.",squiddygoat,2025-05-03T13:52:49,1
