"I thought Zelensky did eventually accept Trump's peace deal, but Putin was the one that wouldn't?",Zaphenzo,2025-04-23T14:24:55,634
Have we heard anything about what Putin is willing to accept?,JackNoir1115,2025-04-23T19:10:46,161
"B Expand oil sanctions and dual use sanctions. Trumps tariff brought a positively stunning development, briefly lowering Russia's oil at 53$ per barrel. Oil makes up 30% of Russia's revenue and their budget assumes the price will be 70$ per barrel. If this drop could be repeated and kept through more targeted tariffs and sanctions it would be an impressive step. Kellog states that energy sanctions on a scale of 1 to 10 are at level 3. I find this hard to believe since it begs the question why aren’t they at least an 8? But would be big if true.  Still there is room for expanding both energy sanctions and sanctions on chips and other western components. Every single halfway sophisticated Russian weapon is full of western components and sanction busting costs Russia a lot while the cost of imposing the sanctions is small.   [https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/russian-urals-oil-prices-fell-lowest-level-since-2023-brent-price-collapsed-2025-04-07/C](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/russian-urals-oil-prices-fell-lowest-level-since-2023-brent-price-collapsed-2025-04-07/C)   Reform diplomacy. Wittkoff has to go, he is not competent in this field and his comments are toxic to obtaining any long lasting peace.   He even repeats blatantly false Russian propaganda and that’s only his first mistake. I am sure he is very capable in the estate business, not here.  Walk back the statement that Ukraine won’t get into NATO, it’s a powerful diplomatic concession that shouldn’t be given for absolutely nothing. Also return to the previous mineral agreement deal (2 one) and drop the recent terrible proposal.   In addition put someone with knowledge in the field like Kellog and Rubio to generally oversee the Ukraine war and deliver accurate summaries to Trump, otherwise wrong information will breed wrong choices.  Make a public statement that unless Russia makes concessions to achieve peace the US will not remove any sanction, will keep intelligence sharing with Ukraine, will keep payed starlink services to Ukraine, will not suspend military aid and that it will be a long suffering, costly war for Russia unless Putin stops (Russian recruitment increased after US comments of a ceasefire in the false belief that the war was about to end, reminding them that unless Putin wants peace it won’t come would help decrease that) Finally Include Europe and Ukraine in the negotiations with Russia to increase the leverage.   This won’t end the war alone, but it’s a clear message that Putin can’t hope to outlast the west and that the US won’t bail him out from the confrontation he created.   **After seizing the russian funds the cost of this plan would be minimal and the result likely decent.** ",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-24T05:18:54,16

"Putin didn't.  However, Zelensky wants weapons to keep fighting in exchange for handing us so much of his natural resources to keep fighting since Russia isn't stopping.  Trump now wants to basically hand Russia everything they've conquered and formally recognize Crimea as part of Russia.  There's likely to be lots of economic incentives blessed on Russia as well.  So I suppose from Zelensky's point of view he gets nothing - he hands off his mines to us, hands off a quarter of his country to Russia, gets zero defensive assurances, and Russia gets to invade him again in a couple of years with no repercussions.  Sadly Trump has zero patience for Zelensky and bottomless patience for Putin, so this is the best deal Zelensky's going to get.  Ukraine loses a lot now, Russia gets rewarded a lot now, and Ukraine loses more later on.",cathbadh,2025-04-23T17:07:35,518

"I am also interested by those but i fail to see the connection. If your connection is Trumps dubious decisionmaking on Ukraine is connected to the files it seems a great leap of logic. The problem is not really Trump as much as the fact that he is surrounded by people who at least in foreign policy are a mix of incompetence and disinformation including Russian disinformation.       If you have a head of intelligence agencies who emphatizes with figures like Assad and missunderstands the beginning of the Ukraine war, Hegseth who seems to believe that the US navy is no match for the russian navy (quick reminder Ukraine without a navy decimated a solid part of Russias black sea fleet), you have Wittkofd and Musk who are literally sharing Russian propaganda. I can understand part of it as posturing and i can assume some of this things are personal opinion who are not shared in their work but still it's a pretty terrible environment to handle the Ukraine war. No surprises that Trump sometimes blurts out wrong information.   Though to be fair Hegseth has initiated some pretty great reforms in military procurement.    The Trump administration has done some great things and i am confident they will continue improvements in immigration control as in the Israel-Palestine-Iran conflict. But not calling out grave mistakes in it's handling of Ukraine war and EU-US relations only means allowing those mistakes to bury Conservatives in the midterms and weakening US hegemony.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-24T10:00:24,2
"Well tecnically speaking it's not. Or more accurately. If the question is how much of their territory not conquered by Russia they have to surrender the answer is 0%. Even without direct US aid Russian territorial demands are far superior to anything they can realistically conquer before they are unable to continue.   If the question is how much of the conquered territory they won't be able to reclaim, well that mostly depends on EU and US efforts. The West or more precisely EU and US have always had since the beginning the possibility through serious aid and more risky political manouvers of putting Ukraine into a good military position to reconquer most of it's territory. But with Biden and a hesitant EU we chose a passive approach, to drip feed aid (which in the end cost us as much as acting decisively at the start) and trying to convince Russia the invasion was a bad idea. This approach and political blunders brought as to the current situation where with current aid and developments Ukraine will resist but is unlikely to reconquer any meaningful parts of territory  Technically speaking we still have that option but it would have a decent amount of political risk and it wouldn't be cheap (well unless we use frozen Russian assets).   I wrote recently some very rough amateurish plans on what the US could do to allow Ukraine to regain some of it's territory, safe to say the political will for plan number 2 and 3 in the US and various EU countries is not present at the moment. Doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.

"> Lose a little bit now, get peace, or everything later.  Except you don't get peace. We've done this before, back in 2014-2015 with the previous peace accords. Russia kept violating them and then they later invaded the entire country. Ukraine unilaterally giving away chips on the board is pointless.  > Only way russia is forced out is massive US deployment of boots on the ground and weapons. Which under no circumstance will be allowed to escalate to that point  Or you know, just properly supply Ukraine with equipment (which Biden never did) and also start an air campaign from the American side.

As far as zero defensive assurances, that's not true. There is an unspoken defensive assurance (because it has to be, otherwise Russia won't agree to it) in that Americans will be in Ukraine to mine the resources, and any attack that is aimed at Americans will end up with us engaging with actual war with Russia, which is a war they WON'T win, especially after depleting themselves against Ukraine for this long.",Zaphenzo,2025-04-23T18:30:00,-156
">Zelensky wants to accept the mineral deal but doesn't want to make a deal with Russia.  He wants something in exchance for the minerals, like weapons.  He's repeatedly been willing to make deals with Russia.  But you have to understand that a deal is just that - something where both sides get something.

"Ukraine (no matter if it's Zelensky or another president) does want to negotiate, but Russian demands are either completly irrealistic or unaceptable for Ukraine due leaving the door open to future attempts of invasion.  At this point the US has 3 rough choices.  1 Not providing aid to Ukraine, but keeping up sanctions, intel sharing and allowing purchase of US weapons for Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia will suffer some more but the most likely outcome is a better deal in the next 6 months. The US will though lose a lot of leverage over Europe and general faith in it's foreign policy.  2 providing from some more aid to Ukraine by seizing 5 Billion Russian assets and expanding sanctions. It will most likely shorten the timeframe of the war to achieve a similar deal as point 1 but better for US and Ukraine. US will also keep more leverage and faith in Europe and abroad which also translates in more purchases of US weapons. If instead the US pivots once again as the leader of a western coalition and takes a decisive approach Biden didn't have the guts to set it will likely translate to renewed US hegemony and a successful pivot to Asia after the situation is resolved. NATO and US allies will be rebalanced but generally prosper.  3 Continue trying to pressure Ukraine into a bad agreement, potentially even by threatening to lift sanctions and stop intelligence sharing. Depending on how bad the agreement is and how much pressure the US applies this might or might not work. US alliances will suffer immensely and the US will lose several times the value it would have needed to aid Ukraine seriously. Depending on how bad it goes this also heralds more wars to come especially around Taiwan and worsen global instability.  As of now from what i can see we are between point 2 and 3, apparently driven by an irrational desire to make a temporary truce that even if not mantained will make the problem disappear temporarily. If done correctly point 2 is not that bad, we are not doing it correctly. Problem is that even such a positive deal for Russia will likely get rejected since Russia is counting on US completly abbandoning Ukraine and Europe not stepping up, no pressure on Russia and they will continue to ask more as they have been doing so far.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-24T09:21:20,3

"The Soviet Union was a global power. Russia is a regional power bound to slip downwards whose main goal is to become a superpower again through territorial expansion. Even taking a realist amoral connotation of the events then yes Russia will pursue it's interest through attempted military expansion and US and EU will do so too by trying to eliminate Russia's expansionism and securing their influence.  Russia didn't invade Georgia when it was about to join NATO, or Ukraine in 2014 and 2022, it invaded them when they tried to join western prosperity and therefore become more autonomous from Russia. NATO expansionism is a recent excuse (Putin had no problems with Ukraine and Finland joining NATO prior to 2008) made to justify Russian expansion.  Russia was invaded when it didn't have nukes and aggressive militaristic neighbours, none of thos conditions exist today, who do you think would want to seriously invade Russia? The Baltic states who prepare fortifications on their borders in wait for a Russian invasion? Germany who needed 3 years of war to wakeup to it's defense needs and who at the beginning didn't want to send ""offensive weapons"".  France which can barely handle juggling the France Afrique, European integration and defense and strategic autonomy?  FInally Europe is rearming but you won't find a single even remotely influential person even considering the boneheaded idea of trying to take Moscow. Instead you will find Russian state TV celebrating the idea of invading Europe and Russian government signs saying ""Russias borders end nowhere""  It was our US and EU appeasament of Russia in 2008 Georgia, 2014 Ukraine, 2015 Syria and even 2022, especially under Obama who brought us in this mess, doubling down on that strategy is madness.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-24T14:22:10,1
">You get the chance to fortify, dig-in, and procure (where procurement for the defender is massively more impactful due to the force multiplier of defense, Ukraine can focus on cheap defensive equipment like drones/mines, while Russia requires costly equipment like tanks/troop transports to have any hope of breaking Ukraine's defensive lines)  Christ, this isn't a videogame.  You can't just mine your entire country.  As for digging in, you need to understand that they literally did that nonstop from 2014 until the Russians chose their war of conquest.  They're facing a superior foe and while they've consistently punched above their weight against the Russians, it won't be any different in two years without outside help.

It would just be restarting the war in less favorable conditions.  They gain time to rearm with Chinese weapons.

"There is not one bit of credible evidence that shows that there was western involvement. And there's tons of evidence of how Russia will regularly blame anything that happens that runs counter to Russian interest on US involvement, if you actually watch their own media coverage.

I more struggle to wonder why people like yourself insist that there was US involvement. All you have is ""well we did it in the past"".

"> Christ, this isn't a videogame. You can't just mine your entire country.  I didn't say you could mine the entire country. I said you could acquire quick-to-produce and cheap equipment LIKE mines and drones. They were examples, and hardly the only ones. You're not addressing my point.  > As for digging in, you need to understand that they literally did that nonstop from 2014 until the Russians chose their war of conquest. They're facing a superior foe and while they've consistently punched above their weight against the Russians, it won't be any different in two years without outside help.  Ukraine was caught underequipped and underprepared with a very small standing army. Even if peace occurs, they will already have large stockpiles from this war AND they will not demobilize to pre-war levels. Fortifications aren't as useful when your troop count is 190k and you're using Soviet-era tanks and weaponry.  > Unfortunately far too many seem more than happy to ensure the Russian, Chinese, North Koreans, and Iranians win victories if it might cost us old worn out equipment, all because they lap up Russian disinformation like it is the truth.  Giving them old equipment won't achieve anything you're thinking in your head it will. They cannot retake the occupied territories with old equipment. They're outnumbered 4 or 5 to 1 and Russia's army is modernizing its equipment quickly due to its wartime manufacturing (so ""old equipment"" will generally be a disadvantage for Ukraine, though not always in the case of things like retired service rifles). What you're proposing will damage Russia more, yes, but that comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives and their future economy (remaining in wartime economy sets Ukraine back every single day, and they're already having to mortgage some of their future to pay off the debt they're accruing, it will only get worse).  The absolutely blinding irony of people being pro-Ukraine but essentially ignoring that they're cheering for us sending Ukrainians to die for our foreign policy concerns... it's wild.  > They gain time to rearm with Chinese weapons. They'll violate it because the ultranationalists like Putin truly believe Ukraine belongs to them.  Russia doesn't generally need to rearm. Its stockpiles aren't dry, they're drying up, but they're not gone. They don't need peace to rearm, they can buy from China will continuing the war. We already established, either way, that Ukraine can rearm to greater effect due to its defensive advantage.   > And since the US seems willing to let them do whatever they want without consequence, why wouldn't they violate it?  Russia has more casualties from this war than the USA suffered in WW1 (and possibly WW2, depending on the estimates). They've lost about as many tanks than the US army employs. Their economy is suffering crippling inflation. They're having to sell of their natural resources at steep discounts just to stay afloat. I'd say they've had consequences lol.  You're not giving any feasible proposal with any clear end goal in mind. You're just complaining that you don't like the outcome of Russia winning land. Sorry, wars don't always end with the good guys winning. Russia deserves to lose, but it won't. The most favorable peace deal Ukraine can get is right now. Every day it will get less favorable, and Ukrainians will have died in the process. The only way to avoid this is the USA getting more directly involved, with things secondary tariffs or direct military intervention. I sincerely hope you're not proposing either.",PhilosophicallyNaive,2025-04-24T00:12:53,-3
"I have a friend who grew up in Crimea, and is currently fighting for his home. I’m well aware of their innate desire to not become Russian, and he’s been verbal about that for many years.  I’m simply stating that if the intel community can nudge an outcome in our favor with relatively little risk, they will. Not with little green men, or huge cyber ops, but very simple things like releasing stories pushing one view over another. Organic change doesn’t mean we didn’t help or tweak where we could.  I wasn’t trying to say we fomented revolution, or were the cause of anything. I’m just saying we live in a grey area kind of world, not black and white. The Ukrainians have shown time and time again they can make their own decisions, I wasn’t trying to take away from that.  Exit: I’m really struggling to explain nuance through reddit.

"Oh for christs sake have you seen Russias neighbours? Between Russias western neighbours there is Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Ukraine and Georgia. You know which of this one invaded 3 countries in the last decades, helped two dictators stay in power and massacred a region seeking autonomy two times? NONE, that was always Russia, the same country who has government shields saying ""Russias borders end nowhere"" and Russian state TV cheering on the idea of invading Europe and nuking US and EU (ironically they never say what would happen to Russia)  Russia attacked Chechnya in the first Chechnyan war and when defeated made ""peace"" and attacked them again in the second Chechynan war, don't get me wrong the Checnyan were everything but angels, but still they shelled a city to the ground massacring tens of thousands of civilians.   Russia then invaded Georgia in 2008.    Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014    Russia intervened to keep Assad and his regime in power during the Syrian civil war    Russia sent troops to keep the dictator Lukashenko in power in Belarus    Then Russia invaded Ukraine again in 2022.

And since 1812 ""Russia"" has invaded at least a dozen country and repressed dozens of revolts (let's be clear the idea of going back to 1812 to measure how many invasions did one or the other is quite absurd, as is saying the ""west""  invaded Russia two times and therefore Russia can now try to invade all of it's neighbours)   How a country notorious for all of it's history for it's imperial ambitions has somehow made some people believe they are a threatened sheep is beyond me, next i will be hearing how the british were poor sods who wanted to share their love for spices with the world and never harmed a single soul outside the UK.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-25T08:37:18,2
