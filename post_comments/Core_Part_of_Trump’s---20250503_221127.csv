"As per [original article](https://newrepublic.com/post/194791/shock-poll-core-part-trump-base-abandoning) üì∞:  - Donald Trump, who saw an increase in support from rural voters in the 2024 election, is now seeing huge defections, according to a new PBS/NPR/Marist poll.  The poll taken last week found that only 40 percent of rural voters approve of Trump‚Äôs job performance, down from 59 percent in February, according to Newsweek. Forty-five percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump‚Äôs performance in April, which is up from 37 percent who said they disapproved in February.  In the weeks between polls, Trump has unveiled a slate of policy directives that threaten the livelihoods of rural voters, including his sweeping ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù policy that has undermined essential trade with America‚Äôs top trading partners.  Last month, the European Commission agreed to levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on cigarettes from Florida, beef from Kansas and Nebraska, chicken from Louisiana, car parts from Michigan, and most importantly, soybeans‚Äîof which the European Union bought $2.43 billion‚Äôs worth in 2024. Trump responded with his own insipid optimism, counseling everyone to ‚ÄúBE COOL!‚Äù  Farmers were also hurt by Trump‚Äôs dismantling of USAID, which lost them $2 billion, and the administration‚Äôs upending of programs for farms to provide produce for schools and food banks lost them at least another $1 billion.  Farmers aren‚Äôt the only rural residents hurt by Trump‚Äîworkers and small businesses have also been impacted by shrinking consumer confidence and fears about an impending economic recession caused by roiling markets. Some believe it‚Äôs already begun.  But that‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg. The president‚Äôs massive cuts to disaster preparedness programs threaten vulnerable rural regions that could be hit by the oncoming hurricane season. After Trump floated eliminating FEMA altogether, the agency stopped paying for temporary housing for more than 1,200 families displaced by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.  As recently as Friday, Trump‚Äôs directive to slash federal funding at NPR and PBS would also disproportionately impact rural areas, which receive the most of the sliver of money granted by the government for educational and cultural programming.  The only group of voters, between those in urban, suburban, and rural areas who reported an increase in support for the president, were small-town voters, with 53 percent approving of his job performance, in an increase from 46 percent in February.  In the 2024 presidential election, a whopping 62 percent of rural voters supported Trump, while only 36 percent backed Kamala Harris, according to AP VoteCast. This demonstrated a 4 percent increase in rural support for Trump compared to 2020.",T_Shurt,2025-05-03T22:12:47,19

"Trump is from a period where the thing that made America great over the rest was it being unaffected by the two world wars, allowing it to get an economic head start and have an advantage globally by just continuing to develop where others had to rebuild before developing. ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô countries such as the UK where rationing up till the 70s in some places and had to rebuild whole industries as well as replace multiple lost generations. Meanwhile the USA was building caves full of cheese just because it had the capacity to subsidise to such an extent.  Today‚Äôs America is the greatest it has ever been even under this regime but that‚Äôs not enough. The MAGAT idea of greatness is simply destabilisation and blind patriotism. Who cares about rights when you‚Äôre still the best option in the world?   That‚Äôs why he wants out of nato. That‚Äôs why he wants Ukraine to be the new east/west Germany. That‚Äôs why he  continues to poke some parts of this new axis of evil (Iran/ maybe china depending on how things develop) and encourage the already hostile ones, like Russia, North Korea.   Trump has Cold War blues. He wants 60% of Americans working in factories and mines for pennies to keep the evil reds away from their borders. He wants America destabilising regimes and democracies in favour of more agreeable ones. See the latest comments on Germany from his admin. See musk calling for the toppling of the ‚Äòfacist‚Äô  British government. He wants a world where you are either with America 100%, or an enemy to freedom.   The sad reality is he would have a better time doing this by marshal planning these destabilised nations.

"It's actually because of control of media.  Consider in rural areas your primary source of entertainment news is Sinclair based / fox news based.  It may also be your only source of print, radio, or television news that requires the least effort to digest.
