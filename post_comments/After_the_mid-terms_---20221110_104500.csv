"Since the Georgia election is heading to a runoff, it's unlikely the DoJ does anything before mid-December when that is finished, which means if they do anything it isn't likely to happen until January 2023 at the earliest.   There is no additional indication that the DoJ is going to move to indict Trump other than what we saw in August/September. The only relevant leaks we've seen is the DoJ is considering appointing a special counsel to oversee these investigations if Trump announces his candidacy for 2024.  https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/doj-trump-investigation-expansion-special-counsel/index.html  But that doesn't mean they'd charge him (much like Mueller and the DoJ didn't charge Trump in 2019), but they just want an ""independent"" in charge of the investigation.",ProLifePanda,2022-11-11T07:03:40,1
