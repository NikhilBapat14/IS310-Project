Why tax the people with lots of money when you can tax the poors and eliminate all of the social programs that keep them from being starving and homeless. Surely nothing bad will come from doing this.,RustToRedemption,2025-04-24T11:36:32,8
All those voters thought Trump was going to be looking out for the little guy  And they probably still think that. Which is why we're in this situation,Big_Knobber,2025-04-24T11:40:55,4
"1 in 15 Americans is a millionaire. This tax would be great, sure, but I’m not sure millionaires can be thrown in the same bucket as truly rich people. Billionaires should not exist in any form, so tax em until they are no longer billionaires",deekaydubya,2025-04-24T11:41:35,3
"LOL, the thought that anyone would fall for Republicans wanting to increase taxes on millionaires. The media keeps getting played like a fiddle every time Republicans start losing support because of their capitulation to Trump. They'll just make up some bullshit about how they are 'secretly' opposing Trump and the media morons parrot it like the gospel.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-24T11:45:26,2
"So, increase taxes on poor people since they're effectively slaves and can't afford to leave the country?",angmarsilar,2025-04-24T12:19:11,2
"they should probably not be using idioms like ""shooting down"" (in this economy?)",realancepts4real,2025-04-24T11:35:49,1
"> ""I think it would be very disruptive, because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country,""   Impose a 100% export *tariff* on their millions. It's a beautiful word. Millionaires can leave as long as their millions stay within the borders of the nation that has allowed them to accumulate these millions in the first place.",YoungestDonkey,2025-04-24T11:47:23,1
Millionaire…. But not billionaire lol,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-24T12:01:01,1
"I'm pretty sure the proposal was to increase taxes on the top income brackets, so calling it a 'millionaire' tax is kind of stupid, but also a clever marketing ploy: Republicans got to pretend they were 'tough on rich people'.  In reality, 99% of people in the upper income brackets are still making most of their money from ordinary income (salaries), so they are worker bees like anyone else, just making more money. If they really wanted to fight inequality they'd increase capital gains or tax the billionaire class, which overwhelmingly pays (percentage wise) a much smaller tax load than the middle class.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-24T11:49:01,2
"Yeah there is a big difference between a million a year in ordinary income and a million in wealth.   The tax proposal was aimed at the extreme high earners and probably wouldn’t touch cap gains.    A million in assets, aka a millionaire’, isnt the swag it used to be.",M4hkn0,2025-04-24T11:59:41,3
"Not at all. I'd say for most married couples, you are looking to *at least* a million dollars if you want to retire semi-comfortably.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-24T12:15:17,2
