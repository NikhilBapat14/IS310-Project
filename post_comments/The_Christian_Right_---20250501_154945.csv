We value nonconformity and revolt against the ideas of superstition and arbitrary authority. Modern Satanists are nonviolent and interested in the pursuit of reason, justice, and truth.”  Christian Nationalism:  Christian nationalism is a form of religious nationalism that focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers, in order to achieve prominence or dominance in political, cultural, and social life.[1][2] In countries with a state church, Christian nationalists seek to preserve the status of a Christian state.[3]",WiltedKangaroo,2025-05-01T20:31:18,2

"Stats and trends do not lie. 30% of Americans reject all religions and that number is only going up. Christianity is in free fall both as an identity and in terms of religiosity ""observing the religion through church attendance and such"".  The younger the demographic, the more irreligious, this translates into irreligiosity trending up with time.  No! Birth rates won't change that. In fact, minorities tend to be more religious and have had higher birth rates for the longest time, that didn't come close to changing things. The stake through the heart of religion is the culture. To preserve religion in a group you have to isolate it culturally which is impossible in a free country.  Edit: An easy way to study this is to compare the US to Western Europe, we have a similar culture and similar secular governance. We're following in their foot steps and today the rate of irreligiosity is over two thirds of their population. That's where we're heading.

Some people need the threat of supernatural punishment to do the right thing; others try to do the right thing because it's the right thing.

The fundamentalists favorite book is the prophecy of Revelation, the only book where the Antichrist makes an appearance.  They read the Bible literally and took the creation of Israel after WW2 as a sign the end times are near.  Politically, their support for Israel is so that the Third Temple can be built on the Temple Mount, which the Antichrist will defile to kick the Apocalypse up a notch.  They invented the Rapture to excuse themselves for helping the Apocalypse along, but their eternal fate has been decided by who they chose to follow.  They've been called the ""Apocalyptic Death Cult"" for a reason, and it's not to be mean.

It is a cosmic self-own hearing Dennis Prager brag about specifically recruiting minorities and LGBT commentators just to ""stick it to the libs"". Well, go right ahead, liberalize your own base.  Dennis Prager and the Dailywire are now crying that support for Israel is collapsing in the the Republican base. No sh1t! the social leftists and libertarians you welcomed into your base always had an anti-Zionist bend and you told your base to accept them and listen to them. This new shift in Israel support is totally the doing of the neo-Right, boomers still overwhelmingly support Israel and so do Evangelicals.",LackingStory,2025-05-03T09:20:55,1
You may have missed where the other commenter described themselves as *Orthodox Christian*. Most of the Christians on the US right are Evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. Different churches.,CharacterUse,2025-05-01T17:28:25,2

"This is correct. From the Orthodox Christian perspective, most Protestants and many Catholics (the Catholic angle is a gray area because the sister churches are making attempts to come back into communion with each other—Pope Francis was a great example of humility, charity and human love) have strayed from the true Christian path, are misinterpreting the Bible and are not following Jesus's teachings. They are considered outside of the Church and are misappropriating the Christian name. To put it simply, regardless of what they say, those who support what is happening in the US right now are not Christian.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-01T18:55:56,2

"Since you deleted the last comment  Whose in charge of these churches?  Same guy in the sky if I'm not mistaken. When some of the lunatics branch off and cause shit you like to say we're not like that.  They represent your faith more than you in America. If the loudest most present advocates of your God are this clueless and hateful how do you stand by and let them desecrate your deity?  Instead you'd rather argue with an internet stranger that branch wings of the same faith shouldn't be to blame for its most representative portion for its public image.  Galatians 6: 1-2  ""Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who love by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. Carry each other's burdens, and know this wall you will fulfill the law of christ""  There's tons more passages, many go their whole lives looking for a religious calling while abandoning the guide that takes them there.  Your faith has followers who are lost, God has already affirmed what you should be doing.",JrYo15,2025-05-02T10:10:26,1
"Growing up in the Greek Orthodox Church, it always felt like it was more similar to the experience of reform Jewish friends than what I saw of evangelical Christianity. The actual outward religiosity was very low and a lot of the teachings of the church seemed more philosophical ideas about how to question how to live than written in stone mandates (despite the whole commandments in stone thing). Might have just been where I grew up far away from where orthodox Christianity had any power to try to shape society, and I was never a believer in the first place so it wouldn’t really have mattered, but it just felt quite different.",ItsLaterThanYouKnow,2025-05-02T02:42:10,2
"I deleted the comment because I decided that actually it wasn't worthwhile getting into this discussion with you. Your comment shows why.  I'm not the other commenter (the one who said they were Orthodox Christian). I have not mentioned my own views on religion, churches, or gods. However, it seems you are religious, at least enough to quote Bible verses presumably more or less off the top of your head (which is a very American evnagelical thing do, most people around the world don't do that, even the more religious ones). In which case you should understand the following:  Churches are run by people and each answers to their own leaders. Protestant evangelicals no more answer to or follow the Catholic Pope, or any of the Patriarchs of the Orthodox Churches (which operate as a fellowship of equal but separate churches) than they would follow an Imam or Rabbi, or any more than a Shia Muslim would follow a Sunni Imam. For all practical purposes they're entirely separate entities.  Telling someone who is Orthodox to rein in Protestant evangelicals on the American right just because they believe in the same God is about as ridiculous as telling a Jew or Muslim.",CharacterUse,2025-05-02T10:41:45,1

"You don't have to be, but what's it called when you understand neither?  Knowing they practice different doesn't mean they aren't responsible for their faith. According the that rule book they keep trying to force into every societal structure they should practice what they preach.  That is if God's word means anything. If it doesn't they should quit the facade and tell us that they don't want people doing anything that makes them uncomfortable.  Otherwise it's all hypocritical and ignorant. Why should anyone respect the practioners of a faith that chooses to ignore the bad deeds done while claiming its for their God? When they themselves ignore the word of their God to default blame? Hence, Practicing what they preech",JrYo15,2025-05-02T12:16:15,1
