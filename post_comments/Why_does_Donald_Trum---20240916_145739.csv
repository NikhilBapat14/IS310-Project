"There is some trouble, partly the fault of Trump though by opposing the border bill which was meant to give adequate funding to the issue.  It's not severe, just somewhat problematic.

"Donald Trump has said many times that closing the border is one of the top priorities for his second term.

"I think closed is the wrong approach. That means no one gets in and no one gets out. That would also trap Americans here.

And then we should give a pathway to citizenship for all the undocumented people here, because like it or not we do actually need them here.

"How is this Trump‚Äôs fault. The border was secure when Biden took office. Even before he was sworn in, caravans of Central American citizens were setting out for the United States. Biden ordered that all construction on the border wall be halted and the southern border erased.

Do you not understand why Trump has gained popularity with citizens of Hispanic ancestry ?

The key plank of Trump's platform in his first term was a Muslim ban - a ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, going through the legal pathways for citizenship. He has always been against both legal and illegal forms of immigration - there's no distinction between the two, looking at his policies, rhetoric, and current campaign platform.   [""Remain in Mexico"" is still in place. ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-asylum-restrictions-us-mexico-border/)Biden just stopped calling it that.

I am sorry if that confuses people, since Trump's supposed to be the 'strong border' candidate, but people really should know better than to think things are so black and white when it comes to politicians.   Their policies really are just the same (asylum restrictions, more funding for DHS, etcetera); border crossings are up for other reasons, empirically. Perhaps instability in central America, or the virtual civil war happening in Venezuela. What I think you are confused about is the difference between ""illegal"" and legal immigration pathways. Illegal immigration is a very small subset of all people that enter the country - only those that do not come through a valid port of entry or overstay their visa. Asylum, worker visa status, green card status, are all legal forms of residency in the United States. if someone like Trump says he wants to cut down on any of those things, what they are opposing is LEGAL immigration.

"Throwing money at a problem is not necessarily going to fix it. Especially since I'd say it's a difference of opinion on what the problem is. To the Dems, the problem is that they've had difficulty processing all of the illegals that come through - and their plan and money will certainly help with that. To the Pubs, the problem is that too many illegals come through - and while money can potentially help with that, the bill didn't try to. In fact, quite the opposite, it effectively made things worse, since it would still allow large number of illegals to come through, and now we're also paying more money for it. The Pub point was that Biden already had all the tools and law at his disposal to reduce the number of people coming through, no more money needed.  And as a general rule, I know I don't give money to people until they've already proven that they can and will solve the problem I need them to.

"That‚Äôs why the immigrants and where they are shipping them is so important to them. Also them voting against the SAVE act that demands voters to provide proof of citizenship. Also the fact they‚Äôve been finding illegals registered to vote. 11,000 since 2020 in Arizona alone. They recently found 600+ in NJ. Idk if you‚Äôre familiar with their one party plan, but it makes a lot of sense with what‚Äôs going on in the country right now. Worse is if they succeed, they‚Äôll have the power to begin changing the constitution and making amendments to benefit them. The first three they‚Äôll attack is the 1A, 2A and then try to get rid of the electoral college because in that case less than 30 cities have over half the US population (and I‚Äôll let you guess how those big cities vote). Less than 150 counties in the US would basically control the other 3000 due to a popular vote. California would become an absolute wasteland with communist laws.

"I fall on the conservative side, so we're a good contrast. The Pubs haven't introduced anything that I've heard of, and from my POV it would be a waste of their time to since anything they introduce, Biden is responsible for implementing, and if he doesn't want to reduce the number of people coming in, then there's nothing Congress can do about it. And I do agree that immigration is good, but I'd also say that unfettered/uncontrolled immigration is bad.  Looking at our past is a good example of that around year 1900. Think of all of the immigrants that came in. The vast majority were fantastic people, but there were a small number that brought with them organized crime. It took more than half a century to root most of that out of New York and Chicago (and still isn't gone) and caused so much misery in the meantime.  Learn from the mistakes of those who came before us, and gradually invite people, and carefully vet who we decide to let in. We can do better these days, and still bring in and help a lot of people.",NoTable2313,2024-09-23T20:16:28,2
"Yes, that's definitely part of it. But, rather than the majority of the country being somewhere in the middle as you'd expect, more and more people, for whatever reason(s), seem to be gravitating more and more towards the fringes in both parties. This is probably a partial reason why politicians (both left and right of center) seem to have difficulties solving even seemingly easy issues that a few of us from each side could probably work out in a room in a matter of hours. Instead, certain simple things end up being tied up in Congress for eons or just don't go far as bills when written to begin with.",howeverthoughtfulape,2024-09-24T09:38:39,0
Right üëç they already busted them in some states they were voting twice and the clerks was in on it. They all have been charged with felony charges. I'm worried about the ones who doesn't get caught. Everyone knows they dragging the illegals in for votes. But I think the cartels are paying them to leave the borders open too.¬†,Inner-Let8995,2024-10-11T01:01:31,1

"But congress can do something about it, they can implement laws and policy to help fix the border issue, and if the president vetoes it, then congress can just overrule that. The issue is that I don‚Äôt think there is one person to blame, in some ways, everyone is at fault. This is just how the game is played unfortunately, we want something similar but the ways we achieve what we want are different.   And I agree, we should learn from the mistakes, and while there is not as much crime coming across from the southern border as when you mentioned, coming around 1900 in the east, it is still good to create a safer and more effective way to allow people just looking for a new life into the country.",AlexMascaro23,2024-09-24T19:32:22,2
Oh you should look into the whistleblowers about the border. They ain‚Äôt just paying for the border to be open. They are actively running the border and working with border patrol.,danksc268,2024-10-11T06:43:25,1
"But the left will give excuses like ‚Äú4 voters isn‚Äôt changing the election!‚Äù Like how dull are you to think this is a unique case? Why do they think the Dems are suing states that are finding illegals voting and trying to make them stop them from voting allowing them to vote? It‚Äôs ridiculous man. The left is so blind to the horrors that will come if Kamala gets elected (steals the election).  200 years of voting and the president has always been announced the day of, all of a sudden they are saying it will take DAYS to count the votes? Gtfoh. They need to know how many votes to forge in order to come out on top.",danksc268,2024-10-11T06:48:58,1
Yet Harris is running around saying she will finish the wall and nobody is tougher on the border than her. She has been over the borders since day one after being installed.¬†,Inner-Let8995,2024-10-11T11:09:16,1
