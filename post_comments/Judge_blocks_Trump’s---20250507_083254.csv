This has been the fundamental issue since the beginning of DOGE, from the beginning of his administration.  It's not what he was doing—we all let the insanity of each individual cut distract us. It's that *he never, ever had the Constitutional power to do it*.   None of it.  The firings, the budget cuts, the ending of Departments, the tariffs (!!!), everything.  And it doesn't matter that Congress has acquiesced. These are changes being done without Congress, without the legal right to do it. Congress would have to *vote* for these things to go through.

"Honestly, I would say this is a full showcase of how the wheels of justice *don't* move. People are able to repeatedly do these insanely illegal, awful things. And the best-case we can get is a wagging finger from a judge that hopefully will be respected.  Reminds me a lot of corporate white-collar crime. Where a company can do ridiculously illegal things that earn massive profits...and then the government says no and they pay a minor fine. *Maybe* one of the people in charge leaves with a golden parachute. So every single person involved comes out ahead from their criminality and theft of countless millions, while someone who steals a candy bar could be looking at years of jail. I see the same thing happening here.  Our best-case scenario for justice is that the criminals face no real consequences beyond a ""awww, you really shouldn't do that"" that they may or may not ignore.",Sminahin,2025-05-07T11:16:36,39

Run an even crazier person that has ""trumps blessing""   Just say fuck it and run Trump's brain-damaged ass a 3rd time   Or just declare martial law before the midterms and royally fuck elections for the foreseeable future.

"I wish we could see their play better. These are oddly specific, and so I get the feeling there’s a deeper strategy here. Not necessarily a good strategy per se, but a strategy nonetheless—one they clearly think is worth pursuing. I want to know, why these three institutions that I’ve never heard of before? Why does Trump know about them? Why did Trump choose this approach for his attack, opposed to the countless other approaches he could have taken? What’s his game?  Someone somewhere is feeding Trump logistical information about how these things work, and Trump is choosing choke points based on that information. Why did he think these would be effective choke points?   How is he judging whether his choke hold works or not? I don’t believe the goal is directly to kill the agency. That’s an ends to a means. The goal is to use the killing of the agency to meet some other priority—so what is that other priority and how’s he determining if it worked?",DuckDatum,2025-05-07T16:06:49,6

"Yes! Exactly true, but these issues go back a long way and (most recently during the Obama years and all through Trump 1) we are being shown how little accountability for the government itself was actually written into the constitution and the laws that followed. It reads like it is strong with all the checks and balances etc, but when push comes to shove no one has actually gone through it to shore up accountability and actual consequences. Not to both sides this...but....both sides have decided to run things on norms and precedent rather than codified law because they benefitted from it. We saw that when McConnell wouldn't allow Obama a USSC judge and just made up some precedent ""rule"" and then later broke that ""rule"" when it suited him. We now have someone who is throwing all that out and insisting that if it isn't a law with teeth, they don't have to follow it.",libginger73,2025-05-07T11:45:34,5
