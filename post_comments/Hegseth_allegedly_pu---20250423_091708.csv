"The message from the White House is, ""We don't care about operational security.""  That's leadership malpractice.  Imagine the panic in both the defense department and intelligence communities.  Imagine what military planners are thinking.  ""Should I assume an element of surprise and go bold with a fast and small team, or should I assume the mission is compromised from the start and slowly build up an excess of force?""  Clearly the latter, so missions from now on will be expensive, low-expectation affairs.  The effectiveness of the DOD just dropped significantly.  Thanks to the anti-leadership of Hegseth and others the value of our $800+B/year investment is now a fraction of what it was a few weeks ago.  Ditto for the intelligence communities, though this was baked in during Trump's first term.  When he gets intelligence briefings our (USA) sources and methods take damage.  There was a major increase in the number of assets (spies) caught and/or killed in his first term.  So they already have the metaphorical hatches battened down for his second.  It's incredible.  It's hard to imagine how a determined Russian asset would do more damage in such a short period of time.  Witting or not, Trump is the star on Putin's dream team.",guttanzer,2025-04-23T09:57:56,3
"You have all of these ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" leakers and journalists and they're saying how dangerous some of these journalists are and they're even saying that there are some of these journalist are very deeply working with pro-Hamas sources, but they're saying that these strikes that Palisades Pete hadn't even started to conduct were just for these perfectly normal to share with journalists and completely regular media co-ordination (who they said shouldn't have even been in the group because they were butt-dialed) in areas where they're seeing these Houthis attack these ships, but we have 'Fox & Friends' and Pandering Pete who is still very cozy with too very close of a relationship that voters seem to think is distracting his judgment (and congress had some of the biggest worries they've ever seen about his a history of bad character and very bad judgment).",postsshortcomments,2025-04-23T09:30:41,1
ffs ofc he did. These things would \*never\* be talked about in the open. All written coms about things like this happen using secure channels or are talked about in secure spaces. It's not like this was a casual convo happening in a wendy's parking lot that he texted his friends and family about lol,ibeerianhamhock,2025-04-23T09:30:55,1
