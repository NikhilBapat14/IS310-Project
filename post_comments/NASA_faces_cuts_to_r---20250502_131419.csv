While SpaceX and Tesla get nice cushy government contracts.  Weird.,o8Stu,2025-05-02T13:27:50,14
"This ends NASA.  It will just be a shell of an Agency funneling money to Musk. A few small projects working with FAA (also now Musk), and Defense work will exist.  They can’t cancel NASA entirely without major pushback, but this budget is the same thing, just keeping a NASA stamp for Musk. ",femme_mystique,2025-05-02T14:00:58,6
Ya Elon needs those billions. /s,Imacatdoincatstuff,2025-05-02T13:24:46,5
"Republicans don't give 2 flying f\*\*\*s about science. Besides, this opens up more opportunities to give Space X contracts.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T13:20:13,3

And the lunar lander is Bezos contract. Two ways this goes.   1. He gets the funding he asked for in return for supporting Dear Leader.  2. Trump cuts him because he does not give a fuck about his donors now he's in office.  Same goes for Musk.  Many people are saying... number 2.,williamgman,2025-05-02T14:24:27,1
SLS should have been canned a long time ago.  Pork barrel projects for Senators,box-cable,2025-05-02T13:22:32,3
"Yes, SpaceX will be the only contractor with service to the new Martian gulags",box-cable,2025-05-02T13:24:04,2
"Bezos too, even though they don't have the same capacity, but still that is incredibly dangerous. It's a Republican fantasy though. Cut the federal government out entirely and let a small group of billionaires control everything.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T13:32:29,2

""" Pork barrel projects for Senators""  That is the only reason why. There is nothing wrong with the idea of the project and in fact, as a matter of national security we NEED to have access to space. If a strategic satellite needed to be replaced right now, we'd have to ask permission from Musk or Bezos... Just think about that... The US doesn't have it's own launch vehicle in the meantime.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T13:30:24,4
"ULA exists... Barely. I disagree. I think we are seeing two approaches to heavy lift design, and it's very clear SLS is the better approach compared to starship.",D1ngu5,2025-05-02T14:17:24,2
""" I disagree. I think we are seeing two approaches to heavy lift design, and it's very clear SLS is the better approach compared to starship.""  The issue is not the approach to heavy lift. It's the fact that a private business controls access to it. One with the most obvious political priorities of any in the entire country.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T15:04:42,2
