"When the U.S. liberated Kuwait in the early 90s, there was never a formal cessation of hostilities despite the popular belief that the 'war was over'. Rather, the U.S. continued to provide security guarantees in the area and the Iraqis kept shooting (albeit rather ineffectually) at U.S. troops.  So the invasion of Iraq was merely a resumption of active hostilities. Moreover, it was a resumption of active hostilities favored by the Clinton Administration because it was deemed necessary to resolve the conflict. However, the Clinton Administration had no way to sell a full-scale invasion to the American public so it was never seriously discussed as an option - the same way the Clinton Administration was willing to launch perfunctory airstrikes at Al Qaeda facilities in places like Afghanistan and Sudan but not to commit ground troops.  Then 9/11 occurs. This provided the Bush Administration with a rationale for resolving the Iraq conflict that the Clinton Administration lacked. Moreover, by this point Saddam Hussein had ordered the resumption of the Iraqi development of nuclear weapons. Curiously enough, these orders would never be acted upon because his subordinates found it impossible to pursue nuclear weapons under the sanctions regime and simply lied to him about their progress.  Western intelligence agencies would learn about these lies but not the fact that they *were* lies. As a result, the consensus of Western intelligence was that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons.  Given the ability to muster popular support behind an invasion, the perceived need to stop the development of nuclear weapons and the interminable ongoing conflict, a decision was reached to invade Iraq. Note that this decision would have likely occurred regardless of who was in the White House.  In terms of Bush's attitude towards Hussein, it's impossible to know. However, it's likely that Bush didn't view Hussein as any more innately evil than most other authoritarian rulers of his ilk - indeed, he probably viewed him as substantially less 'evil' than the regimes in places like Iran and North Korea because Hussein didn't base his entire power structure on a mythology of opposition to the West. In terms of political gains, there really weren't any in the partisan sense. The invasion could potentially lead to a more stable international order, but it wasn't going to provide any meaningful benefit to Bush himself.",ViskerRatio,2023-01-23T20:17:14,14

"There is *no one* who becomes president who does something simply out of some noble assessment of good and evil. Even in cases where morality was a clear undercurrent, such as America's involvement of WW2, the decision was still made after careful calculation of political opportunities. Iraq is no different.  Based on the evidence we have of Bush's decision making process, there was certainly a degree to which the key decision makers were drinking the ""bring freedom abroad"" kool-aid. Of course, a more democratic and free Iraq would reap political benefits for the US and it's hard even in cases of absolute evil to suggest *acting upon that with an aggressive military invasion* is some sort of moral action.",mormagils,2023-01-24T09:02:33,3

This isn't really an argument we can make since none of us had then - nor have now - the intelligence possessed by the various nations. What we know is that Hussein himself believed he was pursuing nuclear weapons and that Western intelligence communities believed he was as well. The fact that UN officials on a guided tour of facilities were unable to find materials/processes that the Iraqis would have gone to great lengths to disguise would have been unlikely to persuade intelligence officials of much.,ViskerRatio,2023-01-25T10:31:23,0
"> There was no real proof that Iraq was working on WMDs, and no one in the intelligence community really believed it.   I suppose you can quibble about what constitutes ""real proof"", but it's inarguably that Western intelligence agencies *did* believe that Iraq was continuing to seek WMD.  Something to remember is that the Bush Administration didn't need WMD at all to justify the invasion of Iraq. Iraq was in clear violation of the ceasefire terms and there was considerably political support across the Arab world for the removal of Saddam Hussein. The *only* reason the Bush Administration was talking about WMD was because the intelligence they received was saying that WMD development existed.  The notion that the Bush Administration 'lied' about WMD simply isn't supported by the facts.",ViskerRatio,2023-04-10T16:20:24,1
"Irrelevant.  First off, Hayden's only one opinion. If Panetta disagreed with him (which your own source states, I'm assuming you didn't read it in full and only grabbed a quote to support your defense of Bush), then that means there is no consensus on where fault lies with the intelligence community. Someone who actually read the NIE in full would probably realize the intelligence community made it quite clear they didn't have evidence of a nuclear weapons program. Furthermore, Hayden was only NSA Director at the time of the NIE - an agency that barely contributed anything at all to the estimate. So Hayden's hardly authoritative on this, and we should consider other sources, including those that lay the blame on Bush and the Office of Special Plans. Like adults would.  Bush made the ultimate decision for a full-scale invasion, occupation, and regime-change. Which was disastrous. Even if he was acting solely on the NIE (which he was not, per his own words and that of Cheney, Rumsfeld, Scooter Libby, Wolfowitz, et al) that doesn't explain why he chose the unimaginably destructive and wasteful course of action that he did. So this doesn't actually answer the question and comes across as more of a mealy-mouthed excuse for the Bush administration.

Bush and Congress were specificity told by the total accumulation of our intelligence agencies in high confidence that Iraq possessed WMDs.  It wasn’t known at the time that a confirmation bias had set in into the IC that cumulatively ignored exculpatory evidence for the decade prior.  High confidence is as definitive as it gets for an intelligence estimate, and it would have been negligent to ignore without the benefit of hindsight.

"I would like to remind you that I didn’t claim that it was the Bush administration that lied but that someone did.  Former Bush administration press secretary Ari Fleischer said: “I can state with certainty no one expressed doubts to me. I was told Saddam had chemical and biological stockpiles. I was told he did not have nuclear, but he was working on it. There were no doubts, hesitations or nuances raised. If there had been, it would have been reflected in what I said.”   Also there is nothing to quibble about there was no evidence at all other than the words of a raging lunatic. If that is considered proof then Trump might as well be a prophet.    And finally, yes Bush’s invasion was “justified” but the extent to which it went on was not. The issue is not that the US invaded Iraq but that it did so under false impressions and through a lack of understanding of the situation they were attempting to “fix”.",Phantom78611,2023-04-10T16:49:44,1

Someone who read it wouldn’t conflate nuclear weapons as the only type of WMDs as well.  Read the Constitution as well because the President cannot authorize war powers on their own. Only Congress can and they withheld their decision until for the 2002 NIE to be produced on their request.

"> I would like to remind you that I didn’t claim that it was the Bush administration that lied but that someone did.  As I noted in the original post, the 'liars' were really those in the Iraqi government afraid to tell Saddam Hussein that his ideas about pursuing nuclear weapons weren't realistic. By the time that information filters down to Western intelligence agencies, it looks a lot like truth to them.  It's akin to the people who imagine a conspiracy where FDR 'tricked' the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor. Yes, there was information beforehand that - if properly appreciated - could have led the FDR administration to realize an attack was imminent. But the notion that FDR simply let all those soldiers and sailors die as some sort of political game is unfounded. Intelligence is never certain and the FDR administration made a mistake.  Indeed, if you look at the history of modern warfare, these mistakes are the *norm*. It's very easy to look at the situation in retrospect and see where these mistakes were made. But it's significantly more difficult to sort through the maze of often conflicting information in the moment.  > Also there is nothing to quibble about there was no evidence at all other than the words of a raging lunatic.  There was information from with Iraq's government indicating they were attempting to reconstitute the program. There were various attempts (or perceived attempts) to procure materials for nuclear weapons. And that's just what we know from publicly available information - we don't know all the of the classified information that has yet to be released. While there were various agencies that didn't view an invasion of Iraq as warranted or desirable, our allied foreign intelligence agencies were fairly unified in their opinion that WMD *were* being pursued.",ViskerRatio,2023-04-10T17:15:05,0
">Hayden stated a fact as he and all other intelligence agencies directors agreed to key findings of NIE.  No, that's not what your source says.

Just two isolated voices.

That seems like a good compromise position for a mature person to take...  >Read the Constitution as well because the President cannot authorize war powers on their own.  Rude. Not sure what point you're trying to make here anyway - the President submitted the AUMF to Congress. It was his measure to push and it wasn't required anyway - it wasnt a declaration of war.

They wouldn’t act at the behest of the White House, but withheld their decision until all intelligence agencies provided their intel on the situation.  All 17 agencies agreed in high confidence that Iraq had WMDs which was no longer acceptable in a post 9/11 world.  It is easy to doubt their assessment with the benefits of hindsight after such a massive failure, but at the time they had no reason to doubt their estimate.    Furthermore, WMDs are much more than nuclear weapons.  The main threat was biological and chemical weapons that Iraq has used before.

Shame on you for pretending otherwise - Bush was a fully grown adult.  >Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons and missiles.  You're playing fast and loose with the truth here. WMDs can describe biological and chemical weapons, but not all biological and chemical weapons would qualify as WMDs. Nice try.  The NIE stated Iraq had chemical and biological weapons - Bush made the decision to invade, topple a regime, and sink America into an unwinnable insurgency for a decade...based on that? Not very good decision-making, and not very convincing argument. Didn't Bush promise something about a mushroom cloud? I mean if there weren't nuclear weapons, what exactly was the point? Might want to mull that over a bit.  Going to suggest you reread the NIE more closely so you can see that while the IC stated with 'high confidence' Iraq had some chemical and biological weapons, it expressly stated **they had no evidence of continuing development programs.** The NIE referred to the simple SCUDs and whatnot Iraq had as far back as the 70s. Nothing threatening to the USA.  The facts are pretty straightforward: the NIE isn't to blame. The person who started the invasion is. That would be Bush and his White House team.
