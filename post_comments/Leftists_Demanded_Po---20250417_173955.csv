"For as much as they yap about ""lived experiences"", they don't seem to have any interest in observing criminals out of an academic setting.   People who have actually lived in shit neighborhoods could easily tell you that some people just act like Skyrim bandits IRL, but leftists think that police descriptions of criminal behavior is so absurd that they must have been lying. They'll just randomly attack people because they're bored, and then cool off a few hours or even minutes later like it didn't happen.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T17:51:52,196

"The left's strategy is to use cases where they can make *plausible* accusations, and then immediately tout it as fact.    Think of Jussie Smollet, who reported that he was attacked by two white men.  The legacy media trumpeted as fact until two immigrant buddies admitted that they had staged the whole thing with him.  Smollet swore it was true, and still does, to this day, but everyone else had to admit it was fraud.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-18T09:20:07,25
