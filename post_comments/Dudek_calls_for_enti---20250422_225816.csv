New hires should be aware the job is only for a few years at most.  Then they'll be removed when someone who is eligible to serve as president is finally elected.  i.e. don't quit a job you like for this shit.,ltcraft05,2025-04-22T23:03:08,12
">Acting Social Security Commissioner Leland Dudek this month instructed staff to prepare to convert wide swathes of his agency to the revamped Schedule F, a move that experts say would stretch even the Trump administration’s wide definition of “policy-related” jobs “beyond all recognition.”   ...   Employee groups and Social Security experts were taken aback by Dudek’s maximalist approach to implementing the new job category. Reclassifying the Office of Hearing Operations entirely into Schedule Policy/Career would impact upwards of 20% of the workforce represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, including jobs that start at as little as $40,000 per year.  >“If this email constitutes SSA’s full decision, then the agency has contorted the term ‘policy-influencing’ beyond all recognition,” said Rich Couture, a spokesman for AFGE’s Social Security Administration general committee. “AFGE bargaining unit employees at SSA dutifully apply policies and procedures, established by agency leadership, in the performance of their duties for the American people every day. The employees are not policy-makers . . . The agency cannot take a chainsaw to necessary civil service protections to thousands of SSA workers in an attempt to solve a problem that doesn’t exist.”  >Kathleen Romig, director of social security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Dudek’s plan seems to bely a misunderstanding of employees’ whose job is to follow policy, not set it.  >“We’re talking about all of external affairs, all of disability adjudication and half of mission support—that’s so many people,” Romig said. “The idea that all of the people who work in each one of those components and subcomponents are somehow policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating is just absurd on its face. Looking at some roles specifically, in communications, it’s people writing pamphlets—they’re not policy-influencing. At the Office of HR—now ‘personnel’—that’s not policy-influencing, they’re just signing employees up for benefits, hiring and running security clearances. You can just point in any direction and say, ‘That doesn’t pass the smell test.’”  All this leads to:  [Social Security Benefits To Be Interrupted Soon: Ex-Administrator](https://www.newsweek.com/social-security-benefits-interuppted-soon-ex-administrator-2062773)  >Former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley is warning that benefit payments could soon be delayed for millions of Americans, citing deep staffing cuts and internal chaos at the Social Security Administration (SSA) under the Trump administration.  >Speaking at a public forum in Long Island on Monday, O'Malley said he believes an interruption in payments could be imminent.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T23:01:18,8
