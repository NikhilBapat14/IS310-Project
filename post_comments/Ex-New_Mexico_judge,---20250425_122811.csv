"""He is currently facing federal charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5). If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.""  That's a lot of prison time for the crime of coming to the U.S. without proper documents and buying a gun (which was not used in any unlawful way).  Most rapists don't get 15 years.  Sounds like the man did some work for the (former) judge and his wife and then they let him rent their guest house.  For this, in Magastan, you now get arrested, no matter who you are.",FIlm2024,2025-04-25T12:40:00,13
There is a lot of slippery slope here.  How do you know you are “harboring” an “enemy”.  Can I get arrested for hiring an arborist with a license that has a man on his crew that has the wrong tat?,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T12:47:55,7
