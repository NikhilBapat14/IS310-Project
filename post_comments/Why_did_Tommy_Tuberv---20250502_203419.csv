"Because he's a criminal. When Republicans say people are committing voter fraud, they're talking about themselves.",BukkitCrab,2025-05-02T20:55:56,481
So voter fraud is only okay when the right does it?,SeniorFlyingMango,2025-05-02T20:56:09,137
I'd love to know if he filed an Alabama State Tax return.  Suspect he didn't because Florida doesn't have a state tax and that's where he really resides.,dremonearm,2025-05-02T21:02:40,74

"Since it’s Tuberville, my first guess is he doesn’t know what state he’s in.",mezha4mezha,2025-05-02T23:11:21,30
He is truly such a piece of shit and an embarrassment. Do people really like this rhetoric? What the fuck?,Shaftmaster420,2025-05-02T22:31:22,23
"can’t fucking believe my home state had a respectable senator in doug jones for all of *one* goddamn term and threw him away at the first opportunity.   could have been worse, though. we nearly had roy moore.",LITTLE-GUNTER,2025-05-03T00:18:59,17

"Alabama is so bad, they elected an average football coach that lives in another state to be there Senator.  Most states would be ashamed by this.  Alabama does not care.",SexyCouple4Bliss,2025-05-03T01:13:26,9
Wisconsin Ron keeps his Johnson in Florida too. They get 4 senators.,pokey68,2025-05-02T22:36:56,7

Can someone do the research on Ron Johnson (WI) too?,Top_Mastodon_5776,2025-05-03T07:05:09,2
I believe I read somewhere that he also claimed a homestead exemption in Florida.  This is of course illegal to claim homestead exemptions in multiple states.  Florida state officials wouldn’t look into the matter.,NAU80,2025-05-03T07:52:23,2
It’s Alabama. Does anyone really expect the state or the voters to do anything to remedy this obvious corruption?,eurotrash1964,2025-05-03T08:12:01,2

Because he is the third senator from Florida.,razzmataz,2025-05-03T00:51:28,1
"Because Florida is more a swing State than Alabama.  I'm sure Tommy just wanted his vote to count for something.  The illegality of it probably never entered his mind - after all, it's okay if your a Republican.  /s  Actually, I kinda sympathize with Tommy - I wish my votes counted as much as other people's votes too - but sadly I don't live in a swing State so Presidential candidates don't even bother to campaign in my State.  Everyone's votes should count the same.  We need to get rid of the electoral college.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-03T04:37:42,1

Because in Florida rules don’t really apply.,bonzoboy2000,2025-05-04T12:37:23,1
"Because you can if you’re a resident of multiple states? As long as he didn’t also vote in Alabama, it’s perfectly legal. Come on guys, this is just a distraction and isn’t doing justice for all the shit this guy spews and does to our country. It’s like talking about Trump and going golfing. I wish he just golfed his whole fucking presidency, that isn’t the problem.",aboynamedculver,2025-05-03T08:50:44,1
"Now now, they commit election fraud and accuse others of voter fraud.
