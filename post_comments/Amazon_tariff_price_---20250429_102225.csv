"My biggest concern here is this feels like government overreach into a private company, dictating how transparent they can be with their customers. I wish more companies did this during brandon’s train wreck of a presidency because I think it would emphasize issues conservatives were running on during those 4 years. To me this feels like the admin is essentially saying they only want us to see info that is favorable to them and anything that is contrary to that is somehow politically motivated. We can’t just start saying any criticism is a personal/political attack. That’s what the Woke crowd is always doing, unable to learn from mistakes because they are so wrapped up in covering them up.  If honest info about tariffs pisses consumers off it’s something we should want so the administration can pivot and make a decision or at least explain the thought process behind the original plan",Nyxaus_Motts,2025-04-29T12:06:54,842

"You are incorrect. It is dishonest to post the price and the tariff cost because the seller sets the price. You don't have to like tariffs but this is a ploy by Amazon to try and stick it to Trump. Here is how.  You want to sell your scissors in MikeyPh-land. There are other brands of scissors sold here and you have set a price of $10 dollars for your scissors to be competitive. Let's say it costs you $5 per pair to produce them, ship them, advertise for them, etc. So that $10 price point allows you to achieve a reasonable profit (100%) while remaining competitive with other scissor makers.  I decide to tariff your scissors. This artificially inflates the cost for you to sell your product. Let's say I put a 25% tariff on top of the selling price of your scissors. So if you sell the scissors for $10, then I get $2.50.  This is where what Amazon is attempting to do is a lie because that $2.50 can be spread in many different ways and balanced with your profit in different ways.  If you don't want the tariff to affect your profit on each unit ($5) then you could raise the price to $12.50. In reality, that is what happens, it just became $2.50 more expensive to sell your product. Everyone says this will just be pushed on to the consumer, but it is not that simple.  The price of your scissors is dictated largely by the market: what are consumers willing to pay for the.? If they are not willing to pay $12.50 for your scissors because your competitors are cheaper, then you'll lose sales because people will choose your competitors.  So what do you do? In order to compete and keep sales growing and not slowing, then you'll eat the cost and try to make it up elsewhere.   You'll try to produce them more cheaply, ship them more cheaply, make your plants more efficient, reduce some of your material costs, etc. OR maybe you'll try to innovate so you can make an even better pair of scissors for the same cost you're making your current scissors, and then it'll be worth it to consumers to pay the extra money.  In other words, if you pass on the cost to the consumer, then the market will respond.  How will the market respond? Either consumers go with a competitor of yours, you innovate to try and retain your consumers, or someone in the market creates new competition that can make scissors more efficiently than you can.  So that makes what Amazon is doing dishonest. THEY set their prices, factoring in all the expenses, including tariffs, and then the consumer decides if that price is reasonable.  By doing what they are doing, they are trying to appeal to people who don't understand tariffs, and by doing so it is allowing competitors to effectively lie to you.  It also doesn't achieve anything except market confusion.   We had tariffs on foreign cars for a long time, they still had to compete with our cars, they didn't just raise their prices and force us to pay a tariff. Why? Because I can just go buy a car that is good enough for me at a cost that is within my price range, whether the tariff is on it or not.  By the way, companies have to factor in all kinds of taxes into their selling prices. Why? Because consumers respond to costs, wherever they come from. Often times it does just mean more expensive goods, but even if you are the only company in town that sells a certain product, there is a price point at which people just do without your product. So there are market factors that limit prices even when there isn't any competition in the market.",MikeyPh,2025-04-29T12:00:53,-84

">My biggest concern here is this feels like government overreach into a private company, dictating how transparent they can be with their customers  I would agree with you, but it is dishonest business practice. Identifying a ""tariff price"" is a lie. If they do that then they should identify every cost that goes into their product and how much profit they make on each one because the truth is the price is determined after all the cost is figured out AND after they settle on a price that they think consumers will pay.  In other words whether there is a tariff on it or not, the market still dictates the value of the product. Some of those forces will act to push the price up, like tariffs, but other forces will act to keep it down, like competition.   If you could actually say ""This is how much the price went up because of the tariff"" then I would agree with you. But since tariffs have exists, companies often eat the cost of a tariff rather than putting it on the consumer. This all depends on the item and what other competition there is.  If France was the only country that made wine and they sold it on average for $10 a bottle, then we slapped a tariff on it, well there isn't any competition, so they might just raise their prices because there is no competition.   But now let's make it a little more realistic. Let's pretend that the US, France, and many other countries make wine AND that the average bottle is still only $10. Now what happens if we just tariff French wine? We still have all these other producers of wine competing, the market standard would still be $10 for an average bottle of wine. In order for France to compete they couldn't just raise their prices, they are still producing average bottles of wine, so what can they do? They can innovate and try to reduce the cost to make their wine to stay competitive, or they can eat the cost of the tariffs and just make less profit, or they would do a little bit of both. They might start by eating the costs but at the same time start planning to scale operations to be able to produce more cheaply.  The point is that a company decides the price they are willing to part with their product. They factor the tariff in. But just because there is a 25% tariff on a product, that doesn't mean the price necessarily has to come up. Other market forces need to be considered. And so what Amazon is doing is bullshit.  The cost of an item has MANY factors that go into it, a tariff is just one.  Companies don't need to disclose when they have quietly reduced the amount of deodorant in a stick of deodorant, but that happens all the time. Amazon isn't disclosing how much of each product goes to Bezos.  What if an item cost $40 to make, to advertise, to ship, to package, etc., and they sell it for $140?  If they told us how much profit they make on each item, which is actually measurable, then I'd say that they can also advertise the tariff... but that isn't even measurable until they have set the price.",MikeyPh,2025-04-29T16:35:47,-47

If you want to do a price breakdown then do a real one. At least from an Amazon perspective I’d want then Country of Origin,  Amazon fees, Sales Tax etc. all broken down into the final price shown on the site. No more hiding sales tax until checkout, give it based on current shipping address.  With that kind of thing I’d lap it up. That’s full transparency. Final price minus shipping, all the various taxes and tariffs and their origin and then Amazon’s cut. Making _all_ the taxes displayed is important. If somewhere has a 20% sin tax I want to see that.

"The tariffs in place previously were either targeted to specific industries for national security, or did not go into effect until a threshold of imported product from a specific industry was reached. The 200%+ tariff on milk that Canada had was an example of the latter, and the CHIPS act put tariffs on semiconductors which is an example of the former.   People didn't care about tariffs before because they mostly did not feel the impact on prices. Now that we're staring down the barrel of at least a 10% markup on a huge number of goods after we just got over horrendous inflation numbers for the past 4 years, people are rightly identifying that the way Trump is implementing tariffs (i.e. a universal tariff across all industries) is a fucking dogshit policy decision.",ifuckinglovebluemeth,2025-04-29T13:10:58,180

"Except in your example, the American made scissors would already be $12.50, or even $15, so raising the price of the cheap imported good doesn't mean they suddenly have to innovate to reduce the price again. We have 200 years of data showing that the price of domestic goods goes up when foreign goods are tariffed, which should be obvious. Why would you sell your product for drastically less than your competition if you don't have to to? And it always limits innovation, because now the domestic companies don't have the same pressure to innovate to reduce costs that they had before. US cars were/are worse because their competition was artificially more expensive. The Jones Act is the prime example of this - we cannot build high quality, reasonably priced ships in the US because the Jones Act has eliminated competition for ships in the domestic market.  It is of course true that 100% of a tariff is not always passed on directly to the consumer, but when margins on cheap goods are lower than the tariff rate, there is no choice but to pass on the costs. Then the domestic manufacturers respond by raising their prices. Maybe that's good in the short term for the domestic manufacturer, who sees an uptick in sales, but in the long run they atrophy from lack of competition and have to be propped up by even more government intervention.",Moto302,2025-04-29T12:28:03,85
"Tariffs are technically paid by exporter, which they may or may not pass to consumers. It’s different from the retail sales tax. So in your example, 25% tariff will be not applied to the retail price, it will be applied to based only on the value of goods purchased by exporter, which in your example will be less than $5, since $5 includes shipping and (presumably) insurance which are not tariffed.

"That’s true for the vast majority of products sold domestically which have additional costs added in after they arrive in the US, but direct shipments from foreign trade zone (FTZ) warehouses are an interesting exception.  Take DigiKey for example. Unless you’re in the electronics industry you might not have heard of them, but they operate the largest FTZ in the United States by number of shipments. Products can be shipped into an FTZ without incurring import duties until they are subsequently shipped domestically and enter the US market. In their case, they have such detailed visibility into their supply chain that they can disclose the actual tariff charges they physically incur for each line item in an order and they’ve done that for years. Charges can vary even for individual parts depending on when they were imported, so you could order 100 parts and get 17 in one bag and 83 in another, individually labeled with date codes and lot numbers.

The left does that, don't pull that with a fellow conservative.  >We have 200 years of data showing that the price of domestic goods goes up when foreign goods are tariffed, which should be obvious.  Where? This is still a gross oversimplification because it depends on what is tariffed, how it is tariffed, and what competition there is. I am not at all arguing tariffs are a net good OR bad, what I'm saying is you don't know what you are talking about and make gross over simplifications. Unfortunately so is everyone else. Even Shapiro has been. SOME tariffs certainly don't help, especially long term but even THAT is dependent on that stability of the market. If you set tariffs relatively permanently and relatively low so there is still some competition, then the market would settle around that and competition would continue around that minor hurdle. Prices needn't be endlessly high.  It's like the ecosystem, if I consistently pull out a small amount of soil and vegetation from a forest, it will disrupt the system a little bit, but it will find an equilibrium around that and still thrive so long as I don't make it too disruptive. Economics is very much like the ecosystem.  >Why would you sell your product for drastically less than your competition if you don't have to to?   Because of market forces you are ignoring.   The whole point of what I was saying is that this is far more complex than you are making it. You share a couple anecdotes, but show that you are just as illiterate as the vast majority of people talking about this. And what is worse is that you are so adamant that this ""Isn't conservative!"" and basically shaming everyone who is open to the idea. THAT is shameful, you don't know what you are talking about but acting like you are and acting like the sky is falling.  Yeah, protective tariffs can have a negative impact on things. The car industry did indeed suffer because we elevated it too much in responses to foreign competition. That is a bad thing, certainly and probably pushed by the unions at a time when they were much more powerful. But if we only tariffed cars from China rather than pretty much all foreign cars, then the story would be far different because there would still be many competitive forces acting on our own markets, driving innovation and competitive pricing.  Further, if THOSE countries didn't tariff OUR cars as much, OUR car manufacturers would have tried to compete more in foreign nations. Those competitive forces would be in action more in our markets. That is another whole aspect of this you completely ignored and that Trump is attempting to address.",MikeyPh,2025-04-29T16:08:00,-10

I'm not even a huge fan of tariffs but Trump may be right. If our government is funded by only sales tax and tariffs, then our politicians all have a vested interest in our economy doing well, and any moves that disturb the economy also makes it harder to balance the budget, so the programs they push better have a legitimate real world economic benefit rather than the lies about just how well welfare works as opposed to smaller community intervention, churches, charities, and such.",MikeyPh,2025-04-29T16:14:21,-9

">Tariffs to prices are easier to explain than fiscal spending to prices.  We buy Chinese goods because they are cheaper.  With tariffs they are more expensive.

">""Ohh American made stuff is ALWAYS more expensive."" That is a bullshit attempt to discredit a point you don't like.  Of course not everything made in the US is more expensive, and I didn't say that. But this whole tariff conversation has revolved around the idea of foreign countries screwing the US by selling cheap crap in our market. If something is cheaper from a domestic producer, then why are we talking about the effects of tariffs? The US producer is already winning.  >Where?  This is literal textbook stuff, but Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson covers this ground in a very accessible way.   But if we're conducting thought experiments, ok, say you're a US scissor manufacturer that is competing with foreign producers, both selling your scissors for $10. Now the foreign scissors get slapped with a 25% tariff, some of which  the producer eats, but say 15% of which is passed into the consumer, so now the foreign scissors are $11.50. Demand goes up for the US scissors instantly, while production can't be ramped up so fast. The classic result is that prices will rise until a new market clearing price is reached. Does the US scissor manufacturer invest in new production? If they have any indication that there will be long-term stability in the tariff, maybe. But when regulations are uncertain, the answer is often ""no."" See ammunition production for how companies consider investment when regulations are wielded by fickle politicians. Plus, they are now selling $10 scissors for north of $11, and they don't have to worry about foreign competition, so why invest in production so that they can lower the price again? In fact with blanket tariffs, the risk is that demand collapses as people get squeezed and make due with their old scissors, and they producer has to cut production. This thought experiment has played out in reality, time and time again.  >The whole point of what I was saying is that this is far more complex than you are making it.  The whole thing about economics is that it both is and isn't so complex. The Knowledge Problem is real, and there are infinite factors that one person, or one group of people, cannot know. And yet there are things that just keep happening over and over to the point that they essentially become empirically derived laws. There are complex factors that will make a difference at the margins for individual cases, but in aggregate, we pretty much know certain things are going to happen.  >you are just as illiterate as the vast majority of people talking about this.  Ok.  >And what is worse is that you are so adamant that this ""Isn't conservative!"" and basically shaming everyone who is open to the idea.  I don't care if it is conservative except insofar as people claim it is conservative to try to justify it. I don't want to be poor because of government policy, whether that policy is conservative or liberal or whatever. I am genuinely mad about being poorer because of Trump 2.0 policy, following on the heels of Biden, and I think shame is an emotion that should make a comeback in American life.  >Further, if THOSE countries didn't tariff OUR cars as much, OUR car manufacturers would have tried to compete more in foreign nations.  Here's the thing, if Trump wants to use targeted tariffs as weapons to ultimately lower trade barriers, great. Even ramp them up against China to punish their actual unfair practices, like IP theft, regardless of whether they ever come back down.   These tariffs are being marketed as long-term policy to protect American industry and maybe we'll even eliminate the income tax. If the tariffs are going to replace other taxes, they need to be low enough that imports still come in at very high quantities. If they are going to protect feeble US industries, they need to be high enough to make importation prohibitive. They cannot be both.  And taxing coffee from Brazil, which we can't even grow here in large quantities, does not make US cars more attractive to Japanese consumers. There's no logic to blanket tariffs.",Moto302,2025-04-29T17:59:04,23
The issue is that there's little to no visibility on where this stuff is made and almost zero concern about the national security and economic concerns of letting China engage in IP theft in order to ripoff American companies.

"If the tariffs were just on China, I could see my way to supporting them. I think we should police IP theft much more fiercely. I think Trump should stop refusing to enforce the law that requires TikTok to sell or be shut down. I even think we should have a strategy to be less reliant on Taiwanese chips (even though our investment in chip manufacturers has been a boondoggle - Intel is based locally near me and they are not doing well despite huge government handouts).  That's what makes tariffing the rest of the world so dumb. We have a clear concern with China - we should be focusing on them with a consistent and aggressive policy. Instead we're paying more for Canadian goods because we have a trade imbalance entirely due to the fact that we negotiated a deal a long time ago to buy Canadian oil at below-market rates.",Moto302,2025-04-29T12:34:56,13
"Absolutely, and apparently nobody read your comment because it’s not an argument against transparency but against companies using tariff surcharges which are not actually representative of the actual tariffs they pay, similar to the random fees on your cable bill.  DigiKey is a pretty unique case and even with them the tariff charges are only estimates until they pack your order and send you a final invoice. Unlike Amazon they don’t throw the same products into one bin. Every time a part order gets prepacked, transferred between warehouses, picked and shipped it gets a new barcode label. I’ve had parts arrive with 3 or 4 different labels.  It’s pretty fascinating how they track all of this stuff in the material handling industry. If you ever look at an electronic component or packaged food item (among many other goods) and see a tiny square barcode that looks like a QR code but without squares in the corners, that’s called a [Data Matrix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix) and it’s the most common way to track items as they move through the supply chain from manufacturing all the way to shipment. In the US they pretty much all follow a standard called [ANSI MH10.8.6](https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/mhia/ansimh102013) so you can actually read them, though you’ll see a lot of internal identifiers in addition to production dates, order numbers, etc.  Thanks to those barcodes manufacturers and distributors can maintain real-time inventory levels and quickly facilitate product safety and quality recalls. That is if you’re buying from a reputable manufacturer of course, and with Amazon there’s no way to know that. They can’t be trusted to know anything about what they sell and where it came from, and they don’t want to know since they can use that argument to dodge product liability claims.",zip117,2025-05-01T13:44:57,2

"COL is *only* going to go up regardless because we have a 2% annual inflation target.  *REAL* Median household income rose from ~$65k in 2010 to ~$80k in 2023. The 2010 number is adjusted up to 2023 with inflation from ~$50k. In other words the average Joe is ~25% better off versus cost of living.  The housing issue is kind of its own thing and not really something that's going to be solved federally. This is completely unrelated to the tariff question outside the fact that tariffs necessarily will raise other costs and eat away at that 25% just like Biden's inflation did.  Edit: To put things in perspective, look at Canada. They've had NEGATIVE real median income growth. Their GDP per capita in 2011 97% of what it currently is now. Now, I know GDP isn't a great figure to use, but generally because it *overstates* how wealthy people are.

"No goalposts being moved on my end. Tariffs are bad policy except as temporary tools to punish bad actors. They shouldn't be used against allies. They shouldn't be applied as a blanket policy (that is not me specifying anything, this is what is actually occurring right now). And if you are going to be applying blanket tariffs, you shouldn't allow special interests to lobby for exemptions (again, this is what is actually happening).  We can come at this conversation a bunch of different ways, because there is no coherent plan outlined by the administration. Is it about leveling the playing field or raising revenue? Is it to force countries to the negotiating table or is it a long term plan? Whatever goal posts they want to kick through, go ahead, but they gotta pick one. It's killing investment, it's raising prices, it's alienating good partners.  I'm bitching because I'm getting poorer and Trump won't focus on the good things I want him to do.
