"In regards to saying he would end the Russian war on Ukraine on ‚Äúday one,‚Äù he claimed he hadn‚Äôt been speaking literally or seriously. ""I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible].

"Boy that Trump, what a comedian. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end the war.‚Äù Man, what a great joke. So clever. I mean‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt actually get the joke, but I assume it‚Äôs just so funny that it went over my head.   I do like his hair and makeup though.

"Remember the same shit on 2020 with the ""ingest bleach"" for COVID thing. Poison Control calls skyrocketed. His pundits and garglers spent a few days tripping over each other to try to come up with what very serious, very smart thing he ACTUALLY meant. And then he just came out with ""I was joking"".  What a leader. When the country is dealing with a crisis re: the health and safety of the nation, there's no better time to use a presser to work on a tight five for your routine",Yawgmoth13,2025-04-25T17:23:07,14
for someone with zero sense of humor he sure tells a lot of 'jokes',sharkcathedral,2025-04-25T17:28:49,7
"Didn't he literally admit that he only said drain the swamp because someone told him to and he thought it was dumb, but once it was popular he just kept saying it because people liked it and not because he meant it?  He literally just says whatever curries favor and gets him attention.",Dyde21,2025-04-25T21:51:36,7

After Day 1 he pretty much pivoted to endlessly whining ‚Äúit never would have happened if I‚Äôd been president‚Äù.,bassplayerguy,2025-04-25T17:56:03,1
But guys for real right?  if he is just as much of a jester as you claim why are you trusting him with the nuclear codes?,SolarDynasty,2025-04-25T18:50:54,1

How many times did Biden say he would end the war?,Educational-Pride940,2025-04-25T23:36:41,1
trump is a fucking clown and bull shitter.  24 hours have come and gone.   Now Putin is making him look like the fool he is.  trump will give Putin everything just so he can say he ended the war.   He is willing to fuck the entire country of Ukraine so he can get a damn headline.,Glad-Attempt5138,2025-04-26T00:47:58,1
It doesn't matter he will claim all the success as his own.,Junior-Addendum88,2025-04-26T01:40:58,1
"If only the MSM was capable of confronting him and holding his feet to the fire and never not mentioning how he's a felon who is either wrong or lying about things pretty much all the time.

Take him seriously not literally bro,Life_One_6012,2025-04-26T02:02:10,1
"Had Trump been asked, and maybe he already was, during all these claims if he was exagerratng or using some other kind of metaphore or sarcasm is there any doubt he would have said no.  The press needs to start clarifying every wild claim he makes by confirming it's not exaggeration or trolling.",aijoe,2025-04-26T02:17:53,1
This man is a liar and  pathetic joke !,Takemetothelevey,2025-04-26T04:01:16,1

Idiot thought he would just call his buddy Putin up and get a quick win. Guess his friendship with Putin was a little more one sided than Trump believed?,lelio98,2025-04-26T14:49:14,1

The walk back he's performed on the Ukraine topic makes all these headlines about 'revelations at the Popes funeral' with Zelensky strange. Im betting there's a changeup by the Monday news cycle.,citizenjones,2025-04-26T21:46:48,1

You mean the same guy who couldn‚Äôt run a casino‚Ä¶ or a university‚Ä¶ a vodka company‚Ä¶ a steak company‚Ä¶ or pay his contractors‚Ä¶ and owes money to multiple cities for his campaigns?   The guy who looked directly at the sun during an eclipse with no eye protection‚Ä¶ and suggested that we could cure Covid by injecting sunlight or bleach into our bodies? The guy who skipped out on his four seasons speech because it was booked at the four seasons garden center?   The same guy who just said that he made over 200 tariff deals and couldn‚Äôt name a single country with whom he supposedly struck a deal with?   Mr. I‚Äôll end the Ukraine war within 24 hours?

"It's also insane how many MAGA people think ""he's just trolling"" is ever an appropriate justification.              If Obama was in his second term and starting selling ""Obama 2016""  hats, after ""joking"" about running for a third term over and over for years, I guarantee conservatives wouldn't just go ""oh, it's OK, Obama is just trolling, no need to be outraged about this at all.""",5510,2025-04-25T20:51:07,9

"Do you believe public figures should be free to make false claims without accountability? Fact-checking is a cornerstone of democracy, it ensures that misinformation doesn‚Äôt go unchecked and helps those less engaged with the news discern truth from falsehoods.

"In other words all the signs of someone who was spoilt rotten as a kid and grew up assuming that he could do or say whatever he likes - including lie, cheat, rape, break all the laws - and completely get away with it.

"Mostly I would stop reporting on what he says as it carries essentially zero news value.  It seems odd to keep reporting things we all know to be lies in some sort of credulous fashion only to later be like ‚Äòwe busted him!‚Äô.

"Ah yes. The president of the United States, supposedly the most powerful and influential man on earth lies so commonly that instead of being angry about it, people just shrug and say ‚ÄûMeh, it‚Äôs Trump whatcha gonna do‚Äú.

I just explained how it would help.¬†,eskimospy212,2025-04-26T09:09:59,1
No argument here that he shouldn‚Äôt be president.  I‚Äôm just saying that he lies constantly and generally speaking people see the lies far more than the fact checks so the sum total of this is further misinforming people.¬†,eskimospy212,2025-04-26T09:20:43,1
