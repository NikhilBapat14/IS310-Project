"The proposal would include a ""Break The Law Free"" card in the form of mandatory lists of which Federal regulatory offenses would be prosecuted. It would be open season for any criminal regulatory violations not on the enforcement list.  ""The executive order would have agencies publicly post a list of regulatory violations that can trigger criminal charges, and guidance on the circumstances under which they would refer violators for prosecution.""  ""The order would discourage prosecutors from filing charges not on the lists, and charges that do not require prosecutors to prove the defendant had criminal intent. One such law has been used to prosecute executives for misbranded or adulterated food and drugs.""  ""The order would not apply to immigration or national security.""  © 2025 Reuters.

"So let me get this straight. As the Trump administration continues tightening its grip around the necks of ""every day Americans"" and vulnerable groups in particular, he's also providing get out of jail free cards to executives who skirt the law.   Oh, and all while conveniently disguising it as some kind of boon to ""small businesses."" And small businesses mind you, that Trump continues to harm with his trade and economic policies, and his policies that are eliminating opportunities and protections for those same businesses.  Ya...

Who besides Trump and the companies that will be getting away with basically murder thinks this is good idea? And why doesn’t that matter? Will the majority of people ever stand up and do anything about any of this?   America literally just sitting back and watching this unfold like a bad Netflix series and hoping it’s not gonna last,Green_Tomato_7444,2025-05-09T23:57:31,4
">Trump's order is meant to ease the burden on small businesses that do not have the same compliance resources as large corporations, according to a draft the official shared.  If you don't have ""compliance resources"" you shouldn't be in business. By this logic, if I create an LLC I'm entitled to start a waste removal company and dump it all in my backyard. Better yet, on public lands.   But! You can't prosecute me, because I don't have the resources to comply with these burdensome regulations!",spark3h,2025-05-10T00:48:33,6

It already happened ten dead due to Trump de regulation from his first term   https://apnews.com/article/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria-208ee7005b36ba17242fc4872746b268,yoppee,2025-05-09T23:34:34,15
"Yes, you are 100% correct. I'm sure Trump and his rich oligarch owners laugh at the base for being stupid and (by their standard) poor working stiffs, losers and suckers.  As an additional fillip *\[I looked up the definition\]*, Trump named prosperity gospel heretic Paula White-Cain as Senior Advisor to the White House Faith Office. White-Cain goes the prosperity gospel one step worse, by claiming the poor are poor because they are punished by God. So there is no reason for the blessed rich folk to help the evil poor. I'm not being sarcastic, and if that doesn't turn the Gospel of Jesus Christ completely on its head, I don't know what does.  White-Cain also sells blessings on her web site for a minimum donation of $1,000. And if you don't go along with her mob-like extortion racket, she threatens the God will punish you. ""Yeah, nice soul you got here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it"". That's Trump's Spiritual Advisor.",Nerd-19958,2025-05-10T12:02:28,1

"It’s getting hard to stay positive when it’s become clear no one is gonna fight for us. We all talk about Trumps dereliction of duty and complete lack of adherence to his oath of office, but all the current politicians in office, save for maybe a handful, are just as equally responsible. I don’t give a shit about the numbers and that they don’t control anything. Stand up and show the people you at least understand what’s happening. Don’t vote to confirm anything. Don’t give them any votes on anything. Make them pass everything without you. Waste time when votes are being cast. Take up space, make hearings and confirmation votes take more time. Make them a spectacle. At least go down fighting instead of capitulating on everything.   If we don’t completely remake the Democratic Party to truly reflect the lefts ideals, we’re gonna be left with just 2 different versions of the same fascist bullshit. Run by billionaires and multinational corporations. Some same we’ve already been there for while. It’s just so gross and absolute diservice to everyone who’s ever fought and served for anything for this country   It’s not a popular opinion, but the Pelosis, Schumers, Bidens, Newsoms, etc are just as equally responsible in my eyes. Not because they believe the same stuff, but their absolute inability to rise to the occasion   I’m so tired of backing blue no matter what. I want a legit other option",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-05-10T01:30:54,4
