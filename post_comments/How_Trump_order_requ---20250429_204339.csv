"“Jaime Garcia, another truck driver, expressed his concerns, saying, ""I don't think it's fair for the other. There are a lot of people who don't speak English. That's the way they provide for their families. So I don't think it's fair. Why do you have to speak English just to drive a truck?""  Let’s think, maybe being able to communicate with LEO would be a start.  Then they can deal with weigh stations better.  And if (when) they come cross those big light up roadside signs that mention a road closure, or a detour, all that stuff for which there isn’t a standard sign - they understand.   Note the “it’s not fair!”, the rallying  cry of the left. If I moved to say, Germany, and I wanted to do be a truck driver and found out that it required a decent understanding of basic German, I would feel compelled to simply go forth and learn some German.  Their country, their rules.",cliffotn,2025-04-29T21:04:24,59
"""Why do you have to speak English just to drive a truck?""   ---- SIMPLE all the road signs are in ENGLISH, so knowing ENGLISH means you can follow those traffic regulations!!!",DJSpawn1,2025-04-29T23:34:56,33
I would honestly rather have a non English speaking worker that’s a citizen over someone who collects welfare checks,Icant_concentrate,2025-04-29T22:32:29,17
"I mean, you also likely have to interact with people when loading and unloading too. It’s not like drivers pull up in front of a business, honk their horn twice, and then a bunch of dudes come running out to unload their trailer no questions asked.",Sgthouse,2025-04-30T04:52:51,8
"If you're a citizen of the U.S., or wanting to become one, you can be expected to learn English.  Duolingo is literally for free, and will teach you a level of language comprehension that's enough for day-to-day life, and working as a trucker.  Nobody is expecting these people to recite the works of Heminway by heart. It's about basics.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-30T04:21:40,11
How about requiring English to become a citizen or to get a visa?,letmeinfornow,2025-04-30T05:16:13,6
"Im addition, there is lots of communication done. Some via CB. Some via other channels such as official log books and government rules.",Tough_guy22,2025-04-30T06:50:04,3
That already is a requirement to become a naturalized citizen.,Vektor0,2025-04-30T07:17:52,0
It wasn't a requirement when I became one. I see people all the time they get their citizenship that do not know a word of English and require translators to get through the process.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-30T07:42:41,1
"https://www.usa.gov/naturalization  > Able to read, write, and speak basic English (depending on age)",Vektor0,2025-04-30T11:09:19,2
They clearly do not enforce it.  Or at least didn't in the past.  Needs to be mandatory with no exceptions.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-30T11:56:25,1
