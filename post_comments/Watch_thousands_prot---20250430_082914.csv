"She saved a critical economic engine and potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs by taking advantage of Trump's likely attraction to her. You are all letting Trump win in making that shit out like some kind of bending of the knee. It wasn't. She didn't endorse him. She did something fucking gross because it was her duty as our governor to do so -- she worked to mitigate the damage as best she could.      I'm not convinced everyone blasting her for this shit has never shaken hands with someone they don't like because it was expedient to do so.      She has done good for Michigan. That's her job.

"Michigan is a mixed bag, rural bumfuk MI voters are heavily DJT but metros areas are not. We have a Dem governor and a prominent progressive Dem Secretary of State.

You say that when it'd easy to say but this is one of those things I think is a lot easier to romanticise about than to actually follow through on.      Ya ever been sexually assaulted? I have. Would I have liked to tell the other party to fuck off and start a fight in the moment? Absolutely. Was the other party almost twice as big as I am and I knew that fighting carried the risk of additional harm? Also yes. Those are calculated decisions. Hopefully you don't have to deal with making a similar choice ever because it fucking sucks.,PM_ME_YOUR_BOOGER,2025-04-30T14:16:12,-1

"When my abusive father would get half an inch from my face and scream at me before grabbing me by the nape of the neck and jostling me because I dared stand my ground when I was fourteen I didn‚Äôt shrink away and allow him access to my sisters to do the same. Giving these people what they want is losing.   The only way to win is to force them into taking it too far, to the point others are no longer allowed and able to pretend nothing is going on.   You talk like we do think this is easy, or that we are all weak, or that none of us have gone through worse than what you think you have gone through.   Some of us have. Some of us are willing to do it even though it isn‚Äôt easy.   My heart goes out to you that you were abused and mistreated and that your friends and the community you immerse yourself in *failed* you. That‚Äôs terrible.   This is also terrible. This is currently destroying lives. This is currently killing people. This is currently happening and I‚Äôm willing to say I absolutely would not and do not believe it is okay to keep making ‚Äúcalculated decision‚Äù to allow this abuser to keep abusing.   I‚Äôm likely to end up dead or deported by the end of this regime. I have preexisting medical conditions, rely on welfare, and am currently houseless and poor. That doesn‚Äôt stop me. Me being killed and deported is one more stick on the pile that might get some fence sitters to take action.   That‚Äôs the reality. It doesn‚Äôt matter that *you* think the choices available are too hard to make. They will only get harder as more of our rights and precedent erode away.",ChilledParadox,2025-04-30T15:02:36,8
"When you say, ""safe"", do you mean same from being trafficked to foreign prisons? Because here's the thing, trump, who is a narcissist and authoritarian fascist, cannot be trusted.
