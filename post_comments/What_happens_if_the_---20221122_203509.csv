"They vote again and again and again until a majority of *everyone* agrees. It's non-partisan in actuality. Also they can vote simply 'present' instead of for a candidate, and it's included in the vote totals. So attendance is important. There is precedent. There was a session a hundred years ago where it was months and many, many rounds of voting before the whole House agreed in majority, regardless of party. I don't have the resources, but this is well defined. And, there were articles discussing the scope of it after the 2016 election when the leading candidate then as now faced the prospect of a slim majority.",mandy009,2022-11-23T14:42:30,29
"Technically the speaker is chosen by a majority of individuals in the House, not by which ever party has a majority. But since the U.S. only has 2 major political parties, it just turns out that the party with a majority gets to decide the Speaker.  The only way a Democrat could become the Speaker is if a few Republicans ALSO voted for the Democrat. The Speaker is decided upon by a simple Majority, so I don't see a realistic way that a Democrat can become Speaker while the Republicans have the Majority.",Heckle_Jeckle,2022-11-23T16:58:15,8
"I think the scenario is technically possible, although I can guarantee that either party in that situation would nominate a literal jellyfish to be speaker of the house before they allowed the other party to vote someone in.",Blear,2022-11-23T14:04:38,13
"Without a speaker the House of Representatives cannot function. When the newly elected house first convenes the clerk of the House will call the members to order. One by one the clerk will call on each member to vote by surname for the speaker. If no person receives the majority the whole process starts all over again. If no one is chosen the process will repeat itself, sometimes for weeks.  The most extreme case comes from [1855](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-longest-and-most-contentious-Speaker-election-in-its-history/) when 21 different candidates ran for the speakership. In that year the House was able to choose a speaker after 133 rounds of voting over the course of 2 months.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-11-23T17:44:23,5
"Is it majority of the house, or majority of those present for the vote?",chiliedogg,2022-11-23T20:31:57,2
"I mean, if there are enough far right republicans who refuse to vote for McCarthy (3 or 4 have already said they won’t vote for him under “any circumstances), wouldn’t one possible way forward be the democrats agreeing to vote for him in exchange for some concessions (some committee chairmanships, for example)? It doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility that the concessions McCarthy would have to make to the democrats would be more palatable than the concessions he’d have to make to the far right of his own party.",deaconater,2022-11-23T14:08:43,11
Very interesting. I wasn’t aware the clerk had such an important role. Nor that the house basically cannot function without a speaker. When and how was this process established? It’s not in the constitution right?,deaconater,2022-11-23T19:16:17,3
"I mean, theoretically the dems could get a handful of gop on board and make anyone the Speaker, even someone who isn't even in the House.  It just won't ever happen is all.",[deleted],2022-11-23T16:30:44,8
"Honestly, I could really see that. Whether it goes as far as that I don't know but certainly the possibility or the threat of that happening could be on the table to bring those radical Republicans back in line on this issue if nothing else",Blear,2022-11-23T14:16:11,7
"You're right, the process I described above is not in the Constitution. According to my old copy of the *House Rules and Manual* the speaker was originally elected by paper ballots. The current method of members voting by voice during a roll call started in 1839. The procedure is also codified in the *House Rules* which state in Rule II 2(a):  >At the commencement of the first session of each Congress, the Clerk shall call the Members, Delegates, and Resident Commissioner to order and proceed to record their presence by States in alphabetical order, either by call of the roll or by use of the electronic voting system. **Pending the election of a Speaker or Speaker pro tempore, and in the absence of a Member acting as Speaker pro tempore pursuant to clause 8(b)(3)(A) of rule I, the Clerk shall preserve order and decorum and decide all questions of order, subject to appeal by a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner**.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-11-24T00:02:39,1
"What would happen is that they'd make an agreement with him, then after he was elected he'd say, what agreement?",JohnOliverismysexgod,2022-11-23T20:40:51,1
