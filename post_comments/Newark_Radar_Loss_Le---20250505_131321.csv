Did anyone else read the story yesterday about a controller warning people to stay away from Newark? Just me?,palenerd,2025-05-05T13:21:56,31
"From Bloomberg News reporter [Allyson Versprille](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASABP2XGsYo/allyson-versprille):  Air traffic controllers guiding planes bound for [Newark Liberty International Airport](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0676503D:US) lost radar and radio communication for more than a minute early last week before flights at the key hub were snarled for days, according to people familiar with the matter.  The outage of those key systems occurred on April 28 and lasted nearly 90 seconds, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the matter because it isn’t public. Following the incident, multiple employees were placed on trauma leave, the people said.  The incident and resulting reduction in staffing contributed to a week of flight delays and cancellations at Newark airport that pushed [United Airlines Holdings Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UAL:US) to cut 35 daily round trips at the key hub, its biggest for international departures and a primary gateway for domestic flights.  The details, which haven’t previously been reported, paint a dire picture of the shortcomings at the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0238301Z:US) operation in Philadelphia that guides flights into and out of Newark. The facility there has experienced a number of technology failures, said the people. When radar or radio frequencies stop working, there are no fail-safes, one of the people said, meaning controllers must simply wait for the system to come back online.",bloomberg,2025-05-05T13:13:53,10

90 seconds is an amazingly long time to be flying around blind in airplane flight. No wonder some of the ATC needed some trauma leave.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-05-05T13:49:58,7
In its earliest days of service the airport was known as the most dangerous in America.  Three tragic rashes in something like three months.,Click_To_Submit,2025-05-05T13:33:01,3

Somehow this feels like a play for Elmo to take control of the aviation systems. I do not trust these people and cynical as hell. But he wants to grab everything and this admin is one big grift.,123-Moondance,2025-05-06T07:30:25,1
