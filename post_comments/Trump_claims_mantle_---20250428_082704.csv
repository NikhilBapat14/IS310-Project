"This is just a stupid thing to write.  Do they not realize that Trumpists and MAGAians aren't go to read past a title? Hell, some of them would just look at a few words and paint their own mental picture of the article.  Trump's name shouldn't be used near FDR's except to say how vastly incompetent Trump is as compared to FDR.",ImmoKnight,2025-04-28T08:30:04,12

"Since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s earthshaking first 100 days in office, no president has matched the sheer drama and disruption of that 15-week sprint in 1933, which rewrote the relationship between Americans and their government. At least until now.  President Donald Trump’s opening barrage has similarly upended government operations, disturbed traditions and even raised new questions about what it means to be American. It is no accident that Trump has repeatedly cited Roosevelt as a model when it comes to his impact and place in history.  But as Trump’s 100-day mark arrives Tuesday, the differences are at least as stark as the similarities. Roosevelt’s onslaught, in the depths of the Great Depression, was aimed at expanding the federal government’s presence in Americans’ lives. Trump’s crusade is aimed largely at dismantling it.  Perhaps more crucially, Congress came together to pass more than a dozen major laws in Roosevelt’s first 100 days, reflecting the wide national eagerness for his revolution. Trump, in contrast, has governed largely by unilateral executive action, which enables to him to ignore his opponents but avoids a broad political consensus — and leaves his actions more vulnerable to reversal.
