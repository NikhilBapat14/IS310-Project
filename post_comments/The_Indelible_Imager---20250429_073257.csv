"From the economy to foreign policy, Trump has had a 100-day stretch unlike any recent president, bending US institutions to his will and remaking America’s standing in the world.    There has been chaos, confusion and, among Trump’s fervent base, celebration. Yet overall, his approval ratings over this span are lower than any president in seven decades, declining to 41% according to a [CNN poll](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/politics/approval-rating-trump-100-days/index.html).    All the while, Trump has been the everywhere president, dominating since the November election. Image has always been everything to Trump, who assembled a camera-ready cabinet straight out of “central casting.” And over his time in public life, Trump has consistently tried to sell himself and create a narrative of absolute power, authority and competence using imagery.
