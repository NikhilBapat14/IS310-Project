It’s funny how liberals forget that jimmy kimmel was on the Man Show. That show would trigger all the liberals. Trampolines and boobs.  ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-30T14:38:07,41
Glad to hear it. Something must be going right if these people are all pissed off.,ILikestoshare,2025-04-30T13:02:47,61
I have a better title: The insufferable beta hosts know their days on tv are numbered and the only way to keep it alive is to talk about Trump,Zealousideal-Dig8210,2025-04-30T13:07:15,31

I'd be very disappointed in Trump if liberals were happy with him.,No_Bowler_3286,2025-04-30T13:19:28,16

This is one of the indications that President Trump is doing the right things.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-30T14:06:19,2

As if anyone watches late night shows after they went full idiot.,wanttostaygottogo,2025-05-01T08:22:34,1
How many people are still watching late night tv hosts anyway? They stopped being funny years ago. I would rather watch a documentary on socks.,Szorja,2025-05-02T11:55:08,1

"Its been 100 days....We had 4 years of nothing burgers with Biden and I didn't hear this guy say a peep.   I would hope that the US Presidency would have a longer ""probationary period"" to determine performance than a stock boy at Target. I feel its unfair to judge long term decisions over their immediate impacts. That said, the Unites States people voted for significant change and it would seem to me, despite some noise, that change is being effectuated so wouldn't that mean he is successful at least partially?    Why isn't Jimmy commenting on the radical shift in race and identity politics? Why isn't Jimmy talking about our absolute control over the border or how quickly we are moving against illegal immigrants responsible for horrible crimes?  Why only focus on the things that haven't come to fruition and ignore the major accomplishments that have materialized? Does Jimmy benefit from encouraging controversy?  Sure, there are some criticisms to be made, Trump isn't infallible and some things like the economy are going to take time to develop for us to determine his effectiveness and these things are a gamble. However, to declare he isn't doing a good job changing years worth of dumb shit in his first 100 days in office seems premature at best and straight up disingenuous at worst. If anything given the intensity of change being thrown around it makes me more hopeful that he is going to continue to push us in the right direction.",philthy069,2025-04-30T15:41:33,-3
