">*It was not clear how the people granted refugee status proved persecution*  Figures as the persecution complex is a way of life for rightwing regressives throughout the world, it's how they justify - to themselves mostly - their bigoted, racist belief systems and horrible treatment of others.  Funny how in that pic the white racist motherfuckers all have that same hate-filled MAGA ""aura"" about them.  And Trump, the orange headcase and illegitimate potus with this latest act is demonstrating - as usual - that he is a vile, viciously racist, ignorant MFer. Both he and the MAGA movement deserve each other.",haiku2572,2025-05-09T09:40:20,14

"Importing white South Africans and fast tracking them through the system at breakneck speeds + encouraging white women to have more babies + erasing Black history + firing and layoff thousands of workers from the federal government, a lot of whom are Black women + making it more difficult for Black people to get ahead by removing anti-discrimination practices + making it harder for people, especially Black people to go to college + crying DEI if a Black person gets hired for any job and implying that all Black people are incompetent =  trying to mitigate 2045 non Hispanic white minority projections   Hmm, I wonder who cooked this up? Perhaps the apartheid loving South African foreigner that came in a mucked everything and has slithered away and will reemerge in one month hoping people will have forgotten what a piece of shit he is.",Historical_Dream_480,2025-05-09T10:32:15,7
"i'm kinda surprised that this isn't making bigger headlines. it's bizarre and outrageous especially in the context of the ongoing manhunt for ""illegal"" immigrants who have been quietly living and working in the USA for decades.  does anybody still believe that this administration is not the most racist and fascist clusterfuck of all times in the USA? they really miss segregation apparently.",JenkinsHowell,2025-05-09T10:51:10,6

"Molly Conger's [Weird Little Guys](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-weird-little-guys-201395214/) podcast has done a great job covering the myth of the persecuted white South African and how this bullshit has been pushed by white supremacists for decades.  Highly recommended.  It's not a current events podcast, but just a well-produced/written show that does bios on the usually-small-time weirdos trying to push the white power narrative and/or commit violence toward that cause.  Unfortunately, this crap has started really impacting current events more than she expected.  Also: r/weirdlittleguys",Grantagonist,2025-05-09T10:25:40,1
