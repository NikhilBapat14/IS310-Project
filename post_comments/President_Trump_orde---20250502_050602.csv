"Really just the rich being spiteful that they want less in taxes. Being sold under this umbrella that they can’t control every last word/thought being generated, so they should try to kill it.",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-05-02T05:29:46,4
"To the MAGA cult: your time is coming to an end. Trump’s reign won’t last forever, and those of you enabling his authoritarian nonsense will face accountability. We are Americans — we don’t tolerate wannabe dictators or fascist behavior. Cutting funding for NPR and PBS isn’t just shameful — it’s a blatant attempt to manipulate the media and silence independent voices to push Trump’s agenda.",johnnyutah_987,2025-05-02T07:17:15,4
"Anyone who is a ""viewer like you"" can donate to their local PBS or NPR stations to help offset operational costs! Easily the best value streaming service through PBS for a $60 donation a year (atleast to the station I donate to).",sugarcwonder,2025-05-02T08:41:34,3

Then what will they support if not the prime CPB programs?  Probably force them to support OAN or some crap.,Andovars_Ghost,2025-05-02T12:26:10,1
"Whatever. PBS and NPR are welcome to move to New England, and work out of WNPR in Boston.",mfeldmannRNE,2025-05-02T07:18:32,1
"Although it is difficult to keep up with all this evil administration is doing, nothing surprises me.",Justonemorestraw,2025-05-02T05:41:52,3
"Sadly I agree. It's literally the opposite of what you would expect a president to do if he was actually trying to ""Make America Great Again""... which wouldn't really have been necessary had he not fucked it up.",tlinteau,2025-05-02T07:08:33,2
