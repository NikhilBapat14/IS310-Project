"Gang violence is political in the sense that anything concerning structures of power is political.  A criminal organization whose income is tied to their territories will want to expand. The more territory, the more customers for their services and the more clients under their ""protection."" In a city with multiple gangs, turf wars will occur when changes in relative strength or new opportunities upset the status quo.",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-07-14T15:14:34,20
"As ""We Live In A Society"" as this sounds, literally all politics, including the kind I support, is so called ""gang violence.""   Every society gets the criminals it deserves.",[deleted],2023-07-14T15:28:47,5
Yes they often rat out opposing gangs to get law enforcement to take them down in power grabs,tuna_tofu,2023-07-17T08:04:47,2
"Crips & bloods are basically a kind of nationalism that emerges on a micro-scale. You're born in a particular neighborhood and you must wear a particular color to rep your hood / show loyalty / pledge allegiance. Your gang is like an army to ""protect"" you against neighboring gangs you don't trust.  Besides bloods/crips, there are other types of gangs that are more exclusive (cult-like instead of nation-like).",le256,2023-08-18T12:13:19,1
