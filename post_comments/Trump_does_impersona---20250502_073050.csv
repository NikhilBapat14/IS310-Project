It does take some of the Right wing rhetoric off the table though re the 'man/boy' completing in woman/girl sports that you mention.

"I'm from the UK and know some different people whose grown up children have moved there.  They report it's lovely and it's a great idea to raise children as free as possible from social media.      Every approach has it's pros and cons but a childhood without  malevolent social media where at all possible has got to be better. Free of  its bullying, it's damaging impossible images to live up to. It's algorithms as you say.      Also,  Gun violence in Aus has  decreased to an incomparable level compared to America.  Stemming way back from the 1996 Port Arthur massacre and its subsequent reforms. Not just homicides down but suicides by guns too. In the UK, I never worry about getting shot or the need to defend myself. It doesn't mean there aren't possible dangers, e.g. knife crime, but gun power is so much different in its devastation.  It sounds almost bizarre to have a childhood free of social media now, but it's happening there. Children will of course find ways, but when access to anything is limited it usually decreases its possibilites exponentially, like the gun reforms in Aus did.     I agree with you, if you can make that move do it for sure.
