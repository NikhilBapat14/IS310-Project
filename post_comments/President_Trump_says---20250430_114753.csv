"So instead of continuing to say it isn't possible, he openly declares he's going to ignore a court order?  I get that a Republican Congress won't do anything about it, neither will his own Justice Department, but goddamn it's a bad look to just say to hell with the Supreme Court.",cathbadh,2025-04-30T18:52:32,472

"For the sake of discussion, lets assume that ""they""  brought him back.   The deportation orders still stand.... He would just be put in ICE detention and deported to some country other than El Salvador.   He has already had due process and appeals.  Why spend the money to take an ES citizen, bring them to the U.S., just to deport them to somewhere else. (where, arguably they will be worse off than in their home country.)  ?",ronaldbeal,2025-04-30T17:34:33,-11
"Good lord lol who the f cares. Idk what I'm missing but illegal gang member being deported, a great day.   The down votes around here are something. Imagine wasting your time on that sheesh.",Casty_Who,2025-04-30T21:04:52,-6

This is exactly what we need. A leader who isn't scared to do what it takes to secure our border!,MFN_blessthefall,2025-04-30T14:33:23,-9
Yeah but how hilarious would it be to ship him back here and than...within 1 hour....immediately deport him back,CantSeeShit,2025-04-30T23:29:09,1
"If a judge ordered you to facilitate bringing a violent criminal into your home, would you?",No_Bowler_3286,2025-04-30T13:08:00,-22
"Lol obviously. All the ""gee, golly, shucks, simply nothing we can do"" stuff was just to troll leftists. A lot of them seem to mistakenly believe that Trump was trying to avoid ""legal liability"", even though of course what he did was legal.  The reality is that no judge is going to put Trump or one of his lawyers behind bars for this. That is never going to happen. We won.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-30T13:35:04,-18
He’s a terrorist. He should be locked up and STAY locked up. President Trump is making the correct decision.,gorbdocbdinaofbeldn,2025-05-01T00:33:54,-7

"The decision ultimately rests with El Salvador, he's their citizen residing in their country. They don't have to turn him over to the US.   That said, Trump could call Bukele and he'd likely listen. That's what he meant with this statement.   If anyone were to really press him over this comment, he could make a ""formal"" request with a wink and a nudge.",Material-Afternoon16,2025-04-30T21:34:03,-67
He means he could exercise diplomatic coercion and get it done; but that is an area the courts even the Supreme Court lacks constitutional authority to order the executive to do,Racheakt,2025-05-01T05:33:20,-13
"Lol, no.  As long as this is in the news it’s a ginormous win for Trump and republicans.  I mean this dudes rep has gotten so bad the libs may want to actually back away slowly.  But nope, he just reeled them in for another 72 hours of news.",n337y,2025-04-30T21:15:15,-22
"He should be shouting this from the rooftops. America voted for mass remigration, America voted to return Mr. Garcia to his homeland of sunny El Salvador.  The Democrats want to hitch their wagon to him, so let them. Even Carville has abandoned talking about the economy in favor of defending this guy. Show America what the Democrats stand for.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-30T17:56:30,-62

It is always about the rule of law. It is literally a foundation of the social contract. Without it we will descend into California.,Kahnspiracy,2025-04-30T23:16:04,25
"> Why spend the money to take an ES citizen, bring them to the U.S., just to deport them to somewhere else. (where, arguably they will be worse off than in their home country.)  Because the US Supreme Court ordered it through their legitimate, lawful, Constitutional ability?",cathbadh,2025-04-30T18:53:36,130
"Trump says he can bring him back if he wanted to. And he's right. We're paying El Salvador millions to house these people. Threatening to cut aid would do it.  Regardless, the issue here is Trump shooting himself in the foot once again.  He was ordered to facilitate the man's return. His administration said it was impossible. Now he says he can do it.  That will be brought up when Garcia's lawyers go back to court and ask why the court order is being ignored.",cathbadh,2025-05-01T06:26:52,32
"They're so mentally broken by Trump winning again, it's hilarious. They don't want to face what that means for the world's future, so they'd rather create a comforting alternate reality to shelter in where they think Trump voters have ""had enough"" and that impeachment is right around the corner.  In reality, Mr. Garcia will never be returning to America. He migrated here illegally and is barred from return. Most Americans support this.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-30T19:10:02,-29
So which law matters? And who should it protect? We have 20 million people permitted to break ours by the same people who are trying to delay their departure.,sixtysecdragon,2025-05-01T03:10:00,9
"Technically, they ordered the administration to facilitate, and not to effectuate.  Seems like a weakly worded opinion to say they said something, but who's to judge the proper extent of ""facilitation,"" especially since Bukele says he's not releasing him",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-30T19:11:43,-15
"A very valid question. Very valid. All laws matter and when there is conflict it up to the courts to decide how to handle it. They will kick things back to the legislative bodies to resolve or figure out how to balance the laws.  Edit: Also, if the people/legislature doesn't like how it was resolved, the law(s) can be changed, or in extreme cases where bad faith is suspected, judges can be impeached.",Kahnspiracy,2025-05-01T10:28:03,2
"Facilitate means they need to at least do something. Him and Bukele both saying it couldn't happen should have been the end of it. But this statement kinda scrrws that.  Sigh, I see the bots have deemed my post sufficiently anti Trump enough for up votes and yours too pro Trump and thus needing downvotes despite both of us making clear points.",cathbadh,2025-05-01T07:07:03,5
