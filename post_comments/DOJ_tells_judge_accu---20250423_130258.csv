"Children under 6yo taken to court without legal representation: but look, they have the opportunity to contest!",Legitimate_Eye8494,2025-04-23T13:18:06,17
"I don’t know if it would ever happen because there are pros and cons in doing it…..but,  Should the supreme court sit shoulder to shoulder and simply read the letter of the law in front of cameras, make no political statements, no references to any cases and then give a dumbed down synopsis of what the law means for those in the back.   The trump administration will whine it was crafted simply to make trump lol bad and the constitution is just a piece of liberal propaganda because of “reasons” and there is no indication that it will change magas mind because we have been doing this for 10 years and nothing penetrates those thick skulls.",i-have-a-kuato,2025-04-23T13:28:54,6

"“DOJ tells judge” and not the other way around is all you need to know about where this country is going. Good luck judges, you are all about to become irrelevant.",f1del1us,2025-04-23T16:53:47,1
