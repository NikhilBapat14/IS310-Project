Self-confidence involves a positive belief that one can generally accomplish what one wishes to do in the future.[2] **Self-confidence is not the same as self-esteem,** which is an evaluation of one's worth.   [Wikipedia]Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, socioeconomic status, significant emotional experiences, *social stigma,*  [Wikipedia]Social stigmas can occur in many different forms. The most common deal with culture, gender, race, religion, illness and disease. ",GiediOne,2025-04-15T15:54:29,3
