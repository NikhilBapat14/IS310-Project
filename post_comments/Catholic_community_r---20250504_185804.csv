‚ÄúCan you believe that orange twat disrespected us by posting an image of him as pope?‚Ä¶what‚Äôs that? A 60yo priest is being transferred to our parish and we‚Äôre not allowed to ask him why he‚Äôs being transferred? Ok!‚Äù,pitterlpatter,2025-05-04T21:48:48,9
">Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, denied the post was offensive. When conservative commentator Bill Kristol wrote on X, ""Hey, @JDVance, you fine with this disrespect and mocking of the Holy Father?"" the vice president replied, ""As a general rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen.""  I gotta admit, that's a pretty good burn of Bill Kristol, one of the worst of the neocons.",redditor01020,2025-05-04T19:05:10,0

"It‚Äôs the mask they keep wearing that so silly to me. He was a means to power, just own it.  People want power. For themselves or their group it‚Äôs human. The deceit and the gaslighting, however is what I cannot deal with.  In their eyes, everything that happens under Trump is necessarily good. Nothing matters as long as Trump continues to Trump.",Rafflesrpx,2025-05-05T09:58:08,1
