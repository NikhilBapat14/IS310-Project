"Habeas corpus dates back to Magna Carta in 1215. After initially approving Magna Carta, King John tried to revoke it and regain his limitless powers.   He ended up losing the crown jewels while crossing a tidal estuary and then died of dysentery.  In short, King John was a big LOSER. No English monarch has been named John since him.
