This orange fuck is disgrace to the office. Faux news is already trying to make this look like hit job by the interviewer. Trump cannot handle being called out and has to turn to child like bullying. Good old rapist and chief...,Orposer,2025-04-30T00:42:23,774

" Trump then started mocking Moran. “That was Photoshopped? Terry, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime. You’re doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I’d never heard of you, but that’s OK,” Trump said. “You’re not being very nice.”  Moran again tried to move to another question, but Trump wasn’t having it.  “Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?”  “I saw the picture.”  Moran kept trying to move on — even saying “agree to disagree” — but Trump kept insisting: “No, no: He had ‘MS’ as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.’ This is why people no longer believe the news, because it’s fake news.”",dshock99,2025-04-30T00:58:11,198

"Honestly, he can't help it.  He has a mental disorder that does not allow him to be wrong.  Seriously, no hyperbole, the man is not well and should never have been considered a public servant.  He isn't capable. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is a mental health condition characterized by an excessive sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Individuals with NPD often have an inflated sense of their own abilities, achievements, and importance, and may be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, and beauty. They typically require excessive admiration and have a sense of entitlement, often exploiting others to achieve their own goals. A key feature of NPD is a lack of empathy, making it difficult for them to understand or share the feelings of others. Key characteristics of NPD include:  * **Grandiosity:** An exaggerated sense of self-importance, often with fantasies of unlimited success, power, beauty, or ideal love.  * **Need for Admiration:** A persistent need for excessive praise and attention from others.  * **Lack of Empathy:** Difficulty understanding or sharing the feelings and needs of others.  * **Sense of Entitlement:** Unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with their desires.  * **Exploitative Behavior:** Taking advantage of others to achieve their own goals.  * **Arrogance and Haughtiness:** Exhibiting a superior and condescending attitude. ",smiama36,2025-04-30T07:33:18,4

I don't think even most Trump supporters thought he literally had ""MS13"" tattooed on his knuckles. It was generally discussed in the context of interpreting his actual tattoos to have a hidden meaning.  They didn't add the text to try to trick people into thinking those were his actual tattoos. There were just a surprising number of conservatives, including Trump himself, who are so fucking stupid that they don't realize that text was just superimposed to show their interpretation of the tattoos.",veggeble,2025-04-30T10:17:43,1
"\> I don't think even most Trump supporters thought he literally had ""MS13"" tattooed on his knuckles. It was generally discussed in the context of interpreting his actual tattoos to have a hidden meaning.  Online, maybe... I'm too chickenshit to actually start polling my neighbors but in my estimate most Trump supporters in real life thought he literally had M S 1 3 tattooed on the knuckles. They saw a video, they didn't look at it the second time, etc.  \> They didn't add the text to try to trick people into thinking those were his actual tattoos. There were just a surprising number of conservatives, including Trump himself, who are so fucking stupid that they don't realize that text was just superimposed to show their interpretation of the tattoos.  But why would that number of conservatives be surprising? A lawyer or prosecutor would, I think, expect that sort of alteration to leave at least half a jury with an impression that there was literal M S 1 3 on the knuckles - as opposed to some other alteration where the text is outside the knuckles. I don't know about someone like Vance but he strikes me as the sort of person who built his entire political career on awkwardly pretending to be the kind of hillbilly that would think ""photoshop"" is a shop where you go to buy photos (I'm referring to his sparkling water anekdote).",dizekat,2025-04-30T11:05:18,1

"I dunno, when I first saw it back when he was showing it, I was like ""that's some really shitty photoshop... but its probably good enough"".   These folks are racist. You could probably put MS13 below the knuckles, and they would remember it as he had literal letters on his knuckles. People's memory works that way when they want something to be true.",dizekat,2025-04-30T12:30:05,1
