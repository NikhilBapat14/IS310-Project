I’ve got no doubt this guy is bad dude and connected to ms13 and needs to be gone. That abc interview was funny- Trump seems to certain that photo of his knuckles with the words ms13 were tattoos when they were clearly Arial font placed above the symbols on his knuckles.,Imaginary-Alfalfa403,2025-04-30T16:12:29,44

"One or more of these are cover up tattoos right?  It’s been showing up in my feed today, otherwise I wouldn’t really care.",Zeno_Stoic,2025-04-30T17:12:45,2
"Agree he should be gone, but should have been given due process first, as he was lawfully in the country.",check_your_bias7,2025-04-30T20:27:21,-2
"Why would they? They ostensibly have their base vote locked up, but that's cracking...  They're going all in on illegal immigrants because that's a future voter base that they need to secure",indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-30T15:27:56,9
"How was he lawfully in this country, exactly? He had no legal status here of any kind. The only thing preventing him from being sent to El Salvador was a withholding order. He could’ve been deported to any other country that would take him.",Szorja,2025-04-30T23:12:38,13
"I think only some people are locked to a party, no matter what, and that most people have common sense to realize, at some point, what is actually happening around.",AstraVolans_21,2025-05-01T05:06:14,1
"He was lawfully in the country in the sense that his deportation to El Salvador was denied by an immigration judge. In order to proceed with any other deportation, he would have needed to be given notice, and an opportunity to refute it (e.g. appearing before another immigration judge). The fact of the matter is, his deportation to El Salvador was denied, and no other avenues were pursued, thus he was lawfully residing in the U.S. at the time of his capture. ICE cannot overrule the judiciary.",check_your_bias7,2025-04-30T23:21:18,3
"Saying he was lawfully in the country is still a bit of a stretch. He was in immigration limbo via the withholding order. The judiciary was withholding him from being deported back to El Salvador. But he was still never granted asylum, no green card, nothing that would give him legal status to be here. And yes, obviously the withholding order was violated by deporting him, but he was not lawfully here.",Szorja,2025-04-30T23:44:27,6
I see what you mean. Perhaps a better way to phrase it would be 'it was unlawful to deport him to El Salvador',check_your_bias7,2025-05-01T09:06:02,5
