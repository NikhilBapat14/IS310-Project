"It's deeply troubling that Montana Republicans are trying to roll back climate action after a court recognized the state's constitutional duty to protect a clean environment, and to be honest, it makes you wonder, Montana, you know, holds the largest coal reserves in the US, and produces about 5% of the country's coal, so what's the *real* reason they're pushing these judiciary reform bills, beyond just saying they're fixing a problem with the courts? I mean, it's a question that really needs answering, because... it just seems like more than just fixing a perceived overreach. They need to be held accountable... I guess.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T08:03:03,13

"> Montana Republican Representative Greg Oblander,  said the case “was an open invitation for activists to weaponize our environmental laws against the very industries that keep Montana running and Montanans employed.”  Protecting industries that destroy the environment.  What a MAGAT thing to do.",nwgdad,2025-04-28T08:58:36,3
