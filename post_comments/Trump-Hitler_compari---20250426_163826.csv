" Trump is a dictator and this is fascism.  This isn't a what-about-ism comparison, but using accurate labels for the regime.   Trump 2.0 is almost indistinguishable from historical early fascist arcs like the Nazis so calling them out is important to everyone seeing what's going on.   There is a risk in softening people's response to such comparisons, but there's also a psychological narrative point where even average people who don't follow politics like we all do starts drawing a line between Trump and Hitler. Between MAGA and Nazis.   Trump's regime is on a PR campaign right now to try and regain the narrative of strength and his bullshit ""mandate"" and using the correct labels for their factual behavior is crucial.

"  https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/772/   >Typically, the majority will force a showdown only when the publicity in doing so is valuable in its own right. Thus, in 1988, when the Republican minority was stalling campaign finance reform legislation by refusing to attend floor sessions and the illnesses and travel schedules of five Democrats prevented the majority from obtaining a quorum, Majority Leader Byrd invoked the seldom used authority to have the Sergeant-at-Arms threaten to arrest absent senators to compel their attendance.   >When that failed, Byrd and the Democrats voted to order the Sergeant-at-Arms to arrest the absentees and return them to the chamber.   >In complying with this order, capital police officers captured Senator Robert Packwood, who had barricaded himself in his office, and carried him into the Senate chamber feet first. The whole spectacle hit the front page of the Washington Post, ***allowing Democrats to complain about the Republicans’ refusal to vote on legislation to clean up Congress and Republicans to complain about “Nazi” tactics***. Such confrontation is, however, quite rare. In most cases, the two-track system keeps filibusters out of the public eye.  >“The modern filibuster, by contrast, has little to do with deliberation and even less to do with debate. The modern filibuster is simply minority veto, and a powerful one at that. It is not part of a long Senate tradition and history alone cannot justify it.” - The Filibuster by Catherine Fisk, Erwin Chemerinsky    So here's the thing,  >“It’s so overdone at this point that I’m not sure it holds weight very much,” said a second GOP political strategist. “It’s a pretty lazy effort to just stir the anger instead of actually getting to the root of whatever your complaint is.”   The root of the god damn complaint is that Republicans are acting like Nazis. The problem Democrats have is that 77,000,000 DO NOT WANT TO KNOW that they are Nazis and that they support a Nazi government. They are willfully ignorant.  All the other not-Republicans are kinda up to speed on the name calling. Democrats need to be a broken record but when their message is shit... people just turn the volume down and stop listening. Sooner a leader is picked the sooner they can change the message and get everyone on the same page.

"Examples in Nazi Germany vs MAGA.      1) Cult of Leadership and Authoritarianism.      Hitler’s Approach: Adolf Hitler cultivated a near-messianic image, demanding absolute loyalty from the German populace and party members; he presented himself as Germany’s only savior.       Trump: Donald Trump’s mass rallies, strongman rhetoric, and insistence on personal loyalty mirror authoritarian leadership styles; he portrays himself as uniquely capable of solving the nation’s problems.

It's not hyperbolic. It took Hitler a year to completely weaponize the German government. Trump has only been at it for 3 months. But if you study the German government a few months after Hitler took over you can see that Trump is making very good progress toward exactly the same goal.   Also there are different forms of fascism. Fascism was actually invented by the Italians under Mussolini. But Il Duce's Fascism was not exactly the same as Der Führer's.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-26T17:38:35,14

"6) Media Control and Propaganda  Hitler’s Approach: Instituted the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (led by Joseph Goebbels) to maintain a uniform pro-Nazi narrative across all media.

Hitler’s Approach: Used the Reichstag Fire as a pretext to suspend civil liberties; arrested opposition leaders (frequently labeled as communists) and outlawed alternative parties.

Johnson.  >“I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, ‘No, I already voted for these people,’” he said. “Then, we have to explain to people, ‘Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now you’ve got to go again.’”  >“And you’ll probably have to go in December and do it one more time,” he added.  >A post-election analysis of Ossoff’s field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoff’s “paid relational” organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.  >The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become “community mobilizers” — a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.  >“We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off,” Ossoff continued.  >Ossoff’s efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.",tech57,2025-04-26T17:00:21,5
