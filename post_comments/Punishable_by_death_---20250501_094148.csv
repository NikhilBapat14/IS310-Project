"It wasn't his only departure, when he bailed out the banks it would've costed him zero extra money to save everyone's houses since bailing the banks out involved paying off the money for those houses to begin with but he decided not to. He also was massively pro war just as much as Republicans. People like to think he was some great president and if wasn't for those darnes Republicans he would've been super progressive and fixed everything but I just don't see it. From where I'm sitting he was never the guy he campaigned as and ironically Biden who was viewed as super centrist wound up being the most progressive president of my lifetime and helped the average person more than I think Obama ever would've  Edit: I didn't think I had to say this but his healthcare plan was a handout to the insurance company when we needed single payer government healthcare",Double-Seaweed7760,2025-05-01T22:39:37,1
