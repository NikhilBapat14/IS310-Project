"This is a huge ruling from a conservative judge. It's a significant step forward.  > U.S. District Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs and others who argued it would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution to carry out recent decisions by state appeals courts that directed the removal of potentially thousands of voter ballots deemed ineligible. Myers wrote that votes couldn’t be removed six months after Election Day without damaging due process and equal protection rights of the affected residents. >  > Myers also ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results that after two recounts showed Riggs the winner — by just 734 votes — over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. But the judge delayed his decision for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. >  >The board “must not proceed with implementation of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court’s orders, and instead must certify the results of the election for (the seat) based on the tally at the completion of the canvassing period,” wrote Myers, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.",progress18,2025-05-05T20:01:01,62

"Meh. That's nice, but of course he will appeal. There's no end in sight to this because Griffin just keeps getting handed opportunities for appeal after appeal after appeal. At some point a judge just needs to say ""That's it, this is final, no more appeals.""  He'll appeal. He'll lose that appeal but will be able to appeal that. I live in NC so I've been following this story and it's beyond ridiculous at this point. NC literally just passed a law last week that stripped control of the election board from the governor (a Democrat) to republicans.

"Well, they have essentially been appealing this election for what seems like forever now.  They even went as far as to say that 1,000s of votes were potentially 'illegal', which included votes cast by both of her parants --her father used his Military ID, which according to the NC GOP  is / was not good enough to prove homeboy is not an illegal alien.",crucial_geek,2025-05-06T08:52:35,10
