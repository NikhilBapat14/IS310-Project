Don't they want some of these trans super-atheletes who are supposedly ruining high school sports to join the military?,30mil,2025-04-24T18:19:47,10
"Republicans are banning trans people from sports, banning trans people from the military, banning trans people from bathrooms, banning trans people from life in general.     And yet, we have to argue over whether this blatant pogrom against trans people counts as a ""genocide"".     This is ridiculous. Trans people have served honorably in our military for years, and Christian nationalist hate mongers just hate the idea that people can be happy without their religious fiats. I'm sick of these Christian nationalists, for real.",southpawFA,2025-04-24T17:22:14,18
"You can tell the right’s attack on trans people is in bad faith because it only came into full swing when they lost on gay marriage - they turned to find another, less popular demographic to assault.",MinimumBigman,2025-04-24T17:50:25,11
Wait. So would this finally exempt women assigned male at birth from being drafted?,hendrixski,2025-04-24T20:09:33,3

Maybe they can start their own military. ,Mekdinosaur,2025-04-25T00:45:27,-2
Google what happens if us transitioned trans people go off medicine. Our body’s fail. This is genocide. But no one’s going to stand up with us until another larger group is attacked too .. but probably not idk thanks America I’m a person too.. oh wait most of you don’t think so.,Special-Rough-3946,2025-04-24T17:48:54,10
We will eventually win this too. We just have to get through some baddies first.,ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-24T18:13:05,8
"Marginalized groups often go to the military, since it's a generally reliable way to get into the middle class. The military also intentionally targets at risk kids since... Well they're more likely to enlist.    A lot of trans teens find themselves without any family support structure, and the military ends up competing with being a homeless sex worker. I'm not gonna judge anyone who chooses either option, tbh.",Fabint,2025-04-24T18:45:28,7
