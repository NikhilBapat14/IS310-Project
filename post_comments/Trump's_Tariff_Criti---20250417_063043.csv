"There is a right way to do tariffs and a wrong way to employ them to protect America's strategic national interests and security.  Opinion pieces like this are written by political keyboard warriors, not by those of us that are in the trenches of industry.  Globalism as a word and concept has been bastardized.  Globalism has allowed the U.S. to have the highest standard of living in the world, that's an indisputable fact.    Politics and industry have always been inextricably intertwined.  Free trade has always been a conservative precept.  Industries typically don't get hollowed so much simply by labor arbitrage but by political meddling.  Unions have gotten their tentacles into many industries and unionism by nature imposes inefficiency and mediocrity.  Most Toyota factories in the U.S. are non-union, guess who makes a higher quality and reliable product?  My company manufactures sophisticated industrial process equipment.  We are entirely U.S. based, our competitors are not.  We are proudly non-union in a deeply red district in a red state.  50% of our revenue comes from foreign buyers, including the Chinese since our products are superior to similar product that are made there.  The tariff war has caused us to institute a hiring freeze and pause expansion plans.  Orders have been paused and some cancelled from some of our foreign buyers.  We are a couple of months out from starting layoffs.  Our input costs are rising and while we'll eat the margin squeeze in the short term, that can't go on indefinitely without us raising prices.  In answer to the authors query, there are innumerable conservative voices that have and will present a better plan than Trump’s to defend America’s interests.  He's actually started to listen to some and distance himself from ""dumber than a sack of bricks"" Peter Navarro.  Trump himself, to his credit, has now mentioned many times that he is flexible, good.  You'd be hard pressed to find any conservative people in industry or even an unaffiliated economist that endorses a chaotic trade war.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-17T07:52:36,72
"Trump's haters ***won't oppose globalism.*** Quite the opposite, they get angry whenever we shoo the rest of the world out of our pantry and they get happy whenever someone throws up a roadblock to slow this process down.  They openly and passionately hate America now, to the point of being saddened by America's recovery.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-17T15:03:47,3
This is really the crux of the problem. There really isn’t a better solution to ward off the looming economic disaster coming to the US with increasing speed.,deadzip10,2025-04-17T12:47:57,2

It is always typical of the left to complain and show problems and fault but they never have a better idea or even any realistic ideas except maintain status quo.  I have yet to see any Democrats proffer a solid plan instead of tariffs at this point except don't do it.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-17T09:42:23,3
">Opinion pieces like this are written by political keyboard warriors, not by those of us that are in the trenches of industry.  It's *The Reddit Effect* \- people who read headlines **and consider themselves informed for doing so** get caught up in the media buzz storm and then they pretend the rest of the world is clueless for not following the same buzz.  These were the people who jumped up and down screaming 'unextinction' ***because a magazine cover said so*** then acted like the original company conned them when it was the original company clarifying they just modified a dog instead of resurrecting the dire wolf. Glance around the rest of this website, you'll find shambling zombie hordes who pretend it was the original company that broke their hearts when it was the media buzz they latched onto in the first place.

"I think we need to be more nuanced when we talk about globalism.   There are economic, industrial, social, and cultural factors at play.   We cant seal off our borders completely from any and all trade; we would be stuck with only our own natural resources and limited quantites of essential goods. Likewise, trading with countries with whom we share similar norms, customs, legal traditions, alliances, etc is generally good. Despite some recent political charades, Canada, UK, France, Japan, S Korea, Australia, Israel, etc are all good and decent countries with whom we have much in common with. Further, we can't readily grow our own coffee beans; we rely on countries like Columbia and Guatamala to trade those to us in exchange for money. There are no (to my knowledge) homegrown coffee bean manufacturers/growers being put out by a cheaper/inferior product from central/South America. Thats just a geographic and ecological fact.   Then there are countries to whom weve offshored production to, often for cheaper labor. I can see either side of this argument. Its wrong for the government to preclude foreign producers as a form of economic protectionism, especially when those regulations often have unintended consequences like subsidizing poor practices or bad business decisions. I believe that happened with Intel the past few decades. On the other hand, in some cases we subverted the well being of American citizens in manufacturing to placate the desires of other American business interests so they could cut costs. This is a hard sell, since applying tarriffs/trade restrictions amounts to a form of central planning; the govt would need to know exactly what products and goods to regulate/restrict to save American jobs. That runs into Hayek's Knowledge Problem in some sense. How exactly do you calculate what/how/when to regulate to save American mfg jobs?   There is one other clear cut trade restriction I am in favor of: bad actors. We shouldnt trade with countries like North Korea that uses slave labor (assuming they could even make stuff), or openly hostile terrorist sponsors like Iran. China is the tricky one; they play by the international rules to the extent it benefits them in their long journey, they dont have some enduring devotion to the liberal democratic order but rather want to see Mao's revolution reach its endstate. We need to be careful there.   Outside of trade and economics, there are the cultural and social factors of globalism which I have grown increasingly skeptical of. In the effort to make more ""open"" societies, we've essentially torn down all of our civic and cultural institutions to meet some romantic ideal of one-worldliness. Its like John Lennon's ""Imagine""...theres no more countries, gender, religion, or tradition. A nice sounding song but the reality is utterly distopian. Weve embraced multiculturalism at the expense of our own citizens and the very institutions that got us where we are. Western countries are forced to accept ""globalism"" in the unrestrained migration of people and broad embrace of multiculturalism while we must still respect the sovereignty and dignity of every other nation and culture but our own.    Its one thing to accept increased trade, engage in diplomatic relations, and permit traval and tourism with friendly nations. Its an entirely different thing to expect every nook and cranny of western civilization to give up their sovereignty for some abstract ideal that ends up turning them into the Atlanta airport. I think a lot of westerners are starting to say ""No thanks.""",milton1775,2025-04-17T10:24:32,6
"Subaru but at the same time, yeah, Subaru, Toyota and others build in non-union right to work states.  It is interesting when you get a bunch of union workers who move to TN back in the 90's and then when it comes to voting in unions... these same union workers REJECT the unions.  What would you suggest to do about the fact that we made trade deals and then foreign countries basically ignore it in favor of tariffs of their own while we follow the agreements made. NAFTA was a joke, there was a vast sucking sound going from the US to China and other countries for our factories. AND they never honored the FREE aspect of the treaty.  Additionally, the regulations and laws in our country for safety and workers being treated well are the other things that the companies escaped when they moved overseas. You know if you were in China, you would have much less safety and other regulatory problems than here. How can people complain about slave labor working for someone here in the US and then buy products made by slave labor overseas. People don't care as long as it is out of sight, out of mind.  It seems also to me, in my opinion, that most people don't care about the slave labor, the child labor and the extremely unsafe conditions that prevail in many other countries, most especially China. Additionally 10 years ago, we ceded the top manufacturing country to China due to all this.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-17T09:52:05,4

"To give you a satisfyingly fulsome answer would require a wall of text.  The TL;DR of it is that a blend of strategic tariffs and incentives can fix trade imbalances.  They can simultaneously achieve MAGA goals and keep the economy humming.    NAFTA had issues, Trump tore it up and replaced it with the USMCA in his first term.  Let's be honest, his beef with Canada wasn't so much economic, it was political, he wanted to destroy Trudeau and his woke regime.

"That's the primary reason we never set up manufacturing in Asia.  Our core IP is our proprietary manufacturing methods, quality control and the software to control our equipment.  The reason the Chinese buy from us is that even though they can build or buy cheaper similar equipment, we just have a significantly superior product.

"Part of fixing the problem is the onerous regulations. While I have no problem with safety regulations, I have seen many times where friends who own businesses and myself have run afoul of some stupid ordinance or regulation. A friend who did custom car resto in MI after a heavy rainfall, an inspector came along and said he had to actually lower his windows because the distance from the ground to the window was too high. Problem was, the rain swept away about 2-3 inches of top soil. The inspector would not accept him building back the lost topsoil and set up a fine of a 500 a day until he complied. He went to court and after 3 years finally had it reversed, the fines were on hold until the case resolved. If he had lost they would have totaled up the fines and he would have been out of business. Then again he would have been out of business having to replace the windows and lower them in the structure. This is a combination of a stupid regulation that had no safety aspect or business aspect. And there are 1000 of stupid onerous regulations.  The trade imbalance is because other countries DON'T follow the agreements they made, especially China. The only way to push those countries to be fair and pull down their tariffs is to show we can do without and hike ours till the come to the bargaining table.   Then you have their slave labor that no one does anything but give lip service to. Literally pennies on the dollar as far as labor is concerned. Even equal tariffs wont stop that.   Feel free to post a wall of text. Just make sure you use paragraphs  so it isn't a true wall. I can easily research anything I don't understand and follow along. I mean if you can post a solid statement that explains exactly what you mean.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-17T17:00:01,1
">That's the primary reason we never set up manufacturing in Asia.   That's the problem Trump is trying to address.  You *should* be able to set up in *any* country without danger to your intellectual property being stolen, and *without* Tariffs.  An example is India.  They still have weak intellectual property laws but more importantly they still have high tariffs on America, why?  Why can't your company expand to India (for example) and not have tariffs on *your products?*  A lot of third world countries and even 2nd world countries like India have the same economic protection model.  >[Wikipedia]Prior to the 1991 economic liberalisation, India was a closed economy due to the **average tariffs exceeding 200 percent** and the extensive quantitative restrictions on imports.
