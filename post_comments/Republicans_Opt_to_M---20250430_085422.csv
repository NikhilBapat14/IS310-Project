"One of the more pernicious parts of the proposed bill is trying to force universities to pay half of any unpaid loan amount. The goal here is to use economics to steer universities away from coursework that employers don't care about. Therefore it gives employers more control over what universities teach. I hope you can see the issue here. I'm sure most people are aware of the idea that those who want to control you fear education. It's not technical education that really strikes fear into authoritarians. It's usually cultural education. Education on history. Education on different ideas, lifestyles, and viewpoints in the world. These are things that will be most hurt by an employer driven education system.",kittenTakeover,2025-04-30T12:15:20,9

"If you're poor, I don't have any advice for you. It has always been tough to be poor, always will.  If you're middle income, and don't have too many siblings, your parents likely have enough money to send you to university overseas. Europe, Africa, and Asia all have many countries with cheapo tuition and a cost of living that isn't too high.  Going overseas to a cheaper country for uni and grad school is a better idea than paying for in state public uni in most states. If you live in a state with more expensive in-state prices public university, strongly consider going overseas.  If you're a parent of a small child, enroll them in foreign language classes now.  Another good aspect of overseas education is that it can be a launching pad to permanent emigration. My uncle went to med school in the UK and lives there permanently. UK and Ireland are no longer cheap for international students, but there are plenty of countries in continental Europe which still are.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-30T11:39:24,11

"The fact that is ignored in pretty much every discussion about the cost of college is that we’ve never concluded just how much college education we should fund. Should it be all who choose to enroll, as we allow it now? That has proven ridiculously expensive. Why can’t some top notch university, in conjunction with a business group like the US Chamber of Commerce, commission the definitive study of the educational needs of the nation? Mike Bloomberg tried to do something along these lines to improve high school course but was stopped by liberal illogic. If ~30% of jobs truly and definitely require the knowledge and skills that can only be attained through college courses - we’re talking STEM, medicine, law, accounting,even social work, etc - then why are we allowing more than 30% of any high school graduating class to enter college. Within this study we could apportion seats according to projected need. If corporations need 100,000 graduating business majors next month and we’ve allowed 150,000 to enroll in those degree programs, then we are driving down wages in that career while wasting the expense of some 50,000 degrees. It may even prove true that a substantial portion of jobs - say virtually every big box store - can be satisfactorily performed with a high school diploma.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-30T09:31:53,-12
"I went to college in the late 1980’s and did a year abroad in England. I was on pretty much a full scholarship at an elite school, based on my public high school performance. The school capped our loans at $10K for the whole degree, which would be like $30K now. In England, I saw how much social class mobility we had in the US, perhaps especially for kids like me who could access higher education. My spouse and I aren’t rich, but we got to do jobs we love and find meaningful and are for the benefit of society.  We saved and invested what our parents were able to squirrel away through hard work, and have been able to send our children to college without accruing debt. It has broken my heart to see the opportunities we had erode away, and now they are being wiped out in an intentionally-created economic and cultural tsunami.

">It's the same system we fought a Revolution to overturn, but instead of a king, we get a senile, sociopathic imbecile as tyrant.  Who was given the best education money could buy and *still* displays an abysmal lack of intelligence.  Almost all of the people at the top have received fantastic educational opportunities, but have proven that they're not actually *intelligent*.  That's telling, it indicates that this isn't even about education, it's a status symbol for them.  They want to restrict who can attend university simply so they can dangle it in front of others and bolster an inflated sense of importance to compensate for their lower intellectual capabilities.  ""I have a piece of paper that says I'm smart, so you have to do what I tell you.""  The problem with this is, education isn't locked behind wealth or power any more, and we, as a society, have become too educated to be kept in stasis, or shoved back into a dark age of pseudo-intellectual superiority ""guiding"" us.  A degree lends legitimacy to a claim of superiority, but without the intellect to support it... well, look at where we are today.  They are, of course, trying to restrict education, trying to shut down Wikipedia, trying to end public education through services like PBS, but even if they succeeded with that, libraries still exist, and the Internet is too open and broad to stifle intellectual growth in those who seek it.  Too many of us are educated, and determined not to deprive subsequent generations of that same right, of that opportunity to expand not only their own world, but to contribute to the world at large.  They've already lost this fight.  No matter how hard they try, they can't drag us down to their level.  But what would I know?  I don't have a degree.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-30T16:49:38,8

"In truth, while we’ve become accustomed to veterans educational benefits, the conditions they were founded on after WWII no longer exist. At that time, fully 10% of the population had served abroad with more stationed in the US. Daily life was affected from rationing and blackout drills to soldiers patrolling bridges and railway stations. Items were in short supply and wage controls enacted. The memory of the Bonus Army and a post WWI recession were still fresh in politicians minds. The economy had been disrupted and the world suddenly had a new order. Today, only about 1.1 million serve with 5 million more veterans. Of that number but 10% serve in hostile environments and fewer still face the risks “outside the wire.” There needs to be some sort of qualification to EARN the GI Bill such as two enlistments without any bonus money and at least two Campaign Ribbons. And the degree program has to be a field with solid ROI in that expense. The initial costs of advertising, recruiting, testing, screening, transporting, training, feeding, clothing and housing someone who enlists will never be recovered. Spending more confiscated tax dollars to retrain someone should be the exception. And I include myself in that category.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-30T11:53:43,3
