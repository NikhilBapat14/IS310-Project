"One factor is that young people tend to not vote. ""It's going to be different this time. This generation coming up is more active politically than any generation before them!"" is a common narrative every cycle, but the fact of the matter is that doesn't really happen. Obama was probably the only modern exception that I can think of. Old people vote at really high numbers (relatively). So the online Gen Z political discourse can skew 99% Democrat, but if they are all in a solidly blue or red state or don't end up actually voting, it doesn't matter. The election comes down to only 7 or so states. If Gen Z were to vote in numbers like the Gen X to Boomer aged people, it'd be a landslide, but when pollsters crunch their numbers they adjust for how likely someone is to vote and Gen Z just isn't statistically likely to vote at a high percentage in states where it matters.",natelion445,2024-08-06T13:10:04,195
"It isn’t about who is voting, it’s about where people are voting. In swing states like PA, GA and others, the polls are genuinely too close to call.   It doesn’t help that these states are a mix of metropolitan cities and rural areas. While you may think Gen Z is mostly liberal, that’s not the case in rural areas where there is a lot of Gen Z who like Trump. (Why they like him is a whole different discussion.)  Those states will be the ones to determine the election.",WhateverJoel,2024-08-06T13:56:04,63
"It won't be remotely close in terms of the popular vote. Kamala Harris will get millions more votes.  It will be very close in terms of the electoral college, because small states get dramatically more votes relative to their population, and that tilts the balance in favor of Republicans (who do better in rural areas).  However, there's a broader issue, which is that U.S. elections are winner-take-all, unlike most European countries which have a parliamentary system. That naturally tends to a two-party system, and over time the parties tend to adapt to balance each other.  Historically, when a party shrinks, it tends to ""expand its tent"" to appeal to more voters. The Republican party only pulled in evangelical Christians in the 1970s, for example. It tends to make elections close.",dmazzoni,2024-08-06T14:23:12,49
"Every election feels like this and it has always confused me. I used to wonder if polling was manipulated on purpose to keep people engaged in the news cycle, and Im still not entirely convinced that isnt the case.   Then you watch the elections live and you kind of see that the sheer number of people voting is what keeps polling so close. 6 million votes can be the difference between 3 or 4 points.   But that still doesn't seem to explain a random polling of 1,000 people for 2 candidates with an outcome of say 49 vs 51 percentage points . I guess I just dont understand statistics.",soulself,2024-08-06T13:23:28,29
"The problem here is that elections, by definition, are quite unpredictable. That's why we have elections. There is no really good way to approximate the things we learn from elections without actual electoral results. Polls, debates, issue tracking, fundraisers, rallies, protests, etc all of these things are just parts of ways to learn some of the stuff that elections tell us. We still default to elections as the definitive voice of the people in part because they are hard to simulate or replace with anything else.  So how do we actually predict elections? Well, in the modern era, we largely approach it from two different angles: punditry, and science. Pundits are not very predictive. They make all sorts of predictions that often do not come true. They hope that they make enough predictions that folks only remember the ones that happened to come true and forget all the ones that didn't. That's obviously a poor way to predict an election. The other option is to use science by focusing on what has been the best at predicting past elections. We're a bit better at this.  But when I say a bit better, I mean it. Going back to the beginning point, nothing is really completely predictive of elections, especially this far out. Polls are often the *most* predictive, but in July? They've got *tons* of error. Yet we largely rely on polls more heavily than anything else because of all the things that have any predictive value, polls have the most, even in July. Which, again, isn't all the reliable.  And right now? The polls say it's a total toss up. That's really the long and short of the answer. We think the election will be close because the polls are close. Are there other factors? Absolutely, again, *polls are not predictive and this far out from an election are often full of error*. But there is absolutely no possible way to look into the future and predict it with any degree of confidence using all those other factors. We just do not know which ones are going to be relevant.  Personally, I don't think this election will be close. I think the polls are either suffering from error or will shift dramatically. I think there's a lot of reasons why the Reps will strongly underperform and the Dems will overperform. But do I have actual facts and evidence to back that up? Nope, no one does. We only have narrative analysis to suggest why we might be right, and it could be that we look back and see certain analyses vindicated. But we cannot predict the future, so we default to the what we know: polls, which the most predictive thing we have, are close, and therefore, the election should be close.",mormagils,2024-08-06T14:38:45,10
"I think polls are useless today because so few people answer their phones except maybe older folks (I’m over 65, a Democrat in NC and I block most of my calls). It’s really forecasting, which, like the weather, is totally unpredictable!   Pollsters want to keep their jobs, the media wants to sell clicks. So supposedly someone is answering these polls…I think the election will be close-but I don’t believe the polls-they were wrong the last three elections 🤣",rswoodr,2024-08-06T18:57:54,3
"Because as awful as Trump is, the last four years of Democratic governance are viewed as a failure by a decent amount of people. And also because we’re so polarized that even Hitler or Jesus could be guaranteed probably 40% support and 40% hate",JasonPlattMusic34,2024-08-06T15:31:13,5
"A fundamental misunderstanding about how people vote is that the people who actually vote are targeted by massive PR campaigns that work. Afornedample Biden has, objectively, been an extremely successful president and the economy is booming by many standard metrics (the very metrics trump bragged about over and over). Consumer spending has reflected this since COVID.   Nevertheless Americans are svery glum about the economy and report ""struggling"" even though wages have outpaced inflation since COVID.  The main reason for this economic malaise is that there's been an absolutely insane OR campaign by Republicans about how this economy is actually the ""worst ever"" because they can point to inflation and gas prices and pretend like it's Biden's fault- completely ignoring that this is a global phenomenon driven by macro-economoc factors and that much of this inflation is consumer driven because of the post COVID soending boom. Really basic economics and obvious stuff, but the PR campaign has been so intense that almost ALL Republicans now repeat what they have been told to think in unison, and republican pessimism is SO out of wack with economic reality that it's affecting how independenta and even liberals view our current economy.  Couple this with the fact that Republicans have successfully branded themselves as the edgy, counter-cultural alternative to the do-gooder politically correct Democrats and suddenly you find much of the population being completely blinded to what an obvious choice this election should be and acting like this is a tough choice.",RupFox,2024-08-07T03:18:48,2
"It is the electoral college. The Democratic Party could lead the popular vote by millions of people but 3 small swing states could overturn that and it has happened, see 2016. Trump also wanted that to happen in 2020, which is why he threatened governors and secretary of states of swing states.   It gets better, the electors the voters pick do not even need to vote for the ticket they were voted by the people to support. The state doesn't even necessarily need to send in a panel of electors selected by the voters (not fully tested in law but Trump tried it but Pence refused, this is why Republicans wanted to hang him).",seanosul,2024-08-06T14:32:54,5

"Theres a pretty great arguement for the right as well.  -As stated, younger people are less likely to vote and trumpers are really passionate people. Im not siding with anyone here. Im just saying, those people showed up in jan 6th, there are definitely going to vote. Not to mention all the people who swayed from left to right after his attepted assassination, mostly likely with some sort of 'damn, if someone is trying to kill him, he must be doing something right' type of rhetoric.

"A lot of the other answers mostly caught the points I wanted to make, but I can add a few factors to the calculus.  (1) The 70-year ""Vacation from History"" is decidedly over around the world. In the USA, the 30-year drive toward isolationism (interrupted by 9/11 and Afghanistan) is now moving ahead at full speed, pushed by both extremes, MAGA and Progressives. This is happening as Russia and China are rushing to fill the vacuum of our withdrawal. Biden slowed it and woke many centrists to the dangers of anti-global instincts, but Trump, Vance, Kamala and Walz are all anti-globalist populists with ZERO foreign policy experience. That is a problem for centrist Republicans and Democrats.  (2) Forget the Polls. There is no statistical model for what is happening in the world over the next 5- to 10-years. The polls are based on historical data, but both the Republican Party (probably with this election) and Democratic Party (by next election, or the one after) are collapsing into camps. The Democrats are held together only by their opposition to anything and anyone perceived as contaminated by the Right or Republicans and Republicans lost Religion, Law & Order, The Constitution, Foreign Policy, etc. in 9 short years. Labor, RINOs, Globalist Democrats, Police Unions, Wall Street Businesses, and Main Street Businesses are all homeless right now. Tech businesses and Media (including Liberal Media) know that their days are numbered with Democrats and that the days of 24/7 cable news is over.  (3) You mentioned Demographics and have probably heard of Peter Zeihan if you want a broad overview of demographics, but frankly the winner is going to be the side that can get their heads out of their ideologies and break through the information silos to talk directly to the homeless factions of both parties. There is no poll for that.",ApprehensiveCopy9578,2024-08-07T08:32:10,1
"One sentiment that I'm seeing echoed on social media with Gen Z is what I've heard described as a ""purist"" mindset. Many of them won't vote for Harris because she's in bed with the military-indistrial complex.  In a perfect world, I wouldn't vote for her either, but there's simply too much at stake for this election to let Drumpf win by default. Drumpf winning again is itself a terrifying prospect, but now Project 2025 will be implemented if he's elected. Even political experts are shaking in their boots about the very real possibility that P'25 could be strategically implemented.  It sounds like the Heritage Foundation wants to make the US a dystopian society for anyone who is not a straight, cis, white, Christian male. Their worldview is truly awful. They cannot get the power they need to turn their vision into a reality.",Loonkin,2024-08-07T14:44:40,1
"I agree that the way things are, our election results are way too close.

Every time I see these posts it's hilarious because no one ever posts serious answers for why people actually vote for Republicans.

Elections are always going to be close landslide Victories are a rarity.  That involve the candidates being bigger than life.

"My opinion (this is based only on my own opinions and observations) is that it's heavily due to misinformation. Many Republican voters exist in an ecosystem where the news they receive is heavily skewed. Many Republicans don't even know what happened on January 6th. I, like you, think it's a clear choice, VP Harris is the only true leader on the ballot. But others don't even know the very basic facts.  Also, former President Trump is good about tapping into people's hatred and fear. He's made it so many of his voters consider supporting him part of their identity. It's really hard admit you supported the wrong candidate when you make that support a big part of your identity (as opposed to those of us who just try to make the best choice and use trustworthy media to see whether we should change our mind in the next election).  ETA: I also heard that many of the Gen Z this time around are too young to remember some of the awful stuff former President Trump did-- the wall, banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, calling white supremacists ""very fine people,"" etc. As lots of these folks get their news from social media, not CNN/NBC, it's harder for them to know about what actually happened in 2017-2021.

"Let me start by saying, this isn’t normal. Not by a long shot. When the polls are this close, it’s a sign that something else is brewing beneath the surface. If people were truly making their decisions independently, a dead-even split like 50/50 would be statistically near-impossible. What’s even more unsettling is how these numbers stay stagnant, not moved by any major changes or event (and we had a lot). It’s not natural.  What’s clear to me now is that we’re trapped in a feedback loop. A significant chunk of the population isn’t thinking for themselves; they’re reacting to the polls. I call it the ""buffer effect""—borrowing from chemistry, where adding acid to a buffer solution doesn’t immediately change the pH because of a salt reservoir. This reservoir absorbs and neutralizes the acid, keeping the pH steady—until it can’t anymore. Right now, that buffer effect is in play with voters.  Undecided voters? Listen to the interviews with them after the debate, many of them are, in reality, Trump supporters or former ones. They’re hesitant, perhaps even embarrassed to admit it, but they’ll only claim to vote for him if they see him starting to lose. They don't want to align with him openly but don't see Kamala Harris or the current administration as a good choice, as they crave for some change. This hidden vote is massive for the effect to be this big and the polls to be so stable.  What scares me most is that the reservoir might be more willimgbto vote than we realize, with people choosing chaos just for the sake of change, unable to admit their true leanings out loud. It’s not a vote for Trump—it’s an indictment of Biden and Kamala. But in the end, the result is the same.  I really hope I’m wrong about this. But if I’m not, don’t flaunt your vote. It could only feed this feedback effect, and if this buffer is just invisible in the polls it may be too late already.",Have_a_good_day_42,2024-10-24T00:26:59,1

"Polls might not be as accurate as many may think. Pollsters actually have to make a bunch of assumptions when determining the results of a poll (as is common with most statistical modeling). These assumptions have changed between elections in order to try and make polls more accurate.   Looking at the current polling situation, so many polls are showing tiny margins that it actually defies statistical theory. In the event of a completely tied race, due to sample variability, there should still be more variation in polling results than we are actually seeing. I think that about 60% of swing state polls show a margin of 1% or less, which is extremely unlikely.   I’m not skilled enough in statistics to give you a detailed explanation of why, but it might involve pollsters making assumptions that favor results showing a close contest because they believe (a priori) that it is a tied race. Also polls that show a greater margin favoring one of the candidates may not be published due to the pollsters worrying about their reputation or discarding the results as erroneous.   Take home message: polls are not an exact science and they are subject to errors and biases. Maybe it really is a tie, but more likely we will see the actual results diverge from most polls by quite bit. This will of course give the losing side plenty of ammunition if they decide to cry foul.",Cute-Ingenuity3996,2024-11-01T05:52:57,1

"imo its the GOP constantly updating districts to favor them in a vote. And also a lot of young people just feel pretty hopeless after a few years due to the cost of living and negetive press so they figure why bother its the lesser of two evils, its not even representative it goes through electors. Either way we are stuck with a declining country. All of congress are retirement age people and that generation has done nothing but gatekeep us from opportunity. All they care about is their damn pensions and property values. For example they'll talk about wanting to support the lower/middle class, but shoot down every building permit for affordable housing in their area because my property value would go down. SO why would i trust those boomers to make decisions that benefit me and improve my life. How will they understand the challenges I face nowadays, and how the heck are they going to understand what we need to safeguard against threats in the future.

The gop have lost the popular vote since before I was born but they still win sometimes. Also as people are saying GA, NC, NM, PA,WI, and MI are the only ones that arent a forgone conclusion.

If it were a true representative democracy every vote would count the same and you’d simply ask who has the more votes, rather than holding onto an ancient system that only needed to exist before fast communication and accurate ballot counting",Quinticuh,2024-10-16T12:27:43,1

"If you can, take a statistical method class. Mathematically, if it is a  true random sample of a population, the minimum to get scientifically significant is incredible small, ~400.   When 1,000 respond to the poll, and they are randomly chosen, there is a 95% confidence in the result as accurate of the opinions of 200 million. The fact is, a sampling of the population, that is a true representation of the population, there is strong statistical analysis that it is scientifically accurate.   There is always a danger the sample is bad. There are ways to design a survey to overcome that. And there is always a margin of error.   For example, if you polled 10,000 random adults in the USA, and had the right weighted sample of what the electorate looks like demographically, you would be at like 99% confidence with a 1 or 2% margin of error.   Now, in a 50-50 election, MOE is a thing (Trump was within Margin of error in 16!).   no, polls are not meaningless at all. Polls that are done internally (internals) are incredibly expensive and incredibly accurate. The media polls we see are of good quality, but they aren’t bullet proof. Instead of looking at the top line…. With polls you want to look at what is aggregate of all polls. Then, what is the trend we are seeing in the aggregate.   For example, aggregate polls and trump up 3 pts on Biden. Harris? Now it is Harris up a point. Is that close? Yes. But the story is the trend line.",CTCELTICSFAN,2024-08-07T14:03:44,1

"Not only that, but it also existed to give the southern states an advantage.  Slaves weren't allowed to vote but they were still counted as population for distributing representatives. Southern states wanted them counted as full people for the purposes of congressional representations, Northern states didn't want them counted at all (since they weren't treated like people and weren't allowed to vote - why should anyone pretend they were actually being *represented*), so they settled on the 3/5ths Compromise.   The upshot, though, was that Southern States still gained more representatives than they would have received otherwise. And since states receive a number of electoral votes equal to their total number of representatives and senators, that meant more electoral votes as well and thus more weight in presidential elections.

"Did you know Hillary used campaign money to hire a foreign spy (Steele) to work with the Russians (Drenchenko) to create a mostly unverifiable Dossier. That Dossier was then given to the FBi by a third foreign Clinton supporter, an Australian that gave the dossier to a hostile FBI agent named Peter Strzok. The dossier was then used to start an investigation and obtain a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. The fact there was an investigation was also then leaked to the media who ran with it saying Trump was under investigation for Russian collusion.   A follow up investigation by Mueller where Strzok was removed from the team and subject of his own investigation cost US taxpayers millions of dollars. And it turned out “the investigation could not establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government”   For all this Clinton was also found guilty of improperly using campaign funds and lying about it.  Her penalty….a fine.   But yeah Trump paid for an NDA for a hooker he slept with.   Yep the court seems fair.  Yes The impeachments were definitely politically motivated, his second one happened before there was even an investigation.   Yes the AG of NY ran a campaign vowing to get Trump by any means necessary. Then charged him with grey area accounting crimes that happened a decade or more ago.  They wanted to put him in prison for keeping classified documents. Biden kept classified documents for over a decade and nobody cared, defend him and he received no punishment whatsoever. Yes it appears they are out to get Trump.   You should know Biden also had TS/SCI documents, read documents aloud to a person without clearance and attempted to stop the FBI from looking in his “personal journals” which had TS/SCI documents and hand written copies of such documents.  https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/02/report-from-special-counsel-robert-k-hur-february-2024.pdf",intothewoods76,2024-11-25T10:54:38,1
