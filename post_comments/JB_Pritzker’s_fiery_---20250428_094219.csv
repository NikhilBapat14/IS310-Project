"It's honestly shocking how little faith people have right now, and, like, with Trump's approval rating being the absolute lowest for a new president in 80 years, it just underlines how urgent it is that someone really calls out what's happening. It makes you really wonder, shouldn't we all be outraged by the current state of American politics? I mean, it's just not acceptable anymore...",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-28T09:46:30,198
"Idk anything about JD Pritzker so won't comment on whether or not he's qualified or should be the candidate, but calls to action like this TODAY are what we need to be seeking from anybody who wants a serious shot at being the candidate in 4 years. No more Biden unity, we need to take our country back from these fuckers and make sure they don't come back from the dead again.",68plus1equals,2025-04-28T10:38:50,58
"It's really essential, honestly, that we actively resist this administration, Pritzker's call to action feels like a necessary step, and I agree wholeheartedly because shouldn't we all be outraged by the current state of affairs and actively resist?, it's a question that should keep us all moving forward, but, I do wonder about something regarding the article, it seems to assume everyone will agree with Pritzker's call for mass protests, which feels pretty bold and, you know, maybe a bit blind to the fact that people might have different ideas about how to handle things, or what “resistance” even looks like, and that's something to think about.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T10:08:37,25
"This is why we had protests to begin with.  Not for Booker to speak for 25 hours or Bernie to go on a speaking tour or Biden to say we can’t be divided.  We did it so a leader could join the movement and lead it.  No more words, time for action.  Thanks Pritzker.",dbag3o1,2025-04-28T09:48:07,56
I could not fucking care less about the 2028 presidential election at this point. What I do care about is mainstream Dems standing up to these fascists every moment of every day right here and now.   Pritzker is right that they shouldn't have a moment of peace.  Dems in congress should vote against every single thing the GOP proposes.

People really want to fight a GOP oligarchy with their own billionaire? Nothing against Pritzker in particular but it should be obvious at this point that the ability to have this much money is a problem. We can't rely on the good ones because there aren't enough. Does anyone really think a billionaire is going to be the one that effectively neuters the billionaire class so they can't bribe and buy our government? ,ardent_wolf,2025-04-28T16:29:57,2

We need general strikes across the board and someone (or a group of people) to organize at a national level.   Start with it 1 day long then back to work after. Give us a month to prep and plan and for local business owners to plan. 1 goal: stump removed from office.    Then move it up to 2/3/4 days long every week or two until it happens.,eezyE4free,2025-04-28T17:38:31,1
"Goddamn this is a good line:   “Stop thinking we can reason or negotiate with a madman,” Pritzker told the crowd, adding that Republicans enabling Trump should “feel in their bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American history” their portraits will be relegated “to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors”.",cubeb00b,2025-04-28T22:21:26,1

"It's unfortunate that a billionaire is the one calling for protests. This is what i've been waiting for any democrat to do. Sanders and AoC could use their platform and following to really start a movement, but so far they've been too cowardly. All talk, no action. But Pritzker being a billionaire means he's even worse than Pelosi and the other ultra wealthy dems, so there's no way i'm listening to his call to action. Really shows how sad the democratic party is when the only person willing to step up is a fucking billionaire. ",Bakedads,2025-04-28T09:55:05,-11

"Honestly, I'd say the issue is that people have had very little faith for almost the whole 21st century and no major political entity was willing to acknowledge and channel that--other than maybe Obama 2008 as a brief window. The end result is that people in despair loops desperate for change who didn't know that much about politics threw a Hail Mary with Trump because they saw Clinton/Biden/Harris were all defenders of the status quo.  >It makes you really wonder, shouldn't we all be outraged by the current state of American politics? I mean, it's just not acceptable anymore...  Honestly, I would say the state of American politics hasn't been acceptable at any point in the 21st century. Of course it keeps getting worse and worse as the root issues remain unaddressed and festering. If we get through Trump, I'm genuinely terrified the Dem party won't learn the lesson--they're really good at that--and they'll run yet another status quo establishment pick without a platform in 2028 who'll win off the backlash. If we do that, I'm terrified for what monster will come out of the GOP and likely win in 2032.",Sminahin,2025-04-28T12:48:31,4
"JB says we need to denounce Dump from the soapbox. For those who don’t have a lot of followers, media reach, etc this may seem like meaningless folly, but the other night I had a thought.  Hundreds of millions of angry murmurs can be pretty damn loud, especially to those who are used to indulgent silence.   You CAN protest all day, every day just by not holding your tongue anymore out of fear you may offend a stranger whose politics you don’t know.   Go ahead and say whatcha wanna say, when and where others can hear it. Use snarky nicknames, complain, whatever. If anyone has a problem with it give ‘em the hairy eyeball and keep on keepin’ on. It’s a small thing, but small things add up. Consider it covering fire for those making bigger moves.",evasandor,2025-04-29T08:07:01,1

"People love to throw around the idea of a general strike, but the reality is that most people are too scared of losing their jobs to actually risk it. You don’t just need anger for a general strike.. you need collective fearlessness.. and that’s in short supply when everyone’s worrying about how they're going to put food on the table and keep a roof over their kids heads.  The much better call out, and the thing that has a MUCH BETTER chance of actually succeeding: simple sabotage. The OSS (precursor to the CIA) [published a handbook (Project Gutenberg link)](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/26184/pg26184-images.html) during WW2 with a better alternative that instructs saboteurs on how to ratfuck corporate and government entities.  They knew that mass walkouts were dangerous and easy to crush.. so they taught people how to wreck a system from inside without ever openly revolting. Slow everything down. Follow every rule exactly even when it makes no sense (hell, if you're in a position of authority, *a*dd some of those insane rules). Start endless meetings. Stir up office drama. ""Misunderstand"" instructions. Lose paperwork. Work just a little bit worse every day.  With strikes, it is really obvious who’s participating, and it makes it easy for bad actors (either within your company, or within the government) to retaliate. But mass simple sabotage? If enough people are doing it, it absolutely grinds everything to a halt.. and on an individual level, it’s almost impossible to prove. You can’t fire half the workforce for “being inefficient” without burning down your own company.  It’s not loud, it’s not heroic, but it’s way more effective in a society where most people can’t afford to gamble everything. Death by a thousand paper cuts still kills.",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-28T19:32:55,3

> To anyone that will listen  I think it is more important to raise your voice to the people who will **not** listen.  To the point where they are unable to have a moment of peace or rest.  The mistake that has been made in recent protest movements was yelling at the people that agreed with us who were doing everything that they had the power to do.  Because all that did was undermine the work that they were doing and empowering the people who worked against us.  What we must do is disrupt the peace and serenity of those who are our enemies.  We must inject misery and suffering into the lives of those who seek to visit the same on us.  They must know not a moment of calm while they are in public.  While they are trying to eat there must be people screaming at them.  While they walk down the street people should be getting in their face to tell them that they are monsters.  While they try to enjoy time with their significant others and children there should be people telling their family how terrible they are.,code_archeologist,2025-04-28T10:15:28,42
