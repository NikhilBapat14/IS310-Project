"He's not like us. ""Quiet quitting"" is what workers from the middle class do.   He's strategically withdrawing after having done his part in the onslaught against American democracy.

"He‚Äôs not quite quitting anything, he destroyed our democracy and destroyed any evidence various agencies had on him. He did exactly what he was supposed to do, all he had to do was pay trump for it. It‚Äôs easier to pay 250 million to legally remove evidence, as opposed to losing billions in legal costs.

"I fully fucking loathe this term. Its never been used right even when it was introduced. Quiet quitting is just ‚Äúdoing what you are being paid to do, not more‚Äù, which isnt quitting anything, and isnt really all that quiet either.  He left. Just write that he left the white house.

"This should be the assumption.  We can't trust anything they say, and have to assume the worst.  Even if he does appear to be done and back to Tesla, the boycotting of anything Elon and Tesla should continue.  He needs to be run out of his businesses and run out of America.",thinkards,2025-05-01T13:11:20,22

Wisconsin was pretty embarrassing for him in addition to Tesla tanking. Less like Thanos and more like a wounded Skeletor pouting in his lair. Maybe he has our data but he definitely doesn't have our admiration or respect like he had hoped with DOGE.,Frankenkind,2025-05-01T13:05:21,10
