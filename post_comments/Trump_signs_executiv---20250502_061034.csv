"Authoritarian regimes control media to maintain control, manipulate the public, and send out propaganda.  They do NOT want the truth coming out in any form.  This is just another step in our downward spiral into a dictatorship.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-02T06:22:36,20
"Surprised it took him so long. ""Defund NPR / PBS"" has been on the fundie wish list for decades.",ChloeGranola,2025-05-02T06:33:10,8
"Is this funding approved by Congress? Then Trump can shove his order straight up his ass with the other shit he spews. Congress controls the finances. If it was approved funding, the Executive has ZERO authority to deny it. Checks & Balances. Not that the wannabe Hitler cares about the actual law - that much has already been demonstrated for years.  Yet another order that's going to be fought in the courts at yet more taxpayer expenses. All because someone said something that was blinding praise for the Emperor.",athornton79,2025-05-02T06:33:48,5

"Is NPR smuggling fentanyl from Canada or is it a Venezuelan gang member?  Perhaps he could deport Sesame Street to El Paso.

"‚ÄúWhich viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,‚Äù the order says. ‚ÄúWhat does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.‚Äù  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/02/trump-executive-order-cuts-funding-pbs-npr-00323154?cid=apn",Sir_Earl_Jeffries,2025-05-02T08:25:56,1
"But if NPR goes away, how will I find out about how McDonald's new popular breakfast menu item is impacting the trans community and traditionally marginalized groups?
