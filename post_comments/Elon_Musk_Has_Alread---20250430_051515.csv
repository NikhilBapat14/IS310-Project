"DO NOT BELIEVE IT. He still has his people in place! They are hitting AmeriCorps and Peace Corps hard now.  I served 11 years in national service - Peace Corps and AmeriCorps.  I did disaster relief in Appalachia, built houses for low-income elderly in WV, taught in NYC. Finally I became a director for rural educational programs to help train teachers from rural and reservation communities.  On Friday, myself, my entire program, and more than 40,000 AmeriCorps Members nationwide were fired by DOGE. They took over AmeriCorps HQ and got rid of 85% of the staff.  States are suing. No disaster relief or people to fight wildfires in the summer in places like Wyoming and CO.  DOGE IS STILL WREAKING HAVOC AND HURT WORKING CLASS PEOPLE.",Salty_Conflict_218,2025-04-30T09:46:55,340

"The ‚Äòheinous incel' and his teenage incel team  wrecking ball will have real long-term consequences.  The agencies he and his allies have dismantled ‚Äî USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ‚Äî will be very difficult to put back together, so the US will be doing far less foreign aid and consumer protection for the foreseeable future.  Tens of thousands of other layoffs or buyouts in federal agencies could also have consequences we don‚Äôt fully understand; when you recklessly break things, problems could materialize later.  And much of DOGE‚Äôs work will continue after he leaves. Trump‚Äôs agenda of reducing the federal workforce and strengthening presidential control over the civil service will also keep moving forward, now spurred more by figures like Vought.  And though the Musk allies at the OPM aren‚Äôt unilaterally engineering layoffs anymore, Trump will reportedly give the office the authority to review new agencies‚Äô hiring requests.  There can, however, be lessons in failure. A future president ‚Äî say, JD Vance, who has long backed right-wing activists‚Äô goal of purging the federal workforce, and has close ties to the tech right ‚Äî could learn from what went wrong with DOGE, try a new and improved DOGE 2.0, and actually see it through.  And perhaps, in a year or two, Trump will get bored and bring back a reempowered Musk to start smashing things again  https://www.vox.com/politics/410893/elon-musk-doge-failed-cabinet-spending",No_Clue_7894,2025-04-30T08:31:52,2

"> taking a copy of citizen data along with him  The troubling thing about large data sets like this is that if they are continuously updated, then any particular snapshot becomes stale fast. If Musk sits on it for a year and then tries to start using it, they'll find that much of it is already out of date. Maybe that's okay for their purposes, maybe not, but it certainly won't become *less* stale over time.  > remote access  Honestly, there's no conceivable way that a bunch of 20-year-olds can waltz into an organization as complex as the federal government, with no prior experience or familiarity with any of the infrastructure, and *in the span of 2-3 months* implement an rsync process that consistently and comprehensively captures the data that they would need. I'm absolutely certain that they fucked it up in one way or another and that the data they're exfiltrating will be incomplete, corrupt, encrypted in ways they they can't break, etc.  I presume that DOGE has some moles continuously embedded in the federal government who can fix whatever they fucked up. But with the way that MAGA swamp creatures reliably fall into internecine spats, I feel confident that their astounding incompetence and contagious narcissism will preempt their ambitions.

It was passed after LBJ suggested making a singular database of all federal information and is still law today, but it has no enforcement mechanism.   Angwin goes on to say:  >That makes the United States the only country in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development without a data protection agency to enforce comprehensive privacy laws. In the European Union, each country has a dedicated data protection authority that can conduct investigations, write rules, issue fines and even demand a halt to data processing.

That doesn‚Äôt make sense.   What does make sense is that, under the lie of looking for election fraud, Republican operatives breached election security so they could microtarget elections for covert manipulation.   ‚ÄúRepublican officials and activists in eight U.S. locales have plotted to gain illegal access to balloting systems, undermining the security of elections they claim to protect.‚Äù  https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-breaches/",BalanceOrganic7735,2025-04-30T12:43:11,1
"Only 312 people voted for him, and were counted. The ""popular vote"" (the votes of regular Americans) amount to little more than letters to Santa. They let us vote so that we feel like we're doing something, and then ignore all of them when the actual counting is done. That is the American presidential election; [538 votes](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about).",CalmBeneathCastles,2025-04-30T12:37:44,0

"Democrats deserve plenty of criticism. At the same time - Trump is a GOP president. Senate Republicans could have voted to impeach after Jan 6. They could have loudly disavowed his election lies. They could have distanced themselves from him after his felony convictions. But every time they chose short term political gain.  If there's one thing Democrats love more than blaming Republicans, it's blaming Democrats for not beating Republicans.",remainsane,2025-04-30T19:58:34,0

"Calling for an audit in light of statistical irregularities and implications of vote manipulation doesn't feel like it's unreasonable, denial, or conspiracy theorizing to me.  It's saying *""Hey, this doesn't look right, maybe we should look into it, particularly given how important it is""*.  Without an audit, we simply don't know what happened to cause those irregularities, nor can we say for certain whether Trump/Musk's comments implying vote manipulation have any weight, or were just blather.  Perhaps more importantly, if things *were* manipulated, without an audit we don't have the opportunity to find and close those holes in the system. To be perfectly honest, I think we should be auditing every election, every time, for precisely this reason.  It shouldn't be something ""special"" or out of the ordinary, it should be a matter of course, particularly for national elections.  Unfortunately, the time to do that was back in November. We (as a country) missed our window to do a reasonable audit and clear things up.  Now there will always be questions that can't be answered.",yukeake,2025-04-30T14:02:53,3

I honestly think that there are enough ignorant, racist, ""true believer"", or pro-Trump for other reasons voters that his increase in total vote count could be legitimate. For some reason, US voters have the impression that Republicans are better for the economy than Democrats. Another factor is that in tough times, the party currently in power is penalized.",mrtatertot,2025-04-30T12:04:18,1

If the 8 million or so dems who voted in 2020 but didn't vote in 2024 had showed up, the breaches would either have not been effective or would have been so obvious that we'd have had recounts.

Yeah I always hone in on your last point. Incumbents lost overwhelmingly all over the globe in 2024/2025 elections.

"This question gets down to people's ethics and what they want in government. One exception to your analogy is that there's a ref who penalizes a team for breaking the rules. Most people want that in government - checks and balances - but the GOP across all branches of government has coalesced behind MAGA.  My point is that democrats as a party are split behind governance that the diverse coalition wants and a campaign that the most passionate supporters want. But as we saw in the last campaign, there's a lot of people who won't vote for Democrats because they don't seem to provide a sufficiently different alternative to Trump. Then we get Trump, and he's awful, and finally people show up. But if they'd shown up in the first place, we could've had Hillary, or Kamala, or anyone who's not perfect but better than the GOP.  To use your analogy, it's as if the losing football team had a third of the team sit out because the players didn't like the way the quarterback spoke to them.",remainsane,2025-05-01T18:40:36,0
