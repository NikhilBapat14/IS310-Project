">Census data shows that about 4 million Americans had registration issues in 2020.   What ""Census data""? Looks like a false statement.",QueeLinx,2024-10-11T07:46:05,3
"Did a quick check from the data linked. The Census Bureau Table 10 that you are referencing shows 4.9% had registration issues from a total 12.81 million not voting. That gives you just under 630,000 people. Not sure how you are ending up with 4 million",Omnes-Una-Manet-Nox,2024-10-14T16:45:46,1
"USCB said 5% of people who did not vote had registration issues, which is 4 million people. All data is linked in the article, directly from the Census Bureau.",WritingWesley,2024-10-11T08:01:22,0
"This is the first Iâ€™ve heard that only 12.8 million Americans did not vote. Can you provide that data?  In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, about 158.4 million Americans voted out of an eligible voting population of approximately 240 million. Now, if only 12.8 million people did not vote, the turnout would have been even higher.  So, the voter turnout rate would have been approximately 94.67% if only 12.8 million people had not voted. Voter turnout was around 60%.",WritingWesley,2024-10-14T16:56:38,1
Article does not say that.,QueeLinx,2024-10-11T08:10:55,1
The 12.81 million is from Census Bureau Table 10 where you got the 4.9%. Its not 4.9% of all nonvoters,Omnes-Una-Manet-Nox,2024-10-14T17:03:14,1
