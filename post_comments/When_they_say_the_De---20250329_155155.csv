"Anyone who says ""Democrats are the party of racists"" is not worth interacting with. Pick your battles.   I'm all for winning back 10-15% of white men, blue collar and rural voters....A comment like that shows a particular type of brainwashing that just isn't worth your time to tangle with. For your own sanity and because nothing you will say makes a difference.",TheStarterScreenplay,2025-03-29T16:07:13,112

They like to talk about the racist Southern past of the Democratic Party as a distraction from the racist Southern present of the Republican Party.,ob1dylan,2025-03-29T17:04:33,6

"Remember that was the election where the Republican president, George HW Bush, told good republicans to vote for the democrat.  Remember character?",vgaph,2025-03-29T18:11:25,2
"The most salient point of that 1990 election was that GHWB went out of his way to tell people Duke was bad news and not a person that should be in the GOP and not to vote for him.  Had he not done that, Duke very well might have won.  Contemporaneously, Trump was on Larry King minimizing his racism by telling King that *David Duke is just doing the George Wallace thing*, and that *GHWB might come to regret coming out so strongly against Duke*.  Fast forward a few decades and Duke endorsed Trump, and when questioned about it, in his inimitable fashion he exclaimed that he knows nothing about it, going so far as to say he doesn't know who Duke is.   I think this is one of the important progressions to describe both Trump and the party.  Even in 1990 Trump knew who the base of the GOP was becoming.  He recognized that in the south the GOP was busy adopting disaffected racist Dixiecrats.  He knows who his base is.  He also knows people have short memories and are gullible as fuck so he can lie brazenly and with complete impunity.",ruler_gurl,2025-03-30T10:58:10,2

Don't even play their game. Ask them why they have to dig back to before we were even born to find proof of racism. Racism is determined by what they are doing today. Not what by our answers sisters did before our time.,Aggressive-Coconut0,2025-03-29T17:02:57,1

"That‚Äôs what‚Äôs gotten so tricky though.  In 1990 you‚Äôd be laughed at as a lunatic for saying the Democrats were the racists, and Duke lost. I was there.  Today? DEI is considered ‚Äúdiscrimination,‚Äù and most of MAGA actually does believe that the Democrats are the ‚Äúreal‚Äù racists. Against those poor, historically oppressed white people (lol, barf).

"Want an even bigger shocker.  There exists an interview with Trump from way back when, where Trump brings up the fact that Atwater is a friend of his and he states that Lee tried to recruit him to run for president back in the 90s.

Strom Thurmond‚Äôs career even tracks with the switch.,StringOfLights,2025-03-29T17:05:50,4
It‚Äôs interesting the party switch took much longer than most people think.  For about 50 years between 1960 and 2010 southern states split tickets to elect Republicans nationally and conservative Democrats locally. In 2000 the majority of southern states were still solid D state governments.  It wasn‚Äôt until Obama‚Äôs first midterm the party switch was complete and the whole South elects Republicans down the ticket.,bongophrog,2025-03-29T18:24:23,3
"And as someone mentioned, there was a great switch. The parties swapped ideologies. So, early Republicans were liberal. Anytime someone says ""so and so was a Republican"" or ""Democrats were the ones..."" from far off events, they're commenting on outdated info. Yes, the Democrats of 1880 did X, but it would also he accurate to say ""the conservative party did X.""",kalas_malarious,2025-03-29T21:37:17,1

"I think that was the Governor election where GHWB said that, where Duke was candidate in 1991. Duke first tired to win this, and got name recognition, then challenged the incumbent Republican governor and placed 2nd, behind the Lizard. That's what The democrats ran as, he was corrupt, and his slogan was vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard.  Edwin Edwards would've lost against any normal Republican probably. But at the time, racist weren't welcome in GOP, at least not KKK ones that were openly racist.",KathyJaneway,2025-03-29T21:15:13,1

"Similarly, the Northeast would continue to elect Republicans (usually Governors but not completely averse to Congressmen and Senators) who were of the Rockefeller liberal wing, long after they had been run out of town at the national level by the Goldwaterites and Reaganites, and their states had shifted further towards Democrats. I think Phil Murphy is the last of them now.",Alex72598,2025-03-30T02:09:17,2
