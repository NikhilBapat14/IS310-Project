"Excerpt    If signed into law, the bill would require the Interior Department to lease out Alaska‚Äôs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Cook Inlet and Western Arctic region for oil and gas extraction, which Indigenous and climate groups have opposed for years. It would also require the U.S. Forest Service to sign long-term agreements with timber companies and would direct federal agencies to increase logging in U.S. forests by 25 percent while rescinding protections for old growth trees.   Sounds like a great path forward. Climate change isn't real Yada Yada Yada..",Tricky_Damage5981,2025-05-08T20:31:39,13

Dems should tell the logging companies they won't honor the contract. They'll declare a climate change emergency and back out of it.,Purify5,2025-05-08T21:48:36,5

Not so much a 'burnt-out husk' as a rotting corpse.  They don't call them 'MAGATS' for nothing.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-08T21:23:07,6
I hope you are right - but honestly I don't expect them to allow themselves to be voted out.  I fully expect them to rig the results of future elections.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-08T21:24:29,3
