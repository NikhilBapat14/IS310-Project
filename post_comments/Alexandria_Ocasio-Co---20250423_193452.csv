I'm in AOC's neighboring district and remember going to her victory party after that first election win in the 2018 Democratic primary (defeating a long term incumbent).  No one who was in that room is surprised that the powers-that-be have since spent 7 years trying to villify her and it hasn't worked. *Everyone* from that night knew exactly how dangerous this woman is.,gradientz,2025-04-23T19:39:57,4276

"Yeah nah. Since the day the man announced he was running, all the way back in 2015, I've seen people saying that Reoublicans will abandon Trump any day now. Any day now they'll get sick of his shit, any day now they'll leave him behind. And they never do it.  I don't trust a damn thing said about Republicans other then that they're corrupt, and they'll vote Trump, and Trump backed candidates. So much time and effort Democrats have spent to turn out someone who just can't seem to bring themselves to dump Trump.  I'm sure AOC will be successful, but it's time Democrats started thinking about their base. Make sure they actually come out and vote for you. Stop chasing after these mythical never Trump Republicans, it's been 10 years.

She needs to go to Central and Western NY. Her message resonates there.

Granted, she did see a rise in the 'unfavorable' category too (up from 51 percent to 60) but if she's defining herself to the broad neutral category, that's never a bad thing.  Of course, it might also have something to do with the fact she was literally *just* taken her seat in 2019 and only been in Congress for two months during the last Siena poll, which might account for a wide 43 percent of respondants just having no opinion on her.",KWilt,2025-04-24T06:28:34,1

"It is amazing what a little bit of authenticity and actual life experience can do for someone.

But how dark is it that someone just trying to help people live better lives is so scary? What kind of person would be afraid of that?  Still, she is the newest victim of the legion of stupid storytellers. I remember my parents once telling me that Obama really needed to shut up about constitutional law, as he was a politician and not a lawyer, and so did not know anything about the law.  When I pointed out that he was a lawer, has his Juris Doctrate from Harvard Law, was predident of the Harvard Law review, and taught constitutional law the University of Chicago for over a decade, the response was ""That can't be true."" When I showed them it was, they just pivoted to an entirely different claim, then swung back to complaining about how he did not know anything about constitutional law later.  The stuff they say about AoC is even worse than that, but is way less specific. The progression of their rhetoric over time has gotten less and less tied to reality. They seem to be attacking an entirely different person, who lived an entirely different life, and has an entirely different education. Nothing they have ever mentioned about her has been remotely related to the actual person. The one main example I can remember is them complaining that she was some kind of rich-girl corporate plant who grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth and never had to work a day in her life.

Sanders ran as a progressive in the 2020 democratic primary against Biden. Biden was decidedly a moderate candidate. He won by 10 million votes.

It’s insane that people still believe this. There’s a pretty strong consensus by many that FDR was the greatest president in American history. A genuine progressive leader for his time literally getting elected four times in a row.  I agree you can’t get people to magically appear and vote for you. You’ve got to through your actions show that you’re actually representing and fighting for the interest of everyday people. Democrats have shown time and time again that they will succumb and wimp out on what’s popular and then guess what you get a voting base that isn’t enthusiastic and motivated to go out and vote. Harris was the perfect example of this. Get an actual progressive into leadership who actually exercises power like Republicans that promotes and fights for progressive policies and you will never lose an election just like FDR.,Staplecreate,2025-04-23T23:08:29,45

"It’s important to acknowledge the role of corporate money in politics and how the current “moderate-leaning right” party of Democrats reflects just about as progressive (fiscally) that corporations are willing to go. And that money tethers Democratic Party leadership and who The Party is willing to support in a given election.   There’s increasing empirical support showing that the Democratic voter base is now the one that is more likely to turn out in elections, including midterms. (The r/fivethirtyeight sub has posts and links to data-driven articles on this topic.)  It’s very difficult to point to any specific election as a use case for how an AOC Presidential election could go. Factors like the state of the economy, which party is the incumbent (for the Presidency and separately for Congress), and whether the Democratic Party torpedoed a too-progressive candidate in the midterms are among a few factors to consider. (And the Democratic Party is not going to advertise that they do torpedo those candidates.)  But, there is research that suggests that progressive economic policies or positions, when evaluated divorced from party affiliation or political-leaning labels, are quite popular across the board.   There are reasons why AOC might not be electable, but the progressive positions she takes, particularly on economic issues (and not the spin Fox News puts on them), themselves are probably low on the list. An electorate that bears witness to the Christo–Tech-Bro-fascist state the current administration is attempting to construct (in part by annihilating the economy) may be ripe for seeing the pendulum swing much farther the other way. How many *recent* elections have we had under these increasingly extraordinary conditions that could accurately forecast how a progressive candidate like AOC could fare? Probably zero. And people are seeing mainstream do-nothing Democrats as complicit.",mediocre_bro,2025-04-24T04:08:00,0
">The Dems aren’t “ramming” less progressive candidates down your throat  The DNC is *absolutely* ratfucking everything they can in relation to progressive candidates. They deliberately sideline and undercut everything to do with any candidate willing to say no to corporate money. It happened to Bernie, it happened to AOC, and the rallies those two are having are *in spite of* the DNC. ""But Bernie lost the primary!"" people cry. Yeah, Bernie lost the primary...*because the DNC deliberately manipulated the primary*. The DNC wanted Hilary, not Bernie, and they manipulated the situation and news coverage to downplay him at every turn. Does that mean Bernie would've beaten Trump? Maybe, maybe not...but the only reason Hilary won the primary is because the DNC made it so.  People are extremely susceptible to propaganda and news, and the 2016 primaries are a perfect example of that. When the news is screaming at every turn that 'Hilary is the candidate,' while sometimes failing to include Bernie entirely, it's tough to argue that the primary was fair.  Progressive policies \[that are usually just 'let's do this thing that's already working in Europe\] are wildly popular, up until Fox News starts screaming 'socialism' and 30% of the country starts to froth at the mouth.",GiventoWanderlust,2025-04-24T08:06:03,0

Let's not forget them backing Biden running right up until that Presidential Debate made him look nonviable in 2024, only for that to screw them over because it meant campaigning in a very short time for something you want to try and set up at least 2 years in advance. There's a reason people say Democrats hate Progressives more than they do Republicans, and both abuse the fact that this country has a two-party system so entrenched that they ARE the de-facto only two options.  ***THAT'S*** why people don't turn out. They're tired of settling, they're tired of not mattering, and I'm not talking about Progressives who hold their votes back for X, or Y, or Z, I'm talking about the general populace who don't vote. Yes, you can tell them if they voted for Harris things would be better. However, I hate to say it but I think half those people are Accelerationist-mode because they believe the only way things can change now is if the US falls apart or is forced to change on massive scale BECAUSE it's so blatantly at risk of that. The Democrats don't help them. The Republicans won't help them. So why bother?  I vote because I can and I want to vote for better things, but I really think if America ACTUALLY wants to get rid of this state where it can say half the country doesn't vote and the rest of the world stares on in bafflement? They need to get their voting system together and rework it so it really is people too lazy and not people who've _given up._ The Electoral College, First Past the Post, this stuff needs to be reworked or trashed.

The issues that lost Kamala the presidency:  - immigration - a poorly run campaign  Every single moderate I knew shrugged off the trans ad whenever a Republican brought it up. The issue was that the independents and even some moderate Democrats were genuinely, 100% convinced that we are being flooded by an unsustainable, never ending wave of gang members from Central America. It was like overnight that people went from, ""The immigrant problem isn't that bad,"" to seeing even legal immigrants I work with talking about how we have ""too many"". I don't know what ads or what info they were getting but people were erratic over it.   If the Dems distracted from the immigrant issue by being funnier and more relatable, maybe results would be different. I don't think that's farfetched. The GOP uses humor and edgy speech to distract from issues all the time.   What moderate Dems lost in 2020 due to such ads btw?

The only races in the country that aren't gerrymanders are statewide races like Governor, State A.G., and individual Senate seats (the Senate, as a whole, is essentially a gerrymander also), etc.      The entire point of gerrymandering is to slice and dice the electorate so you can reach a specific desired outcome in the election.

Yeah so that’s my main point enact progressive popular policies that tangibly and materially change people’s lives and they will come out to vote. Doesn’t matter if you run on a progressive agenda or not. But I will say I can’t imagine it’d be detrimental in the context of today’s environment to run on a bold progressive agenda.   Missouri legit passed a $15 min wage and abortion protections last election. Missouri of all states. How people can still claim that these policies aren’t popular to most people in the country is nonsense.,Staplecreate,2025-04-24T00:14:13,9
People need to understand being the “most progressive” in this context is a relative term. As in just because most modern presidents have been milquetoast leaders barely advocating for anything progressive thereby immediately makes Biden the “most progressive.”  And let’s see Biden ran on a pretty progressive agenda I’ll give you that. And guess what he beat Trump. What about the two other times (Harris and Clinton) with more moderate and centrist candidates? They lost to the worst candidate possible Trump.   When you refer to the midterms was Biden actually able to get the $15 min wage or paid parental and sick leave or even cancel student loans like he was campaigning on? Anything that would fundamentally change people’s lives? Nope. And that’s my point. If a progressive leader like AOC or Bernie can deliver on these issues you will have voters come out in droves. But you need a representative that will ACTUALLY do everything they can to achieve these policies just like Republicans do everything they can to further the interests they represent.,Staplecreate,2025-04-23T23:51:30,20

"Biden *won* his election, and then had his character assassinated (obviously not helped by his obvious decline in health), and his successor, an unpopular minority woman lost by a thin margin without a full campaign season, the weight of not having been through a primary around her neck, and in a plausibly compromised election, to boot.",Hwicc101,2025-04-24T10:53:46,2
"It's silly to call Biden ""ProGressiVe"" when he was just a Republican-lite.  He was a career politician who said what he thought he needed to get elected but then mostly did whatever suited him.  He's a religious freak who put Zionism and supporting Israel above MURDERING CHILDREN, where he violated both US and international law by providing weapons to actors engaged in ethnic cleansing. Biden is a war criminal.  He's also a Catholic and doesn't believe in abortion, which is why after running on protecting abortion rights, his administration didn't even MENTION abortion for the first 2+ years of his presidency. It was only when they needed more money for an election that suddenly they cared again.  Same on environmental concerns: he ran on an anti-fracking campaign, but when in office he immediately expanded fracking. Which - to be clear - is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he just ran on.  He also made the rail strike illegal, which - again, to be clear - was not actually a pro-union move, no matter how you spin it. That's why over 500 labor historians signed a letter objecting to his actions. And that's why only about 25% of the railroad workers actually got the sick leave they were asking for - their collective bargaining was broken by Biden.  So, let's recap our ""progressive"" Joe Biden:  * Religious freak who hates abortion. * Supports murdering children so Israel can steal their land, because religion. * Lied in his campaign promises and actually hates the environment. * Anti-union, broke a large union strike to give workers a fraction of what they were asking for.  He's just an all-around piece of shit which is why he had a 34% approval rating when leaving office.",truthputer,2025-04-24T03:32:10,-2

"You keep going on about electoral data. Obama ran as a transformative candidate with the slogan ""Change we can believe in"" and guess what he won overwhelmingly because people thought he'd genuinely be a progressive change candidate. Joe Biden ran as ""the most progressive"" president because he listened to the left wing members of the Democratic party (particularly Bernie) and ran on increasing minimum wage, paid parental and sick leave, and canceling student loans. Guess what he won. We can also point to Fetterman winning in PA as well running as a progressive in the most highly contested state in the U.S. What happened with Harris and Hillary? Oh right the two candidates running to preserve the status quo and they lost to a dude who speaks at a 3rd grade level.   Second this belief that the ACA is absolutely amazing and is so great is so weird. I'm not disregarding that it didn't help a lot of people but you do understand the ACA is literally a subsidy to the private healthcare industry. It guarantees these companies unlimited money from the government (OUR money) to provide low-cost terrible healthcare service and even straight up commit fraud in order to maximize profits. Look into who initially proposed Obamacare like seriously.   Secondly read up on Obama's handling of bailing out banks during the 2008 housing crisis. As opposed to giving out money directly to devastated home owners he bailed out the big banks responsible for the crisis HOPING that the banks would provide relief to the owners. Shocker they didn't. You know what these banks did instead? They gave more money and bonuses to their executives with the money Obama bailed them out with (Our money). Disgusting. No wonder he massively lost the midterms.   Biden passed ""progressive policies"" but in essence all of the ones that would fundamentally change people's lives like canceling student loans or increasing the minimum wage didn't pass. What did get passed were pretty much government contracts and subsidies to private corporations for things that the government should really be doing.

He went up there and called Ted Cruz' wife ugly and said Marco Rubio has a small dick or whatever. It made people go fucking wild. And then it worked so well that now people believe Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are now a part of the anti-establishment as well simply because they've gained Trump's blessing since.

"Obama's campaign slogan was literally ""change we can believe in."" He was the change candidate and most people at the time believed it.

In what world is running on increasing minimum wage, investing in green new energy, paid parental and sick leave, and canceling student loan not progressive? That's insane.   Again I'm not disregarding the fact that the ACA did improve and helped lots of people. But improving a healthcare system that was already in a terrible state to something barely acceptable is still shit. Not even you can defend the current state of healthcare. Like I said there's a reason why healthcare cost are exorbitant in America and why there's so much news about fraud and malpractice from healthcare providers. Because the ACA is a subsidy for the private healthcare industry. It's the only reason it passed.   And once again we get to the classic argument about how a Democratic president like Obama was in power with a huge mandate from the people of America with majorities in both houses but his hands were tied because of Republicans. There definitely aren't mechanisms to repeal or amend laws he just had to enforce TARP. It's the big bad Republicans again even when Democrats are in power.   Biden did have the votes to pass minimum wage through the reconciliation bill but the parliamentarian ruled against it. Which is funny because Republicans when faced with the same road block fired the parliamentarian on two separate occasions. But for some reason dems didn't do it.      The clear trend is voters are rewarding candidates that run on progressive policies and agenda. Every time they do though they get nothing but empty promises or bread crumbs. They elect Obama overwhelmingly and still get shit healthcare and terrible handling of the housing crisis. Which directly leads to Trump getting elected right after him.  They award Biden because he ran on the most progressive agenda and when nothing fundamentally changes guess what they then revert back to Trump.   How you see voters punishing Dems for being progressive is cognitive dissonance.   So my question is people like you have already supported moderate centrist candidates thinking that they're more electable and they keep losing.

"You're mischaracterizing my point or not even countering them.   I've never once claimed that Obama was a paragon for progressivism. My claim was that he was perceived by many to be a fundamental change actor as the FIRST African American president. Maybe you thought he was a status quo Democrat when he first ran but to the overwhelming amount of people that's just not true at all. Many people believed he would change American society for the better hence why I said when people think someone is going to change something they tend to think that they will change it in a progressive way. Which Obama failed to do.      What do you mean Progressives don't have a monopoly on those ideas? Those are progressive policies so if you run on those policies you are a progressive. That's why Biden is literally believed to be ""the most progressive president of our generation."" Like what? To argue otherwise is crazy.      I never said you couldn't defend the ACA. I said you couldn't defend the current state of the healthcare system even after the ACA was implemented. Marginally improving a terrible system still gets you a marginally better terrible system. It's still terrible. You're literally saying healthcare cost was exorbitantly expensive before the ACA and it's still expensive now which proves my point. I also never said Dems claim ""ACA to be perfect and doesn't need improvements."" My point was that the ACA is primarily a subsidy for the private health care industry and that's the only reason it got passed. Nothing ""progressive"" about it.      Look I'll concede on your Obama's point still terribly mismanaged but definitely doesn't deserve the amount of blame I'm giving him.      Lastly, this argument that progressives need to win more primaries and need to do more x y z is a terrible argument. You understand what ""establishment"" means in establishment democrats right? It means institutional support. Elections don't happen in a vacuum. And establishment dems get all the benefits of corporate and media backing while the left wing progressives don't. The fact that progressives can even get elected in the first place without support like establishment democrats is indicative of how popular these policies and candidates are. The establishment democrats even go out of their way to prevent progressives from getting elected. There's no way you can deny that. This argument that progressives should just win elections completely ignores all these factors and is an extremely naive and ignorant take. So yeah maybe corporate and establishment dems should stop actively hindering left wing progressives but they won't because they know progressives will win. I literally cited Fetterman when he ran for the senate in PA earlier which is a clear indication for progressive policies and candidates.",Staplecreate,2025-04-24T04:09:04,4

Except that isn’t what you said. You said to threaten to do it if Manchin doesn’t vote a particular ways I don’t care if he or his kid gets investigated. I do care if that investigation is tied to a particular vote and is being used as a cudgel to blackmail a senator,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-24T13:04:47,1
"The idea of using an investigation as leverage over a vote is a textbook example of extortion.  If she did something wrong, investigate her for it. Don’t make that investigation contingent on a vote.  Do you understand the difference? Like what you’re suggesting isn’t some grey area. It is textbook extortion. That is a crime. Why do you believe Biden should be using literal extortion?",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-24T13:03:33,1
"What’s naive is blaming the Dems for why progressives can’t get out the vote. The Dems aren’t stopping progressive voters. It actually is that simple. Get out the vote and prove your voting bloc is as large as you claim it to be. You have to win first before everyone will start backing you. That’s what everyone else had to do. Progressives do not get special treatment. The establishment supports their candidates. Progressives need to build relationships, coalitions and a ground game to get out the vote. That takes a lot of work, and it doesn’t happen overnight.   Those policies Biden ran on have been mainstream dem policies since before Sanders threw his hat into the ring in 2016. You seem to not have a clue what mainstream dem policies actually are.",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-24T04:23:26,10

Man it's hard having a discussion with someone who clearly doesn't understand main points. My main point was that even in the face of establishment dems preventing progressives from getting elected these left wing candidates still end up in positions of power. THAT is indicative of how popular these candidates and policies are. In the face of institutional opposition whether it's through corporate money or media they still win. That's a tremendous feat.

"Progressives are impervious to recognizing why they lose elections. I've tried here many times and their entire worldview is predicated on the idea they are being somehow stopped/repressed/stymied from winning because of some other forces. Normally the Democratic Party, the media, big business, billionaires, etc.  It's never that they just aren't popular. But I think this is why so many progressives can easily find themselves under the MAGA banner because victimization and/or conspiracy theories are their bread and butter.",WhiteBoyWithAPodcast,2025-04-24T07:50:23,5
Establishment Dems aren’t stopping progressives from voting. Progressives are stopping themselves from voting. The blame for why you don’t win elections isn’t always on everyone else. It’s on your own voting bloc.  Do establishment Dems like to win primary elections? Absolutely. Winning elections is how you stay in politics.  Progressives need to actually start winning elections if they want to be given everyone’s backing. I’m not sure why you believe they shouldn’t have to earn it like everyone else did.,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-24T11:24:41,1
