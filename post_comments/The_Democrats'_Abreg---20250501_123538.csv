"From the wifes filing: ""the form states that he threatened her and ""told \[her\] ex-mother-in-law that even if he kills me no one can do anything to him.""""  I'm going to refer to him as Killmore Amigo Garcia",Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-05-01T12:37:30,37
"As I keep telling people who think this guy is just your ""average neighbor"". So was Tony Soprano.",AdagioVast,2025-05-01T13:10:28,29
"He was deported because he did not have legal status to remain in the US. If he wants his due process then by all means, please provide proof of US citizenship or a visa or other permission to be present in the US. Otherwise, stfu.  If somebody breaks in to your house they deserve due process but they sure as shit don't get to stay in your house while that plays out.",cossbobo,2025-05-01T13:14:03,37
Its so insane to me the hill they're choosing to die on is for an ILLEGAL immigrant with ties to MS13,Simmumah,2025-05-01T16:01:50,15
I am as conservative as they get but people still deserve due process. Why wasn’t he deported back in 2019 when the first restraining order was filed?,WatchLover26,2025-05-01T16:24:23,10
"I love the arguments against this position. ""WiThOuT dUe PrOcEsS wHaT iF I dEcIdEd YoU wErEn'T a CiTiZeN?""  Well, I have a whole bunch of documents to prove you wrong. I'm certainly not ""undocumented.""",Panzershrekt,2025-05-01T14:56:06,22
Theirs a list of the numerous hearings he received. He got his due process.,Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-05-01T16:28:33,13
There’s a list of the hearings he got where he was convicted of being a criminal?,WatchLover26,2025-05-01T16:29:55,11
"He did appear before an immigration judge in 2019, page 8  [https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1396906/dl?inline](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1396906/dl?inline)  I know I've seen other documents about him being given due process (which I don't think he or any other person inside the US illegally) should get.  If I can find the other stuff, I'll send to you.",Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-05-01T16:49:26,4
"Just read all of it. He was released without even being given a bond because the judge didn’t find that he served a potential threat to the community. he also had no prior criminal arrests or record. Did you even read it all? Look, I voted for Trump all 3 times but we still have to follow the law here. It is what separates us from the rest. I agree he should have been deported but to send him to that jail was not in accordance with the law without a criminal conviction.",WatchLover26,2025-05-01T17:17:29,14
"He was before a judge, he got his due process. There was a list of his cases, some siding against Garcia, some siding for Garcia. That’s due process. I hope I can find it to send to you.",Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-05-01T17:23:29,-2
He was before a judge and didn’t get convicted of anything except for being an illegal alien which he freely admitted to. Please send along whatever you find on any actual convictions of crimes beyond the illegal entry.,WatchLover26,2025-05-01T18:03:49,9
Does it matter? He's an illegal immigrant. He should be deported. Period.,Jonathan-Strang3,2025-05-01T19:20:58,2
"Deported. Yes. Sent to CECOT. No. Not unless he was convicted of criminal and gang activity here in the US. Which he wasn’t. Heck, deport him and then let El Salvador throw him in prison. But don’t send him straight there without a gang related conviction. Come on people. Are we not reasonable human beings that respect the laws in America? I am not even saying he didn’t commit gang related crimes. Just that he wasn’t convicted of any.",WatchLover26,2025-05-01T19:29:48,10
