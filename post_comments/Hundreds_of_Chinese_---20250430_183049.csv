"Actual current event: China's post-covid economy is in the clowntoilet and workers did not get their wages - understandably furious. I'm still pissed the hell off about missing wages in the 2000s and 2010s.  Trump namedropped into every other sentence, because that's cruise control for clicks and ratings.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-30T20:18:32,44
"Ji Feng, a survivor of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest, told RFA that Chinese businesses were in much worse shape than the regime in Beijing was willing to admit, so the blow of Trump’s tariffs struck much harder than it predicted.  Ji said conditions have grown steadily worse since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which forced many businesses into a doom spiral of delaying payroll for as long as possible, then borrowing money to pay back wages once the fury of workers could no longer be contained.  “Some bosses even said that they would rather go to jail than do anything,” Ji said, alluding to the Chinese government’s threats to arrest employers who fail to pay wages for more than three months.  Chinese factory activity is currently experiencing its worst slump since December 2023. Cargo shipments are down by up to 60 percent, while new export orders in April fell to their lowest levels since the pandemic.  Don’t be fooled though, China has 1.3-1.5 billion people, this group protesting is like .003%  of the population. Still early and tariffs need to remain!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-01T00:23:11,11
"Maybe it was never about the tariffs. Perhaps, they wanted distress in China?",angry_baptist,2025-04-30T19:43:12,21
"If tariffs are so bad why has every single country we do business with, set them against us?",chances906,2025-04-30T20:58:58,39
It is so fitting that China's rubber-stamp legislature is the NPC (National People’s Congress).,wanttostaygottogo,2025-05-01T08:13:54,2
Chinese workers protest? Only if it is what the state wants them to protest.  Otherwise they would be ruthlessly put down.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T05:23:38,4
"Some of this is propaganda but don’t be fooled, China will suffer greatly and will not win this tariff issue. President Trump playing chess while others cannot stop countering with playing checkers.  China, you are in a world of hurt and you CCP members know it. A reality check for you!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-01T00:19:06,0
But I thought “China is a communist dictatorship and won’t be hurt by this and will weather this just fine. No civil unrest or internal strife at all.”,ITrCool,2025-04-30T22:05:44,24
Does the stamp look like the logo for this website?,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-01T08:41:24,1
"They've been protesting all along despite the danger, but yes they do get cracked down on. Remember the tankman of tiananmen square, the CCP wants us to pretend nobody protests just like the Dems want us to pretend their cities are safe and prosperous. There was also the Hong Kong protest wave with the laser pointers a few years back, not the only times there's ever been unrest there.  But yes, they do get cracked down on.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-01T08:39:48,2
"Ha, it is hurting China big time, don’t kid yourself! Yes, I know you get it!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-01T00:15:43,4
"I watched it as it happened. Yeah I remember it.  And despite the lies of China, it was found out that over 10,000 or more were massacred.  Hong Kong is a strange situation. It is and is not China. In their Hearts they are not China. It is also difficult to crack down on people who disappear into the woodwork and wear masks all the time. From what I can determine, masks in Hong Kong are due to the smell of the city. It makes Elizabeth New Jersey smell like a rose garden.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T11:11:56,2
"\>due to the smell of the city  *""fragrant harbor""*  It's also a city of skyscrapers, if someone figures out how to make downtown concretesville smell good they should patent it.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-01T11:27:12,2
"Fragrant Harbor, like the Boston Harbor a few decades back when you could walk across it?  I avoid any city if possible.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T11:31:48,2
"Walk across the smell? Brings me back to the unethical cow farms in SoCal from the 20th century, before they became supermegasuburbs.  (I wonder if the modern residents know...)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-01T11:35:50,2
No walk across the harbor... not really but it sure seemed like it back in the 70's.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T11:42:39,1
