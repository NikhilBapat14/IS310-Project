"Is stating ""Jesus wouldn't like what Trump is doing"" anti-christian?",Jubjars,2025-04-23T19:47:14,11
"You can deport me, I strongly advocate for abolishing all religions. All of them are used to control and enslave populations, start wars, commit genocides and even abuse our children.   A world without religions will be a better place.   It's not even a anti-christian bias, it's my belief as an atheist.  My speech and freedom of religion are supposed to be protected by the Constitution. You want to really deport me for that? Kick me out of my job?   If yes you are a radical christo-nazi.",NorthenFreeman,2025-04-23T19:09:26,23

"The First Amendment guarantees religious freedom The First Amendment, one of the more symbolic and litigious of the amendments, guarantees fundamental rights including freedom of religion, speech, and the press, and the rights to assemble peacefully and to petition the government.  Two provisions of the First Amendment relate to religion. They prevent Congress from adopting any laws “respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”  Adopted at a time when some states had established religions, which received state support, the prohibition against congressional legislation initially left these establishments in place, to be gradually eliminated by the sates themselves — Massachusetts, the last state to do so, did this in 1833.  The establishment clause has long been associated with the idea of separation of church and state and has, in more recent times, been used to prohibit state-sponsored devotional prayer, Bible reading, and related practices in public schools; to limit governmental aid to parochial schools; and, at times, to strike down state-sponsored religious displays.  For many years, the Supreme Court employed a three-part Lemon Test, named for the 1971 Supreme Court decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). It required that laws have a secular purpose, that their primary effect neither advance nor inhibit religion, and that they did not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.” In recent years, the Supreme Court has largely abandoned this test, often paying great attention to historical practices and focusing primarily on whether laws discriminate against religious entities and/or whether practices have a coercive influence on participants, especially in classroom settings.",mancusjo1,2025-04-23T19:09:28,4
