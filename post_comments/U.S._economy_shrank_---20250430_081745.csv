Looking forward to being told the economy is a “hostile and political act” ,PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-30T08:18:55,13
"Trump’s tariffs slowed the economy so fast, economists are checking if the brakes were made in China.",TubeframeMR2,2025-04-30T08:18:26,6
"Note that last November if Harris won and continued Biden's policies the economy was projected to continue growing at a steady 2 to 2.5% for the entire year.  This is a 3% drop, not a 0.3% drop.  Also note that the economic projections for a Trump win were worst case a 0.5% contraction, and best-case zero growth.  We were warned.  What we were not warned about is what is coming next.  The dollar has shrunk by 10% because the world is no longer viewing the USA as a safe harbor for their investments.  That belief is the foundation of our economy.  Trump is cracking it.",guttanzer,2025-04-30T09:22:11,4
And we haven't felt the entire effect of the tariffs yet.,box-cable,2025-04-30T09:03:15,2
"But as the administration said yesterday, I'm sure we'll be fine because businesses preordered ahead of time.  smh",twistedt,2025-04-30T08:27:16,1
"Covid saved Trump's ass in the last administration by masking the fact that we were in recession thanks to the GOP's awful policies. The media completely failed to make Americans aware of this and here we are going through it again. Next quarter when the economy has shrunk again and we're in full on recession, there will be nothing to mask his failures. Maybe that's why the admin is so focused on eliminating all manner of food safety and virus control efforts.",FizzgigsRevenge,2025-04-30T08:35:30,1
Prediction : Trump goes after the Commerce Department claiming they produce fake data.,rapidcreek409,2025-04-30T08:37:36,1
Those are rookie numbers.,Deerdance21,2025-04-30T10:27:10,1
"Well in this case, as it is a forced mini recession it is.",Megaphonestory,2025-04-30T08:22:50,1
"Maybe he will, maybe he wont, but he will make sure they produce more positive and up-lifing numbers in the future regardless of those pesky facts.",rgvtim,2025-04-30T08:51:05,1
