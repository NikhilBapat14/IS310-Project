"The issue of Islam - and its theological/historical propensity for generating violence and intolerance - is perhaps THEE most important one for me in terms of gauging political judgment. No other issue in the sociological landscape so clearly delineates for me the clear-minded from the myopic. Israel/Palestine is just one manifestation of that larger issue. This is one of the main reasons I myself embraced conservatism some 30 years ago. Many conservatives were just as deluded as liberals (e.g., George Bush declaring repeatedly after 9-11: ""Islam is peace"")....but it was *only* conservatives who were challenging the obtuse, mindless, obsequious ""religion of peace"" narrative that has captured our media and institutions.  Given all of that, I can't help but appreciate Fetterman. I don't like the fact that he's a Dem....or that he's philosophically liberal on most issues. But in this one, critical test of political judgment, he surely passes.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-03T17:39:21,6
