"Ugg. More clickbait BS from the Post. They use the fact that this person was a member of the Bush admin to give the idea credence but the article states very clearly that there is nothing they saw at that job that has anything to do with this. It is all based on some conspiracy theory level ""math"" that they then extrapolate.  The sad reality is the math they ""expose"" over a 25 year period could have been anything from theft to a zillion other secret programs to waste government money.

">I mean, we knew this already.  We know nothing at all on the level of Fitt's claims. Why are you reinforcing the ravings of someone evidently incapable of critical reasoning on social media?  >The government has been building underground cities for the rich and powerful since the 1950s.   There are no underground cities. Can you provide a definition of city for one able to exist underground? Then we can say underground city. If you can't reasonably do that, run with ""bunker"". In your example, ""nuclear bunker""   Can you explain what you mean by the ""Rich and Powerful""? For example, who is ""rich and powerful"" that get to go into Cheyenne or Greenbriar? Raven rock? I'm fairly rich and thus powerful and do not have an admission pass.   I'm unable to see past the lack of conspiracy raising precision as I react against the banal and vapid NyPost article that has little bearing on reality.

That is why I find old fashioned graft and fraud a much more likely explanation.  The idea that all of the money went to one goal is far fetched. It is MUCH more likely that is a bunch of moneyed interests doing smaller crap for themselves.,MasterK999,2025-05-05T12:59:21,3

">There are thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the continental United States...  This is because TBM's are a thing.  There are also thousands of miles outside of the Continental US. There is such extreme agreement here, you shouldn't have even bothered noting it.  >Abandoned subway systems, unused service routes, and deserted mine shafts...  Yup. You can increase your number when you include utility and other non-human use tunnels such as for water and sewage transport.  >Many have no known purpose at all.  How do you know this? You are pulling an idea out of thin air and doing backhanded conspiracy mongering.   Are you able to add any value to the preposterous idea that trillions of dollars have been spent on secret cities for the rich and powerful with some under the sea?
