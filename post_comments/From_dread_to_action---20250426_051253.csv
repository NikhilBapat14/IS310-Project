"“As of Friday afternoon, the Impact Counter estimates that the funding discontinuation and terminations will result in 70,856 adult deaths and 147,852 child deaths at a combined rate of 103 deaths per hour.”  Unconscionable",ContentSherbert934,2025-04-26T07:32:19,26

"The could have killed more, if they tried a little harder. I'm sure these numbers give Trump, Musk and the Billionaire Oligarchs great comfort when they look at their portfolios. To think they used to pay taxes, how stupid is that?",NoReserve7293,2025-04-26T05:39:10,9
"Crazy Donald doesn't care if these people live or die. He's like a toddler - the only thing that matters is how many people are paying attention to him right now, and these people weren't paying attention to him, so they get to die.",dan7315,2025-04-26T06:40:57,6
They should put up a national death clock in Times Square.,Psychicgoat2,2025-04-26T07:51:08,6
"The  United States Agency for International Development is a CIA tool for taking down socialist movements in other countries. USAID can die, but the little support it actually did (not the crap they constantly lied about like when they tried to create a social media psyop to start a coup in Cuba) should be restored as something else entirely. That help doesnt need to come from a program that gives out hand grenade shaped awards.",Only_Chans,2025-04-26T11:24:54,1
"I'd been wondering about this, that is genuinely horrifying. That we're almost at 100k dead just already is... it boggle the mind, and puts in perspective how little the public grasps of how bad it is already.",TemetN,2025-04-26T13:22:03,1
The Chinese are going to step Up and support where the US backs down.  The US are no longer going to be the world leaders they presume to be.   It’s a change,Maleficent_Pay_4154,2025-04-26T16:27:35,1
Murderers. Plain and simple.  And that doesn’t count the Covid deaths Trump caused. The suicides he caused..,LifeguardNo9762,2025-04-26T17:30:24,1
"While I’m not in any way doubting that cuts to USAID are devastating and result in gross loss of life, I’m curious as to the methodology behind these figures.   It would help their cause if they made that public I think.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-04-26T07:26:37,0

"as a Harris voter, she needs to not run again and let the fucking party primary a damn candidate. The deaths are on the Democrats hands as well, for such bullshit resistance. Also, voting for Harris and getting the W would unironically put a different set of deaths on you wouldn't it. I guess at least Mahmoud Kahlil would be able to protest without being black bagged. We upend the rule of law everywhere we throw our militias at. The second it comes home the fence sitters cry fascism, unwilling to do anything other than slobbering on a placard. You are all fucking hypocrites for letting this happen.",Sensitive_Low8379,2025-04-27T00:44:25,0

"Uh huh. Everyone who didn't vote for HRC in 2016 or Harris in 2024 are responsible for those deaths in some way; whether they voted for Trump or not, they declined to prevent Trump.",Public_Front_4304,2025-04-26T06:44:05,12
> Trump is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths during COVID-19  He did no better or worse than the average european country.  Democrats would have killed far more. See Cuomo and DeBlasio,epicstruggle,2025-04-26T08:02:27,-20
