"I haven't read World Order, so perhaps my explanation is different than what Kissinger has in mind.   In US political discourse the term alliance has at times had a negative connotation based on the warning about 'entangling alliances' by George Washington. An alliance can be seen as negative, because a state will have to go to war in case an allied country is attacked, otherwise an alliance is meaningless. That means you can get sucked into someone else's war. With warfare being quite common between European powers historically, that is quite a risk.   Wilson tried to sell his vision for the world after World War I in the form of his Fourteen points plan and the League of Nations. The distinction he made between ordinary or the old form of alliances and the new form is that the former was between two or a few states, whereas the latter is an alliance between all (or at least many) (democratic) states. The collective security element is that if one of these countries is attacked, all other allied states respond as if they were attacked at the same time by the aggressor state. Does this explanation make it clearer?  What I think Kissinger is arguing is that it is a nice idea, but does not necessarily work in practice. One question that was asked in France on the eve of World War II was: ""Pourquoi mourir pour Dantzig?"", ""Why die for Danzig/Gdansk?"". In short, why would you want to send your own men to their death for a war between foreign countries? The assumption is that these allied foreigners would also send their men in case your own country is attacked, but why would they? Is that a realistic promise? In the case of Munich '38 it showed that the Western powers were not willing to send their troops against Nazi Germany over the Sudetenland, even if Czechslovakia was formally their ally. This of course only emboldened Hitler to invade Poland as well.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2023-01-09T04:42:43,3
