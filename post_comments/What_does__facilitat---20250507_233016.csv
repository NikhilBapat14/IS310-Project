"I think it was an intentionally vague ruling, designed to make both sides feel like they won without actually accomplishing anything.   The speed at which they moved it through the system suggests they just wanted to move past it ASAP",JoKo13,2025-05-08T11:46:13,9
"if he ever comes back, a hearing will be held, his order of withholding terminated as the gang he feared no longer exists and he will be deported either back to el salvador or some other country if el salvador refuses him",SerendipitySue,2025-05-08T13:39:50,4

"I'm too ignorant to know what the courts intended with the ""facilitate"" order.  In my opinion, Facilitate means:  1. Ask, in good faith, for those responsible for detaining the person to allow us to return the person. 2. Provide the resources to bring back the person in question.  The El Salvadorian president stated that he would not return the person if asked. He said that in front of the camera in front of the US president. I think that implies #1, though I think some people would appreciate seeing Trump actually ask in front of the cameras. I'm sure it will be spun negatively no matter what, however.  It also should mean that the Trump admin can't conspire with the El Salvadorian president to do a fake ask and deny.  \#2 can't happen if #1 is a ""no"".  \---  If we are funding his detainment in El Salvador, then I think we would need to cut that funding as well. This is a very gray area.",spootieho,2025-05-08T16:19:39,1

"Yeah that makes sense, the fact that people are still talking about this all over the place nearly 2 months later tells me Democrats don't have anything else to try and drag this administration.

"Yes, the reason for withhold of deport to El Salvador was Barrio 18 which would not likely be a threat to him anymore.  The withhold should be lifted.  And really the withhold from deport shouldn't have been used for gang violence.  It shouldn't be used for domestic violence.  It's too easy to claim either to get a stay.  The threat of going straight to prison might be cause for another ""withhold of deport"" from a soft hearted judge.",spootieho,2025-05-08T16:22:45,2
"Yeah I definitely don't love the funding, however it's a small price to pay to get rid of trende aragua after their country wouldn't take them back.   But I was thinking about it, Trump has executive privilege. If they really questioned his good faith he could easily say that he already had another conversation with the president of El Salvador and could not find a resolution to getting back Garcia. He could totally be full of shit And there will be no way to prove it. So I think it's more along the lines of acknowledging that the government fucked up and making it clear that the presidents administration needs to make sure they do better in the future",fordr015,2025-05-08T16:28:07,2
"But the Supreme Court also said ""The District Court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.""

"Doesn't mean that at all, has he been brought back?  Nope nor will he, Trump should just ask the prison to deport him to another country's prison.  The lower court doesn't like where he was deported to, so simply deport him to another country's prison, that ends everything.",disappointedFed,2025-05-08T12:59:48,6
"You mean like 2 hearings where judges established affiliation with MS13 and he was set to be deported pending an immigration hearing to assess the ""threat"" from Barrio 18?  Just send an agent to el Salvador and get the hearing over with. Why bring him back to just deport him again and have him likely file a lawsuit with an activist judge that will invariably have another universal injunction? This is not due process, he already had it and what the trump admin did was the equivalent of a clerical error.  Due process for immigration cases is not a trial by jury. Criminal prosecution of the violent activity within the states would require ""do whatever is needed"" - not this",GTGD3,2025-05-08T17:19:35,2

There's a current total of 230 cases against the Trump administration in court. This indicates that the Kilmar Garcia case is far from the only thing the Democrats have against the administration.

">In an exclusive interview with ABC News to mark his 100th day in office, **President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he ""could"" secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia**, the Maryland man his administration said in court was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.  >""Now the Supreme Court has upheld an order that you must return him to the-- facilitate his return to the United States.

Aren't like 95% of those Democrat appointed judges? Didn't one of those rulings just get shot down because they tried to allow schizophrenic people in the military? It's hardly rational to pretend that these judges are acting in good faith. Obama deported far more people and didn't face any of these injunctions. I'm sure there is a handful of legitimate rulings but at this point this is the establishment trying to prevent the president from upholding the Constitution and is oath of office. Deporting illegal immigrants is literally one of the things he was elected to do.   If they want to continue down this path I guarantee you he will suspend habeas corpus for illegal immigrants and the left will throw a grand in royal fit and probably get violent but there's already legal precedent.,fordr015,2025-05-08T17:19:38,4
"I wasn't giving him advice I was saying there's no real argument to be made about compliance when it comes to how much effort somebody puts in. That is completely subjective. On national television he asked the president of El Salvador if he would return Garcia and the president said no. There's no doubt that it wasn't a serious question and there's no doubt that if Trump actually wanted him back he probably could get him back. But that's not how compliance works. If the supreme Court ordered the president to bring this man back without setting the parameters of how he should accomplish such a task, Then it's one of the possibilities that the president could lie, or he can make another phone call and ask again with the same tone, get the same answer And now he would have the exact same plausible deniability. Or we can just accept the fact that the word facilitate doesn't mean what the Democrats are claiming it means.",fordr015,2025-05-08T17:22:41,2
