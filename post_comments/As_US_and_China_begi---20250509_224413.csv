Xi should get that [chinese Trump impersonator](https://youtu.be/RIS5EKhFYFI) to be his translator.  Then we'd be hearing Trump arguing with Trump. Comedy gold.,iodisedsalt,2025-05-09T23:52:47,13
"So fucking weird how he keeps publicly announcing big concessions just prior to beginning negotiations.   Not that 80% is like...functionally all that much better than 145%? But I really doubt his understanding of the underlying economics is sufficient to grasp this.   How anyone actually believes this man is a business genius is beyond me. He's out there shitting his pants, figuratively and literally.",sp0rkah0lic,2025-05-10T01:44:07,9

"I can understand why the Western banks decided the man was radioactive.   Even if you look past the personality, the numbers don't lie, and a man who has a tendency to declare his businesses bankrupt and leave his creditors holding the can is not who you want as a client.  I can even understand why Russia's okay with that.  If you're looking to launder money, who cares if the businesses you invest in fail from time to time?  As long as you get get a good chunk back from what you put in, you're happy - any business that by some miracle turns a profit is a bonus.  But no business can function without a lot of other people and other organisations.  And who in their right mind wants to work with a man who wants to renegotiate everything every twenty minutes?",jimicus,2025-05-10T04:33:57,3

Tell him to wear a Winnie the Pooh costume also.,Zalnar,2025-05-10T01:04:45,2
Don't Presidents typically bring gifts as a mark of respect?  And Trump is precisely the sort of person who'd think a Winnie the Pooh mug is an appropriate gift for a world leader.,jimicus,2025-05-10T04:22:02,1
"No I agree with all of this. Trump has made a fortune with money laundering, and then has absolutely abused the tax and bankruptcy systems to collapse his pump and dump ""front"" companies.   He's definitely an expert at being a brazen criminal grifter.  I guess that's what passes as ""business savvy"" in the USA these days ðŸ«¤",sp0rkah0lic,2025-05-10T05:00:17,2
