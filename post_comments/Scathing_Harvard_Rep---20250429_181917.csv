"The report details similar incidents at the School of Public Health, where Jewish students raised concerns over anti-Israel webinars only to be asked, ""Who is more marginalized, Jews or Palestinians?"" At the Divinity School, Jewish students were subject to ""the embrace of a pedagogy of 'de-zionization'"" in which instructors ""attribute to Jews two great sins: first, in the Levant, the establishment of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Nakba; and second, in the United States, participation in White supremacy."" The report comes at a difficult time for Harvard, with the university engaged in a high-profile fight with the Trump administration over its federal funding.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-29T18:42:36,8
"This 'politicized instruction' is not limited to Israel/Palestine and is surely not limited to Harvard. It is a characteristic of almost every university in the country and applies to a plethora of subjects throughout the humanities. The over-riding theme is the evils of Western civilization.....which is ironic given that the West is perhaps the most progressive, tolerant civilization in human history. And the proof is in the pudding: What other civilization allows itself to be systematically attacked and deconstructed within its own university apparatus?",Vessarionovich,2025-04-30T06:41:12,1
"The educated elite will always point out countries that have the most freedoms, better human rights records and opportunities. America, U.K. Canada, some European countries. Because they allow (mostly) free speech and don’t target political groups intent on taking these countries down.   Now, criticize Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, no one does that in these countries because they will disappear and be gone for good.  I honestly think a lot of this is being funded by these countries (China and certain Middle East countries) in order to overthrow and take over the U.S.   Because I see it working in the UK.",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-30T08:46:06,1
