"> David’s Bridal has sped up moving its production out of China because of tariffs. By July, it aims to produce all of its dresses in other countries, including Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.  Weird, I was told that all of these factories would immediately be moved to the United States.",throwawaylol666666,2025-05-05T18:40:20,20
"> An estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China, according to the National Bridal Retailers Association.  These 6000+ small businesses are gonna have a rough ride without a tariff exemption.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-05T18:39:33,5
"This is something that hasn't been discussed much. China imports are more than just stuff we buy from Amazon or Temu. There are plenty of American business that rely on Chinese imports to operate their business. By cutting off China imports (which is the effect of a 140%+ tariffs), we are bankrupting these American businesses, resulting in massive layoffs.",xibeno9261,2025-05-05T20:13:39,5
My friend bought a used dress from a resale site in the U.K. and TSA charged her with China tariffs because that’s where the dress was originally manufactured. How??,Free-Organization974,2025-05-06T15:45:03,1

They can move the factory but not the employees. Try finding a worker who knows how to sew on a button. “Look for the Union Label” is long gone. China didn’t steal the manufacturing. Corporations wanted the extra profits and sought them out.,fairoaks2,2025-05-05T18:58:52,9

Our people will do it for 35/hour and only use 2 of the 4 holes.  That Chernobyl Cole miners joke now rings true for Americans.,RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-05T20:45:54,3

It's an old joke brides use to tell their future husbands (who usually are helping pay for the wedding and dress) that it's a justified expense because their future daughter who will get to wear that dress.  Oh yeah....then why isn't the future bride wearing her mom's dress.  I stole that joke from an old show in the 90s.,RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-05T20:52:58,1
