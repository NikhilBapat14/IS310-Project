Totally true.   And we shouldn't forget that tariffs are taxes. The word **tariff** is just another way to say **import tax**. Republicans are supporting a HŪGE tax hike.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-06T09:39:57,3
Farmers will NEVER protest they are more scared of Trump punishing them by taking away subsidies. Since we are not supporting other countries anymore should farmers still get subsidies?  Maybe they should stand on their own for a change.  Just being factious but I think it’s time farmers stood for democrats.,AKbootjack,2025-04-06T14:26:56,1
I think the chaos is the point.  You know damn well they’ve positioned themselves to benefit from the downturn and all he needs to do is remover / lower the tariffs to get a bounce back.,[deleted],2025-04-06T20:04:46,1
