It's the Russians. Was there any doubt in any reasonable person's mind? No. Russians.,[deleted],2022-10-02T11:34:17,0
"> That could be mostly everyone except Germany.  Its the opposite.  Germany is one of the most likely suspects (alongside US and Poland), as its government was threatened by Nord Stream. They couldn't turn it on without violating their own commitments, while keeping it turned off was already causing dissent. By winter, there'd massive social unrest, with riots and attempts to depose government.  Destruction of Nord Stream ensures that there is no reason to kick Scholz out, as there'd be no gas even if Germany removes sanctions.",S_T_P,2022-10-03T12:58:27,1
"Most countries are favouring the sabotage explanation (some haven't expressly ruled out malfunction), but the public hasn't been provided with any evidence indicating who is responsible.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-10-04T07:50:40,1
"It doesn’t make rational sense for it to be the Russians. But it’s safe to say Putin is no longer making rational decisions, and is not receiving factual information or good advice from his inner circle.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-10-02T12:19:48,6
Nordstream wasn’t off due to sanctions. Russia actually shut the stream off for maintenance at the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine and just…kept it off. Your theory doesn’t really make sense then because Germany doesn’t actually have the power to turn it back on unilaterally.,dunpyklungo,2022-10-05T15:51:29,1
"I would guess that Putin is trying to stay in power, and it prevents internal politics from pushing for reconciliation with the west because now it is no longer possible to sell them gas.  They'd probably figure that the west would foot the bill to fix the pipeline either way, so why not make it more expensive for them to do so.",FRCP_12b6,2022-10-02T13:07:22,1
"It could be a double wammy of the russians trying to make us think it was an inside job done by a NATO country, but I doubt it. Probably just an inside job to gain leverage over russia",Altruistic_Extent_89,2022-10-05T03:44:37,1
That was Nord Stream 1. Nord Stream 2 was perfectly functional and not working only because Germany was refusing to use it.,S_T_P,2022-10-06T00:45:12,2
"You could just as easily say that it was Biden's plan to destroy the one major piece of leverage that Russia had over Germany. Now Germany is forced to fully commit to NATO because the last piece of geopolitical concern that would have pushed Germany toward Russia is gone. The West is never going to fix Nordstream; it would only enrich Russia and the USA wants to take its place as the major supplier of European energy.   TL;DR You can make the case that both sides wanted to destroy the pipeline. What is certain, however, is that the common person pays the price for both Russian **AND** NATO warmongering.",paceminterris,2022-10-03T00:55:21,2
"In the short term, perhaps.  In the long term, Europe will fix their energy supply issue and be more independent in that regard going forward.  Russia will in-turn increase exports to other countries that are willing to put up with their geopolitics.",FRCP_12b6,2022-10-04T08:44:52,1
"Which country(s) were trying to push for more nuclear plants? I like nuclear power, but I feel like if the Russia situation heats up, they would be prime targets.",Altruistic_Extent_89,2022-10-05T03:47:15,1
