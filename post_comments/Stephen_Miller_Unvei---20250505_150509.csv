“No Due Process” was right there in the MAGA Carta.,specqq,2025-05-05T15:15:18,253
">The right of “due process” is to protect citizens from their government, not to protect foreign trespassers from removal. Due process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation.  This is a variation of the argument made by the right-wing Hillsdale College in their pitch against birthright citizenship.  There is more to the attack on birthright citizenship than meets the eye.  The goal of ending birthright citizenship is just a means to a much worse end.  The right's real intent is redefine what it is to be born subject to US jurisdiction so that they can take the next leap of redefining what it is to be subject to US jurisdiction under all circumstances.  The step that follows is for the courts not having any jurisdiction at all over anyone who the executive branch determines is excluded from that jurisdiction.  Using their birthright citizenship argument, that ""subject to jurisdiction"" determination will be based upon whether the executive decides that this person is subject to an undefined ""social contract"" that determines whether or not the court has jurisdiction.  The definition of jurisdiction is not particularly controversial and would at least on the surface appear to remain as is.  The issue will become who is excluded from it, and that determination would be made by the executive branch without the courts.  This ""social contract"" is sufficiently vague that it can exclude whatever or whoever Dear Leader wants it to.",I405CA,2025-05-05T15:42:02,171

"The illegals came into our country without any process accept for being assigned a social security number so the biden administration could then sign illegals up for the highest tiered social security benefit and also snap benefits at the highest levels and why didn’t the Biden administration want to try to find the 300,00 children that went missing on their watches.  They refused to go look for them .  The democrats voted against a bill that would allow the illillegal children to only get picked up by family members by a process with ones dna but no the democrats said and so these illegal children went missing and into sex trafficking and other horrible acts that they forced upon these children like child labor in dangerous conditions and to me this is horrible .  The fact that illegals were assigned social security numbers and were allowed to collect social security benefits that every American since their first job was getting docked money that then went into our social security account that Biden decided to allow illegals to then get paid these benefits and they never ever paid into it .  They were given insurance and snap benefits to buy food with.  All taking away from the American people .. also it has been obscenely burdening the states social services programs making mostly the sanctuary cities then ask the federal govt for more funding seeing they were drained from the constant influx of illegals into these Sancuary cities .. veterans were being kicked out ot homeless shelters for then letting the illegals take the veterans spot .. so you all think the United States can take on all this extra expenses seeing were already at a deficit of nearly 36 trillion dollars but if our country stays on this projected influx of allowing illegals to collect benefits that are for American citizens than wr just will not have a country left it’ll eventually implode or be forced to pay even more taxes to our federal government., Kamala Harris wanted t tax at a rate of 40% so much higher then ever before .  So then the democrats can stay in power seeing they now got illegals to vote for them all .. also when doing the United States census it’ll open up more democratic seats in the house and senate causing more seats amongst the democrats as the census should only count American citizens but the democrats voted against that too .  You all are so quick to insult so many when you don’t seem to know what exactly is at stake in our country .

"The nuance here is that they are not arguing against the concept of due process.  They are arguing that there is due process but that not everyone is entitled to it.  The jurisdiction argument is going to provide at least some of the basis for this.  You weren't born to a legal resident, so you were not born subject to US jurisdiction because your birth was not consistent with the social contract.  You came here illegally, so you are not subject to US jurisdiction because your lack of legal status makes your presence in the US inconsistent with the social contract.  You are a member of another group that we have determined is not consistent with affiliation with the broader vague social contract as the White House has defined it, so you are not subject to US jurisdiction.  Because you are not subject to US jurisdiction, you are excluded from due process and can be deported.  The court plays no role, since it has no jurisdiction over those who are not subject to US jurisdiction.  The keys here are: (a) who gets to decide who is subject to the social contract and (b) what process is used to decide it.  This makes the ""social contract"" fair game for whatever they want to be.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of **citizens** of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any **person** of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any **person** within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.    I don't see how anybody could turn that to say the intent is that due process is not for everybody.   (For those wondering btw, an illegal immigrant *is* ""subject to the jurisdiction"" because otherwise being illegal wouldn't be a crime, they wouldn't pay taxes etc. That clause means that if the US is invaded, the enemy soldiers can't start birthing on their soil and claim to be US citizens. In *that* situation, it would be covered by international treaties about treating POWs, judgement being dependant on orders from the other country etc.)",laplongejr,2025-05-06T07:12:51,3
"Trump went to Wharton, but probably didn’t deserve to be there, or stay there once he was there.  BTW, an important point about this due process topic: trying to differentiate between whether just US citizens get it, or anyone residing here, has another aspect to it: if you are shipped off without due process, how would they even know if you are a citizen or not?

"The argument is a crock of shit though.  The text of the 14th Amendment Section 1.  >All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  This makes the following clear:  1.  It defines birthright citizenship. 2.  It classifies born citizens and naturalized citizens as part of a larger group - those subject to the jurisdiction of the US. 3.  The United States nor any subsequent State shall not make or enforce laws abridging the rights of citizens 4.  The United States nor any subsequent State shall not deprive any person of rights without due process. 5.  Equal protection for the law is for all under our jurisdiction, not just citizens.  Or else the entire amendment differentiating citizens and non-citizens would have just said ""citizens"" rather than ""any person within its jurisdiction"" 6.  ""Any person"" and ""any person without its jurisdiction"" are not the exact same thing.",obi-jawn-kenblomi,2025-05-05T17:01:58,25

However, the decision in Wong was based upon his birthplace, not the legal status of his parents.    The essence of the decision in Wong Kim Ark is that parentage is largely irrelevant to the determination of citizenship.
