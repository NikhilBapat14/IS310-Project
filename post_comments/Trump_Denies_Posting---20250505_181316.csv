"> “I had nothing to do with it,” Mr. Trump said while taking questions in the Oval Office. “Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope, and they put it out on the internet. That’s not me that did it, I have no idea where it came from — maybe it was A.I. But I have no idea where it came from.”       It was posted under an account bearing his name and likeness, one which he has used before for official presidential declarations, but now he doesn’t even know what social media is… “*What is that? Do people post things on it? Never heard of it before.*”",heismanwinner82,2025-05-05T18:18:03,156

"I didn’t see the whole quote, but it’s entirely possible he means he didn’t create the image itself and his comments are not related to the actually posting of the image on his account. That being said, dude is still a complete idiot for reposting anything even remotely close to that. Did he not read the Left Behind series?
