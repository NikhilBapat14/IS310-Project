"Highly positive.  There is areas where some criticism over some of his later actions (GLP, Cultural Revolution) is acceptable, but since President Xi took over the party itself has sorta cut-down criticism and gone back to mostly hero-worship.  There has been a huge revival in Maoism in general the last few decades in reaction to many of the problems that have risen since the reform era.  > Do demographic divides such as rich or poor,rural or urban and educated or uneducated play a big part in deciding between positive or negative views on Mao?   My understanding is that age is actually a big factor:  older people tend to be critical because they remember the faults of Mao while younger people tend to have a romanticized view of him.",Naliamegod,2023-05-15T17:47:23,1
