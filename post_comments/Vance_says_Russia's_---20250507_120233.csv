"Russia has no reason to reduce their demands. They think we aren’t going to give enough aid to make a difference and that we really want a deal, so they are offering crappy terms to us that are better terms for them than staying in the war.  They will take a deal if it’s better than staying at war.   That means we either need to give them a lot, too much in this case per Vance’s comments, or we need to make staying at war have a much lower expected return in their eyes, then a less juicy deal becomes a good deal for them.   The way we do the second is commit to spin up our domestic manufacturing of ammunition and missiles very significantly, which we need to do anyway and makes good jobs as well, and pledge the initial output to Ukraine for as long as the war is going on.  We might do the same on lower cost drones as well. That changes the economics a lot for Russia and they’ll want a deal. Then we are left with a larger stockpile and the ability to surge production in a future conflict which we need anyway. Most likely we’ll send almost none of that to Ukraine, the credible threat alone changes the economics here and ultimately this ends up about money and territory and feasibility for them.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-07T12:28:11,58
One hopes we are working behind the scenes with European and Asian powers to put the squeeze on Putin if need be should he refuse to negotiate in good faith.,Briguy28,2025-05-07T12:09:11,26
"> Russia has no reason to reduce their demands. They think we aren’t going to give enough aid to make a difference and that we really want a deal, so they are offering crappy terms to us that are better terms for them than staying in the war.  Pretty much.   It was a pretty bad geo-political move for Trump to say he can end the conflict on day 1.   It's like walking into a car dealership and being like ""Hey man I needed a car yesterday, what kind of deal can you give me?"" You're gonna get taken to the cleaners.   If the end goal is to not let Ukraine give up any land, you gotta be willing to walk away from the negotiating table and commit to giving Ukraine every resource they need to defeat Russia, even if you're bluffing.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-07T14:02:08,49
"Whatever happens diplomatically is happening behind the scenes, whatever happens openly and out loud is either combat footage or goobers narrating from a distance.  >""We think that if cool heads prevail here, we can bring this thing to a durable peace that will be economically beneficial for both Ukrainians and the Russians,"" Vance said.   Have we found common diplomatic ground with the other side yet? I feel like this is *being hinted at all over the media without actually being there\*.* Any agreement to which Ukraine is not party is just a suggestion as long as Ukraine still exists, and their executive is still saying fight fight fight.  (pro-elections)  \*And I worry the mainstream is misleading people to think Russia has a smaller presence at the table than they do, thus leaving people bewildered when Russia asserts itself.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T13:52:36,8
"I think President Trump assumed he will be dealing with sane people that want the stupid war to end, not with psycho warmongers.",AstraVolans_21,2025-05-07T14:08:50,-10
Well he did go in with an open mind but the way the neoconservatives were describing it turns out to have been accurate and he appears to be seeing that now. He can still take a different path and kind of has by forcing Europe to do more.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-07T14:33:04,22
I don’t think Vladimir Putin is a sane person. I think he’s a psycho warmonger.   I think maybe I understand the angle Trump was going for as to not aggravate him further but you’ve gotta go in all negotiations knowing you’re dealing with a psycho warmonger. Not a sane person.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-07T16:45:18,18

You think the guys in the other side are sane? Considering they most likely knew the probable outcome of the stupid war?,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-08T11:44:21,-1
I’ve seen a lot over this war. Ukraine is drafting people but low % of pop. Russia is doing straight up ethnic cleansing of its minority regions and also of Ukrainian territories it occupied. It’s not even close.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T12:03:43,6
How do you know all of this? How many people capable of going to war are left in Ukraine?,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-08T12:11:29,0
"A ton. They are no where near total war footing. But the same is true of Russia. They’ve resisted drafting more heavily and have given up some territory instead of meat grinding more infantry. It’s a critique levied by some of the neocon adjacent OSINT groups like ISW. Russia is doing the same, neither country has a high growth rate and doesn’t want to put males with education or skills on the front lines. What Russia has that Ukraine doesn’t is asian and Muslim minorities they don’t mind killing off and kind of seem to prefer to, and also an ability to force draft ukranians into the meat grinder as they are also minorities to Russia.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T13:11:10,3
A ton of people? Like how many? And between what age?,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-08T13:55:11,1
"Russia has about 400k on the frontlines vs Ukraine presently at about 250k. Total military is like 1.3m Russian vs 800k Ukraine. Both are trying to draft like 250k people annually right now.   Ukraine still has something like 4m military aged males in the country who are not in the military. More are outside it because they left. Russia has about 25m military aged males.  Casualties for both sides are around 250-300k, more for Russia because they are attacking, with 3:1 injury to death ratio or something. A lot of the injuries are recoverable.   Ukraine has lost more civilians to the Russian bombing campaign on apartments and cities and such. Either way neither is doing total war here.  Most of what moves the needle is artillery, drone and missile supply.  Putin could draft a lot more Russians but it’s politically costly to do so and isn’t a leverage point as much as just having more stuff. That’s why they’ve focused so much on Iran and NK deals and also undermining western support for Ukraine via info ops.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T14:03:59,5

"Memory from reading and watching osint reports. ISW has good ones. It’s pro Ukraine, but cites everything. Perun is also excellent and very neutral in viewpoint. Western intel has released some estimates as well. Ask in the r/credibledefense daily digest if you want a summary someone will tell you.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-09T12:48:48,3
