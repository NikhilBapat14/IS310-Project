" Corporate, mainstream media can spare me this self-reflecting baloney.  We knew this would happen.  He's a fraud.  There are 34 felony convictions to prove it.    He's been found liable for sexual assault.  He incited an insurrection.  He should have been thrown in jail a long time ago but with the he said/she said media he has been normalized.  This is not normal.  If you are not speaking out as a journalist then you're just public relations for a wanna be dictator.",Kantsas,2025-04-28T07:51:18,39

Recall the current editor in chief for the NYT stated that he didn't think it was part of his job to defend democracy.  The guy who's supposed to be running a paper doesn't think *the fundamental freedom that makes his work possible shouldn't be defended*.  Then again - he's another nepo baby so I'm sure he thinks **he** should be harmed.,Federal_Drummer7105,2025-04-28T09:48:48,8
"The Bulwark has been forcefully calling this what it is from the get go. They've surged in popularity post election, but they've been on point.",moldivore,2025-04-28T10:06:06,5

The Bulwark has been one of the few that did offer unvarnished views on Trump. They ran numerous articles that forcefully called it.,moldivore,2025-04-28T10:08:02,6
"That sounds like the most lazy and pathetic thought terminating cliche possible. So the problem is that we are doing too good a job of warning you and you are still God damn ignoring us? You're still going to blame us for your own pathetic shit here?  Jesus fucking christ, grow a tiny God damn bit of personal accountability. I have seen people in kindergarten do a better job of acting like adults.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T07:59:04,8
