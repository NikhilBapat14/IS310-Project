"Hate to say it, but the fentanyl issue is a smokescreen. Mexican cartels can and will quickly learn to produce the precursor chemicals. US trade negotiators should focus on trade issues....mostly, reducing the size of the annual deficit with China AND China's intellectual property theft. Only problem is, the CCP will agree to things they have no intention of carrying out. This is the nature of the beast and anyone who doesn't believe so knows very little about either the ethics or the modus operandi of the Chinese Communists.  My hope is that Trump reaches trade deals with the rest of the world and freezes China out of US markets. Why should we continue assisting in the development of a country whose values and aspirations are antithetical to the interests of the USA (and - for that matter - the larger free world)?",Vessarionovich,2025-05-03T08:15:40,9

"Right? Considering the idea of not being a willing participant in the deaths of tens of thousands every year isn't something that should be favorably responded to.  That's like buying a new car, and the salesman trying to convince you to come up on your price by offering to not slash the tires.",the_house_from_up,2025-05-03T16:19:23,1
"I don't think the cartels will be able to produce precursors in the quantities that they get from China. China literally sends shipping containers full of metric tons of these chemicals. China also sends chemists to run the labs or teach cartel chemists how to make things. Some of these chemists are even US educated, which is insane.Â    It's an act of hostility and when should honestly be blacklisting the entire country and heavily scrutinizing any other country that does business with China. They're literally intentionally working with these cartels, now designated as terrorist organizations, in an effort to destabilize America.   How would we have felt about China if they were backing Al Qaeda or ISIS? How did we feel about China when they were backing Vietnam and North Korea?",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-03T10:42:54,8
