"What’s much more likely to happen:  - what if international tourism to America dropped by half this year?  - what if half of Europeans stopped buying US-made goods as a matter of principle, at any price point? - what if half the people in blue states stopped buying products made in red states to quietly say this is wrong?   A massive increase in unemployment caused by laying off millions of government employees will cause any local economy where it happens to go into a recession. To combine it with another self-made disaster to help America’s wealthy at any cost… it’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion.",Leather-Map-8138,2025-04-25T08:07:07,40
How do we stop paying taxes?  Most people have their taxes automatically collective via pay stubs and sales tax. Is someone going to hack the various payroll management systems to stop them from deducting income taxes?  Sales taxes are remitted once a month or once a quarter (depends on jurisdiction).  Side note: the US government doesn't run on taxes. It runs on borrowing and uses taxes to pay back part of the borrowing.,InFearn0,2025-04-25T10:59:22,5

"The people who pay the most taxes have it automatically ripped from their check by law by their employer, so they don’t have this choice.  The people that do have a choice (like 1099 labor, commissions, self employed) would all be guilty of tax evasion and get crushed by the IRS like they were dust.   This being said, there is an entire cash economy living within America that doesn’t pay taxes.  They even try to avoid paying sales tax by stealing items and reselling. That’s probably part of the reasoning behind the tariffs: get the tax money before this societal subset even has a chance to intervene.",PutContractMyLife,2025-04-25T04:17:01,15
">and/or all countries stopped trading with USA?  I'd more interested in this second proposal. When I saw the famous drawing showing Trump stamping his feet as he raised his tariffs on China while Xi sipped his cup of tea, I thought that all foreign heads of state should pretend he didn't exist and hadn't said anything, because he doesn't respect the rules of diplomacy by insulting everyone. But that's just a dream.  Stopping all trade with the US is what we'd like to do here in Europe, but we're a long way from getting there. However, public opinion is very hostile to Trump's America, and in principle that should translate into a drop. But many people here in France don't even know that Facebook or Amazon are American...",Francois-C,2025-04-25T04:54:53,3
"The government would print the money that it needs anyway, essentially imposing a regressive tax in the form of inflation. There is not, as far as I'm aware, any sort of market limit on the American government's ability to borrow. If there was a mass tax revolt, that might change, but it's hard to speculate about that in the short term. At some point, it would definitely lead to collapse. Lenders would lose confidence that they were going to be repaid, they would stop buying debt instruments, and something would have to give.",GiantPineapple,2025-04-25T06:35:41,2

"With respect to trade, removing the US from the world's system of trade would simply mean that there was no reason for the US to -permit- the world's system of trade. And unlike the few pariah countries which are largely prevented from trade, the US has the ability to cease to permit the trade of others; put differently, the advantage that the US Navy has in size, technology, and platforms is essentially decisive.  The other industrial countries of the West are wholly dependent on continued, regular oil shipments; none have any way of delivering those shipments in the face of a hostile United States. Before the US economy buckled under the weight of trade restrictions, the capitals of Europe would be festooned with their political leaders swinging from lampposts, put there by their own desperate citizens after the supermarkets emptied out from lack of transport fuel.  The US hasn't ever taken advantage of its naval ascendancy in that way. It's never had to, because the leaders of the other countries of the world usually don't get their jobs by being fools. It's not particularly hard to predict the consequences, and thus it -is- hard to find idiots willing to volunteer to try to organize such an effort; they're likely to get all of the downside without having enough other countries sign up to inconvenience the US in a measurable fashion.  Ironically, the two countries NOT really vulnerable to this kind of interdiction are Russia (produces oil for export on its own) and, well, the US itself these days. Imagine, we went from worries about ""Peak Oil"" to not needing to import the stuff at all, in a couple of decades...  It's worth mentioning Russia in context here, because they're the one (other) country that has the ability to export oil coupled with a nuclear arsenal. Russia would be in a position to deliver their black gold even in the face of US opposition. But if you're looking to protest US unfriendliness by trade restriction, surely substituting Russian oil would be significantly worse...",Avatar_exADV,2025-04-25T16:44:52,1
"I believe this is something Trump has spoke about, or atleast his fanboys seem to think he said it. If the entire country had no federal tax revenue, roads would cease to be repaired, schools would shut down, hospitals, airports, and bus routes would shut down. There would be an immediate recession as states have to fund all their peoples needs and we would likely see some states suceed from the United States. Countries like North Korea and Russia would cease the opportunity and take immediate control of the US or exterminate our civilization in mass.  In the Trump route I’ve heard about of just removing federal income taxes but keeping other taxes in place, all schools would have their funding halved or be shut down, hospitals, airports, and other publicly funded programs would have their funding halved. Next pressure for state funding would skyrocket causing state income tax to rise. This would cause a massive recession for states that were slow to the jump and didnt increase taxes causing massive turmoil across state lines. This would likely divide states into “living states” and “working states” where the rich move to “living states” where they pay little to no taxes while working class people end up paying even more in taxes than before in “working states”. Overall poverty rates and the wealth gap would increase while literacy rates decline.   Countries are currently already in the process of stopping trade with us. The main outcome currently is, the DOW is dropping, the cost of living is increasing, inflation is rising, industries are facing massive shortage problems, and technology is becoming more stagnant. If they completely stopped trade we would basically be identical to the inflation levels of Venezuela when they had their trade cut off. Basically our government would cease to operate in a functional way while our working people all enter poverty and starve to death. This is because the global markets would no longer use our currency for transactions which would tank its value, while our government is still spending more than its entire gdp in military spending causing hyperinflation. Cutting the military spending wouldnt help at this point either as any cut to spending would also be a cut to employment causing poverty and unemployment levels to rise only perpetuating the problem.  I could definitely go super in depth of the economics of this but I need sleep and think this way is easier to understand. I study economics so I tried to make that the focus more than anything. If you’d like to see what any of these scenarios looks like in history I’d recommend looking into both the gilded age and the beginning of the great depression. Both are filled with wealth inequality and horrible living conditions for working class people.",AceColombo,2025-04-26T06:34:10,1

"ok so here’s the deal... the u.s. prints its own money. like literally. it creates dollars out of thin air via the federal reserve and treasury coordination. so when people say “we need your taxes to fund the government,” that’s more narrative than necessity. the truth? taxes aren’t about funding... they’re about control.  they limit how much capital regular people can accumulate. they stop you from building real generational wealth unless you’re already inside the club. and more importantly, they enforce obedience. because once your house, your bank account, your wages are all tied to this system? they got you. they don’t need to lock you in a cage... they just lock you in paperwork.  if everyone stopped paying taxes? short-term, the system would panic. not because it can’t function... but because the illusion would break. people might realize that fiat currency isn’t real money. it’s social credit with better branding. and the whole thing only works if enough people keep pretending it’s legit.  as for trade? most countries depend on the dollar to even do trade. u.s. sanctions work because the dollar runs the global game. so cutting off america doesn’t just hurt america... it breaks the supply chains everyone else uses too. it’s mutual destruction, which is why nobody ever really does it.  bottom line... taxes are less about roads and schools and more about reminding you who’s boss. stop paying, and yeah, they’ll come for you. not because they need the money. but because they can’t let you realize they never did.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-25T10:11:57,1
"Trump's policies to help red states and not blue states makes me wonder if we should rethink how we pay taxes. Just spit balling here but; states collect all taxes who will then contribute federal taxes as determined by the state. Considering Federal programs are being cut to the states this would give each state funds that were once required from federal agencies. Secondly, each state pays there own representatives opposed the federal money. It may keep them more loyal to their constituents opposed to lobbyists.
