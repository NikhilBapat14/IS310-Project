"Very informative article from a source I consider reliable. See summary below:  • ""The U.S. gets the vast majority of common, generic medications from China, meaning President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs on Chinese imports could cause a shortage of key drugs. Generic drugs are affordable because of manufacturers’ razor-thin margins. Increased costs as a result of tariffs could disincentivize them from producing certain pain-relief meds.""",Nerd-19958,2025-04-30T17:06:56,36

"The World Trade Organization's Pharma Agreement eliminated tariffs and other charges on a large number of pharmaceuticals and ingredients.   It is simply improper and unethical to interfere with the practice of medicine and health care by restricting trade in and availability of medicines. Is that such a deep concept?   According to WTO, ""Canada, the European Union, Japan, Macao (China), Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States currently participate in this Agreement."" Of course, the USA's signature on an agreement prohibiting tariffs on pharmaceuticals means nothing to Trump.

"More but not outrageous, and you get big discounts for buying in bulk; a pack of 20 is about $5 and a bottle of 500 is maybe $10-20 depending on the brand   (£3.75, £13.50, £27)   Edit: these are corner drugstore prices, you can get it for cheaper from discount clubs. But you're probably picking up on the trend here, which is that the ibuprofen itself costs almost nothing and the amount you pay is basically a convenience fee.",pervocracy,2025-04-30T17:18:30,6

In the UK they are sold in smaller packets and there is a limit to the number of tablets one can buy from one shop. The reasoning behind this is that it makes it harder for people to buy enough in one go to overdose and kill themselves. Apparently the act of having to go to several different shops to buy larger quantities of the tablets does make people with suicidal tendencies think more about what they are doing and lessens the risk that they will carry through.,Yorks_Rider,2025-05-01T02:34:33,4
