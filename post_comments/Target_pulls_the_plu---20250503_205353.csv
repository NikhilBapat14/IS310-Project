I don't mind self check out if I have less than ten items.     I also don't mind a company pulling it because of theft.  Retail shrinkage is at an all the high.  ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-03T21:12:11,284
"More and more people think that shoplifting is okay because they think retail runs on massive margins. Nobody should be shocked that retail is making moves to minimize losses.  Walmart in my area has started employing people to check receipts like they do at Costco, and I live in a relatively well-off area. Which leads me to believe that it's not because people can't afford it, they are just trash humans.",the_house_from_up,2025-05-03T23:11:17,171
"Boy are they going to be surprised when the shoplifters continue to walk straight past the manned registers too...  Once they realized that certain states simply won't prosecute them for theft, it was game on.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-03T23:57:22,143

"Not all locations, just select ones.  >The retailer announced it will now limit self-checkout to customers with 10 items or fewer.   This should have always been the case.

I’m fine with phasing out self checkout. I’d rather have a store employ a human and pay them wages that the employee could then spend within their local economy.,snobrotha,2025-05-03T23:57:21,55

"So I believe the legality, for lack of better term, has been an issue in the past of NON membership stores like Walmart stopping people to check receipts.  They can ask, but you can tell the 85 yr old receipt checker to pound sand and keep on walking.    This is also not considering Loss Prevention has reason to legally stop you and check proof of purchase.",theycalllmeTIM,2025-05-04T06:56:19,35

We do the same. It saves a load of time too because we can load our “cart” over several hours before doing the checkout then go pickup when it’s convenient. 5 minutes at the store and we’re gone. No impulse buys either.,kenspi,2025-05-04T08:21:08,7

I remember before Walmart when the grocery checkers were professional and would ring up and bag everything super fast and not do things like put milk on top of bread.  They were way faster than I can do it myself.  Need professionalism back.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-04T02:08:45,44
"Yes. Because self checkout is an option, I feel that customers aren’t likely to complain and will chalk it up to the Store being busy. Once you remove self check out it becomes obvious that there’s a major staffing issue, customers will complain and then the store will have to address the issue. Self check out is a crutch that is allowing the stores to be understaffed.",snobrotha,2025-05-04T18:40:22,2
"There is a balancing act or breaking point... People will only tolerate lines for so long when there are alternatives.  Labor rates are always a supply and demand proposition. An hour of a person's labor is worth what a business and a person are willing to agree to. If the business is willing to give $7.25 for an hour of someone's labor and nobody is interested, then that rate will naturally rise as the businesses needs for manpower begin to outweigh their needs for budgetary constraints.  Personally, I would rather shop at a place that pays a person $25/hr to scan my groceries over a place that doesn't pay anyone to scan my groceries, but expects me to do so while constantly hovering over me and attempting to file criminal charges for an honest mistake as I'm not familiar with their system. This is why we do most of our grocery shopping at Aldi.  I also don't show my receipt at WalMart on the odd occasion that I wind up in that store.",Paramedickhead,2025-05-04T12:48:25,7
Degradation of morals. Somewhere I read a study that found the majority of shoplifters have enough money on them to pay for the item they were attempting to steal.   I suspect the Internet has also made it easier to fence stolen goods.,Willow-girl,2025-05-04T13:17:53,33

"This is mainly why I stopped doing my grocery shopping at Kroger. The employees there always seem like they’re miserable and it shows in their professionalism. The cashiers hardly ever say “hello” or “have a nice day” to the customer or acknowledge them at all during the transaction, and in the off chance there’s actually a bagger at the end of the checkout lane, the cashier and the bagger complain to each other the whole time about their boss / schedules / coworkers in front of the customer. But for some reason, only about 20% of the open checkout lanes even *have* baggers, so most of the time the customer has to bag their own groceries. Just awful customer service.",margacolada,2025-05-04T08:27:43,3
