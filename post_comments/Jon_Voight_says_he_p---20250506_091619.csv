The Hollywood tariff plan might be the dumbest one yet. Who's importing films? Where are they going to apply the tariff - at the port where the film is brought into the country?  And the whole plan is to make sure America makes films in America again. Like Hollywood isn't churning out thousands of film/tv projects a year.

"so basically if everything ive seen about this is true, the issue is that enough production of movies happens outside the united states, filming locations etc.  which brings money from the US to foreign countries, rather than to US locations.  therefore losing money for US cities that could alternatively be used as on site locations.  ignoring completely that foreign investors pay into movie studios to have scenes done in their cities.  that it can help drive ticket sales in foreign markets. and thus help movies reach higher sales.  this also then ignores that any other country might have a domestically produced movie that somehow competes with american movies for ticket sales.    If these people want ticket sales to increase, there is one sure-fire way to do it.  stop greedy actors/studios.  im sorry, but most of you dont need or deserve 20-50 million in pay.  make every actor/actress get a % of revenue as their pay.  direct incentive to making good movies.  then make studios and such the same.  the only outlier to this being the staff on production.  next step, bring movie ticket prices(and concessions) down.  in a good economy nobody wants to pay to bring their 2 adult 2 kids family to a movie spending $60-80 on tickets and another $40 on popcorn and sodas.  this is completely unrealistic.  now make the economy slip and you still ask for that?  make tickets go back to $10 for adults less for kids, and something reasonable for concessions, and watch people come back to theaters.",VOIDsama,2025-05-06T09:37:09,7

"you cant just say ok, we want alien world so use nevada for everything.  or we want the streets of paris so you what street in the usa mimics this.  all you end up doing is getting a basic set piece, more green screen use and lots more cgi. and this wont always save money.  pretty much every movie studio anywhere knows that you get a better effect with practical effects and real world locations.  as for costs, that depends on how much you need to do somewhere else and what impact on locals it has.  shut down the plaza for 3 days and you have big disruption.  setup for a hundred extras to do a roman age battle scene in a desert and your costs are completely different.  at the same time, many studios also get incentives or investment from foreign cities to have parts of their movies there.  the transformers movie that takes place in part in hong kong and china was like this.  the Chinese love the movies so a major movie theater chain invested in the movie with the requirement that there be scenes on location they wanted, then premiers at their theaters.  so the studio cuts costs by taking foreign investment, while also reaching a much wider audience.  Iron man 2 had this to a smaller degree with a, very much so terrible, extra scene at the end involving chinese doctors and a famous actress removing the metal from tonys chest saving his life.   this was only in the chinese version of the movie, but does it now mean the whole movie is tariffed?  this doesnt benefit anyone here.   without these deals the movies audience could be much smaller which means much less revenue.  the benefit from a global audience is often much greater than what the studio would ""save"" via domestic production.    Further, what of foreign made film?  is bollywood threatening american studios profits?  are anime films that disney licenses and releases amid their own movie releases?  what of the french art house movie?",VOIDsama,2025-05-07T08:38:56,1
