There are millions and millions of veterans and active service in this country. He thinks we need to see a fucking parade to know what we got?

"Replusive. It would be Replusive under any circumstances, but after taking people's jobs away, ruining the economy with tariffs and other selfish decisions, among other negatives he has brought to the US, it is beyond replusive.

Didnt that one specific thing (suckers and losrrs comment) get debunked ( a rarity I know)?  *edit for all the toxicity. I am a us veteran and independant voter. Not a maga supporter.

"Nope. Trumps disdain for servicemen and women is well documented and simply ignored by those who want to believe he cares for this country.  If you went into the military in his eyes its only because you were too stupid for thinking it was worth doing, or too poor (and therefore stupid) to do anything else. He thinks he did the smart thing and got a bogus doctor‚Äôs note saying he had bone spurs to avoid the draft.  Now he likes the POMP of a military parade; Putin gets them, Kim gets them, so HE should get them. Because they‚Äôre his toys, his tin soldiers, and when his toys break he throws them away.",PloddingAboot,2025-05-05T07:46:04,8
