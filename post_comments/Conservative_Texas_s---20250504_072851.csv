"Barring maga-cult people, even if we can't fix systemic issues overnight, at least recognizing and acknowledging them helps to build solidarity and support between each other moreso than going holier-than-thou with it does",blackhatrat,2025-05-04T09:12:18,14
"Until about three years ago, my employers made it nigh on impossible to vote. Maybe get off your high horse.",Moon_Noodle,2025-05-04T20:12:24,0
>I blame the people for not being engaged because that is where the blame goes in a democracy.  You spent 3 decades volunteering and have no understanding of democracy?  On mass population levels individual blame is useless as a strategy.  Do you want to blame people or figure out how to change it?  What does blaming achieve? What's your praxis? You spent decades immersed in this and have no analysis of the systems and media and propaganda and culture behind this?,monsantobreath,2025-05-04T21:47:52,3

"> The Center for Election Innovation and Research noted that in 2000, just 40% of voters had access to early voting, either in person or by mail. Now, 97% have at least one option to vote before Election Day. > >""What our research shows is that for almost all voters in the United States, it's easier to vote than ever. Almost all voters can vote early at a time and place of their choosing, and the vast majority can vote by mail if they prefer,"" said David Becker, the executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research. Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, added, ""This means the 2024 election will be as secure and convenient for voters as any election in our history.""  I repeat:  > There’s always an excuse not to take a tiny sliver of time out of your day to vote and instead doom scroll social media.",CanEnvironmental4252,2025-05-05T05:29:30,0
"So what's your answer, let me guess you're waiting for people to be inspired. Or you think we need a candidate that can inspire them.    That worked so well in 2016 didn't it.    The fact is that voting is a responsibility and people in America don't care about voting because they don't see how government affects their day-to-day lives. Go out in the trenches and then come back and talk to me.",Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-05T04:05:01,0
"Ok I see that. Dallas isn’t irrelevant on the whole to this topic though. I wasn’t saying any part of Texas is blue, just that urban areas, Dallas county, Tarrant and extending further and further are getting more liberal vs the rest of Texas. I think it just applies to most urban areas where people of different backgrounds are more often in contact which leads to more tolerance in order to coexist. And as the populace of America continues to urbanize, those areas will start to look more liberal in their elections",ndndr1,2025-05-05T17:12:38,1
