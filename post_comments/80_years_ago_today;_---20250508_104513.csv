"If you have already watched the ten-episode series, today would be a great day to watch BAND OF BROTHERS. It's the true story of the men of the Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division.  It might very well be the best series ever made -- about some of the greatest heroes of WW2.",chrismireya,2025-05-08T10:48:34,7
