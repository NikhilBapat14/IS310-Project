"We had a 10 month bear market in 2022, I don’t remember as much astroturfing about that one.   As we sit today , the SP500 is down 4.5% on the year. Keep in mind that entering this year, the USD, SP500 Nasdaq, were all very stretched in valuation. The USD specifically literally could not go any higher ( very top of trading range for the last 20 years ). Valuations matter, but you never know exactly WHEN they will really start to matter.",jcr2022,2025-05-02T07:55:24,133

Reddit is desperate for bad news. All of the investing subs are in pure cope mode praying for more crashes.   A lot of them sold everything based on reddit sentiment and are now clinging to anything that says the market will crash to justify their idiotic decisions.,xxPOOTYxx,2025-05-02T09:54:14,51

"> they've lost their entire 401k  Yeah, people like this are being dramatic.  If they're not lying, they just started investing in February, or made some really bad decisions  > If you have actually lost a major amount in this period ( I doubt it), I can't help but think you have yourself to blame there  Most importantly, if you still have your money in stocks and you are within a few years of retirement, you screwed up  > the S&P 500 is up about 11% year over year  > A lot of run-up in the market was a direct result of Trump was going to get elected/got elected.  If you look at the YTD, it is down about 5%  It falling means that his actual policies are different than what people expected.  They wanted deregulation, but they taxes and volatility  The value market doesn't necessarily mean anything good or bad.  We have likely been in a bubble for years now, so it is hard to truly gauge what is real and what is hype and inflation driven  > please remember the stock market is forward looking  Yes, it falling since the start of the ""tariff war"" is an indicator that investors aren't thrilled with the immediate future of the economy based on Trump's actual policies",you_cant_prove_that,2025-05-02T08:35:33,38

"Biden: inflation at 20%, 3 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth (2 quarters = definition of “recession”), stock market down 29% (down 30% = definition of “crash”)  “there is no stagflation”  Trump: stock market down 9% (not even the definition of a “correction,” which is 10%)  “ECONOMIC COLLAPSE”  Question: do you really even care about their histrionics anymore?

It’s honestly so silly omg the economy is crashing when it’s actually up from this same time last year. People talking about how they can’t retire and I’m like did you just start investing last year lol. There was never any dips during Biden right?,Graardors-Dad,2025-05-02T08:08:00,0

"> the SP500 is down 4.5% on the year  It was down closer to 10% and it has recovered.  It was an unforced error due to a complete lack of effective communication on tariffs. There *still* isn't clear messaging on tariffs. Are they temporary until deals are done, or are they going to pay so much we'll end the income tax?  Look I get China. Tariff the *hell* of them -at least until they join the community of honest brokers.    I also get that there needs a reset to make sure tariffs are low/eliminated by our trading partners on our exports, but this is where the comms are muddy.  Whenever there is uncertainty, the markets will respond negatively.  That said, I've personally been shoving every penny I can in.  I'm a long term investor and things are on sale.",Kahnspiracy,2025-05-02T16:19:56,5
You also have to consider inflation when looking at the market under democrats. Prices went up not because of real value but because each dollar is worth a lot less than it used to be.,day25,2025-05-02T13:31:50,5

The DJIA is down about 2% from a year ago.   That's after double digit gains the 2 prior years.   Nobody has lost time or value unless they had incredibly poor planning on timing entry and exit from the market the past month.,Silly-Safe959,2025-05-02T09:47:01,9
