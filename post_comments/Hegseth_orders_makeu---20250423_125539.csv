This particular breed of spackle comes in eight colors - five that are basically flesh-toned, plus orange, green and light purple. For what’s wrong with his face, orange is the right color to use. When this was revealed, Bronx Colors almost immediately ran out of it because, for some reason, tons of people ordered it online. Most people don’t need this.  What you’re SUPPOSED to do with it is cover the imperfections AND JUST THE IMPERFECTIONS with a light coat of color-correcting concealer, wait till it dries, cover the color corrector with a skintone-shade concealer, wait till that dries, then use skintone-shade foundation and setting powder over your entire face.  What you are not supposed to do is cover your entire face with a thick layer of color corrector and go out in public that way, but it’s what Trump does.

" Pete Hegseth is an alcoholic.  It is an illness so I’m not deriding him for that.  I’m just so astounded the Senators who consented to him, the President who appointed him and the maga base that do not care how he runs the defense department, do not grasp the basics of this disease.  One does not just, cold turkey, ‘quit drinking’.  And even if you do, you remain an alcoholic, with behavior patterns and alcoholic thinking. For the remainder of your life.  Therefore his travails are not surprising.  In fact they are entirely predictable.    Now how to get MAGA devotees to understand this, and how to get Republicans congressional delegates to take action is an entirely different kettle of worms, perhaps a tougher question than treating an alcoholic.  They are lost in blind allegiance to a charismatic cult leader.    Both can be extremely difficult to admit to, understand, and address.  That’s the long game.

The secret of defense *should* look healthy on TV.  They put it in the green room already used to prepare for press conferences, and a few thousand is what I would expect to pay if I wanted to install a vaguely professional tv makeup studio in my spare room.  All in all it's a reasonable change for a reasonable amount of money, it just sounds scandalous that the Pentagon has a makeup room.

"From a paper discussing the Kennedy-Nixon debates in 1960:  > Along with the role of television, the desire for a candidate to look as good as they speak became more relevant. [...] Nixon showed up wearing little makeup and a light grey suit, which blended into the background. He was constantly wiping sweat off his face and according to the audience looked exhausted and pale.  [Source](https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/history/debate/kennedynixon/kennedynixonscholarly.html)  It's genuinely important because perception influences how you think about a person, and how receptive you are to their ideas.  Not to mention a few grand is what the Pentagon loses in the couch cushions, it's hardly worth talking about. Last administration the head of the [EPA spent $43,000 on a soundproof booth](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/16/politics/pruitt-soundproof-booth/index.html) and [doggie is paying a host of college dropouts 6 figure salaries to destroy our tech infrastructure](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-government-salaries-elon-musk/). It's such a weird thing to hone in on when it's a pretty reasonable addition to a green room where people get ready to appear on national television.  Now if it was in his office and someone was doing his makeup every day regardless, that's insane. Hell, if he pops down to the green room for makeup every day that's insane. For setting up people who need to be on camera it's pretty sensible.  That and there's plenty to criticize Pete for, finally recognizing that the Pentagon runs a small tv studio which needs to be outfitted accordingly isn't one of them.",ender89,2025-04-23T15:54:34,0
"On the first point, getting someone from facilities to install a mirror and some lights doesn't require a lot of actual work from hegseth. It's not taking people off leaking airstrikes to the news or keeping his mom's fridge up to date with all the classified documents he's signed, it was probably an offhanded remark to an aid who made a call to facilities.  Hell, the article even mentions that they went out of their way to use what was on hand when they could (though that obviously could be a lie).  The competency is the only interesting thing here. Everything else he's done has been so hamfisted I wouldn't be surprised to find out he's actually 3 kids in a trenchcoat. This is a pretty sensible thing to add to the pressroom, and it draws a stark contrast to all the incompetent things he's done.  It really makes him look unqualified for his job when the only smart thing he's done doesn't involve the military in any way.",ender89,2025-04-23T16:33:53,-1

"I can't say you make bad points, because you make good ones and I don't dispute that you've always had a point. I think it's something to criticize because it's Pete Hegseth making it happen, so not only should we question the motive, but also the reasoning.     If it was a competent person at the very least, and someone who took the job seriously and had an actual outlook that looked like they'd be in the job for more than a few months, yeah I'd be more agreeable. ",ineyeseekay,2025-04-23T16:11:23,3
"In isolation, I agree a minor thing like this doesn't say much about his priorities but it dovetails too well with the fact that Hegseth's main job right now is running from camera to camera doing damage control for his personal fuckups and that he is only qualified to be a TV pundit",WidespreadPaneth,2025-04-23T16:48:29,3

"The article says ""a few thousand dollars"", which sounds about right for a project like this. I doubt I could find a contractor to do it cheaper.  It's a pretty reasonable idea pretty reasonably executed, and acting like the order itself is outlandish kind of takes away from everything else that he fucks up.  If news articles get written every time someone in the trump administration does anything beyond keeping the status quo, it lessens the impact of actions that are actually outrageous. This does not belong in the news cycle next to signal gate 2.0  And you just *know* he's going to point to the overreaction over a functional low-cost improvement to the press room as ""leftists"" blowing everything out of proportion.
