Even Bigfoot’s endorsing Trump—through encrypted QAnon smoke signals.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-06T08:06:09,7
Uneducated people believe stupidities.   I followed Qanon closely to see when ppl would wake up.   The ones that did were ousted from the circle as soon as they pointed out nothing was happening.   The ones who are left are convinced everyone agrees with them. Because they erase the voices of people who don't.,Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-05-06T08:21:34,5
"The Republican Party has gone from the Southern Strategy which riled up people with stories about members of marginalized communities marrying your daughters   to Trump Won the 2020 Election to Demons are Real.   >A lot of people in authority know that this rhetoric is powerful — it is a way to stoke uncertainty and then say, ‘Hey, if you listen to me, I can help you with your uncertainty and make sure that you and your group are going to be OK,’” Dr. Wang said. “That’s really comforting.”  >Politicians understand that conspiracy theories are “what scratches our collective psychic itch” at the moment, said John Llewellyn, an associate professor of communication at Wake Forest University who studies urban legends and rhetoric. Repeating such narratives, and promising to act on them, enables a sort of rhetorical sleight of hand, like performing a card trick with the right hand to misdirect from what is happening with the left, he said.  >Pursuing policy action on nonexistent dangers of chemtrails, for example, allows officials to deliver “symbolic satisfaction that doesn’t require any tax increases or wrestling with health care challenges or otherwise solve any of the real and emergent problems in our society,” Mr. Llewellyn said.  >The wild narratives are causing real-world trouble. ...  >The correlation between support for political violence and the tendency to classify events and circumstances as results of conspiracies tripled in magnitude from 2012 to 2022, according to an essay published in December by several researchers, including Dr. Uscinski of the University of Miami.   >A feedback loop of conspiracy theories has formed at every level of American government, according to watchdog groups. Efforts to break the chain are weakening: Misinformation and disinformation researchers have faced years of political pressure, including a decision by the National Science Foundation last month to terminate grants related to research in the field.  ...  >What other topics are going from shunned to the spotlight? Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, a left-wing advocacy group that monitors misinformation, said he was “pretty bullish on demons as the next big one.”  >Mr. Trump referred to “demonic forces” on the campaign trail and called Democrats a “very demonic party.” Days before interviewing both Donald Trump Jr. and Mr. Musk at Mar-a-Lago on Election Day, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, posted a YouTube video claiming he had been attacked in the night “by a demon or by something unseen.” Dan Bongino, a right-wing pundit and podcaster who is now the deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said on his show that “demon energy is real",SicilyMalta,2025-05-06T08:06:56,5
"Marjorie Taylor Green and her Jewish Space Lasers, Musk and Trump insisting gold was stolen from Fort Knox , RFK taking money away from cancer research to study chem trails....  >“If some guy, somewhere, thinks the Earth is flat, the answer is ‘So what?’ But when people in power have those beliefs, it becomes a serious issue.”...  >Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the White House, said in a statement that the mainstream media “has tried and failed to paint President Trump as extreme for his entire political career” and that his agenda was “common sense.”  >Debunked narratives about election fraud and vaccines have proliferated in national discourse over the past five years. A pro-Trump movement known as QAnon, which makes outlandish claims that there is a global sex-trafficking operation backed by the so-called deep state, was found at one point to be as popular in the United States as some major religions.  >But the conspiracy theories now graduating into the mainstream were, until recently, far more marginal. And the people voicing them are growing more influential.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-06T08:16:48,2
"Okay so what if this conspiracy talk is to hide one of their own conspiracies. Is this just a conspiracy about conspiracies? Maybe, but they do project a lot.

"It’s honestly mind-boggling how some people cling to those ridiculous theories. Like, really? Stolen elections? That’s some basement-dwelling conspiracy nonsense. The GOP has become a haven for delusion, and it’s depressing to see so many buy into it. People need to wake up and see the damage this kind of thinking does. We're better than this, folks. Let’s focus on real issues, not fantasy lands!",Otherwise_Dot4091,2025-05-06T08:34:43,1
