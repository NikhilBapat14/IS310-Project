"If you want a machine it usually comes from China, Germany, Japan or the US.   If you want a very high precision machine it usually comes from Japan or Germany.  If you want parts for any of them... its probably coming from China, unless its hyper specific to the machine.",toxic_badgers,2025-05-02T08:58:59,8

Crushing American manufacturing one tariff at a time.,FlyingRock,2025-05-02T09:11:14,3
"*From Bloomberg News reporters Shawn Donnan, Mark Niquette, and Enda Curran:*  Almost as swiftly as he has erected his tariff wall around the US over the past 100 days, President Donald Trump has issued exemptions for a select but growing family of products like auto parts and smartphones.  One group of companies, though, is engaged in an increasingly urgent waiting game: Those looking to import the machinery from China they say they need to set up or expand their US manufacturing facilities — precisely the production boost that Trump has billed as the ultimate goal of his tariffs.  In recent months, more than 180 companies have filed more than 1,100 individual requests for exclusions, pleading their case for Chinese-made machinery to achieve their domestic industrial ambitions.  The calls come amid broader anger over tariffs and surveys showing manufacturers are already starting to rein in production as a result of the tariffs and uncertainty surrounding them. A report Thursday showed factory activity shrank in April by the most in five months, posting the steepest contraction in output since 2020.

I’m sure Trump will expect something in return for his granting exclusions.  Most corrupt administration of all time.,KidKilobyte,2025-05-02T08:59:45,2
Surely a new American factory will pop right up and make that machinery instead.,30mil,2025-05-02T09:06:53,2

"> If you want a machine it usually comes from China, Germany, Japan or the US. If you want a very high precision machine it usually comes from Japan or Germany.  I guess  Vance was right. Can't expect Chinese peasants to be able to make very high precision machines.",xibeno9261,2025-05-02T09:00:52,-4
An export tax. China needs to reward trump for these exceptions with an equal export tax.,Gibbons74,2025-05-02T09:28:41,1
"First we need to manufacture the sewing machines.  Or, wait, we may need to start with bearings and precision fasteners.  I sure hope we have the extra steel manufacturing in place so we can make the parts to make the machines that make the clothes we need.  Hopefully before I run out of clothes.",DeliberatelyDrifting,2025-05-02T10:04:49,3
