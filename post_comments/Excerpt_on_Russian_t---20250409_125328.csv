"Trump isn't mentioned even once on that page, so obviously he couldn't have read it.  It's a fun coincidence, but Trump isn't a guy who thinks or plans. He's emotional and capricious. If he un-pauses his tariffs, it'll be because he felt like it. Maybe inadequate adulation will make him feel like it. Maybe a Big Mac before breakfast will make him feel like it. It'll be something stupid rather than thought out.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-09T20:35:04,7
