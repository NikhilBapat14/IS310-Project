Oh wow we can't use war powers when we're not a war with a country....such a mind blowing decision. ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-05-01T12:35:54,145
"That's nice, now stop him.",Great_Ad4198,2025-05-01T12:33:41,59
and he will just say that isn't what his lawyers told him and ignore the courts.,zombiereign,2025-05-01T12:44:10,19
Are the courts even still a thing anymore?,Normal_Attitude_5148,2025-05-01T13:14:42,19
I bet he’s going to stop right… right?,UncIe_John,2025-05-01T15:05:18,4
Cool. What about that part where he doesn’t listen to the courts? Then what are you gonna do?,FourYearsBetter,2025-05-01T13:12:19,10
Eh I’ll take any win we get,Duke-of-Dogs,2025-05-01T13:27:57,6
Makes sense in that only congress can declare war. If anyone read and defended that thing called the constitution they would know that.,metal0060,2025-05-01T14:57:31,3
"yeah he’ll definitely stop the third time he’s told to, that’ll show him!",molecularraisin,2025-05-01T17:23:29,1
"Let me guess, Trumps gona declare war on Norfolk Island so he can say the US is now at war and continue to deport people.",binary101,2025-05-01T18:59:56,1
He’ll just have his goons arrest the judges.,Haunting_Tax8020,2025-05-01T19:04:11,1
You all know what this means—get ready for the draft!,inequalequal,2025-05-01T20:55:25,1
"Because, you know, while our economy is stuttering it's not a full-blown emergency.",justconnect,2025-05-01T12:40:35,-1
inb4 he starts a war to deport people,mcshiffleface,2025-05-01T14:22:50,33
That’s the real news with this. He really wants to claim immigration is an invasion and blue states are insurrections because we’re abetting it so he can invoke some wartime powers internally. The judge said there is no invasion.,drmike0099,2025-05-01T17:04:05,10
He’ll be conviently arrested for talking to a MS13 gang member or some other bullshit,DingusMcWienerson,2025-05-01T22:23:30,0
Right? At this point I feel like the only thing that'll stop Trump is death by natural causes,Awkward_Swordfish581,2025-05-01T14:39:25,11
"Well they are, unless you’re a Republican politician.. or a Republican political donor, oh, or you commit egregious immoral acts and a Republican.. or simply have enough money. So yes, for everyone but those people, they’re a thing.  You and I, for example, don’t get to just commit high crimes and misdemeanours, and then walk out the courtroom and immediately continue on with life after being found guilty.",L0rd_OverKill,2025-05-01T16:55:26,2
Not a win if there's no enforcement behind the decision.,Lazerdude,2025-05-01T15:33:32,-1
Kinda explains why he's been aggressive to our allies...,vicvonqueso,2025-05-01T14:28:54,14
don't give him ideas,Ok_Map9434,2025-05-01T15:18:17,7
Judges hate this one simple trick.,throwawaypostal2021,2025-05-01T19:27:46,2
His not having the whole of the judiciary under his thumb is a *massive* win and pretending otherwise isn’t helpful,Duke-of-Dogs,2025-05-01T15:49:57,9
