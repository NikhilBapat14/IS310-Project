Copy paste, check for wording and do it again, again and again. Whole day, forever. The boss was incompetent, we were a team of foreigners and the boss couldn't speak basic english. Our computers had a system that tracked your activity. If it was too low, too many breaks etc. you would have a talk with your boss. Every task was timed as well, not just general activity.  Besides that, coworkers were nice and it wasn't the end of the world, just not pleasant. I imagine if the job was more fun(not doing copy paste translation the whole day) i would possibly stay there longer.  Edit: it does depend on the department though.

Overall it will decrease consumption.   The problem is that it will hurt lower income folks more because of a disproportionate effect on lower cost goods and because lower income folks don’t have the financial cushion to shoulder a price increase. Also for lower income folks there isn’t really an option to substitute goods since they are already getting the cheapest goods.   The bigger issue isn’t the decreased consumption which ultimately is good for the environment, but the blunt way in which this is implemented which neither promotes more environmentally sustainable living nor takes into account keeping lower income Americans solvents, nor has a model for environmentally sustainable economic growth.",Quietabandon,2025-05-04T06:00:43,-1

"Heartwarming story, hope it’s true and you’re not just making it up because that would be disgusting.   But let’s get real, the vast majority of Temu purchases aren’t bulk electronics for charitable causes. Instead it’s low quality polyester clothing, cosmetics and knock off electronics.   You might think “China has mastered manufacturing,” but it’s more accurate to say they’ve mastered leveraging lax labor standards, environmental neglect, trade imbalances, population control, and strategic overproduction to dominate global markets.  The US has finally decided to push back against imports built on exploitation—sacrificing short-term convenience to confront a system that undermines its own industries, workers, and long-term national security.",crows-milk,2025-05-04T09:33:27,1

"Look at rare earth metals. The amount dug out from China is by far greater than any other country. It is double over the 2nd highest producer (Brazil) and over 5 times greater than the 3rd highest producer (India). It is over 22 times what can be produced in the U.S. it isn’t about dependence, it is about resource locations.  Or from the U.S. perspective, over 80% of all almonds produced in the world are produced in the U.S. because the climate (specifically California) is the best for growing almonds.  In addition, even if it was about being economically independent. The price of all goods will increase. Even if you diversify and buy from other countries, or build factories in the US and buy from here (which would take years to do in the first place). The cost of goods will rise, simply because of the cost to produce in those other countries will be greater than it currently is. That doesn’t even include the tariffs we are imposing even on those other countries.  There is a reason why tariffs made the Great Depression worse (by making everything more expensive during a recession). There is a reason why mercantilism, which is the economic policy of having trade surpluses controlled through high tariffs, lead to mass colonialism (because you can’t make everything in your own country). Blanket tariffs are bad economic policies, period.",alienbringer,2025-05-04T06:32:14,2

"I'm not white washing anything. If you don't understand the concept of reducing losses or harm then you are simply unfit to participate in electoral politics. The candidacy wasn't under my control, nor yours. He was genocide joe, sure, and I would still vote for him over abstaining or a vote for Trump, fully, unlike you, having real affected family members (how do I know for a fact you aren't affected by this? Because you're incapable of understanding how those people's lives are worse under Trump than they were under Biden.)  Do you seriously not see a difference between Trump Gaza and the ongoing genocide? Do you not see a difference between the US falling to fascism or not? The US is falling into fascism in a way it hasn't in its history. That would've been different under Biden/Harris. That is a simple fact. You're not clever or exceptionally moral for recognizing that democrats do awful things, but you are exceptionally incapable of nuance or adult decision making if you don't understand the difference between the candidates.  I'm not further engaging if you're going to be this disingenuous. I hope you appreciate the consequences of the Trump win.

"It's the internet, you never know what's real, lol. But the ride-on car thing is definitely something I started doing last year. I roam around on trash day or snag free/cheap ones on Facebook Marketplace to fix up and modify them for a kids individual needs. I’ve finally been able to make like modular attachments for them so they can play nerf guns or laser tag with other kids. Honestly, learning how to do it and then watching the kids zoom around on these bad boys has been incredibly rewarding.  I’m skeptical that it's really about “pushing back on countries taking advantage of us.” Especially when, at the same time, it feels like unions are being weakened and child labor laws relaxed just to fill jobs that maybe weren't desirable in the first place. If the goal was truly to bring manufacturing back strong, why undermine workers' rights? It feels counterproductive, almost like a punishment.  I can't disagree with you about Temu, a lot of it seems to be low quality stuff that breaks quickly. You’re not wrong, China is basically using what amounts to slave labor. But they also have the factories, machinery, and logistics to make almost everything we use. I'm definitely not arguing against bringing critical manufacturing back to the US, especially for things like computer chips and electronics. We can't rely on another country for those, especially of another war pops off. We'd be crippled.  My issue is with how it's being handled. It feels more like a political pissing match than a serious strategy. I think most people, regardless of politics, probably agree on the goal of strengthening US manufacturing, but everything gets so politicized. People seem more interested in attacking the “other side” than actually sitting down and figuring out the best way forward.",oldassveteran,2025-05-04T10:31:47,1

Don't forget to throw some blame at the Dems. They have a firm commitment to making the worst decision possible at every turn. It would help voter apathy quite a lot if the Dems gave people something to be excited about. There's a lot of systems in place making sure nobody popular can take the place of any good ol' establishment Dem.

Here’s my (slightly conspiratorial) take: Trump is the fall guy. He’s pulling the trigger on moves both parties know are necessary but are too cowardly to make themselves because it would destroy them politically. Not to mention diplomatically towards allies and neutrals alike.  What better way to disrupt the global order than to let a bombastic celebrity bulldoze through it? Then the next administration can quietly keep the shift going while pretending their hands are clean.  It already happened after Biden kept Trump’s China tariffs in place.,crows-milk,2025-05-04T12:15:52,1
> It would help voter apathy quite a lot if the Dems gave people something to be excited about.  The voters are there. All Democrats have to do is give them a reason to vote. Covid motivated people to vote Biden. There wasn't much motivation to vote Hillary or Kamala.   People blame the non-voters every time. They never blame the people in charge. Doesn't make sense to me. It's all land of the free until vote time rolls around then people get angry because other people don't do what they are told. Bizarre.,tech57,2025-05-04T04:58:32,1

"""I'm not incapable of nuance"" proceeds to completely nuke any veneer of critical thinking or nuance. You're proving every aspect of my point.
