"Exactly, Bufffet's always been pretty consistent about that, he sees trade as a win win thing, not something to mess with for short term points tariffs usually just end up costing regular people more anyway",HugsCatcher,2025-05-03T12:42:09,6
"The long term outlook for the US with these trade wars will only serve to drive trade elsewhere. Nations will just make new reliable trading partners. It may take awhile but it will happen. If the goal was to increase manufacturing in the US the reality is people can't work or for that matter compete with low wages in China and even if they raised the price imagine people paying for made in US shoes that were once $100.oo in China and now cost $400.oo... who's going to want to buy them. Seriously, this 1900's dream of some old demented president is so flawed on so many levels.",Thund3rbolt,2025-05-03T12:42:24,2
Actually you should use tariffs as a weapon if you intend to use to against Americans. Trump intends to destroy America as vengeance for the 2020 election loss; prove me wrong.,TheCommonGround1,2025-05-03T13:16:55,2

"I agree, China has been using it as a weapon. Time to call them out. Of course Buffett is too weak to say that, but itâ€™s China who has had unfair trade practices, not the U.S. educate yourself people!",Next-Transportation7,2025-05-03T17:12:57,0
