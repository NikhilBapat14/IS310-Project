"- to be honest, Illinois State govt ran really well under Ryan vs what happened with Blago and Rauner...both pure disasters....",decaturbob,2025-05-03T05:23:19,5
"Former Illinois Governor George Ryan passed away on May 2, 2025, at the age of 91 in Kankakee, Illinois, while under hospice care. A Republican known for his pragmatism, Ryan served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He gained international recognition for halting executions and commuting all death row sentences in Illinois, citing systemic injustices in the capital punishment system. However, his career was marred by a corruption scandal dating back to his tenure as secretary of state, leading to a 2006 conviction for racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. He served over five years in federal prison and was released in 2013.",Drtardis95,2025-05-03T04:41:09,1
