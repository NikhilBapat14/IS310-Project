I'm not sure I understand how Google is under any legal obligation to label the gulf as Gulf of America or Gulf of Mexico. As far as I can discern they should be within their rights to label it the Gulf of Google if they want.,DartTheDragoon,2025-05-09T15:10:59,28

"Google only labeled it ""Gulf of America"" when viewed from the US. Unless something changed, it's called ""Gulf of Mexico"" when viewed from devices anywhere else, including Mexico.   Checked article, and nope, nothing changed. I highly doubt there is any legal precedent that can be used for mexico to sue based on what people in the US see on Google. As dumb as the entire thing is, this lawsuit is equally dumb.

"They are more than likely just using geolocation to please the US federal government. they don't have any obligation to provide accuracy, but they usually conform to some international standards when it comes to international waters.

Sure and then what happens next week when Trump tells us to change the google map borders and call Mexico: Trump Country?   Maps and drawing borders on these maps are a big fucking deal and can create wars,iStayedAtaHolidayInn,2025-05-09T18:21:54,3

"You really don't think this guy doesn't have better things to do than throw hissy fits over labeling bodies of water? Have some perspective.

"Exaggerating a bit here, but by that logic, what‚Äôs stopping Mexico from changing United States of America on their end to United States of Nazis or North Mexico?  And if they do, you would bet that all the MAGAs would be up and arms complaining",Fubi-FF,2025-05-09T18:23:32,3

"They could. But there is a substantial difference between a shared body of water and a land controlled by a sovereign government. The Gulf does not have a name that is determined by a sovereign body, as there is none. The Gulf of Mexico name is used by various international bodies, but none of them has truly control on it, they just come to an agreement to a name to use to refer to it, usually the most commonly agreed by countries, especially the closest to the feature.   Renaming the USA as you suggest, on the other hand, is a clear act that is refusing to accept the naming that the body that governs that land as decided. I think most would agree that it much more offensive.",iesterdai,2025-05-09T20:19:02,2

So you‚Äôre saying it won‚Äôt be a big deal or an act of war if Trump declares Canada and Greenland as part of the US and then google changes the name officially in their maps?  Prediction? He literally changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico,iStayedAtaHolidayInn,2025-05-09T18:51:05,2

"Right, but we are strictly talking about legality here since the topic of this thread is about the lawsuit.  So by the same argument that Mexico has no leg to stand on legality for Trump changing Gulf to America, neither would Trump have any leg to stand on if Mexico makes those changes I suggested above.  Now morally, I agree with you, one is more wrong than the other, but that's very semantics as they are both wrong either way, just a matter of how wrong.",Fubi-FF,2025-05-09T21:09:27,0
