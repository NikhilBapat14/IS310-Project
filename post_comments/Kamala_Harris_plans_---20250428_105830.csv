I think scathing critiques are pointless against Trump.  He will just cry about it on social media and then use it to destroy American lives.   We need people in office to actually try and change things.,iggyfenton,2025-04-28T15:37:05,23

"Give me a break. The fact that she’s taken a backseat to all of this bs to lick her wounds instead of championing a major platform shift to build momentum and start good ground game screams the disingenuousness that the DNC has done for the last decade. Democrats with any aspirations for leadership CANNOT sit on their hands and fundraise off of rights we have lost.  The performative spirit of Cory Booker’s filibuster, sit in mean jack shit if all you’re doing is giving lip service with no substance.  The party needs serious change, not calculated pivots to tip the scales enough to get another corporate democrat to sit in, pad the judiciary while doing next to nothing to fix the damage done and make sure it never happens again.  Kamala, Pete, Cory, Hakeem, the list goes on. They need to be out there with AOC honing the political momentum AND establishing cornerstones of the new democratic party. If they think they can skirt issues like PAC funded campaigns, pro-lobbying, continuation of citizens united, mitigating climate disaster, etc. then we are all severely fucked from here on out.

"She can say whatever she wants but if she is thinking about another chance in the 2028 Presidential election, I won't thank her. Please go away we are saving the country here and the people can see who is genuine. Give other people a chance, who are truly determined and who touch the grass.   I personally hope her stay away from California gubernatorial election as well, but I guess California will have to be her place to retire. This is so frustrating.    Oh and remember, many female politicians have been criticizing Trump under real personal threat when the country is leaderless and in horror. For example, AOC and Jasmine Crockett. I am sure this is not mysogny at least for me, but she is just so unlikable and sometimes people just have to admit that. Stop cheating ourselves and support someone who can lead the people. ",davedans,2025-04-29T00:47:47,2

She did. I didn’t love Kamala either but if you watch the debates it’s kind of scary exactly how correct she was. Not like it would have been difficult for anyone candidate to say what would happen. But she did.,VERGExILL,2025-04-29T08:11:21,1

"Not everyone chooses who they vote for based on a cult-like devotion.  I never liked Harris - she wasn't well-loved in California, and did horribly in the 2020 primary.  She's too far right, too much of a former cop, and too lacking in a real vision for the future for a Democratic constituency outside of California.  At the same time, she's too not-male and too not-white for ""centrists"" or Republicans to cross over and make up for it.  However, Biden proved that he really couldn't run after the debate.  When she forced the issue to become the nominee, I supported her because she was better than Trump.  However, what she really should have done is set her ambition aside and let the people decide on a nominee with a lightning primary instead of forcing the issue via backroom deals.  So, yeah, there's plenty of room to criticize her while still having voted for her.",Ok_Basil351,2025-04-28T14:05:24,12
