"We already have customers calling in panicked confusion because they are totally checked out from the news.  The smart ones snapped up our non-tariffed inventory.  Prices are calculated on the cost at time of sailing, so the stuff that is landing now has the tariff price.  This will have a long tail, ocean-freight is usually 60 days on the water, then another 30 days in customs/unloading/rail/truck transport.  It the tariffs were canceled today, we'll still have higher prices for another two months.",Iowa_Dave,2025-05-09T10:06:25,22

"Yeah, knowing this was happening I made some big purchases that would be needed soon. On another thread I warned people that the expected date for the stuff to hit the shelves is around May 27.   The shit is on an imminent collision course with the fan. Good luck.",mattgen88,2025-05-09T10:16:38,8
IF they hit the selves at all! Lots of orders were canceled and shipment re-directed to countries with *sane* tariff policies.  [Unlike our current tariff policy.](https://i.imgur.com/mTtGQyh.png),Iowa_Dave,2025-05-09T10:24:27,6
