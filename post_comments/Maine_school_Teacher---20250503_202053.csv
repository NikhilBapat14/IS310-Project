"as a parent i would be very very concerned for the safety of my children, having a teacher who sincerely believes murder is an appropriate action. And mass murder. Not just one murder, She thinks the n appropriate action to her candidates not getting elected is to mass murder the ones who did get elected or appointed.  What happens when she decides murdering children is an appropriate step to demonstrate protest of admin?  what happens when she sees a child's parent wear a maga hat at parent teacher conference and decides murdering the child is an appropriate punishment for that parent?   That is what she is advocating. She needs to be fired ASAP",SerendipitySue,2025-05-04T18:00:50,1
