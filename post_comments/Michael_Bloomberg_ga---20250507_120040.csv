Is that Michael Bloomberg the environmental activist with an actual golf course on his vacation home in the high desert?  Or Michael Bloomberg the gun control advocate who bought a house *surrounded* by pro 2A people without worrying at all about being shot?

"***Regulations are executive*** \- this is influence buying straight from the shelf to the cash register.  ""What is the system going to do about this"" continue taking advantage, and continue punishing its enemies.

It's the Michael Bloomberg who ran the only presidential campaign that managed money worse than Kamala Harris' did.,BadDadJokes,2025-05-07T12:40:01,37
"He probably didn't even want to be president, it was probably more like ""check out how much money I can eject from my butthole"" and then his personal network grew ten times stronger from the unprecedented buddy-paying orgy.  Being president would have been stressful, just imagine the kind of a life a person can live when that's how much an ***I scratch your back, you scratch mine*** is worth.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T14:00:26,15
