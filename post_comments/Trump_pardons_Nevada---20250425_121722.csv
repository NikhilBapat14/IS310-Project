"He does this and then signs an executive order to investigate (persecute and then prosecute) ActBlue because he 'suspects illegal donations'.

"Honestly, it's just sickening how someone entrusted with honoring a fallen officer, you know, a real hero, used over $70,000 raised for that purpose to fund personal expenses like cosmetic surgery and, apparently, her daughter's wedding, and, really, isn't it shocking that these funds were diverted for such frivolous purposes instead of properly memorializing the officer, and what measures can be implemented to ensure a system of checks and balances prevents this kind of abuse of public trust from happening again?",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-25T12:28:40,14
