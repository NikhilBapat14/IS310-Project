"Started under Bush II when they forced work rules on us rather than negotiate a new contract. Tried to cut pay and worsen conditions, and they succeeded for about three years.

We’ve been short for 20 years, but now all of us who came on in the early 2000s are becoming eligible to retire, and we’ve seen a pretty significant pay cut when you consider inflation, plus we’re watching every airline pilot get 40% raises.

"As someone who has been an ATC for 15 years, I assure you that many, many politicians are to blame for dropping the ball. This has been going on my entire career and then some. And yes, I blame Pete too, because he could have done more, said more, gotten the media talking. Unfortunately, just like every other department secretary, he was surrounded by bureaucrats that blew sunshine up his ass instead of telling the truth. Hell, maybe the bureaucrats don't even know the truth; it wouldn't surprise me. FAA management never wants bad news; they only want to hear good things.  The simple fact is that the frontline ATCs and Tech Ops folks, while working under ridiculous conditions with failing, ancient equipment, lack of staffing, lack of spare parts, stagnant pay, and horrible hours, have kept American airspace safe and efficient despite all of it. Because it's important, because it matters, and because our people are some of the best in the world. Unfortunately, your politicians have used us over and over again as political pawns while shoestringing our budget.   Its time for folks to contact their congress people and start demanding that the people that keep American airspace safe, that generate almost a trillion dollars for the GDP, that keep millions of people safe EVERY DAY, deserve pay that matches cost of living increases, deserve hours that aren't literally killing them, and equipment that doesn't just work but is the best in the world.",Schmitty21,2025-05-08T10:46:13,-7

"I am an air traffic controller. There is a reason for the shortages, and most redditors aren't going to like it. But READ THIS because its important to understand what happened and how we got where we are today.   Starting under Obama, there was a huge push to increase diversity at the FAA. This is an honorable effort as everyone deserves a fair shot.   The FAA decided that rather than using its test that had been in place for decades, they would change the Academy entry test that would allow people from more diverse backgrounds to score higher than they had. Instead of focusing on testing for spatial thinking ability, the evaluation now must consider other things, like participation in sports.   As a direct result, applicants that otherwise would have been qualified were passed over.   https://mslegal.org/2019/11/biographical-questions-forced-top-atc-candidates-out-of-faa-hiring-pool/  And when that didn't work, minority applicants were shockingly given answers to the tests by, well, read this yourself -   https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring  The FAA passed over college graduates with degrees in avaiation, even licensed controllers from the military, and gave Academy slots to people off the street.   The FAA Academy only has so many spots. When these new applicants were admitted, the washout rate skyrocketed. The FAA graduated FAR less than the normal 2500 new controllers every year that had been trained. This is what has caused the shortages you see today. The Academy lost out on the opportunity to train thousands of better qualified applicants chasing numbers.   Every controller today is qualified to be where they are regardless of race. But, there would be far more controllers working today if race hadn't been a driving factor in the past...",747WakeTurbulance,2025-05-08T08:28:26,-33

I wish he could point to his accomplishments over 4 years amd say I left this a much better place. It's hard to do as secretary of transportation because no one even knows what they do or even remotely how they effect everyday life except maybe air traffic control. It would of been a great accomplishment to say I fixed this mess, I modernized the system, cut the bureaucracy and got it done. I know how to effectively govern at a high level.

Those targets have never been close to 2,500. The highest target since 2011 was 1,780, and that year the actual hires were 1,880.  (Source:2023 NATCA report addressing shortages.)  The amount of TRAINEES is 2500. Which is an actual 900 student decrease since the hiring practices changed. The hiring targets have never been close to that.

"Their gender and race were not the sole reason they lost, they are major contributing factors.   [This article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-say-they-would-vote-for-a-woman-but/) from a few years ago says that when surveyed 8% of Americans plainly said they would never vote for a woman. While I'm sure the majority of them are already strongly right leaning if even a quarter are Democrats that 2% of voters could be the difference in a close race.   And I'm sure that there are more people that would effectively never vote for a woman that wouldn't admit that during a phone survey. I can't find a similar statistic about non-white or non-cishet candidates but I doubt it would be better.   The article also addressed the invisible impact of gender too. Women's behavior is interpreted very differently than men's behavior.   I would be interested in seeing a source that women and men win roughly the same number of elections against each other.

"I don't know how exactly we reconcile the notion that ""some of the population is sexist"" and ""the population votes for women 50% of the time over men,"" but I'll give the relevancy nod to the studies directly measuring actual outcomes (voting) over the studies that have to be extrapolated over multiple steps to get to the point (factors influencing voting).  Finding sources was more difficult than expected, since trying to get search engines to grok the difference between *how people vote for male vs female candidates* and *how men vs women vote for candidates* was no easy task, but here's a few recent studies/articles.  LGBTQ+ Victory Institute 2017: [""LGBTQ women candidates endorsed by Victory Fund won their elections at significantly higher rates than LGBTQ men candidates, and that the difference is statistically significant. LGBTQ women also perform well in years when Democrats struggle at the polls, despite LGBTQ men performing worse in those years. The disparity is notable given research shows women and men as a whole win elections at approximately the same rate.""](https://victoryinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VictoryInstitute_GenderAnalysisBriefing_080117.pdf)  Rutgers Center of American Women and Politics 2021: [""Non-incumbent women candidates for the U.S. House won primary elections at higher rates than non-incumbent men overall and in both major parties."" ... ""Non-incumbent Republican and Democratic women House nominees won general election contests at higher rates than their male counterparts.""](https://womenrun.rutgers.edu/2020-report/by-the-numbers/)  Stanford Report (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Yale ISPS) 2022: [""...academic research has found that in general elections, and U.S. Congressional races in particular, women candidates receive approximately the same level of support as men."" ... ""Our research suggests that pragmatic bias—the withholding of support for members of groups for whom success is perceived to be difficult or impossible to achieve—hinders women’s access to political leadership.""](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2022/02/groupthink-gone-wrong-assumptions-electability-undermine-women-political-candidates)  American Journal of Political Science 2023: [...""men and women win at equal rates contingent on running.""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12785)  > Though that still would hide the fact that a woman would still need to win her party's nomination for whatever that position is, so if they think that area wouldn't elect a woman they wouldn't run one.  Indeed. Women are less likely to run, which obviously leads to fewer women in office overall, and that is its own problem which is likely somewhat rooted in sexism. But when they do run -- when they overcome both ""pragmatic bias"" and any actual biases to actually get on the ballot --  they win just as often as men. People didn't think Obama could win either, because he was black, until he did. Resoundingly.  I'd wager Hillary lost primarily because of Comey's ""but her emails"" announcement days before the election, plus her absolutely horrible campaign dripping with entitlement. Also mind that she still significantly won the popular vote, by a larger margin than Trump beat Harris. The Democratic Party was doomed in the 2024 election the moment Biden chose to run for a second term and stepped down late. Kamala did the best she could, and ran an excellent campaign, but she was facing down being an unvoted-for candidate and a late start to her campaign; any other candidate would've been *even more* hamstrung by the lack of funding, since nobody else had access to the existing Biden-Harris war chest. I likewise don't believe the simple matter of Pete being gay would hold him back, if he runs a good campaign and avoids major external problems.  TL;DR The problem might not be that Pete is unelectable, it's enough people *believing* he's unelectable that he may not even try to get elected.

"When gay people can’t get married, then it will definitely be equal as it was in 2005. But as it stands the queer community has far more rights than we did 20 years ago (sodomy wasn’t decided in the sc until like 2003), especially at the state level in places like MN and CA, and as an Arizonan, here too, at the municipal level.",whorl-,2025-05-08T10:30:32,2

"The difference is the boomers vote, liberals and progressives don't. You need to appeal to the boomers in your party.   Also AOC hate is far from restricted to older right wing people.

"Yep, you are perfectly representative of the stereotype of a thoughtless kid that cares more about sounding cool and scoring dunks or whatever you people say than actually winning an election with an actionable platform.   Frankly people like you are why progress only happens when people get old enough that their progressive ideas now seem fairly conservative compared to what kids are yammering about.",JMehoffAndICoomhardt,2025-05-08T11:36:47,1
