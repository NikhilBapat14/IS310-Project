"The likelihood that Trump has ever been to Alcatraz is zero. If he had, he would know this idea is completely ridiculous.

"For those wondering about this...  * Alcatraz was a fort going back to 1850.  * It was turned into a prison in 1934 (using some of the same buildings from the fort for staff housing). * It required 155 staff and held 260-275 average prisoners with 302 at its max. * It only operated for 29 years. * It closed because it was too expensive to operate per prisoner *and* was in serious disrepair in large part to salt water erosion. * It sits right in the middle of both shipping lanes and recreational boating routes.   * It's currently run by the National Park Service with tour operations leased to concessionaires. * The tourism directly brings in tens of millions of dollars annually, with the lease revenue resulting in a surplus to the National Park Service.  In other words, Alcatraz today is ""profitable"". * Indirectly, it contributes to the tourism of the area including many people who come and see or participate in other activities, but never buy a ticket to the island itself. * As a result of the Native American occupation of the island in 1969-1971, there are now exhibits, signs, and talks about Native history on the island.  There is nothing to re-open on the island.  To open a prison on the island, you'd need to pretty much clear everything, which would be prohibitively expensive in of itself and result in all kinds of protests from people representing environmental, history, boating, tourism, Native American, shipping, and other concerns just in the clearing of the island itself.  So not only would revenue be lost from tourism and it would be very expensive to tear down, building it would be outrageous expensive too again to state the obvious, its an island surrounded by some of the most expensive real estate in the country.  Everything is expensive here.  That also means that the staff there would require much higher pay due to the cost of living and conditions.  For example, monthly parking in the area in SF *starts* at $435.  Besides the usual prison staffing requirements, you'd also need to patrol the waters 24/7.  Back in the day, this wasn't required, but today, you'd be dealing with a ton of traffic from recreational boaters, jet skis, and shipping.  The Escape...  All of the above, and for what?  The idea that it can't be escaped from?  No, as someone who's been doing the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon for a few years now, the ""island"" factor isn't much of a concern.",mredofcourse,2025-05-05T12:06:00,9

"San Francisco native here.  If you've ever been to Alcatraz, you'll soon discover why it's a tourist destination and not a federal prison.  Upgrading all facilities would be enormous—everything there requires replacement.  So, think from the bottom up.  It's analogous to building a new city on an abandoned island.    Second, it won't hold that many inmates. Its max capacity is somewhere around 300. That can't possibly justify the cost of rehabbing the entire place. Places like Pelican Bay are better suited to deal with what trump calls violent inmates. Alcatraz last held inmates in 1963. Prisons in 1963 do not look like prisons in 2025.    Third, who works there?  This admin has already gutted federal organizations or is currently doing so.    Fourth, running the place (assuming it's up and current with code) is also an unreal expense.  The salt air corrodes everything.  Take a look to the west a bit and see the GG bridge. Painting the bridge because of the salt air is an ongoing process.  Once they finish painting the bridge, they almost have to return to the beginning and start over.  The salt air is that bad.  It was closed in 1963 because of high costs. Even then, the infrastructure was going bad.  It's not much different today.  Anything that goes to the island has to go by boat.  That's costly.    This is some weak attempt to look ""tough.""  The place is a money pit. Leave it for the tourists.",Comedyisntfree,2025-05-05T14:00:54,7

After the initial plot line (when it moves into how the administration actually governs), if you watch it from the perspective of Trump believing he’s the “good guy” (Kiefer Sutherland), it plays out like a damn playbook for nearly everything that Trump is doing. Trump is doing it with a lot less coherence and in a more bumbling fashion—but almost every plot line is literally just what Trump is doing. And it really highlights the American obsession with “good guys can break the rules because they’re ‘good’ and the ends justify the means” — bringing up the question of “what is ‘good’?” Because MAGA sure does believe they’re on the right side of history. 😭  Anyway, it’s almost as if Trump just watched a bunch of political dramas, envisioned himself the main character, and is just playing them out.
