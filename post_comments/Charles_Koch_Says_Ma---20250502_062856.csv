"I read an interesting theory that a lot of the mess we're in is because we finally have a new generation of conservatives in power who actually believe the shit they've been told and say. Koch is the worst and we can blame a lot of shit on him certainly, but I think he and the old guard foolishly thought the republican party could maintain it's grift while maintaining the...I guess hypocritical surface level ""values"" of American exceptionalism. Let's call it a controlled corruption. A controlled burn to get money and power but keeping the framework of America as we know it. That while they hurt people and and spread propaganda, they thought the leadership would always keep ship above water. They were evil, but not stupid.  But after a couple generations of this the monster is out of control. We have a party over fed on propaganda, that had their violent impulses encouraged, and corrupt beyond just wanting a few more zeros in their account. It's like a drug dealing operation being run by a corrupt business man who never touched the stuff. He just wanted money. And then gets taken over by by the addicts themselves.",LocalEquivalent52,2025-05-02T08:38:06,28

"Ever heard of the heritage foundation, the CATO institute, Americans for prosperity? All of these groups have guided the “conservative” movement that Charles is complaining about losing its principles. They funded the dark money groups who have fucked over us, our kids, and all of our grandkids. They highjacked the Tea Party movement because they didn’t want to pay for the environmental damage their companies are still causing, and they were so successful with that they expanded to CPAC and got us Trump because they convinced republicans that they should abandon their values so the Koch’s could make some more money. When Mitch McConnell is voting with the democrats, that shows how far out of being principled the republicans are currently. It’s a death cult that only reacts in ways of just doing the opposite of what’s told they need to do. They abandoned conservatism so they didn’t have to lose a little bit of profit, and we’re all gonna pay the price for that.",RttnAttorney,2025-05-02T14:52:21,1

"Sure, but he wasn't inherently 'created' evil, it was a learned behavior from the doctor. I feel like this is a theme that is often ignored but is central to really understanding the work. The Dr. was outwardly human but a monster on the inside, and the creation was monstrous on the outside but an innocent on the inside that became corrupted because of the doctor's (and societal) reaction to his existence. I'd still argue that the more monstrous between the two was by far the doctor.   But your point is valid, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when the creature actually became the monster he looked like.",freelance-t,2025-05-02T11:28:46,11

Haha. You don’t know what government overreach is. Koch believes that government should not have any authority that it’s been given by the constitution. So you either understand the constitution or you support Koch. It’s one or the other. Either you get behind the constitution or you bend over for Koch.
