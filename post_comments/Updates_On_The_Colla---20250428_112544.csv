"I’d recommend people give Michael Crichton’s book State of Fear a read. It’s a good story, but his prologue and epilogue and appendix are eye openers to the environmentalism movement and the actual damage it’s caused to the environment as well as to human rights and aid causes.",ITrCool,2025-04-28T13:05:19,4
