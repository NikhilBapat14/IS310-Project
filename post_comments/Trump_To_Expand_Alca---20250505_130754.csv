Wasn’t NYC like a super max prison basically?   They put up a giant wall around it and let it become a powerless rotting cesspit city-sized prison?   Kurt Russel’s character had to go free the president from its clutches when he was taken prisoner.   That was about as classic 80s apocalypse action flik as it gets.,ITrCool,2025-05-05T14:32:15,3
Please don’t punish me I have to live here (I make really good money in CA until it collapses lol),Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-05T14:20:20,4
"Every state has the same story. Cities are blue, everything else is red. From Wyoming to California, the story is the same. I could show you places here in CA where almost every other house has a Trump flag, Gadsden Flag, anti lefty, etc...   So, always keep in mind conservatives/Republicans in blue states, not only exist but are arguably the most steadfast. 9 Million people voted for trump in CA. 9 million people that knew that their vote didn't matter, but did so anyway.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-05T22:10:36,1
You all realize why trump does that AI right?  To keep the trolls acting like fools,Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-06T10:32:49,1
