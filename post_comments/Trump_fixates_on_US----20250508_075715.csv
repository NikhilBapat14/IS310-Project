"Sure, let’s redraw the border and have it extend south so that the west coast states are now part of Canada.  As a WA resident I’d be all for that.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-08T08:06:53,16
Assume the worst with Trump. Just wait.  When MAGA feels the pain they’ll eat their own and Canada will be putting troops on the border.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-08T08:06:29,13
"I don't think there is any illusion that Trump isn't serious about taking over Canada and Greenland.  He honestly believes that Canadians and Greenlanders will want to become part of the US and he can use economic pressure  to bring them to the point of capitulation.  The danger here is the regime is failing on a number of fronts and nothing is more dangerous than a cornered animal.  If their power is threatened (protest, uprising, courts, elections, etc.), the bluster that is truly nonsensical right now could turn into military action.  And let's not put it past this regime to create a situation where they justify their actions.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T08:25:40,7

He is a moron wanting to do moron things.  And he has a giant group of minion morons who will help him do it.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-08T08:27:54,5
"he definitely wants this, he is trying to normalize it,  and Fox YT Channel comments of MAGGOTS reflect the brainwashing ,  it's actually scary",timetogetoutside100,2025-05-08T08:14:36,3

Just a thought but he wants one wall built and tear another one down.,zepploon,2025-05-08T08:19:31,2
I know that several states would be on-board with becoming part of Canada. Maybe Carney should suggest that to Trump?,ddr1ver,2025-05-08T08:24:23,2
Point Roberts should be part of Canada.,comox,2025-05-08T09:24:09,2

"If only. I would move to Washington in a heartbeat if it meant I could not be apart of this country. Unfortunately, working class means you're stuck living in this hellscape reality because moving away is not in the cards especially now.  ",arilupe,2025-05-08T08:12:57,3
As for Canada they did seem to think Canada would fall with in 2 months now Canada is getting stronger they have no clue what to do.,jjaime2024,2025-05-08T08:44:16,9
"The one thing I'm encouraged by is that military action has - so far - been off the table, and they've even come out and said so. They're threatening Greenland with it, but not Canada.   Given that, and the level of Canadian and worldwide resistance to the annexation threats so far, I think (I hope!) they might be having some doubts at this point. And they've got plenty of their own problems at home.   I'm still thinking about what my family and I would do in a worst-case scenario, but I believe that's becoming less likely.",zapperdumples,2025-05-08T09:45:43,3
"Agreed, the regime has greatly underestimated the degree to which Canadians value their sovereignty and their willingness to pivot to other alliances.  And I continue to believe the US military understands a takeover of Canada might be quick initially given US military power but holding territory would be impossible.  So it's all bluster and noise.  What's disturbing to me is the degree to which this regime talks of issues as if there isn't a possible change in approach coming through a next election.  Their assumption is one of permanence, which I think is alarming for both Americans and Canadians.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T08:54:13,10
How dumb do you have to be to think that getting Canada would be easy?   Trump dumb. That's how dumb.,verifiedboomer,2025-05-08T12:14:16,2
"Agreed, unfortunately.  I try not to overthink the Trump regime.  Bluntly, Greenland would be easier to occupy and hold than Canada.  I think it's that simple.  But the US is already in violation of the UN agreement...  *Article 2(4) of the UN Charter requires all members to ""refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state"".*  That the Trump regime is doing so against well established allies in Canada and Denmark (and thus the EU) is beyond problematic.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T09:56:43,2
