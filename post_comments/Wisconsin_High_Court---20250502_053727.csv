I don’t read much into this.  They are just going to suspend her and see how the charges play out.  They can’t leave her on the bench while she’s facing federal charges because it would hurt the public’s perception of the court.  They also probably won’t fire her before the case is resolved because of the old innocent until proven guilty standard.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-05-02T07:22:25,27

"Wtf? If I did that. Id be fired and facing charges.  If she aa a judge doesn't lose her jugdgeship and law license. Then it's bs, one system for us and then one for them.   Similar to how i dont support defunding police but THE POLICE DOES NEED MAJOR REFORM. LOTS OF COPS BREAK THE LAW BUT THEN IT GETS TOSSED OUT. Its on video too and the judges just toss it out. One law for us and different for them.",craig_52193,2025-05-02T06:05:15,11
