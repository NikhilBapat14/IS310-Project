This is infuriating.  >The children just went with their mothers.   After prohibiting them to arrange for the father or a family member to take them. We're also deporting kids that are also citizens undergoing cancer treatment.   Fucking ghouls and anyone defending it.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-27T15:20:57,197
"We could also not deport the mother of two US children. It's so schizophrenic. We're going to give mothers medals, but godforbid you're from Latin/South America or we'll deport you all. But the kids are ""welcome"" back later? Who is this for??",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-27T15:25:22,41
Oh how generous.   The child with cancer need only survive.,medes24,2025-04-27T15:20:02,39

Rubio should set the example and self deport for being a traitor to our Constitution.,williamgman,2025-04-27T15:34:20,12
"Nice downplaying. It should be easy for a 2 year old to pay for a plane ticket and navigate international travel to come back to a country that wants to kidnap their family while wearing street-clothes and send them to a prison no one leaves alive. And now ICE can break into your house and forcibly remove you without a warrant.   If there is a god, Rubio, Bondi, Noem and Trump have condemned this country for a generation.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-27T15:34:06,10
"Rubio’s statement: ""If you're in this country unlawfully, you have no right to be here,"" Rubio said during a visit to ""Meet the Press."" ""Three U.S. citizens were not deported...their mothers, who were illegally in this country, were deported. The children just went with their mothers.""",RoughWestern9152,2025-04-27T15:23:44,9

"JFC, Rubio. Some people are just born without empathy or logic, I guess.",jayfeather31,2025-04-27T15:28:16,5
Everything this administration does is haphazard and such a mess. Trump has put together a messier group of people to run his administration than a producer of a trashy reality TV show which I guess is how Trump sees government.,mkt853,2025-04-27T15:29:34,6
Pretty ballsy for a guy named Rubio.,TheorySudden5996,2025-04-27T15:37:31,6

"Just curious, the centrists on here that I saw defending the Rubio Pick, are we at the point where we have learned republicans as a whole are bad choices yet? Or are we gonna have a whole Romney thing with him too for years until the next one comes along, rinse and repeat?",Clownsinmypantz,2025-04-27T16:05:15,5
This is not the party that supports families.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T16:19:38,4
Why are those Children gone in the first place?  They're American Citizens.  This is just plain wrong on every level it's despicable.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-27T16:27:10,4

"You are compromised by accepting  this job.  You could have looked like a reasonable Republican in a few years, by contrast.  Go have some coffee with Tillerson, Sullivan, and Pompeo.

The longer he spends in the trump admin the more down trodden and soulless his eyes look. He can't honestly believe the things he's having to say.,MonarchMagnetic,2025-04-27T19:04:38,1
Key takeaway: Rubio is a fucking ghoul who is wiping Trump’s ass for zero gain.,TechnicallyAnybody,2025-04-27T15:48:58,55
"He says 'Went' instead of, 'the federal government took them into custody and put them on a plane to a country where they are not a citizen with no legal recourse or due process.'",GoodIdea321,2025-04-27T16:40:53,10

"Let's be real, it's for *white* Christian mothers. This is entirely in line with Project 2025 and the rhetoric of the right wing over the last several years. They're just still able to obfuscate with more innocuous language, because they know that most folks are still afraid to call them on it for fear of rocking the boat or appearing rude. God forbid anybody feels awkward calling out encroaching fascism. Decades of the mainstream right wing decrying every slight criticism as evidence of extreme bias has trained the media and the Democratic party as a whole to always treat the right wing with kid gloves and presumed innocence, no matter how obvious the lie.   Sorry for the rant, but they've been building towards this for the last two decades, and now they're finally pulling the trigger.",Crommach,2025-04-27T16:14:37,8

"There were countless idiots defending it because they weren't ""technically deported.""   * Are they in the US? No  * Were they allowed to make arrangements? No   So if they'd like we can just call it kidnapping/trafficking instead of deporting? Also, don't courts really hate it when one parent absconds with their kids to a foreign country?",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-27T15:26:15,19
