I could see her running for a senate seat. There will be a lot of retirements in the republican party if Trumps numbers keep tanking.,baby_budda,2025-04-19T23:24:06,351
"I hate to say this because I love her and I really wanted Elizabeth Warren. But if we want to take back the white house ( which we HAVE TO), I don't think enough Americans are ready to elect a female president.  This isn't just any election. This could be the final stand against fascism to preserve our democracy.  We need to find someone who will be supported by a MAJORITY and that will garner swing votes. There is a fracture happening in the republican party right now and I think some are itching for a chance to get away from trump. But even some of those I fear would be more inclined to do so if the candidate is a male. Not to mention the only candidate to beat Trump (biden) was a male.  I hope someday we can elect a female president. And even a gay president.  But we can't risk this I fear.",AlienReprisal,2025-04-20T01:34:38,233
"AOC win the presidency?  Are you serious?    Not in a million years of Sundays.  If the Dems are serious about winning the office they need to nominate a charismatic southerner along the line of Bill Clinton.  A man (yes, i said a  man) who can win southern states like Clinton did and combined with the north east and the pacific states carry the day.",RL203,2025-04-20T06:50:34,29
No. It's time for the Dems to have a proper primary and nominate a candidate that can win.,Yay_duh,2025-04-20T02:44:53,47
She has an extremely low chance of winning a primary and an even lower chance of winning the general election.  All the republicans need to say is “she admits she’s a socialist” over and over again and just play the highlight or reel of clips of her saying ridiculous things and it’s basically an automatic win.  Not to mention she’ll be even more unpopular among men than Kamala. A lot of anti Trump people would simply stay home than vote for her. In 2020 Biden absolutely needed every single anti Trump person to vote (aided by making voting easier via pandemic rules) to win a narrow 43K victory in the swing states and that was while Trump was unpopular in the midst of a pandemic so don’t assume Trump being unpopular results in a world where she can win.,vsv2021,2025-04-20T02:01:20,18
"TL;DR: AOC, like Bernie, likely wouldn’t win the presidency because her alignment with the “far left” alienates most moderate voters. Biden’s 2020 win empirically showed that the majority of non Trump aligned voters prefer centrist, stable leadership over aggressive progressive platforms. The “far left” often fails to recognize this broader voter preference.  Maybe. But I don’t that she would have much of a chance to secure the presidency. Bernie could not even win in the democratic primaries much less vs Trump in the general.   This is the frustration that the majority of the country has with the “far left”. They seem to not “get it”. Joe Biden winning the nomination and then the presidency in 2020, is empirical evidence that the majority of voters who are not already supporters of Donal Trump are also largely NOT aligned with the “far left”.   The majority of voters value relative economic stability, relative social equality, and non identity politics.  The “far left” time and time again campaigns on an aggressive imposition of social equality that often comes off as elevating the status of the “poor” at the expense of the “elite”.  AOC could serve as Bernie’s successor, but I don’t think that she would have a legitimate chance of becoming president because of how she has thus far ingrained herself as a champion of what I have described above.  She would receive votes from very few centrist independents, a handful of left leaning democrats, only a plurality of the remaining democrats, as well as the support of the “far left” democrats. She would be hard pressed to receive a single vote from any on the fence republican.",LingonberryALittle,2025-04-20T08:04:57,8
"It's great to see the energy, but Kamala was filling arenas too and it didn't help in the swing states. The way to win the next election is not to go harder left--in fact, the more progressive part of the Dem platform (obsession with identity politics, pronouns, oppressed vs oppressor philosophy of life) is likely one of the primary reasons Dems lost. Don't forget, Biden basically picked Kamala bc she was a black woman. He did the same with Justice Jackson. That's not saying they were not qualified--they certainly are... BUT making promises to pick a certain race/gender before even vetting candidates is superbly unfair and played into the narrative that Dems care more about identity politics over everything else, including inflation, immigration, education, etc.  The answer isn't to tack farther left with another female POC. Sorry to say, but it's true. Dems need another Bill Clinton that can connect with more centrist voters in middle America swing states. Dems need to kill and bury woke identity politics once and for all if they ever want to win again.",johnnygalt1776,2025-04-20T12:23:31,5
"Yes, he’s trying to encourage his supporters to support AOC.   No, AOC doesn’t have a snowballs chance in hell at winning the presidency, and likely couldn’t win the nomination either.   AOC is not a good debater. She’s been humiliated by random congressional witnesses. If she has to debate someone who’s actually good at debating, she’s toast.   Democrats have run 2 women so far. Both lost pretty handily. Democrats elites don’t want that again.",slayer_of_idiots,2025-04-20T01:35:37,61
"No self-described socialist has a shot at the presidency. Socialism is political poison in this country. I think people need a cold bucket of reality when talking about Bernie/AOC. These are politicians that exists within the confines of extremely Democratic areas (~D+30). They have no broad appeal on a national stage.  Bernie Sanders lost the primary in 2016, and proceeded to lose it even harder in 2020 (when superdelegates weren’t really a factor). AOC’s ceiling is maybe the Senate.",HiSno,2025-04-20T03:04:24,33
"It's hard to predict currently because we're so early into this 2nd Trump term. Yes, what Trump is doing now is horrendous as he ignores the constitution and courts, and manipulates the markets so he and his buddies can get richer. But I also know this country is very vibe based and short memory.   If the Fight Oligarchy tour continues to grow and people see a side of AOC that isn't already predetermined based on biased media portrayals of her, she might break those perceptions and punch through in a mainstream way that no amount of spin from Fox News or NewsMax can tank her. We've seen it happen before with Obama, he upended hundreds of years of tradition with being the first black man to win the presidency, so I don't like to say something is impossible.   But again, we're a vibes country. She will have to keep the energy and momentum up for the next 3.5 years, sharpen her debating skills, and keep at it. The moment Trump lost in 2020, he immediately set out to run for 2024 and kept at it til he won again, as annoying as that was. He stayed accessible by the media, and had an ever presence. He makes stupid mistakes constantly, but he's just there constantly, too, keeping the vibes going. AOC has to do the same.",[deleted],2025-04-20T06:47:04,3
"The only way AOC has a path to even standing in the 2028 DNC primary is if 2026 has a huge Blue wave. I mean a ton of Senate races go to blue. In addition, much of those wins need to include vocal progressive wins over incumbent Dems and Republicans.  That would be the only valid signal that she should bother trying.  The only way I see that happening is if Dems start loudly campaigning now on:  1. Civil rights and the right to due process 2. How the economy is rigged for the rich 3. Single payer healthcare and student loan forgiveness 4. Ending munition transfers to nations that bomb civilians.  And won. I am not saying those 4 issues would deal make a huge blue wave. Just that if they campaigned on pro-democracy and progressive issues AND won, then that would be a signal that America could be ready to elect someone like AOC president.",InFearn0,2025-04-20T13:05:28,3

"Not if she keeps to the Bernie Sanders base.  He failed to get past the primary stage twice so far and in this country a woman of color will have it even harder.  She needs to expand outside of the left wing base, she needs a wider ranging message that appeals ideally to white working class.   Now, I think she can do this. She’s a very smart political actor and her rhetorical skills are only improving. But she needs to surpass Bernie to have a shot.",CombinationLivid8284,2025-04-20T05:29:20,16
"The idea that she can’t win is based purely on traditional establishment democrat wisdom, which has proved less than useless in the last 8 years. Americans don’t want the middle. They want change.

"Sanders should be grooming multiple successors if he wants his movement to survive and *grow*  But to address the core question:  Sanders himself is not viable as a presidential candidate. He couldn't win a Democratic Party primary at his peak, and would be unable to win the general due to being much further left than the general American populace  The movement he champions could possibly have a shot in the distant future, but a lot more work needs to be put in to *grow* it",theyfellforthedecoy,2025-04-20T20:43:08,2
"*Is Bernie Sanders grooming AOC to become his successor*  Clearly, yes.  He wants to be a kingmaker and this is a pre-campaign tour.  *does she have a chance to win the presidency in 2028?*  No.  She is far to the left of most Democratic voters.  You could expect a repeat of 2024, with the non-white center and religious social conservatives staying home or possibly even flipping.  Bill Clinton and Obama knew that they needed religious voters who were not socially liberal.  Today's Democrats appear to be blind to this reality, even if the exit polls should make this clear.  She has the disadvantage of being in a very safe blue district, so she doesn't know what it's like to work for a vote.  That being said, she shows signs of becoming more mainstream liberal and she could become a force to be reckoned with.  But she would need to become her own person, get out from under Sanders, and learn to build relationships with the kinds of constituents that Democrats need to win the White House.  That means black churchgoers in Michigan and working-class Catholics in Nevada who aren't exactly socially liberal.  She should remember that Sanders lost two Democratic primaries by landslide margins.  He may seem like a benefit to her now, but he has the potential to become a liability.",I405CA,2025-04-19T19:33:42,20
"This thread just opens the door to a lot of wayward misogyny and defeated thinking.   There are enough conservative women politicians to say that conservatives will vote for a woman.  The problem with Clinton and Harris as candidates was that they didn’t have a strong vision of who they will be as presidents and what they will bring to America. Pretty much the same problem as DEMs has as a party.  I’d vote for AOC, though I think she is a bit too young and agism is real when it comes to politics, not for voting, but for the actual business of it. I’d vote for Elizabeth Warren. I’d vote for Michelle Obama in a heartbeat if she would run.   Honestly, I think the biggest thing a presidential candidate needs to have with voters is a family with children. Look around. You don’t see a lot of childless politicians for a reason.

"I doubt it. It’s not that she doesn’t have the ability but more that parties aren’t as cut and dry as each party wants you to believe. The reason the presidency swings back and forth is because those who would be more traditionally conservative or liberal swing back and forth as extreme candidates tend to push the pendulum.

"Yes to the first question as it’s pretty clear Bernie doesn’t have a ton of time left (maybe a decade max) and someone needs to carry on his legacy. AOC is the most popular politician with the most similar policies, so she’s the logical successor. As for a Presidential run in 2028…I don’t exactly feel confident in her as the broader electorate might be a bit split on her still, and after the last election, it’s pretty clear Americans are still hesitant to elect a woman period, and AOC has the disadvantage of being under 40. For some, that’s a strength, but I worry that “undecided” voters will view that as a weakness especially when you factor in her gender, as young women can be seen as less experienced and/or immature (her voice doesn’t help in this department - again not throwing shade - I like her and support her, but I’m making an educated guess on how the broader electorate might feel)  I think she has a better chance of a successful Presidential run in 2032 or 2036",thedynamicdreamer,2025-04-20T15:48:05,1

"So here's the thing, the right has done an amazing job of brainwashing a VERY significant portion of Americans. From straight up MAGA brainwashing, to at least tainting the back of the minds for many others.   What this means is unfortunately dems need to pick a ""safe"" candidate. WAY TOO MANY people have negative opinions on AOC without even knowing a single thing about her.   Pete Buttigieg is gay, and was part of the Biden admin.   Gavin Newsom is from California.  Both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have too much baggage from Biden (and Kamala is a woman.... and black... wait, no... Indian... wait, she laughs....)   J.B. Pritzker is ""from Chicago"".   I don't know if you can push anyone who has ran in the primaries before as well.    I think they need someone younger, and from a purple or at least more red state. I think this pushes Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear.  I think these two (or at least more in line with these two) have less baggage, and potentially help their states go their way if they were popular. My favorite is Andy Beshear since he's from Kentucky. He was reelected so that shows some level of popularity (he won his first election because KY was really pissed at the incumbent), but in fairness both elections were not pres election years, so lower turnout, but even then his numbers are better than how the state votes for pres.   Anyway, I think dems need to play the game, they need to put up some straight white guy, and play the game. I think Pete has made a pretty good name for himself under Biden's cabinet, and maybe having AOC do the same will help her image.   But unfortunately too many dems have too much baggage for the average American, fair or not.   (FYI, if you're going to downvote me, don't do so for my ""criticisms"" of those above. I couldn't care less about gay or sex or race or anything like that.

It is important to point out that the democratic strategy since at least 2016 has been to try to target moderate suburban voters with college degrees.

This strategy has proven to be trash. People would rather just vote for republicans than republican-lite.     There was a lot of left-leaning voters that stayed home because Kamala Harris didn't excite them or throw them a bone. The vast majority of this country are upset with the status quo. They dislike the career corporate politicians that talk a big game but haven't actually done anything in decades. Even when they do things, it is so boggled down by adhering to processes that no one actuals feels any of the progress. People were so upset at the status quo they literally voted for a felon insurrectionist that was promising retribution than for the status quo.     What people want, is fucking healthcare. People want an increase in living standards. People want housing. People want fighters that actually get shit done. Progressives are those people.

"Good grief he lost in a landslide twice. 2016, his campaign was entirely “I’m not Hillary Clinton and want to give everyone free ponies.” Also the DNC didn’t line it up for Clinton, she had been a member of the party for decades and had built up good will among the voters who selected her during the primary process. Sanders on the other hand had demonized Dems his entire career and disparaged the voters. Why would anyone want to vote for someone who felt they were too good to join their party and looked down on them to win their party’s nomination? A few weeks later wouldn’t have changed a damn thing for Sanders, he was quite unpopular with the voters of the party. It only appeared to be close because he refused to drop out when he was mathematically eliminated and because Dems use proportional allocation of delegates. If they used the GOP method with winner take all in later states, he’s absolutely destroyed even worse.   2020, Sanders was winning with a plurality of voters after 4 states, that is correct. However, when other candidates recognized they were not resonating with voters and couldn’t win, they stepped aside to ensure there would not be a messy convention with a plurality winner instead of the outright majority. Sanders was unable to pick up their supporters because not only was his ideology not the majority of the party, but he once again demonized anyone who wouldn’t support him. He gave no reason for voters of Buttigieg or Klobuchar to back him over anyone else in the race. You can blame Warren for not stepping out all you want, but she felt that she still had a path to victory.   Sanders doing well with a plurality of voters in 4 states didn’t entitle him to be anointed the nominee as he wanted, there was still a full primary ahead of them. Thank goodness candidates started to drop out early instead of dragging their candidacies out like he did in 2016. It would have likely lead to a situation where Sanders would have a plurality at the convention of roughly 30% and then you see the moderate majority of the party unite to back Biden or another moderate choice to be the nominee and cause the Bernie or busters to return and hand Trump another win like they did in 2016.",BadPumpkin87,2025-04-19T23:25:14,13

She would just buckle at the slightest bit of pushback.  >She will never win Pennsylvania if she maintains her ban on fracking and that would be a massive flip flop since she’s literally the activist who brought up the idea of banning fracking and embracing the green new deal.

"working class base   You’re losing me with that vocabulary, and I think she uses it too.  “Working class” is not an appropriate term in the US, and it will take more than downvotes on Reddit to convince me otherwise.  The US was founded on principles of equality; the Declaration of Independence states it.  Divisions by class were to be left in Europe.  People aren’t locked into a class where they’re required to behave in a certain way toward other people locked into other classes.  If the US is not functioning as an equal society, it’s an aberration of the system.  She’s got some work to do to convince me that “class” even exists in the US.  I will grant that wealth equality is more stark in cities and she is seeing people relate to each other in NYC, so she’s free to present to me what she’s seeing there.  But I think she’s insulting both the “working class” by saying they’re in a lower class bracket they can’t escape without her, and other “classes” by suggesting by virtue of social divisions they don’t “work.”  I tried to start a discussion on this to see what people are seeing that’s different from what I’m seeing in America, but basically people kept replying “of course” America has classes and it’s not up for discussion.  We still all are equal before the law as far as what I see, although the current administration disrespects that traditional value.

"Here's why I wouldn't be worried about those hypotheticals:  While confining ourselves to the US reduces our reasoning to ""what-if"" scenarios, we can look overseas and see that nationalisation has been implemented time and time again, resulting in increased wellbeing for people irrespective of time period, location, gdp, etc etc.   In the real world, the things you are worried about have worked, are currently working, and will probably continue to work in the future.   I can get into the specifics in a future comment, but I just want you to know that nothing beats real-world evidence of failure/success.

In reality he became a top 10 player of all time, possibly the best Red Sox player ever and the only player in the last 70 years to hit .400. And the cherry on top: he never stopped doing that hitch. Modern biomechanics etc is finally catching up and realising that hitches aren't as bad as we thought. In other words it was the ***conventional theory of the time that was wrong***, and had to catch up to what we saw in reality.

There are also still tariffs in effect on Mexico and Canada. I believe the White House has said they are planning to implement additional tech/pharmaceutical tariffs as well. The fed has stated they want to see a bit of the impact before they cut rates. I think a rate cut or two are in the cards this year if there is not a significant impact to price levels as you believe.   Seems like the federal reserve as a whole is being prudent. There is no guarantee that the stockpiling many businesses and individuals have done is sufficient to offset additional import costs from tariffs.

"I say this as a moderate Democrat who despises the current Republican Party and like some things that progressive advocate for.  Progressives are taking the wrong message from the last election by going even MORE progressive.  California is taking active measures to address Uber progressives and I think progressives and other states need to take notice.  California has moved to an open primary system about 6-8 years ago.   The state republicans are weak and the trend to win was for democrats to become even MORE progressive, win the primary and coast to victory.  It was breeding too many folks who were drinking the progressive cool aid so the party did something about it.  An open primary system is a good way to jettison folks from either party that become extreme.  The way it works is that all primaries are done at the same time … on the same ballot and the top two candidates run off against each other meaning a weak republican will get nocked out and a stronger and likely less extreme democratic would run against the progressive.  It’s working.    People have been talking about how San Franciscans are moving to the right … when in fact, I think it was already too far to the left but voters had no real option as the Republican Party was fielding boneheads who drink the MAGA  cool aid.  NOW you’re getting better candidates as they can ignore the wacky fringe voters and go right for the middle majority.  California is now swinging back to become more moderate and you can see the results already in San Francisco.  Something similar needs to be done in other states … open primary or rank voting I think are great options.

">Obama was perceived to the the more liberal option than Hillary Clinton and he won.  I don't recall that being true. I remember Clinton being to the left of Obama in 2008. The unions were pro-Clinton, Clinton was against insurance freeloading, Clinton had the stronger anti-poverty stance, Clinton was more skeptical of bipartisanship. If you look at their Senate voting records, that matches my recollection - Obama was slightly to the right of Clinton.  Obama did run as an anti-establishment figure and was a fresher face. But doing that meant distancing himself a bit from the perceived 'core' of the Democratic party - Obama really sold himself on this belief that a bipartisan consensus was possible, that he would be a unifying figure after the division under Bush. And in primary polling, Obama supporters were also more likely to list themselves as independents, so he appeared to succeed in getting that sort of support.  Clinton also had the authorisation for Iraq on her record. But in simple left-right economic terms, Clinton ran (and voted) to Obama's left.",just_helping,2025-04-20T23:41:29,2
"Last November they did the complete opposite of confidence. A  party that drops out mid race to put someone else in will never win an election ever. Republican or Democrat. But if you think the Democrats handled everything perfectly last year I don't know what to tell yah. Personally I think Biden should have stayed in. He was by far the most progressive president ever that only got screwed by a pandemic and then a pandemic of morons saying it was his fault. But the Democrats themselves divided us when a lot were pressuring Biden to drop out. They sowed a seed of doubt in not only the general public eyes but Democrats themselves were saying Biden was bad but Kamala would be good. I assume you're a social democratic or at least something along those lines. We need to stick together like the Republicans and back the candidate that most aligns with our views.   I bring all this up because a lot of Democrats especially pro Palestinian Democrats voted for jill stein or simply didn't vote at all. And most of the regular non political types actually bought into the fact that trump will be better for the economy. The only reason that happened was because Democrats simply did not do a good job bringing up the struggles every day Americans face. Which is what trump did. He said America was struggling and he will fix it. The Democrats were too worried about poll numbers and look what happened.   You brought up Kennedy, Clinton, and Obama. Why did they win. Because the outline of their campaign was that America was broken and they would fix it. Seems eerily similar to maga. The people of America don't want to be charmed. They want to see their everyday life be improved. And the Republicans got that message out way better than the chaos of the democratic party. Kamala was to focused on saying how she comes from a working class family. That her family was living pay check to pay check. WHO CARES. How are you going to help me and my family which was a question that Kamala and the Democrats rarely answers last year.   The Democrats think if they bring up universal healthcare or affordable housing that somehow the people will not vote for them and that's the real issue with the democratic party.

"I voted for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020 primaries, however he did not have the most votes after all 50 states did their primary voting.

">Your last paragraph is totally false. Black men do not respond to left-wing populist activist candidates like Bernie. Bernie did horrible amongst them both times he ran in the primaries. Bernie would’ve gotten devastated against Trump in 2016 or 2020 because he turns off working class culturally right of center voters even more than Kamala/biden/hillary  Those primaries were against candidates close to Obama. The argument is whether AOC can measure up against Donald Trump.  And poll after poll showed that Bernie absolutely could have.  >Bernie’s theory of the case has literally never proven out to be true. He has a white young politically engaged base that will always turn out no matter what.   What does this even prove? That his core base is educated white people? And?

I think the environment we have at the moment is people are understandably angry at the current state of the economy, the current state of the world. And when they saw Democrats rightfully standing up for transgender rights, there was this disconnect. ‘Why do they care about them when I can’t even afford to give my kids school lunch, etc’ I think in societies with this level of income inequality, this kind of anger and resentment builds until it inevitably pours over into hatred and bigotry, a scapegoat. Democrats really need to meet the moment here. If they keep on fielding candidates that are milquetoast, uninspiring neoliberals, they will continue to lose.

"Kamala Harris was a very weak candidate.

(Secure the Southern border and voting rights.)  She was such a terrible VP that about 18 months before the election there was very public rumblings being leaked by some Democrats that she should be removed from the ticket.  And then Biden quits under pressure from not only Republicans but his own party.  And the DNC hands the keys to Kamala Harris?  They should have had an open convention.  At least then they could say that the nominee was democratically picked.    Bottom line, that was what killed Kamala Harris.  She just wasn't fit for the job.

"A few things on this:  1. I would agree with you under any other circumstance. However, Donald Trump promised to lower prices ""on day one,"" and his followers repeated that over, and over, and over, that Trump will fix it. Now that he predictably hasn't fixed it and things are getting even worse, suddenly the economy and cost of living actually wasn't that important anyway, they say.   2. Joe Biden wasn't afforded this same grace when he was president. When things were expensive because of covid recovery, supply chain issues, bird flu, etc., nobody bailed him out by saying ""Hey guys, I know it sucks but actually inflation tends to rise every year and we had a pandemic, so it's no big deal!"". That argument is *ONLY* used now to protect Trump (not saying you're doing that, I'm just saying in general).   3. I want to push back on the notion that his actions haven't contributed to things getting worse. They absolutely have.   At the beginning of 2025, Moody's predicted a 1.7% growth of the US economy for this year. After not even half a year of Trump's term, that forecast is now 0.8%.

"The problem is you have made some incredible assumptions based on your own preferences. Bernie is not popular. He lost in 2016 and then lost even worse in 2020 when superdelegates were taken out of the equation, all this while continuing to push his ‘sincere’ agenda. That’s reality  If Bernie was popular he would have been the nominee, yet not only has he not become the nominee in two primaries, he has managed to get worst results his second time around",HiSno,2025-04-20T14:31:15,5

Mandating people pay for something they may not want was considered a left leaning position compared to no mandate at the time. As with most left leaving positions it was better policy but more difficult to message.,Gnagus,2025-04-20T14:26:55,3
If you have 100 voters you will get 100 different definitions. That’s how it works. Several comments have stated that Obama ran on a centrist platform during his first campaign. Others will disagree and that’s ok.,repeatoffender123456,2025-04-20T10:37:56,2

"Bernie Sanders has [higher net favorability](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52037-what-americans-think-of-120-political-leaders) than any politician in America other than Barack Obama. He is incredibly popular for how well known he is. That doesn’t mean people agree with him or would vote for him, but generally people *like* him.   Using the democratic primary process as a metric of popularity is a fundamentally flawed proposition due to its structure and the variety of incentives experienced by the voters and the candidates.",Polyodontus,2025-04-20T15:02:23,0
"LOL  Insane to think that elections - especially the last 2 - are not decided by close margins within districts.  If Kamala still wanted to be thought of as a liberal senator and not a corpo freak, she wouldn't have:  a) campaigned with Liz Cheney b) courted and appeased billionaires & corporations  c) had centrist bullshit messaging that no one could really talk about or debate reasonably d) said that she wouldn't do anything differently than Biden e) given the same speech multiple times a day for weeks like some kind of robot f) walked back her statements on trans people  g) employed Mark Cuban to be some kind of salesperson for her  h) allowed the DNC and Biden's awful campaign managers to cripple her and Walz  i) tried to get the Republican vote  j) pretended that the economy was strong and somehow working for poor people.  k) taken an actual stand on the genocide in Gaza  I'm sure there are more examples.   Face it. Your corpo freak Democrat candidates are dead and done. They ran Kamala and honestly seemed to want her to lose, tainting her record & turning her into exactly what they thought she should be. Not that she should have won, anyway, with the way she couldn't even be assed to talk to her supporters the night she lost and now comes out laughing at people who are in pain.",siat-s,2025-04-23T13:18:46,0

"I get what you're saying, but I vehemently disagree with the notion that it was more difficult to message. Maybe for cowards (not calling you one).  From just arguing the merits. ""We all pay for roads we might, maybe never drive on, schools we might, maybe never go to. Why? Because those that DO use it benefit you. Roads means people go to work, economy good. Schools mean people are smart. Democracy good, economy good, arts good etc. Everyone pays into Healthcare means people can live longer to DO all that stuff. Everything I just said and more, good.""   Or just the technocratic ""more healthy people paying into the system lowers the risk pool, makes it easier to argue with your doctors for lower prices, keeps it cheap for everyone. This isn't even socialism. It's simple economics. If we want affordable Healthcare. we ALL have to do our part.""  And to counter the idea that it's somehow more ideologically left-wing.

"No. They're wrong. Voters don't vote based on the platform. They vote based on vibes, the narrative. All the policies do is supplement the narrative.   You can sell murdering puppies if you convince people that its necessary to give them healthcare. People unironically see Trump as a moderate but not Kamala, even when it's decidedly the opposite.

This is one that actually shows net favorability. The other one doesn’t. And my point isn’t that he could win the presidential election. I don’t know if he could and it doesn’t matter because he won’t run again. My point is that *people like sincere politicians* more than they like “moderates” with no conviction.   People keep giving democratic politicians the same sort of advice you are giving and they just keep getting less and less popular and keep fucking losing because nobody thinks they have any principles.,Polyodontus,2025-04-20T17:52:10,1

"Biden won largely due to the contingency built into the primary system, which is sequential rather than synchronous, extremely path dependent, and easily influenced by donors, locally powerful political actors, and party leadership. Primary voters also have competing incentives to pick the candidate that best reflects their preferences and also the candidate most likely to win in the general.
