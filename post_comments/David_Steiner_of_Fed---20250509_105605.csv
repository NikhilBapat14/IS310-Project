Republican scum have wanted the postal service privatized for decades and they just might get away with it this time.,Wulfbrir,2025-05-09T11:07:16,24
"Yeah, this should go well.    I'll say this for the 1000th time.  THE US POSTAL SERVICE IS A ***SERVICE*** NOT A BUSINESS.  IT SHOULD NOT BE PROFITABLE AS IT'S A *SERVICE* TO THE US PEOPLE.  Reliable, secure, and AFFORDABLE mail service was considered so important that the USPS was created in 1775, before the United States was even a country.   In fact Ben Franklin didn't feel that we could have a truly democratic country without the ability to get news and information to everyone in the country safely and affordably.  And he was correct.  And one of the key tenants of it was that it should cost the same to mail a letter across the street or across the country so that things like news could be sent to the furthest reaches of the country.  It was created to level the playing field for all Americans so that even the poorest could afford to send mail and not just the wealthy as it had been prior.  If you've never priced out FedEx to send a letter you should go give it a shot.  You'll find they charge 10x what the Post Office does for lesser service.",No_Size9475,2025-05-09T11:13:16,28

"The right's been trying to get rid of the USPS for decades.  It now has Captain Brazen leading the charge by appointing Steiner.  It's all happening out in the open now.  We're witnessing the deconstruction and diminishment of the USA one agency, one policy, and one international relationship at a time.",sedawkgrepper,2025-05-09T11:18:32,2

"He will pull away all the profitable, competing products to FedEx and leave the USPS with the unsustainable daily mail delivery. I think the real damage will be to the unions. FedEx has never been union friendly and does a major part of their business using subcontractors. It’s in their DNA. When Fred Smith was CEO the second time, during the 2008 presidential election, he sent an email to company employees that he wasn’t telling them who to vote for but to let them know that if it became easier to organize - an Obama platform - he would fire them all to be replaced by contractors.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-09T12:10:09,2
I wish Scott Steiner would be the new postal service leader.,SalParadise79,2025-05-09T16:21:54,2
"He was on the FedEx board, that is it. He was the CEO of Waste Management before that. He did say the USPS was an ""independent establishment of the executive branch."" which is correct.  We will see how independent. So far all of Lord Dampnut's picks have been have been at best duds, if not dangerous, so my hopes aren't high.  But Coming from an actually successful company and being on FedEx's board may not be a bad thing.",ianrl337,2025-05-09T11:05:52,2

"I’m 100% against this and completely support the USPS but let’s be real, who the fuck is mailing letters for legitimate informational/personal purposes? Maybe holiday cards but like personal letters, really?  My mailbox is ALWAYS full of shit that goes immediately into recycling. The amount of paper and ink wasted on junk mail and the energy for printing and then recycling it has to be tremendous.  Edit - additionally, it’s pretty likely junk mail continues to exist because it IS sooo fucking cheap to mail it.",Ok_Investigator_3788,2025-05-09T12:08:58,-1
