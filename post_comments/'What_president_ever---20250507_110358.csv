We are in this mess because of Biden. If he held Trump and all of the J6 co conspirators accountable we wouldn't be teetering on the fall of democracy right now.   On top of that if he would have kept his word and only run for one term there could have been an actual primary and a full campaign to help combat the glaringly obvious anti-incumbent environment across the globe in 2024.   His words now mean nothing and frankly fall drastically short of the moment. Trump is talking about annexing our biggest ally and Biden's response is to wag a finger at him and attempt to shame him. All US politicians and former politicians should be calling for impeachment and stating it plainly that Donald Trump is an enemy of America and its people. ,dchambers22,2025-05-07T11:24:19,6

"You have no way of knowing that. The DNC exists more to prevent leftward movement than anything else—the last time the DNC pushed someone DemSoc leaning, they had to amend the constitution to stop him from winning elections.  Big Capital runs both parties here—if someone ran on FDR policy, they would win the general election. It's the one thing the DNC won't try, because it'll piss off their donor-class base.",pleachchapel,2025-05-07T17:29:07,1

"I 100% hold Trump, the heritage foundation, and Maga supporters responsible for what is going on. That doesn't mean that I can't acknowledge that Trump was only eligible for reelection because Biden fell short of his duty to protect the United States from a domestic threat. He even classified Trump as such before the election, and yet he let four years go by where he did nothing to protect the country from executive overreach after his own certification was almost thwarted by an insurrection.   As for the unwillingness of Americans to do anything, there have been large protests at least once a month that get coverage for a day or two and fade away. Our courts have been overturning illegal executive orders as fast as they can, but are under water as Trump floods the zone. I absolutely understand that we could be doing more, but until the outrage reaches a critical mass there is very little people in blue states can do to actually affect change, and we need our elected representatives to have enough backbone to standup for the principles we are shouting about back home. Intead they are confirming cabinent members that are woefully unqualified, approving continuing resolutions that solidify the illegal tariffs based on fictitious emergencies, and refusing to force votes on issues that gets representatives on the record supporting this chaos so when midterms are finally here the 36% of the populace that was too apathetic to vote in the last election believes something good could actually come of voting instead of just continuing the 40 year death march where we hand power back and forth between facist republicans that push us towards a technocratic or theocratic police state depending on which side of the Mason Dixon line you live on and neo-liberals that pull back on the reigns ever so slightly but make no meaningful change to better people's lives or prevent additional power grabs.    To start his term Biden had control of the house and senate but did nothing to overturn Citizen's United, support abortion rights, stop insider trading in congress, or expand the supreme court after two seats were effectively stolen from democratic presidents. I wish more people would vote, but I understand why someone making less than a livable wage would succumb to apathy and rhetoric that both sides are the same when all they can see is economic disparity widening and their elected representatives acting in their own self interest taking bribes from lobbyists instead of representing thier constituents. ",dchambers22,2025-05-07T13:43:38,6

"It's super frustrating because his policies for the most part were beneficial, he passed the largest infrastructure bill since the New Deal, stood on picket lines with workers, and managed a relatively soft landing coming out of covid. All that happened when congress was as divided as it's ever been.   His legacy could have been being viewed as one of the best presidents, but because of his own ego his legacy will be the scorched earth Trump leaves behind. Heard today the plan is to sell public lands to pay for the tax breaks, and that's just one more thing that we will never get back. ",dchambers22,2025-05-07T12:48:16,5

"The damage Biden did was through inaction and disruption to the election cycle. He watched our democracy almost get ripped apart but did nothing to shore the safeguards up in case he lost, and then attempted to run again when he was in no position to effectively campaign which led to a 90 day blitz where Harris apparently had herself trailing in polls the whole way and was told by Biden not to distance herself from him even though the population was furious with him and even as I write all this I admit that the reasons the population was unhappy were largely unfounded as there was very little Biden could do to curb inflation more than he did.",dchambers22,2025-05-07T13:49:34,3
