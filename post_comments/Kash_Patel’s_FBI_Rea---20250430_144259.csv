Pettiness on full display. Can’t do actual work so they decide to do theatre instead.,FAMUgolfer,2025-04-30T14:53:34,50
"Do minority MAGA folks actually believe that racist white MAGA likes them? I mean seriously, how dumb can you be?",akd432,2025-04-30T15:06:25,18
"What about the one guy in the back who took a lazy knee? I mean I would probably do it that way too since I have knee problems, but he could probably argue that he wasn't fully invested in it if he wanted too. :p",Rusalka-rusalka,2025-04-30T16:56:16,3
He's actually stupid.  There were plenty of examples of cops who did this and then immediately started brutalizing and arresting people afterwards.  Thank God for this regime's unmitigated incompetence.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-30T15:18:06,4

Such an important action when the economy is cratering ,Gator1508,2025-04-30T15:55:21,1
so basicly firing those that sides with innocent george floyd thus encouraging police brutality again,saiyanscaris,2025-04-30T17:27:23,1
You mean the ones who acknowledged this was a racially driven murder? Got it!,LostmydadtoCOVID,2025-04-30T19:42:00,1
So a guy that took a knee for the wrong reason is going after someone that did it for the right reason?,fastcatdog,2025-04-30T20:23:39,1
"Why? I think this is probably the question and answer to everything that happens in this administration. Just like if 45 would have invested his money, he would have been wealthier, in the same way if he had just left everything alone after biden and just take the credit, we'd be doing fine. But no, he needed to muck everything up with tariffs, doge, making a show of deportations, leaving WHO, etc. The whole administration has been weaponized for absolutely no reason at all!!!",I-WishIKnew,2025-04-30T15:08:49,1
Wouldn’t want anyone thinking gir themselves huh.,togocann49,2025-04-30T14:46:06,0
Petty and a waste of time. Imagine being the agents tasked with looking through photo archives then finding the identities of people who took a knee at a BLM protest like 5+ years ago.,Bruce-7891,2025-04-30T14:55:53,18
"There's always some token that's kept around as sideshow so the rich and authoritarian can think along the lines of ""See the good we do, we even gave one of 'them' a spot"". Patel would like to be one of those tokens,",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T15:12:05,13
"Conservative media shows there’s always nazi money for tokens. Not respect, not really safety, but at least you get some money before they spit in your face.",daggity,2025-04-30T18:04:40,3
"""I think I know these two, sir, we busted a human trafficking ring together.""   ""Okay, put them in the demotion pile. Next.""",True_Paper_3830,2025-04-30T15:00:02,8
I get what you are saying but it's such weak behavior on the part of Patel. Why would you want to join an organization that doesn't like you? Have some self respect.,akd432,2025-04-30T15:26:24,5
That’s why he “works” remotely from Vegas,stjohns_jester,2025-04-30T16:16:05,6
Authoritarians would rather be under a boot and call that person colleague than accept they are part of the out group for the ruling fascists.,TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T15:30:20,3
