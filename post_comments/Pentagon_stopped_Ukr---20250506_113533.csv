It is sooo embarrassing that North Korea is a better ally to Russia than we are to Ukraine.,Super-Bodybuilder-91,2025-05-06T11:40:06,21
"Republicans liked saying ""who's even in charge?"" when Biden was president.  With Trump the question is ""is anyone actually in charge?"".",epicredditdude1,2025-05-06T11:48:47,14
"I think we will find that Trump isn't actually directing anything and all these people in all these departments are doing what they want to because that was the promise he gave them for the support of the Far Right and billionaires. He just wants his 100 million dollar parades and free golf trips and dumb press conferences about the NFL. There's no real unifying strategy. Just absolute chaos, rubberstamped by the Republican party who are praying they can stop elections somehow.",katyadc,2025-05-06T11:55:29,9
"This is plausibly true but I would offer a different theory. Trump recognizes that he isn't going to be able to get Putin to sign a deal. He recognizes that knifing Ukraine in the back as publicly as he did did not go over well and is a fault-line with the Republican coalition. He also wants to get rid of Pete Hegeseth for a variety of reasons. I see this as more likely palace politics to kill two birds with one stone. Pin Trump's early fiascos in Ukraine on Pete, get rid of Pete. Never liked Pete but it's pretty clear from Trump's statements that he wanted to cut aid to Ukraine. This I think is a bit of political revisionism now that Trump realized some amount of Ukraine aid was necessary to cool down congress (behind the scenes the aid suspension to Ukraine caused a bit of shitshow in the house that Vance was unable to blackmail away: Brian Fitzpatrick, Don Bacon, and I think Joe West basically threatened to openly break on party-line votes for things like the budget  probably a few others behind the scenes but those are the ones I know of) and I think Trump reversed course a bit on being as publicly anti-Ukraine as he was when he started seeing some difficult to overcome resistance within his own party over this.",somethingicanspell,2025-05-06T11:54:29,5
Doubt. Putin's check cleared... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-06T12:11:25,1
"Knowing how vicious and vindictive Trump is, it's not credible to claim that he didn't know about the pause.  No lackey in his right mind would take that sort of risk.  It's an age-old tactic: tell a subordinate to do something, then claim ""I had no idea"".",nogooduse,2025-05-06T19:08:27,1

"I go back and forth on whether Trump is a buffoon or a political animal, probably somewhere in between but regardless if it's accidental or not  he is very good at palace politics. No one since LBJ has ever dominated his party and underlings to the extent Trump has.",somethingicanspell,2025-05-06T12:31:16,1
"I don’t think he’s good. I think he’s sucking off so many rich people that others want to suck him off in hopes of catching some remnants kind of like a voluntary form of the movie “Human Centipede.” I think those who surround him know just how much of a tool he is and how easy it can be to stroke his ego, and thereby get what they want out of him…. Which let’s be honest here, those with money, want more money, and Trump is in a position to pillage the people and redistribute to the poor. I can see all the tariffs coming in paying for his next tax break for the rich.",CAFritoBandito,2025-05-06T12:42:14,1
