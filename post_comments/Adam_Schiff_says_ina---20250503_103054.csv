"You won't find someone as anti-gun as i am, and I agree with him, but this is just not the right time to pursue this. The country has literally been taken over by terrorists. I wish even a single democrat would begin acting like it. ",Bakedads,2025-05-03T10:35:23,22

"Adam Schiff picked his opposition by boosting the Republican candidate. The California primary is nonpartisan, Republicans and Democrats are on the same ballot. The Republican candidate didn’t campaign much, didn’t spend any money on television ads. Why would a Schiff super-PAC buy ads on Fox News saying this Republican is “too conservative”?",JewsieJay,2025-05-03T16:04:49,3

"In an open primary, no candidate is obligated to only campaign against your preferred candidate.  All he did was campaign against the person polling in second place, which makes perfect sense.
