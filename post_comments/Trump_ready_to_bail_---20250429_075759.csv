Why not students with loans?  The farmers did this to themselves too,MissionCreeper,2025-04-29T07:58:47,49
So our taxes are going to farmers because of Trump's tariffs. Again. It's the same thing he did last time to tune of around $38 billion. This time will be worse. What a shell game. Each new cog in the wheel allows for another form of grift. We're getting fleeced.,1900grs,2025-04-29T08:01:39,17
"Farmers coming back to the government with their hands out yet again. Biggest beneficiaries of socialism in this country and with zero shame, too.  You support this administration but want none of the responsibility for when things inevitably go south? That's on you for voting for it, supporting it, and still not learning your lesson.  Here's an idea. Instead of growing a single product in such a large surplus that you have to sell to China, how about you diversify and grow things that can be consumed in America? You know, make America great again or something.  I'm so tired of farmers pretending to be the victim of their own actions.",thistimelineisweird,2025-04-29T08:11:35,19
I thought the overriding sentiment with the GOP is that government handouts are only for lazy people who don't want to work or got themselves into a situation of their own choosing.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-29T08:06:41,9

"I 100% called it. Tariffs will punish farmers and the US will simply use money from tariffs to bail them out.   This whole thing is a stupid joke. What a clown.   To be fair, I don't want farmers to suffer. I think it's honorable what they do to feed America and others in the world. I just think it's disgraceful that these tariffs exist in the first place.",ibeerianhamhock,2025-04-29T09:15:09,5

"Of course he will. COVID ended up being their best year they got so many handouts.   Funny he is so mad at China for subsidizing so we consumers get cheaper product, then wants other countries to buy subsidized (with US tax dollars) US AG products. Oh, and don't forget the auto bailout. Tell me, did we get cheaper vehicles?  (note, just went down the auto bailout rabbithole and Bush used EO to divert TARP funds to automakers)    Oh, if it's not hypocrisy, it's not Republican. :)",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-29T08:17:12,3

Trump is ready to bailout EXPORT farmers. The farmers who actually feed us probably won't get much help.  [Great Video on the topic by Dr. Sarah Taber.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1GVWpe6e_U),aaprillaman,2025-04-29T12:45:44,3
"As the article says, farmers want market and trade certainty, not bailouts.      Dems' message should be exactly that. The return of a normalized and mature global  trading order, based on an understanding of markets - the capitalist solution. Not that the dems were never capitalist, but the pubs did suck the oxygen out of that room rhetorically. Now they just sucked the oxygen out of their own lungs, and it's an opportunity.",steve_ample,2025-04-29T08:02:42,4

I wonder which of those groups is traditionally conservative.,Bronsonkills,2025-04-29T08:02:20,25
Even worse than that is that they are planning to just give the farmers money but not require the farmers to keep growing food as a result.  So the farmers are just going to take this money and then let their fields go fallow for a few years.  While the poor stupid fucks who are paying the bills starved to death.,Deinosoar,2025-04-29T08:04:49,16

"A couple reasons they keep getting bailed out; they do actually make a commodity we can't live without, and corporate farm lobbies are huge. As that a reason for them to vote against their own self interest? No, but it's why every president cares to keep that industry afloat.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T08:22:27,2
">Instead of growing a single product in such a large surplus that you have to sell to China...  It has nothing to do with a surplus and everything to do with being it being comparatively simple to grow bulk amounts of certain crops (corn, soy, and tobacco) on massive farms for the express purpose of export.   They have zero interest in growing food for the US consumer because it's more work.",aaprillaman,2025-04-29T12:52:28,1
"How much do you like eating..?   Farming is subsidized by the fed in both parties because it is inherently risk-prone and low-profit, but necessary.    The trouble in this mess is Trump will have a say over which farms receive what—and you can bet it won't be the little guys holding land from big ag's acquisition.",Excellent-Notice2928,2025-04-29T08:16:48,-5

"Pretty sure that tariffs are the one thing he remembers from whatever little of his education that he was sort of paying attention to.  So, his brain grasps onto it as tightly as it can, and anything economics, he immediately retorts with “tariffs!”  But, because he wasn’t really paying attention, he didn’t learn about what they were, how they work, their consequences, etc.  And thus, throwing around tariffs because that’s all he can sort of remember from his Econ classes.",NubEnt,2025-04-29T09:40:31,4

"I’m not stupid enough to give out personal information on Reddit but “10 hours a week raising a small flock of sheep” sounds more like a non-essential hobby (you initially said farmers work 20 hours a week and you admit you do half that). It doesn’t sounds like you rely on farming as your livelihood. It sounds like you have an inflated sense of importance and what you’re doing, and a totally warped view of what farming is and what it actually entails.",hahabobby,2025-04-29T09:08:07,3
"No, I'm just not a dumb ass that thinks modern tractors, computers and all the information system used on a farm just fall out of the sky. Or do you think they should go back to pulling plows with an ox? Then driving it to market yourself with a horse and a cart?  This doesn't even include food safety guidelines, health care for people, vet care for animals, and all the logistics that go into farming. Ironic you think the guy driving the tractor is a straight genius, the people harvesting the crops need to be deported, and everyone else that makes modern production and distribution possible are useless.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T09:10:37,1

"It's notoriously hard and stressful work because you have good years and bad years sometimes. If it was really just 10-20 hours a week with enough money to live comfortably, most people would be farming as a side gig.
