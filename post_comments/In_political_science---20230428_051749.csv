"Former Poly Sci major here.  In Political Science, ""Government"" refers to the actual people in charge. It's similar to how we use the word ""administration"" in the United States. The Government is the President or Prime Minister and their cabinet, or the King and their advisors, etc. The ""government changes"" when a different group of people comes into power. So in the United States, every 4-8 years.  The State is hard to define, but in this context, it refers to what the ""government"" (the people in charge) are in charge of.  A Government collapses when the people in charge lose their authority (this can't really happen in an American-style presidential system. The terminology comes from a parliamentary system where the Prime Minister and Cabinet can be removed at any time). A State collapses when the State cannot do the things that the Government oversees (collect taxes, enforce laws, defend borders, etc.).The second quote simply means that as long as the State exists, someone is in charge. In a well-functioning state, there is never a power vacuum. If a government collapses, it is immediately replaced with another Government. So while a specific Government may end, if there is no Government whatsoever, then the State has collapsed.  Looking at an undergrad Intro to Comparative Politics textbook might be helpful. They're dry but usually pretty clear and have a glossary.",loselyconscious,2023-04-30T03:38:16,6
"I'm not sure where the statements are coming from, but I don't think they are two statements from the same text talking about the same thing. There's as many ways to define state and government as there are people coming up with definitions, so if you mix and match them too much it's going to sound weird",Blear,2023-04-28T08:54:39,3
"Governments come and go, but states have staying power. The regime of Moammar Qaddafi collapsed in 2011, but the State of Libya, although battered and fragile, remains. Libya still has the same borders as it did 20 years ago, and there are still people living there who identify as ""Libyans.""  As far as the four elements of the state, I vaguely remember those from HS government. 2 of them are sovereignty and territory.",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-04-28T15:03:39,2
"Neither are actual truisms. Both are statements made by people who think they get how things really are. If it doesn't make sense, it's because it doesn't make sense.  In terms of passing your polisci class, the gist of it that the state is an entity that needs a government to function, but the government can change without the state changing.   It's like saying a car needs tires, but you keep the car and replace the tires. You don't buy a new car with new tire, and new tires don't make a new car. Is it a dumb statement? Sure it is. Is it an accurate description of states and governments? I don't think so. Do you need to know it to pass polisci. Probably.",nerdygeekwad,2023-04-28T19:41:04,2
States end. Poland was an example. Where is Prussia? Or Byzantium?,Usual_Ad2359,2023-04-29T09:57:14,1
"I think they are both coming from Political Science textbooks. Poli Sci (as with a lot of academic departments) will try to create its own vocabulary for consistency's sake, but then it diverges from actual uses leaving undergraduates perpetually confused.   The second quote, I'm assuming, is a paraphrase. If you put it in context, then it is using the same meaning of government (essentially, how Americans use the word ""administration""). What is trying to be said is that so long as the state exists, someone will be in charge of the executive branch. An administration may end, but it will immediately be replaced with another. If it's not, that is called State Collapse.",loselyconscious,2023-04-30T03:45:06,2

"Not intentionally. This statement is meant to contrast “state” and “government” for American students, who general use the terms interchangeably. It isn’t meant to mean that states never end.",Polyodontus,2023-04-30T09:00:52,3
"States are a fairly modern concept, and a lot of older ""countries"" wouldn't be considered states by modern standards.",Naliamegod,2023-05-05T22:07:45,1
">Belgium often manages for long periods of time without government  But what is really meant by that is that there is a caretaker Government. There is still a Prime Minister and Cabinet; they just are ""transitional"" and have limited power. Just adding this for the Americans who don't understand Parliamentary systems",loselyconscious,2023-04-30T03:40:52,3
