Yet another violent criminal that the left has turned into some kind of martyr.   Very embarrassing.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-02T09:10:17,137
One of two things happens here:  1) they go silent on this guy and leave him in El Salvador and suddenly no longer care  2) they double down and try to ignore and bury this inconvenient footage and continue to use the ‚Äúdue process‚Äù mantra for an illegal non-citizen gang member who already got due process,ITrCool,2025-05-02T09:47:00,83
"While Abrego-Garcia has been alleged to be an MS-13 member from the beginning of this story due to some very compelling evidence, more recently, it was revealed that his wife also took out multiple restraining orders against him after he allegedly beat her. Then there was a traffic stop in 2022 where the now-deported illegal immigrant was suspected of human trafficking. That's where this newly released body cam footage comes into play  Fox News Bill Melugin obtained the video from the Tennessee Highway Patrol. It shows police confronting Abrego-Garcia after he was pulled over while driving a convicted human smuggler's car. In the vehicle were eight other people, none of whom appeared to have any real connection with him. He was also carrying $1400 in cash, which the officers suspected was his payment.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T09:50:48,58

Meaning he joined or ranked up in the gangs recently....",Impossible_Dirt_535,2025-05-02T13:02:55,12

"I don‚Äôt get it, all these deportations.. all these cops shooting good innocent people.. why do they pick the worst examples?? Or, are these the best people they could find? Guessing the latter.   Imagine traveling to El Salvador to meet with a human trafficker. How do you look your constituents in the eye after that?",chillthrowaways,2025-05-04T19:46:31,2
