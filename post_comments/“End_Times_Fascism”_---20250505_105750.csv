Well one thing is clear.   The Republicans in Congress don't believe in the future. They clearly do not expect that we are going to have an election in 2026 because if they did they wouldn't be sitting there pretending nothing is happening at the White House.    I've been getting called a doomer and a demoralizer for telling people here on Reddit/Politics that I don't expect we're going to have a free and fair election in 2026.    But I consider the utter indifference and lack of concern about Trump by Republicans in Congress to be evidence for my thesis that they don't expect they will face any contest in their reelection.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T16:44:55,7

"Naomi Klein herself has something to say about your characterization.   https://www.democracynow.org/2023/9/14/naomi_klein_doppelganger  ""I am perennially confused and conflated with another writer named Naomi, Naomi Wolf, and having that identity confusion is an extreme form of uncanniness, because what becomes unfamiliar is you. You see people and hear people talking about you, but it’s not you. It’s very destabilizing. So I thought, “Well, this is an interesting technique.” And she really is less the subject of the book than a literary technique to get into these other kinds of uncanny forces. Should I tell the bathroom story, Amy? ... ""I was at a march through the Financial District at the height of Occupy Wall Street. And like other people at that march, I needed to use a public restroom. And I was in one of these skyscrapers, and I don’t remember exactly which building. But while in the restroom, I overheard a couple of people talking about me, being quite unkind, I must say, Amy. They were sort of drawling, like, “Did you read that article by Naomi Klein? Oh my god, she really doesn’t understand our movement. She doesn’t understand our demands.” And I was sort of frozen in fear. It brought back all of my terrible high school memories, you know, these mean girls who were talking about me.  ""But as I listened, I realized, “Oh, they’re not talking about me. They’re talking about somebody else.” So I came out of the stall, and I met one of their eyes, and I said words that I have had to say, unfortunately, too many times: “I think you’re talking about Naomi Wolf.” But in the end, that became quite fitting to me, because I think when we overhear people speaking about us on social media, we essentially are just reading the graffiti on the bathroom wall, which is not healthy, and we probably should stop doing that. So I think it’s fitting that the first time I became aware of the identity confusion in the real world, it was actually literally in a bathroom. ... ""Well, this is a little tricky to say, because I do write — I don’t think this gives people a pass, but Wolf is one of these people who has experienced a lot of shaming and kind of pile-ons on left Twitter, or liberal Twitter, or X, or whatever it’s called. She’s really been, I would say, internet-bullied. People can say, “OK, well, for good reason. She’s spread conspiracies. She has made major factual errors in her books.” But I don’t think that’s necessarily a justification for cruelty. So I think that’s something else that gets magnified, because I think when people have an experience that is very, very negative in left or liberal circles, where they really get treated almost like they’re not human — and that’s partly because they’re performing themselves as a brand, which is saying, “Hey, I’m out here, I’m a commodity, I’m a thing,” and then people start thinking, “Well, if you’re a thing, I can throw things at you, and you won’t bleed” — you know, I think that that’s part of what is magnified here, and that becomes a justification for, I think, an unjustifiable political alliance with extremely dangerous figures who are building a network of far-right political parties, who take issues like rightful suspicion of Big Pharma, rightful anger at Big Tech, rightful anger at the elites, and flip it to transphobia, xenophobia, racism. And here I’m thinking about figures like Giorgia Meloni, who is a protégé of Steve Bannon’s. ... ""[W]hen I would confess to people I knew that I was working on this book, sometimes I would get this strange reaction like, “Well, why would you give [Wolf] attention?” And there was this sense that because she was no longer visible in the pages of The New York Times or on MSNBC or wherever, and because she had been deplatformed on social media, that — or on the social media that we’re on — that she just didn’t exist. And there was this assumption that we, whoever “we” are, are in control of the attention, and so if the spigot gets turned off, then there’s no more attention.""  I think the main take-away is that in not seeing these people as people, we can alienate them and they will turn to dangerous movements because they feel seen/heard in them by design. These movements are designed to take those who feel alienated by the left and turn them into right-wing extremists. As Klein herself says, it's tricky, because you don't wanna give people who say/do dangerous things a pass, but at the same time, you don't want to alienate them by dehumanizing them, for example by talking cruelly about them. Maybe it's the views that should be targeted, rather than the people. It's hard though. Just something to consider.",senextelex,2025-05-06T11:52:54,2

"Because the job of the dem establishment is to maintain a stable neoliberal status quo. That means serving the donor class, who control the establishment through consultants and lobbyists. There is no incentive to make our lives better unless it aligns with corporate interests too. Any actions the left would have to take to make effective change would threaten the owner class and strip them of power. That means you need massive support from a grassroots base, which the establishment has zero fucking clue how to do and I doubt even cares to. But there's no incentive to even do that if your job is to maintain the status quo. We have to kick all of these old fucks out and inject new blood if we're ever going to stand a chance.",Spanklaser,2025-05-05T11:57:48,21

"> When dems win, they chose to do nothing.  This is in large part why they do not get nearly the turn out.   I reliably vote Dem in every election, but I have no actual hope they'll do anything in power. In fact I am confident they won't. I vote Dem to mitigate the unrelenting, savage harm that conservatives will obviously do, but I don't *want* those to be my only choices.   Trump pumps out the voter turnout because, like it or not, he *does* things. They are horrible, yes, and many illegal, but he's actively using his power to advance his agenda.   That's what we want. Dem voters watched Bush commit 8 years of war crimes, and then had to watch Obama fail to do literally anything meaningful for it.   We watched Trump do incalculable harm for four years, and then watched Biden barely do anything to hold him accountable. He deferred the matter to a tepid, useless AG he put in power who sat on his hands for a year and then shrugged.   And then Biden simply shook Trump's hand in 2024 and gave him the White House.   Why would anyone expect huge turnouts to vote for these losers? What have they done in *decades* to engender literally *any* hope that they'll be effective in any way, shape or form?",StoppableHulk,2025-05-05T12:27:32,12
