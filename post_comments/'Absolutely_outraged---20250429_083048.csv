"> [Chris Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Krebs), the former government cybersecurity leader whom President Donald Trump targeted for investigation for affirming the integrity of the 2020 election, said he was *outraged* Monday at the Trump administration’s gutting of cyber personnel.  > > ... Krebs criticized the second Trump administration for its repeated cuts to cybersecurity employees, contractors and programs.  ""Cybersecurity is national security. ... to see what’s happening to the cybersecurity community inside the federal government, we should be outraged. Absolutely outraged."" > > Since January, the Trump administration has made repeated cuts to cybersecurity personnel. It has directed the agency Krebs helmed during Trump’s first administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to cut probationary employees and advisory committees, and it sent out two rounds of emails encouraging employees to retire.",Tuna_Sushi,2025-04-29T08:44:21,6
