"> A little more than four years after President Donald Trump freed a little-known South Bay businesswoman from prison, a San Diego judge on Friday ordered Adriana Isabel Camberos back into custody, sentencing her to more than a year behind bars for a massive new fraud scheme.  > Chief U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant said Camberos, 54, and her brother Andres “Andy” Camberos, 46, who were convicted last year for a plot in which they sold products destined for Mexico in the more lucrative U.S. market, made tens of millions of dollars based on “a series of lies … (and) elaborate schemes.”  > But the judge said the criminal conduct in the new case, which began just weeks after Trump commuted Adriana’s prior sentence, was less egregious than the scheme that first landed her in prison, since that case involved selling a counterfeit drink.  > Bashant sentenced Adriana Camberos to one year and one day in federal prison in the new case, plus an additional two months in custody for violating her supervised release in her previous case. The judge sentenced Andy Camberos to one year of home detention.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-27T14:08:21,20
