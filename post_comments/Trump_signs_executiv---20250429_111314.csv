Lmao how do you enforce this,Sprinklings,2025-04-29T11:17:49,26

THIS IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT for a CDL license. wtf. Way to take credit for something already there.,Radiant-Surround-544,2025-04-29T11:59:19,4

"Fuck with Truckers, some of the safest people on the roads.  Keep winning Trump.  Making friends everywhere you go.  It is strange.  This administration despises competence on a number of,levels.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-29T11:33:43,3

Doesn‚Äôt he have a long history of slurring and mispronouncing words like Teslurs and covfefe?  Don‚Äôt sound like English to me.  Lock him up!,TheCredibleHulk7,2025-04-29T11:37:08,1
The irony in this is the only truck drivers I‚Äôve meet that don‚Äôt speak English are the ones that come straight from the ports. So those people probably won‚Äôt be working much when nothing is coming into the ports anyways lmao,sneakyguy135,2025-04-29T12:34:36,1
Lol so essentially shutting down the industry.,throwaway4251960,2025-04-29T11:27:41,0
"One step closer to a Depression.  Right now we have ports without container ships coming in.  So once the pressure mounts and the China tariffs get removed, we are going to have backlogged ports and full containers not able to be unloaded because there won't be enough trucks to move the backlog of goods.",YesterShill,2025-04-29T11:32:26,0
"So, is the federal government now going to give an English test to every truck driver in America? What is the bar? High-school level literacy?  I'm not sure how many American truck drivers will be able to pass a test like that.",Orwells_Roses,2025-04-29T11:32:58,0
"Doesn't this violate the ADA and FMCSA, which specifically set conditions allowing deaf/mute persons to earn and use a CDL? Obviously Trump doesn't care about anyone covered by the ADA, but that's a very sympathetic demographic to file an appeal to this order in behalf of.",harlemhornet,2025-04-29T11:45:29,0

English is the country‚Äôs official language. What‚Äôs racist about speaking English?,luckyluchianooo,2025-04-29T11:53:35,-10
"Or‚Ä¶  They expect a huge layoff in the transportation sector so to ensure only English speaking Americans aren‚Äôt layed off they enforce this.  When ports were at full capacity they needed those non English speaking drivers, in two or three months there won‚Äôt be enough product to ship.",jiggetty,2025-04-29T13:32:42,-1
Unfortunately trump thinks otherwise,Grumpy_001,2025-04-29T13:24:34,-1
"If I am not mistaken (and I very well may be), weigh stations are state run and not federally ran.  Even still, what is the mechanism to even have this go into effect?  Executive orders direct government agencies under the executive branch to conduct their business in a certain way.  To my knowledge, commercial licenses are issued by the state and not a federal agency.  Each state comes up with their own guidelines for issuing those.  So, Trump cannot force a state to change those via executive order.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-29T11:36:24,4
"English is not the country's official language. As of 2025, English is the only language the Executive branch of the Federal Government will use. There has been no constitutional amendment or law passed making English the official language of the nation.",ArgentNoble,2025-04-29T11:59:56,11
There‚Äôs nothing racist about speaking English. Not allowing citizens to speak other languages is what gives racist. But you knew that already deep down inside your small wittle heart.,sum1sedate-me,2025-04-29T12:12:46,4
"So, you‚Äôre right and kind of wrong.  Weight stations are typically state ran, but there are some that are federal. It really depends on how it is negotiated between the two parties.  As far as licenses, they are issued by the state. However, commercial licenses are subject to federal oversight and controls due to the interstate commerce clause. So, the federal government has some mechanisms to check the language via licensing, but it‚Äôll be hard to actually execute.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-29T11:41:19,7
"They are state ran, but under the guidelines of the FMSCA. There could definitely be a change of policy that is required to be enforced",xicor,2025-04-29T12:04:51,2
No one said you‚Äôre not allowed to speak another language. You should be proficient in English though. It doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno Spanish allowed‚Äù. But you knew that too right?,luckyluchianooo,2025-04-29T15:36:00,-1
Thanks for the clarity.,WhatRUHourly,2025-04-29T11:48:53,2
"Of course. I have my CDL, but I don‚Äôt use it. It was a backup for when I left the Army. I say all of the above, but with how much Trump cares about laws it may mean nothing.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-29T12:05:50,4
