"> Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract whichÂ in fact had a total value of $8m.  Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a ""digestible and transparent manner"" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts ""representing around 30% of all total savings"".
