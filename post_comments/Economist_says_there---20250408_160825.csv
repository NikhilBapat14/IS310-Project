Republicans can't do math.  They can't do logic.  They can't speak English.  And they lie.  So why does anyone vote for a Republican?  Simple: Republicans are good at instilling fear.

"So, the formula used by Trump & Co, to calculate the imposed import tariffs contain errors: the 2 epsilon (=4) and phi (=0.25) factors (4 √ó 0.25 = 1 and thus cancel out as dividing by 1 doesn't change the calculation: 4:1=4, 2:1=2, 12:1=12) are not generally accepted and used to measure and implement tariffs at the WTO and just about all countries in the world to settle disputes?  Or, those epsilon and phi are not in some country table from the WTO and used there to settle disputes?  The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world‚Äôs trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The fundamental goal of the WTO, as set out in the organization's founding agreement, is to use trade as a means to improve people's living standards, create better jobs and promote sustainable development.  https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/whatis_e.htm",SvenAERTS,2025-04-09T01:53:54,1
Never admitting to mistakes is probably a commandment from Trump himself.,Ardnabrak,2025-04-08T22:32:57,7
It's not so much that they're sticking with the bad math. This is where the bad math got published.,pingveno,2025-04-08T19:21:21,1
The formula is not a generally accepted formula AND they used non sensical numbers in the formula they did use.   The economist says as much in more polite terms.   You can expect most countries will dispute with WTO the US calculations.   You can also expect the US to ignore international agreements and norms too it would seem.,Essence-of-why,2025-04-09T02:57:57,6

I don't think there is. That's why we have collectively diagnosed him as a malignant narcissist.,Ardnabrak,2025-04-08T22:55:48,2
