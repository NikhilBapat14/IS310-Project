"“Federal officials described the protest as a ‘stunt’.”   Isn’t that what a protest is? A stunt to get attention for a particular issue? Either way, ICE has to be the most pathetic federal agency in existence.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-09T16:41:10,23

"Yes! This is what we need from Democrats. Thank you for putting your ass on the line.  We should have done this when Musk and his incel army were doing this to Treasury. I was beside myself that all they could do was stage a rally and level empty rhetoric at the blatantly illegal act happening before them, rather than physically going inside and stopping it.",tripping_on_phonics,2025-05-09T17:00:51,10
"From the article:  Federal officials arrested the mayor of Newark on Friday while he and three members of Congress were protesting at a new immigration detention facility that is expected to play a central role in President Trump’s mass deportation effort.  The mayor, Ras J. Baraka, was taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Newark, his aides said.  Federal officials described the protest as a “stunt,” and Alina Habba, a lawyer for Mr. Trump whom he had named as New Jersey’s interim U.S. attorney, announced Mr. Baraka’s arrest in a social media post.  Mr. Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center,” Ms. Habba wrote. “He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.”  Representative Rob Menendez, a Democrat who was at the federal detention facility when Mr. Baraka was taken into custody, said that ICE agents had “put their hands on” the two other members of Congress who were there, Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and LaMonica McIver.  “They feel no restraint on what they should be doing, and that was shown in broad daylight today,” Mr. Menendez said at a news conference shortly after the mayor’s arrest.",kootles10,2025-05-09T16:32:19,9
I think resistance is going to be local like this. In fact if Americans ever do organize against Trump this is where it starts.  Of course is also 50/50 on the staying home on Saturday to watch if Netflix does a new reality show like COPS in the old days with ICE bullying the shit out of folks.,mangoserpent,2025-05-09T17:00:26,7
