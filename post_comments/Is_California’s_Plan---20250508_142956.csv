Good luck. Trump IS the federal law now.,shakergeek,2025-05-08T16:55:21,0
"> Trump’s lawless actions  The lying press starts out with a faulty premise as if it were true.  Another manipulative article.  > he lambasted the president’s “incompetence” and “corruption.”   that's rich coming from Newsom who in 2005 said he'd fix homelessness in 10 years.  20 years later it's worse than ever and $24billion just vanished in the crony-ridden homeless-industrial-complex of California's NGOs  ---  > But if California succeeds, “this diverse, progressive place where people can exist peaceably living side by side,  has this person been to Oakland??  ---  > And in late March, he threw punches at his own party, telling Bill Maher that in many ways the Democratic brand was “toxic.” “We talk down to people,” Newsom said. “We talk past people.”  about the only thing Newsom is right about.",box-cable,2025-05-08T14:33:54,-14
"Why stay in a state with one of the highest tax rates if you don’t like it here? If I didn’t like it as much as you seem to, I sure as hell wouldn’t stay.",boboto-boat,2025-05-08T15:28:59,3
"So since I don't like Newsom, I should leave the place I was born and raised?   Newsom is leaving office soon.",box-cable,2025-05-08T16:32:06,0
"You should just leave because you’re fucking stupid honestly. I mean saying that Trump is lawless is fake news is an automatic dunce cap. If you love conservative policies so much maybe check out OK, or TX.",Most_Technology557,2025-05-08T17:50:08,2
"No, I’m just curious why you would stay. Seems like you’d be happier in a red state. It will continue to be a progressive state after Newsom leaves office. Do you at least live somewhere with nice weather and not in the hot valley?  What qualities of CA keep you here?",boboto-boat,2025-05-08T16:38:11,1
Shit you’re right. I don’t like news on but this box cable guy is tripping,Massive-Grocery7152,2025-05-09T10:34:31,1
"Just because you don’t like the governor of the state, doesn’t mean you have to leave. Newsom isn’t progressive enough for a lot of Californians. At least blue state stand up for diversity.",Massive-Grocery7152,2025-05-08T16:45:11,2
That’s why I said “no” when they asked if they should leave because of Newsom. Their comment begins with being upset with the press for calling out Trump’s lawlessness. That suggests they don’t like that the state is progressive. It will continue to be progressive after Newsom is gone.,boboto-boat,2025-05-08T16:56:18,-1
