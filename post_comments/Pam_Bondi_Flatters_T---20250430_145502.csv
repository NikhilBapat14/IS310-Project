The president held his latest Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, a day after celebrating his first 100 days in office. The grovelers were ready to deliver.

"""Tonight's story on The Twilight Zone is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. This, as you may recognize, is a map of the United States, and there's a little town there called Peaksville. On a given morning not too long ago, the rest of the world disappeared and Peaksville was left all alone. Its inhabitants were never sure whether the world was destroyed and only Peaksville left untouched or whether the village had somehow been taken away. They were, on the other hand, sure of one thing: the cause. A monster had arrived in the village. Just by using his mind, he took away the automobiles, the electricity, the machines - because they displeased him - and he moved an entire community back into the dark ages - just by using his mind. Now I'd like to introduce you to some of the people in Peaksville, Ohio. This is Mr. Fremont. It's in his farmhouse that the monster resides. This is Mrs. Fremont. And this is Aunt Amy, who probably had more control over the monster in the beginning than almost anyone. But one day she forgot. She began to sing aloud. Now, the monster doesn't like singing, so his mind snapped at her, turned her into the smiling, vacant thing you're looking at now. She sings no more. And you'll note that the people in Peaksville, Ohio, have to smile. They have to think happy thoughts and say happy things because once displeased, the monster can wish them into a cornfield or change them into a grotesque, walking horror. This particular monster can read minds, you see. He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion. Oh yes, I did forget something, didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster. This is the monster. His name is Anthony Fremont. He's six years old, with a cute little-boy face and blue, guileless eyes. But when those eyes look at you, you'd better start thinking happy thoughts, because the mind behind them is absolutely in charge. This is the Twilight Zone.""",TintedApostle,2025-04-30T15:10:16,42

Flipside is he moved too slowly in January, overly trusted Chinese reports, sent PPE to Russia during the shortage, and pushed for treatments like hydroxychloroquine (but honestly, so did legit sources like MedCram).    The anti-vax shit and attempts to crucify Fauci mostly came later from his supporters, though he's certainly complicit.

Many of these laws are not universally applied edicts, they're for a specific group of people, in a specific culture, in a specific place. You do not need to become Jewish before becoming Christian, as per Acts 15:  >6 The apostles and elders met to consider this question. 7 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 9 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”  And to emphasize that not every rule mentioned in the Bible is meant to be followed with the same level of rigidity, here is Matthew 22:36-40:  >36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”  >37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”",MrPWAH,2025-05-01T10:38:47,1

You know, it's gonna have to be a literal revolution.  We can't just throw these bums out of office, we need to break down and remake the government to stop this from happening with the next republican president. . .or maybe a democrat decides to use extra-constitutional means to 'do what's needed', and things devolve further.  I'm worried that a revolution isn't a good thing because the republicans have been maneuvering for decades to do just that.  They've wanted to get control of enough state gov'ts at one time to have a constitutional convention, and then all their people and the brainwashed masses can codify into law their horrible beliefs.  Would you like MAGA voting to create our next gov't?  They might see things are shit now and want to change it, but after decades of brainwashing, I don't trust them to know what 'change' is best, or to not get taken in by more of the same.  Hitler was made to stop.  The Germans were paraded through death camps and made to face up to what they did with shame.  The country was split into two and their government was remade by a greater outside force, when maybe many Nazi's would have been happy to do otherwise.  They were deprogrammed.  Who on this planet is going to do that to us?",SoVerySick314159,2025-05-01T00:06:36,3

">We can't just throw these bums out of office  This is worth considering that they might not be as popular in Washington as they think.        That this administration has essentially removed the lifetime careers of thousands of high profile political and security agents who spent decades of work and probably hundreds of thousands of schooling to do their jobs, just to be booted out on their asses by a cult.        I believe the interesting moment will fall when the rebellion stops being so passive and gets dirty. The admin will tell the cops to attack the citizens while they enact martial law to get the military to do same.        I really don't think that in 2025 it will be as easy to get our military to turn its guns on our own citizens. There will be a few cases of it that happen, but I think the way Trump has treated Americans over the past years and the aggressive firing of their ranks/friends will create a lot of pause for them.        I feel like the military, other government heads that refuse to leave their positions, and the judicial system refusing to die will be our saving graces here",StrobeLightRomance,2025-05-01T07:08:28,2

Person said that we'll never recover, and that's silly, it's literally only been 100 days of jackassery and they're proving that they're not going to make it another 100 days without causing some sort of catastrophe that removes the last of our public trust.

I fully agree that they can be overcome, but it won't be easy and they're doing serious harm in the meantime.  I'm not sure what would remove trust with the faithful cultists. And a state can be authoritarian or fascist without majority public support.  The reason for understanding this is that complacency in the hopes that things will just inevitably turn out fine may be counterproductive.",NoamLigotti,2025-05-03T14:39:14,1
Not sure if you think that is a comeback or something. But yes I can read the atrocities and contradictions in the Bible for what they are. I don’t need a degree in philosophy for basic reading comprehension.

"Indeed. Not to mention that all authority factions in America that are trained for restraining people are essentially just being taught how to escalate scenarios through violence, and de-escalation tactics are pretty much non-existent at this stage in police training.        The saving grace, in my estimation, is that I think a lot of the upper echelon of the military branches are really smart intelligence types who don't want to take orders from someone like Hegseth who is essentially a living pair of clown shoes, making a mockery of what the rest of them worked for and believe in.        There's a vast chance I am wrong, and this whole thing keeps circling the drain, with no limit to how bad it can actually get without ever getting better.        But I'm choosing optimism this time, because there's no way Americans will accept having our Social Security robbed, or accept a constitutional infringement like deporting US citizens to other countries for punishment.        We've collectively sat by and watched this happen, but it didn't directly affect as many as it is now, and his first administration stayed pandering to his voter base.. but because he thinks of himself as this immune dictator, this time around, he's hurting the same people that propped him up.        For this one time, we should have faith in humanity. I just keep reminding myself that Americans aren't Russians. That this is all new and shocking for our system, so as our comfort shrinks, our anxieties rise, and the easier it is to place the blame on those of whom it belongs.",StrobeLightRomance,2025-05-01T08:17:51,2

My WORRY is that people are too out-of-touch to know or understand when their social security is being robbed - or that their preferred ""news outlets"" won't report on it, or will provide misinformation.  My worry is that they'll first start deporting US citizens who were naturalized, with darker skin and funny accents, and they won't be seen as 'real' Americans.  After that's normalized, they'll stretch it to include whoever they want.  My HOPE is that he escalates too quickly.  If he were more clever about it, he could step things up slowly, so that each change is small and seemingly not worth pitchforks and torches - the old boiled frog scenario.  It's my hope that he'll miscalculate and take it too far, too quickly.  Here's hoping.  Thanks for providing some intelligent, hopeful viewpoints.  I have a whole lot more to worry about - citizen's united, the inequities inherent in the Senate, first-past-the-post voting, etc. . . but, maybe for once, I'll leave things on a hopeful note :)",SoVerySick314159,2025-05-01T08:38:18,2
