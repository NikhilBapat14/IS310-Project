"I really enjoy the DC memorials.   The one from Thomas Jefferson is my favorite. I can't remember the exact speech, but it's something about understanding that you can't wear a child's coat the same as you must grow beyond the past.   He says it MUCH better üòÑ",tLM-tRRS-atBHB,2025-03-30T13:06:53,78
All very poignant statements.  Wish our current heads of government were the true embodiment of those words.,gm4dm101,2025-03-30T13:41:12,44
"Amen, This is one of my favorite places in all of DC. Such a great public space and one we need to remember desperately.",Powderfinger23,2025-03-30T13:56:34,25
I really enjoyed this memorial too. Those are the ideals that make me proud to be an American.,jennirator,2025-03-30T14:26:12,17
"Very true! I am an ex-Rep (never voted for trump)  & I saw that town hall with Chris Murphy & his response to the little girl talking abou the free lunch program& that she didn't want her friends to go hungry, that is why I am a Democrat, I want to help people not hurt them!",x_Good_Trouble_x,2025-03-30T18:28:48,16
Just wish our Dem leaders and strategists could convey this message much better than whatever it is they're doing now a days. We need to go back to being new deal Dems and stop falling for the rights culture war mouse traps.,Skankhuntt__42,2025-03-30T14:23:59,30

Visited the Roosevelt Memorial on Thursday. I felt my motivation and hope restored.,Beneficial-Honeydew5,2025-03-30T15:43:14,10
The FDR memorial goes so hard.  Easily one of my favorites.,StPauliBoi,2025-03-30T19:49:10,9
Democrats want you to have agency over your life.  As much as possible up until the point where you balance against someone else's agency.  Democrats want you to get what you want.  Republicans want you to want.,willworkforjokes,2025-03-30T21:48:26,8

"I was there about 9 days ago, thinking about how the current administration is seeking to undo so much of what FDR did. When this is over, we‚Äôll need much more than a new deal.",Imaginary_Scene2493,2025-03-30T19:39:52,7

"Also a reminder that those occupy the seats of power now, are so far removed from these sentiments, it‚Äôs a mystery why they consider themselves to   BE AMERICANS!",La-Sauge,2025-03-30T20:33:10,4

"I absolutely love this, but here is the problem.  There are too many words there for most people to bother reading and digesting.  That‚Äôs why we are where we are, because short attention spans, lack of interest, lack of curiosity, and laziness have destroyed this country",[deleted],2025-03-31T09:39:11,2

"Having democratic values is fine, and good, but if you think our current leadership or the DNC as a whole is looking out for your best interests, I have a bridge to sell you.  The leadership of this party has been an abysmal failure since Obama.  No pipelines, no plans, just shooting themselves in the foot and face and losing to the worst candidate in the history of the country 2 out of the last 3 times.  Embarrassing.",Shadowtirs,2025-03-30T17:50:14,4
"You forget that some people want to ride civilization to its grave rather than give up any or all riches. Humans have gladly destroyed their brothers and sisters on this planet without a second thought.  *Edit: Some humans. But we really have to start looking at who loves humanity, and who is, and enjoys being, a predator.*",Claque-2,2025-03-30T16:16:02,46

"It's the GQP's billion dollar media MACHINE that makes it possible. I truly believe the Dems would love to talk about the issues that effect 90% of us. But because of the media MACHINE it forces the stupid culture wars issues to the forefront. There entire plan is distraction. If we're fighting over whether or not trans men/women should be able to play highschool sports, we're not talking about how trump fucked up our retirement plans, or how secret war plans were texted on an unsecure app, or how Doge is a money grab for Leon. FUCK I HATE THIS TIMELINE WE'RE LIVING IN. The future us, are gonna be very disappointed in us.",jump-blues-5678,2025-03-30T14:46:17,20

"I‚Äôm with you 100%.  The Democrats abdicated the entirety of social media and telecommunications to the Republicans once the fairness doctrine was repealed.  Instead of doing what the Republicans did which is take the opportunity to buy up every possible media outlet and broadcast the same message across all of them, Democrats basically relied upon the ‚Äúgoodness of people‚Äú and ‚Äúfreedom of the markets‚Äú.  As a result, the only messaging platform the Democrats have now is NPR, which is also being forced to a conservative bent by the Republicans as well as a scattering of smaller media companies.  Everything else has been co-opted and taken over by Republicans and this was the plan.  Read the Powell memo.  If the only source of information for Americans comes from a particular political viewpoint, America is going to shift towards that viewpoint. The fairness doctrine prevented any single  political viewpoint from dominating, with that gone and with all restrictions on ownership of media companies removed Republicans saw the opportunity to go out and buy up everything and use those messaging platforms to change public opinion.  In the meantime, Democrats sat around with their thumbs up their asses.",[deleted],2025-03-31T09:51:02,4
"I agree with ALL OF THAT. They also have all of the radio stations by like a 10-1 margin, but it's also incumbent on the Dems to not bite on the distractions. I personally think it's insane to have trans females play sports with other females, but that has absolutely nothing to do with me.",Skankhuntt__42,2025-03-30T21:48:25,2

"Citizens united and the fairness doctrine did us in, and we just kept trying to take the high road. It almost makes me wonder if half of the Dems are in on it with the MAGAts, or are they just that big of pussies? I remember listening to a podcast last year where some big wig of the Democratic party of Wisconsin was talking about how after years of Wisconsin being a 50/50 State, they were finally able to get a tiny majority in the state houses and the state supreme court, they WORKED WITH the GOP to redraw the maps and districts, for it to be FAIR. This was after a decade of the GOP winning disproportionate amounts of seats. All i could think about was that they ought to have worked to do the same thing to them, but no, let's make it ""fair""",Skankhuntt__42,2025-03-31T17:45:14,2
