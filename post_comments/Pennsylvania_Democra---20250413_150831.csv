"This is the stuff of societal breakdown, brought to you by MAGA and the cowardly GOP.",[deleted],2025-04-13T15:18:59,181
So is Pammy going to impose 20 years sentences on individuals attacking a governor’s private residence,Danube11424,2025-04-13T15:47:05,154
"How is this going to get spun? “There was no attack. A concerned citizen felt it was too cold out, so they tried to warm up the Governor.”? Or “Attack? No, it wasn’t. Just because someone poured flammable stuff, and lit it on fire, doesn’t mean there was an attack. People accidentally spill flammable materials, and ignite them all the time.”",swordrat720,2025-04-13T15:38:48,44

"So a man with a gun is nearby Trump and it’s an assassination attempt, and a guy tries to burn down the home Shapiro is in and it’s just arson?  Got it.",Ok-Stress-3570,2025-04-13T17:45:38,12
Fuck trump,CyclingMack,2025-04-13T17:44:57,5
"Maybe now some of our elected democratic leaders will realize how important it is to be able to defend themselves from these Magat TERRORISTS!!!! And stop making every other move an attempt to make it harder for us to do so. Stop with the gun bans and other such nonsense, at least until this domestic terror organization can be put down. For fucks sake, most of us don't have the Pennsylvania State Police helping to defend our families.",Accomplished_Egg7069,2025-04-13T17:13:54,8

"Violence has no place in our society. Whether you a democrat, republican, independent, or part of another political party, everyone has a right to free speech and practice their religion freely. The people have spoken and elected our officials. We must abide by their decisions and hope they will represent all the people. Attacks like this against a family must be prosecuted to the fullest extend",BigTiger18,2025-04-14T06:43:04,1

"Why is it the MAGGOTS are waiting for the ""libruls"" to attack to send troops into the streets; When their terrorism presents itself daily.",EmptyEstablishment78,2025-04-13T15:32:52,75
Was a Tesla damaged?,Oceanbreeze871,2025-04-13T16:11:35,76
I also wonder what cabinet position trump will reward the arsonist with?,LivingIndependence,2025-04-13T16:45:58,26
"They'll say it was a radical liberal trying to make MAGA look bad, just like with the assassination attempt",JorVetsby,2025-04-13T17:14:11,27
Tried to warm up the governor is simply too funny lol,PhatBitches,2025-04-13T17:14:22,2
"Trump will just write ""humerous"" juvenile posts about it on social media, the same way he mocked Pelosi's husband when he was attacked with a hammer, by a psycho.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-13T16:48:33,23
"Well I know how Trump and Co. responded last time around when MAGA tried to kidnap our governor here in Michigan.    Thankfully, the state courts did its job so hopefully something similar for this crap.",ParadiddlediddleSaaS,2025-04-13T16:18:18,12
They literally saw the guy run in and run out and caught him. We don’t need Matlock for this one. ,Jackpot777,2025-04-14T06:36:13,3

"Yep, it is literally never their fault according to them. Everything is a conspiracy to make them look bad.",azurite--,2025-04-13T17:25:29,7
"I know Reddit doesn't like to hear it, but both the far right and the far left are staunchly anti-Semitic, which was likely a significant motivator of this attack. Current reports look somewhat unclear about the suspect's political leanings other than having anti-establishment tendencies, so we'll have to wait and see.",sweetempoweredchickn,2025-04-14T12:51:20,1
