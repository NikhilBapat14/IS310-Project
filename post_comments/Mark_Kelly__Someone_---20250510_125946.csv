Fox News is a great place to find people that are qualified for their positions. To be Trump worshipping sycophants to do his dirty work.,immortalfrieza2,2025-05-10T13:28:33,18
Fox News people are probably the only ones who will work for him,OttersAreCute215,2025-05-10T13:44:26,8
Because this administration is like a bad tv show that would have been cancelled after their pilot.,firstman0,2025-05-10T14:01:23,5
There is no reasoning with the Boss Baby,SteelPumpkin75,2025-05-10T14:52:26,3
"Yeah, but can they LIE as well as Fox News anchors?!",canela925eastbay,2025-05-10T14:57:52,2
He hired OAN too,sack-o-matic,2025-05-10T14:59:49,1
I'm not sure this is true.  Nobody else will work for him.,lsh99,2025-05-10T15:36:58,1
"Yes, but then they might be sober.",botany_bae,2025-05-10T15:53:24,1
Get your DUI hire right here. As seen on TV!,Past_Wind_9725,2025-05-10T15:58:40,1
"Maybe if he hires fox Nation in entire fashion,  the lies on the ""news"" will be less believable",DarlasServant,2025-05-10T16:39:51,1
"How is this a bad thing?  His top prosecutor being terrible at her job can only serve to help all the people he tries to prosecute.   ðŸ˜€  And make no mistake, that is her job.  The DOJ is no longer a government agency.  It is now Tr\*mp's personalized  legal means of going after anyone he has a vendetta against.  FFS his last term he tried to use it to go after SNL.",tinyE1138,2025-05-10T17:52:22,1
But he can't find any other yesman anywhere else don't you know?,PlatformStatus8749,2025-05-10T18:17:53,1
"If he's picked someone wildly unqualified for his top prosecutor, that sounds like a GOOD thing.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-10T13:04:56,0
Trumps main qualification to be president is that he was on TV.  So he thinks that anybody on television can do a difficult and responsible job as well as he can.  And he is correct about that,TonyWrocks,2025-05-10T16:46:13,0
Loyalty to Trump is the only currency that matters,baz4k6z,2025-05-10T15:17:22,5
"Navarro is wildly unqualified to be anywhere near the White House, yet the consequences of his contributions will soon be devastating.",BlurryEcho,2025-05-10T13:16:56,3
"These people know they are horribly unqualified but theyâ€™ll jump on the opportunity which I understand.  Trump is the main catalyst here of course but as I learned long ago, executives hiring on underlings to take the blame for things is nothing new.",ParadiddlediddleSaaS,2025-05-10T16:23:38,2
