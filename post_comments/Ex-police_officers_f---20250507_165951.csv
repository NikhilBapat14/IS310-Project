"The jury sent a message - police do not answer to the law that the rest of us are required to follow. As long as they have a badge, they can do whatever they please and kill whoever they want. Stay incredibly weary or afraid of cops, they are not your friends and will suffer zero consequences for crimes committed against you. If they have a bad day and decide to beat you to death on video… not even official misconduct in the eyes of an American jury",IAmSwitzer,2025-05-07T22:05:57,5
"> An out-of-town-jury in the Tyre Nichols state case returned a not guilty verdict on all counts for three of the former Memphis police officers charged in his death.  > After 8½ hours of deliberation, the mostly White jury from Hamilton County found them not guilty of all charges, including lesser offenses they could have been convicted of.  Shocker...  Keep in mind though that this was a state case and they have already been convicted in federal court:  > All three former officers were convicted in federal court and face time in federal prison. Sentencing for the federal case was postponed until the state case reached an end. Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights violations but found guilty of witness tampering and face up to 20 years in federal prison.  > Haley was found guilty on all counts − using excessive force, being deliberately indifferent to Nichols' medical needs, witness tampering and conspiracy to witness tamper − but that jury found that when Haley violated Nichols' civil rights it resulted in injury, not death. Haley could serve a life sentence in federal prison.  > There is no parole in the federal system.  > Two other former officers, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr., took a plea deal and pleaded guilty in the federal case to using excessive force and conspiracy to witness tamper. Mills' plea agreement extended to the state case and he will serve both his federal and state sentences at the same time.  However, the outcome of the state case will probably lead to calls from conservatives for federal pardons for some of the officers. And Trump being Trump, there's a decent likelihood that he will deliver.  I've already seen Trump supporters demanding the pardon of Derek Chauvin, so this isn't beneath them.  They'll see this case as some kind of ""win,"" once again politicizing tragedy to push their culture wars and inflame racial tensions with ""law and order"" dog whistling.  They of course won't see the hypocrisy in claiming that ""justice was served"" when federal courts have already convicted these officers of unconscionable crimes.  > Five officers pepper-sprayed, punched and kicked Nichols, a 29-year-old father, skateboarder and FedEx worker, during a 2023 traffic stop. Release of video of the beating sparked protests and vigils across the nation and calls for change within the Memphis Police Department.  > Nichols was pulled over in the evening hours of Jan. 7, 2023. Haley and another officer initially pulled him over and pulled him from his car.  > A struggle ensued, with pepper spray being used and a Taser being fired at Nichols as he ran from officers. It is unclear if the Taser made contact with him.  > Another set of officers eventually caught up to Nichols, who was running toward his mother's house. He was less than 100 yards away when he was tackled.  > When more officers got to the scene, officers held Nichols' arms and hit him with a barrage of kicks, punches, baton strikes and pepper spray.  > The assault lasted minutes and was captured on body cameras and a SkyCop camera. When Nichols went limp, he was handcuffed and leaned against an unmarked squad car. More than 20 minutes pass[ed] before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the hospital.

actually it seems because the officer that hit him plead guilty the lawyers for these three blamed everything on him. the prosecution should not have charged them as a group but seperately,dd525,2025-05-07T17:42:51,6
