Children. 3 American children. One has stage 4 cancer.  Pure unmitigated evil.,PastorBlinky,2025-04-27T16:53:28,59
This shouldn’t be acceptable to anyone because once they can deport US Citizens without due process.  It implies that the average American is not safe.  It’s also a blatant violation of the 14th amendment.,Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-04-27T17:10:45,20
I'm guessing the kids were kind of brown or Hispanic or something so it was pretty easy for them to justify this action.  Ghouls will be ghouls.,sniffstink1,2025-04-27T16:57:16,13

I thought they were claiming no U.S. citizens were deported; are they changing their story?,AlexKingstonsGigolo,2025-04-27T18:56:37,3
At least it wasn't that kid he paraded in front of everyone at the SOTU.  because that would just be terrible to his image.,Clubsandiches,2025-04-27T18:17:53,2
"Why is it the ones that parade their faith and family in front of the world are the ones responsible the most evil shit? Like, even if your religion is the real one, your god created hell for people like you.  And in a few years your kids are going to be grown enough to know how disgusting you are and change their name and want nothing to do with you.   Just be a decent person you dicks.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-27T20:10:45,2

"Assuming we have free and fair elections by 2028, these motherfuckers should each be indicted for violating the civil rights of all of the people they deported. Try them, convict them, imprison them, throw away the key.",propervinegarsauce,2025-04-27T21:56:26,2

I’m not defending it at all. But the children were given options to stay with other family and friends. They mothers choose to take them with them.,EnvironmentalRip8368,2025-04-28T01:32:44,1

"The children weren’t deported their mother was. I’m not defending the orange man or an apologist but we must stick to facts or we are no better than him. In all cases children were given options to stay with family/friends who are legal residents. Their mothers who were here illegally were deported and chose to take their children with them, which is understandable.",EnvironmentalRip8368,2025-04-28T01:34:51,-3
At this rate I won’t be surprised when they do that next.,another-altaccount,2025-04-27T19:05:15,3

A rather important detail I’d say,KnezNikola,2025-04-28T02:34:13,2
So you are defending pulling a mother away from a child fighting cancer.   You are absolutely an apologist.  Maybe get some humanity,Angrbowda,2025-04-28T06:53:32,1
Then it’s our job to make them happen.,propervinegarsauce,2025-04-27T22:13:04,2
"If we are going to claim to be better than him, we have to stick to facts. I don’t know why I’m being downvoted by telling the truth. Spreading misinformation is stooping to his level, and like you said it’s a very important detail.",EnvironmentalRip8368,2025-04-28T02:48:24,5
It’s a distinction without difference.  Imagine pulling a mother away from a child fighting cancer?  Imagine defending that monstrosity,Angrbowda,2025-04-28T06:48:26,-1
