"Get rid of your fascists, bring back the rule of law, clean up your house, then we might consider it once the anger fades away.  But if americans truly think *price* has anything to do with our avoidance of their country, they haven't been paying attention ...  They should.  In the meantime, I'll keep on visiting Canada, Europe and South America.",GargantuaBob,2025-05-10T09:44:22,12
US tourism can crater and every worker can live in a refugee camp for all I care. I will not spend dime 1 in the Fascist States of Embarassment.,lcdr_hairyass,2025-05-10T09:44:56,9
Never again. I'll stay right here in beautiful Canada. Plus I don't want to take away from what little you can import anymore. Enjoy the tariffs. ,Canadian_hiker216,2025-05-10T10:12:08,1
Hopefully these discounts and tv ads / campaigns have the opposite effect and confirm to Canadians that the pressure is working. Canadians should keep up the boycott until these ridiculous tariffs and arbitrary detentions are stopped.,dnddetective,2025-05-10T10:33:09,1

lol No discounts would ever win me back if I lived over there. It is literally very unsafe here and AmeriKKKa wanted to cut them out as allies with tariffs and threats of invasion.,AmiTwo,2025-05-10T09:29:49,9
There’s no discount that can make up for being stabbed in the back.,drewliveart,2025-05-10T10:39:54,1
"Good luck with that, the tariffs are one thing but attacking the sovereignty of Canada for shits and giggles has now changed the relationship forever.  So please enjoy losing your tourism industry and becoming the new nazy regime.",Dull-Objective3967,2025-05-10T10:31:23,1
"Really? They think the problem is that it’s too expensive to go. Seriously. Southern Ontarian here, we used to travel often to the US, even on day trips, but I absolutely not setting foot in that country as long as this continues.   Tariffing us, talking about annexing (I.e coming in and murdering us most likely), and the fact that I could have my cellphone checked and spend the rest of my life in a hellhole torture prison. No thanks, keep the discount.",Saidhain,2025-05-10T11:23:38,1
"Never sorry about this take: You could not pay me even billions to take a risk that my life gets ended by disappearing to El Salvador. I'm a vocal critic, there is zero chance I'm not targeted. The USA is no longer a safe place to travel let alone work let alone live. Politics and treaties may take a while to catch up, but my decisions are entirely set.",FluidmindWeird,2025-05-10T11:26:02,1

I wonder how the Canadian side is doing and if they have a bit of an upsurge.,Xanderson,2025-05-10T12:31:06,1

Correct answer. Even us Americans can't trust our govt.,williamgman,2025-05-10T09:30:40,29
"Had huge plans for 2025, where we would take a big family cruise from Orlando with grandparents, kids ..etc, and then few months later, the two of us would visit Denver for the Coldplay concert.  With current prices and USD-CAD conversion, it was a decent amount of money. But if they have recently jailed some Canadian travellers, there is no hope for my brown ass, who knows what risk I may be encountering. Also, the 51st state comment just make me sour.  So, we cancelled all our plans, took a trip to Punta Cana, and we may road trip to Quebec City in the summer.  Apprehending tourists just makes things so dangerous, I can't afford to sit in a jail becuase I wanted to see Coldplay, lol.",GreyMatter22,2025-05-10T12:03:05,1

"Many, if not most, Americans see everything through the prism of money, it's how they've been conditioned for the last half century or more. It's why almost all the political rhetoric revolves around it. DOGE cuts, NATO contributions, foreign aid. Tax cuts, tariffs, egg prices. Weapons for Ukraine or minerals from Ukraine. Bail bonds and private prisons. It's almost never about whether something is inherently good or bad, it's about how much it costs, how much it is worth or how much profit can be made from it.  So it's only natural that their response to Canadians not coming to the US is ""oh, they must think it's too expensive, we'll cut prices and that will fix it"".  Trump is the ultimate expression of this, everything revolves around money for him, any other principles be damned.",CharacterUse,2025-05-10T15:24:09,1
"The GOP constantly parrots that the US government is totally useless and incompetent, and that they are out to get you and cannot be trusted.  Then they do everything they can to make it that way.",SpoppyIII,2025-05-10T13:23:56,1
