NPR gets 1% of their funding from the government. PBS gets 15% of their funding from the government. I bet they'll be ok. I can see donors stepping up to help make up the difference.,cakesandpiescnp,2025-05-02T09:53:28,3

"Exactly. The last real mainstream news channel in the US, and a channel that shows mostly educational content. Of course he doesn't want them.  He'd rather have Fox, and what ever the F Alex Jones is calling his new conspiracy news network.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T09:28:21,1
"Yeah, I've never donated before, now I will.",Waggmans,2025-05-02T10:19:48,7
"Public media in the US is atrocious. NPR blacklisted Noam Chomsky. Because when you rely on private funding, your goal is no longer to inform the people, but to please donors. The GOP massively cut funding for public media in the 2000s and 1990s.",kiwigate,2025-05-04T07:05:58,1
"It's a republican held Congress until 2026...until then, complaining about it, writing our Reps, and protesting is about all we have.   What would you suggest?",SAJ-13,2025-05-02T09:32:05,7

I don't think elections are going to be fair from here on out... or at least that is the ominous feeling I have.,coolcalmfuzz,2025-05-02T09:34:44,0

"Can you people seriously stop? Until the next elections happen, and we see how it turns out, at least try, giving up is cowardly.",FloralIndoril,2025-05-02T09:40:38,0
