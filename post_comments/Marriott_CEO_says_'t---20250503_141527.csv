What business wouldn't want to welcome all?   There is no need for LGBT night at a baseball game for example. LGBT (and everybody else) are welcome every day. You don't need a special invitation. You have never been excluded.,cossbobo,2025-05-03T15:10:51,90
'We welcome all to our hotels and welcome opportunity for all'.  What a milquetoast comment.,jakerepp15,2025-05-03T14:33:00,21
"It’s hilarious how non-positional his message was and how people are swooning over it. Like you could spin it as an argument for colorblind meritocracy.  He advertises that they create *opportunity* for all, not *outcome* for all.   He also says the way they operate the hotels today hasn’t fundamentally changed in the last 98 years.  Which includes a lot of time when black people probably weren’t allowed to stay at many of their hotels.",serial_crusher,2025-05-03T19:08:36,5
I’m a minority and I’ve long said- if you’re not discriminating and you simply train your employees not to discriminate when they’re hired you don’t need a designated DEI dept or program. Make it a PowerPoint during onboarding lol Anti discrimination should just be baked into your practices. We don’t have an anti theft officer for employees at workplaces bc the expectation is you won’t steal. The expectation is you don’t discriminate and if you do hr will handle it and you lose your job.

"You are correct. But DEI exists to encourage discrimination against people who are perceived as being in the wrong groups. Businesses will happily advertise that they're woman owned, black owned, LGBT owned, etc. but if a business advertised being manipulated owned, white owned, or straight owned they'd probably get ""peacefully"" firebombed. ",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-03T23:40:31,14
"Just punish the assholes instead of giving a select few people special treatment. It's literally as simple as that. You won't make a job more inclusive by recruiting a lot more women for example. It will literally have a reverse effect of those women having a permanent ""didn't earn it"" sticker on their back and becoming targets of spite. Instead you let people go where they wanna go and if let's say some guys will be making fun of a woman working for example as a mechanic then just punish those guys. Essentially weed out the bad actors and the atmosphere will become inviting on its own.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-05-05T18:02:32,1
