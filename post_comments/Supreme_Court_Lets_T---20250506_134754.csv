"> The second order declared that identifying as transgender ""conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle"" and would hamper military preparedness.  The supreme court agrees with Trump that simply being transgender, means you are an immoral person. This is America and it's only the beginning.",this_my_sportsreddit,2025-05-06T14:13:04,14

"As much as I am pro keeping trans women out of women’s sports. I’m more troubled by this ruling, anyone should be able to serve. It’s BS ",Current_Animator7546,2025-05-06T13:58:11,-8
Totally takes out the meaning of volunteer.  Serving the country should be for all.  You aren’t competing with the people you help protect,Onlyplay2k,2025-05-06T15:05:20,2
"Absolutely. The military also relies heavily on people signing up who are trying to avoid becoming homeless, need healthcare, etc. and not because they are patriotic. The LGBTQ community is disproportionately at risk of being homeless, especially youth. I would expect to see enrollment numbers drop.",tangylittleblueberry,2025-05-06T14:45:08,2

Honestly don’t get the reason why.  More troops the better if you are talking about military power.  Why does it matter as long as they are efficient and good at what they do,Onlyplay2k,2025-05-06T13:59:17,4

Or maybe there’s just a clear common sense line they want to draw instead of the knob being turned completely one way or the other.,TDeath21,2025-05-06T15:27:22,-2
