"Nothing.. however they will offer companies tax incentives which is basically corporate welfare. Businesses use these to do nothing and make a lot of money at taxpayer's expense. Example:   Apple.

Apple was given 39 years to complete the project before taxes will be reevaluated. That was 2018. 7 years later, Apple has paused the project and collects the tax incentives. Sure, in 2057 the state can sue Apple and try to get some of its money back. In the meantime (and probably long after) Apple is being paid to do nothing.

If Trump is keep the money that is supposed to go to blue states, then blue states should stop paying taxes.

Tell that to Trump he'll laugh you out,   Call your conservative Republican representatives, your senator  Face it dude, the law to govern is dysfunctional right now.    Did impeachment work last time or the time before? As long as Trump has the Supreme Court in his pocket they won't remove him from office which is the more important part of the impeachment that didn't happen the last two times due to Conservative Republicans. That would require a *ahem ""*flush out of the senators and supreme Court judges he put in place.*""  So, the president, the senators, and representatives are supposed to represent the country. Withholding funding from Blue states suggests otherwise, not removing Donald Trump twice also suggests otherwise. So the blue states fight back like California bypassing the tariffs.  If one law is broken it's effects another and causes responses back. The problem is the person who started it, which in the case of the Tariffs - Donald Trump, the case of witholding *funds that were legally allocated to blue states* what Donald Trump is doing is violating the misappropriation act. And the conservative Republican representatives, senators, and supreme Court judges who allowed it to happen by *not removing him from office when he was impeached, and allowing him to run after January 6th insurrection.""* Additionally passing that law this past year allowing him to run for president again after causing an insurrection. The time of sticking to the law are done, and not by democrats choice, by Trump, the conservative Republicans choice. Democrats are simply responding to their dysfunction. Sitting still following the rules while the other party bends them won't change the fact that the rules are being bent so far that it is destroying the US's democracy.

It then becomes picking season for the Republicans getting the low bearing fruit. What's left won't be enough to save the values or foundations of the country.
