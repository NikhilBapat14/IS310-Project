"They were selling, not losing. And what difference does a temporary setback make to a billionaire? They have more money than they can ever spend in their lifetimes anyway, unlike most of us, and enough power to buy countries and their politicians. There are multiple billionaires running the U.S. right now.  Articles like this are supposed to make you think there is progress or some kind of retribution for the concentration of wealth, so that you can feel good. Nothing could be further from the truth. Wealth and power is concentrating, not being dispersed back to the people. Don't fool yourself.",h4ms4ndwich11,2025-04-29T10:11:35,124

Nowhere.  It's potential loses.  Billionaires aren't sitting on a pile of money like Scrooge McDuck.  All of their money is in stocks.  When the stock price drops they 'lose' money.  When the price goes up they 'gain' money. Not a single billionaire has lost a single penny.,GarlicPheonix,2025-04-29T10:55:50,2
"This is true. They aren’t concerned about losing a little money if they think they can make it back later. Keep boycotting. Don’t use their platforms or services at all costs.

These corporations and tech overlords need to feel it until they run tails tucked bankrupt to live in their state of the art bunkers. That’s when you *maybe* can feel good about their misfortune. Until then, double down and don’t stop.",sum1sedate-me,2025-04-29T10:45:02,14
