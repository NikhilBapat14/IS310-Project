"Why?  Those are need-to-know only.    If they have no need, they breaking the law.",insuproble,2025-04-28T13:32:53,23
">""This reporting is false. No DOGE personnel have accessed these NNSA systems. The two DOGE individuals in question worked within the agency for several days and departed DOE in February,"" the spokesperson told NPR in an e-mailed statement.   >The two sources contacted by NPR declined to be identified publicly because they were not authorized to speak about the matter to the press. They were able to directly see Ramada and Farritor's names in the directories of the networks. The network directories are visible to thousands of employees involved in nuclear weapons work at facilities and laboratories throughout the U.S., but the networks themselves can only be accessed on specific terminals in secure rooms designated for the handling of classified information.   I guess this saves them the trip of having to go to Mar a Lago for nuclear secrets held in a spare bathroom and pool utility closet.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T13:33:29,13
EVERYTHING has been compromised at this point.  We are literally a nation being run by unqualified people cosplaying in important positions.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-28T13:55:22,5
Can they hook these classified networks right up to Starlink for the Russians? That'd be nice.,CockBrother,2025-04-28T14:17:33,4
So Russia doesn’t need to nuke us if they can just have us nuke ourselves. So fun and cool. You know what? I _am_ tired of winning,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-28T14:36:15,5

"When has breaking the law applied to this administration?  As Trump says, he can murder someone in broad daylight … and nothing happens.",Ugh-screen-name,2025-04-28T14:11:38,9
And that's the most optimistic scenario.,IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-28T14:09:34,6
"If we're ever rid of this administration, I genuinely don't know what you can trust with the children running the asylum. All the way down to the hardware that supports the entire US government. It's that fucking scary and not hyperbole. Haven't reached out to anyone I know at CISA in a while but before they started cutting it was not a good vibe.   They've had access with auditing disabled in environments. They've had someone overseas **USE** credentials minted minutes before. They had a valid username and password but was thankfully still blocked.   Our Defense Secretary has shared classified intelligence over Signal (now multiple times) and had unsecured line in his office so he can continue to use it. All while there exist secure ways to communicate.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T13:44:26,4
They're giving it to Iran. Trump is letting Iran continue with their nuclear program and now criminal Bibi is shitting his pants in rage.,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-28T13:47:13,1
