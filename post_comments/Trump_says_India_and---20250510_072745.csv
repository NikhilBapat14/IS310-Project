"Why is Trump's declaration the headline? This is in the article:  > Pakistan's foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire ""with immediate effect"".",BaronGrackle,2025-05-10T07:33:40,29

Didn’t JD Vance say that the India-Pakistan war is none of America‘s business? Why is Trump taking the credit?,Altruistic_Worth1663,2025-05-10T08:29:26,10
Didn't Vance just say yesterday that this conflict wasn't any of our business and that we weren't getting involved?,Grey_0ne,2025-05-10T08:28:06,8
"Indian Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said, ""Pakistan's Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO) called Indian DGMO at 15:35 hours earlier this afternoon. It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect from 1700 hours Indian Standard Time. Today, instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding. The Directors General of Military Operations will talk again on the 12th of May at 1200 hours.""  It was basically decided between 2 countries, Trump tweeted to take credit lol",brisik,2025-05-10T07:52:42,3

Exactly.  It was reported that way in the Guardian under one headline and then had a couple of more without him.  What he says is immaterial in this conflict.,koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-10T07:39:07,3

"A Pakistan-India conflict is one of those high stakes things where every mediating side tries to downplay it to avoid mass panic because it's the only place on earth where nearly 2 billion people being obliterated in a nuclear war between two next-door neighbours is a reality that's one mishap away, thanks to both countries' uncompromising position on Kashmir.  Clinton said mediating between India and Pakistan during the 1999 Kargil war was the single most stressful time of his presidency, and Obama said that Pakistan was the one country that kept him up most at night. I think Trump is too stupid to realize the gravity of the situation, but Rubio certainly does.",retroguy02,2025-05-10T09:42:39,4

There’s no reporting that Trump had anything to do with this but his own words and the lemming cultists are already set to believe ,CHOLO_ORACLE,2025-05-10T08:48:27,7
"Didn't they just say ""America will stay out of this"". And now Trump is saying he is responsible for the ceasefire, even though there's no source from it from India or Pakistan.

"I find it interesting how people who support Trump point to Biden as if that excuses a wider escalation of the problem by Trump.  Both can be bad, but it never means equally as bad.  If you voted for Trump thinking that would be better than Biden you were blind to ideology and accepted the tribal role while deflecting responsibility for speeding up genocide.",TintedApostle,2025-05-10T08:32:30,3
