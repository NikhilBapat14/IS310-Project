Absolutely *shocked* that a deal negotiated by someone with a history of bankruptcies and shady business practices didn't benefit American workers. Who could have possibly seen this coming?,InterestingLife8149,2025-05-08T16:32:43,476
">Our biggest trade problem, everyone agrees, is China. China sells us [$295 billion more in goods](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china) than we sell to them. Slapping a 145 percent minimum tariff on all Chinese goods is not an intelligent solution to the problem, but it *is* a problem, all the same.  Is the trade deficit with China *truly* a problem? There is no mystery why it is so - the U.S. is a huge, wealthy, consumerist market, and China is an uber low-cost manufacturing locale.  The deficit is to be expected.  The U.S. has a huge global trade surplus in services.  We'd all do good to read about [China shock.](https://www.cato.org/research-briefs-economic-policy/china-shock-revisited-job-reallocation-industry-switching-us-labor#)",Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T16:53:44,252
"Master negotiator strikes again😲  ""It’s a great day to be an Anglophile. But the global economy is still on the verge of a ruinous trade war.""  ""It's is therefore good news that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will finally initiate trade talks with China this weekend—talks that Trump previously claimed were already taking place, but weren’t.   **One remarkable development since Trump moved back into the White House is that statements from the habitually mendacious Chinese government are now more credible than statements from the president of the United States. But set that aside.**   If you want to call something a “breakthrough,” sitting down with Chinese trade officials is a much bigger deal than sitting down with a bunch of people who talk like Anthony Hopkins.""  *""We* don’t have much of a trade problem with the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom has a big trade problem with *us*, because *our* trade surplus is *their* trade deficit. Also, we are, among nations, the United Kingdom’s [biggest trading partner](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF11123.pdf), whereas the United Kingdom is only our [seventh-largest trading partner](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF11123.pdf). We’re just not that into them.""  ""Trump’s trade deal with the UK, which exists only in rough outline, makes Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s life somewhat easier. Starmer’s diplomatic strategy has been to flatter Trump at every turn—which can’t have been easy for him—and to get King Charles to invite Trump to visit him at Dumfries House or Balmoral Castle, both situated near Trump golf courses in Scotland. This charm offensive has now been rewarded with a reduction in tariffs, from 27.5 to 10 percent, on Jaguars, Land Rovers, and other British automobiles exported to America, and the complete elimination of tariffs on the UK’s struggling steel industry. In addition, the UK will be permitted to export, tariff-free, up to 13,000 metric tons of beef. All British exports, however, will still be subjected to the same across-the-board 10 percent tariff Trump is imposing on all countries.""  ""In return, the United States receives … not much. ""  ""There is no deal on pharmaceuticals, on which Trump has threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff.

In some simplistic sense if you don't have deficits with a bunch of countries you aren't doing trade properly. There's no point in trade that exchanges goods that cost the same as you produce locally. You have to get them cheaper than you would have or there wouldn't be a benefit to it. Follow that logic and there has to be an imbalance UNLESS you hit the extremely improbable outcome that by chance there are exactly as many wins on either side for a particular country. It's inherently unlikely though because countries are inherently different to each other. What you need is an overall trade balance across all countries so you aren't going into debt. But insisting on getting that a per country level is going to essentially constrain you to low value trade in most places.,redditrasberry,2025-05-09T02:52:48,3

"Having a trade deficit with China isn't a real problem. There are some real problems that are sort of adjacent to it, though, and they don't really have easy fixes (they're also all, by the way, made way fucking worse by these tariffs).   One problem is that China is doing a bunch of unethical shit like using child labor as well as enslaving and genociding Uyghurs. I don't know how to solve that problem. Realistically, it requires a lot of governments that care about their poor and working class more than they do for their billionaires to work together to reduce wealth inequality globally, and I've got no fucking clue how to make that happen.   Another issue *is* the reduction in American domestic manufacturing capability. We still assemble a lot of stuff and have some heavy industry, but heavy industry is declining. There are a lot of causes for this, and it's impossible for me to give a comprehensive explanation of why in a reddit post. It's not really important economically to have domestic production if you can close the economic gap with services (which we've done quite well for a very long time), but it is potentially a very serious national security issue if we ever end up in a war with a peer adversary.   Part of the cause is that the US dollar is still the world's reserve currency (although it's questionable how long that continues to be the case). That inflates the value of the dollar, making it really cheap for Americans to travel overseas and buy stuff overseas, but it makes it relatively more expensive to pay Americans to do things. To be clear, I think it is more to the benefit of the United States than its detriment to be in that very powerful global economic position. I also think it does, however, necessitate a different style of government subsidization of industry to what we've seen previously (and that money would have to come from the ultra wealthy. Tax wealth, not work.)",wormhole_alien,2025-05-09T00:21:23,0

"The whole bring the factories home BS is just a con the Republicans are selling at the moment, not to say the Democrats haven’t tried selling the same lie, although one could argue that they at least believed in the dream.   Those jobs are gone even if American workers would be willing to fill them because AI would replace them, and those factories are gone, even if companies wanted to relocate, because their shareholders would never allow it.",ChiGuy6124,2025-05-08T19:30:15,34
How many of those would also agree to paying more for the same goods as a result?  Feels like that's a question that should also be asked.,wildrage,2025-05-09T00:41:27,3
"God, I remember working in a factory town and cannot explain how LUCKY I felt to get a job at a restaurant instead.  Those places paid a buck more, but were wholly miserable to work at, had toxic fumes everywhere, and no hope for advancement ever.",JstytheMonk,2025-05-08T23:50:36,5
"While I agree that the original error was allowing the owners to move overseas for cheaper labor, from my perspective (I grew up in a county of mills/factories, and saw that effect as each mill/plant shut down over a decade in mid nineties to mid 00s - and saw what that did to the population and economy here.  (working in children's mental health services then), and I continue to live in the area now.  Back them they workers got little more than minimum wage, and could get by on that.  Now most of those people have retired and it's the next generation that would be expected to apply in those jobs, that still would be paying little more than minimum wage.  My state has a higher than the national average minimum wage, and many of the old mills have been converted into apartment buildings or other businesses, so it would take a much higher investment for industries to move back, even if there were enough people willing to work the jobs (we have staff shortages in our stores, nursing homes, social services, etc)",Fochlucan,2025-05-08T21:19:42,3

You can blame Nigel Farage for that. I wonder how pissed he is that Starmer was able to get a “deal” with Trump?,D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-08T23:35:34,20
What happens exactly in that moment we will see. But there is a trend to get away from Chinese dependencies that was also present with Biden. He utilised the allied nations better. For example working close with the EU to decouple fro  China and facilitating investments in Mexico to get cheap production from there.,forsti5000,2025-05-09T06:12:51,1
