"Think we have plenty of suffering Americans to take care of first before we even consider admitting 12,000 refugees.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-06T16:38:56,30
"""The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution — a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.""  We need to repeal that law. We've taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees since 1980. We need to start focusing on ourselves until we right the ship. As long as there is one single homeless US citizen we should accept zero refugees or asylees because you can bet your ass, no refugee or asylee is sleeping on the street.",cossbobo,2025-05-06T16:41:35,24

"One of the things that has been bothering me about some of these rulings is that they ignore a longstanding principle of legal analysis and interpretation - when your interpretation of the law suggests absurd results, then the analysis is incorrect. The law and its interpretation is not intended and has never functioned such that a legal interpretation would bring absurd results. While that rule of interpretation must be balanced by the parallel rule that one must give effect to all aspects of a particular text, it’s a rule that has stood for hundreds of years, going well back into our English Common Law roots. This has that feel to me - an interpretation of the law that suggests that the President lacks authority to even temporarily suspend a specific executive function with immediate effect, much less one involving the ability to control who is able to enter the country seems patently absurd to me. It defies common sense. While I understand the harm analysis here, I think this is an area where simple logic dictates that the President would have nearly unlimited authority to do this.",deadzip10,2025-05-07T08:01:34,1
"I hear China's doing really great!  A chicken in every pot, and everything.  Why aren't they taking in these poor, desperate people?",j3remy2007,2025-05-06T19:41:35,12
