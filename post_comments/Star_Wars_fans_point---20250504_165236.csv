"Darth Krasnov. Emperor Poopatine. Jabba the Trump.  (While we're making sci-fi references: seriously, though, can we have that Butlerian Jihad now? Trump's masturbatory antics with Midjourney are the sideshow to something much more sinister; let's not forget that the tech-right Yarvinite broligarchy is working towards a world surveilled by algorithms and powered by AI ""agents."" To borrow the punchline of a racist joke—not because the original joke is acceptable, but because it captures the mindset we're up against—the worst of these men dream of a future in which we are *all* outdated equipment.)",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-04T17:18:47,7

"“People don’t talk about this, but the Sith—very misunderstood. Very powerful, very strong. They believe in law and order, believe in strength. The Jedi? Total disaster. Weak, emotional, always meddling. If the Sith had a border wall around the galaxy, we wouldn’t have half these problems.”",Biomage_1,2025-05-04T18:44:09,2
