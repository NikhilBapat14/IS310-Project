"Really, so churches get non profit status and any organization trying to give dates and facts and history loses their tax exempt status?  Really Ed Martin?  Are you that concerned with foreign interference?

Fun fact: You can download the entirety of Wikipedia (English and text only). It's something like 25-30 gb compressed.     https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dump_torrents,Pavlovsdong89,2025-04-25T21:31:10,16

"Losing it's tax-exempt status at the Federal level is inconsequential to Wikipedia because it will remain a non-profit organization. As a non-profit organization, Wikipedia has no profit to tax by the Federal government.  State governments usually determine tax-exempt status of non-profit organizations independently of the Federal government. This is more significant because it determines tax-exemption from property taxes, state sales tax, and state corporate taxes. Wikipedia can always move its headquarters to a liberal blue state, like Illinois, which would likely ignore any decision that is made by the IRS, especially under the current political climate. However some of the more rural, conservative states, like Wyoming, use the IRS tax-exempt ruling by default.",platanthera_ciliaris,2025-04-25T22:00:09,5

"The real propaganda here is coming from the conservatives. Of course things like Faux News and the so-called 'Heritage Foundation' are unreliable sources.   Look, nothing is perfectly unbiased, but these guys aren't even making a decent pretense of being unbiased, so they can sit in the corner and cry when people who care about the truth ignore them.",Zagaroth,2025-04-25T22:50:23,3

">The acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia sent a letter to the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, accusing the tax-exempt organization of “allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda to the American public.”  >In the [letter dated April 24](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/44e0c216-6a0d-42f5-b958-943469e5ae96.pdf), Ed Martin said he sought to determine whether the Wikimedia Foundation’s behavior is in violation of its Section 501(c)(3) status. Martin asked the foundation to provide detailed information about its editorial process, its trust and safety measures, and how it protects its information from foreign actors.  >“Wikipedia is permitting information manipulation on its platform, including the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders, as well as other matters implicating the national security and the interests of the United States,” Martin wrote. “Masking propaganda that influences public opinion under the guise of providing informational material is antithetical to Wikimedia’s ‘educational’ mission.”  The natural instinct would be to spread some ""propaganda"", but that might not be the most helpful way to protect Wikimedia and its place in the global landscape in which most of us live.",RW63,2025-04-25T21:29:08,1

"I haven't gone back to look for the source documents, but the algorithm recently fed me a [story](https://futurism.com/elon-musk-cuts-funding-for-internet-archive) about how they have cut NEH grants, including one to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine).  Altruistically, the non-profit's Director of Archiving and Data Services says that fortunately they have other, independent sources of revenue, but that's not necessarily true for ""our museums, our historical societies, our public libraries, our academic libraries"".
