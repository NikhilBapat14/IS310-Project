"Honestly, as a Canadian, shut the fuck up. You might be able to use your military might but look at every single country that had a strong military attack them. You don’t erase national identity. You get Guerilla warfare, with people who look and talk and are closely culturally exactly like you. But, let’s make this very fucking clear, don’t want to be you:   That’s a fucking nightmare for everyone. Plus, we are neighbours and allies, our soldiers fought and died side by side. Our military personnel respect each other, we’ve had each others backs. Brothers.  And I hope that actually means something if this lunatic keeps acting like a fucking psychopathic train wreck of a human being. You want to come and kill us? Take our homes? Take our national identity? Our sovereignty?  And there are definitely people cheering this on, even traitorous fucking Canadians cheering this lunatic on. That is what happens in a post-truth oligarchical world. Weak minds, weak people, servants and serfs to your billionaire overlords, lick their feet, watch your life enshittify, and say the increasing smell of shit and decay and rot of your lives is exactly what you wanted and voted for.   You love billionaires hoarding more of our shared money, destroying our safety nets, wiping our lives clean of any joy or comfort. You love it because your zoned out social media, echo chambers and media tells you you have to love it, and you are so fucking feeble you say “yes master, whatever you say master, oh make my life shitter and take away all I have so you can have more.” Weak, poor, humanitaringly disappointing, in every way.",Saidhain,2025-05-04T19:02:03,10
"Carney will play the game.  Feelings-wise, we want someone to go down there and smack Herr Trump hard upside that greasy orange melon, and shame him on the world stage.    Strategy-wise, that's a mistake.  Carney will know how to play this game.  It won't be satisfying for all of us playing at home, but it will probably be the best option available to him at the time.  He will placate Trump, possibly giving away something of no value, in exchange for stability and safety.    That's the right move.  It is not the satisfying move.    That said, the Canadian government is absolutely looking at alternatives, from trading partners, to military positions.  They know that any concessions Carney leeches out of Trump will not be worth the paper they are written on.    If so pushed, America will discover that there is a dramatic difference between Polite and Weak.    Elbows up.",BadgeOfDishonour,2025-05-04T16:14:01,15

"Genuinely, I'd like to know what we normal citizens should do. Anything larger than an absolutely peaceful protest gets blasted on every fucking news station as ""disruptive"". Our police force isn't showing any resistance to orders of arresting American citizens, legal immigrants are already not getting due process for crimes they didn't commit. Many of us are trying to survive in a world where one wrong step could mean death or torture. The Germans that didn't support Nazis in WW2 were in the same situation.  I get it, Americans that voted for the orange dumbass are bad, those that didn't vote allowed this to happen, but those of us that wanted and still want to do something, can't do anything meaningful. Because that's how fucked things got in 100 days. I mean, am I supposed to throw away my life, get arrested, possibly executed, and be the first in a line of excuses used by them to demonize and victimize others that are like me?  Please, as viewed from the outside, tell us what the fuck we're supposed to do. Because those of us living in the middle of this shitstorm don't have any idea.",jokethrowing,2025-05-04T17:23:23,9

"What your post suggests is that you’ve done nothing, risked nothing, and are all out of ideas. Yes - in the face of fascism you might have to risk arrest, death or torture. I’m not minimizing that. It’s where you are and where your fellow countrymen put you. You and those like you need to take to the streets en masse. Tens of millions in a general strike. Being afraid to take action ensures the fascists win. If you’re unwilling to risk anything to prevent that I cannot judge you. You are the one who has to do that.",Anthrogal11,2025-05-04T17:45:33,8

"Friend, your anxiety might be getting the better of your judgment. Ordinary Americans and ordinary Canadians are equally equipped to deal with a state that refuses to listen, and equally prepared to spontaneously shut down entire segments of civilization at the drop of a hat.  You want mass walkouts? Okay, define essential services–y’know, shit that needs to be done so people don’t fucking croak from neglect. People in these roles can’t go anywhere without hastening our current decline. At that, we might also need to broaden the definition of essential to account for those secondary things that keep people just functional enough to do those essential tasks. The extra-essential stuff: get the people providing that on the exemption list, too. But who are they providing services to, and how? Income has dried up. There’s no functional economy.  New methods of distribution and accounting need to be devised.  And that’s one thin layer of an onion of considerations that need to go into a resistance movement that still has something to lose. You don’t have to worry about preserving lives after everything’s gone to shit, when loss of life becomes normalized, all-encompassing, inevitable. Until then, nothing happens instantly.   Societies and empires can’t simply choose not to collapse. I’m afraid we’re all seeing the endpoint of generations of rot. Building networks to prepare for the worst is likely to pay greater dividends than rushing headlong into a wall.",ANOKNUSA,2025-05-04T22:09:08,1

I did not have a concrete plan - like those of us south of the border didn’t. I fight daily based on my occupation and in my social circle. I’m privileged but I have family who are not. I would give everything to protect them. Everything and anything. I realize not everyone can or is willing to do that. It devastates me to watch democracy fall because of disinformation and hatred. So few seem willing to risk anything to fight against it. I understand how fascism rises now and wish I was back in high school reading Orwell fiction. I’m not and we’re not. Bravery is such a rare thing. Decades of fiction and movies led me to believe otherwise.,Anthrogal11,2025-05-04T18:31:46,-1
