I would like our President to be proficient in English also...,Variak21,2025-04-29T13:01:20,47
"As someone who has worked daily with truck drivers for almost fifteen years the language issue, while it is problematic, is not the problem in trucking that needs the most urgent attention.",finally_wintermuted,2025-04-29T13:05:45,13
Do you know how fast you were going and give me an example of a dangling participle.,KidKilobyte,2025-04-29T13:10:29,9
Do truckers need to be more proficient in English than Trump?,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T13:05:17,4
Dude needs to stop legislating. How is this even enforceable?,UnpopularOpinionAlt,2025-04-29T13:12:52,3
>The Trump administration has not announced said how they plan reinforce the new executive order.  They kind of did through actions.  Deport whoever don't speak enough English to convince ICE agents that the driver is not to be deported.,thieh,2025-04-29T13:05:12,3
"When will the President himself learn good English? He speaks in word salads, and refuses to read, and ~~most~~ all of his orders are being written by interns or chatGPT. Maybe there's an executive order he could create to grant him that literacy power?",RealGianath,2025-04-29T13:02:07,2
"Too bad our ""president"" wasn't proficient in ""smart"" or ""shut the fuck up""",Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-04-29T13:14:18,2
Because he thinks they're trucking in illegals.  He doesn't care about anybody's rights or jobs so he does this.  He's solves problems how psychopaths do.,Searchlights,2025-04-29T13:18:59,1
What if I'm a mute trucker?,skinniks,2025-04-29T13:09:26,1
Will it be illegal for Texans to drive trucks? (Because whatever they speak there is neither Spanish or English),chris-za,2025-04-29T13:17:32,1
"Wonder what next clusterfuck this is suppose to distract us from. Almost every time one of these non-issues become one, something utterly insane was on the horizon.",Frowny575,2025-04-29T13:19:33,1
Let’s do this with voter eligibility and expand the literacy test to include finance and politics as well.,vitaminbeyourself,2025-04-29T13:03:28,0

just legalize weed for truck drivers please,soulfulwave,2025-04-29T13:04:14,-1
I see the “making up stupid shit” department has been busy today.,b_k-king,2025-04-29T13:14:34,-1

Serious question. Has Congress passed any fucking bills in the last 3 months? Or is everything just executive order?,mces97,2025-04-29T13:42:21,-1
Maybe to claim that's why so many truckers are about to lose their jobs.,30mil,2025-04-29T14:01:30,-1
When you step all over your own dick to short circuit the economy because all you think about all day is racist bullshit and revenge.,Elmer_Whip,2025-04-29T14:24:07,-1

"The future is automated trucks, and it will kill small towns that exist to sell food and meth to truckers. It's well past time for it.",Bloodyfish,2025-04-29T13:26:33,4
It’s not ,Decent-Friend7996,2025-04-29T13:39:15,-1
"This Congress has passed a total of *five* [bills](https://www.congress.gov/public-laws/119th-congress), since taking their seats in January.",trampolinebears,2025-04-29T15:02:00,2
"Automated trucking is not the imminent future everyone thinks it is. They’ve been tested on straight, flat roads in good weather and that’s about all they have going for them. This isn’t even counting the cost of entry into the market and the generation(s) of infrastructure changes that have to happen first.  It’s decades away from being viable.",finally_wintermuted,2025-04-29T13:31:03,6
Thanks. Seems pretty low still.,mces97,2025-04-29T15:02:46,0
I can't imagine how they would handle turns and humans. Way complex.,blackcain,2025-04-29T15:19:59,1
"I didn't say it's imminent, but it's promising. Somewhat more optimistic than you about the timing, too.",Bloodyfish,2025-04-29T13:35:49,-1
"For comparison, the previous Congress passed 274 bills in two years, and they were seen as a very unproductive Congress.  That's still a bill every three days, more or less.",trampolinebears,2025-04-29T15:09:16,1
"I was gonna say something similar. Not sure if you're referring to when Biden won and Pelosi was the speaker for 2 years, but she had similar numbers.",mces97,2025-04-29T15:13:12,1
I was referring to the 118th Congress (2023-2024) where the Republicans held the House and the Democrats held the Senate.  The House had two speakers during that period: Kevin McCarthy and Mike Johnson.,trampolinebears,2025-04-29T15:15:58,2
"Ah ok. Either way, congress is certianly not doing it's job.",mces97,2025-04-29T15:21:33,1
