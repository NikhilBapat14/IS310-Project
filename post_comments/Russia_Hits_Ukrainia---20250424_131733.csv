"In the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv since the summer of 2024, Russia launched a combined missile and drone offensive on Wednesday night, burying Ukrainians under rubble, killing eight people, and injuring more than 70 others.  Vladimir Putin, what are you doing?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T13:58:12,606
This is why the stupid war shouldn't not have started in the first place. And this is why the stupid war has to stop.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-24T13:26:50,49
But russia has been running out of missiles for 3 years now. How can this be? Did Zelensky lie about Ukraine’s chances in this war?,patrick_bamford_,2025-04-24T13:31:07,-91

Putin probably wants the war to continue. Time is on his side. The longer it goes on the more territory he takes and the better his position becomes in any negotiations.,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-04-24T14:04:18,443

"Okay. Cool. And how do you accomplish that? Trump already tried placating Russia and preemptively giving away leverage the US might have held over them, it predictably went nowhere.   Now what? Ask the Ukrainians to surrender unconditionally because their war has become too inconvenient? Hope that Russia accepts a peace deal in which they get less than what they could take by force on the battlefield?    At the end of the day, this is a difficult situation and I don't even blame Trump too much for not being able to put a quick stop to it - but boy do his repeated, bold claims of ending it ""easily within a few weeks"" look bad.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T14:51:09,618

Honestly half this country didn't care 3 years ago when we totally abandoned Afghanistan to the Taliban. I wouldn't blame the US for pulling 100% out of this shit show at this point.   Let Europe deal with Russia. They're still buying Russian gas ,Opening-Citron2733,2025-04-24T15:34:31,-19

"> Putin probably wants the war to continue.  He does.  He's a Duganite ultranationalist.

Ukraine won’t concede anything so of course there won’t be negotiations. They’ll just take the entire Ukraine.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-24T16:31:52,-5
How does this help the war continue? If I watched my town and country be destroyed because of my own government's refusal to agree to a peace deal that would make me support a deal even more to end it. What is this world where people losing makes them want to fight more? It should be the opposite.,day25,2025-04-24T22:16:46,-5

putin does not care. his own adviser regularly lie to him and  he truly believes that  Russia  will collapse if Ukraine and other bordering countries  are not brought under his  influence. and he will try to brainwash the people. and he will probably be able to do it,rijsbal,2025-04-25T01:40:26,21
"I don’t think Putin wants all of Ukraine as I said he wants to leverage a better position with territorial conquest in peace negotiations.   Even if Russia managed to take all of Ukraine which I don’t think is possible but even if they did they’ve dealt with worse people than Ukrainians in an insurgency such as when they subjugated Chechnya.   Russia doesn’t have the same sunny disposition as the western liberal democracies in dealing with an insurgency.   They will absolutely brutalize the population for any acts of resistance just like they did in Chechnya as they don’t care about the people, they only care about the land.",KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-04-24T17:34:55,23

"Oh, I have no doubt that Biden's embarrassing display of American weakness on the world stage during the Afghanistan withdrawal contributed significantly to the outbreak of the Ukraine war. I'm not entirely sure if Trump could have prevented the outbreak if he had been president at the time, but the chance would have been a lot higher.  But getting out of a war is always far harder than getting dragged into one, and Trump unfortunately doesn't seem to have an actual plan, either.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T19:50:30,-37

Also your article was talking about artillery, not missiles. Russia is also sourcing substantial artillery from North Korea now which has very large stockpiles.
