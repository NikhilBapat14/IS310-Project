"\>But $150 billion in federal savings is hardly small change.  I hate to say it, but comparatively speaking, it IS. It's less than 10% of our annual budget deficit....and it's less than .5% of our national debt.  \>On Ukraine, through his hyperbole and bluster, Trump has changed perceptions of the war in a way that could make a difficult peace deal easier for all sides to swallow.  Maybe....but no deal has been made and there is no current movement towards one.  \>On the border, he can boast that illegal crossings have been reduced by 95 per cent.  Absolutely! And the President should be congratulated by every American who cares about border security. Then Dems said it couldn't be done....Trump did it in less than 2 months. The only downside is that Americans have short memories and as other problems become more acute, Trump's historic border accomplishment will become old news. Problems that are solved no longer command the public's attention.  \>This week, on the North Lawn of the White House, the President‚Äôs press team put out a long row of signs, each featuring a criminal immigrant who has been arrested. A bizarre stunt, no doubt, but one that emphasised the President‚Äôs highly popular commitment to removing dangerous aliens.  Absolutely. Brilliant public relations! As the liberal media denounced it, they publicized his accomplishments in the process.  \>By declaring ‚Äòwar‚Äô on Harvard over its DEI policies, the administration can force all other higher educational institutions to undo DEI.  The right thing to do. Kudos to the President.  \>By threatening to annex Greenland and plunder its rare-earth minerals, Trump can ‚Äòdrill baby drill‚Äô across America with less resistance.  Nonsense. Trump's Greenland gambit had nothing whatsoever to do with the relative level of resistance to domestic energy production. The author is really reaching here. What the Greenland gambit DID succeed in doing was to alarm our allies in Europe and Canada that America suddenly has imperial ambitions that seem impervious to our alliances and international relations.  \>Liberation Day may go down as the moment the second Trump administration started to fall apart. Or it may prove to be another masterclass in madman brinkmanship.  Maybe. The jury is still out. But one thing business requires to operate and grow effectively is stability and certitude...and Trump has stripped that away from our corporate and business class. NO ONE can deny that Trump's tariffs have hurt the economy.  \>Opponents taunt him for having folded, yet emerging trade arrangements, such as the reportedly imminent deal with India, could end up being hugely advantageous to America.  ""Could"" is the operative word here. I'm rooting for him...but this is all still just conjecture.  \>Meanwhile, the White House can brag about the ‚Äò$5 trillion-plus in new investment‚Äô that nervous companies and countries have allegedly pledged to America, plus the billions his External Revenue Service is bringing in through tariffs, which Trump claims will be offset by beautiful tax cuts any day now.  ""Pledges"" are only pledges. It remains to be seen exactly how much of this ""new investment"" becomes reality. But one thing is certain, building factories take time.......and the likelihood of new investment helping Republican chances in 2026 is scant.  \>The bet‚Äôs already paying off. Trump, the revolutionary gambler, is playing poker with the highest stakes imaginable. And he‚Äôs yet to lose.  Other than the border and DEI (both significant accomplishments), he has yet to win.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-01T16:54:17,166

"The man is less than 4 months into a 48 month administration.  Analyses of ALL subjects/topics are premature.  Some will argue the border is fixed.  To that it'd say ""fixed...for now"".  Others will say ""tariffs are wrecking the economy"".  To that I would say ""we're not at the end goal yet"".  Some topics are too early to take a victory lap because they could relapse.  Other topics are way too early into their process to even start to render a judgement.  Revisit this article in a year and let's see where we're at.",Euroranger,2025-05-02T09:29:57,0

"OK Debbie owner.   I'm not here just to validate Trump....(unlike so many others). I'm here to tell it the way I see it. I may be right, I may be wrong. But I'm not going to sugar coat anything for anyone. This article is over the top.  Those with TDS attack everything Trump does. On the other side is those who blindly follow and validate the man no matter what he does.   I happen to think for myself. Trump is doing some things beautifully, and other things terribly. I'll continue to analyze his Presidency based upon my own knowledge and values. But I will say one thing without qualification.....I'm rooting for him....and I would be truly ecstatic if every criticism I have of him turns out to be unfounded.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-01T20:57:01,56
"You're entitled to your own opinion....but facts are facts. We had negative growth in the first quarter. Like Trump, you might want to blame Biden, but Trump was in the White House for over 2 of the 3 months. Meanwhile, the stock market has declined badly over the same period.

"To earn an A+ from me on immigration he would actually have to manage lasting immigration reform through another branch of government. He is doing everything in his power to live up to his campaign promises though which earned him the A there.  Israel is practically our store front for arms dealing in the Middle East. It's a mutually beneficial relationship in which most of those funds come right back to US in some form or another. I was close to gong with a D+ for other reasons, but ultimately Rubio has scored him a few victories early on and seems like an effective Secretary of State at this point.",According-Activity87,2025-05-01T22:11:03,7
Read the first 3- I stopped giving a shit after that. Huge budget cuts in under 3 months? Not enough.  Ukraine- negative outlook. Immigration- great but no one will remember.  Sounds like another liberal trying to ‚Äúsound reasonable‚Äù with the hidden goal of dampening positivity about what he‚Äôs done. Not buying it.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-01T22:44:56,-16

"Yes, facts are facts.  Which is why your claim is wrong - that ""NO ONE can deny...""   -  Because I just denied it.  Fact, I denied it.  You claimed that NO ONE can deny it, but I did.  Therefore, your claim was wrong.  That was my point.",Papa_Ganda,2025-05-04T17:54:04,1
"i agree with israel thinking of it deeper. Thank you for the input. I would still keep a lower diplomatic grade for other reasons as well, (i do not think that many tarriffs that quickly were a good idea. We do need heavy tarriffs on china but they shouldn't all be done at once) I do think he is doing the best he can with a bad situation with immigration, but it's still early.

"Just a rational response to the narrative that 5 months in....""he has yet to lose"".  He HASN'T ""won"" on Russia-Ukraine....at least not yet.  He HASN'T ""won"" on trade....at least not yet.  He HASN'T ""won"" on Greenland....and probably never will.  He HASN'T ""won"" on the economy....it's temporarily down.  He HAS won on the border and is winning on DEI...as I previously acknowledged. Good for him. Hope he wins on the rest....but it's absurd to claim that he already has.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-02T09:07:38,0
But he hasn‚Äôt lost anything either. Too many fake conservatives here even flaired who attempt the same bullshit the left is doing- discrediting him little by little to undermine the administrations perception. He‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt lost shit and the only large numbers of people who believe he‚Äôs lost or isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwinning‚Äù are liberals. He‚Äôs literally doing exactly what he promised us he‚Äôd do faster than any previous administration ever and your dumbass negative report card does not reflect the majority sentiment.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-02T10:02:28,1
"Well Skippy, your methods of disputation are certainly beyond reproach....and as sophisticated and erudite as you clearly are, we all certainly get it, that you're an indefatigable cheerleader for the President and anyone who disagrees with anything he's said or done just HAS to be a liberal.
