"An analogy I've heard that I thought was apt:  These morons are treating this like a videogame.  They think that you can just pull these levers just to see what happens, and if it's not favorable you can just push the lever back with no consequences.  Not like we're dealing with human fucking beings or anything. /s",JadedIT_Tech,2025-04-23T06:48:56,22
"Trump and his ""friends"" probably just put a bunch of money in the stock market and, based on this news, are going to profit on this quick ride up in gains. Then Trump and his ilk are going to sell their stocks, Trump is going to announce tarrifs again, and the pattern continues.",peacelovearizona,2025-04-23T06:55:10,11

"He didnt even say tarriffs are coming down in the other articles, he said they might come down ""but not 0"" IF China makes a deal with him and ""trade talks were imminent""  the same guy lying about inflation and prices.

Man!! this dude sure enjoys fucking with the markets and people in general. One can not believe a word he says. He will fart out out kisses and promises and then they say OH he is caving/reversing then he strikes again.  IF the China tariffs move at all it is because of the shit HE imports as he only understands dollars with no sense attached.,SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T07:23:37,2

"And supply chain lag;   Even if tariffs went back below 30% which he hasn't specified, orders that were cancelled in the last 3 weeks don't get completed until there is lag time in the factory. Containers don't get across the ocean. If you're assembling in America, you still have to wait for the orders to complete, the shipping complete, before your assemblers are effective.
