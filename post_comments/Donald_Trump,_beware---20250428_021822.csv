">An identity politics intended to remedy the historic disadvantages of selected minorities has left many other members of our societies – especially white, male, working and middle class – feeling themselves culturally as well as economically neglected. Both these approaches reneged on liberalism’s central promise, lucidly summarised by the philosopher Ronald Dworkin as “equal respect and concern” for all.  God am I fucking tired of this talking point.  Also, the irony of thinking liberalism presents a meaningful bulwark against fascism is palpable. Fascists win because liberals would rather cooperate with them than with leftists.  We need real working class policy to combat far right populism, across the world. Not more feckless neoliberals.",iKill_eu,2025-04-28T02:41:44,27

"Maybe, but the conservative only know how to fuck over anyone and everyone, including their own base, just to try and hurt liberals and minorities. Liberals don’t necessarily have to fight against conservatives, we just have to wait for them to do what comes naturally: self-destruct.",FUorangedemon,2025-04-28T09:38:23,5
