"This is the same old resurrection and sentiment of the aspiring (not actual) male dominance trend. Facing the increasing obvious proof that they just can't compete with other men, that women prefer, over them, the way they think they deserve to.  This manifested compensation for their ""Shortcomings"", results in wanting to silence women from expressing their disappointment in their lack of prowess, by trying to rig the game in their favor.  ""I want a hot girlfriend. And if I can just get them to not talk, they can't say 'No!' like they always do.""  The problem with this backfire strategy is that since they know they're doing it, this will only result in even more performance anxiety, and create a huge chasm of self-doubt. Which is why most of these ""men"" have a now explainable erectile dysfunction.

"Ya know; I'm a left of center moderate who has always voted my conscience; even when I found one of the Dem candidates lack luster or incredibly irritating. I take responsibility for my vote, and its consequences, accepting that even when the candidate I voted for does something dumb or irrational I acknowledge I don't like it but it's my fault.  Voting my conscience has been in favor of John Kerry, Obama, Clinton (Hillary), Biden, and Kamala. I support a woman's right to choose, I hate fascism, etc, etc. But you know what else? I'm one of the people you trash.   One of the people you mock and make fun of; and desperately unleash toxic vitriol against, to you don't have to take even one fragment of time to consider that maybe these 'toxic men' are toxic because instead of being 'strong' people who want to reach out and listen to why they are lonely; you choose to be juvenile and unfair and dismissive using unfettered strawman arguments against anyone who doesn't follow your selfish narratives.  This, is why you lose elections. Not because you 'don't agree' with what you're being told; but cause you don't even listen. Even to the ones who are, in spite of it, on your side. Don't worry. I won't stop voting my conscience. I won't stop fighting the horror that's coming our way; that will imperil the cynical, selfish, petty people in this thread who see me as less. Because as horrible as you all are? He's worse, and the people around him are worse; and whatever my grievances with you are, you don't deserve that. Women, LGBTQIA+, POC, etc, don't deserve THAT.  Still it would be nice if you'd stop and consider you might have swung the pendulum too far; and that you've stopped listening to people in your own camp.

"A married friend asked me if I thought I'd ever get married.  And never really having thought about it, I said, ""You know, it seems like a really good deal for men.  But for women, now not only do women have to bring home half the income, but they also carry the emotional load for the home, the cooking, the laundry, the kids, etc. etc.  It just doesn't seem worth it for me--and I can get sex whenever I want.""",Excellent-Shape-2024,2025-04-14T19:52:49,97

I don't hate men, I'm sure there are great ones out there, but I take good care of myself and whenever I'm around men in a social setting there's always some burden I'm expected to carry because I'm a woman.
