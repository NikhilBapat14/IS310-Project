"It's probably the CPA in me, but is that ***gross*** expenditures being cut?   If so, I'd be interested in knowing the net benefit of the cuts.  Think of it this way:  Those dollars were being spent (rightly or wrongly) on certain things.  To understand the real benefit of the cuts, we need to know what the taxpayers were getting in return for those certain things that they now might not be getting.  The net benefit may still be huge, but we can't know without understanding the bigger picture.",Algum,2025-05-08T18:34:44,42
