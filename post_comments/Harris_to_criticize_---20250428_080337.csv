"Frankly, I don’t care. I voted for her because she was better than Trump, but running her was a bad move. No open primary was a bad move. And Biden not dropping out earlier was a bad move. Kamala was never a really good candidate to begin with, 2019/20 primaries proved that. Establishment dems as a whole played the 2024 election poorly, and I disagree with the direction she started taking her campaign toward the end. Not that the loss entirely lies at their feet, but I don’t think the country needs Kamala, Biden, or Pelosi talking down to Americans with “I told you so” while they’re the ones that lost the election in the first place.  In a way, Trump losing in 2020 might’ve been more damaging than if he would’ve just won then, because it gave establishment dems all the wrong justifications for how they should present themselves going forward. I am tired of establishment dems. The party needs something new to stand for, and Kamala is incapable of leading us there.",Esilai,2025-04-28T10:31:41,333

"I'm Canadian, and at my job we often talk about US politics. A colleague and I were talking about how Trump is legit the worst world leader to ever lived.  Then another colleague joined in the conversation, and said it could have been worst.  When we asked him how it could be any worst, Trump single handlely crashed the market, he destroyed the world order by backstabbing his closest ally, while cozzing up with Russia, and he has NOTHING to show for it... my colleague said that the US and the world were on the edge of collapsing due to trans politics and he really hated the BLM protests.  He really drank the koolaid, I keep telling him that trans issues are a distraction from the real issues, the fact that the wealthy are manipulating the discourse with the culture war... and he's having none of it. He keeps saying youth have no future anyone and it's all because of DEI stealing opportunities.  While I agree some DEI went a little too far, and I really hate any policies that even mention ethnicities or races or sex... thinking Trump is the solution to that is just being naive.  So I ended up saying ""well, at least the 7 trans competing in highschool sports won't be able to compete anymore"", and he said ""no matter what happens, it's worth it""  So it's worth it to crash the market, destroy world order, backstab friends and become friends with dictator, if trans can't compete.  I'm not for trans competing, I think it is very unfair for cis women, but what is happening now is NOT the solution.  And to finish, my colleague who was agreeing with me, just threw out there that maybe the other colleague just doesn't want a woman for president, and he avoided the subject saying we should go back to work.  Also, he used to love Elon Musk and I kept telling him this man is dangerous, and he changed his mind! He doesn't like Elon anymore, when I asked him why, he said he is bad PR. Not that he is a nazi, the nazi salute, the far right support... no... he's just bad PR. lol  Real last word : When I told him why he would support Trump who is guilty of rape, and has to pay 80m$, and that he was CONVICTED for 32 crimes, and 60 more were on the way, and he says he never heard of that and doubt it is true.  DUDE.... he likes to thinks he is smart because he uses fancy words, and sometimes I have a hard time saying what I want to say, so he thinks I'm wrong.... but the evidence are right there!!! he doesn't want to see them.",Inevitable_Buyer_934,2025-04-28T12:28:54,0

Kamala was infinitely more qualified than Trump, her proposals for the economy were incomparably better, and they didn't talk about DEI or her being a woman in her campaign at all.

It was wonderful not having Trump for those second four years but part of me thinks we'd be better off if he had just won.   - His second term would've just ended and we'd most likely be done with him in politics (this might be naive). - Perhaps Putin would've delayed the Ukraine invasion since he wouldn't have wanted to invade while he could use Trump as president. So no large scale global economic noise would've happened around then and perhaps economies would've had more time to heal and solidfy post covid.  - He would've been stuck with his leftovers from his first term in the administration. While they sucked too, there was at least one adult in the room most of the time. Now we are stuck with this cesspool of idiotic loyalists who are so far out of their depth it's insane.  - Potentially no project 2025 since this was a spawn of his third campaign (this also may be naive).

">You are part of the reason we have Trump again if you didn't vote for her.  I have said this time and time again.  Somehow it’s easier for liberals to hate progressives more than it is for them to hate fascists.  Because let me get this straight, socialists make up such a marginal inconsequential  percentage of the voting class in this country. We have literally no political sway in the US. We have so little sway that the best we can get is a mix between Bernie and AOC who land as DemSocs at best, which is just half assed socialism where you still participate within oppressive capitalist structures to appease the brainwashed masses.   If you think socialists who stayed home and didn’t vote for Kamala in an election where she could have never won even if every single third party voter swung her way are the problem, instead of the ~80 million people who *did* vote, then you need a reality check.  For the record, I agree she was better than the alternative we have now. I voted for her, told people to vote for her, and took people to go vote for her on Election Day, but I never trusted nor believed in Kamala for even one second to pull off a win for far more serious structural issues with the Democratic Party than not pandering to an almost nonexistent class of voters in the US.   Joe Biden won the popular vote with 81.3 million votes in 2020, while Kamala lost with 74.3 million votes in 2024. Instead of whining about this scary gang of small leftists you can point the finger at in the same exact way Republicans point the finger at you, instead ask yourself “What happened between 2020 through 2024 that made Kamala lose almost 7 million votes?”. Ask yourself what in that campaign possibly went wrong that made her lose that many as well. It’s not like Joe Biden wasn’t exceptionally unpopular for a president and didn’t drop out at the last conceivable second only giving the woman 3 months to run with no primary instead of the year he should’ve given in advance.  It seems to me like you should assess what the narratives surrounding her loss are, and then try and find some truth amidst the sea of bullshit. If people voted for Trump because they don’t give a shit about social issues and cared about the economy, then ask yourself what your party has failed the working class on and how has their messaging engine failed hard enough where they let Trump win the working class narrative, and I think you’re far more likely to find the culprits of Trump’s victory than you are just being salty at a minority of people with no sway.",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-28T10:58:13,7

It’s sort of like how there was a lot of focused messaging about how bad inflation was hurting people and people were suffering… but most people polled responded that their personal economic situations improved. So everyone had to say oh the economy’s poor because otherwise you’re just an elitist prick that profited while the common man suffered.  And now, after people’s economic situations are objectively worse (every person with a 401k basically had a good portion of their retirement get fucked), there’s a lot less handwringing about the common man even though nothing substantively changed and a lot more “well the stock market was fake anyway” handwaving.",ucbiker,2025-04-28T12:49:50,6

That has not been the situation in American politics for at least the past decade. You see it as “center-left” because Republicans have managed to successfully push the Overton Window so hard to the right with no pushback at all from the Democratic leadership that, relative to the rest of the west, they’re center-right at best now. Their policy platform over the last election shows this. Kamala wanted to raise the most lethal military force in the world. She (and Biden) caved in on the demands of the Republicans on immigration policy. Kamala didn’t even want to sit there and even look like she was half interested in fighting any social issues (for example, count the number of times she said “trans” over the last election outside of prosecuting transnational gangs. This will give you insight if you follow on the messaging what her stance was on these kinds of issues). She took back her support of universal healthcare from where she was in 2020.  >If you think in a binary scale where you have as much in common with most liberals as you do with Republicans- perhaps you don't see the purity testing because you're part of it.

It’s saying “Well, I like apples and you are very much into tangerines while republicans are into oranges”. Tangerines and oranges might be different fruits, but they definitely share a lot more in common than they do with apples. If you’re starting from there, then you cannot expect a purity test demanding that this tangerine behave more like an apple. The tangerine would have to be willing to change and try to become the apple. That being said, my comparison starts breaking down from there, but this is very much where the state of American politics has reached.  >Workers rights, unions, honoring our alliances and trade deals, women's rights, increasing access to voting, increasing access to education, LGBT rights, increasing the minimum wage, making immigration easier, legalizing Marijuana, investing in technology and medicine, fighting climate change, investing in our infrastructure, increasing access to medical care, taxing the rich. These are all things my ""moderate liberals"" want and none of which are supported by Republicans. That's not left enough to gain your vote at the national scale?  While a lot of this are things that you would get someone like me onboard with, I would hesitate to call this a socialist platform. Also, I’m only going over some of the ones that stand out to me because you listed a lot and I might go over the text limit if I respond to each one.  Workers rights and unions are an important piece of socialist policy, but Democrats have been a willing participant in letting labor power slip from the hands of the workers over the last few decades as Jimmie Carter’s administration changed fiscal policy to where someone like Reagan could come in and butcher it, and Clinton’s third-way liberalism killed social safety nets that are an important part of maintaining labor power.  Honoring alliances and trade deals is a term with a lot of baggage that I would hesitate to call socialist. Socialism understands the impact imperialism from western nations has had on the world and the ongoing exploitation by the global north to the global south. A lot of our alliances turn nations in to vassal states where we can exercise influence over them through military bases while trade deals with countries like China, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc. keep them subjugated under the boot of American capitalism, servile to its interests at the risk of being having the US instigate a coup on them and ruining their domestic economy. The way we handle trade deals and alliances very much comes from a capitalist framework that stands opposed to socialist thought.  On the topic of LGBTQ+ rights, Democrats have completely dropped the ball on those. I know they’ve dropped the ball hard because I am a trans woman and queer rights has become my single issue (not by choice, because y’all politicized my existence). I have been keeping track of what the Democratic messaging has been on it, and from watching Kamala completely ignore us in the last election, and then watching the Dem establishment put the blame on us for her loss, watching them stand by as Sarah McBride got blocked from using the bathroom (hell, even she’s standing aside instead of taking any stance on this), watching Democrats in state legislatures defect from the party and voting with Republicans on anti-trans legislation, watching Gavin Newsom platform Charlie Kirk on his podcast and glazing him up while agreeing on banning trans women from sports, they have completely lost on my specific single issue. In fact, they’ve lost on it so hard that I’m personally never voting blue again down ballot like I have been for over a decade. I can tell they completely gave up and I don’t have to stand for it.  Also, finally, I consider the legalization of marijuana to be more of a libertarian issue than a socialist one. While it has an impact with the way the federal government treats minorities, the argument is always more of a libertarian one giving people the right to do whatever they want with their body (applies to legalizing abortion as well)  ——  Apparently I hit the text limit on Reddit anyway, so I guess the rest of my response is below",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-28T11:32:41,-2
"I’d argue it’s more like a game of checkers being played for decades and then asking your friend “hey, can we play some different like chess or something?” And then your friend goes “nope, we need to continue playing checkers. There can only ever be one game being played, and you don’t know what would happen if we decided to just play something different.”   Then you say “But checkers is getting boring. Can’t we at least consider adding some aspects of chess into checkers to mix the game up a bit, at least?” And then they look at you like you’re insane and go “What the hell are you on about? No, we’re playing checkers. This table isn’t ready for chessckers yet. Maybe we can try that later when it’s a better time for it”  But then the next table over is playing Chutes and Ladders and your friend notices all the people playing Chutes and Ladders and thinks “What if we got some of those C&L players to our table? They seem pretty cool and we could always use more people”, so your friend now starts trying to modify the checkers board to work more as some weird chutes and ladders checkers hybrid. Also the table next to those C&L players is a different table that plays C&L, except they light the fucking board on fire when someone loses, and those C&L players seem to do well enough with each other where they’re at least friendly and chummy.  And meanwhile, you, the chess player, sit there and wonder “How in the fuck is it easier for my friend to want to change the game to C&L than to just give me fucking chess”, but you’re already sitting at the table with them, and if you want to consider getting up and leaving, your friend says “what the fuck do you think you’re doing? You can’t leave. You need to sit here and play checkers. Actually, because I want the cool people at the C&L table to come and sit with us, we’re going to change the game to a C&L hybrid, and obviously you need to stay because the game is still a little bit like checkers, and you like chess don’t you? You should just tolerate the bits of checkers we have left because you like chess, and it’s sort of like chess enough where if you leave, you will somehow be at fault for those normal C&L players to get swayed over to the C&L table on fire instead, and we can’t have that fire spread”  I don’t know, my analogy has probably been on its last legs at this point, but no, I don’t necessarily need this fucking game to be chess if you want my full throated support for the Democratic Party.

"This is where I get lost in the conversation. Was anyone paying attention during Trumps first term?!  Let me go a step further. Any person of any political affiliation should be fucking appalled.   Let’s go back to Trump, who is considered the most pro-Israel President in US history.  In 2018, He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem which naturally inflamed tensions and broke with international consensus   In 2019, He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights which legitimized land seized by force, in violation of international law.  He cut all US funding to UNRWA and cut all humanitarian aid to the West Bank and Gaza.  He declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank “not inconsistent with international law” reversing decades of bipartisan U.S. policy that treated the settlements as illegal.  He brokered the Abraham Accords, which were normalization deals between Israel and a few Arab countries (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan). The key thing here is there was no input from Palestinians, and none of their rights were addressed.  Then came his “Peace to Prosperity” plan, aka the “Deal of the Century.” In reality, it gave Israel permanent control over more than 30% of the West Bank and offered Palestinians a “state” that was basically just a set of apartheid-like conditions.  He vetoed three U.N. Security Council resolutions critical of Israeli settlement expansion and violence.  He appointed evangelical, pro-settlement extremists to key diplomatic posts such as David Friedman, Trump’s ambassador to Israel, who openly supported West Bank annexation.  He proposed massive arms sales to Israel and regional allies like the UAE, locking in U.S. military dominance in the region for years.  He reversed Obama-era guidance protecting Palestinians from settlement violence.  He signed an executive order that expanded the definition of antisemitism. The order aimed to classify criticism of Israel as antisemitic under certain circumstances, which critics argued was an attempt to stifle free speech and opposition to Israeli policies.  He  praised Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel’s military operations, even as those operations resulted in significant civilian casualties. One high-profile example was during the May 2019 escalation in Gaza when Israel conducted airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians, including civilians. He insisted they have the right to defend themselves.  ALL OF THE ABOVE HAPPENED IN HIS FIRST ADMINISTRATION  Biden has definitely enabled and protected Israel while talking a softer game than Trump. Trump was much more aggressive in changing U.S. foreign policy around Israel permanently (embassy, Golan, criminalizing BDS protest). Biden is more status quo but that “status quo” still means thousands of Palestinian deaths.  Biden has absolutely failed Palestinians in horrific ways, no question. His administration has enabled atrocities, upheld the military aid pipeline, and shielded Israel diplomatically while pretending to support “peace.” That’s real, and it’s a deep moral stain.  But Trump? Trump isn’t just more of the same, he’s worse. Trump doesn’t just enable Israel’s apartheid but accelerates it. He tears up international law, criminalizes dissent at home, and openly cheers for permanent displacement and ethnic cleansing.  He would turn the United States into an even more active participant in Israel’s war crimes, with no pretense, no brakes, and no way back.  If Biden represents the slow rot of empire, Trump represents setting it on fire and salting the ground where human rights once grew. Both are unacceptable. But one will destroy everything faster, louder, and with more cruelty and take millions more people down with it.  You can hate the choices. You can refuse to play their game.

The Biden admin(y'know, the admin she was a part of), continously sold billions upon billions in arms to Israel right up until Biden's last month in office, despite out-cries from human rights orgs and legal institutions about mass atrocities and collective punishment against Palestinians starting as early as the first month of the ""war."" All while constantly going on about how Israel has a ""right to defend itself,"" which is literally an Israeli state department line, and talking about Oct 7 when thousands of children in Gaza have been massacred.  Harris also told pro-Palestine protesters to shut up at her rally, refused to stray from Biden's foreign policy in any meaningful way, and refused to meet with the leaders of the Uncommitted Movement.

So yeah, the crimes are real, the way he was treated and the attention on his life was politically motivated.

Trump:  - reversed each of those  - Brought Netanyahu to the White House; worked with Netanyahu to enact displacement of 2 million Gaza civilians  - called for ethnic cleansing; discussed ethnic cleansing with Netanyahu at the White House  - called for a US invasion of Gaza  - Established anti-Palestinian protester task force  - …and subsequently disappeared multiple students who participated anti-Israel, anti-Biden protests  - Declared Palestinians wouldn’t have right to return to Gaza once the US developed it  - Posts video of “Trump Gaza”  featuring him and Netanyahu sunbathing and drinking cocktails with big hotels and golden Trump statues  - Gave $12 billion to Israel in the first 40 days of being in office  - Called for a U.S. military presence because Gaza is a “Piece of important real estate”",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-28T12:59:00,1
"I get it and you’re absolutely right that you don’t owe your vote to anybody. No one has a moral obligation to vote for a party that doesn’t represent them. Political loyalty should be earned, not demanded through fear or guilt-tripping. Your frustration is valid and the Democratic Party too often treats leftists like a captive audience, thinking, “Where else are you gonna go?” instead of actually offering meaningful, material policies that inspire people to fight for them.  That said, if you still don’t see the glaring signs of authoritarianism coming from Trump and the GOP, that’s on you. It’s not a “boogeyman” argument, it’s observable reality. We’re talking about a guy who’s already promised to purge the civil service and replace it with loyalists, wants mass detention camps, calls his political opponents “vermin,” and floated “terminating” parts of the Constitution. You don’t have to love chess or checkers or Chutes and Ladders to recognize when the other table is literally lighting the building on fire.  You’re not wrong that Biden and the Dems aren’t offering enough. They aren’t. They cater way too much to wealthy donors and water down popular policies because they’re terrified of real structural change. That’s absolutely happening. And you’re also right that constantly begging voters to “settle” is why a lot of people are demoralized.  Where you’re wrong is thinking there’s no meaningful difference between what’s happening at the Democratic Party table and what’s happening at the MAGA table. One table needs fixing, pushing, and constant pressure. The other table wants to flip the table over, burn the room down, and throw half of us in jail (or worse).  You don’t have to play checkers. You don’t have to canvas. Hell, you don’t have to vote if you don’t want to. That’s your right. But pretending that there’s no real urgency in the threat of Trump and the movement behind him? That’s not reality. It’s privilege, privilege to think the fire won’t reach you if the whole building burns down.  You can refuse to participate  and that’s fair. But if you do, understand you’re still making a choice. Sitting out is a choice. Maybe that’s the right one for you individually. But don’t be surprised when others especially people, not Democrats, not Republicans but PEOPLE more vulnerable than you look at that choice and feel abandoned.  And just to be crystal clear if you’re trans, or care about trans rights, Trump’s track record should terrify you. It’s not “fear-mongering,” it’s literally what he already did when he had power  Banned trans people from serving openly in the military, robbing thousands of their careers and dignity.  Tried to erase trans identity from civil rights law by defining gender as fixed at birth under Title IX protections.  Rolled back protections for trans students in schools, making it easier for them to be discriminated against and harassed.  Allowed doctors and hospitals to deny medical care to trans people based on “religious beliefs” including emergency care.  Proposed shelter rules allowing discrimination against trans women in homeless shelters, putting their safety at huge risk.  Appointed dozens of judges with anti-LGBTQ+ records, setting up courts that are openly hostile to trans rights for decades.  Removed questions about sexual orientation and gender identity from federal surveys, making trans people statistically “invisible” for social services.  Sided with states banning trans kids from sports, setting legal precedents to strip trans people of basic participation rights.  And that’s just what he did the first time when he had some institutional pushback. This time, he’s promising to weaponize the entire federal government against his political enemies and that will 100% include trans people, activists, and leftists.  You don’t owe Biden or the Democrats shit. You’re right to demand better. But you do owe it to yourself and to the people more vulnerable than you to recognize that not all fires are the same size.

Look at Kamala’s proposal on taxing unrealized capital gains on the ultra wealthy.   If we want to look at Kamala’s economic policy, then just look at her Opportunity Economy. The thing was tailor made to give the upper-middle and upper classes more money by way of reimbursements in the form of tax credits for major life events that most lower middle and lower class workers can’t even qualify for in the first place.   Look at the way she wanted to handle building housing. 3 million new homes is nice when that’s all you hear, but she wanted to achieve this by stripping regulations away from private contractors to build those on behalf of the federal government instead of just creating a goddamn jobs program managed by them to get those homes built while making sure that money was going back to the people.  >There are constant initiatives to expand access healthcare.   The two biggest parts of her platform dedicated to medical care revolved around giving at home visits for people on Medicare and price caps on insulin, which while great on their own, are vastly less than what she was running in 2020 when she was pushing for Medicare for all during the democratic primaries. She even got questioned on this in an interview and then had to stumble her way through the talk trying to reason why she was for universal healthcare and then suddenly wasn’t anymore.  Also, I’m going to be selfish here and say while those are great policies, I don’t benefit from any of this and I want to see shit I can benefit from too, but that’s not a dealbreaker for me.  >They have lost a portion of their more socially conservative base due to their strong leftward shift on social issues.  Go ahead and count the amount of times Kamala said the word “trans” during her campaign. Don’t count any time she mentioned prosecuting transnational gangs.  Or, well, fuck it, because I need to tell you for my following point, it was 0 times. She never uttered the word once during her whole run. When questioned on what she would do to protect trans Americans, Kamala said “I will follow the law.” That’s it. Nothing more committal than that.  Now, I’m bringing this up as a particular issue because it happens to be my specific single issue as a trans woman that has been majorly left behind by the party over the past year, and it’s indicative of their entire approach to social issues as a whole.   Kamala is not an ally to anyone in particular. In fact, I especially appreciated that “I will follow the law” gem because she very clearly aimed that at trans people from blue states where the law isn’t targeting them, but I, as a Floridian, can actually go to jail if I decide to pee in the women’s restroom in a government building. If she was “going to follow the law”, that leads me to believe she was going to be satisfied with leaving me to rot in prison for having the audacity to pee in public.  The only people saying she lost to social issues are right-wing pundits and liberal mouthpieces on CNN and MSNBC who are trying to convince you she was good on those when, in reality, we only think she cared about those because Trump’s advertising made it seem like she gave a shit about those, and then assaulted her over it, which she rolled over on.  >To say the Dem party is within spitting distance of fascism is the craziest, most baseless, objectively wrong claim I’ve seen in Reddit.

If you actually want socialist policies, you're going to have to put in a lot of work towards incremental steps, almost none of which will be the perfect solution you want. You'll need to work on local campaigns in favorable areas to elect better candidates. You'll need to show up at DNC meetings and argue for your points, and you don't get to just take your ball and go home if you don't get your way on everything, because when you do that the serious people making political decisions see you as an unreliable voting demographic that's not worth talking to. You have to show up to votes. You can't spend every waking moment trying to tear down Democrats.  But if you just want to complain online, wallow in misery, and insist on ideological purity, then by all means, keep doing what you're doing.",chowderbags,2025-04-28T15:05:24,5

"> There's going to be your disagreement though, to some people funding genocide makes the food inedible.  Well, one side was actively trying to negotiate peace, and the other side was calling for Gaza to be levelled so that Israel could build beach resorts. So there's still no equivalency.  And it definitely doesn't help that there's very real risks of Conservatives committing genocide in America to people who are trans, Latino, autistic, etc. And if you think that's hyperbolic, consider that:  1) RFK Jr is already talking about setting up an autism registry, is digging through private medical records to do so, and has openly advocated for sending people with mental and psychological disorders to ""wellness farms"" to “learn the discipline of hard work”.  2) Latinos with legal residence and even citizenship have been rounded up without a warrant by ICE. Legal residents have been sent to El Salvador's CECOT without due process. Trump has openly talked about sending US citizens to CECOT and talked to Bukele about building more facilities like it to house hundreds of thousands of prisoners.  3) Republicans have made multiple attempts to make being trans illegal, treat being trans in public as a sex crime, and also to make sex crimes eligible for the death penalty. And Florida passed a bill to make the death penalty ok with 2/3rds of a jury vote (instead of unanimous).   And even if you don't care about any of that and you're just hyperfocused on Palestine... guess what? It's becoming increasingly difficult to protest in favor of Palestine because of the Trump administration's attacks on free speech. But I guess all those ""Genocide Joe"" people can rest easy knowing that they clung to some misguided sense of moral purity. Or they can chuckle to themselves because they were alt-right online agitators specifically trying to get the left to tear itself apart. Either way, bang up job.",chowderbags,2025-04-29T06:27:08,1

"Again, describing opposition to genocide as a ""purity test"" says everything I need to know about you.   It says that you have no conscious of your own and will support whatever the democrats tell you to do. Bombing elderly people as they pray in their homes. Shooting starving civilians as they line up for food scraps. Murdering children as they sleep in their tents at night because their homes have been destroyed.  This isn't hyperbole. This is what Biden and Harris enabled for 14 long months before passing the torch to Trump.   Any person with a conscious would look at these atrocities and be horrified. Any person with a conscious would look at their government and be disgusted that both parties support this senseless mass destruction. Any person of conscious would then begin to take a long hard look at the privileges we enjoy that come to us at the expense of innocent civilians overseas.  Judging from your responses, you're not a person of conscious. You're just the other side of the republican coin. ""I don't care if my candidate supports murder and ethnic cleansing!

"And again, history repeatedly tells us that simply self declaring as the not-fascists while declaring the other side as despots while hugging the status quo as people scream for change is a surefire way to end up with a fascist state  If you think shaming them will fix those core failures and get them to learn next time, not gonna happen. Voters are thermostatic and assuming we still have elections, voters will ebb and flow still(even the SPD made gains here and there after backlash with the right wing in the Weimer period), but ultimately if you cant offer actual compelling and inspiring alternatives, form a coalition with the left, the fascists will win the long game.

"Are you actually reading what I’m writing and responding to it, or are you just responding to what you think I’m saying?  Biden fucked up. I never said he didn’t. I don’t know how I can be much more clear on that.  Other people not running against him is on the other people. People don’t run against an incumbent of their own party because it is stupid, and political suicide. Every time the incumbent president gets unseated in a primary, that party loses. He would have had to step down of his own accord for their to realistically be a primary.  That isn’t the doing of the DNC, or the “establishment”, that’s because Biden didn’t choose to step down, and most people serious enough to run for president know basic political science.  Your article literally says Biden didn’t rule out running again, and he made no promises that he wouldn’t run again. Guess what? He decided to run again. That’s why you don’t listen to campaign rumors and treat them as fact until official announcements are made.  I get it. You want more people to blame. Unfortunately, the blame actually rests on Biden for this. Him deciding to run again was a massive fuck up, and an idiotic move.

"Then perhaps you can see why I assumed you were in the category I was discussing - because that would be on-topic. I didn't make the assumption out of some victomhood nonsense. I held my nose and voted for Harris as well because she is at least in my political zip code.  My point about the need for self reflection was not an exhaustive list. The whole party and ideological side need to reflect on their inability to speak to the working class. My point was simply that the purity testing extremists alienate members of the party like myself. My wife was kicked from an online group because she wouldn't say ""all cops are bastards"" because one of our closest friends is a cop and he's like the chillest dude I know.

"In public, Phillips was ridiculed. In private, others shared his concerns. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, recalled receiving a call from a Democratic senator in late January or early February 2024.  “I said, ‘Is there any particular reason why you called me? I’d like to know.’ He said, ‘You do realise, off the record, that Joe Biden is not going to be our nominee?’ I was stunned. I said, ‘What, how, why?’ He said, ‘I just was at a meeting with him with several other senators and he couldn’t even function. We can’t run him.’”  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jan/18/biden-presidency-legacy-trump-election  Look at what they did to Dean Phillips when he tried to primary Biden.

Dean Phillips was never going to win even against a chair with a Biden name tag on it.  We had a primary. Nobody serious chose to run. The Dems can’t force candidates to run in a primary that they think is a bad idea.  No serious candidates ran. That’s your problem.
