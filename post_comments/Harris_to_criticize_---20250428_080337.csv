"Frankly, I don‚Äôt care. I voted for her because she was better than Trump, but running her was a bad move. No open primary was a bad move. And Biden not dropping out earlier was a bad move. Kamala was never a really good candidate to begin with, 2019/20 primaries proved that. Establishment dems as a whole played the 2024 election poorly, and I disagree with the direction she started taking her campaign toward the end. Not that the loss entirely lies at their feet, but I don‚Äôt think the country needs Kamala, Biden, or Pelosi talking down to Americans with ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù while they‚Äôre the ones that lost the election in the first place.  In a way, Trump losing in 2020 might‚Äôve been more damaging than if he would‚Äôve just won then, because it gave establishment dems all the wrong justifications for how they should present themselves going forward. I am tired of establishment dems. The party needs something new to stand for, and Kamala is incapable of leading us there.",Esilai,2025-04-28T10:31:41,333

"I'm Canadian, and at my job we often talk about US politics. A colleague and I were talking about how Trump is legit the worst world leader to ever lived.  Then another colleague joined in the conversation, and said it could have been worst.  When we asked him how it could be any worst, Trump single handlely crashed the market, he destroyed the world order by backstabbing his closest ally, while cozzing up with Russia, and he has NOTHING to show for it... my colleague said that the US and the world were on the edge of collapsing due to trans politics and he really hated the BLM protests.  He really drank the koolaid, I keep telling him that trans issues are a distraction from the real issues, the fact that the wealthy are manipulating the discourse with the culture war... and he's having none of it. He keeps saying youth have no future anyone and it's all because of DEI stealing opportunities.  While I agree some DEI went a little too far, and I really hate any policies that even mention ethnicities or races or sex... thinking Trump is the solution to that is just being naive.  So I ended up saying ""well, at least the 7 trans competing in highschool sports won't be able to compete anymore"", and he said ""no matter what happens, it's worth it""  So it's worth it to crash the market, destroy world order, backstab friends and become friends with dictator, if trans can't compete.  I'm not for trans competing, I think it is very unfair for cis women, but what is happening now is NOT the solution.  And to finish, my colleague who was agreeing with me, just threw out there that maybe the other colleague just doesn't want a woman for president, and he avoided the subject saying we should go back to work.  Also, he used to love Elon Musk and I kept telling him this man is dangerous, and he changed his mind! He doesn't like Elon anymore, when I asked him why, he said he is bad PR. Not that he is a nazi, the nazi salute, the far right support... no... he's just bad PR. lol  Real last word : When I told him why he would support Trump who is guilty of rape, and has to pay 80m$, and that he was CONVICTED for 32 crimes, and 60 more were on the way, and he says he never heard of that and doubt it is true.  DUDE.... he likes to thinks he is smart because he uses fancy words, and sometimes I have a hard time saying what I want to say, so he thinks I'm wrong.... but the evidence are right there!!! he doesn't want to see them.",Inevitable_Buyer_934,2025-04-28T12:28:54,0

Kamala was infinitely more qualified than Trump, her proposals for the economy were incomparably better, and they didn't talk about DEI or her being a woman in her campaign at all. Could it have been better? Of course things can always be better but that is not why they lost: you cannot and will not find an Obama  every election cycle. What we need to be talking about more is propaganda. It should not even have been close but fox news and accompanying apparatus, added by traditional media being terrified of being perceived as biased, has created a cloud of massive apathy and an alternate reality of lies.",D13_Phantom,2025-04-28T11:52:34,124

It was wonderful not having Trump for those second four years but part of me thinks we'd be better off if he had just won.   - His second term would've just ended and we'd most likely be done with him in politics (this might be naive). - Perhaps Putin would've delayed the Ukraine invasion since he wouldn't have wanted to invade while he could use Trump as president. So no large scale global economic noise would've happened around then and perhaps economies would've had more time to heal and solidfy post covid.  - He would've been stuck with his leftovers from his first term in the administration. While they sucked too, there was at least one adult in the room most of the time. Now we are stuck with this cesspool of idiotic loyalists who are so far out of their depth it's insane.  - Potentially no project 2025 since this was a spawn of his third campaign (this also may be naive).

">You are part of the reason we have Trump again if you didn't vote for her.  I have said this time and time again.  Somehow it‚Äôs easier for liberals to hate progressives more than it is for them to hate fascists.  Because let me get this straight, socialists make up such a marginal inconsequential  percentage of the voting class in this country. We have literally no political sway in the US. We have so little sway that the best we can get is a mix between Bernie and AOC who land as DemSocs at best, which is just half assed socialism where you still participate within oppressive capitalist structures to appease the brainwashed masses.   If you think socialists who stayed home and didn‚Äôt vote for Kamala in an election where she could have never won even if every single third party voter swung her way are the problem, instead of the ~80 million people who *did* vote, then you need a reality check.  For the record, I agree she was better than the alternative we have now. I voted for her, told people to vote for her, and took people to go vote for her on Election Day, but I never trusted nor believed in Kamala for even one second to pull off a win for far more serious structural issues with the Democratic Party than not pandering to an almost nonexistent class of voters in the US.   Joe Biden won the popular vote with 81.3 million votes in 2020, while Kamala lost with 74.3 million votes in 2024. Instead of whining about this scary gang of small leftists you can point the finger at in the same exact way Republicans point the finger at you, instead ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat happened between 2020 through 2024 that made Kamala lose almost 7 million votes?‚Äù. Ask yourself what in that campaign possibly went wrong that made her lose that many as well. It‚Äôs not like Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt exceptionally unpopular for a president and didn‚Äôt drop out at the last conceivable second only giving the woman 3 months to run with no primary instead of the year he should‚Äôve given in advance.  It seems to me like you should assess what the narratives surrounding her loss are, and then try and find some truth amidst the sea of bullshit. If people voted for Trump because they don‚Äôt give a shit about social issues and cared about the economy, then ask yourself what your party has failed the working class on and how has their messaging engine failed hard enough where they let Trump win the working class narrative, and I think you‚Äôre far more likely to find the culprits of Trump‚Äôs victory than you are just being salty at a minority of people with no sway.",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-28T10:58:13,7

"It was a tricky problem from the get-go.   Technically the Senate should have formally impeached him, which would allow the DOJ to prosecute for insurrection without conflicts.  And the supreme Court should have ruled that Trump's behavior on January 6th qualified as an insurrection and disqualified him from public office.  Both abdicated their duties and the Biden administration had the unenviable task of prosecuting the president of the previous administration, which sets a dangerous precedent for retaliation.  They played it so safe that they slow rolled us into a dictatorship, but I *understand* why. They should have acted faster as soon as he announced a bid for president under the reasoning that he needs to be tried for insurrection before determining if he's eligible for reelection.  But I get why they wanted to defeat him in the election before pushing anything.",ender89,2025-04-28T15:27:36,19

The ""Biden Crime Family"" they called it.  To say that Hunter Biden wasn't the target of political retribution is laughable, a sitting Congress woman entered revenge porn of him into the public record, taken from Hunter's seized computer. Biden pardoning hunter and the rest of his family is the only thing he could do to prevent more retribution once Trump took office.

Their policy platform over the last election shows this. Kamala wanted to raise the most lethal military force in the world. She (and Biden) caved in on the demands of the Republicans on immigration policy. Kamala didn‚Äôt even want to sit there and even look like she was half interested in fighting any social issues (for example, count the number of times she said ‚Äútrans‚Äù over the last election outside of prosecuting transnational gangs. This will give you insight if you follow on the messaging what her stance was on these kinds of issues).

Tangerines and oranges might be different fruits, but they definitely share a lot more in common than they do with apples. If you‚Äôre starting from there, then you cannot expect a purity test demanding that this tangerine behave more like an apple. The tangerine would have to be willing to change and try to become the apple. That being said, my comparison starts breaking down from there, but this is very much where the state of American politics has reached.  >Workers rights, unions, honoring our alliances and trade deals, women's rights, increasing access to voting, increasing access to education, LGBT rights, increasing the minimum wage, making immigration easier, legalizing Marijuana, investing in technology and medicine, fighting climate change, investing in our infrastructure, increasing access to medical care, taxing the rich.

While a lot of this are things that you would get someone like me onboard with, I would hesitate to call this a socialist platform. Also, I‚Äôm only going over some of the ones that stand out to me because you listed a lot and I might go over the text limit if I respond to each one.  Workers rights and unions are an important piece of socialist policy, but Democrats have been a willing participant in letting labor power slip from the hands of the workers over the last few decades as Jimmie Carter‚Äôs administration changed fiscal policy to where someone like Reagan could come in and butcher it, and Clinton‚Äôs third-way liberalism killed social safety nets that are an important part of maintaining labor power.  Honoring alliances and trade deals is a term with a lot of baggage that I would hesitate to call socialist. Socialism understands the impact imperialism from western nations has had on the world and the ongoing exploitation by the global north to the global south. A lot of our alliances turn nations in to vassal states where we can exercise influence over them through military bases while trade deals with countries like China, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc. keep them subjugated under the boot of American capitalism, servile to its interests at the risk of being having the US instigate a coup on them and ruining their domestic economy. The way we handle trade deals and alliances very much comes from a capitalist framework that stands opposed to socialist thought.  On the topic of LGBTQ+ rights, Democrats have completely dropped the ball on those. I know they‚Äôve dropped the ball hard because I am a trans woman and queer rights has become my single issue (not by choice, because y‚Äôall politicized my existence). I have been keeping track of what the Democratic messaging has been on it, and from watching Kamala completely ignore us in the last election, and then watching the Dem establishment put the blame on us for her loss, watching them stand by as Sarah McBride got blocked from using the bathroom (hell, even she‚Äôs standing aside instead of taking any stance on this), watching Democrats in state legislatures defect from the party and voting with Republicans on anti-trans legislation, watching Gavin Newsom platform Charlie Kirk on his podcast and glazing him up while agreeing on banning trans women from sports, they have completely lost on my specific single issue. In fact, they‚Äôve lost on it so hard that I‚Äôm personally never voting blue again down ballot like I have been for over a decade. I can tell they completely gave up and I don‚Äôt have to stand for it.  Also, finally, I consider the legalization of marijuana to be more of a libertarian issue than a socialist one. While it has an impact with the way the federal government treats minorities, the argument is always more of a libertarian one giving people the right to do whatever they want with their body (applies to legalizing abortion as well)  ‚Äî‚Äî  Apparently I hit the text limit on Reddit anyway, so I guess the rest of my response is below",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-28T11:32:41,-2

"This is where I get lost in the conversation. Was anyone paying attention during Trumps first term?!  Let me go a step further. Any person of any political affiliation should be fucking appalled.   Let‚Äôs go back to Trump, who is considered the most pro-Israel President in US history.  In 2018, He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem which naturally inflamed tensions and broke with international consensus   In 2019, He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights which legitimized land seized by force, in violation of international law.  He cut all US funding to UNRWA and cut all humanitarian aid to the West Bank and Gaza.  He declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank ‚Äúnot inconsistent with international law‚Äù reversing decades of bipartisan U.S. policy that treated the settlements as illegal.  He brokered the Abraham Accords, which were normalization deals between Israel and a few Arab countries (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan). The key thing here is there was no input from Palestinians, and none of their rights were addressed.  Then came his ‚ÄúPeace to Prosperity‚Äù plan, aka the ‚ÄúDeal of the Century.‚Äù In reality, it gave Israel permanent control over more than 30% of the West Bank and offered Palestinians a ‚Äústate‚Äù that was basically just a set of apartheid-like conditions.  He vetoed three U.N. Security Council resolutions critical of Israeli settlement expansion and violence.  He appointed evangelical, pro-settlement extremists to key diplomatic posts such as David Friedman, Trump‚Äôs ambassador to Israel, who openly supported West Bank annexation.  He proposed massive arms sales to Israel and regional allies like the UAE, locking in U.S. military dominance in the region for years.  He reversed Obama-era guidance protecting Palestinians from settlement violence.  He signed an executive order that expanded the definition of antisemitism. The order aimed to classify criticism of Israel as antisemitic under certain circumstances, which critics argued was an attempt to stifle free speech and opposition to Israeli policies.  He  praised Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel‚Äôs military operations, even as those operations resulted in significant civilian casualties. One high-profile example was during the May 2019 escalation in Gaza when Israel conducted airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians, including civilians. He insisted they have the right to defend themselves.  ALL OF THE ABOVE HAPPENED IN HIS FIRST ADMINISTRATION  Biden has definitely enabled and protected Israel while talking a softer game than Trump. Trump was much more aggressive in changing U.S. foreign policy around Israel permanently (embassy, Golan, criminalizing BDS protest). Biden is more status quo but that ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù still means thousands of Palestinian deaths.  Biden has absolutely failed Palestinians in horrific ways, no question. His administration has enabled atrocities, upheld the military aid pipeline, and shielded Israel diplomatically while pretending to support ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù That‚Äôs real, and it‚Äôs a deep moral stain.  But Trump? Trump isn‚Äôt just more of the same, he‚Äôs worse. Trump doesn‚Äôt just enable Israel‚Äôs apartheid but accelerates it. He tears up international law, criminalizes dissent at home, and openly cheers for permanent displacement and ethnic cleansing.  He would turn the United States into an even more active participant in Israel‚Äôs war crimes, with no pretense, no brakes, and no way back.  If Biden represents the slow rot of empire, Trump represents setting it on fire and salting the ground where human rights once grew. Both are unacceptable. But one will destroy everything faster, louder, and with more cruelty and take millions more people down with it.  You can hate the choices. You can refuse to play their game.

All while constantly going on about how Israel has a ""right to defend itself,"" which is literally an Israeli state department line, and talking about Oct 7 when thousands of children in Gaza have been massacred.  Harris also told pro-Palestine protesters to shut up at her rally, refused to stray from Biden's foreign policy in any meaningful way, and refused to meet with the leaders of the Uncommitted Movement. She was more concerned with campaigning with Liz Cheney, an imperialist neoconservative with zero constituency, and assuring her voters she would put a Republican on her cabinet.   Refusing to acknowledge any of this not only makes you look gullible and stupid, it makes you look pro-imperialism.

Political loyalty should be earned, not demanded through fear or guilt-tripping. Your frustration is valid and the Democratic Party too often treats leftists like a captive audience, thinking, ‚ÄúWhere else are you gonna go?‚Äù instead of actually offering meaningful, material policies that inspire people to fight for them.  That said, if you still don‚Äôt see the glaring signs of authoritarianism coming from Trump and the GOP, that‚Äôs on you. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúboogeyman‚Äù argument, it‚Äôs observable reality.

You‚Äôre not wrong that Biden and the Dems aren‚Äôt offering enough. They aren‚Äôt. They cater way too much to wealthy donors and water down popular policies because they‚Äôre terrified of real structural change. That‚Äôs absolutely happening.

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfear-mongering,‚Äù it‚Äôs literally what he already did when he had power  Banned trans people from serving openly in the military, robbing thousands of their careers and dignity.  Tried to erase trans identity from civil rights law by defining gender as fixed at birth under Title IX protections.  Rolled back protections for trans students in schools, making it easier for them to be discriminated against and harassed.  Allowed doctors and hospitals to deny medical care to trans people based on ‚Äúreligious beliefs‚Äù including emergency care.  Proposed shelter rules allowing discrimination against trans women in homeless shelters, putting their safety at huge risk.  Appointed dozens of judges with anti-LGBTQ+ records, setting up courts that are openly hostile to trans rights for decades.  Removed questions about sexual orientation and gender identity from federal surveys, making trans people statistically ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù for social services.  Sided with states banning trans kids from sports, setting legal precedents to strip trans people of basic participation rights.  And that‚Äôs just what he did the first time when he had some institutional pushback. This time, he‚Äôs promising to weaponize the entire federal government against his political enemies and that will 100% include trans people, activists, and leftists.

"> There's going to be your disagreement though, to some people funding genocide makes the food inedible.  Well, one side was actively trying to negotiate peace, and the other side was calling for Gaza to be levelled so that Israel could build beach resorts. So there's still no equivalency.  And it definitely doesn't help that there's very real risks of Conservatives committing genocide in America to people who are trans, Latino, autistic, etc. And if you think that's hyperbolic, consider that:  1) RFK Jr is already talking about setting up an autism registry, is digging through private medical records to do so, and has openly advocated for sending people with mental and psychological disorders to ""wellness farms"" to ‚Äúlearn the discipline of hard work‚Äù.  2) Latinos with legal residence and even citizenship have been rounded up without a warrant by ICE. Legal residents have been sent to El Salvador's CECOT without due process. Trump has openly talked about sending US citizens to CECOT and talked to Bukele about building more facilities like it to house hundreds of thousands of prisoners.  3) Republicans have made multiple attempts to make being trans illegal, treat being trans in public as a sex crime, and also to make sex crimes eligible for the death penalty. And Florida passed a bill to make the death penalty ok with 2/3rds of a jury vote (instead of unanimous).   And even if you don't care about any of that and you're just hyperfocused on Palestine... guess what? It's becoming increasingly difficult to protest in favor of Palestine because of the Trump administration's attacks on free speech.
