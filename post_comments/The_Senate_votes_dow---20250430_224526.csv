"I think Trump is under illusion that Chinese factories "" are not doing business"". According to a BBC piece, they already started to focus/ create alternative markets after Trump's first term. I think that is why they are not overheating their phones to negotiate at the moment. I am not a fan of the Chinese government, but at least they know how to read the room & plan accordingly.",Stropi-wan,2025-04-30T23:13:48,5

"People in the Trump cult should be considered lost causes and should never be part of anything Democrats are trying to do. If some find their way out of the wilderness, that's great, but Democrats can't go chasing after them.   Basically, 1/3 of possible voters voted for Harris, 1/3 for Trump and 1/3 didn't vote. All messaging needs to target the 1/3 that didn't vote. Democrats need to call it the Republican recession when it happens, and they need to keep hitting that on every news outlet and social media platform. The 1/3 that didn't vote are mostly still reachable, but Democrats need to be bold and start proposing bold fixes as part of cleaning up what is sure to be a mess.   Stop worrying about Fox News and start fighting for the damn country. If you capitulate to the propagandists, then the country is permanently lost.",pgm_01,2025-05-01T01:57:45,5
