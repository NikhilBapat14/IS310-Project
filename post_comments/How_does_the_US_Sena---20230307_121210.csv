"In the Senate, there can technically be any number of amendments proposed on a bill, and a vote can only occur once all discussion is over. The problem is that any senator can filibuster - delay a vote indefinitely by claiming that they need more time to discuss the bill. Under the current Senate rules, senators don't even need to keep talking to keep a filibuster going. Unless the senator withdraws their motion to filibuster, the only way to move on to a vote is for the majority to hold cloture - where 60+ senators vote to end discussion.  The rules of the Senate are enforced by the Senate Parliamentarian - a non-senator acting as ref. They decide whether bills are ""policy"" or ""spending,"" which affects how quickly bills will pass through the process. Policy bills can be stopped from reaching a final vote by filibuster, whereas spending bills can't and get to go to a vote without cloture being needed.",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-03-07T20:01:53,11
"Just because a bill passed the house does not mean the Senate **needs** to vote on it. That’s your first problem. They are two completely separate bodies, who communicate every now and then to function, but could theoretically exist without any discussion except for some important corner cases (budget, and when the same bill passes both chambers but w slight differences, they need to meet to talk about them, but again, don’t have to, and the bill can die again).",MrLegilimens,2023-03-08T03:21:08,6
"I think you can set up an alert so you get a notification when the status of that bill changes.  I believe once a bill gets proposed, it goes to the appropriate committee within the Senate based on the topic. They do stuff to it and if they think the bill should be a priority relative to other bills, they will put it to a vote. I think it's up to the Majority Leader of the Senate on when to actually vote on the bill or if it will die without ever having been voted on. Say it's a Senate controlled by one party. If the bill is proposed by that party and its popular among the party and they want to push for it, it'll go through committee smoothly.  The Speaker will bring it to the floor like I think schedule it, I think people debate amendments to the bill, and then take a final vote. If it passes the Senate, it goes to the House where I think they do a similar process   If you Google you can find like a map of the procedure and Senate.gov is incredibly helpful for learning everything  It seems from what you describe you want something more engaging that just reading senate.gov so I suggest learning through practice. Take a cause you care about and find a significant bill that was passed on it. Go back and retrace the steps of the bill looking at the website of the steps of the bill moving through the process and looking up articles according to those dates. The articles from the time periods will have explanations in detail of what will need to happen next for a bill to move forward, and sometimes some deeper dives on filibuster or whatever applies to the situation of that bill  Most people don't know the deeper nuances of the Senate rules so articles will do that for u whenever there's a big bill involved. Sometimes you can trace back to where they even got the info from once you learn enough to go back to the bill tracker itself and learn about the process",misschickpea,2023-03-07T23:29:20,3
"The House bill you're following may never get taken up in the Senate, especially since the two bodies are controlled by different parties.   In the Senate, the majority leader controls the calendar. He decides what bills get taken up when. His biggest constraint is time. Until a bill achieves cloture, there's no limit on the time available for debate. Even after cloture, rules allow 40 hours of debate before a vote, which, assuming senators want to keep talking, can mean the Senate can't do anything else until the 40 hours expire. So the majority leader often doesn't bring bills up for consideration unless the outcome of the debate and vote is predictable.",gaxxzz,2023-03-08T07:51:21,2
"Aka the reconciliation process which only requires a simple majority of 51. As opposed toba supemajority of 60. Occasionally, the VP will hold the deciding vote if the Senate is split 50-50. We saw thisba few times the past two years.",The-Insolent-Sage,2023-03-08T07:09:56,3
"Thank you, this is incredibly helpful. I looked through this map of the Senate procedures you mentioned - I couldn't find one on senate.gov, but wikipedia has the following: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Visualization-of-How-a-Bill-Becomes-a-Law_Mike-WIRTH.jpg/2880px-Visualization-of-How-a-Bill-Becomes-a-Law_Mike-WIRTH.jpg  Because I now had a slightly better idea on what to look for, I found the following set of videos, which is mostly what I was looking for: https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process .   I now have some follow-up questions:  - How do I find out which Senate committee is going to work on a bill that made it to the Legislative Calendar?  - In the current Senate, what are the odds of a bill being 'tabled' (i.e. killed) during the committee process, if it is subject to the filibuster and clearly does not have support of 60+ senators? Would a committee recommend a vote on the bill anyway, or would it determine the chances of passing too low and table it?  - When a committee recommends a vote on a bill, I understand now the Senate Majority Leader is not _required_ to actually hold a vote. I'm aware Mitch McConnell had a bit of a reputation for not putting up bills to a vote. Is Chuck Schumer more likely to put up bills to a vote, if a bill passes the committee stage?",[deleted],2023-03-08T09:31:12,3
"I see, so it is very unlikely the majority leader brings up any policy bill with exclusive support from one party, as such a bill would very likely fail to survive the filibuster?",[deleted],2023-03-08T09:35:23,1
Yep. The Majority Leader mostly brings up bills he wants enacted and where he's certain of the votes.,gaxxzz,2023-03-08T09:52:04,1
