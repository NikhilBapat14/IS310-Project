"I feel like it's more a problem with the American people. People love to blame the DNC and the candidates themselves for 2016 and 2024, but I blame the voters.",kerryfinchelhillary,2025-04-30T11:15:34,7
"Based on King Chump's incompetent, hateful, cruel, clueless and ignorant obsession with desecrating and defiling everything the United States of America stands for, and his illegal and unconstitutional refusal to comply with Federal Court decisions and instructions, we have ONE JOB for 2026.  If we don't stand together and get out the anti-Trump vote in the 2026 midterms, there probably will be no going back.  WAKE UP ALREADY!",Nerd-19958,2025-04-30T08:41:04,7
