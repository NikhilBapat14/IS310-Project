"**Mel:** We’ll be trying to answer this question for a long time. My view from the fray is that the administration’s “food the zone” approach has challenged our newsroom and our industry, and yet, we’re still seeing really really powerful work about how the Trump administration is challenging the separation of powers, due process and other keystones of our democracy.  A different version of your question is whether the ways in which our industry is covering these developments is helping voters feel informed and empowered, is helping them cut through the noise to understand what is at stake, and acknowledges the sense of overload and overwhelm we regularly hear from our audiences.  I don’t know the answer to that, but I think journalism that helps people personally relate to the ways in which our country and our democratic norms are being rocked is more effective than telling voters repeatedly that America is on the brink of a constitutional crisis.     \----  **Grace:** I co-sign everything Mel said and would add a note on the current composition of the media industry. Over the past 20 decades, we’ve seen huge job losses and closures of state and local newsrooms, which have been quite devastating for the industry and for democracy.  The concentration of reporters and outlets in Washington, D.C. means that every big national outlet is staffed up with legal and federal government beat reporters who are highly equipped and skilled at covering all the Trump administration’s actions.  I worry not as much about the media’s ability to thoroughly cover all the legal twists and turns, but more about the state and local stories we’re missing about how people are being impacted on the ground.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:05:14,11

"**Grace:** We’re already seeing the impacts on tariffs with the plummeting exports from China to the U.S. Yesterday, I attended a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill featuring two small business owners who run Princess Awesome, a children’s clothing boutique. I thought they gave a really clear and succinct explanation of how tariffs are impacting them, so I’ll share it here:   >*“A tariff is a tax imposed by the American government on Americans. Large corporations may be able to pass these costs onto the customer or absorb the losses, but small businesses like ours cannot. Our largest order of the year out of an outstanding ethical manufacturer in Bangladesh arrived in early March. If it had arrived with President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. In effect, we would have been slapped with a tariff bill for 37 percent of the cost of the production. We quite literally would not have had the money in the bank to pay this unexpected tax. Even at the current new global rate, we will pay 10 percent of our cost of goods directly from our bottom line. We operate on small margins so we can keep our products as affordable as possible. We do not want to raise our prices, which means the business will have to absorb the cost of the arbitrary, unplanned surprise tax.”*      \----  **Mel:** Yes, to Grace’s point, I think some of the most compelling education on tariffs we’ll see will come from impacted businesses, specifically, small business owners who are keenly aware of the impact of tariffs on their products \*and\* can relay that to everyday Americans without too much jargon. The Daily’s [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pfM5v0F9U) with Beth Benike, the founder and C.E.O. of Busy Baby was a stellar example of this.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:06:33,9
"**Grace:** When you’re based in Washington, D.C., as I am, it’s easy to be in somewhat of a bubble, which is why I really value traveling. Democracy suffers when people become atomized and isolated in their bubbles, or simply put, don’t get out and touch grass.     I’ve gotten to go out the road twice so far this year, first in Wisconsin in March and then to a [battleground House district in southern New Mexico](https://19thnews.org/2025/04/new-mexico-trump-100-days/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=19th-social) in April. In both places, I encountered Americans who are active participants in their democracy by organizing and participating in protests, attending town halls and also just getting involved in ways that aren’t expressly political, like volunteering or attending community events, but still create connection with their neighbors.   It’s somewhat of a cliché, but all politics really is local and as it’s where people can have the most impact.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:07:59,9
"**Mel:** It’s really hard to know who, when and how internal push back on this — and many other fronts — will rise up against the current administration.   This was a big question looming over Trump during his first term right up until the end. We know that John Kelly, the Trump White House’s longest-serving chief of staff, was [particularly worried about this issue](https://19thnews.org/2024/10/kamala-harris-trump-john-kelly-warning/) given what he witnessed during Trump’s first term.   We also know that this time around, the administration is much more focused on loyalty as it builds out its ranks. But again, it’s impossible to say.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:08:29,6
"It doesn’t matter as I believe all military take an oath to obey the President and defend the constitution    The oath also stands against any unlawful command given by the president. “THE CONSTITUTION TRUMPS, TRUMP …PERIOD”",MAGUMBONE,2025-05-01T20:48:00,0
"**Grace:** Over the past several decades, we’ve seen Congress as an institution cede a lot of its power and authority to the executive branch. That’s really now coming to a head with the Trump administration withholding or canceling congressionally-appropriated funds and completely sidestepping Congress to impose sweeping tariffs.   And in the wake of their election loss in November, congressional Democrats are contending [with poor approval ratings](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-100-days-tests-future-republican-democratic-parties/story?id=121253288) and an unprecedented deluge of actions from Trump that are completely upending business as usual.   One reason I like covering the U.S. House is that the math is super straightforward: you need 218 votes to win. And when you’re in the minority with two vacancies, as Democrats are, that doesn’t leave you with a whole lot of options.   On the messaging side, different members are taking different tacks and trying different things: progressives like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ro Khanna of California have been [hitting the road](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/bernie-sanders-aocs-political-power-rising-amid-fighting-oligarchy-tour/) with rallies and lots of in-person events to rally the base, while other more centrist members I’ve covered like [Reps. Brittany Pettersen](https://19thnews.org/2025/01/congress-new-parents-proxy-voting-brittany-pettersen/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=19th-social) of Colorado and [Gabe Vasquez](https://19thnews.org/2025/04/new-mexico-trump-100-days/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=19th-social) of New Mexico have sought to find common ground across the aisle on particular issues they care about.",19thnews,2025-05-01T13:09:18,3

"**Grace:** More and more Americans are turning to social media, podcasters and independent creators to get their news over traditional media — a dynamic that poses a challenge for the news industry and is increasingly defining our politics.   And in the 2024 election, those who read the least amount of political news backed Trump by the highest margins. A poll [from Data for Progress released in November](https://www.dataforprogress.org/insights/2024/11/14/what-political-news-engagement-tells-us-about-donald-trumps-victory) showed that those who said they paid “a great deal” of attention to political news favored Vice President Kamala Harris by six points while those who paid “none at all” supported Trump by 19 points.   That’s not at all to say that there aren’t valid critiques of the media’s coverage of Trump’s campaign. But the notion that news coverage from major media outlets significantly contributed to Trump’s win by downplaying his words and policy proposals doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.      \----  **Mel:** Receipts. The Atlantic’s recent piece on Trump’s “comeback” also tells us that the Trump campaign really prized influencers who broadcasted videos and statements of Trump, seeing amplifying his voice as an asset.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:38:03,1

"**Grace:** For context for others reading: [the SAVE Act](https://19thnews.org/2025/03/save-act-voting-married-women/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=19th-social) is Republican-backed legislation that would require citizens to present proof of citizenship (like a birth certificate or passport) when registering to vote. The U.S. House [passed it in April](https://19thnews.org/2025/04/save-act-house-voting/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=19th-social), and it heads next to the Senate, where it has a much steeper path to passage — it would require seven Senate Democrats to vote in favor, which right now seems pretty unlikely.  But voting and election experts we’ve spoken to say the law could make it harder for married women who have changed their last names  to register to vote. New Hampshire has passed a law similar to the SAVE Act and in spring elections this year, local media reported that [several women voters were initially turned away from the polls](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHJo7eApFNI/) because they didn’t have documentation with their married names on it.",19thnews,2025-05-01T12:54:11,2

"An acknowledgement of wrong-doing on their part accompanied by a promise to do better (and evidence of a plan of how to do so)  I see two core problems with the way media has treated Trump up until now: profit motive and trying to avoid being overly critical in the service of trying to appear unbiased. By profit motive, I simply mean that the media loves Trump because all of the drama that surrounds him brings a constant flow of new, shocking developments that drives clicks and engagement. And secondly, in an attempt to try to appear unbiased, the media has often ended up promoting false equivalences, as if fascism deserves equal time with actually legitimate views.",daggah,2025-05-01T14:04:05,3
