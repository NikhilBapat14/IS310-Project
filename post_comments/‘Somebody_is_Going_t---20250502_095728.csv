"""Another judge, John McConnell, also saw his family dragged into it. After he ruled that Trump had no authority to freeze federal grants, far-right activist Laura Loomer posted a photo of his daughter online. Musk amplified it to his 219 million followers on X. That unleashed 600+ calls and emails, many of them threatening violence.""     It seems like legal action can, and should, be taken against both Loomer and Musk.  In any case, you would expect this kind of thing from Lara Loomer, but Elon Musk should know better.",Winter-Gift1112,2025-05-02T12:37:09,17

"I don't think that's what GP is saying at all. Many of us are threatened. Has anyone died yet? (I'm sure the answer is yes, even if for rhetorical purposes and for my own sanity, I'd prefer the answer was no.)  We are all in danger right now. Public servants, perhaps, the least of us - someone has got to stand up to the bully. Anyway, I don't see where GP says anything like what you seem to be accusing them of saying. They just said, freedom isn't free. And gird your loins. Where'd you get that preposterous idea?",yebyen,2025-05-02T10:59:57,3
I do not ever suggest that I know who deserves to die or live.   YOU took that waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far.  I mean......totally out of reality.  So what is your endgame?  What is the point you are going for.  I'm not seeing it.,One_Abalone1135,2025-05-02T11:19:40,-2
"First of all: congratulations on expertly avoiding threatening language so your post doesn't get flagged.   You must do that a lot.  Now...i don't talk about what I do for a living lest my position be exposed.  Nor will I do it now.  Being a public servant wasn't dangerous when I started but it is now.    Anyhow, when I figure out exactly what it is you are trying to say, I might say more. In the meantime, I have work to do.

I know that but We can't look to the other side. We must demand the FBI to take action no matter what. There are thousands of long term FBI agents that will do it even if that cost them a couple of years of their career.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-05-02T12:58:34,12

"I think I see what you’re saying, which is reasonable. Giving OP the benefit of the doubt, I’d agree that’s what’s being said. But at first read, the last sentence sounds like “they deserve it.”",nemontemi,2025-05-02T11:35:10,3
"It sounds like you’re suggesting that death threats are an acceptable level of exposure a federal judge should face (“did they not know that being a public servant might be dangerous”).  I’m disagreeing with that on its face.  Standing up for your convictions, for the Constitution, for the country—which, by and large, judges and all civil servants are doing at this moment—that’s admirable.  But it sounds like you’re telling public servants at large (judges, teachers, clerks, janitors) to suck it up, because that’s what they signed up for.",nemontemi,2025-05-02T12:16:59,2

"Even if the FBI looked into it, and found the people, and somehow decided they were making credible threats that they could pursue charges on, the DOJ would just turn a blind eye once it gets to them.  It still requires prosecutors to prosecute.  I think the FBI should try though, and then the story can be that Bondi is running interference and OK with threatening judges, which she's already expressed she's OK with to some degree.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-05-02T14:17:14,7

"We saw it during the first admin so they’ve all learned their lessons.  The party will single out and punish anyone that goes against the narrative or agenda.  Their seats will never be flipped in most of the Red States.   This means all but a few in contested states will ever fear the citizens voting them out.  They do fear disobeying their own parties marching orders though.  Following guarantees they remain in power forever unless by some miracle the voters grow a brain.  Bottom line they have no morals, principles or backbone. The definition of post MAGA Republican politicians is “greedy coward”.",porkusdorkus,2025-05-04T16:17:45,1
"I don't think that any of us deserves to be in danger. You could of course read it that way, but a more pressing fact remains: all of us are in danger, and some of the dangers are more immediate than others.  It would be ideal, if we could treat the most urgent cases with greater impetus. At the same time, I think that perhaps nobody deserves to be ""out of danger"" any more or any less than anyone else.  GP is right, the time for girding of loins is afoot. For the judges, and for the public servants, definitely not any less so than it is the case for the rest of us.",yebyen,2025-05-02T12:07:18,1
"And THAT explanation is so much more valid than ""Are you suggesting that federal judges—who don’t vote on things like war or the involvement of *enlisted military*—deserve to die?""  I appreciate you rethinking your position.  Why do you think you feel these positions are admirable?  Because they STAND UP for their convictions...your words.  But how admirable is it when they only stand up when it is comfortable or convenient to do so?  What is your solution, new friend? Your head is full of thoughts.  Please share.  If Judges and Clerks and Teachers are being threatened (not only by wackos in the community but by the highest office in the country) what is the solution?  Should they:  a) vacate their position for someone else? if so...who do you think will take their place?  b) stand and carry out their sworn oath to defend the constitution? (if they wish to review the oath they took, there is a print version in their HR file.)  c) maybe some third thing I am obviously not aware of?  Before you answer...please understand that THESE threats are not a surprise.  We knew this was coming.  We warned and begged and plead and marched and voted and yet....folks who insist on the illusions of ""there's two sides to everything"" helped get us here.  I tried to prevent it...I'm trying to stop it.  And you are downvoting my comments because I sound rude.
