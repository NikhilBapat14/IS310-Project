"As a 75 year old MexAm born in La Jolla CA I don‚Äôt think I have any proof of citizenship in my wallet other than my driver‚Äôs license and that doesn‚Äôt have my Citizenship status on it. I don‚Äôt carry my Social Security card or Birth Certificate on me, I have them safely at home. My wallet has Driver‚Äôs license, Credit and Debit cards, miscellaneous detritus, and miscellaneous business cards. My interactions with Cops over the years have been limited to traffic infractions and a DUI in my 20‚Äôs, my citizenship never came up other my home address. I am 3rd gen MexAm but have no accent and don‚Äôt have any strong ethnic features like my siblings. So I guess I rely on my homegrown identity. So if I got caught up in an ICE sweep, I‚Äôd be unable to prove my citizenship, about the rest of you?",johnn48,2025-04-24T18:53:02,5

"From reporter Monica Torres:  In his first few months of office, President Donald Trump has targeted immigrants with tattoos and foreign university students with green cards or visas for deportation ‚Äï and a recent alarming case is raising concerns that U.S. citizens could be next.  Last Wednesday, Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a Georgia-born U.S. citizen, was arrested in Florida and charged with illegally entering the state as an ‚Äúunauthorized alien.‚Äù  Lopez-Gomez‚Äôs case and others like it, along with¬†[rising anti-immigrant sentiment](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-invasion-immigrant-language_l_67f7eca6e4b09493c8d8702f)¬†in general, are raising concerns about whether U.S. citizens need to be carrying proof of their citizenship while they drive or go to bars with friends ‚Äï and if that is even helpful or necessary.      HuffPost talked with immigration experts about what people should know.

"If you insist on driving a wedge between black and brown, be that way -- but if we're going to be pedantic, one out of every four black men voted for Donald John Trump.  Not 10-20%. That would have been nice, and had it happened, we wouldn't be in this pickle.  Especially given that the majority of black people in the US -- try as those in power may to disenfranchise that right -- can actually vote.  A great plurality of Latinos in the US cannot. Latinos in the US also now have to currently worry about possibly being disappeared in a van, regardless of their status.  The minority who have citizenship, can vote, and took the trouble to vote...still voted as a majority for Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump.  Since neither black nor latino (nor presumably afro-latinos) voted for Trump, and since all presently occupy the shit side of the MAGA venn diagram, I hope you will agree with me to drop this stupid argument and focus on what diminishes us, not divides us.",Minute-Plantain,2025-04-25T13:34:03,1
