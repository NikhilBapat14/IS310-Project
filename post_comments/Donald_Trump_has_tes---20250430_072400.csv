"This coming from a man who delights in being nasty, mean, and unempathetic. He sees those different from him as “others” and only people who he relates to as being fully human.

"If you have ever dealt with a family member with dementia, this is their behavior. You give them information to form their ""truth"" - and then they will die on that hill because they are hanging on hard to what their ""truth"" is so that their own brains don't feel lost. My dad is 76 and was formally diagnosed with dementia 3 years ago. At that time, I was appointed guardian over an emergency court hearing, and he was living in very dangerous living conditions (his house was later condemned) and he was neglecting his medical needs. After a blood sugar spike that should have killed him (over 500), I had to bring in first responders to sedate him and remove him from his home so he could get treatment. He was not hurt, it was done with as much grace and care as possible, and they had a team of 5 to help with this situation. His ""truth"" is that I am a mafia leader, I have 'hired goons' that do my bidding, and I have all of the medical professionals on my payroll to control the narrative. He has hung onto that truth for 3 years, and each version gets crazier. He tells every single person he can about how horrible of a child I am, how mean I am, how it's a conspiracy for me to take his assets (.. there are no assets).  DJT was giving a picture and a story, he's hanging onto that ""truth""  and he will die on that hill defending it. He acts just like my father when he's peddling his version. My father can be very convincing to his audience for about the first 20 minutes into a conversation, he acts very stable and normal. It's after that 20 mins that the dementia starts creeping in, the gibberish and ramblings start, the repeating the same information. DJT does this same behavior at his rally appearances that go for more than 20 mins.",_C2J_,2025-04-30T08:21:53,11
