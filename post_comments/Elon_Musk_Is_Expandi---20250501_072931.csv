"From Bloomberg News reporters [Madlin Mekelburg](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AV9QgKt8IJQ/madlin-mekelburg) and [Loren Grush](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AV6nXO-QPVQ/loren-grush):  Some 1,500 miles from Donald Trump’s White House, [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/) is about to put his stamp on a new government.  Residents of the tiny community near SpaceX’s rocket launch site are voting this week on whether to officially incorporate the area as its own city, Starbase, Texas. The outcome is hardly in doubt: Almost all of the eligible voters work for the company or live with someone who does. Musk, who owns a house in the 1.45 square-mile tract, on Memes Street, is all in on the plan to form a new government.  Cementing legal status for the country’s newest company town doesn’t give Musk carte blanche to indulge any and all of his ideas. But the new authority allows SpaceX to build on its decade of growth, with control over zoning, development and more pedestrian aspects of life. As of now, the surrounding Cameron County has to approve construction and sign off on commercial projects. Under its own governance, Starbase would assume those powers, as well as the ability to set — and enforce — rules for residents.",bloomberg,2025-05-01T07:29:52,9

"I'm no Musk fanboy IN THE LEAST, but I'm from this area, and calling this area a ""city"" is disingenuous, that area wasn't developed before started building tiny houses on it.  There was a actual single street neighborhood a few miles before Starbase where he originally lived, which, again, was about 15 houses on a single street.  I see the incorporation as a way to privatize the beach, which we're fighting, successfully so far.  So don't let them distract you with the notion of it being a ""city"" as the reason to be angry, no native residents ever lived there.  This area is about 25 miles from the outskirts of the actual city, of which the full distance on both sides has been relatively undeveloped sanctuary for generations.   https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boca+Chica+Village,+TX+78521/@25.9908837,-97.1831286,1195m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x866fb1632384e2d5:0xa8d0c7f6e909dc99!8m2!3d25.9920073!4d-97.18302!16s%2Fm%2F04bwsps?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D",Aminopup,2025-05-01T08:15:10,4

This is the comment I was looking for. Way too few people know what’s going on. Nation states. Technofeudalism. Peter Thiel. Curtis Yarvin. This is not a minor event. It’s massive but people are talking about the beach and the road because they don’t know the long plan.,Global_Ad8018,2025-05-02T19:19:56,1

"I could be wrong on the history, but I think in the Disney case it was partly the surrounding community that wanted the change because of how expensive it was for the community to support the Disney properties.   That doesn't inherently make it a good thing. I'm not sure why you are asking the question but both can be wrong, whether someone likes Disney and dislikes Musk/SpaceX or vice versa.",blueclawsoftware,2025-05-01T07:54:20,2

"There was no park when Disney got the Reedy Creek Improvement District approved. One of the big drivers as I understand it is that the land that Disney had acquired was in like 3 or 4 different jurisdictions. Any sort of zoning, taxation, permitting, etc. would have been a nightmare to deal with because different parts of the resort would have different rules that applied.   Reedy Creek got approved and Disney became responsible for all the sorts of things that cities usually are, funded by the taxes that they paid into.",wwhsd,2025-05-01T23:36:06,1
