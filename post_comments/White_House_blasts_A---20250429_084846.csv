Amazon better not cave on this. All retailers should start doing this. Put it on the grocery store tags of every damn item. Put it on the gas pumps. Everywhere.,Renagade147,2025-04-29T08:50:36,30

 i mean it's not even dishonest. The prices are literally based on what it cost the company to get it here lol.  People under rocks that go to order more toner for thier printers or whatever and see that the 30 dollars cartridge is now 90 dollars because it came from China is.going to want to know why.  they have to be able to justify this to customers who would otherwise call or write in to complain and blame them for being greedy   If you don't want people upset with your way of governing maybe dont do shit that makes your consituatants angry    Morons    This is what happens when you start fucking with the money...,coatofforearm,2025-04-29T08:59:36,8
"The challenge with the Trump regime is they like to go after single actors.  In this case it's Amazon, who has a lot of power, but they don't mind going after the powerful.  What's needed here is every retailer doing the same so the regime cannot isolate one company,  Obviously American consumers pay the tariffs.  We all knew that.  Companies showing people ""not us"" is just a good business decision.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-29T09:00:18,3

I expect Trump to bully and sue all retailers exposing the real cost of Trump's tariffs.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-29T09:26:57,1
I expect this is Bezos trying to get Trump to back off the tariffs because it's affecting his business,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-04-29T09:34:18,1

I agree. It will maybe shed light on the true cost of a tariff.,19Chris96,2025-04-29T08:56:29,8
"I'd hope Amazon won't either. I wouldn't think they'd back down. At least not quickly as it would make them look weak. Plus they're a huge company and have a lot of stake in this so I think they'd want to put pressure on POTUS, which is what Levitt and others are annoyed about and lashing out like this.",lukeyellow,2025-04-29T08:59:48,3
There's a 99% chance they cut some back door deal with trump and backtrack on this,Unusually_adequate,2025-04-29T09:21:18,2

Amazon must have known doing this would trigger a reaction. this might be Bezos planting a little flag and making trump fall into a trap of his own making.,Exostrike,2025-04-29T09:10:10,0

That's been one my least favorite parts of this looming dystopian future....the fact that ultimately we're all just cheering for our corporate overlords to save us because it's probably the only real way out of this mess.,thenewNFC,2025-04-29T10:07:23,1
