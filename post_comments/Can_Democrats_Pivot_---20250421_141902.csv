If they do it is only in rhetoric and not reality.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-21T17:55:47,5
They can’t.   They have created this hysteria in their followers and they are obliged now to follow their followers into the hysteria that they created in the first place so that their followers could be easily led.  A very sad thing to people who can take several steps back to see the situation.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-21T14:34:48,6

"Even if they did, could you ever trust them? They are the party of deceit.",melie776,2025-04-21T14:57:22,3
"Their center is not the same as THE center.   For them, this would be like pivoting to socialism light.   Democrats are circling the drain and about to be flushed.",MrsKiwi66,2025-04-21T16:09:39,2
"Looking at videos of Clinton and even Obama when they were president sound like they are Republicans today. Meanwhile, the Democrat party apparently has AOC as the frontrunner for 2028. They have learned nothing about the direction the people want the country to go in and continue to go more and more extreme.",RandolphE6,2025-04-21T17:52:03,2
They have gone so far left that moving to the middle would be a betrayal.  They will eat themselves for a long while before they can have a healthier relationship with the middle.,murderinthedark,2025-04-21T15:24:22,1
"Can they drop the made up gender bullshit, child transitioning, the Soros funded DAs that are letting crime run rampant in their cities, their hatred of the first and second amendment, or their love of illegal immigration?   Yes.  Will they they drop the made up gender bullshit, child transitioning, the Soros funded DAs that are letting crime run rampant in their cities, their hatred of the first and second amendment, or their love of illegal immigration?   No.",Xander_hades_,2025-04-21T15:27:29,3
They have no center. They are only anti-Trump. They don't have a strategy or plan.,AppState1981,2025-04-22T07:07:29,1
"They will after they lose a few more elections.      We’re in a repeat of the 1976-1992 cycle where the Democratic Party moved to the center in 1992 after getting their asses handed to them in 1980, 1984, and 1988 for their leftist lunge during and after the Viet Nam war era.      Republicans didn’t seal the deal with the so-called Reagan Democrats (working class, labor Union rank and file) They still identified as Democrat despite voting R for three elections. When Bill Clinton ran on his third way strategy, triangulating Republicans by cleverly stealing their fundamental issues like welfare reform and reduction in the size of the Federal government, the center bought it and elected Clinton twice.",grove_doubter,2025-04-25T20:23:49,1
"They can't because anyone who tries will get removed from the democrat party, and they will just end up changing party affiliation.",caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-21T15:07:11,-1

"I actually think they will, it will probably happen mid /end of Trump's term. Newsom coming out and testing the waters of disavowing identity politics for the toxic dump it's become is just the start.   The Dems will have no but to expel some of this because it cost them dearly.   Just watch as they prep AOC and other's for 2028 they will insist on moderate takes, be ready for some reinventions.",Creski,2025-04-21T16:10:27,7
"I don’t think they can man, they have created a siphon effect of hysteria that the democrat politicians have to just go with otherwise they lose their base.  Every time they try to go to the middle their own constituents pillory them and shame them for being “right wing”.",OzoneLaters,2025-04-21T14:35:46,5
"Pivoting towards the center fails the left's purity tests.  And they all use their purity tests to gatekeep everything, because otherwise there might be a rightwing opinion outside the rightwing quarantine zone. It doesn't just annoy them the way our brigaders annoy us, they invest money everywhere they go to *make sure it never happens.* They hire fire and promote based on ideology, and now that people have risen to the heights of power under that system *they cannot stop the monster they've created.* The monster is doing all the work for their team and the monster's original maker is bedridden.   Anyone who tries to steer their ship away from the iceberg will get the same blowback a full blown *outsider* would get for telling them to change their course.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-21T15:06:18,4
