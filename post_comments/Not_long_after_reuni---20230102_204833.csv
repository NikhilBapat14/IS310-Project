"Germany has a large population, a strong set of natural resources, a decent geographical position, etc. From a purely ""if we made real life into Civilization 6"" kind of perspective, it's really not hard to see why Germany is successful.  I'd also like to argue that Germany's political system is particularly effective, which allows it to create effective laws that then divvy up these various resources effectively across society for the benefit of the political entity and the citizens living within Germany.",mormagils,2023-01-03T08:49:56,34
"It really shouldn't be surprising.  Germany has the biggest population in Europe. It is centrally located in Europe with access to major shipping routes which makes trading easy. It used to have easy access to resources like coal and iron and has a strong manufacturing tradition based on that. It is relatively wealthy, its population is well-educated.   There is no specific German advantage other than that it is a big country in the middle of the most developed region on earth that has built wealth on its resources and maintained it. Germany and its predecessors have always been relatively wealthy and important in Europe. West Germany alone was the strongest economy and the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional military force in in Europe, so the re-unification has little to do with it.",Poebbel,2023-01-03T04:35:01,30

"It's unusual that you are marking reunification as the pivot in this context. Normally people wonder why Germany's economy came roaring back from utter devastation in WWII, which is also known as the so-called ""Wirtschaftswunder"" (Economic Miracle). Many of the answers in this thread answer that question (to explain the miracle after 1945), instead of the one you asked (""becoming strongest"" after 1991).  FWIW, by 1989-1991 (reunification), West Germany was a power house, and East Germany was... well, pretty good for a Warsaw Pact country. Redistribution of wealth between the wealthy west and the less developed east places a continuing strain on inner-German politics.   FWIW, when talking about Germany and Germans without specifying a time frame, it can be more difficult to nail down what is meant than people give credit. Things in that part of the world have been... messy. However, there was the German ""unification"" in 1866-1871 where a territory that kind of overlaps with the current territory was brought under the control of a single government (that's why post-war unification is called ""re-unification""). And then there's the people who define ""German"" by pointing to some ultimately pretty heterogeneous group of tribes in central Europe who more or less shared a language identifiable as German. Germany in it's current form is 32-ish years old, and in it's current constitution is from 1949.",space_monolith,2023-01-05T18:40:10,3
"Large population, largely protestant work ethic, great riparian communications aiding heavy industry, decent agricultural lands on the North German Plain, and NATO relieving them of the need for significant self defense expenditures.",RingAny1978,2023-01-09T14:33:09,2
"They had all the enforced loans they received from countries like Greece written off essentially. They didn't have to pay any reparations for destroying the whole continent. They benefited mightily from the marshal plan. And they got to have cheap foreign labour sucking all the youth of working age from the countries they wrecked who had no other real job prospects in their own countries cause they were wrecked by Germany in ww2.  For decades the energetic of the European south flowed into Germany in the form of unskilled and skilled labour. Labour who's own countries paid to raise and often train.   All this so they could act as a bulwark against communism and the hated GDR and a poster child for democracy and Western values.  On top of that the German multinationals who profited from ww2 never really gave up their gains. IBM Germany, Volkswagen, ford even coca cola German subsidiaries where just reunited with their mother companies and they were no awkward talks about slave labour or war profiteering.  Finally they created the euro which is just a mechanism to easily turn porrer European countries fiscal deficits into German surpluses. A way for German conpanies to really boost their exports while the south can't really compete industrially.   It would beba wonder if they didn't go on to become a leader. Looting all the continents wealth and getting pumped full of loans, cheap foreign loans and exports can work wonders.",hariseldon2,2023-01-03T17:02:37,-2
"In WWII, Germany out-engineering themselves.  They made stuff that was designed to last for 5-6 years that the allies destroyed in the matter of months.  A lot of wasted effort.",TexasYankee212,2023-01-03T12:35:53,-4
"Germans are kind of stereotyped for their strong work ethic and no nonsense, somewhat humorless behavior. My mother, whose an American who has German heritage, is kind of like that. Basically, cultures like that that embrace hard work and hustle culture like Indian immigrants, Japanese and Germans are easily able to compete in the global market.   Not trying to paint this as a bad thing, I myself embrace that attitude in my life.",Pure-Huckleberry8640,2023-01-12T05:31:21,1
"Looking at politics... If there ever was one, it is gone by now!  I would say that the generation that was born in ww2 and the kids who were raised by this generation were way more obeying and trying to be honorable members of society, where as now everybody is kind of lazy and or only looking at themselves. There used to be more understanding of being a community, contributing to it and striving as a community.  I would say it was a mix of sense of community and poverty mixed with skilled workers and human capital. We still have human capital, but we are not as innovative as we used to. There is not a real sense of investing and inventing. Doing business comes along with tons of regulations and administrative stuff. We have plenty of people working for government who do useless jobs. Look at the tax system for example. It is so complicated that even experts dont fully understand it. So lots of people are working for gov or in tax advisory instead of doing productive labour.  There is a strong Zeitgeist especially amongst younger people that we should take from the rich aka business people and give to those who have less, thinking it would benefit society. There is a lot of envy you could say. People here love to complain instead of trying to work it out for themselves.",mo_makes_money,2023-02-26T21:10:17,1

"Why did folks who wanted to work go to Germany rather than work at home?  Disfunctional government in the south of Europe.   Germany was every bit as damaged, if not more so, as the conquered south.  What they did not have were communist revolutions or near revolutions (Greece, Italy).",RingAny1978,2023-01-09T14:36:52,0

A quick research will prove you otherwise. The [forced loans](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/greek-study-provides-evidence-of-forced-loans-to-nazis-a-1024762.html) and [war reparations](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-says-germany-refused-talks-ww2-reparations-2023-01-03/) are a topic of heated political discussion all over Eastern Europe. [Gastarbeiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter) were a thing that drained southern Europe and were allowed in through official political agreements. [Slave labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_involved_in_the_Holocaust) was a thing. Surely the [compensation](https://www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de/en/zwangsarbeit/entschaedigung/entschaedigung-2/index.html) paid to some victims is laughable.  [Germany pre war debt forgiveness and accommodation](https://www.france24.com/en/20150129-london-agreement-1953-debt-write-germany-economic-miracle-greece-austerity) contributed to its prosperity.  Finally the Euro [favours](https://www.dw.com/en/cep-study-germany-gains-most-from-euro-introduction/a-47675856) Germany significantly while it [harms](https://www.cep.eu/Studien/20_Jahre_Euro_-_Gewinner_und_Verlierer/cepStudy_20_years_Euro_-_Winners_and_Losers.pdf) other European countries.,hariseldon2,2023-01-04T00:42:29,-1
More like wrecked infrastructure and destroyed economies. The Germans blew bridges and railways and stole truckloads of gold from the central banks. These damages were never paid back and the loot was not returned.,hariseldon2,2023-01-09T14:46:41,1
"I can give a brief description. They have a lower house where representation is by where you live. You can vote for a person who usually is a member of a national party gunning to represent your area. It’s not entirely unlike the US House of Reps.  The upper house is where it gets interesting - representation there is based on party alone, so you can vote for whatever party you like. Say you vote for the Soda In The Drinking Fountains party, that marginally increases the number of seats the SITDF gets in the upper house.   So they get this really nice mix of representatives who are accountable to localities and representatives who are accountable to folks’s often very particular views of how the nation aught to be governed.  As a result, they have a lively political scene with many healthy, vibrant, and above all, *cooperative* political parties all vying for mind share and eager to cut deals with each other to get their constituents something.   Of course, this is a bit of a rose colored view, but it’s orders of magnitude better than bitterly divisive two party duopoly we have in the US, where both of the two major political parties is actually a coalition of anywhere from 4-5 distinct philosophical groups each that are forced to caucus together or be completely irrelevant.",9d47cf1f,2023-01-03T18:14:33,5
"Well it was a monarchy so having one person in charge helps. They also have a long history of military discipline and culture which helps.   Food for thought, the cardinal of France who ruled as regent until Louis 14th grew up said that the unification of Germany would spell the end of France and he basically admitted that the hundreds year war of religion was basically just to prevent Germany from unifying as long as possible and had nothing to do with religion.",Polysci123,2023-01-03T13:45:14,5

"That is not quite correct. The Bundestag (lower house) is made up of both representatives who were elected directly and those who came in from a party list. Each voter has two votes, the first (for a person) determines your local rep, the second (for a party) determines the number of seats each party gets in the Bundestag and ultimately who will be in government. The Bundesrat (upper house) represents the Bundesländer (states), where each has a number of votes roughly based on their share of the population and controlled by the state government.",Poebbel,2023-01-05T08:29:15,6
