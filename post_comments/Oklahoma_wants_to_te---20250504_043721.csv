"I said this in a similar previous thread but my school definitely followed a similar ""patriotic"" style of teaching where we just focused on history where Americans were war heroes. I went to high school in the mid 2000s and our history classes generally ended at WW2. I did not have a single class even bring up the Vietnam War until college, much less anything else happening in the many decades between WW2 and the mid 2000s (except for a very brief mention of the civil rights movement for black history month).   So while this is obviously disgusting, from my experience in school I can't even fathom a kids history class covering anything that *recent*. Are kids now getting up to the second history education or would these kids get the patriotic education I got and have their classes skip from WW2 to Trump, maybe with a brief lesson on how we totally won the War on Terror somehow in the middle",netabareking,2025-05-04T05:42:45,17

"A good teacher:  The sitting president and his cronies repeatedly claimed the election was ""stolen"" without producing any proof. The trump campaign pocketed incalculable amounts of money from their ""impressionable"" supporters, with the belief the funds would go to fighting the election results in court. The only evidence of the election being rigged was the outburst of a delusional old man, nothing else was ever produced in any of the multiple court cases brought about across the country, state recounts confirmed the election results, and judges dismissed and warned the campaign about frivolous lawsuits. As a last resort the sitting president pressured his vice president and states to not certify the election results and  rounded up his supporters for a rally on the day election would officially be certified by the USHoRs, Jan 6. During this rally the mass of people matched to the capitol building and broke in under the direction of the president, the reps were evacuated and many Republican reps who supported the presidents bid to override the election fled and hid with their tails tucked scared, such a Josh Hawley. People died that day who shouldn't have, all at the bid of the president. The election was certified regardless. The events of that day would later be investigated by multiple parties, all leading to the same conclusion, the events of Jan 6 were preplanned by the campaign (at least) but it is suspected that the president was directly involved with the planning. However because of the slow processes of the judicial system and appeals of menial things the trump legal team successfully dragged out the court cases until one was appealed to the USSC to argue for overarching presidential immunity in which the USSC found in his favor. By this time another election was imminent in which trump won, wrapping all of the cases against him because he could just pardon himself and everyone involved, it should be noted he under no circumstance successfully defended that 1. The 2020 election was rigged, 2. His actions in an attempted coup of the federal government. All Jan 6 rioters were pardoned after he took office again. And the events will likely repeat themselves on a larger scale in 2028, if not before.",pm_me_ur_ParusMajors,2025-05-04T06:56:37,4

"I listened to SCOTUS oral arguments the other day in a case involving an OK charter school that wanted to do a Catholic curriculum.   The charter school board approved the application and some group sued saying essentially that charter schools become part of the state's public school system and public schools in OK are prohibited from teaching religion.  That, on its face it patently obvious, but not to the conservative justices, especially Kavanaugh (who is a dumb motherfucker, BTW).  They seemed very keen to paint it as religious discrimination, endlessly comparing schools to cake shops and adoption services.  ""How are they different?""  Private entities and public schools are different in every way.  ""Parents can choose not to send their kids there.""  And OK taxpayers have already chosen not to fund religious schools. That's why it's written into law. That's what the establishment clause is about in the US Constitution.  This Catholic school becoming part of the OK public school system and receiving public funding violates OK law and the US Constitution, but conservative justices are all, ""But my religion...?""

"Well it's not even that they won't be taught this yet, it's more of a question of what history classes look like now and in the specific schools they're trying to push this into. I don't know if maybe unlike my experiences they don't learn history on a ""just stuff from when your grandma was young and earlier"" delay or if they are learning only stuff that old but with some bizarre unit on Trump's presidency.   Either way it's terrible, but it might be terrible and VERY WEIRD.",netabareking,2025-05-04T23:22:04,1
"Correct. I assume rural Kentucky and Connecticut do not have the same curriculum. I also don't even assume that my same school NOW has the same curriculum. The problem is the US allows a really massive range of stuff in schools and so you absolutely get this huge spectrum of quality.

That's insane. My NC history class in middle school had pretty accurate coverage of the civil war and civil rights movement. It might have been overly critical of Reconstruction as a project -- we glossed over stuff like the Wilmington Insurrection and white terrorists undoing the success of the Republican/Populist Fusion party post-reconstruction -- but we still learned about Jim Crow and the Klan and everything.,Semantix,2025-05-04T07:51:46,14
You and your classmates were very fortunate to be taught both sides of humanity.  Maybe not enough but a far cry from what other school boards allowed.  They did their job ….. educate the next generation to do better.    Without the basic awareness history is bound to repeat itself.,Silly-Ad8796,2025-05-04T08:31:30,10
"Makes me realize how lucky I was to grow up in an area where the schools taught fact and not fiction.  Heck, one of my history teachers was also a civil war reenactor, but for the union.  He was even an extra in Gettysburg.    When I was younger and more naive, I chalked up differences in education to other factors.  Lower budgets, older textbooks, underpaid teachers, run down buildings, even general apathy.  But the reality goes far deeper and is far worse than that.",Zaratus27,2025-05-04T12:18:18,3

That’s wild it’s taught like that in Ohio. I grew up in Northeast Ohio and we learned the proper way that the civil war was over slavery. We also had a whole unit that was about how Hitler took power and the Holocaust before the WW2 unit.,MasterofPandas1,2025-05-04T17:56:08,1
"I'm really grateful you had the opportunity to grow past that. Racism is learned and taught, and your parents had the responsibility to raise you to be kind, thoughtful, and caring. Unfortunately, you had to take that upon yourself. You did the right thing and learned to address and took accountability for that racism that was thrust upon you and indoctrinated in. I feel repulsed by what I saw and the lessons they tried to teach me. I rejected it once I had empathy that my parents never seemed to develop.  My mother was from Ohio and brought Confederate flags up from the south when we moved up to Ohio. I had been fighting against my parents to support civil rights. I mocked them by printing out and hiding pictures of Obama everywhere when he won in 2008 lol.   You're insightful and responsible to address those biases.",FastFoxFast,2025-05-04T12:31:08,2

"Imagine how much worse things would have been for the freed slaves, though. From a modern perspective at least, ""saving the union"" is more about trying to stop Southern white supremacists from just organizing full-on pogroms and less about any desire to continue to share a country with them.   I worry about that now, if the US balkanizes -- yeah, the coasts and upper midwest will be way better off, but minorities in the South will be in living hell.",Alict,2025-05-04T10:58:44,2

Blaming rural populations must be easier than acknowledging Trump as a white problem. ,BbCortazan,2025-05-04T14:16:02,1
"I don’t think you can blame rural people for Trump. It feels like you’re using them as a scapegoat — rural people can be leftists too, and even if most of them aren’t, the real blame lies in the rich and powerful running billions of dollars of propaganda to target those people. I also want to blame the democrats for abandoning rural working people in pursuit of the managerial class, and I certainly wanna blame institutional republicans for allowing MAGA to happen.  I realize that ignorance doesn’t mean you hold no responsibility, but I’m a little uncomfortable, being an Appalachian myself, hearing someone say that rural voters fucked it up for the “rest of the country”. This isn’t an us vs them, Manhattan shifted red this election as well. My county as 80/20 for Trump and there were protests in it on the front page of Reddit the other day!   The reason Kamala lost wasn’t because too many hilljacks came out to vote, it was because not enough Dems did. She framed herself as exactly the same as Joe Biden, and your average poor person doesn’t want the same. Was it a bad choice? Yea, but propagandists can indeed make people vote against their interests.  Anyway, put some respect on rural people.
