"> It gives the power for this task force to investigate literally every government agency and remove policies that ""violate Christian values  And this is the big problem here.  They‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre investigating ‚Äúanti-Christian policies‚Äù to make it sound like they‚Äôre concerned about policies that are discriminatory against Christians.
