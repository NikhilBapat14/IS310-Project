"This is the real story. People stop buying things, and this all collapses very quickly. Not having things to buy as pre-tariff supplies are sold through will only accelerate the collapse. Not to mention the resulting inflation of our new found scarcity.",doughnaltramp,2025-04-26T00:30:10,11

Only 8%? That’s pretty amazing.,BL0w1ToutY0A55,2025-04-26T00:58:56,2
"I’ve dramatically curbed my spending since the new year. Chaos in the markets means my job is at risk. The market drops 5/10/15%, Wall Street has a model for how many jobs to cut.   I hope I don’t lose my job but I need to save to increase my emergency fund, it’s a brutal job market and it’s not going to get better under Trump.  What if my spouse and I BOTH lose our jobs? Never seen conditions where that could happen (even in 2008 and COVID!) but it sure seems possible now. ",sf_sf_sf,2025-04-26T16:21:07,1

Soon they don’t have to worry about money in the wallet. Because there is nothing to buy…,MaydayZulu,2025-04-26T00:23:10,7
"To be fair it’s only 8% from last month, not 8% total. So 8% in a month can be a lot. I do agree though after the stock disaster and tariff chaos it does seem it should be higher",Lostsock1995,2025-04-26T09:02:43,4
