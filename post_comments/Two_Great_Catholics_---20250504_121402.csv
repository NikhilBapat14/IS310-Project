"I love how I always forget that Biden is Catholic bc through his presidencies, he never made a thing about it. His religion was part of his personality but not his presidency. He was totally sane and normal about it.",Miami_Mice2087,2025-05-04T18:07:04,10

"Pope Francis wasn’t even remotely left wing by the standards of most of the world. His positions on many issues were quite traditionally conservative. He just happened to endorse *all* the traditional Christian values, including the ones that conservatives have completely tossed out the window over the last few decades.",jmurphy42,2025-05-04T18:31:51,8

"Downvote away, but I really don't care how offended The Church is, nor am I particularly concerned about the huge number of cafeteria Catholics who are clutching their pearls. They didn't seem this outraged when Trump stood in front of a church holding the Bible upsidefuckingdown or any of the Christo-fascist things he has done. Ping me when Christendom is this angry over the ""Religious Liberty Commision"" EO just signed by Trump.",VaguelyArtistic,2025-05-04T14:00:45,19
