">Washington has rightly denounced China’s military escalations, but it has so far overlooked Lai’s subtler political escalations. The Trump administration should rein in Lai before he mistakes Washington’s passivity for approval and entangles the United States in a potentially calamitous war.  I'm not sure I would call boosting defense spending, implementing civil-defense training programs, and asserting their status as an independent and sovereign nation ""escalations"", especially not in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, considering it is China who is threatening Taiwan with invasion, not the other way around. Taiwan is smart to be taking these threats seriously and trying to better prepare themselves.",pragmatichokie,2025-05-04T22:26:25,23

Tawana is an independent country that will do as they please.  Besides he put tariffs on them too.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-04T22:41:56,7
"China PRC dwarfs Taiwan in military capacity and has nuclear weapons. Taiwan is limited to a meager defense of the island. But to the authors, both from the Carnegie Endowment, ideas of an independent Taiwan and the steps necessary to keep it that way are a threat to peace. A functioning democratic country with a relatively free press is the problem. Obviously, the article has the situation exactly backwards. But why? Have China PRC interests bought influence at Carnegie?",bloopbloopkaching,2025-05-04T22:54:48,8

"Even with all the military build-up spending hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no path to China being able to seize Taiwan by force.  They can wreck it, but even that might have an unbelievable price.",jphamlore,2025-05-05T13:50:40,1

"It can be argued that when China built the Three Gorges Dam, they made Taiwan capable of Mutually Assured Destruction without even owning nukes.  If China invades, Taiwan is going to fire guided missiles into that structure and kill millions of people in the ensuing floods. Because if they (the Taiwanese) are dead anyway from China attacking them, they have no reason not to.",CrashB111,2025-05-04T23:07:39,3

"Ever since the PRC has proven that successful capitalistic enterprise is compatible with a non-democratic government, our betters have been doing everything in their power to reduce democracy in the US and abroad. In ignoring the example of Vladimir Putin's Russian Federation, our betters will now have another major example of why successful capitalistic enterprise is incompatible with a kleptocratic non-democratic government.",eric_ts,2025-05-05T00:28:57,1
"""Peace at all costs"" could very well be a self selected stance. I just hope that there is in the future something other than the traditional appeasement v. hawk entrenchments. Either could just as easily lead to ww3. If China PRC is allowed to crush Taiwan-- where will it stop? But, for an extreme e.g.,  allowing Taiwan to go nuclear would prob hasten invasion too...",bloopbloopkaching,2025-05-04T23:40:45,2
