"It’s an interesting issue.  If they don’t, then they’re just going to create a permanent hidden underclass and all the problems that come along with that. It’s the same with hiring. Yes it’s illegal to hire someone without a work visa. But if these refugees don’t work then they will fact turn to crime and such to live. And they’ll still be better off than where they came from.",[deleted],2025-04-25T09:22:31,6
Teach em to read & they might not want to do manual shit jobs for less than minimum wage.,ShinePretend3772,2025-04-25T09:24:44,5
"> A measure that would allow schools to refuse undocumented students is likely dead for the 2025 legislative session.  > A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given the potential loss, House leadership paused consideration of the bill after it passed the Senate earlier this month.  > The House version of the bill would allow schools to choose whether to check students’ immigration status, while the Senate version would mandate it.  > […]  > The legislation was intended to challenge a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that established the right to education for students, regardless of immigration status.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-25T09:18:01,1
"All I'd care about is if their parent's pay taxes. Either way it's hard to say no, because you are right, we'd just be creating future adults that are going to have to earn money one way or another, and when people feel like they don't have options, that's when they turn to crime.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T09:47:15,2
"There's also the human rights of children, lest we get too bogged down.",Logical_Hare,2025-04-25T10:08:16,3
"I mean, an orphan doesn’t have parents that pay taxes, but they still deserve an education. Education for children is a benefit to society.",bowshows,2025-04-25T10:59:30,3
"I don't know if I'd call it a human rights issue.  What makes it unfair for all is; class sizes are already too big, schools are underfunded, teachers are underpaid and have more students than they have time to give individual attention to. That is with our current system and the funding the schools get from people paying state taxes. Adding a bunch of kids without the additional tax revenue just exacerbates the problem and lowers the quality of education for everyone.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T10:11:40,-1
"They have a legal guardian of some sort though. That's not the issue though. Schools would need more funding. Books, lunches, staff, facility size etc.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T11:39:26,0
"Here’s a good idea, we can just cap class sizes at 15 and if your kid doesn’t get a spot that’s your problem. I mean sure it’s important that your kid gets educated but think of the class sizes! /s",Jakemcclure123,2025-04-25T10:18:08,0
So your saying it's not an issue and instead of putting some actual thought into a real problem you want to try lame attempts at humor?,Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T10:22:18,-1
"I’m saying it’s a real issue but the solution isn’t that we should throw any kids under the bus to “fix” it. Of course we should put more funding into public education, but excluding kids from the classroom isn’t a solution.  Class sizes have often been used as not a reason why we shouldn’t include “undesirable” students into public schools going back to integration. If we want to actually fix public schools, we should just hire more teachers and pay people better to attract more people to the profession.",Jakemcclure123,2025-04-25T10:28:28,3
