">A federal court ruled Thursday that Alabama engaged in intentional discrimination when it refused to draw a congressional plan with a second Black majority district after courts, including the Supreme Court, repeatedly rejected maps with just one such district.   > Yet the legislature, given the opportunity to redraw the map, refused to enact a plan that included a second congressional district that would allow Black voters to elect the candidate choice, sticking instead to a map that had only one majority-Black district.  >A court-appointed expert drew a temporary map for the 2024 election, and, for the first time in 150 years, Alabama elected two Black people to its congressional delegation that year.

Republicans love gerrymandering.   My medium size city was literally cut in half in the last Congressional redistricting map. Republicans in my red state couldn't win because in a sea of rural America say my blue University-heavy city.

"Global warming is a *direct* reference to anthropogenic climate change. It waters it down by saying climate change as, everyone can agree, that climates change.

"They say that either way.   In 1989 when the term global warming took a hot seat in people’s ears it was specifically referring to how WE humans are effecting the climate with our greenhouse gases. I remember it being a topic in school that we discussed and people treated it like a concern. Over time people started using climate change to indicate the broader effects that our greenhouses gases may have on the climate, but it inadvertently watered down the issue and shifted the narrative from US being responsible to ‘climates change naturally.’   The globe IS warming, we ARE responsible. These are facts, and the impact they had on our attitudes towards those facts at the time were way more extreme to us than what people have today. Climate change sounds like something we can adapt to, global warming sounds like a problem we caused and need to fix.    In the end the term really provokes an apathetic response for those that DO believe the science. Climate change deniers will deny global warming outright, and claim we have no effect on climate change.",Respurated,2025-05-09T13:43:09,0
"Ffs.   You don't need to assume i don't believe in it and lecture me about the truth just because i corrected you slightly.  Yeah, that do say that either way, that's my point.  Warming doesn't imply it's anthropogenic any more than change does.  Maybe to you, but that's your personal perception of those words other people don't share.  Not definitional.",dog_ahead,2025-05-09T14:13:33,0
"I wasn’t assuming you were a climate denier, sorry if it came off that way. I was simply trying to imply that with the term global warming we were the root cause of the issue, not a cog in the wheel.    It’s not just to me, I remember many people downplaying the severity of the situation when the rhetoric switched from global warming to climate change in general.    I realize that climate change is a more encompassing and correct term for the effects we’re having on the environment. But it allowed serious people to have some wiggle room where they could get lost in the more complicated climate systems.    Global warming was pointing the blame finger directly at us. Climate change puts us in the mix of everything else. It initially had a cooling effect on attitudes towards global warming. I mean look at all the laws that were passed to help fix the hole in the ozone layer, it was like people were rightfully scared of what we’ve done to the planet.    Apparently that has been finally overcome because recent studies show that most people find the terms synonymous, and the main stigma surrounding whether or not you think climate change is an issue is related to your political beliefs and party affiliation.",Respurated,2025-05-10T09:32:30,1
