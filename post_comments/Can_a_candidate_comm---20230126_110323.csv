"A campaign committee is usually a non-profit tax exempt organization. It is not an LLC, and is usually not required to have any specific type of organization (but it usually just called a PAC. In order to run for office, you can usually just file with your state or the federal campaign commission, and then take that paperwork to the bank to open an account. I've opened a few dozen, and while the exact requirements vary state to state, there's not a lot that is usually required for it.  As a result of that, there cannot be a holding company or parent organization for campaigns or other PACs.",CaitlinHuxley,2023-02-01T20:10:03,2
