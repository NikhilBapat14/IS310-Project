"From the article:  [the article](https://archive.is/2025.04.29-180644/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article305235491.html%23webview=1)   Another group critical of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation campaign and funding cuts to pro-democracy groups in the Americas is launching an ad campaign on Miami’s highways and airwaves to pressure Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Miami’s Republican U.S. representatives to stand up to the president. A spokesman for Keep Them Honest said Sunday that the newly formed dark-money organization — which does not have to disclose its donors — has erected billboards on the Palmetto Expressway, Don Shula Expressway and Florida Turnpike criticizing Reps. Mario Díaz-Balart, María Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gimenez in their districts. “Deporting good immigrants back to dictatorships is cruel,” states an ad that the group began running Monday on MiamiHerald.com. Seven total billboards will carry the message over South Florida’s highways, said Chris Wills, a spokesman for the group. He said Keep Them Honest, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, has also been running digital ads in the congressional members’ districts. Wills said the goal is to pressure the politicians to stand up against Trump. “They have the ability to make demands for what we know traditionally these members of Congress have said they have stood for,” said Wills, “which is to defend the rights of those who have fled dictatorships and have come to this country seeking the American dream.”",LurkerFromTheVoid,2025-04-29T13:23:12,6
