"By Jesus Mesa — Politics Reporter |  A growing number of Venezuelan voters in South Florida, once among President Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, are rethinking their allegiance as his administration's moves on immigration have taken a toll on their fellow citizens.  A new poll released Monday by Florida International University's Latino Public Opinion Forum shows the GOP is losing its grip on this crucial voting bloc, as the White House moves quickly to end protections for Venezuelan migrants and ramp up mass deportations.

They got high on their own supply: ""Democrats are communists and we left Venezuela to because of communism!""   What they fail to process with their 1 remaining brain cell is that what the GOP claims to want/do is not inline with their actions. Every step they've taken for as long as I've been alive is consolidating power, ensuring that the wealthy keep their money, privatize social programs, and eradicate the middle class.

They are considered to be immigrants (which they view as bad) and no better than the Mexicans. You can see that in Trump’s immigration policies.

">They totally ignore people like the Cubans who are trying so hard to be white.  To be fair a lot of Cubans are literally white. They're of Spanish descent. However, white Hispanics seem to not understand that American white supremacy is Nordicist in character, so Anglos think anything south of the Pyrenees might as well be Africa and if you're slightly olive-toned, you're not actually white despite being 100% genetically European.  You're right about the Mexico thing. I remember seeing a story on reddit where someone said they were from Argentina, and their friend asked ""what part of Mexico is that?"". As a kid I got asked if Cuba was part of Mexico. They just think it's all Mexico. Even when they're aware of the existence of other Spanish-speaking countries, they still think these countries are *like* Mexico, that they look like Mexicans and eat the same food and have the same culture.

"I would argue that the type of people who voted for Trump are generally not empathetic people.  And those type of people really wouldn't regret something they did when it negatively affects other people, but they may when they are affected by it.  So since they're not feeling the pain yet, they wouldn't care.  And honestly, most people have not felt the real pain yet.   We have one side that's warning that the widespread pain is coming while the other side doesn't believe it will touch them.  The only thing that could possibly change that second group of people's minds is if they really feel pain. Otherwise they will be satisfied with their actions.  Susan Sarandon caught a lot of shit in 2016 pretty much saying the same thing.   Republican voters will not change until they get what they voted for.   And unfortunately the rest of us couldn't convince them from staying away from the hot stove and they're probably going to get burned.
