"3 is actually the proper number of EVs for DC to have based on its population. The most overrepresented state I believe is actually RI, because they juuuust sneak over the threshold for having two reps. I believe it has \~200k, or about \~25% more people than Vermont and twice the Reps.  The problem with DC is that they don't have Senators.",Miles_vel_Day,2025-03-30T09:10:42,71

Absolutely.  I think a much tougher question is why should that right come with the formation of a new state instead of being DC being folded back into Maryland or absorbed by Virginia.

We could do some fun stuff like eliminate the states dei initiative called the electoral college. Then every person's vote counts as one vote and we stop talking about a large state like California wielding more power than a small state.

"The fact that there are any Americans who can't vote for members of Congress to represent them is, frankly, outrageous.   DC should either be absorbed into one of the surrounding states, or it should be given its own representation in Congress. Anything else is very undemocratic.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-03-30T23:39:41,3
"Absolutely - at least because the budget (funded by DC residents taxes) being controlled by the House has made the DC budget funding a political propaganda tool, and effectively a slush fund that can be, and has been, raided at will with no due process, by forcing budget cuts on them.  So far, the GOP has been responsible for these abuses, but it could theoretically be any party with a House majority.  While residents can vote for President, and a city government, their only voice in either house of congress is an elected House Congressional Rep that HAS NO VOTE.  This means they have a form of taxation without representation.  They do not get to control how their own city operates.    Granting statehood would remove these what would be otherwise unconstitutional abuses and inequities, but for the 23rd Amendment, and granting the citizens the same full rights everyone else has.  Further, Article 2, Section 8 of the constitution authorizes congress to control a district no larger than 10 miles square, ""as may become the seat of government of the United States.""  There is no mention of a MINIMUM size,and the ""seat of government of the US,"" being used to describe any part of DC than the national mall and surrounding buildings owned by the US government, is absurd.  NE is NOT the seat of government.  Anacostia is not the seat of government.  Georgetown is not the seat of government.  So, what could easily and fairly quickly be done, is just limit the constitutionally-required ""district,"" to the national mall area, and grant statehood to the rest of DC, or even ceding the rest back to MD has been suggested, but rejected by DC residents.  The support for statehood is probably at an all-time high right now.  GOP objects solely on political grounds - DC is 90+% Dem.  So, they argue it's giving the Dems some kind of unfair advantage with 2 additional senate seats, and the additional AND VOTING house seats.  The argument is OBVIOUSLY not a constitutional reason to refuse to address the existing inequities, and ignores the fact that these seats should have ALREADY been granted to these citizens a very long time ago and has been, by their logic, grossly unfair to the Dems since the 60's-70's (when the racists all changed to the GOP, and African Americans changed to the Dems).  But it has been enough to prevent a bill passing both houses, and either getting signed by the President, or overcoming a veto.  If the Dems ever get back control or both the legislative and executive branches, I'm pretty confident DC would be granted statehood.  Now, would a challenge find it's way to SCOTUS?  I'd bet on it.  Up until recently it wouldn't worry me at all, but nowadays - let's put it this way - if they were willing to make up some BS from whole cloth about Presidential immunity, they could be willing to do the same ""creative"" interpretation of article 2, section 8 to prevent it - especially if it meant the GOP would not be likely to get a majority back in either the Senate or House again, which would be likely for as long as the GOP and Dems would remain fixed to the platforms they have right now, or at least relatively as far apart on their priorities.",beltway_lefty,2025-03-30T06:50:26,10

"Honestly, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, we should just go back and pass the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment that was proposed back in 1978. It was already approved by Congress with the necessary two-thirds majority and sent to the states for ratification. The amendment would’ve given D.C. full representation in the House and Senate and participation in constitutional amendments—treating it like a state for voting purposes while still allowing Congress to legislate over the district if need be, but maintaining home rule by statue.  It fell short by just a handful of state ratifications before the seven-year deadline expired. But the amendment is still out there, and Congress could just re-propose it without a deadline—or states could even revive their ratification efforts if Congress proposed another amendment repealing section 4 of the original.  Passing this amendment avoids the messy politics of full statehood (which requires completely redefining D.C.’s constitutional status) while still addressing the core issue: the 700,000+ residents of D.C. pay taxes, serve in the military, and live under federal laws with zero voting representation in Congress. It’s fundamentally undemocratic.  We’ve had the solution on the table for nearly 50 years. Let’s dust it off and finish the job.",Dry_Role_3260,2025-04-03T09:19:29,2
"They should have 2 or 4, If that were to happen then the electoral college would be odd and unable to be tied.

"As a former resident of DC, they deserve representation. Yes the constitution calls for a federal district, but it could be shrunk to the area around the mall that contains the most important federal buildings and allow the rest of the city to become a state.",ThirstyHank,2025-03-30T10:32:17,3
"DC was formed in response to the Philadelphia Mutiny in 1783, when soldiers who had not be paid for their service attacked the Congress while state and local government failed to intervene.  The representatives had to flee to New Jersey in order to protect themselves.  The idea was that DC would be independent of the states so that it could defend itself without needing the approvals of another authority.  The founders had a point (although they didn't envision that the next attack on the capital would be led by an outgoing president.)   The capital territory should be reduced in size so that it includes only government buildings and no residents who need to be represented.    The rest of what is currently DC should either be spun off into a completely different state or else absorbed by one of its neighbors. As far as I can tell, Maryland has zero interest in participating in the latter.",I405CA,2025-03-30T12:11:32,4

">Therefore, despite DC having more residents than Wyoming and Vermont, it has the same number of presidential electoral votes.  Kind of a moot point for the time being, given that they would have three electoral votes under either system.  Should they have the same voting rights? Sure. They're citizens of this country, they deserve representation in the legislature. Will they get it anytime soon? Probably not. One party isn't going to support it because DC leans heavily towards the other party, and also they'll use the excuse of the Founding Fathers never intending DC to have representation (because they couldn't *possibly* have foreseen DC becoming a major city). The other party is going to drag its heels on it, because the process is just too cumbersome in order for it to be a worthy endeavor. Chances are they'd have to lead some kind of repeal of the 23rd Amendment, which would be really difficult to do in *any* Congress",AntarcticScaleWorm,2025-03-30T02:54:09,5

"This shows how warped the Senate is: a Senator from Wyoming represents 300,000 people, a Senator from California represents over 21,000,000. And Washington DC with almost 10 times as many people as Wyoming has no Senate representation at all.  How can that be fair?  The electoral college is another warped construct. California is about 25% Republicans, and yet those 5 million voters have no electoral college votes for President. As long as states go with winner-take-all for electoral college votes, large numbers of voters know that their vote for President won't count.   In California about 5 million voters know that their vote for President won't count, about the same as the entire state of Oregon.  How can that be fair?",billpalto,2025-03-30T09:12:23,2

No. DC was never intended to be an area with political say in the system. It was to be neutral (how well did that work out?) and no more than 10 sq. mi. where the government conducted its business.

"There are three immediate arguments.  First, creating the area as a new state swings it from ""not enough"" to ""way too much"". It would be one of the smallest states by both area and population. Why add a new state with under a million residents with the same Senate representation as states with 20, 30, 50 million residents? If the alternative is to grossly privilege the voters above many others, lots of people are okay with the idea of ""we might as well be unfair in the current direction rather than unfair in a different direction"".  The second is that we have a precedent on how to solve this problem, in that a good chunk of the area that used to be assigned to DC has become part of Virginia. And, honestly, that solution worked pretty well. If it's super important that the residents of DC become part of a state and get the attendant voting rights, well, there are two states nearby and those states could absorb most of what is currently DC, leaving only a small rump as the actual federal district. This solution is being rejected basically on naked partisan grounds; ""we don't want to affect our local politics"". Well, if the voting issue isn't important enough to override the parochial desires of Maryland politicians, then surely it's not important enough to override the parochial desires of the much larger number of Republican politicians and voters around the nation.  Finally, the addition of new states has -always- been discussed as an issue of partisan politics in the US. The idea that a Republican administration and a Republican Congress is going to assent to add a state whose residents are comprised of the single most Democratic set of voters in the nation is a fantasy anyway...",Avatar_exADV,2025-03-30T10:05:24,2

"You have no reply besides ""ThAts nOT How iT WorKS!” which is neither substantive or constructive. This is why many Americans believe the public school system has failed. Herw is a civics lesson.   The Constitution sets only a maximum size, “not exceeding ten miles square,” for the federal district that is the “Seat of the Government of the United States” (Article 1. Section 8).   Furthermore DC is apolitical because the seat of government, and therefore the people who work for the government, are under the leadership of the executive branch, ie the president, regardless of party.  The founding fathers envisioned states (or, occasionally, commonwealths such as Virginia and Pennsylvania) as places where people would live—have their homes, farm, marry, have children, and so on. They saw Washington, D.C., as a federal district, the seat of government. It wasn’t really seen as a place where people might live . . . or even want to live.  The Founding Fathers were also students of history, and one of the things history tells us is that national governments tend to show favoritism to the Capital City where the government is based. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally, but it’s a common theme across many different nations. Instead of the Seat of Government existing to serve the whole of the nation.

">Part of my concern is that DC is supposed to be a neutral City it was never meant to grow into the city that it is today.   My main argument against this is that when DC was established, local elections were more important than national ones. More people voted in local elections than national ones until the 1820s. DC had local government when it was established. Georgetown and Alexandria elected their own mayors and Washington elected its own city council (and would start electing its own mayor shortly after). It was the massive growth of the city and the Federal government that led them to strip away home rule in the late 19th century.   Even the question of what was intended was muddy. There were many who thought the capital was going to be on the Delaware River, adjacent to Philadelphia. The governor of New York was trying earnestly trying to get it back to New York City. These schemes would have had a shot, but they divided the votes (the southern faction was unified). Ultimately, they decided to move the capital because (1) Pennsylvania was gradually abolishing slavery, and (2) Pennsylvania failed to muster the militia when Revolutionary vets marched on the capital trying to get paid. There was always the idea that Washington would be a grand capital, and the architecture and street designs show that. Even Jefferson, who is probably as small government President as ever elected, helped design the buildings because he aspired to a grand capital.",pgm123,2025-03-30T09:27:22,4

"I wasn't putting words in your mouth, I was asking you to clarify something you left incredibly vague.  So, in response to your 2 examples, I don't think you really understand how Congress works, the actual proposals for DC statehood, or even the exact geographic size we are talking about.  First, plenty of members who buy properties in the DMV buy their properties in Virginia. Virginia hasn't instituted the property tax thing you described, so off the bat, there's no reason to assume DC will. But even if they do, most other lawmakers who do live in the district either A, literally sleep in their office or B, rent. So the property tax wouldn't be an issue for the.. Even if DC does find a way to pass through property taxes on temporary residents, most lawmakers spend most of the year in DC, and can get around the tax that way.   At most, a tax like that would encourage the handful of lawmakers who do buy properties in the District to move to Virginia or Maryland. That's not going to sway any votes.  Your second suggestion IE banning tobacco. Well, unless Maryland and Virginia are on board, that ban is useless. A Virginia gas station is probably no more than 10 minutes away from the House office buildings. Even if the member somehow couldn't drive themselves, they could send an intern.  Even if Virginia and Maryland get on board, the proposals to make DC a state leave the federal property where no one lives as a federal district. Basically, they'd be able to sell cigarettes inside the Capitol and the Congressional Office buildings, if the rules of the building, which the federal government sets, is ok with it. They have the infrastructure already. Theres plenty of shoppettes and coffee shops to sell these things.  Also, like votes don't take so long that jonesing for a cigarette will affect anyone in the Senate. The way votes work in reality, is one is called and Senators have anywhere from like 30 minutes to 1.5 hours to leisurely make their way onto the floor, go thumbs up or down, then walk away. Their participation in even the longest votes amounts to about 30 seconds, unless they are actively lobbying on the floor, where cigarettes are currently banned.  They have a door that allows them to pull up in their car, walk up one small flight of stairs, vote, and turn around. They can go to Virginia, buy cigarettes, pull up to vote, drive back to Virginia, buy more cigarettes, and be back in DC before the vote ends, if they timed it right.",nola_fan,2025-03-31T13:25:57,3

There are no other amendments that are as narrow as the one giving DC electoral college votes. There are plenty of amendments that change what was originally in the Constitution. You can look those up.,Erigion,2025-03-31T09:06:15,2

"All three would agree on representation. Wyoming wasn’t a state when it was given statehood either.   DC wants to be represented as what it is, not as what conservatives want it to be.
