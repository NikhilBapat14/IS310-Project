"It needs to be dumbed down more. Trump doesn't get it. His attention span is too short .    ""Trade deficit means we buy more because we're rich, they sell stuff and donâ€™t buy from us cause they aren't as rich as you! They are buying from you! Not stealing!""",Kameronm,2025-04-18T08:40:37,128
Trade deficits occur because Americans consume more foreign products than we produce for export to those same foreign countries.  Nobody's being ripped off.   We just have an imbecile for a president.,CommieLibrul,2025-04-18T09:02:47,118

I use to wonder if Trump was stupid or evil. Then I decided both. He probably doesn't understand but when people try to explain he doesn't care because he is doing what Putin instructed.,-LunaTink-,2025-04-18T09:25:47,6
So we all know Trump is stupid. But he is not coming up with these ideas himself. He is being fed these ideas from the masters of Project 2025. What are their skewed views on how this shakes out? Do they know they are fucking over the US and donâ€™t care?,warrior033,2025-04-18T09:50:27,5

"What he doesn't mention is that these tariffs are not economic; they are political. Warren Buffett straight up called them ""an act of war."" Which I think is probably the best way to describe it, it is a trade war. The question is, what does ""winning"" a trade war look like, and do we have an exit strategy? That's the problem with this, it is asking the wrong questions.",Rando1ph,2025-04-18T16:40:51,1

"Its just as Jeffrey Sachs says: The U.S. became a military state are some point allowing President Trump to decree emergency executive orders for nonsense reasons. Billionaires intalled this man as dictator via their money and propaganda through their ownership of the media. Billionaires want Trump to give them more money and control. Republicans and ""centrists"", have been acting as pawns for billionaires for decades. Democracy, resource distribution, and checks and balances need to \^immediately\^ be implemented after Trump is defeated, or there will be an even worse ""Trump"" soon after.",w4rma,2025-04-20T15:53:45,1

"I have a trade deficit with my local grocery store. I always buy from them, they never buy from me.  This doesn't mean I am getting cheated by them, it means I am rich enough to afford to buy from them. It means I get my money somewhere else.  We generate our money internally through a strong economy. That affords us the ability to run trade deficits with other countries - to literally be rich enough to go and buy from the world.  This isn't a problem that needs to be fixed. It's a representation of how rich we are.",pagerussell,2025-04-18T10:14:02,42

A better example is a trade deficit with my child care provider.   I make one hundred dollars an hour at my day job. I pay her twenty dollars an hour to watch my kid. She doesn't buy anything from my day job company. I am getting the better deal because I am making more money than she is.Â    Similarly I have a trade deficit with the plumber. I may pay him 200 an hour because he has tools and expertise and it saves me time/money. He still doesn't buy anything from my day job.Â    And yet I need these people.Â ,RemarkableMouse2,2025-04-18T15:52:38,13
