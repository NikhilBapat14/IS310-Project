"What a deeply weird choice for the Google also. There are lots of these cases where two countries call something different names, entirely aside from translations. They show each country their preferred one and just occasionally have to very diplomatically say that no we're not going to change it for everybody because that would be taking sides.   But they've completely bent the knee and renamed it for /everyone/ instead of just for the United States? That's... a choice alright. Presumably is the true basis of their lawsuit also.",shoobe01,2025-05-09T19:53:32,3

"I wiped all my google services out of distrust of the company in how they handle my information, and for behavior like appeasing this administration. They sell you convenience, but they take everything about you, just like Meta, and provide it to some of the worst people and organizations in the world. And on top of that they work tirelessly to erode data protections everywhere while kowtowing to autocrats. Shame on them.",GD_7F,2025-05-09T18:55:19,2

"I don't get it.  Why didn't Google just write the code that if the user is on an American ISP or their IP address is in America, display ""Gulf of America"" and then keep ""Gulf of Mexico"" for everyone else??    There maybe ~330million in the USA lead by an orange twat, but the rest of the world isn't America. If Cheeto in Charge wants Americans to see ""Gulf of America"" so be it. Rest of the world has the right to tell him to fuck off.  Mexico shouldn't only sue Google but insist that unless Mexican IP addresses and ISP's see Gulf of Mexico there'll be further legal actions/restrictions/limitations on Google.  All other nations should effectively join as a class action too.    Same applies to the Persian/Arabian Gulf and any other tech company who want to act like this",KIAA0319,2025-05-10T02:31:38,1

"Do they have a case though? As much as I would love to see Mexico win this case, my understanding is that there are disputes and discrepancies on geographical names all over the globe. This scenario is very common.  Google‚Äôs policy has always been to show the name according to the IP address is making the request. So US IPs get Gulf of America, and the rest of the world gets Gulf of Mexico. How does that translate into a winnable lawsuit for Mexico?",stevem1015,2025-05-09T22:28:49,2
