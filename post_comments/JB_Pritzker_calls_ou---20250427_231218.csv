"I‚Äôm confused by this rhetoric, what exactly does any Dem not currently in elected office expect their elected officials to be doing right now?   Dems lost the last election, they have no majorities in any branch of government despite all the warnings before the election of what was going to happen. The American people spoke and now they have no power. All they can do is what they‚Äôre currently doing, calling out the injustice, corruption, malfeasance, and incompetence of the current administration, vote against any bills they‚Äôre trying to pass, and support protesters wherever and whenever they can.   Sure the vote to keep the government open from Schumer and the other senators wasn‚Äôt great, but he made a good point as to why he voted the way he did. So yeah, this is democracy, Americans voted for the fascists, and now fascism is sweeping the nation, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs helpful to decry their lack of action when they‚Äôre not empowered by the voters to act.   If I were an elected representative, I‚Äôd be doing exactly what the Dems are doing now, the American people voted for this, so we need to let it happen, just document the chaos as best you can and hope that democracy survives long enough for it to be salvageable. For low information and disengaged voters the only way they can see why the GOP is a bad bet is they need to feel the pain of their policies.

And importantly I do think that having a billionaire stand up to Trump is super important.

Having wealthy people on your side mean they have the funds to carry on even if their fundraising is cut because of actions of the regime, and it shows ordinary people that those in power could choose to be better but instead they're choosing to inflict pain.

Some of them are up for election next year, some, like Jon Ossoff are in for a fight. The majority of these Senators have voted for no for all of these selections.

It is a meme to hate on Joe Manchin, but if he had been in the Senate instead of Jim Justice, Pete Hegseth is probably defeated.
