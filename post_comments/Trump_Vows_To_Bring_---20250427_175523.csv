I’m glad Columbus “found” the Americas but I can agree he was a major douche that no longer needs to be celebrated,CCCmonster,2025-04-27T18:28:14,909
"Columbus just stumbled onto the Americas, certainly not the first to set foot. Not holiday worthy.",miscstarsong,2025-04-27T20:15:20,306
Seems kind of dumb to me. Focus on things that matter.,wildbackdunesman,2025-04-28T06:23:44,41
Woo-hoo. I can hardly contain myself...  ...But Mr. President. Hasn't Columbus Day ALWAYS been a US federal holiday (since...1940's)!!??,Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-28T09:31:52,14

This has become another sub to farm karma for the left. You really can't blame conservatives for leaving we have been banned from about every sub and every sub is just left wing propaganda and that is far from enjoyable.,Hectoriu,2025-04-27T22:20:40,0

"This is the important thing. You don't get right-wing legislation passed if you have a demoralized country that hates America, hates its history, and hates the people that founded it.  Leftists understand this quite well, which is why they focus so hard on renamings and changing language.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-27T18:50:06,-325
You can still bring this back while prioritizing other things. Stop with the fake outrage.,Trondkjo,2025-04-27T19:30:49,-180
I feel like this comment is getting upvoted by a lot of liberals.,Res_Novae17,2025-04-28T05:48:20,-54
"More importantly, Columbus Day is a ridiculous holiday.  Like, what are you supposed to do in mid-October to celebrate?  Go outside and rake leaves?  I'd rather have a holiday on November 1 so that we all have a day to recover from Halloween.  Same goes for MLK Day.",ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-27T21:59:25,145
"You realize the primary source for Columbus being a ""douche"" was written by his main political rival? Outside of that, there's not really any documentation that suggest he was some kind of villain. This is a lie perpetrated by the left especially in academia to try and discredit western greatness.",The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-28T13:15:39,1
![gif](giphy|I2m7l4yZqRdgk)  He discovered America is what he did. He was a brave Italian explorer and in this house Christopher Columbus is a hero. End of story!,Big_Iron_Cowboy,2025-04-27T18:32:18,-112
He was a perfectly fine human being for the 15th century. We'll all be monsters in the future for reasons we don't even understand today.,Res_Novae17,2025-04-28T05:49:09,-8
"So you've never even looked into the opposition research against the Marxist ""historians"" who want to use Columbus as a sign that the entire history of European presence was always evil.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-27T18:33:46,-134
That’s mostly propaganda meant to delegitimize the Spanish claim to the New World.,Taetrum_Peccator,2025-04-27T18:53:38,-65
"This isn't a hill I'll die on by any means but he is the guy who ""discovered"" America in the sense that after he got here, it set off the immigration that eventually led to the US being created. It's significant in that its the oldest event in American history that might be worthy of a holiday. A few hundred dudes decided to sail thousands of miles into the ocean to maybe find land on the other side, which is sort of cool. If the controversy is around the guy himself, I'd be perfectly fine with it being renamed ""Mayflower Day"" or something of the sorts. If it's with the Spanish pillaging the Native Americans.. yeah can't help with that.   Indigenous peoples day doesn't offend me but they could at least come up with something that rolls off the tongue better.",Smacpats111111,2025-04-28T00:14:54,22

> I didn’t realize it had died.  Seriously. Not only would this normally be considered a waste of time to focus on... but Columbus Day has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year for the past century.   It was celebrated last year. The year before... and so on and so on.  What exactly is Trump claiming to do here? Reinstating a holiday that never went away?,Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-28T09:34:30,24
Yes but honestly who cares about this? The only people that It matters to is federal and bank workers who get a day off.,ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-04-28T19:34:07,1

No. Trump should be riding them like rented mules until they get off their asses and do something.,dottedoctet,2025-04-27T20:28:38,141
Quit being dramatic. There is no “outrage” other than congress not doing shit.   I couldn’t give AF less about Columbus right now.,dottedoctet,2025-04-27T21:43:33,183

"Sheesh, popping in here after being mostly on X for a while, this ""conservative"" sub is full of leftists and neocons. Guess you can take the redditor out of the Marxist subs, but you can't take the Marxism out of the redditor.   This is more important that many realize for the reason you state, it starts to rug pull one of the foundations of Marxist philosophy in this country. We're in an information war and stuff like this that kills some of the sacred cows of the other side is part of it.",tigermaple,2025-04-27T18:55:42,-67

"I hadn’t thought of it like that, good point.  And agree about Indigenous Peoples Day.",miscstarsong,2025-04-28T02:55:40,5
I’m guessing it’s because the left has bitched about it and claim it to be Indigenous Peoples Day. But seriously Trump needs to focus on important matters like you said. Not this stupid stuff.,JunkMale975,2025-04-28T11:08:24,3

"He was imprisoned by the Queen of Spain upon returning from his first voyage. His crime? He was too brutal... to his Spaniard crew. He was cutting off the noses of Spaniards who had taken indigenous children as sex slaves, and the Queen thought it was unchristian of him to humanize the natives.  Yes, he lived in a time of conquest. But he was absolutely an average or above average human for the time.",Res_Novae17,2025-04-28T09:34:24,4
