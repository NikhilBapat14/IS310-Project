From the charges they view her as a primary actor, which may explain why they aren‚Äôt going after Ruiz‚Äôs attorney with elements of 28 USC regarding duties of an officer of the court.   We‚Äôll see how this plays out.   Complaint specifics:  ‚ÄúDugan was arrested and charged with obstruction of an official proceeding after evidence came to light that she had shielded Flores-Ruiz from ICE agents, according to a criminal complaint. She was also charged with concealing an individual to prevent discovery and arrest.  Dugan demanded that the officers proceed to the chief judge‚Äôs office and ‚Äì after his hearing ended ‚Äì escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a restricted jury door, bypassing the public area where agents were waiting to arrest him, per the complaint.‚Äù",BenTallmadge1775,2025-04-26T06:05:57,1

It's a completely unrelated document to a judicial warrant.  For a warrant for arrest, you still need to present evidence to a judge and get a judicial warrant, and as the recent 9-0 supreme court case determined, ICE absolutely do have to adhere to due process.  The judge actually directed them to the chief of court to see about getting a proper warrant for the arrest.

"An administrative warrant is a completely unrelated document. It doesn't empower them to make arrests. It's basically a memo from their agency saying they have the powers of their agency.  Anything they would need a real warrant for, they still have to go before a judge, present evidence, and get an actual judicial warrant.  Keep in mind that ICE can only claim to have these powers because Trump declared a national emergency that he claims gives him the ability to expand the powers of border control from people within a certain distance of the border to effectively unchecked power to detain anyone, anywhere in the US, and congress has sustained that two week emergency declaration for months now via a procedural vote to stop counting calendar days so that the order, which is required by law to be renewed by congressional vote, can never come to that vote and never expire.  This is the same procedural ratfucking that they did to give Trump complete control over tariffs under ""emergency powers,"" despite tariffs being explicitly a congressional power, not an executive one, and such emergency declarations *requiring* a vote before congress after a certain period of time.  SCOTUS has already rebuked this idea that ICE is exempt from due process in a 9-0 ruling, and yet they are continuing to operate this way, and just today Trump directed ICE that they can enter any home without a warrant.  All of this is illegal on its face, but it is going to take a long time for it to get through the courts, and now clearly they are attempting to intimidate the courts as well.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T16:35:31,2

"I love this systems-think...Very interesting to observe. The laws of systems are simple...They start simple (nothing that starts complicated survives) and grow through positive reinforcement. The only goal of a system (unions, politics, countries, corporations) is to grow (not do what it says it's doing -- MTV being a fine example). But when they grow they bump and smash into other systems, and in order to keep their own growth unchecked they have to shrink the combative system. And they accomplish this by flowing in positive reinforcement for their systems-people (us reddit schmucks) and dumping negative reinforcement at the enemy system.   But at a certain point things within the system stop working right and the actual role of the system isn't at all what the system says it's doing (canceling Bernie from an election for Democracy)...But the people who've gotten sucked into the growth cycle of the system can't see this because systems only filter down positive reinforcement to their systems-people (to grow). And out of all the systems created by humans politics are the worst. Maoism , specifically,  is Systematics in its rawest form and its something you can observe real-time in Reddit space. So a Judge, responsible for maintaining order and presiding over the law, is seen shepherding a violent defendant into an actual jury-room -- which is supposed to be used only by jurrors to decide on his guilt -- from the LEO that's responsible for bringing cases before judges.

The media giving Trump basically billions in free press and happily sucking on the Hillary scandal this and that while constantly downplaying Trump's own scandals and Trump still only barely beat her.  Donald Trump has **never** been anywhere near as popular as his side would have people believe. Even among his own side he isn't really that popular. He has support because these people are extremely dedicated to their identity as Republicans and easily fed into cult-like behavior. Snap them out of that and the Republicans are done and they know it, which is why they have gone all in on dictatorship because they know their time is running out. Their lies to their base have become increasingly unhinged... their chosen messiah is himself increasingly unhinged.  People on their side ARE waking up to the insanity of it all and these are the same people who were willing to storm the capitol over a lie... what I wonder will they do when it dawns on them that their side has been consistently lying to them for decades now?",ManiaGamine,2025-04-25T19:56:37,3
">So what's the solution then?  There isn't one. Not one that that I can mention here anyway. >What do we do to discourage this from them?  These people have removed the concept of shame from their side. Donald Trump v1 basically eliminated the one possible recourse that could be levied against them which was shaming them to the point where they might think twice, that is no longer the case. They revel in their shamelessness and because of that fact the one power the people had to maybe discourage them is now gone. The only other power available would be to vote them out but that's the issue with the mechanisms they're using... they can basically wholesale remove the groups of voters that could potentially vote them out.  Texas was considering (I don't know where it's up to now) setting up a state-wide electoral college system so that they could not be voted out by the populous cities outnumbering the rural counties. It's this kind of ""legal fuckery"" that these people have the power to employ and in so doing can basically make it all but impossible to vote them out. >If we can't, then what's the fucking point in even calling it out if we're fucked either way?  The point of calling it out is to bring attention to it in the hopes that enough people see it to eventually rise up to stop it. By your logic an abused person should not mention the abuse or the abuser because ""there's no point"" when we know in a situation of abuse even if your cries might not work today... that doesn't mean they won't work tomorrow or the day after. Resignation is exactly what these people want. They want everyone to just resign and accept their rule. ""The revolution can be bloodless if the left allows it to be"" they literally sell this as a revolution... and in a way it is. They are throwing off the shackles of the American democratic republic specifically to install a hyperconservative theocracy. >We can't even suggest it come to violence because 1) that'd be playing right into the lies the current regime tells about anyone who isn't enthusiastically backing them, and 2) because resorting to attacking our countrymen over differences of opinion is batshit insane and just plain wrong and would well and truly spell the end of this nation, and herald the deaths of potentially thousands to millions in a pointless second civil war, like the fearmongers on the right kept alluding to in their podcasts and through their talking head propagandists during Biden's presidency, on a level that even Bush's administration would call ridiculous. PLEASE, tell me what the fuck we are meant to even do?  The notion that you can't suggest violence is exactly where they want you. Helpless. But here's the thing... these people, the ones behind this shit are mostly cowards but the ones who **supported** them are not. They've already shown a willingness to storm the fucking capitol over a lie... what do you think they're willing to do when they finally realize the truth that they've been screwed? When we see supposed conservative Americans praising the would-be dictatorship Trump is trying to create and praising the sycophants online for supporting it... consider this. These are not the norm, these people exist specifically to make the rest think that they all accept this shit but they don't. The actual Trump supporters that got us here are pissed off and these are the people who absolutely will be brought to violence so the ""solution"" if there is one is to help them get to that point. Not necessarily to the point of violence specifically, but to the same point that they got to the last time. But this time with the understanding that they have been lied to by their own side for decades. >PLEASE, tell me what the fuck we are meant to even do?  As I said help get conservatives to understand the lies they've been fed, and it is possible. Once enough of their side is fed up with this shit then and only then can these issues start to be addressed because the Democrats cannot win electorally with the ratfuckery the GOP has set up that's really what the last few cycles has demonstrated. That their *legal* ratfuckery has made it increasingly difficult for Democrats to win even if and when they are actually popular enough to do so. When the Democrat has to basically win by an increasingly unrealistic margin each and every cycle to beat the electoral college advantage... the system is broken and that isn't even counting the *legal* cheating the GOP has done beyond that.  So yeah... just help people across the entire divide realize what has happened and most importantly make people realize that dissolving American Democracy is quite literally the opposite of America. You can't call yourself a patriot and want a dictator. They are mutually exclusive and I think most of them know that. Even the ones who have openly declared that they do want a dictator... they only think that because they've been convinced that the Democrats have already somehow thrown America out the window but that's the lie they were told to get them to become pro-dictator in the first place. So basically... help people realize they've been lied to is the solution and the rest will likely come naturally as a result of that. Because the American people especially on the right-wing do not like to be lied to... but one of the most perverse lies the right has been told IS that the left is lying to them.",ManiaGamine,2025-04-25T20:00:56,1

Yes he pardoned various Jan. 6 people, not all got full pardons. It's not being pedantic - pedantic doesn't even fit here - it's literally our standing law interpretation at the moment. He was being investigated, for years, and then prosecuted. Since a sitting president cannot be prosecuted his cases were thrown out.  I'm sorry - he didn't *pardon* himself. The cases were just 'thrown out' and amounted to nothing in the grand scheme of things - or at least seem to have amounted to nothing. I'm not spreading misinformation by the way, I'm just kind of forgetting some details amongst all of the absolutely batshit things that would have sunk anyone else.  >Canada isn't a small African or South American country a war with you all would be disastrous.  We're a country with 1/10th the population and no nukes, no strategic bombers, and an airforce and standing army almost matched by the US Coast Guard alone.

"Thank you for the well thought out response‚Ä¶ honestly I know in my heart the only hope is to reach out and try to show the other side that they are the ones being fleeced, but I still have a hard time rebutting them when they parrot the same old talking points their media and Trump feeds them. I admit I need to do a lot more research and have answers and evidence to back said answers up at the ready. The way is to stop playing to the script they‚Äôre using and to insist on treating the people who voted for Trump as just that, _people_ who were manipulated and lied to. You made an excellent point about the violence thing I was admittedly very afraid about. If they learn the extent to which their nation and every freedom they tout loving is in jeopardy, and how many lies they have been fed, they will _not_ take it lying down. They‚Äôll be the first ones standing up and resisting, because even the uneducated among them have belief. The conservative voters have passion and genuine pride in their values and country.
