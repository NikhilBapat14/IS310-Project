He was just babbling nonsense during a particularly bad dementia episode.,sirhackenslash,2025-05-09T11:43:59,5
"He'll say anything he thinks the people want to hear with no intention of doing it.   Just like he said he'd end the war in Ukraine on day 1.  Just like he said we'd be 3 days away from the greatest economy and stark market if he's elected.  Just like the 15,000+ other confirmed lies he's said.",No_Size9475,2025-05-09T11:53:00,2
Here’s a thought. How about not giving a ridiculous tax break to the very wealthy in the first place.,Feisty-Name8864,2025-05-09T12:18:53,2
I’d be ok with that.,Night-Gardener,2025-05-09T11:41:39,2

Raising taxes on the rich to pay for tax cuts for the rich.  the man is insane.,crosstheroom,2025-05-09T11:49:20,1
Gonna raise taxes on the rich just so he can cut taxes for the rich and claim a huge Trump Republican victory for policy.,memcginn,2025-05-09T11:52:31,1
"If it’s true, which it isn’t then it’s because they’ve expressed anger towards him.",PlasticTaster,2025-05-09T12:02:10,1
"I’m confused, his tax cut relies on a tax increase?",Choice_Cup_3624,2025-05-09T13:04:21,1
Another bout of useless verbal diarrhea,hive999,2025-05-09T14:15:11,1
Raising taxes is inevitable unless we radically decrease spending which would kill the GOP and they would deserve. The politically savvy thing to do here for Trump is steal Democrat thunder and actually raise taxes on the rich.,jankdangus,2025-05-09T15:40:29,1
"Even better, DON'T pass the tax cuts.  Tax the rich twice!",AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-09T19:56:20,1
"Oh, are we suddenly going to start believing his lies?",Dream-Ambassador,2025-05-09T11:48:44,0
"No see he would only suggest this if there was an easy loophole that they could all practically automatically use, so he gets credit for implementing the tax but the effect is nothing or a tax break for the rich. Politically best of both worlds.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-09T12:11:37,5
He needs the rich to pay just a little bit to make up for his 125% tax cuts for his family and elmo,sirhackenslash,2025-05-09T11:45:04,3
the goal is to get rid of tax returns in favor of tariffs,orangejuicecake,2025-05-09T22:30:14,1

"It has to go through Congress, which has a slim GOP majority.  So it won't get to Trump's desk.",skippingstone,2025-05-09T12:14:05,1
would you support it if he did?,FistOfTheHeavens,2025-05-09T11:49:33,-1

Tax increase on top earners to pay for tax cuts on the middle class.,jankdangus,2025-05-09T15:41:27,1
Would need to see the actual policy if it was going after the loan floating insanity that is used to dodge taxes absolutely,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-09T12:02:27,3
It depends on the actual details. Generally Trump uses words to cover actual action.,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T11:52:07,4
"I would support that move.  It should have come years ago in place of tax cuts for them instead, especially when the richest Americans already evade billions of dollars in taxes a year as it is.",MysticKoolaid808,2025-05-09T11:57:37,1
"Yes, reporting every stupid thing he says that isn't going to happen takes attention away from all the terrible stuff he's in the middle of doing.",hey-coffee-eyes,2025-05-09T11:56:11,6
"They’re falling for his usual BS, which is obvious to anyone of discernment:  Trump pivots, says GOP should ‘probably not’ raise taxes on rich  https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5291877-trump-tax-increase-rich/",transcriptoin_error,2025-05-09T12:17:03,5

Clearly you've never met someone with dementia.,First_Shes_Sweet,2025-05-09T11:51:23,4
"No. Answer my question. What are they falling for? This headline is “he suggested this.” It doesn’t say that he’ll do it,  just that he suggested it.",ElderSmackJack,2025-05-09T11:53:15,-3
"They're taking a statement in which he said ""In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!"" and framing it as Trump wanting to raise taxes on the rich.  Also ignoring the obvious reality that Republicans in Congress aren't going to raise taxes on rich people. So Trump gets a nice headline for no good reason. The media is complicit in what some people call ""sanewashing"" the inane ramblings of this incompetent dipshit.",FunkyChedda,2025-05-09T11:56:29,5
That’s absolute nonsense. The headline means he suggested it. That’s exactly what he did. That isn’t “sanewashing.” It’s telling the truth.   But keep being cynical.,ElderSmackJack,2025-05-09T11:59:11,-7
