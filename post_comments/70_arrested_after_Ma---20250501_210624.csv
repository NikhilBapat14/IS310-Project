"Arrested for blocking a street while protesting against treason, fascism, and the destruction of the United States of America.",Still_Mix3277,2025-05-01T21:10:20,88
">""While the demonstration was intended to be peaceful, it led to the blockage of a major roadway, causing significant traffic disruptions and creating safety concerns for both protestors and motorists,""  I'm going to go with still peaceful.  Protestors knew they were going to be arrested and did so peacefully. Solidarity with Bernie having been arrested for the same statement when he was young.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T21:12:25,117

"That phrasing is so suspect. Blocking the street is still peaceful, even if it's breaking the law. That phrase ""intended to be"" betrays a bias in the person who wrote it.",enjoycarrots,2025-05-01T21:15:10,70
"I was there. Protesters were peaceful and knew full well that they were going to be arrested after multiple warnings by police. There were A TON of police, and two buses to haul away protesters to a local police station in Philly. There was no resisting arrest and the crowd around the protesters were fully supportive and vigilant. There was an initial bike line of police officers which maintained the perimeter, then about 30-40 police in more equipped gear came and made the arrests. I did find it interesting that some of the arresting officers were wearing clothing that obstructed their face/identity.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-01T22:13:48,30

"Nah, they like Sanders exactly where he is. They want to keep his supporters focused on Democrats, not angry at Republicans.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-01T21:36:22,-27
"The intended statement is ""The protest was intended to be civilly obedient; instead protestors were civilly disobedient.""  It's the word play of:  Peace is the absence of X (violence)   Peace is the presence of Y (order)   Pick one as needed",nerphurp,2025-05-01T21:32:59,23
So says the Democrat who came into the thread just to take a shot at and exacerbate divisions with Sanders supporters.,Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-05-01T21:45:45,14
Was gonna say this lol. I don’t know why these people think others can’t chew gum & walk at the same time.,Jamira360,2025-05-01T22:16:43,10
"I mean... Is this not a thread about Sanders? Hell of a lot better than threads about random GOP shit and people bringing Sanders up.  I responded to the comment above and you absolutely made my point for me. Thank you for that.  FWIW, I donated to Sanders in 2016 and 2020. But I didn't buy a membership to a cult.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-01T22:22:17,-13
It’s funny just how easy it is to see the folks who are actively fucking things up and their supporters when your identity isn’t tied to a political party.,runsailswimsurf,2025-05-01T22:24:35,3
"Grandpa No steps up to the platform, his routine calling for trying to deflect from the self report of calling out Sanders supporters for attacking Democrats by attacking Democrats himself.  Oof, that was... not great, even by Reddit standards.  Mostly threes across the board, with the exception of the Russian judge awarding an 8/10.",Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-05-01T22:27:36,8
"Now you assume I'm part of a party instead of an unaffiliated voter tired of watching people fall into personality cults.  A moment of awareness on your part might have been noting that bad actors _also_ want people to continue to be frustrated with Sanders, too, and therefore not every ""Bernie Bro"" is real. But, you didn't do that. You instead incorrectly attacked someone for being a party member.  Anyway. Y'all enjoy.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-01T22:41:48,-16
