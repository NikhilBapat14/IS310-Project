"I guess he thinks SCOTUS will be afraid of him now, because he's arresting judges on frivolous charges?  He's so stupid.  Felon. Diaper-wearing Dope.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-25T15:29:55,18

"What is the rationale other than hatred, bigotry, intolerance and does SCOTUS see this for what it is?  How is a transgender person less qualified to serve their country?  And why would you deny them that right?  Oh, right...the christofascists want to kill all the undesirables.  We know that.  Does SCOTUS know that?",mhouse2001,2025-04-25T18:01:16,3

I think 2 of these jurist believe they're immune to his Stalinist fits.  No other judges - in the world - misunderstand what it means when a Cop throws a Judge in prison.,XSinTrick6666,2025-04-25T15:42:44,3
they’re about to get the wake up of their lifetime they created this monster maybe the leopard will eat their faces next.,Akraxs,2025-04-25T18:20:48,3
"Oh the Leopard will not be missing any meals for a few years...   Remember the guy who first endorsed Trump?  That's Ok.  Nobody does.  Sen. Jeff Sessions.  Got his face chewed off and tiny body mangled years ago.  He's uber-dead, politically.  Trump replaced him w a zombie who thinks the 3 branches of US govt are “the House, the Senate and executive”.  During Trump years, the Leopard wants for NOTHING, except a place to vomit.  As Seneca said  ""They vomit so they may eat, and eat so that they may vomit.""",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-25T19:15:11,3
