"Since World War II, American science has benefited from the following:  - Political stability - Federal funding from the likes of the NSF and the NIH, much more than other developed country, although much less than 1% of the federal budget. - Influx of talented scientists from other countries who fled their home countries for fear of political persecution, anti-intellectual crackdowns, or just to pursue more fertile grounds. Think Jewish physicists in the 1930s, German engineers after the 1940s, or Chinese scientists after their Civil War and the Cultural Revolution. It's a big reason we have had by far the best institutes of higher education despite being completely mediocre at K-12 education.  All of a sudden, all three of these are in peril.  Imagine if you were a basketball player, and all you wanted to do was play basketball at the highest level. Over essentially this same time (the precursor to the NBA was founded in 1946), the best place to do this would have been in the United States, regardless of your country of origin.  Now imagine that abruptly the NBA were disbanded due to executive order. And consider the following:  - Obviously, scientists are compensated much less than NBA players, meaning they do not have the ""luxury"" of waiting out for a more stable environment. - Whereas NBA players can go professional straight out of high school or after a few years of college, scientists need an additional 15-20 years after college to be able to secure their first funding sources. This is for the minuscule proportion competitive enough to apply for this diminish share of the pie. - There is sometimes healthy debate within the normal scientific and communities around emerging topics, and then there are wholescale attacks on topics for which there is consensus, like COVID, vaccines, climate change. - The most celebrated scientists and physicians such as Anthony Fauci have been subject to maligned and subjected to stochastic terrorism, and his eventual successor Jeanne Marrazzo was put on leave and threatened with relegation to a rural site. If the United States had a Siberia, I'm sure they would have loved to send her there. Instead, they've been replaced by stooges with absolutely no qualification for their positions.  For an immigrant from another country, or even for a native US scientist whose known no other country, how do you justify staying? We're this close to being tried for heresy like Galileo or falling into 21st century Lysenkoism.",Prudent-Corgi3793,2025-04-29T09:15:47,3

"So the Orange miscreant conducts his war against the smart and educated, completely oblivious to the fact that science and technology have been the most important drivers of US economic and medical progress since the Manhattan Project. As the production of goods has waned in the US, the knowledge economy has been the country's last legitimate claim of ""exceptionalism."" He has a demented drive to destroy that, ostensibly in order to return the country to the mythical ""American Greatness"" of the early 1900s.  I suppose that America's loss of its brain trust will end up being the silver lining of Trump's stupidity - for the rest of the world.",phosdick,2025-04-29T07:04:45,1
"No shit. Anyone who can do math in their head will be wearing a Yellow Star of Woke soon.  Science spending was bipartisan for decades because both sides knew that spending generated innovation which drove US industry. The biggest recent threat was China and Trump just planted the US behind them by cutting off all IP development pipelines to industry and pharmaceuticals.   The problem however, is that no other country comes close to the US for funding, so just leaving isn't really an option. US spent $37B at NIH, Canada spends $0.7B, similar amount to UK. The world did rely far too much on US NIH spending.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-04-29T12:40:34,1
They will lose ability to manufacture by causing the people who drive industry to move away from the country you are trying to build self reliant economy my that’s some 4D chess game,Puncho666,2025-04-29T14:42:57,1
