"I mean Ford was already an unelected President who had pardoned Nixon; Carter was ahead by 33 points in the polls after his nomination, so it's not really unreasonable to think the Helsinki Accords did not play a big role---so I guess you have to answer the question, ""DID the Helsinki Accords tank Ford's campaign"" first before asking why second.",digbyforever,2022-12-30T11:01:02,8
This is a question better suited for ask historians.,[deleted],2022-12-29T23:49:29,5
I think the Helsinki Accords had zero percent to do with Ford's unsuccessful campaign and his membership in the Republican Party so soon after Watergate (and his recent pardoning of Nixon especially) had almost 100% to do with it.,mormagils,2023-01-03T09:00:39,3
This exactly. He was doomed the moment he pardoned Nixon,GoldenInfrared,2022-12-30T14:24:48,3
