A downswing in the economy means it's cheaper for people to travel to your country.

Also, student loan debt is one of the only types of debt not subject to bankruptcy laws.  The other Executive Orders: remove a certain population (trans people) from existence and make every human sexless, kidnap and attempt to deport legal immigrants who say the wrong thing, kidnap and send people with scary skin tones and tattoos to foreign concentration camps, and enact broad tariffs on literally every country (even uninhabited ones), based on nonsensical math and nonexistent economic theory, just to name a few.  Both were deemed unconstitutional. One was engineered to help Americans while incidentally cutting into the profits of billionaires, the others are designed to harm Americans and anyone living here, while consolidating power into the executive and a handful of oligarchs.",Raptorex27,2025-04-24T10:00:40,12
"Also, those with high debt loads most likely had paid back their original amount from interest paid over the past 15 or so years with little principal reduction. I believe some of that is what Biden was trying rectify.  There is profiting on a loan and usury. Some of the students loans the public has are more along the lines of usury when it comes to those that need years of schooling for medical or highly other specialized professional degrees.",NeumanA,2025-04-24T10:02:48,3

"Technically this was his 3rd time running which is why it’s absolutely insane for people to have voted for him. 1st time: ok whatever, maybe the country was swinging back to GOP after 8 years of Obama and Hillary was unpopular, people wanted a change, etc. whatever. 2nd time: this was after experiencing 4 years of bullshit and literally fucking up covid so this time would still be stupid as fuck but because Jan 6 hadn’t happened yet, I am SORT of forgiving this one. 3rd time: voted for this fuck weasel AFTER Jan 6 coup attempt, AFTER knowing how bad his first term was, after the “eating the pets” debate where he driveled on for 2 hours about nonsense.

I did specify that the voters may not and even still may not have known what they were voting for. Most people are very quotiedien so don't follow news or what the Trump administration was proposing or even is doing. That being said Michigan did vote for these policies likely again not fully intentionally but a significant portion of Michigan voted for America first rhetoric that is what is occurring now and the relationship with Canada is an inevitable and somewhat expected casualty. I am not disagreeing with the point that Michiganders like Canada and the special relationship just that they (or at least a plurality of the voting population) actively supported a candidate who was fairly hostile to existing US alliances. I do caveat this with the view that most people and voters are relatively ignorant of proposed policies and issues.,cjh42,2025-04-24T07:53:38,1
