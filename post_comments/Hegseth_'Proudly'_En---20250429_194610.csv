"To be honest the Military doesn’t know how to handle rape cases anyway.  When I served, my battalions regularly received briefings from CID (criminal investigation division) and they said.    “If you have sex with someone who’s had ANY amount of alcohol, it’s rape“.  So the question was asked. What if both people had just 1  drink? And they said that both people were raped. So in their eyes. You can rape someone while being raped.  And whoever gets to the Military Police and reports first was the true victim. The joke became telling someone to „stop raping me while I’m raping you.“",jenk1980,2025-04-30T01:14:32,1
