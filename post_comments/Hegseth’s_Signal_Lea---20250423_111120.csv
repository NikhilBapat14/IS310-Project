"This info is irrelevant. Even if she does have one, it's against the law to discuss classified info in an uncleared environment.",bdhw,2025-04-23T11:18:10,31
"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s wife, who was involved in her husband’s latest Signal leak scandal, submitted paperwork for a security clearance—but it was unclear if it was granted, according to a CNN report.  A Pentagon spokesperson told CNN that the Pentagon doesn’t comment on security clearances for any individual, declining to confirm or deny whether Jennifer Rauchet has been granted one.  The revelation comes days after The New York Times reported that Hegseth had discussed sensitive military attack plans in a group chat including his wife, his brother, and even his personal lawyer.   [**Read the full story here**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hegseths-signal-leak-scandal-jennifer-wife-tried-to-get-security-clearance/).",thedailybeast,2025-04-23T11:11:44,5

Is this the wife that’s a Fox News producer?,honeybee2288,2025-04-23T12:33:42,1
They’re coming across as MacBethian. He trusts no one and she doesn’t trust his daydrinking. They’re seeking something higher.,RFP4L,2025-04-23T22:48:36,1
For such a tough alpha male his wife sure has his balls in her purse in a very public way.,ennuiinmotion,2025-04-24T06:41:40,1
"Even if the environment was approved, you still must satisfy the “need to know” part of accessing classified information. Why would she need to know what operations our military is conducting?",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-23T11:43:33,14
It's relevant because she doesn't need a fucking clearance. I don't discuss my clients' sensitive issues with my husband; he doesn't tell me the deep inner workings of his company.   The fact that his wife -- a Fox News producer -- feels she should have access to classified intel is more than a little troubling.,BurnedWitch88,2025-04-23T12:13:44,7
Also I can’t imagine she has any need to know anything.,Area51_Spurs,2025-04-23T12:10:44,4
"Worse, even if it wasn’t classified, it can still be sensitive info that falls into the ‘need to know’ category.   There is zero reason for those details to have been disclosed to her. Absolutely none. It’s right up there with giving a reporter access to similar info. I bet in the coming weeks there will be at least one more person discovered who he shared sensitive ‘need to know’ info with, classified or not, who had no reason to be informed.   At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was something he had made a bit of a habit out of it. By the time the news broke on the first signal gate story, he very well may have done this with dozens of people that we have simply yet to find out about.",nikolai_470000,2025-04-23T14:05:02,3

"Honestly, that may be part of it. Dude is a (semi) functional alcoholic. I would not be shocked if she has to manage a lot of stuff for him and just assumed she'd have to keep up on work messages too.",BurnedWitch88,2025-04-23T13:01:16,2
