"As per [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cory-mills-florida-bronze-star-iraq-b2745118.html) üì∞:  - Representative Cory Mills earned his Bronze Star for reportedly saving his fellow soldiers in Iraq, but those present say they don‚Äôt remember the lawmaker being there.   Representative Cory Mills, a MAGA Republican from Florida, was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroism in Iraq in 2003 ‚Äî but those he allegedly saved don‚Äôt remember him being there, a new report reveals.  Mills was honored after he administered ‚Äúlife-saving care‚Äù to fellow soldiers Joe Heit and Alan Babin at ‚Äúgreat risk to his own life‚Äù while under ‚Äúintense enemy fire‚Äù in Iraq, NOTUS reports, citing the document recommending Mills receive the award. Mills enlisted in the Army in July 1999 at 19 years old and was honorably discharged in August 2003.  But Heit told NOTUS that Mills ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt save‚Äù his life, and that he didn‚Äôt even suffer life-threatening injuries.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall him being there either,‚Äù he added.  Henry Barbe, a medic who flew in via helicopter to help evacuate Babin, also told NOTUS he doesn‚Äôt remember Mills being there.  ‚ÄúFrom what I understand about Mills is he might have been in the unit. I don‚Äôt remember him being involved in the medevac,‚Äù Barbe said. ‚ÄúTo be fair, I was worried about the patients. I don‚Äôt remember him, and from what I understand, other people don‚Äôt remember him.‚Äù  Chris Painter, the platoon sergeant, said he can ‚Äúpretty much confirm 100% Cory Mills was not up at the bridges at the location of everything.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNow, if he came to the company position to assist in escorting Babin to the BN aid station, I don‚Äôt know...but he wasn‚Äôt at the bridge [where] it all happened I do know that,‚Äù Painter told NOTUS.  Army documents recommending Mills for the award also state he saved Joe Ferrand, a sergeant who had been ‚Äúgrabbed by an enemy insurgent‚Äù in a separate incident, according to NOTUS. But Ferrand previously claimed Mills‚Äô involvement in the incident was a ‚Äúfabrication‚Äù and said that the act ‚Äúnever took place,‚Äù in a written statement to government officials.  In response to these claims, Mills told NOTUS that ‚Äúno soldier writes their own DA Form 638,‚Äù referring to the document used to recommend soldiers for awards.  ‚ÄúIt is a recommendation for award and soldiers cannot recommend themselves,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúThe form must be reviewed and signed by commanding officers.‚Äù  Mills also conceded that it was ‚Äútrue‚Äù that Heit ‚Äúdid not have life-threatening injuries‚Äù and attributed the discrepancies to how chaotic the day was.  ‚ÄúI was on the ground,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúIt was a chaotic day and understandable that others may have different recollections of events.‚Äù  The questions around his Bronze Star have been relayed to the Office of Congressional Ethics, Department of Justice, a U.S. attorney‚Äôs office in Florida and the FBI, the source told NOTUS.  This isn‚Äôt the first time Mills‚Äôs military accomplishments have been questioned.  Last year, Mills‚Äôs Republican challenger Michael Johnson handed out flyers accusing him of lying about his military service and committing stolen valor, The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Mills denied the claims at the time.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of the slander and the defamation,‚Äù Mills told the News-Journal. ‚ÄúI ran for office to be able to serve the American people, not to defend something I did 20 years ago over and over and over.‚Äù  Mills was elected to Congress in 2022 and has since proven a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Mills even attended his hush money trial last summer alongside fellow lawmakers including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Representative Byron Donalds.  The Republican lawmaker also made headlines February after his romantic partner Sarah Raviani filed a police report claiming she had been assaulted by Mills at his Washington, D.C. apartment.  ‚Äú(Her significant other for over a year) grabbed her, shoved her, and pushed her out of the door,‚Äù the police report obtained by NBC Washington states.  Raviani, a cofounder of the group Iranians for Trump, then allowed police to listen in on a phone call between her and the congressman in which he allegedly instructed her to ‚Äúlie about the origin of her bruises.‚Äù  Mills ‚Äúvehemently denies any wrongdoing whatsoever.‚Äù  The Independent has contacted Mills‚Äôs office for comment.",T_Shurt,2025-05-05T23:06:42,942

They had lost their fortune by the time he came along. But marrying the rich heiress first wife from Seattle gave him the means to live the life he felt he deserved. Then she left and had remained totally silent about their marriage. Then he married the rich widow of Senator John Heinz, from the ketchup fortune. More money. His house in Boston is the only place in the city that is not compliant with the fire codes because he had a fire hydrant removed from in front of his house. He exaggerated his behavior in the Swift Boat saga. He was there, but he was just there. He did very little of what he claimed he did. It‚Äôs just like this story.
