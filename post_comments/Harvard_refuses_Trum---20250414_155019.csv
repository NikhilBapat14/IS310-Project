Just kept repeating how the Trump Administration should 'go through the proper channels to resolve violations to the Civil Rights Act of 1964'     Very clear that even he knows Harvard is in deep \*\*\*\* with regards to handling antisemitism complaints, and is giving the typical lawyer non-answer",WoodPear,2025-04-14T16:33:37,29
