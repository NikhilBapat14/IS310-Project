"The problem with a student loan is that it's for education. By definition, this means it's extended to young people with little to no assets for collateral, and is funding the purchase an intangible object (an education). As such, it must be an unsecured loan, but it needs to be at a low interest rate. How do we ensure the loan is paid back, but also ensure it's affordable in the first place? How do we ensure the loans go towards a useful education, but also ensure that schools don't count on them as an unlimited source of funds?  I say, *make the universities guarantee the loans*. If they don't get paid back in 10/15/20/whatever many years, the university owes the balance. A guaranteed loan can be extended without colateral from the student, and at a reasonable interest rate. Universities now have a reason to stop funding useless degrees, and for ensuring that their graduates are successful.¬†",What_is_a_reddot,2025-04-23T20:04:45,34

Well said.  üëç,M_i_c_K,2025-04-23T20:10:33,9
Yep I've said the same.  All loan payments are taken out of paychecks pre-tax at X% of the gross pay.  If after X years there is still a loan balance then the school has to forgive the remainder and eat the difference.  It would also force schools to price degrees more in-line with expected earning potential so that someone isn't getting a $200k English degree that they have no hope of ever paying back.,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-04-25T12:01:15,2

True but then the left would complain because people won't get admitted to school for a degree in underwater basket weaving.,caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-24T18:26:18,1
That‚Äôs because they expect school to be free. Little do they realize that all it will do is devalue everyone‚Äôs education.,dottedoctet,2025-04-23T22:53:43,5
