"Looking into this, despite me disliking him (he's the Dem I hate the most, honestly), I'm on Newsom's side. The legislators can change Cali shitty consent laws at any time assuming the issue is parents exploiting them.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-29T19:48:24,5
"This is a really weird issue. In other places Democrats push for an end to child marriage why would they be against prostitution laws for minors?  Well I did some digging. There is precious little information on what the sticking points have been with this legislation.  >In 2007, twice in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2017 and three times in 2021, legislators tried and failed to reclassify child sex trafficking  Thats a lot of years where we didnt dig down and find a compromise. I dont know the details on those bills who torpedoed them and why but thats... an issue.  So [this](https://calmatters.org/justice/2023/07/child-trafficking-bill-california-legislature/) article addresses when the prior bill was passed at the last moment by public pressure despite opposition.  The reasoning appears to be the same as always, it would punish people of color and extend prison sentences, and apply to the people at the lowest level.  A data point I dont have is whether this law requires knowledge of the person's age.  There is a weird comment here:  >the advocacy group Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition wrote in opposition to the bill. “If anything, low-level individuals involved in human trafficking will be prosecuted under this legislation, many of them will be prosecuted for conduct done under duress or other pressures, and they will be easily and swiftly replaced.”  I dont understand how someone is being forced to purchase someone for sex.  I think [this](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook-pm/2025/04/29/newsom-krell-sex-trafficking-00316984) article is in reference to the latest bill:  >As opponents to the bill reiterated during the hearing today, Democrats want to remove 16- and 17-year-olds in large part because they fear parents upset about interracial or LGBTQ relationships involving older teens could prompt them to weaponize solicitation laws.  Missing from the first article but okay, so if we are worried about false reports, couldnt we simply add elements that make it a crime to falsely report or otherwise address these issues? And I have to ask, there are already stiff penalties associated with this activity according to the previous article, so do we have cases we can hold up as evidence? How many? (though this is contradicted by other articles which claim that this is a misdemeanor)  >Human trafficking of a minor for purposes of commercial sex under current law incurs a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. If the crime involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, the sentence is 15 years to life. If the person is convicted of inflicting great bodily harm on the victim while trafficking them, a judge can add up to 10 years to a prison sentence.",realKevinNash,2025-04-29T19:10:04,8

the people who actually conduct the day to day business of prostitution arent running the show.  its usually another victim. like if you bust people who are actually selling drugs you're not doing anything to actually impede the organized crime or stop the distribution.  you're just picking up burnout 15 year olds from the neighborhood,Funny-Mission-2937,2025-04-29T19:26:33,10
"Regarding false reports: making false reports to police is already a crime. It is not a crime that is enforced much at all. The reason? Prosecutors and law enforcement don’t want to discourage actual victims from reporting a crime based on fears that they might be prosecuted if insufficient evidence is uncovered during an investigation.  I don’t know enough about this bill or its amendments to say whether Newsom or the legislators seeking to remove older teens are “right,” but the above is why criminalizing false reporting doesn’t do much to protect those who will be arrested and investigated because of those false reports.",Cautious-Progress876,2025-04-29T19:38:59,2
The only thing I can think of is if an IR or LGBTQ couple was together and the parents didnt like it they could say they saw the adult giving the minor money (no matter what it was for) and it must have been for sex. But without reading the text of the law I dont know for certain.,realKevinNash,2025-04-29T21:31:50,2
