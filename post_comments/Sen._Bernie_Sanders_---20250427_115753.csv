"We have 3 paths forward basically:  1. The status quo. Keep running at a deficit, see if the money finally starts trickling down to the lower classes out of charity, try to manage aggressive inflation, almost certainly spiral towards economic collapse.  2. Keep taxation roughly where it is, or only raise it modestly, and aggressively cut spending. See how society operates with a drastically reduced defense budget, reduces public services, reduced healthcare subsidies.  3. Attack capitalism. Jack up corporate tax, implement a wealth tax, put price controls on things like food, gas, healthcare, and energy, possibly profit controls. Call the bluff and see if the rich people and corporations can find somewhere else to go. Best case this will likely hurt the stock market and other investments, but something has got to give.

"As a foreigner looking at the US political system, it's fucked up. Why is it that Americans only get to pick between Democrats and Republicans? In Malaysia, Singapore and Canada, there are multiple political parties, and healthcare is pretty accessible.  Also, I feel that people should vote/elect based on the politician's past records, not their party. For example, Jerome Powell is a registered Republican, but he's trying to balance the rates rather than give in to Trump. And that more young people should enter politics, instead worrying they're not qualified.  As for healthcare in the US, I believe reforms are possible. One can set a ceiling price to medicines, or even provide subsidies. If the US wants references on how to do it, they can refer to so many countries that are doing so.  The weird thing I see about US is that there's this rhetoric that socialism is against capitalism and there can only be one. In many countries, both socialism and capitalism coexist, for example in Malaysia and Singapore, we have affordable public housing, public transport, and public healthcare and still have private companies as well for those sectors, it is up to the consumer to choose.",BrokeAFpotato,2025-04-27T14:51:24,14

"As bad as things are right now, it is important to keep things in perspective.  Even within the living memory, there was a time period where the FBI was used murder black leaders in the civil rights movement.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred\_Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton)    Even under the worst of Jim Crow and the constant threat of not just imprisonment but death, civil rights leaders were able to create a vision, to sell a dream that created real, meaningful change.  The work remains unfinished but despite the best efforts of Republicans, the foundation they built, if cracked, remains.    So far, the Democrats and their leadership aren't under the same kind of immediate threat civil rights leaders were.  They still have their comfortable desks and more wealth than they know what to do with, still have opportunity, responsibility, to lay out a way forward, to stop the downward descent before it reaches the point that they have cause to fear for their lives.  None of this is to say that Trump won't sink to that level, it has been three months and we're approaching that point fast, but we aren't there yet which makes every moment wasted 'reaching across the aisle' and giving the administration exactly what they want to solidify their power (looking at you, Chuck) is so damning.  I think part of the reason that Sanders is such an important voice in this moment in history is he didn't just live through the civil rights movement, he fought through it.  He wasn't just there, he was involved.  He organized, he marched, he fought, he even was arrested for it.

He described the party as fully under the control of Hillary’s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Under FEC law, an individual can contribute a maximum of $2,700 directly to a presidential campaign. But the limits are much higher for contributions to state parties and a party’s national committee.  >Individuals who had maxed out their $2,700 contribution limit to the campaign could write an additional check for $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund—that figure represented $10,000 to each of the 32 states’ parties who were part of the Victory Fund agreement—$320,000—and $33,400 to the DNC. The money would be deposited in the states first, and transferred to the DNC shortly after that. Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state, but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.  >“Wait,” I said. “That victory fund was supposed to be for whoever was the nominee, and the state party races. You’re telling me that Hillary has been controlling it since before she got the nomination?”  >Gary said the campaign had to do it or the party would collapse.  >“That was the deal that Robby struck with Debbie,” he explained, referring to campaign manager Robby Mook. “It was to sustain the DNC. We sent the party nearly $20 million from September until the convention, and more to prepare for the election.”  So Hillary was using a party fund, set aside for the election, not the primary, to pay for her campaign and to bypass FEC regs on donations so her big donors could contribute more than would normally be legally allowed to.  More than that, however:   >**Right around the time of the convention**, the leaked emails revealed Hillary’s campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races. A [Politico story published on May 2, 2016](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670), described the big fund-raising vehicle she had launched through the states the summer before, quoting a vow she had made to rebuild “the party from the ground up … when our state parties are strong, we win. That’s what will happen.”  >Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding, just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August. When the Politico story described this arrangement as “essentially … money laundering” for the Clinton campaign, Hillary’s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie’s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.  Hillary was looting funding for down ballot races, kneecapping other Democrats running for lower offices to ensure she got her ticket to the Whitehouse, taking 99.5% of the funds she claimed were for state parties for the use of her campaign.",Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-04-27T15:58:58,0

"Why would a random redditor be asked for the numbers? The elected officials should benchmark what other nations already do. Your question presupposes that we're in uncharted territory and that I need all the answers before suggesting it. But this isn't a fantasy hypothetical and the answers already exist for experts to see. But if you want what my philosophical values would be:  The UBI amount would scale to cost of living in the state. Maybe something like... 30% to 40% of the average cost of living of things such as a 1 bedroom rent, utilities, and food expenses? In the more expensive states, that could be a good $1000 per month. Most states would probably calculate less, as low as maybe $500 per month.   Asking me to identify the rich is a pretty bad faith question, as you already know the answer is that the more rich someone is, the more they should pay. You know I'm not going to say that if you make 500k, you should pay 100% income tax. We absolutely don't need tax specifics in a mere suggestion post. But again, if you want my philosophical values:  I would want a tax system that prevents billionaires from existing. If you made that much in a year, you'd be taxed however much would be needed to prevent a billionaire from existing. If your company got that huge, you'd be prevented from owning enough of it to be a billionaire. Once an action would make someone worth 1 billion dollars, the law would either forbid that action or tax them for the amount that would prevent billionaire status. The further you are from being a billionaire, the less aggressive the taxation. If you have $1 million, I don't think your taxes really need to go up from where they are now. But if you have 100 million, I'm alright with taxing you close to 90% of whatever you got that year. Personally, I would want to prevent anything over $100 million being in one household. I think society would be fine if capped it at $10 million really. But for the sake of appeasing most Americans and most donors, I'll settle with eliminating billionaires. That would free up plenty of money to do the UBI on its own: billionaires are worth over 6 trillion in the US. Reducing them to 1 billion each would free up enough money to give about $15,000 per year to 350 million adult age Americans. And my UBI concept maxed out at like 12k per year and is generally more like 8k. So we could give UBI AND do some other ""radical"" left project just by getting rid of billionaires.",the_toad_can_sing,2025-04-27T14:08:18,1

Also, for high corporate taxes- over 15% of the burden is usually transferred on workers. Through a combination of income control and increase in prices of the final consumer product. The rest of it can go to shareholders- which includes people with 401ks.",Individual-Camera698,2025-04-27T16:40:56,2
"Sorry your premium sucked. I had an ACA plan too for a bit and it was expensive but I had coverage when I didn’t have a full time job. But what’s your point? That Dems knowingly wrote a bill to benefit the insurance industry? That they shouldn’t have passed the ACA at all, since there was no way to get a public option through the senate? Something else?  Edit: I’d also add that republicans immediately began chipping away at some of the ACA provisions when they retook Congress and via the courts, so it’s not like what we have today represents what was passed then either.",eggoed,2025-04-28T12:46:30,1
"There it is. Y’all have no idea whatsoever what you’re talking about. You want a Dem Senator from WVa? Good luck. Manchin was the last one we get from that state in a long long time. No other Dem could have won that seat for that long in that blood red state. Just absolute ignorance.  You can cannibalize what allies you do have out of misguided rage, or you can get to 50 Senate seats. You can’t do both.",eggoed,2025-04-27T18:44:44,3
"My only point is tat the ACA (as a whole) wasn't as great as its been made out to be. I'm not alone in this, everyone I know who had insurance _not_ provided by an employer saw their rates triple, or near triple in that 3 year span of time.",avds_wisp_tech,2025-04-28T12:50:29,1
"If you don’t think a pro-union, free healthcare campaign would work in West Virginia then it is you who are delusional.",-The_Guy_,2025-04-27T18:47:18,-1
Ok. I’m not holding it up as some flawless thing. Mainly just pushing back on other folks here who only know how to rage shit on Dems actually making meaningful improvements.,eggoed,2025-04-28T12:55:06,1

"It’s funny everyone on here resorts to calling folks delusional when they have no real data to back up their point, just vibes. Find who you want and support them or boost them on Reddit or whatever. There are better Senate races where seats can be flipped than WVa, but hey you’re the expert. Good luck.",eggoed,2025-04-27T18:52:56,-2
Maybe you should reread your initial response to me then. I do want to apologize though as it is now clear you just lack object permanence.,-The_Guy_,2025-04-27T18:54:32,1
