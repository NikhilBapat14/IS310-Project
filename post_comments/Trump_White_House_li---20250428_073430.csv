I have voted for republicans many times in my life so far despite being only 39. I voted for Bush. I voted for McCain. I considered Romney a legitimate option. Despite disagreeing with varying aspects of previous republican administrations, I never really had any reason to doubt that those previous republicans loved this country and wanted to do what they thought was in the best interest of its citizens. DJT makes me question his motives nearly every day if not multiple times a day. The stuff that MAGA lovers accept from him just astonishes me.

"The judicial system still has teeth it can bite with, however; lawsuits are a lengthy process and without the SCOTUS to provide some definitive ruling and enforcement, it may take far longer than the administration will be in power for. Criminal proceedings are tricky due to the SCOTUS ruling (***Trump v. United States***, 603 U.S. 593) giving the POTUS wide latitude over their actions being non-prosecutable (subject to Judiciary review).   Now, the DOJ has lost a lot of great talent and is having trouble properly staffing attorneys (especially competent ones) to these lawsuits that have already arisen. That could be a great way to expedite some of these lawsuits due to poor counsel, but there is always the appeal route (which they have exercised in almost all cases) that adds months to years of backlog to these cases and almost certainly they would take many of these up to the SCOTUS which only hears about 60 cases a year. This is one of the key advantages to the ""flood the zone"" strategy that has benefitted Trump last administration and currently. They know this, Pam Bondi sure as shit knows this, and they are trying to cripple the judiciary against actually being able to reliably prosecute them on this. The ""X factor"" in all of this is the large body and fraternity of judges they've managed to piss off through the arrest of the Wisconsin judge combined with a clear middle finger to rulings the Trump administration has exercised. Judges can decidedly expedite proceedings and rulings, but the appeal is, nonetheless, the Achille's heel in all of this.   The tricky bit as well is if something such as a a defamation suit were to make its way to the SCOTUS, it is hard to determine what the ruling would be. On the one hand, it is clear to most in the law profession that jurisdiction extends to those who are not citizens as they are within our borders and thus subject to such jurisdiction unless protected by diplomatic immunity. If the SCOTUS were to rule against the Trump administration, then great, lawsuits inbound and the Trump administration becomes hamstrung with a litany of lawsuits against them. If the SCOTUS rules in favor of the Trump administration, well, that would effectively require the erosion of the meaning ""jurisdiction"" as it pertains and is utilized within the Constitution which has some more dire outcomes and significance to the rule of law int his country. I'm not entirely confident in this SCOTUS to rule reasonably (we can assume Thomas and Alito will rule for the Trump admin) and thus undermine the law in a severely damaging way. Although, again, Trump has managed to piss off the SCOTUS pretty badly so time will tell if they rebuke him further with his brazen lack of adherence to the law and judges' rulings.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-04-28T11:10:32,1

Groups whom ICE have targeted for trafficking out of the US (where Trump’s lawyers claim even SCOTUS does not have jurisdiction): immigrants, non-white US citizens. Includes people who were also disabled, LGBTQ+, protestors (not sure about union organizers or homeless people, but both are likely given the volume).   Groups who have been illegally arrested/detained: judges, immigrants, protestors. Cops of course also have a long history of targeting queer people, black people, disabled people, homeless people, and other minority groups, but I guess this gets a caveat because it was the status quo well before Trump.   Groups who have been targeted with EOs, judicial, legal, or legislative action: immigrants, trans people, intersex people, unions/union organizers, disabled people, journalists, people who aren’t white, Muslims, women. Early stage legal attacks against gay marriage. And of course the US has a long history of criminalizing homelessness.   Groups who have been targeted with rhetoric: trans people, intersex people, other queer people, judges and political opposition, protestors and union organizers, autistic people and other disabled people, journalists and whistleblowers, homeless people, anyone who isn’t white (DEI is a dogwhistle), women, non-Christian religions, many other countries and their populations, and as of this week we can include Catholics too.",VitaDiMinerva,2025-04-28T11:11:10,4

It also tells you to throw rocks at women for speaking in public or at men who shave their beards  Or feed poison to your wife if she's pregnant and you don't want the kid and if it induces an abortion she was cheating on you  Of if you rape a woman the punishment is paying her father and you have to marry her  All that to say it doesn't matter what the book says. They've never critically analyzed it and they're socialized by their book club into thinking the ends justify the means and as long as they tell their imaginary friends they feel bad it's ok they did a little genocide,Satanarchrist,2025-04-28T09:33:06,4

"I absolutely understand where you're coming from, but here's a counterpoint:   Show me how their behavior is different from that of an aggressive pack of dogs. Show me where they've demonstrated any form of conscious self-reflection or any of the other mental capacities that make humans unique from the rest of the animal kingdom. Show me exactly what differentiates them from animals acting on base instinct, bc I've looked, and I am not seeing ANY humanity. Just violent, disgusting animals.   And that doesn't make me a Nazi, or ""just as bad as they are"", to say that. It just means I have eyes and can see that these people have gleefully surrendered any humanity they may have had, just to feel superior.   Were they born violent, disgusting animals? No, ofc not. But they absolutely are now, and that was their CHOICE -- the last choice they made as humans before they descended into wild, despicable cruelty. So no, I'm not dehumanizing them. They did that to themselves.  (And frankly, even calling them animals is a bit offensive to the other species we usually refer to as animals, bc at least those species aren't doing it on purpose, as far as we know. If there's any argument to be made that these assholes are still humans and deserve to be treated as such, it's that no other animals delight in cruelty the way Trump voters do.)",abitbuzzed,2025-04-28T18:13:18,0
