"My response doesn't cover every issue that the right and left argue about, but there are a number of issues that conservatives simply have a simple answer to which they can easily coalesce around. Being conservative inherently means you would like to conserve the status quo or possibly revert back to a known quantity.   So if you take health care, for example, conservatives simply have to say they don't want anything to change and come together on that. On the progressive side, they might all agree that the current situation isn't good, but that's about all they'll agree on. Once you get to the point of actually coming up with a plan, you'll find that some progressives want a single payer system, some want insurance company regulation change, and some want something else entirely. So it's hard to agree on exactly what progress you want to make, but it's easy to simply say ""no"" to proposed changes.   In my opinion, that's why it appears that the left is all over the place and the right is lock step together in everything.",Head_Nerd_In_Charge,2025-04-09T17:42:58,73
"My view is that right wing ideals offer simple solutions to complex problems. Leftist views are often more nuanced and are a bigger societal lift.

Senate Republicans have literally said to reporters that they fear for their lives over Trump‘s unhinged minions. That’s why they don’t dare break with him.  Because republicans severely punish disloyalty.   It’s also why Republicans have idiotic policies.

"No. Recency bias has made people forget that there have been many times in the last two decades where the narrative was ""Democrats are united. Why can't the Republicans have party discipline like the dems do?""   Genuinely as early as the last midterms, where the GOP got crushed after expecting a red wave, this question was being asked.    What it comes down to is that parties want to win, and so they will rally around whoever they think has the best chance of winning. When their champion falls the party goes into disarray for awhile while trying to figure out what the new strategy is.    The GOP has gone all-in on MAGA as a winning ticket. Neoliberalism has failed the Dems twice in 3 elections so now they're trying to figure out whether to keep the strategy or try something else.

"Right-wing ideology is more authoritarian, meaning they force the lower rungs to obey the top rungs, and they do it by telling the lower rungs that they will have more control over their lives if they obey. Essentially a pyramid scheme of ‘do as I say and you will be rewarded’.   This isn’t always the case though, usually the lower rungs just get screwed over because the top rungs didn’t really care about them.

"> Could it be related to psychological traits, such as a stronger focus on loyalty, tradition, and group identity? Or is it more about the moral foundations that conservatives tend to emphasize, like loyalty and authority? Perhaps it’s about how left-wing movements often involve a broader range of causes, which might make coalition-building more challenging?  It's none of these.  The infighting usually happens before the final product on the right, while the left prefers to air theirs out as part of the formulation period.  It's just a style situation at the moment, and one that would have looked completely different 15 years ago when the left was firmly behind the Obama administration and the right couldn't coalesce.  > I also notice a lot of left-wing infighting, which could be contributing to this dynamic. I'm curious what others think. Why do you think one side seems to unite more easily than the other?  I'd argue that the right has needed to compromise with itself for decades because of so many competing interests that are actually in opposition to each other, and it's the left that tends to fall in line seeing as the disagreements tend to be more on the degree of change rather than the foundation.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-09T16:45:09,8

"They conform to a group standard that makes them more similar. The more similar people are, the more uniform they are, literally. While that uniformity means they lack adaptability and can't handle change as well, their greater similarity means a stronger extent of unity. They can succeed at fewer situations than the diverse, but they succeed to a greater extent when they do because they all think, feel and act the same, so it makes a more efficient system.  The left values diversity, which makes unity more difficult and creates a limit of unity. They can only unite to the extent they are similar and can agree. Diversity can succeed in a wider range of situations, but succeed to a lesser extent in any given situation because they don't all think, feel and act the same, so it makes a less efficient system.  Diversity is strongest when things are dynamic and complex, uniformity is strongest when things are static and simple. The right doesn't need to account for everyone's unique perspectives, thoughts, feelings and values. That is genuinely costly for a society to do, being inclusive. The right doesn't carry that cost because there is far less diversity of perspectives, thoughts, feelings and values.",news_feed_me,2025-04-10T01:10:25,2

It doesn’t matter how or what they do, just as long as they throw sand in the gears they’re happy.  Liberals want to improve things and make things better. Where the left runs into trouble is there are dozens of things to make better (equality, healthcare, education, voting, etc) and thousands of ways to accomplish any of them so liberals and the left fracture easily because there are a gazillion ways to disagree.",Blahkbustuh,2025-04-10T11:26:03,2

"It's something psychological, yes. I used to identify as a socialist, and because of personal circumstances, I've oftentimes been invited to overwhelmingly left-wing spaces.  There's no side-stepping the obvious problem that -western- left-wing communities are full of severe dysfunction, backstabbing, and melodrama. I don't even see a lot of people on the left deny this, they just begrudgingly accept it and ask ""well, what am I supposed to do, abandon my beliefs just because the people around me are annoying and bad friends and can't do optics?""  And honestly, at some point, it may be worth updating the priors. I think there is a through line that has to be acknowledged. At the very minimum, it means that the people on your side are not able to effectively organize to turn your ideas into policy and you have to go back to square one.  There's really no equivalency that can be made on the right, because right-wing infighting happens at a higher level and is primarily about politics. The kind of unrelated infighting that happens in left-wing communities is literally unbelievable to people who aren't involved in them.

"The answer is pretty straightforward:  Republicans tend to want *less* federal government intervention and programs, and more governance deferred to the states.  Everyone agrees.  The Democrats want redistribution which means alignment on (a) who to take it from and (b) who to give it to.  That’s a problem because only thing people can truly agree on is “tax people who make more then me, nor me” and “give it to me or my community”.  So when the democratic base is hugely varied identities and income levels, they just can’t agree on either of those things.  All they can agree on is that the billionaires are bad. Which is perfectly true enough from a fairness perspective, but billionaire level tax isn’t enough to pay for what they want, it won’t even close the deficit.   The Democrats could credibly roll back Bush and Trump era tax cuts which would cover maybe half the deficit while risking it slowing economic growth / jobs, but it wouldn’t pay for net new stuff.

"Ultimately, and very generally, the right wing actually wants to win elections and succeed in their goals.   The left wing seems unable to see past their nose, and so instead of doing things that might actually win them elections and achieve their goals, they engage in purity tests and circular firing squads. It seems like the left wing, especially the more vocal aspects of it, are more interested in feeling good about themselves than actually getting things done. Lots of virtue signaling, etc, with no real substance to their actions. Ironically, much of what these people do actually harms their goals and alienates potential allies, more than it helps their goals and attracts new allies.  The right wing's goals are generally easier to achieve, and often amounts to eliminating things, destroying things, dismantling things, etc. It's much easier to dismantle than it is to build.   The left wing's goals require structure and nuance, which the left wing is simply unable to unite around.   The most vocal aspects of both wings want to see the world as a black and white place, with no room for nuance. While this sometimes does, and sometimes does not, work to the benefit of the right wing, it almost always works to the detriment of the left wing.   Republicans would be happy with a 5% tax cut, and even happier with a 10% tax cut.   Meanwhile, the Democrats might propose a 5% tax increase (to, say, fund social services), but the hard leftists (that may not even vote in the next election, anyways) will claim that 5% isn't enough, and that the mainstream Democrats are fascists for not proposing a 20% tax increase.

"There’s actually some history behind how this divide started, at least in the US. A guy named Richard T. Ely in the late 1800s had this idea that you could combine Christian good Samaritan values with government. Instead of hoping people helped the poor, why not just mandate it? Use taxes, laws, and policy to make people be good. That mindset kicked off a shift in American politics where “compassion” got tied to state power, and that’s pretty much the root of modern progressivism.  Psychologically, the left builds everything around empathy. That sounds good on paper, but the issue is that they’ve moralized their empathy to the point that any disagreement looks like cruelty. They’ve framed every issue through a narrow emotional lens. Everything becomes life or death, oppressed or oppressor, ally or enemy. That doesn’t leave room for nuance. And when that empathy is weaponized, it justifies things like censorship or violence because they’re “protecting” people. But if your empathy only works when people agree with you, it’s not really empathy, it’s control.  The right looks at things differently. We value freedom, even if that means people fail. That gets us painted as heartless, but it’s not that we don’t care, we just think helping someone means giving them tools, a hand up, not a handout. We also don’t expect everyone on our side to think exactly the same. We can argue about policy, religion, economics, and still respect each other. So, it might look like we’re more unified, but really, we’re just more comfortable with disagreement. We don't have to kick people out of the tribe for not towing a line. We value disagreement and open dialogue.   So when you ask if there’s something more inherent to right-wing ideology that resists infighting, I’d say yeah, because we never assumed everyone had to be the same in the first place.

"The right-wing is not an identifiable politics the way the left is, it is a broad tendency that believes the survival of the established order requires the liquidation of old relations. It is a literal Blob. It is anti-political. That is why it works.   Most right-wing reactions in the last century have nothing to do with conservative political parties or even elections, they are the result of the needs of the state to manage crisis in an economic system inherently prone to crisis.  The origin of the terms “right” and “left” came from the French revolution. The French monarchy—the right—were not a party at all but represented the belief of the feudal class that the monarchy was a defender of liberty, including by fighting wars on the global stage against “British tyranny.” A version of this worldview had been previously expressed by French thinkers such as Henri de Boulainvilliers that feudalism defended the rights of Frenchmen, although he was more critical of the monarchy. The French monarchy was not conservative: the absolute monarchy ruled over the nobility, women were given power, minority rights were represented. They also deregulated the grain markets.  Right-wing “politics” dissolves social boundaries in order to stunt and retard the arrival of a modern technological civilization. This makes it easy for both ruling elite and compliant sections of the middle class to unify when there are no material needs creating divisions between them—industry, technology, revolution, trade-unions, class, race, immigration etc. They can all be on the same team.   Right-wingers prior to the 1840s were against the Industrial Revolution because they thought it would jeopardize these accomplishments. Women would lose their equality to men if they were forced to work in factories or participate in complicated public affairs, postoral life put everyone on the same level. This is why right-wing politics in the West was actually associated with women until the 1960s. Men voted for leftist parties.   This gets to the crux of the issue. The left represents the needs of material development, but studies (such as those by Jonathan Huebner) have shown that technological  progress peaked in the Western nations around 1873-1921.   The left tends (historically) tends to manifest as political parties and very concrete organizations because it represents material development, so you need to create groups to represent the rising economic interests. Liberalism represented the bourgeoisie, socialism represented the proletariat etc.   Since World War I, the left is not been unified because the economic world is not changing as fast as it once did. The left actually was unified under the Second International, but that was dissolved in 1916 and socialism declined as a movement—see Left-Wing Melancholy.",TrickSpeaker1077,2025-05-09T13:37:15,1

You can be firm in that conviction simply because autocracy has more bad outcomes for more morally interested subjects and because you are empathetic to oppressed people.

You aren't an ex-muslim like myself but the Quran is literally not just a 'bible' but rather a law book as well. Under sharia law, children are married to old men, 9 years old under islam law and 13 years old by sharia law. Us women have to live over egg shells under sharia law and our rights and equality are reduced. Those who refuse to fight for Hamas are also executed, those in Gaza who protest against Hamas are punished and killed too. By left logic, we should persecute Hamas, his fighers and the Palestinians as a nation, just like Israel.   Why dont we do that? ... you're absolutely right, they're not all bad, just like israelis. Both Israelis government and Hamas (Palestinian government) are the ones who should be held accountable, not one side or a people as a whole. However the lefts ignore this and rules with hypocrisy and arrogance, discrediting Mossab Yousef (son of hamas) off conspiracies. He had evidence, he lived through it, and going against your father in middle eastern culture is more extreme than what you find in prevalence to western culture. Why isnt the massacre of those in Syria who are of different religion be fought against too, by definition it's genocide. How about Sudanese Christians being executed? How about Hinduism people being targeted in the attack in Kashmir? How about jewish tourist being bashed overseas on the streets?    Christianphobia is littered amongst left polticial people, and yet they tell people how terrible islamphobia is. They accuse my white friends for being white males as an insult. I get called hypocritical when my family lived through one of the worse genocide in history, and that I was ex-muslim, what arrogance for those who didn't live through it or practice it to tell me how I should think.  Modern day activism has begun blaming skin colour, demographics and religion of a whole culture off the actions of a few, something activism back then stood against. Don't you see the hypocrisy and understand why the left is losing their legitimacy to the right wing who are often called facist by the left.   Left poltiics have started to pick and choose who to protect and who to persecute, when and where of their choosing. They attack and behave viciously to those who may not have an opinion or disagree with their views, trying to demoralise, insult and yell at those people. It's become the very thing it was made to stand against, and now filled with arrogant people who find themselves too self righteous to look at all angles to combat an issue.

"I'm also against authtorian extremist as everyone deserves to find their own path of enlightenment. It's just the lesser of two evils would have to be right for me if forced to choose, although I prefer to take the good on both sides.   Hamas reminds me alot about what Pol pot did to us in cambodia. From executing those with different beliefs, foreign influence and sexualities no doubt if it was more prevalent back then. He executed protestors and those refusing to fight, allowed his soldiers to rape those in concentration camps like Hamas fighters on the hostages. Pol pot invaded Vietnam because south Vietnam used to be cambodian, he took over the government and executed the above, including ones who opposes him. Hamas is doing the same thing in manner and principle. The world blamed Vietnam for years and during, for Cambodia's massacre, but it was later found out Vietnam saved us and as someone from both communities, they very well did end the genocide by seemingly genociding those who committed horrors on us in the killing fields. The left are legitimising Hamas, indirectly or knowingly, and It's horrorfying how idiotic they became. Of course Israel have gone beyond retaliation but Hamas needs to be focused and not glorified, then we handle Israel politicians who are guilty for civilian bombings, however modern warfare, bigger bombs, larger threat to send soldiers in on foot.",Metatron-Mutation,2025-04-29T12:41:14,1

"Can we stick with left-wing ideologies then? Leftist doesn’t mean shit, L-wI signals that we are talking about groups of ideologies that are compatible with each other to varying degrees. Proletarianism, socialism, liberalism, populism, communalism.   R-wI’s would be like authoritarianism, fascism, patriotism, jingoism, meritocracy viewed through wealth accumulation (so actually plutocracy), reactionism, paternalism, individualism, stratocracy, isolationism.   These two categories could be argued over because all elements are not always there for either. For instance, socialism and communalism and proletarianism generally aren’t practiced by democratic politicians today, but that is because the party is closer to centrism than L-wI’s.   You can have authority and not practice authoritarianism. 1. An army doesn’t stay together just bc they are getting paid wages by an organization, they have loyalist and patriotic ideologies playing into their members motives to keep unit cohesion. 2. Some people are better at leading, some are better at or prefer following, but organization doesn’t need to be driven by authoritarian rule.

"It sounds like hair-splitting to distinguish between authoritarianism and authoritative. I’m not really seeing a difference.   Throughout many administrations we have seen executive agencies push policies disguised as laws, complete with arbitrary penalties and none of this went through the democratic process beyond the initial creation of these agencies by Congress. Congress just creates an agency and denies any responsibility after that. Department of Ed., ATF, EPA, DHS, etc. just arbitrarily make rules and penalties for many, many things. This is not democratic and the blame belongs with both parties. SCOTUS kind of put a damper on that last year, I think, but who knows how that will eventually play out.   I know Biden and Trump have both signed numerous executive orders, but it certainly didn’t begin with them. I’m really pressed for time lately, so I can’t compile lists. My opinion is that Congress created much of this by essentially writing the current president (whoever that might be) a mostly blank check by creating executive agencies and then saying, “Go and do whatever you need to do in order to complete your mission.”  Well, the mission could potentially be redefined with each administration if adequate controls were not put in place originally.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-14T14:59:45,1

"I looked up a Reddit eli5 about liberalism vs neoliberalism, and it said neoliberalism was supported by Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, so calling it left-wing seems odd to me in that context. I saw elements of it being left-wing, like denying someone the right to not sell their cake to someone they don’t want to, but it very much otherwise seemed sort of right-wing with opening up markets (tho I don’t necessarily see that as right-wing). Liberalism, or classical liberalism also had elements both favored by both wings.   So I can agree that multiple isms can and have been used by both parties (Trump for instance used populist sentiments to grow his base without fully holding any position after in office). In light of that I took to Wikipedia, and I’d ask if we continue this conversation we both read this wiki page’s https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left–right_political_spectrum top portion, contemporary terminology, and criticism sections (I read them and thought they’d be useful enough).   I think with that as a grounding for left vs right wing we can then further keep discussing.

"I would say it’s not hair-splitting, but I could understand why you feel that way.   Authority can give reasons (and evidence) for suggestions/orders. Authority is aware of the power differentials between the expert and layperson and makes every reasonable effort to eliminate or minimise them. Authoritarianism means hiding behind the cloak of ‘respectability’ and hierarchy, wanting blind obedience; government by technocrats, dismissing dissent as ignorance. Some of the obvious smear words used by authoritarians against opponents they don’t want to engage with are: luddites, anti-progress, “selfish Westerners.”  There is a difference if you look into the meaning of each. Language is complex, and it’s only gotten more complex with the advent of written history.   The agencies you speak of were created to deal with matters that require experts to use their authority in said fields to make sure laypeople aren’t trampled over, versus congress needing to be experts in all areas and make specific rules. A good example is RFK Jr. spreading propaganda about autism and safety in regard to vaccines. He is using the Trump administrations authority to promote skepticism in sound science, thus turning it authoritarian. A healthy agency uses their expertise and labor to produce reasonable policy in better ways than congress could.   We have seen experts in their own fields become complete fools when assigned to agencies they had no right to run, Ben Carson being a good example. Brilliant surgeon by all standards I’ve heard of, but terrible pick for HUD (housing and urban development) (see wiki for more info, it has a good section).   I guess from what I’m reading you want congress people like Majorie Taylor Greene directly leading agencies, rather than nominating experts to lead said agencies? You want every policy to first become law before it can be enacted and enforced? You want way more beauracratic red tape before anything gets done?

"…Anthony Fauci, Alejandro Mayorkas, Pete Buttigieg…yeah, I understand.   This is an inherent problem and I’m not sure what to do about. Political appointees tend to become political, or at least influenced by political entities. Maybe Congress needs to find a happy medium. They could narrowly likit the scopes for these agencies.   You and I might disagree about things like bump stocks, barrel length and other firearm rules, but do we want an individual who is appointed to lead the ATF (or any other agency) to just make (or remove) rules that carry the weight of laws, complete with penalties without Congress weighing in?  I understand that Congress doesn’t have time to vote over every minute detail, but any new burden placed on the people should at least have some kind of vote by those who have been elected.  These changes could be submitted for a simple yea or nay vote at the very least, especially where penalties are involved.   Sound science is not truth. I am a firm believer in the scientific method, but brilliant scientists frequently disagree. Science is also constantly changing its mind, which is one of its strengths. Science should be considered when making public policy, but it’s not a monolith and shouldn’t be viewed that way, even when a majority of scientists in a particular field agree on a particular theory because it is still a theory. How many times during COVID did the science change during both administrations?  Some policy makers were getting whiplash from making direction changes so often. Others locked onto the first thing they heard and refused to change course. In these situations, it might be best to publish information as quickly as it becomes available and then let individuals make their own decisions.   Government agencies are not nimble. Once they collect what they believe to be the facts, they are very reactionary until they decide on new rules. Then it can be nearly impossible to get them to change course. They have either moved on to other things or they don’t want to be seen as indecisive, so we end up with rules that were created in a knee-jerk response to something that made headlines.   I don’t want individual congress members to run executive agencies. I want Congress to have more oversight and to act as a check against reactionary policy making.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-15T17:45:54,1

"Well, from wiki on authoritarianism: Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law.[1][2] Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military.  Any L-wI can be implemented since L-wIs aren’t to reject political plurality, they aren’t stifling democracy, they respect the separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law. L-wIs gain their power from the legitimacy of their votes through honest discussion rather than lies, fear, hatred, and overall not pushing authoritarianism. A state that has willful participation doesn’t require force to get its way.   I’m not an avid historian, but the USSR decided to put loyalty to a single-state party rather than a plurality of parties or factions. You were either for the party or you were working against the party. The call to authoritarianism to get your way is easy, but educating the masses that will then willfully and actively push back against such calls is always an important policy.   We have right-leaning politicians dismantling the department of education, putting in incompetent leadership to facilitate that dismantling, cancelling lead pipe removal in WI schools bc they fired all the staff that would help with that at the HHS which hurts all generations of youth, FL and TX re-writing history textbooks to call slavery “not so bad”, the Trump administration re-writing history by calling everything they don’t like DEI and hiding or removing it, etc.   L-w parties can descend into authoritarianism, but we’ve generally seen R-w parties glorify in it time and again, we’re in fact seeing it now, so maybe consider laying criticisms on all parties when they do it and not giving our favored parties leeway to commit such atrocities as authoritarianism.

"Do you think that instead of appointed bureaucrats for agency positions, elected bureaucrats would do better? EBs for short. Though tbf appointed bureaucrats are already chosen by the current administration and voted on by the senate, so they sort of are EBs. So to make them more electable, EBs would have to be voted on by citizens, maybe 3-4 weeks after the presidential election, and 3-4 weeks after any agency head drops out during an administration.   If EBs were to happen I’d say that the president chooses 1, the agency in question can put up 1 internal name, and outsiders can apply by getting a 20 senators or 90 house members to vouch for them (with limits to 2 per chamber). No real election season, the EBs get their info put up in a central location/website for people to view and comment/complain. Any EBs tied to lobbyists should have their clear loyalties displayed rather than hidden, and any uncovered subterfuge should disqualify them or get them fired.   As for limits to agencies, would you then be okay with more smaller agencies with specific goals? Would you be upset if bureaucracy grew to accommodate more agencies? What do you say to the fact that agency policy making already has judicial and congressional review?  I feel like your take on science is mainly correct but also a bit off. Saying that scientists frequently disagree without saying what they disagree on isn’t a claim on anything. Scientists could disagree on what’s for breakfast, or they could disagree on E=mc^(2), and without clarifying it’s just obfuscating what you’re trying to tell me. There are many different fields of science, so when a quantum physicist disagrees with a paleontologist on the paleontologist’s findings the quantum physicist is out of their knowledge comfort zone. Same with a quantum physicist disagreeing with another quantum physicist on a scientific hypothesis that’s new in their field, it’s new frontier so them disagreeing is different than them disagreeing on breakfast.   And a scientific hypothesis is rigorously tested and reviewed before it becomes a theory. Theories are generally held as the best approximation to fact that we have about such topics. No one doubts the theory of gravity for example, so I don’t know what theories you are talking about that people don’t trust.   Covid was a new and emerging disease in 2020, there were no theories about it besides the best ways to combat most diseases, which were updated as new limited info came in, but were also constantly pushed back against by people that believed they could prevent the disease through faith or politicians that wanted to score easy points with fearful constituents. Everywhere was afraid of coronaviruses before 2020 bc of SARS-cov, and while the COVID virus was relatively defeated as of now, it killed millions in a few years and left many with long COVID, something we still haven’t solved.   I’m just going to stop on science and say I disagree with you, as it can be its own talking point (science as well as covid).

"Making major changes to the scopes of individual agencies or creating a bunch of new ones is unlikely to happen and no, I’m not in favor of more bureaucracy. When forming these agencies, Congress should limit their authority. They could implement some policies, but should not be allowed to create law or penalties. They could make recommendations and Congress could just have an up or down vote. They have to answer to their constituents. Unelected bureaucrats don’t.   Scientists within the same discipline frequently disagree on theories within their fields. For example, the 97% agreement number we constantly hear about climate change is *only* in regard to the statement that temperatures have risen by 1° C (or whatever the exact number is) over the last X number of years. It also includes scientists who aren’t climatologists. They do not agree on the amount caused by humans (some is) or the implications of the warming. I’m not trying to start a climate debate here, just pointing out that the science isn’t “settled” as some people keep saying. Much more research is being done and needs to be done. Knee-jerk policies and associated penalties should not be subject to the whims of whoever is running the EPA at the moment.   COVID was a huge unknown, but that didn’t stop many policies from being unequally implemented at  various levels of government out of panic. Millions died, but COVID was blamed for many that it should not have been. Hospitals were financially incentivized to make COVID the cause of death, even when it wasn’t. People who died *with* COVID were lumped in with people who died *from* COVID. Deaths from influenza mysteriously went [down](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1124915/flu-deaths-number-us/) during those years. The reactionary policy-making caused companies to go out of business. Many people lost jobs. And nobody should ever be forced to have any substance injected into their bodies against their will unless they are being put to death for capital murder. I am specifically taking about unelected people unilaterally creating policy and implementing penalties out of panic. People were literally thrown in crowded jails for participating in an outdoor church service. How does that make any sense?  RFK, Jr. should be able to express his opinions and make his recommendations, but he should not be able to take away the opportunity for people to be vaccinated.

"What’s the point of making a policy that says you can’t dump polluted waste water into the river if you can’t make a penalty for breaking the policy?   Congress does not need to actually answer to its constituents. It’s why so few town halls are actually held, and why when they are most of them are tightly controlled and turn into rallies for the congress critters rather than actual town halls. We can see with current events that virtual town halls are being held instead of physical ones bc of all the backlash congress has been getting from its constituents, and even then not a lot of virtual town halls are happening.   Highlighting one scientific field that has a 97% consensus on climate change happening and being man made, but disagreeing on impact and amount is hardly disagreement, but I agree to stop having this part of a debate since it can’t go much of anywhere.   If you had Covid+something else and you died, Covid is one of the leading factors for death, is it not? If a person is shot and the bleed out to death, the bullet is still the main reason they died even as blood loss is culprit. I don’t understand why you think deaths related to Covid in that way wouldn’t also be counted as Covid.   It’s also not a mystery why influenza went down during this period if ppl were taking safety precautions that would prevent the spread of all diseases. Wearing a mask was as likely to protect from influenza particles as much as it was Covid particles. Distancing is good for the prevention of all diseases. Isolation is good for the prevention of all diseases. It’s not really a mystery unless you don’t know what types of things were done to prevent the spread of disease during the time period.

"American health care is a disgrace. I am old and disabled but luckily I live in the best state in the country for socialized health care. Since I am on social security disability and have no resources to speak of all of my healthcare is 100% free. Doctor's appointments, medications, even surgeries and mental health visits are 100% covered. My arthritis medication alone is over $100,000 per year. I think everybody should have the health care that I have. I am extremely disappointed in this nation's performance when it comes to health care and voting also. It's an embarrassment. Americans tend to be uneducated and conceited which is a dangerous combination. It looks like we are quickly becoming a failed democracy which is probably the correct outcome considering the stupidity and apathy of the voting population. Still, it makes me sad and angry to watch my country self destruct like this.",honuworld,2025-04-13T10:24:11,1
"RFK Jr. said autistic people will never find love, will never have a job, will never pay taxes, and yet we have ample examples of autistic people doing all those. As a prime example Elon Musk is autistic and still managed to greed his way to a huge fortune.   I have no idea about your luggage or bathroom claims.   The city settled with the litigants. The police acted excessively wrong, like they usually do. If lockdown mandates were present to prevent disease spread and people violated them, even if it’s within their 1st amendment right to assemble in a safer manner, it’s still defying mandates out of imagined special privilege.   You missed the mention that most companies/businesses around me seemed to have stayed in business throughout the lockdown and covid. I wasn’t claiming that just my business is representative of every business. There’s also the fact that 10-20% of business startups don’t make it and that restaurants have particularly slim margins and likely would have a hard time surviving during early covid.   Covid particles are smaller and thus more likely to slip through masks, so whereas a mask can give some protection it isn’t foolproof. Flu and other diseases are bigger particles so they are likelier to get stopped by masks. Not to mention that people were warned and were better with their sanitation methods during early covid so it was eliminating a lot of common vectors that common diseases took to infect people. Considering rates rose again as efforts to prevent spread waned, it would indicate that prevention helped. Heck, the initial lockdowns were to buy time so that the healthcare industry wouldn’t be overwhelmed as much and could acquire more robust ppe gear supply routes.  Scientists agree on more than your one data point. They agree on the theory of gravity for instance. They agree on the human anatomy models. They agree on how math works for their various fields. If you pick up any current field and go to its outer bounds of understanding you are sure to get disagreement for now as data still comes in to support or disprove hypotheses in said fields. Talking about the outer boundaries of climatology like it should be settled science by now is ridiculous. Pretending that scientists are not in general harmony with each other is ridiculous because you’re trying to point at wedges and call them mountains.   Scientists from fields outside of climatology can still use their critical thinking skills to form basic opinions on fields (like climatology) they are not well versed in.   Congress only “answering” to its constituents every 2 or 6 years is a ridiculous statement. They should be answering to them monthly when big events are happening and legislation is getting debated. If congress gave agencies authority to make policy and hired competent agency heads there wouldn’t be a problem. Regulations save lives, regulations keep people employed, regulations keep companies in check. Unelected bureaucrat agency heads are elected through congress. If every government employee needed to be elected by the citizens or congress you’d be essentially asking for more bloated bureaucracy, but you said you don’t want that.   I assume you want a functional government, but the policies you are demanding would make government dysfunctional. Congress would spend all day hiring bureaucrats instead of ever passing laws or running the country further.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-20T02:41:36,1
"Executive branch agency heads are unelected. Every two to six years is infinitely more often than when they face voters. You’re also arguing for their continued ability to unconstitutionally create laws and penalties and against RFK, Jr. doing it.  He should not be able to make these laws just like all the rest. You’re arguing with yourself.   Google [“Sam Brinton”](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sam+Brinton%22) or [“Rachel Levine”](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Rachel+Levine%22) for starters.   The U.S. Constitution and all of its amendments are the final law in this country. They supersede ALL other laws, ordinances, mandates, and any other form of legislation or government policy-making at every government level. There is no special privilege. The imagined part is the authority *anyone* thinks they might have to pass laws that violate the Constitution.   Viruses are incredibly tiny — *all viruses*. COVID viruses are 50-140 nanometers in size while flu viruses are 80-120 nanometers, which falls entirely within the range for COVID. Even if COVID viruses were smaller, they would obviously not be stopped by masks, making that mandate stupid as well as unconstitutional.   97% of scientists do not agree on all theories about climate change. The only climate-related theory that they agreed on in *a single survey* in the 90s is that average global temperatures had raised approximately 1° C since we had started measuring. Furthermore, show me any survey ever where 100% of scientists were polled on any topic.  The 97% was from a select set of names who were sent the survey. 3% still disagreed. Galileo, Newton, Einstein and many others disagreed with conventional science in their times and were proven to be correct. This is how science works. Disagreement is how it advances.   Hit dog vendors and pole dancers might also have critical thinking skills. You do not have to have a degree in any particular field to understand a topic if you have a brain and can read. My point is that the climate has become more a political topic than a scientific one.   Congress wastes an enormous amount of time. They should focus on topics that actually matter and take fewer vacations. Regardless, executive agencies do not have constitutional authority to create laws and penalties. The Constitution is very clear on this topic. Read it. If you don’t like what it says, then try to get it changed, but it is the final authority in law.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-20T10:27:52,1
"Agencies were created by Congress. Congress explicitly gave them the power to use agency expertise to craft policy, and it’s a good system when not abused. Agency heads are elected by congress, specifically the senate, and bad agency heads wouldn’t be a problem if Congress was functioning as intended, instead of the extreme partisanship and wealth accumulation that happens today. When I harp on RFK Jr. it is bc he is a politician and a lawyer, and his anti-science stance shows that he doesn’t understand nor deserve his position at all.   Saying Congress is beholden to voters every 2 or 6 years is infinitely more democratic is pretty close to nonsense. It is more, but once every 365x2 or x6 days is a pathetic comparison. We may have RFK Jr. and Hegseth now, but they will be pushed out sooner than later by mass amounts of citizens decrying their stupidity and incompetency at their jobs. We citizens have no means to kick federal congress members out of their positions if they screw up, only Congress does, and Congress is highly partisan right now.   I clicked your links for Sam Brinton and they are a nuclear engineer, and Rachel Levine has been in the armed services corps a long time and is a pediatrician, so what are you trying to say? Were you trying to highlight that both are queer, and that somehow shows incompetence?   The constitution is the foundation of our laws, but we have a legislature and judicial branches for many reasons. We had a civil war bc of the constitution, bc it wasn’t good enough, bc it allowed slavery, bc it allowed discrimination based on skin color or gender. It’s also why we have amendments to the constitution. I support the constitution but we have more laws today that aren’t in the constitution for multiple reasons.   There are plenty of studies a basic documents out there that show if and how masks protect against covid and other diseases. And just like you complained that the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting sick, you don’t seem to know how vaccines or covid are supposed to work. When a sick person breathes out disease travels out of their body through respiratory fluids, droplets and aerosols. If they are wearing a mask their respirations don’t travel far, and thus there is less likelihood others around them get infected. If others around them also mask (and distance too as is needed) it creates a barrier(s) to entering their bodies too. Vaccines give the immune system the understanding of how to fight a disease. The immune system doesn’t turn on and start fighting the disease till it detects it, so a person is still going to get sick if they breathe in/catch the disease, but they’ll be better able to fight it off. And bc covid was a new disease not many ppl had a chance to build an immunity to it, and so it was easier to have worse symptoms from catching the disease. That’s why masking and distancing and practicing good hand hygiene was important before the vaccine. You’re railing against vaccines and masks out of ignorance and misplaced anger.   I’m not going to respond to your further talk about 97% agreement or Galileo, Einstein, etc. bc you’re trying to make some inane point. Saying science progresses through disagreement is also inane. We could replace disagreement with lots of words, including collaboration, hypotheses, competing hypotheses, work, study, research. So yeah, science can progress through disagreement, but it’s all but a useless truism unless you actually back it up with more information.   The climate becoming more of a political topic than a scientific one is because of politicians not wanting to accept science and scientific facts and theories on the topic. I agree that critical thinking skills can be enough for some stuff, but knowing the lingo of a field, knowing equations of a field, knowing how to read charts thoroughly and correctly or being able to link various information together is more of an expert’s ability than the common laborer’s understanding. We have car mechanics fix cars bc they’ve trained to be experts at it, and we have airplane mechanical engineers determine how to build a more efficient engines bc they’ve trained to work and understand airplane engines. The common laborer probably isn’t keeping up with the latest findings in their hobby interests in the same way an actual physicist does.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-22T23:34:47,1
"The Constitution says:   *All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.*  The agencies we are talking about are in the Executive branch. They can exist, but they cannot create laws or impose penalties. They *can* enforce laws and execute the penalties defined by Congress.  *All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.*  These agencies also cannot impose fees. They can collect fees as designated by Congress.   Last year, SCOTUS reined in the powers of Executive agencies because they have far overstepped their authority. We’ll see how things play out after that decision.   Citizens can kick members of Congress out by voting for someone else. Tell me how citizens can push RFK or Hegseth out. They stay until the President says they are out. It is his sole discretion.   I generally think vaccines are a god thing, COVID vaccines included. However, individuals must be able to decide for themselves. I got COVID early on, so I chose not to get vaxed. I can always reverse that decision if is choose. A close family member died of COVID five weeks after her second booster and she was infected by another vaxed person. We know that the COVID vaccine has killed people. Everyone should gather information and use their judgement to make their own decisions about what goes into their bodies.  You can’t compare cars or aircraft to the universe and the world in which we live. Cars and aircraft are made by men. We understand exactly how they work. Climate has countless variables and we are still learning about it. I’m not arguing climate change one way or the other here. I’m just saying that the science for climate change will most certainly change for such a complex topic that we have only been studying for a few decades. It is not settled.   In the 1970s, scientists predicted a coming ice age. Was it settled then because many scientists agreed on this prediction? We have also been told that we have X number of years before the world becomes uninhabitable. We have passed several of those predicted time periods Temperatures have gone up *and* down during that time. We are still learning and it is good that we continue to study this topic, but it is far from settled.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-23T09:38:22,1

"We know now that the planet generally regurgitates its own CO2 emissions and for that reason our air levels have been around 21% saturation for a while. We know humans emit about 2% of those emissions, but humanity does not have any feedback loops to fully recapture those 2%, and thus we are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. As a layperson I can listen to scientists and data analysts tell me this and understand it without needing to know the whole complexity of the system. The system is more complex, but we know that the environment looks out for itself, and the only things to offset it are volcanic eruptions and meteorite strikes (which we haven’t had in 2-4k years) from nature.   As I said already, citizens uniting in mass and demanding justice is generally the only way right now because Congress is polarized. If they/we organize in mass we can kick bad state politicians out and scare federal politicians to do the right thing, and even if federal politicians refused they couldn’t get any army behind them in the end. So right now mass organizing and protesting.   Federal politicians are also still likely to be pushed to impeach bad agency heads to save themselves, bc they are directly implicit if they do nothing about it. So pressure on politicians put pressure on agency heads.   As we’ve seen with the removal of chevron deferrence, federal agency heads don’t have that ability much anymore. Independent agencies might, but they operate differently.   They are established by Congress through the passage of laws. These laws define the agency's purpose, powers, and structure, often including a degree of independence from presidential control. - taken from ai  The Constitution grants Congress the power to legislate, including the power to create agencies and define their functions. - taken from ai   So the legislative branch is given the authority to do so. I’m not really up for debating this point much more bc we have at least 100 years worth of data and practice having said agencies that it’s pointless to argue that they are unconstitutional.

"The environment does not look out for itself. Equilibrium is reached until a some combination of conditions knocks everything out of balance. Eventually, equilibrium will again be reached and the cycle continues. Yes, this is an oversimplified description, as are all human attempts to try to explain the world and universe in which we live. Again, the complexity is virtually incomprehensible.   What were the CO2 saturations 10,000 or 100,000 or a billion years ago, and at what rate were they changing  during any specific 100 year period?  We simply don’t know.   You said that executive agency heads were more accountable to citizens than members of Congress and now you’re saying that citizens can influence Congress to remove agency heads. That is a contradiction.   You’re still going to have to show me where the Constitution says that Congress has the power to create these agencies. I can’t find it and the document isn’t that long that AI would need to search for it.  Many practices have existed for long periods of time before they were determined to be unconstitutional.   I don’t really have any -isms. Rather, I have many -isms that become effective depending on the situation. The problem with -isms is that they tend to have fluid definitions. Then, once we define them, they tend to define us. A situation will arise and most people will decide how they feel about it and how to act based on the -isms they have chosen for themselves instead of applying logic and reason to each unique situation.  These -isms also tend to conflict with each other.   How do you define your three? I’m not setting a trap. I’m genuinely curious, particularly about feminism and egalitarianism.

"I’ve listened to people I consider experts (they’ve degrees in something that helps them interpret data, while not the one doing the data aggregation - and they do it often enough rather than being a first timer to reading and interpreting studies), so I’m not going to fight you on your belief thar the environment generally doesn’t look after itself. I’d question how it keeps reaching equilibrium if there is no stabilizing elements to the environment. Reaching equilibrium over and over again after a meteor hits, or a volcano goes off, or an earthquake or fire etc. happens seems to indicate that the environment as a mass takes care of itself. After all, the ozone hole fixes/fixes itself after we stopped polluting it so much with ozone-depleting-sprays (CFCs).   A scientist can check some fossils for potential CO2 saturations during xyz times likely by comparing modern life corpses to past corpses, but I’m not a scientist (likely a paleontologist) that does that so I can’t give you a sure fire answer. I don’t say we simply don’t know even though I don’t personally know, because scientists in the specified fields might know, especially considering the theoretical models scientists have for the past.   I said both agency heads and federal congress critters are not directly removeable by citizens, but that citizens in showing their disdain for them through acting congress critters can more likely get them kicked out of their job for not being good at it via impeachment or embarrassment. They can show disdain for federal congress critters but that doesn’t really get them to leave, but it could via embarrassment again. But for both federal congress critters and agency heads impeachment by congress critters is the current way to get rid of federal congress critters or agency heads. - that’s what I remember saying repeatedly.   You’re apparently a constitution expert so if you really think congress doesn’t have the power to create agencies you should go sue them. But it’s happened already so I’m assuming it was found to be within congress’s constitutional power.

"The environment is not conscious. It is a large, complex system of variables. It does not make decisions or take deliberate actions. When one variable changes, physics determines what happens. Throughout the history of the world, CO2 concentrations, global temperatures and many other variables have fluctuated widely and have maintained high or low levels for long periods of time — the length of these periods is not always precisely known. We can see evidence of this in the fossil record. What we can’t see is granular detail as to how long these conditions lasted. The further we go back, the less granular the data becomes.  I never claimed to be an expert of anything, but I can read and I can think. There is nothing in the Constitution that grants Congress this power, nor is there anything that says, “…and whatever else you think you should be able to do.”  Courts have ruled against many things that have been in place for long periods of time (gay marriage, is one recent example) There is no statute of limitations on unconstitutionality. SCOTUS has reversed actions by Congress, the Executive branch and other judges. It has even reversed its own decisions.   I have values, but I don’t define myself with -isms because this limits my ability to reason through specific issues and situations. I believe capitalism is generally a good thing. The world has benefited greatly from people who who are motivated by the accumulation of wealth. However, there can be too much of a good thing. For example, some monopolies have to be regulated or broken up. There are very few absolutes in life. There might be some, but there is almost always some kind of exception to every rule.   Yes, on paper, feminism and egalitarianism seem to be compatible. However, when asked directly, most people who identify themselves as feminists will have an opinion about who gets priority on lifeboats when a ship is sinking. They prefer that men pay for dates and act as protectors. They don’t push for equality when it comes to registering for Selective Service. They want equal representation in politics and white-collar fields, particularly in leadership positions.

At least neither would he if we pay attention to the fact that he was a socialist and civil rights advocate. We can find plenty of individuals on various “ism” sides that “the world benefitted greatly from” so listing some people doesn’t really get anywhere. We can also look at the pitfalls of “isms” like capitalism, which takes away the opportunities for the majority of people by locking it away behind wealth that is stolen and accumulated by the rich, as one example.

Wouldn’t you prefer to not spend money on a date if you could without it saying anything about you?   What if feminists don’t push for being opted in to the selective service because they want to abolish the selective service rather than keep it/expand it? As a feminist I’d rather work to abolish the selective service, which would bring equality to all citizens. This far my vote hasn’t gotten me too far sadly.   Where do you commonly go to listen in on real live feminists talk about such stuff? And if women magically picked up 50% of the labor in these other markets would men pick up 50% of the home and childcare workload? Have men picked up their home slack yet so that women can have an equal chance in the logging industry? Will men be mad if women took 50% of the logging jobs, and thus made men lose 50%~ of their logging jobs? —— my point here is that men generally have repressed women moving in to fields that were previously only men or dominated by men. Workplace harassment is a huge thing that still happens often today.   If I was a 95 year old woman and was asked who should be prioritized for limited lifeboat spots, I would more likely defer my spot to younger generations first. We say women and children first generally because of their potential to carry the species forward. As I am now I’d still defer my position for other women and children first until someone(s) started telling me to also get on…. I just feel like you’re being outraged over a hypothetical that hasn’t happened to you because you’re afraid it might.   Please ping your feminist, egalitarian, and humanist ideals to me and I’ll tell you how ppl of those ideals would likely answer.

"Why is Albert Einstein’s opinion on capitalism relevant?  What are the pitfalls of socialism or communism?  You’re missing the point. I’m saying that feminists who claim to want equality do not really want equality. They do not fight against selective service. They don’t want logging jobs. They only want egalitarianism for the good things and not the bad. When it comes to feminists, none of them claim that men should get half the seats on lifeboats or the equivalent in *any* given situation.    Why are feminists waiting for men to take up the slack before seeking logging jobs, but not executive jobs?  That’s a shit argument. They are not waiting. They only want the egalitarianism when it suits their desires. That *isn’t* egalitarianism. It’s demanding privilege.   A pure capitalist would probably sell seats on lifeboats, but pure capitalists are very rare. Most people who claim to be capitalists also have traditional values including chivalry which would dictate that men give up their seats to women.   If you were a 35 year old woman and 90% of the lifeboat seats were occupied by other women, would you honestly argue that more men should take the remaining seats *plus* the 40% currently occupied by women?  If you would not argue this, you cannot honestly claim to be egalitarian.  The argument about continuation of the species is weak. One man can have more offspring than one woman and he can do it for his entire life. Women have a fertility window about 25-30 years. After about 15 of those years, the odds of a woman carrying a child to term begin to drop. If you’re really making that argument, then females up to age 30 and *all* males should get the lifeboat seats over everyone else.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-30T21:42:04,0
"‘The world has benefitted greatly from people who are motivated by the accumulation of wealth’ - this is why I brought up AE. He also greatly benefitted the world and he didn’t support capitalism as an economic system.   From each according to their ability, to each according to their need - socialism/communism. Pitfalls include overcoming currently built-in greed/selfishness, it allows the disabled and handicap to live well while working less than average, it doesn’t allow people to become unhealthily wealthy, it doesn’t allow for ppl to accumulate mass excessive amounts of material goods, it may limit ppls’ excessive desires. What do you imagine the pitfalls of capitalism are? What do you imagine the pitfalls of socialism/communism are?   Also you said you hold values instead of isms, so what are some of the values?   Do you want a logging job? Do you want to be a farmhand? We have all sorts of jobs for all sorts of people, an egalitarian society doesn’t demand a 50/50 split between men and women, so I don’t understand why you are fuming over the concept.   I told you I’m a feminist so why do you want to insinuate what I’m like? You can ask me. You’re making grandiose claims about feminists in a ridiculously unsupported manner. You’re also arguing against the hypocrisy of hypocrites that are in a movement/religion/organization.   You do know that women can have kids until menopause, which for the average woman in the USA is 51 years, but on average is between the 40s-50s? Your argument at that rate should go up to 40 or menopause. Why do you need so many men saved when it only takes one to run a harem? - this isn’t an argument against men, but questioning faulty logic of how reproduction works.   I’d also ask what happened to the children? Why’d they vanish from your argument about lifeboats?   Capitalists having chivalry… what does chivalry mean to you? Because I’ve read loyalty, honor, and even generosity as chivalrous values. Capitalists toss people away if they aren’t making them money, they screw their workers over by underpaying them severely what they’re worth, and they are stingy with giving away their wealth unless it benefits them.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-30T23:32:45,1
"In capitalism, at a very basic level, one must offer something in order to receive something. If either party finds the deal unacceptable, it does not happen.   A worker and an employer reach an agreement as to what the worker’s labor is worth or there is no deal. A producer and a buyer reach an agreement as to what a product is worth or there is no deal. In other words, I cannot take something from you unless I give you something that you feel is of equal value. Either party is free to compromise and accept something of less value, but it is by choice. That is capitalism in a nutshell.   Some of my fundamental values are honesty, respect for the rights of others, personal responsibility and individual liberty.   I said that the odds of a successful pregnancy start to decrease at around age 30 for the mother. We would want to maximize the chances for continuation of the species. This would mean that women older than around 35 would be suboptimal. Prepubescent males and females can’t reproduce, but they will be able to at some point. One male can run a harem, but does this align with feminist values?  You would also want the gene pool to be as large as possible, so equal numbers of each sex would be optimal.   In any case, this detracts from the original point. Why do women get most, or all of the seats on the lifeboat if egalitarianism is the goal?  Children are either male or female, right?    I don’t want a logging job, so I have never applied for a logging job. Many people do and are happy in that well-paying occupation.  I developed other skills and have a job that I enjoy and that pays the bills.    Let’s back up and start here. From your feminist, egalitarian perspective…  What makes feminism egalitarian?    What are men currently allowed to do that women are not?  Who should get the seats on lifeboats?",thegarymarshall,2025-05-01T14:19:56,1
"Have you negotiated your hourly pay at a fast food restaurant or a big-box store like Walmart, or as a factory floor employee? I know this is personal experience talking, but when the sign on the window/online says hiring at $xx/hr they don’t negotiate. I know there is also no way to negotiate what I pay for a donut or fruit or box of cereal at the grocery store, nor at any restaurant. This idea that everyone can just negotiate is a falsehood.   Your limited lifeboats scenario has nothing to do with feminism, I was/am just willing to talk about it. A emergency/dire situation isn’t a time where philosophy comes to the forefront, and I believe you recognize that. When the titanic was sinking they did not bicker philosophy to decide who would be on lifeboats.   While I’m sure we could work out a consensus on who should be able to get on limited lifeboats, we don’t have to because ships generally carry enough lifeboats to hold up to 125% of capacity, with some limitations applying to older or unique vessels. So this scenario of who gets to ride the lifeboats is kind of stupid. I wish I looked this up before bc it would have given us an easy answer sooner rather than bickering over a moot point. This also goes to show that egalitarianism won out over capitalism after the titanic (maybe not right away, but regulations were eventually put in place). Who should die if the main ship is sinking? No one. No raffling of seats, no leaving men or crew to die, no choosing based off arbitrary reasons.   No deciding to label children as adults with a gender to decide if they have more or less worth.   If you don’t want a logging job, then don’t try to force it upon 50% of women. Forcing a 50/50 job landscape is dumb, and is not egalitarianism.   Social equality for all people, a fundamental worth and moral status for all. This definitely both egalitarianism and feminism. That feminism may try to boost women first is because women historically have been held back. They only received voting rights in the 1900s as an example.   Men can walk around topless and/or barely dressed without getting harassed. Men don’t worry about mansplaining to each other. Men aren’t having their healthcare unfairly controlled by men, aren’t being told they have to carry developing life around inside them. Men aren’t forced to buy feminine hygiene products to account for their bodies’ natural cycles.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-05-02T08:46:12,1
"Any employment candidate can negotiate salary with a business. It’s a choice. If you don’t like the pay, you can ask for more or you can simply not apply for the job. Nobody is being forced to work at any business for any amount of money. It is all 100% consensual. Of course, you are competing with other candidates. If someone else is willing to work at the offered pay, they will get the job.   The lifeboat scenario is just one example of men being benevolent toward women. I’m asking you, as a feminist, what your expectation would be in that situation. Wouldn’t an egalitarian feminist expect equal opportunity between the sexes for lifeboat seats? If not, why not?  This scenario is a simple test of your claimed egalitarianism. If this doesn’t fit your definition of egalitarianism, then what *is* your definition?  I’m not forcing anyone to do anything. Once again, the question about logging job (and many others) is simply a test of your claimed egalitarianism. It is not complicated. If you are demanding equal representation in only select occupations and not others, that’s not very egalitarian. Again, we need to define the term because, the way I see it being applied is not equal.   Most men only gained the right to vote about 50 years before women. Historically, voting wasn’t available to *anyone*. When men did get the right to vote, it was only a small subset of men who met certain qualifications. Furthermore, many women didn’t want the vote and, ultimately, men gave women the right to vote.    Men are not responsible for biology. Nobody is forcing women to be the sex that has menstrual cycles and that carries offspring. That is nature and we have no control over it.",thegarymarshall,2025-05-02T10:56:26,1
"Your first paragraph is theory, real life examples don’t go as you say. It ignores that people cannot sustain themselves without money, so there are ppl forced to do jobs for unfair compensation. We can easily look to restaurant servers that are underpaid while promised tips and average worker wages in countries like China and Mexico as examples of workers getting underpaid. Capitalism is exploitative like that.   The lifeboat example isn’t a men’s benevolence example, the complexity of human emotions helped decide who would get on lifeboats when there weren’t enough, and nowadays there are regulations in place that no one will be left to die over limited lifeboat capacity. Egalitarianism has already solved this issue, whereas capitalism would say excess regulations are stymying competitiveness.   You again don’t seem to understand that egalitarianism isn’t forcing a 50/50 split, it calls for equal right, opportunities, and treatment of people. If women don’t want to take over 50% of every industry they don’t have to. I knew of men’s rights advocates that got angry that women were taking jobs in what used to be originally mens-only workspaces.   What is your understanding and definition of what egalitarianism is?   Before more-all men got a right to vote, men got a right to vote. They may have been rich aristocrats, but they were men. Even when all men got a right to vote women weren’t uplifted until they pushed for more rights.   Men may not be responsible for biology, but we just had an administration and a UK court try to tell people that they can’t change their gender or sex. So conservatives are very much forcing people to be things they don’t want to be. Men may not be responsible for biology, but we’ve had hundreds of anti-trans bills in the USA for multiple years trying to control that. Men were the original lawmakers making laws telling women what they can or can’t wear, what they can or can’t show.  Edit add: “Some of my fundamental values are honesty, respect for the rights of others, personal responsibility and individual liberty.” - can you give your definitions for these 4 values as well.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-05-03T10:17:24,1
"Who is forced to take a particular job at a particular salary?  If you or I accept a job offer at the salary the employer suggests, we are choosing not to negotiate. There are millions of jobs open right now. If you choose to work as a server, knowing in advance what it typically pays, that is entirely by choice.   Are you able to engage in good faith in a question about a hypothetical situation?  The lifeboat scenario is exactly that. It could be a burning building, a natural disaster or any number of things. You don’t like the answer so you try to change the situation.  Just answer in good faith. The fact is that there have been many situations where not everyone can be saved. In the vast majority of these cases, *most* men have voluntarily given their lives to save the lives of women. This has been happening for millennia.  Yes, most men got the right to vote about 50 years before women. Then they used that right to give women the same right. 50 years is very a very short period of time for this to happen. For the vast majority of human history, nobody voted. Incidentally, most women at the time did not want the right to vote.   You can’t change your sex. It’s impossible. That is nature making that “rule”, not men. Even trans activists agree with this. The word gender was synonymous with sex for about 500 years. Before that, it was synonymous with type, class or category.   Honesty:  Telling the truth, not taking something that is not yours without the owner’s permission, not breaking defined rules (cheating) to gain unfair advantage over a competitor.   Rights:  We can do anything we like that does not impede others from enjoying their rights.   Personal responsibility:  We provide for ourselves and our families and take ownership of our actions (accountability). Of course, some people are physically or mentally are incapable of this. There are very few. They rely on the charitable nature of others and most people tend to be charitable when they are given that choice.   Individual liberty: See my definition of right. We have individual rights and can make decisions for ourselves and our families.   My definition of egalitarianism is the equal treatment of people by government and society.  This means that the government should not create any obstacles or burdens on some people and not others. It is *not* guaranteeing equal outcomes for everyone.  We passed egalitarian decades ago and then moved right into the practice of placing burdens on some people, but not others.",thegarymarshall,2025-05-05T09:39:43,1
"Who is forced to take a particular job at a particular salary? The desperate people that need to feed themselves and possibly others, or to keep their shelter/etc.. Those on assistance that are told they must apply for jobs to keep receiving assistance, even if the jobs suck. Those that get kicked out of homes for being different.   Do you really think there are millions of jobs open for the desperate person to apply to that they can actually reach? Are there really millions of jobs for the rural individual that just turned 18 and has no means or money of getting out of their town? Are there really millions of jobs open to the uneducated unskilled individuals - as in can a 18 year old apply for the CEO job or software developer job 200-2000km away, or even the McDonald’s job 25 miles away without a means to get there or appt for said jobs? - my answer is no, it’s not reasonable to proclaim there are millions of actual feasible jobs for people to do that will keep them financially afloat, alive, healthy and happy. Humans don’t have a natural job radar detector either that can find them a truly ideal job, including talking about job search websites and recruiting firms that screw over individuals with their business-friendly work documents (like taking away worker rights to sue a bad employer and instead force the employee into back room arbitration that they can’t control whatsoever).   I’ve shown that your hypothetical situation is pointless on the outset, that the egalitarian or feminist point of view has already won out by making boats have 125% lifeboat capacity. So there’s no reason to argue what my egalitarian or feminist view would decide as it’s already been decided and the only time it is actually tested is when the egalitarian/feminist regulations have been violated and there isn’t enough lifeboat room. Your limited lifeboat situation is not good faith in this regard as it is ignoring the regulations that work to avoid such a situation.   Do please show 25 real life examples where mostly men have given up their lives where passenger lists were evenly split 50/50. This would show that it’s a thing that happens more often than once, that men actually chose to self-sacrifice rather than the captain dictating what happens, and that no women-few women ever chose to self-sacrifice as well. Else you’re just running with a hypothetical situation that doesn’t exist in real life so that you can smear competing views as bad.   In your limited lifeboat situation, since your lifeboats don’t have regulations to save everyone onboard, where a capitalist is selling off lifeboat seats from a few replies earlier, how is it decided who gets seats? How does selling seats interfere with your definition of honesty and rights, personal responsibility and individual liberty? —— I imagine wealth determines seating foremost, I imagine people would sell their freedom/body for a seat if they can’t afford it otherwise, I imagine violence would come from the desperate/poor and violence would be used by the rich to keep them in check, and I imagine those rights definition you speak of, as well as unfair advantages in your honesty definition, would both be violated in this example.   Editted: You’re either ignorant or deceitful when you say no one voted for most of human history. The ancient Greeks had democracy, voting isn’t a new idea from the past 1800-1900s. Men have voted throughout history, or tribal councils, or councils, or kings’ councils. These people voting in the past generally were aristocrats/nobles rather than commoners, and they were generally men. So generally men have been voting a long time, and the commoner finally got fed up and demanded their rights to voting too.   Edit added: There are more ways than on/off voting systems. Going from most restrictive to least restrictive, some examples are autocracy, technocracy, oligarchy, landed voting, wealth voting, census voting, gendered-/-men’s-/-limited suffrage, universal suffrage, and anarchy. Some limited amount of people, usually men and aristocrats/nobles, have got to make group decisions throughout history. Each category can be talked about a bit if it helps to clear up some confusions.  Clown fish are a great example of creatures changing their genotype and phenotype, going from male to female. While humans can’t change their genotypes yet, we can change our phenotypes easily enough, so sex is not immutable.   I’ll do an edit add later, but going to work now before I could say all I wanted to reply to. — still more to say.

"Nobody is born with the skills or knowledge necessary for a high income job. We have to develop those. Until we do that, we work in jobs that pay less. I did it. I also could not sustain myself without money, so I worked multiple jobs while I went to school. Even in those unskilled jobs, I worked hard to make myself more valuable to my employers.  Nobody is being forced to do anything, but *you* want to change that. You want to force employers to pay more. For the sake of argument, let’s say we don that. Where do you think these employers will get the money?    If you were majority shareholder in a company, would you hire an 18 year old to be CEO?  Would you hire a software developer who doesn’t know how to develop software?   Is Ancient Greece most of human history?  No. My statement stands. For most of human history, people, including men and women, had no vote.  Tribal councils and king/queen councils have been largely appointed and didn’t include most members of a given population. Again, most men could not vote until very recently. Once they got that right, they quickly gave it to women, too.   Chivalry has been around for millennia. Men give up seats in trains, open doors for women, walk on the sidewalk closer to traffic and engage in many other chivalrous behaviors, including laying down their lives for women.

"Any job worth doing should provide a livable wage, and while i agree specialized jobs should be paid more, I don't think wages or salaries should outpace each other as they do to the extent they do. In the end the engineer depends as much on the farm hand picking the food and the stocker at the local goods store. Most engineers make more than a livable wage, while low end workers work 40+ hrs, 1-3 jobs, and are living paycheck to paycheck. That's not a long term sustainable system, and we see it in capitalism as every decade or so we go through a recession.   Employers that would pay their employees more wages likely have profits they can draw from, especially because they were before underpaying their employees. Joann Fabrics didn't go under because they didn't pay their employees too much, they went under because private equity bought them out and saddled them with the debt of that buyout. Walmart has had high profits while their workers have been underpaid for decades, with plenty of data to show it. We can look to California and Portland to see that raising wages has put very few industries into financial ruin [https://youtu.be/Sis91xZGeQ8?si=SHTfqT6im1fXjuMH](https://youtu.be/Sis91xZGeQ8?si=SHTfqT6im1fXjuMH) . I'm not going to comment on this topic anymore because I again think you aren't talking in good faith.   Women's suffrage rallies would indicate that women were not just handed the right to vote, they fought for it and some have been fighting for it a long time. I think you simplify and downplay voting rights throughout human history, so I won't elaborate on this topic anymore (not good faith arguments).   Chivalrous knights have murdered countless innocent people since chivalry was common, and the crusades are good examples of ""chivalrous"" men slaughtering innocents in foreign lands. You say what men have done, but men sent Rosa Parks to jail for sitting on a bus, men have kept up the institution of slavery till near modern times and actually still have forms of slavery today, men haven't closed the wage gap between them and women, men are still demanding to use government to control women's and trans folks healthcare choices. Men on average aren't chivalrous, and I don't know why you hold this up when it isn't one of your fundamental values. All the unsolicited dick pics through communication online definitely show that men aren't regulating each other under some ideal banner of chivalry. This whole paragraph about men and chivalry is pathetic baiting.  You said I can't change my sex, that it's impossible, that nature made that rule. But nature has clown fish, and clown fish go from male to female. I listed what genotypes and phenotypes of sex are and how they can be changed, and so how sex can be changed.

"We buy and sell labor like any other product or service. Labor comes in various levels of quality and quantity which together form value. Should a high school kid working 15 hours a week sweeping floors make a livable wage?  What determines the worth of one person’s labor is ultimately what someone else is willing to accept for the same quantity and quality of labor.   This is no different than any other product or service. If someone is selling apples by the side of the road for $3 per pound and you know the next corner has a guy selling the same apples for $2 a pound, are you going to buy from the $3 guy to ensure he makes a livable wage?  Of course not, so why would you expect someone else to do that?  There is nothing bad faith about this. These are just facts. If you educate yourself, work hard and increase your skills, your labor will be worth more than the labor of someone who didn’t. Last I checked, there are 11 million job openings in the U.S. People *can* afford to negotiate unless they have no skills and no education. Nobody is born with these attributes. We all have to make ourselves more valuable.   Most women were against having the right to vote until 1916. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-suffragism) Women have held rallies for many things. That doesn’t force men to do anything they don’t want to do. Most American men in 1920 wanted to give women the right to vote. If they didn’t, it would not have happened. Again, these are facts. Rallies are held to this day. They *might* call attention to an issue, but they don’t force anyone to do anything. Beyond holding rallies, how exactly did women *fight* for the right to vote?  20th century socialists murdered more people than any other group in all of human history. What’s your point?  Men were required by the chivalric code to treat women with honor and respect. Remnants of that can still be seen today, although modern feminism has diminished it greatly. Most men in the western world will hold the door for women or offer their seat in a train. The opposite rarely happens.   Count the men and women on the internet showing us their naked bodies and tell me more about those dick pics. Besides, don’t feminists want to be treated like men?  That would include being crude and obnoxious and many men are to each other. You wouldn’t want to see some of the stuff other men have sent me just to try to be funny.   *Science* has concluded that sex is determined by chromosomes — XX for female and XY for male. We can’t change those. Before you bring up the very rare cases of conditions like hermaphroditism, ask yourself how many legs and fingers humans have. If you say anything but two and ten, science would disagree. Humans have two legs and ten fingers even though, in rare cases, people are born with a different number.   My comments are made in good faith. I am not lying. I am not being insulting. I am not throwing out red herrings to distract from the conversation.

"A high school student should make a livable wage if they choose to work a part-time job during school. The student(s) primary duty is education, and not being poor can help them achieve improved performances if they so choose to work. I’d rather they not work and focus on being a kid and student of course because education is key to a better future. So I’m not enthused when capitalism treats kids as low skill workers that are easily exploitable.   Just like your apple example, even if I guesstimate that gas is always cheaper at that gas station 1/2km further away, it does not mean I will travel an excess 1/2km out of my way to get it. For a pound of apples $3/lb is okay to me. Being stingy over a subjectively fair amount of food seems odd. Paying $4 for a shot of liquor is more likely to activate stinginess in me, specifically because the whole bottle cost $10-30 and they’d get 40 shots out of it.   You again are acting like every single of those 11 million jobs is local for every person, easily achievable. In my city a quick search from LinkedIn says there are 82 open Walmart positions rn, and a state job center says there are 67,000 job openings, another site 92,000 jobs. With unemployment at 3.2% it means there are between 94k-100k laborers trying to find a job. Why aren’t all 11 million jobs at their fingertips? Not having a good job with a livable wage near where you live is a detriment to society and why all jobs should make a livable wage.   Did you even read your Wikipedia article thoroughly? It said more women were organized as “antis” until 1916, not that a majority of women were opposed to women’s suffrage. The article states that at its zenith the women’s suffrage had more than 2 million women supporters, but when the 19th amendment passed it enfranchised 26 million women to vote (and 9.1-11.7 million went on to vote in 1920). That means that more than 2 million were “antis”, but that doesn’t mean 24 million women were “antis”. It is more likely that 12-19 million women didn’t endorse or protest against women’s rights. This is my problem with a lot of what you write, it seems like half-truths when actually looked in to.   Look in the very Wikipedia article you linked to read arguments made for women’s suffrage and how they also used WW1 to push for their rights.  Every century saw more deaths and births as the previous centuries. That’s the pace of human race and technology. The crusades would be a lot bloodier if they had machine guns, the civil war would be a lot bloodier with modern machine guns and tanks and planes, etc. claiming unexpected famines as socialists deaths is also disingenuous. You should cite what you’re trying to claim socialists did, else i could just as easily say it’s not true because you didn’t provide a single piece of evidence to back up your point.   No, women don’t want to be treated like men. Women wanted to be treated as equals, with respect and dignity. You seem to not understand what egalitarianism or feminism means if you equate what you said as equality. Feminists are as appalled by some of the stupid shit men share among themselves. Equality with respect and dignity isn’t a race to the bottom by treating everyone like dispensable trash, it’s a race to the top of a utopian societal ideal.   You frankly don’t know shit/much about science in regards to sex with what you just said. Do you even understand what I meant when I said phenotype and genotype?   How wrong can you be truly about science? Well, you said we humans have 10 fingers. We have 8 fingers and 2 thumbs. You again got most the truth, but not fully.

Quote from that article: *”More American women organized against their own right to vote than in favor of it, until 1916.[1]”*  Can you at least acknowledge that most men voted for women’s suffrage?  Zero women voted for it because they could vote. So, men willingly chose to give women this right.   If feminists want to be treated equally, why do we not see them rushing to get to the door before a man so that they can open it and hold it for him? When I get on a bus or train, why do women not offer me their seat?  Feminists still allow men to do all of these things for them.   Here is one citation regarding socialist/communist murder in the 20th century. There are many more.   https://hawaii.edu/powerkills/COM.ART.HTM  My point is twofold. 1) My claim about chivalrous behavior is specific to the code than men have lived by for millennia. Men have held women in high regard, offering protection and respect. This is true regardless of any bad acts they may have committed. 2) Knights involved in the crusades did kill people. (The reasons for this are an entirely different discussion. The Muslims were certainly not without fault, but for this conversation, we can agree that chivalrous men killed people.) The number of people killed by those men pales in comparison to what the socialists/communists did, yet I doubt you would bring that up in an argument because I’m guessing you generally align with some of their ideologies. This century has not kept pace with the last century for murders. Not even close.   Fine. 8 fingers, two thumbs, two legs, two arms, two hands, two feet and ten toes. My point is that you wouldn’t change the definition based on rare exceptions.   I understand genotypes and phenotypes. Can you tell me what the XX and XY chromosomes represent?  What do those mean in relation to each other?  Do the vast majority of people expressing these two genetic markers exhibit very similar traits. There are rare cases when the genotype and phenotype may not align completely, but we still define them as male and female just as we say humans have two legs, even though rare exceptions exist.   Show me where I have rewritten history. Everything I am saying is demonstrable. Our differences are simply based on how we view the facts. We both have entrenched opinions and we are fortunate to be able to express them freely. Sure, it is unlikely that we will change each other’s mind in any significant way, but there is still value in civil disagreement. We might find common ground or at least learn more about why the other holds a particular opinion.",thegarymarshall,2025-05-08T11:30:02,1
