">The jolt into positive territory was short-lived â€” a spark of hope kindled by a bogus rumor that Trump was weighing a three-month delay on tariffs.      >Once traders realized there was no truth to it, they sold off once again and returned stock tickers to a sea of red.  Get our retirements out of this shit show. A fake X post is responsible for what was a trillion+ dollar recovery. Value is entirely detached from reality.   Even if Trump pauses tariffs for 90 days, he'll do something within a week to send the markets plummeting again.",nerphurp,2025-04-07T17:19:47,1
Part of me wonders if the administration or someone connected to it was shorting the market and betting big on VIX for personal and family gains.  Presidents of the US can't guarantee gains on the stock market. But they can sure as hell guarantee losses with things like tariffs.,muchnycrunchny,2025-04-07T17:21:00,1

"The problem weâ€™re facing now is even *IF* the calvary of reason could get to him, no reasoning will get through.   Weâ€™re dealing with a Narcissist and his ego at this point. All that matters now is that *HE WINS*.   The additional 50% tariffs will be applied.   There is a lunatic at the controls.",Mastiiffmom,2025-04-07T17:49:36,1
The point of these tariffs is to create a situation that will have extreme volatility and can then be used to implement martial law when it inevitably degenerates.  There is no other reason to reject multiple zero for zero offers.  Same with the skewed math of not including services in the trade deficit calculations.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-07T17:41:20,1

Here is how you know your ideas are bad: you never give anyone any warning before they go into effect.  You never give people the opportunity to debate the merits before swan diving into the tower of manure.  Most large scale policies in the past were announced and then given at least a week or more before they were implemented.,DramaticWesley,2025-04-07T19:04:14,1

"I'd argue its not that value is detached from reality (any more than future earnings are inherently) but that this admin is so chaotic and unreliable that such a story gains traction.    the uncertainty is a feature of this admin, and this is just 1 more example of why its so dangerous, policy positions aside.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-07T17:44:47,1

">There is no other reason to reject multiple zero for zero offers.  Yes there is.  Trump made it clear during the general election how he loved the tariffs of the 1890s, and how that was great for America.   Of course he did. That was the time of the robber barons. And they didn't pay income taxes because the federal government was funded by tariffs.  So Trump wants lots of tariff income so he can decrease taxes on the wealthy.",raistlin65,2025-04-07T19:39:30,1

Ya I kind of misread your comment. Still think you shouldnâ€™t just get into shorts because of folks on Reddit. These people are most likely lying.,Weary_Emu3999,2025-04-07T20:16:14,1
