"The headline is incorrect. He is only blocked from deporting them under AEA, not the regular deportation process.",DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-19T12:18:10,159
Is this temporary until they straighten things out in the courts or permanent?,mdws1977,2025-04-19T11:00:57,18
"I'll say it again, hopping a border does not entitle you to 5+ years of ""Due Process."" The SCOTUS interpretation does not factor in the logistical implications of 11 million other cases. The only thing required for a deportation is illegal entry, making the rest of the ""process"" redundant. Trump's attempt to send them to El Salvador is a stretch that's causing a pendulum swing to the Left and he needs to focus on outpacing Obama in quantities of deportations.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-19T11:24:58,11
"ACB has been such a disaster on this issue. Let’s be honest the reason she got so much hype is because they wanted a woman to replace RGB so conservatives could say “see we’re not sexist we chose a woman!!”. She had some flaws at the time that people completely glossed over, and now we’re seeing the consequences   Tbf Republican presidents have an awful track record on SCOTUS justices and she’s probably better than the median one",Jusuf_Nurkic,2025-04-19T14:35:26,-18
"If they’re here illegally, get them out of here. Who care what the courts say. Trump is in charge.",USA_Patriot_100,2025-04-19T22:55:22,-4
This.  Thanks for the clarification.,j3remy2007,2025-04-19T17:29:43,22
"It's technically permanent in the EMS ese that it doesn't have an expiration date. It says he can't remove any until further notice from the Supreme Court. Realistically, the issue is that the alleged TDA members aren't getting enough notice of impending removal and they're not getting any chance to consult with legal representation or contest either the removal in it's entirety or just the claim that they belong to TDA.   IMO it's a coin toss which way this one goes. Trump could broaden his declaration under the AEA to declare an invasion by Venezuelans in general instead of TDA members in particular. That would allow him to expel any Venezuelan under the AEA. Might have some geopolitical consequences though, declaring that another country has invaded you.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T11:18:18,44
"This unsigned order (not even a ruling, technically) isn’t about deportation. It’s about presidential use of the Alien Enemies Act. The fact that the President is using the AEA to deport someone isn’t actually core to the order and nothing in the order prevents the government from conducting deportations.   What’s at issue here is the usage of the AEA to remove people from the country without going through the deportation procedures outlined in the Immigration & Nationality Act.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-19T15:21:08,70
More money printing from citizens' wallets to immigration attorneys. The grift keeps on going. At this point it will have to be declared as an invasion to attempt to undo the harm caused by past administrations. With more than 30 million people in the country that shouldn't be there it is an invasion.,kaytin911,2025-04-19T11:24:18,5
"This shows just how fucked up the government is today.. These people ARE criminals for multiple reasons, one, they're in the country ILLEGALLY, and two, are members of a international gang that commits further crimes, and since they're NOT citizens of the US, they're NOT ENTITLED to Constitutional protections that citizens receive. Trump has invoked the AEA declaring this to be an ENEMY INVASION, and even SCOTUS fucks with Trump and does its best to keep him from doing HIS DUTY AS CinC..",LVDave,2025-04-19T12:34:46,-3
I don’t see why they don’t get military court. The group is designated as a terrorist organization. Have military courts hear the matter and then boot them. Military courts move faster,Omecore65,2025-04-20T02:44:19,-1
"According to the article, Justices Alito and Thomas were the only two dissenting justices in the case. Who would’ve seen that coming? I sure did considering that KJB, Roberts, ACB, Sotomayor, Kavenaugh, Kagan, and Gorsuch have all stopped Trump on key issues in one way or another. Who’d’ve thunk it that the only two originalist justices were the only ones in favor of not shooting this down?",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-19T14:24:38,-11
