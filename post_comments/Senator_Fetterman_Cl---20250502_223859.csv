"“As Fetterman continues to argue, the extremely patient captain adds, “Well, it’s a federal regulation, so if I don’t do it, I can get in trouble, and I don’t want to get in trouble!”  What an absolute tool, he’s a United States Senator arguing about Federal Regulations?!!   Dude is bonafide mental, and a Daddy’s boy who never held a real job.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T00:33:30,40

"They had no problem pushing him out in the public eye and telling everyone he's perfectly fine, just a speech issue..sound familiar? The dude never had time to recover and should have still been in rehab. His wife was as politically ambitious as the party, and still is. Shame on all of them. I worked in a rehab facility and can't believe any dr. would sign off on him returning to the campaign trail. I look for them to try and install his wife. This party is void of hearts & souls!",martel197,2025-05-03T09:36:09,6
"yet, i can still see working with fetterman. i cant with 99.9% of the other dems.  this is a hit piece.  the dems want Fetterman O.U.T. since he doesnt tow the dem line.  he still looks like uncle fester.... but looks significantly better than the rest of the dems.",_Vardos_,2025-05-03T02:27:14,-3
"I mean the alternative was a turd sandwich snake oil salesman , I would have picked the brain injury too.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-03T11:31:11,3
Fetterman has some decent sound bites but his voting record shows he's as left wing as AOC. Don't mistake his public persona for his actual policy positions.,ngoni,2025-05-03T12:46:03,5
"100% this is a well organized effort.   The guy has had some mental health issues, I feel bad for him because he seems to be spiraling. But this plane video happened months ago and now it’s everywhere. Along with the New York magazine piece on how all the “unnamed staffers” tell horror stories about him. And entire article built around anonymous former “staffers” Dems are embracing his downfall I don’t want to talk shit about the guy, mental health is not his fault entirely , he needs to get out of the public eye for awhile",MapleMonstera,2025-05-03T11:30:16,3
They picked a dementia addled president that made Fetterman look lucid right after his stroke and tried to convince us he was sharp as a tack  for 4 yrs😏,martel197,2025-05-03T12:05:06,3
