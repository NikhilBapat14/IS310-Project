A scary thought if this is just the beginning of a  whitewash of our sacred political system. Summer has not even started. The political heat is going to get much worse.,IndependentRegion104,2025-04-30T09:47:53,7
"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:  Let’s take a horrible trip through the last 100 days! DOGE destroyed USAID, leading to widespread devastation and dead children. It may have taken sensitive data from the National Labor Review Board. It’s infiltrated the US Treasury. It’s fired the people working on nukes — then struggled to rehire them; fired the people working on bird flu— then struggled to rehire them; suspended the TSA’s ability to buy food for its bomb-sniffing dogs; and has been dicking around inside the Department of Homeland Security.  The resulting uproar has given Musk cover to eviscerate the agencies that regulate his companies. DOGE targeted the EPA, which had been trying to crack down on Musk’s violations of the Clean Air Act. The NLRB, from which DOGE took data, had said Musk was union-busting. Musk wants to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which would have overseen the digital payment offerings that he wants to bring to X (The Senate is trying to help Musk). NASA is being nudged into assisting SpaceX. The FDA staffers charged with reviewing Neuralink’s devices were fired by DOGE.  Musk has consolidated a great deal of power, a great deal of influence, and a tremendous hold over the government in just three months through DOGE, which is staffed with Musk’s dorky Herrs Knock. It’s stunning.  And yet, it turns out that there’s one thing that can bring these losers to their knees: mockery.
