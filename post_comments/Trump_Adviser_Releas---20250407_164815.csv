The lack of clear goal or purpose with the tariffs is exhausting.  Trump is truly the dumbest person to ever manage to be become president.  Dubya looks like a Rhodes scholar in comparison ,Cactusfan86,2025-04-07T17:09:22,1
There’s not going to be any “meeting the demands” because the point of the tariffs is to weaken the U.S. on the international stage and at home.   This is all for show and to further erode the American international order.,The_Fugue_The,2025-04-07T16:50:55,1

"This is the most economically clueless group of chucklefucks that you could possibly assemble.   First, these tariffs are clearly and obviously based on trade deficits, which are not only not inherently bad but most often very good.   Second, where in the fuck do they think China's manufacturing prowess came from? Here's a hint: they didn't just tool up out of the blue and start competing. Our domestic manufacturers, cheered on by the right, deliberately moved their operations offshore to exploit the cheap wages and pocket more profits. The Republicans proselytized this and went on and on about how this was brilliant and how American consumers would benefit. They, of course, never addressed how this would ultimately affect American workers. Corporate bottom lines were way more important.   Corporations, of course, have no bottom to their greed. They continued the process to the point where they eventually lost control of their entire supply chain. We've seen the results of that even though it's never gotten as bad as it *could* get. They also got stuck when China's standard of living improved to the point that the labor cost difference wasn't big enough to satisfy their greed. Only knowing one game plan, they moved to more impoverished countries like Vietnam, knowing that that would eventually exacerbate their ""problem"" but still only taking a short-term view.   So, here we are. They've lost control of their supply line. They've lost their ability to compete at any significant level. They've lost their ability to boss around their ""underlings"". All of the chickens are coming home to roost, and, in the ultimate display of hubris, believe they can rectify everything by intimidation and fiat. Ain't gonna happen this time, I'm afraid.",barneyrubbble,2025-04-07T17:11:41,1

It has become clear that Trump is pulling a Putin.  Russia had the world convinced that they were a military super power. Then the invaded Ukraine and have been totally thwarted in that effort and lost an unfathomable number of troops and material. The world learned the truth that Russia's military was simply nothing but shadows and lies. (Although with nukes).  Now Trump is doing the same with the US economy. Our standing in the world economy was largely based on inertia. Change is hard and scary so things mostly stayed the same. Now however Trump has forced the point and the world is being forced to make a change and it will leave us behind.  America is in for a rough future. We will no longer be the leader of the world economy and we are not prepared at all for what that means. It is insane that it has been done by choice in just three months of Trump 2: Electric Bogaloo.,MasterK999,2025-04-07T17:57:55,1
"In Australia only about 6% of our exports go to the US so we don't really need to deal with an insane US and cutting off mutual trade will hurt the US more as the US runs a trade surplus with us. However the damage the US is doing to the trading system generally will hurt us indirectly via our major trade partners buying less of our raw materials.  As for what more we can do for free trade with the US I am at a complete loss. The US runs a large trade surplus with us (US exports to Australia $65B, imports from Australia $35B) and we already have a free trade agreement that ensures zero tariffs both ways.  Despite that we got hit with a 10% ""reciprocal"" tariff and now what, we have to start writing protection money cheques?  Trumpian USA is making the Chinese look like fair, reasonable and decent partners. They are also driven by self-interest but at least their actions are rational and predictable.",planck1313,2025-04-07T18:16:40,1

"is it a coup d'etat?     Former Otero County, New Mexico Commissioner Couy Griffin was disqualified from office under the 14th amendment, due to his participation in jan 6th.  He was never charged or convicted of sedition,  only tresspassing.    He attempted  to appeal to the supreme court, which refused to hear the case, suggesting they did not think it had any merits.     On the flip side, SCOTUS ruled not only that Colorado couldn't bar Trump from the primary ballot (despite being adjudicated as having violated the 14th amendment in court), they ruled that the courts could not adjudicate this, only congress (Even though the constitution is quite clear that it requires an act of congress to *remove* the disqualification).
