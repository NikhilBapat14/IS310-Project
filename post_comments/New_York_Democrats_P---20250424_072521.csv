"The problem is not stock sale, the problem is rich people simply use their stock as collateral in bank, and then borrow money and spend it. So they can use their money tax free and no need to pay anything even though their networth is going up at the same time. RIch people don't really sell stock.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T08:00:39,34
"I don’t know how I feel about this one. On the one hand, as a regular Joe, I stay poor for longer. On the other, it’d make NY more independent from the threat of Trump, and would bring in additional monies for the public good.",BigDaddyBain,2025-04-24T07:40:44,4

A minuscule Federal tax on each share of stock sold would be a painless way to start working on our dangerous deficit.,monkeyman1947,2025-04-24T10:25:18,1
how do they pay the money back?,The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-24T08:05:01,4
Hmmm so that’s why it’s a flawed one then.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T08:02:25,1
I feel good about this. High frequency dark pools need to get disincentivized... otherwise the market will continue to keep people like you and me poor while elites get rich off of us.,hendrixski,2025-04-24T08:09:02,6
"Typically they don't, if the bank actually decides call to collect, billionaires/ultra wealthy will open a shell corporation to bail themselves out and ""buy"" the debt from themself.   Banks view ultra rich people safe like how countries (use to) view the USD. Its why so many banks and billionaires fight reform because of the mountains of debt they generate against their stock and literally need that eternal growth model   Edit: clarified that banks dont bail them out but ultra rich bail themselves out",SirBlackselot,2025-04-24T08:10:26,13
"They don't, have you heard of ""too big to fail""? Borrowing money from the bank for rich and poor people is two different things. For poor people they would have to pay back if not their house/car/wage would be taken away. For rich people, because the amount of money is so big, the bank would have to think of ways for you to not go default. Look at Tesla, if Tesla fail, it would become a systemic collapse of the financial system as so many banks were involved and is one of the Mag 7.   So the gov would have to come in and bail them out. We have seen that in 2008. The rich people borrow money, spend them like crazy and keep them; and when system collapsed gov would come in and bail them out. If they win they win, if they lose you would have to pay the price. That's capitalism :)",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T08:54:37,2

"If I understand your point correctly, I agree financial institutions should be disincentivized away from high frequency trades outside of public exchanges like the NYSE, NASDAQ, and the like. My concern would be that the main way for the poor to not be, is primarily through saving. This tax would be similar to a sales tax on goods and services, which we all know disproportionately affects the poor.",BigDaddyBain,2025-04-24T08:40:19,0
"Doesn’t the cap gains on reset once inherited, so they can also then sell tax free to pay back loans as well?  Regardless, the whole fucking loophole should be shut down. Not sure the ramifications, but could make it illegal to use stock as collateral for loans. Then work on the whack-a-mole on how the ultra wealthy work to avoid taxes, instead of bringing back taxes that will more than likely just burden the little guy who can’t afford to move on to a different tax dodge.",JahoclaveS,2025-04-24T09:36:09,4
Oh I see that's interesting. So the bank then has the benefit of using their stock collateral  to invest and make money?,The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-24T08:32:31,3
I think so. I know your right about the reset but im not sure if further loop holes in estate taxes allow them to essentially disappear the loan in its entirety or not.     Yea it should 100% be shut down. I think you would have to first establish a federal program to buy out peoples 401ks and get peoples retirements out of the market (either pension programs or establish a banking service within the USPS or something)  Once you do that you can shut it down completely and stocks would 100% crash but you would have sectioned it off to not hurt peoples retirement,SirBlackselot,2025-04-24T10:26:42,1
Correct. Banks use to have more regulation to reduce them from doing it to much by having a certain amount of assets that can be sold off just in case but Trump reduced that in 2018 (i think it was 2018).  ,SirBlackselot,2025-04-24T10:31:58,3
