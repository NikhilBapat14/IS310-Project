"I don't think anyone disagrees that stopping the war is the ultimate goal. But a peace deal on its own, at least ones that are being discussed are not likely to be accepted or pan out. The way I see it here are my thoughts on the matter.   Peace deal, current territorial gains kept, no additional arms or security guarantee: This gives both sides time to recover and re-arm. This does however greatly favour Russia as while their quality of arms may not be equal to the quality that Ukraine has been getting, even with Europe still supplying Ukraine though not as a whole bloc, Russia will likely still have the industry to re-arm at a faster rate especially if they continue receiving arms from China and North Korea. In addition to this, Putin has repeatedly shown that he is willing to ignore agreed upon treaties such as the Minsk agreement by using a combination of propaganda, misinformation and false flag operations. See, literally any other conflict Russia has started since the cold war. Even if US companies set up mining operations they will likely completely bypass these areas or again use false flags and blame Ukraine for any damage/casualties.   Any other peace deal: Russia will never accept a deal which provides Ukraine with security guarantees from the EU/NATO/US. Nor will either side likely accept loss of territory.   My opinion on the best option: Personally, and I should note I have 0 background in economics or geopolitics, I think the best path to peace is further sanctioning Russia and implementing Tariffs (I know, I know) or sanctions on nations supporting or bypassing sanctions on Russia. This would be done over time to give time to the nations to find other sources for supply like oil.   Negotiate with nations to further undercut Russian prices on resources like oil and gas prior to the above. Lastly, arm Ukraine to the teeth, Supply then with modern arms without restrictions. Russia has stated previously that redlines would lead to military actions on these countries who supplied arms such as f16s, tracks, etc but these have always resulted in nothing. As a safety barrier this can also be done incrementally though it must be at a much faster pace than it is currently. Especially for European nations as it is in their great interest as Russia has historically always been the biggest threat and continues to be. It should also be noted that this can have positive effects for these nations as they get better data on their arms usefulness as well as boosts their economy in the replacement and improvements on these arms.   Again I am no expert, these are my own thoughts and should not be taken at face value. I am not your general and this is not military advice üòÖ.

Obviously, this would make it very easy for Putin to invade again a few years later (or perhaps even a few weeks), destroy more and take more.  You are also ignoring the fact that Russia has held Ukraine for centuries as a colony, and attempted to gradually genocide it away in the process of Russification in order to keep the land, through things like the Holodomor and deportations and by forbidding the Ukrainian language and culture.  The Ukrainian language is now forbidden again in the occupied territories, people and children are being deported to Russia proper, Ukrainian 18 year olds are being recruited by the Russian army to fight against Ukraine, people who resist are arrested and possibly tortured and Russians are encouraged to cheaply buy the houses left behind by refugees.  Do you not care about all of this? And do you also not care that Russia will likely just invade further if the Ukrainian government agrees to a 'peace' now?  How can you claim to argue for the Ukrainian population if you don't know or care about the genocidal acts of Russia against them?

The people of the ussr thought the same about Americans. They can‚Äôt be trusted. It was politics that caused the problem. America was scared of communism. The thought of the rich capitalist people could lose their wealth. Trump and Putin are one of the same. It‚Äôs what they can get for themselves. They now have power and they are not going to give it up.,i-read-it-again,2025-04-26T11:00:34,1
I fear we will have a war in America if Trump tries to take another term. We want fair and honest elections and must be willing to fight for them.  Don't let them take your power!,wisewoman50,2025-04-26T13:32:01,1
