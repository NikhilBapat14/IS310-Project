">The court ruled that the government has to give deportees ""reasonable time"" to challenge their removal in court before leaving the country.   This SCOTUS is corrupt as shit and stacked with traitors, however, let‚Äôs take the tiniest wins where we can get them. They are requiring the detainees to have their day in court.  EDIT: I am not a lawyer and I have no idea what the recourse is if they ignore this part of the ruling. I am just looking for any modicum of good news right now and found this in the article.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-04-07T19:00:27,1

"the governments argument that ""they should absolutely"" receive judicial review is such UTTER FUCKING HORSESHIT when they already sent multiple planeloads out of the fucking country, they've already demonstrated with the Maryland mans case that they are incapable of doing this without administrative mistakes, let alone actual process mistakes, and that they are apparently either incapable or UNWILLING to get them back when they fuck the pooch.  let the administration lock them up if you really don't wanna block the AEA yet, but goddammit, leave the ban on shipping them to a random country they aren't even from until their cases have been heard. are our prisons really so full of holes that these people would escape from them? are our wardens incapable of keeping them from killing other prisoners (because I know that's your next argument)? if so, then our entire prison system is a joke (well, it already is, but for other reasons).  FUCK THIS ADMINISTRATION. FUCK THIS JOKE OF A SUPREME COURT. goddamn.",Red49er,2025-04-07T19:05:49,1

"Although it is vaguely good that they offered some kind of begrudging concession to the principle of due process, I still do not know where exactly I am supposed to *take* these wins.   Am I supposed to offer this win to the judge when they confiscate my birth certificate and try to deport me from the only country I've ever been a citizen of?

"""To the extent that the government removes even one individual without affording him notice and a meaningful opportunity to file and pursue habeas relief, it does so in direct contravention of an edict by the United States Supreme Court""  - From Sotomayor's dissent.   Importantly, however, the government continues to resist returning someone they've already admitted to deporting in error, and it seems this decision was made tonight to upend habeas proceedings ongoing in the District Courts - consideration of a preliminary injunction was to occur at a hearing scheduled for tomorrow the 8th. The government also stated in oral arguments before the DC Circuit Court that it would immediately resume deportations upon removal of the temporary restraining order.  This is going to become an even larger issue. The majority purportedly affirms due process rights for those affected while freeing the government, which not only ignored due process previously, but stated in court it would continue to do so, to resume deportations while simultaneously constraining available remedies.",OldTobyGreen,2025-04-07T20:11:59,1

Sadly I think a big part of it is the conservative snuff film of them being taken off the plane in chains and put in a cell. Works a lot better if they are taken to another country and put in a cell that only has brown people.

You‚Äôre not getting any kind of act of congress like that passed without 60 democratic senators. Abolish the filibuster you‚Äôll say.
