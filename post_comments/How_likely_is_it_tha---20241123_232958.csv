"He is likely to impose tariffs but to what extent is questionable. The president has limits on how he imposes tariffs.   This article explains what powers the president has, what is supposed to go to congress and what he did his first term.   https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-plan-congress/",Alternative_Key_1313,2024-11-25T13:28:13,3
"Well you can look to his first term as a guide: he unilaterally imposed tariffs on about $300~ billion worth of products without pushback. Source: https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/tariffs/  Somewhat mystified by the people that act like Trump’s tariff plan is unknowable and can’t be implemented. He’s already implemented it. You have an entire first term to draw research from! And the evidence bears out that if Trump felt like it, he’d do it. There’s zero indication to think he won’t. ",[deleted],2024-11-28T12:23:40,1

"I think we need to prepare for anything this lunatic does, I truly believe first on his agenda is seeking revenge on the many people he thinks have wronged him.   It is going to be a real Shi\* show.",Billyaustin4407,2024-11-26T16:52:23,2
"> Unlikely. Trump has made clear through statements and past actions that tariffs will only be used as leverage - not economic doctrine. He intends to implement a 10% tariff on China unless they give him assurances that fentanyl manufacturers and smugglers will be dealt with harshly (as in he has asked for death penalty).  It seems kind of convenient conservatives are jumping on [this latest talking point from Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7y52n411o) as a kind of off-ramp for his tariff rhetoric. Previously he's made explicitly [economic justifications](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/tariffs-tax-cuts-core-trumps-economic-pitch-voters-2024-09-24/) for his incredibly broad tariff plans. Its good for the US that even conservatives are starting to acknowledge how disastrous his earlier tariff proposals were but its not as if he's giving us reason to believe he'll be consistent.   >A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico will be imposed if they do not agree to his demands regarding illegal immigration and drugs. Both of these countries will most likely oblige because they do not want a 25% tariff.  We (and I mean the US public, Mexico, China and likely Trump himself) don't even know what those demands look like in reality. Its an amorphous target that could easily be used as a justification for Trump to impose tariffs whenever he wants to.   >What is key to remember is that tariffs are not his economic doctrine - they are a power tool and leverage. In the first trump administration, he used similar methods with no inflationary pressure from tariffs.  >Remember he actually does not want tariffs - he is the one who threw NAFTA and came up with USMCA. That's a good representation of what it actually is.  Again, I sure hope you're right. Relying on the idea that a notoriously capricious man was just lying about his central (only?) economic strategy doesn't really inspire much confidence.   >Trump's nominee for Treasury Sec Scott Bessent has said the President-elect does not intend to implement these tariffs if demands are met  Trump nominated a known [tariff hawk](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/19/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary-trump-pick-00189339) as Commerce secretary (who would actually be implementing his tariff regime). I wouldn't put much stock in what a cabinet nominee is saying he believes Trump thinks, we had more than enough instances of a cabinet member saying ""Trump thinks X"" followed by Trump contradicting them with an announcement that he actually believes Y.",LivefromPhoenix,2024-11-26T12:29:41,0
"It's possible. But we also have good judges. Even Republicans judges, for the most part, would not violate the law that egregiously. Our justice system is designed to withstand political pressure. We have laws, representation and a jury of peers.    If he tried to round up people and put them in jail it would be war. I believe there are enough good people in our justice, law and military that would stand for it.",Alternative_Key_1313,2024-11-26T17:07:56,1
"Yes, people thinking everything is going to be fine are being disingenious. He literally started a trade war with China, where China raised the tariffs on American soy beans and that unfortunately hurt farmers. I just hate people have forgotten what he has done and what his is now capable of with a trifecta.",Anxious_Health1579,2024-11-27T17:31:32,1
Some will be in jail. The worst thing you can do to a lot of them is to cut them and their buddies off from power by firing them . Isolate them. But I predict the useless dei officers will get fired.,Puzzleheaded-Home334,2024-11-29T02:29:00,2
