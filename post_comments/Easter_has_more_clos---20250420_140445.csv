In New Zealand with some exceptions all shops are closed all day Good Friday and Easter Sunday. I'm used to it and it's kind of cool. We're not even a particularly religious country.,genkigirl1974,2025-04-20T16:26:09,7
"I’m seeing a lot of mom n pops opening late, after Easter dinner.   Dammit, it’s the end of Pesach, and I need a glorious chometz laden pizza.   I grew up under blue laws, restricting Sunday trade. So I’m used to waiting.",HippyGrrrl,2025-04-20T16:11:13,2
"A lot of us have been boycotting chickenshit retailers this ""holy-day"" weekend for their DEI abandonment and their newfound Corporate Christian ""values.""  They'll abandon this shit when their sales comps go down the toilet.",YallerDawg,2025-04-20T16:02:54,2

"Ok, I l I've in Kentucky a red state.  I live about 20 minutes from lexington.  On the weekend, sometimes I go to lexington and Door Dash for some extra money.  Lexington has about 300k people and more democrats.  Every year, a few places are closed for Easter.         This year seems like 4 to 5 times as many are closed or have reduced hours coming in late or closing early.  I'm wondering if this the business placating the right or if they are preparing for tarrif.  Basically, are they saying we'll Easter is slow? Let's close early or not open to save money.         I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist.  It just seems weird and don't know where to post this to ask about this.  Also, for some reason, I couldn't figure out how to add this to pist",josduv84,2025-04-20T14:09:53,0

"I'm used to seeing a few mom and pop stores, and a couple of other stores have reduced hours.  But this year, I'm talking some Little Ceasars, Chipotle, save a lot and other major chains.  They are closed for the whole day. Like I said around me, about a third to a fourth of stores have reduced hours or are closed.          I'm 41. I never remember this many stores being closed for Easter.  Someone else mentioned that it could be from protests, maybe.  I have no idea just find it weird.",josduv84,2025-04-20T16:17:34,1
"You might be right.  Some of the stores are major chains.   I've seen some Litte Ceasears, Chipotle, Save a lot and other major chains.  That are closed for the whole day.  Other stores have reduced hours.  Around me, usually a handful of stores close.  This year, a fourth to a third of stores are completely closed or have reduced hours.",josduv84,2025-04-20T16:22:32,0
I live in a red state (yikes) and I thought the same thing today - so many more places closed this year. Sliding into a fundamentalist country.,TurtleDive1234,2025-04-20T20:17:04,4
