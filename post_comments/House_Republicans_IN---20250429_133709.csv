There is no way illegal immigrants cost our country the $80B per year price tag in that bill (maybe $8B per year if that is the 10 year cost).

For example, they use some services like schooling / emergency room, but also provide cheap labor, often pay into social security and medicare with no hope of claiming benefits, may pay taxes and under-utlize other services.  Privatization does not save the government money.   It is always lower quality services for about the same or more money.   The claim that the government is inefficient at spending money in all areas is just a smear campaign by private industry that wants a slice of that guaranteed govt money.",InternetRando12345,2025-04-29T18:41:17,4

You‚Äôre right that it was not covered enough, and a lot of people on the left were frustrated that it was happening (this is where you can realize that just about every Democratic president is not actually on the left, but rather a moderate, or at least would be classified so in any other developed country).   The difference is, under Obama and Biden (and even Bush Jr.) there was at least ostensible due process under the law. The prison system has always been awful, but this president is ramping it up far beyond anything we‚Äôve ever seen before - and he already instituted some truly horrific conditions in the detention centers in his first term. Children held alone, without guardians knowing where they were, without beds or blankets, sent places where their families lost track of them. Anyone remember when Republicans testified in front of Congress during his first term that they were not obligated to provide prisoners with soap and toothpaste, and then a bunch of reporters who had been held by the Taliban or Somali Pirates tweeted out that even their captors gave them toothpaste and soap? Crazy times.   I can only imagine what would happen if this budget passes.  We are already seeing legal residence and US citizens being deported without a trial or any chance to have a lawyer defend them. People are being grabbed off the streets by plain clothes police, disappeared, for all purposes kidnapped- their lawyers and families don‚Äôt even know where they are to contact them. This is not how the government is supposed to operate, this is the definition of tyranny. If you are taken prisoner, the government has a duty to see that you are not abused while in their custody, and that you are able to exercise your rights to legal representation and a trial.   Advocates have been saying this for a long time, but Americans really need to care about what happens to the people deemed  ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù, and most of the public just doesn‚Äôt. They think being ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù means that they don‚Äôt have to care about treating criminals fairly or decently. But that‚Äôs just it - if being accused of being a criminal is enough to make you lose your rights, then all the government has to do is accuse you of being a criminal and you have no chance to defend yourself.",mugsymegasaurus,2025-04-29T22:23:25,7
