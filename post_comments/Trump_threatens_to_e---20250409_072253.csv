"The MAGAt's policies contributed to 400,000 deaths due to COVID during his first term. How many will die due to drug tariffs? How many of your family and friends?",Assine1,2025-04-09T07:29:06,33

"This might be the straw that breaks the camel's back. If people can't get meds and start dying, will they keep supporting this guy?",Rosebunse,2025-04-09T09:47:46,4
He is literally trying to kill Americans. It’s not just people on Social Security who this will affect. There are many people of all ages that are on life-saving drugs like my husband. Or those of us that take drugs for our mental health that they really want to get rid of and not let us take at all. This is going to be far reaching to young and old,Winter_Dragonfly_452,2025-04-09T09:31:34,2
