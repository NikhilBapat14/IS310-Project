"If another country was trying to sabotage America, wouldn't they be doing exactly what the Trump administration is doing?  They would weaken alliances, then crash the stock markets impacting the economy and jobs, place inexperienced leaders in leadership roles to weaken our defenses, and then steal data from citizens while also completely wiping out federal programs that every day Americans are reliant on.  These are all things that any country trying to destroy another country would do.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-30T10:55:18,5

"Could secession be a remedy?   No level of voting out the current administration, legislative and judicial will remove the entrenched mindset that voted for this.  Perhaps they should get their half of middle North American while those who didn’t vote for this and want a competent representative, administrative government get the other half.  Maybe no more United States since we are all that United.  The Billionaires can have the south, including Florida. All jokes aside the country needs to break up into regions.",Robbidarobot,2025-04-30T20:42:15,1
