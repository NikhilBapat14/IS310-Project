Proud to say that no one in my unit, in 3 years, was ever accused to abuse, wrong doing, or violations in my deployments.

Last time I rode Amtrak I had an assigned Business class seat and the entire 3 hour journey no one ever came by to even check my ticket. Zero cares given and great views out the window.,KaleidoscopeNo2435,2025-05-09T23:07:15,14

"Not to be shilling for Amtrak, but if you leave at ~5:00am you can find AMAZING prices. $50 to travel 100s of miles. Amtrak is greatly undervalued imo",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-10T00:32:12,14

"No. The vector is airlines who participate data sharing networks, such as Sabre. The airline pays per flight segment to have their flights listed, which makes the flights easier for consolidators, travel professionals, and other airlines to find. Southwest is the only somewhat major airline I know of that opts out.  Edit: Scratch that. Southwest is a shareholder and has a person on the board of Airlines Reporting Corporation, which is at the center of this investigation. Southwest is also reporting data to the government.",cubert73,2025-05-10T07:32:08,2

"How was it overall? I've always wanted to do a cross-country rail tour, but I'm afraid of the novelty wearing off after the first day. Then you're just fucking stuck on a train lol",BabySuperfreak,2025-05-10T05:11:42,5
I think the bigger question in this situation is how much stuff can you bring for that price? Is it just a carry on and checked luggage like an airline? Or can you bring more for the price? Obviously I'm not talking about moving a whole apartment of stuff but can you pack a few (military size/style) duffel bags and travel with them? Or is it the same as airlines?  If you can travel/move with a few big bags? That would make sense. If you can't and are stuck in a standard seat rather than buying a premium seat? I'd rather fly and get it over with.,themangeraaad,2025-05-10T08:39:26,1
"Ehh. You'd be surprised. If you look at despotic regimes they typically prey on both the top and the bottom. People who make big donations to the opposition, heads of industry that won't pay tribute to the dictator or sacrifice perfomance of their business in the name of his policies, etc. They're all in the crosshairs.",rocc_high_racks,2025-05-10T06:58:28,2
"It will very quickly wear off. Maybe even before the first day is over. Maybe OK if you get a private room, but that's not cheap.",Contunator,2025-05-10T05:56:05,2
"I agree with the parallel comment that the ‚Äútrain experience‚Äù wears off. Sleeping in the seats are a little rough, and the private rooms are expensive and small. If in seats, there are outlets for each row, so if you have a hotspot you can laptop it up. I sometimes travel to other states to participate in bike races, and you can‚Äôt really beat paying ~$50 to travel with your bike 1 or 2 states over. There are really two negatives about Amtrak:  1. In typical American public transportation fashion, some other the cars are not kept clean. One time it smelled like I was sitting in someone else‚Äôs shit for a whole ride. The good thing is you can move to another seat‚Ä¶ as long as there are open seats.  2. The riding experience isn‚Äôt great, but not bad. The seats could be more comfortable, there could be a little more space between people, it could be a better overall experience. With that being said, I travel coach. My view is that trains should be cheaper than airplanes, but if you wanted to get business class or first class those options are there. If you get the first train of the day and you pay ~$50, then there‚Äôs not much you can rightfully complain about.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-10T12:30:53,1
"You‚Äôre allowed two bags up to 50lbs, and a personal item. If you‚Äôre on a train that does checked bags you‚Äôre allowed two more bags up to 50lbs for free, but not all trains have checked bags. Any extra bag is $20, but from my experience from moving to Texas to Michigan by train is when you have to transfer to the train that doesn‚Äôt offer checked baggage, they won‚Äôt charge extra for your carry on bags. Or maybe they didn‚Äôt charge me because they felt bad, because my train was late that I missed my transfer, and they almost lost my bike.",dancinrussians,2025-05-10T10:49:50,1
