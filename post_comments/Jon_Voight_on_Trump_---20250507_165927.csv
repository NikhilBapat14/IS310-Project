"What does Trump know about Hollywood?   Also, anyone want to talk about how many deals this shitstain has all over the world with different countries for his vast business empire? Why isn’t that off limits but he still gets to decide for every other business?  The whole thing is disgusting. I hate that our country fell for this grifting antichrist.",orcinyadders,2025-05-07T17:37:26,3
">Trump said on Truth Social, describing the issue as a “national security threat.”  Everything is a national security threat for this clown. Let's invade British Columbia because the Rockies there are more spectacular for the The Last of Us scenes? Cause yeah, it's prettier in the Canadian Rockies!

"Okay, I can get with you on progressing towards the future.   But drive-in theaters were great and I'd like to see them come back. Especially because it allows the immunocompromised to have some sort of normal theater experience.",Motodoso,2025-05-07T17:29:11,9

"Conservatives want a past that never existed. They want a manufacturing based economy but without the union power of the 1950s. They want the world they think they grew up in, not the one they actually did. It's not even nostalgia, but completely delusional nostalgia.",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-07T18:43:01,5

Totally agree KC has a drive in theater that’s $10 a person for a double feature. I don’t have to worry and the concession is better/cheaper than any AMC.,gibbenskd,2025-05-07T17:41:50,3
