"Eroding trust was what Rump ran on.  Disparaging, criticizing, destabilizing.  Undermining the public’s faith in government institutions is-however, a sword that cuts both ways.",MacRockwell,2025-03-30T14:28:53,22
"They are correct.  We all saw how ICE operates on video- they wear black ski mask over their faces and hide their badges when they approach to kidnap legal residents.  ICE operates outside of the law, and are TERRORISTS on our soil.    So we have every reason to fear that the corruption extends to police who are largely MAGA, and who do a better job protecting Musk property than they do protecting American lives.",Tiny_Structure_7,2025-03-30T16:08:15,18

They kidnapped kids off the street for having bad paperwork the themselves voided without her knowledge.  This is fascist nonsense that must be stopped immediately.  Let’s go back to being America.  Democrats for Social Security.,Necessary-Corner1172,2025-03-31T00:46:36,5
That and killing unarmed Black men for years with little to no accountability…people want to trust…it’s just hard to do when a subset of the public has lived in a fascist police state since…police existed.,SoftwareHot,2025-03-31T02:24:56,5
Boo fucking hoo. Maybe our local police shouldn't have decided to help the Gestapo,Fitz_2112b,2025-03-30T18:14:50,6
I think they are just jealous that they can’t use the same tactics.,johnnyhandbags,2025-03-30T16:29:20,5

"I keep imagining this happening to someone who is packing and trigger happy. From the video, from first contact, it was like 10 seconds before the first guy took his badge out from under his shirt.   More than enough time for someone to think they are about to be kidnapped and react accordingly. Imagine dying because you followed the orders of the Mango Menace.",zeusmeister,2025-03-30T17:56:17,9
