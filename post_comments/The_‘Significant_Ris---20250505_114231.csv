"Russell Berman: “One of President Donald Trump’s greatest political strengths has suddenly become a weakness. He won a second term in large part because voters [believed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546) he could boost the economy. Instead, Trump has [shrunk](https://www.reuters.com/business/stockpiling-ahead-tariffs-likely-hurt-us-economy-first-quarter-2025-04-30/) it, and his tariffs have sent both the stock market and consumer confidence [tumbling](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/economy/us-consumer-confidence-april).  “Republicans in Congress could soon make things much worse. GOP leaders are struggling to reconcile deep divisions as they try to pass Trump’s ‘[one big, beautiful bill,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/21/upshot/house-gop-budget-blueprint.html)’ which encompasses the bulk of his domestic agenda. The plan revolves around his 2017 tax cuts; Republicans want to permanently extend them before they expire at the end of the year, but they can’t agree on how to cover the more than $5 trillion price tag—or whether to cover it at all. The likeliest outcome, analysts say, is a bill that adds trillions to federal deficits, which could cause an already shaky economy to collapse.  “The GOP stands virtually no chance of stabilizing the nation’s finances, the Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin told me. The only question, he said, is ‘how much worse will it be when they’re done?’”  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/MyD61fX1](https://theatln.tc/MyD61fX1)",theatlantic,2025-05-05T11:44:19,18

"The history of the united states government for nearly a hundred years has been conservatives crashing the healthy economies that progressive policy enables, then blaming their own terrible fiscal policies on ""tax and spend"" Democrats.   And, it works. That's the most infuriating part. Being trapped in a country where half the population is seemingly incapable of simple pattern recognition.

"Even if Trump was replaced tomorrow it would not restore trust and confidence in the USA.   He has triggered the beginning of a long overdue cyclic economic recession. Once those gears start to grind then negative growth is inevitable.  The USA falls into recession, on average, every seven years. This impending supply shock and loss of confidence will tip the USA into recession.   The dollar is sinking and the bond market is shaky while he tries to slash corporate taxation.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T05:18:52,1

"The things you describe are not what happens in the book. You are summarizing the book through the lens of your frustration with those that misinterpret the book and claim it as their own, rather than refute their initial premise that it represents them - while saying it doesn’t matter what the book actually says.   The left being repelled by the book is just as annoying and stupid as the rights atttaction to it, especially when I RARELY see anyone who actually shows they’ve read it by doing anything more than making hyperbolic generalizations about entitlement and merit.  ",Pseudoburbia,2025-05-05T17:21:02,1
