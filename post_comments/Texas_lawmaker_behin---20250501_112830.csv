">“Governor Abbott has used this litter box rumor to paint our schools in the worst possible light,” Talarico said. “That's because if you want to defund neighborhood schools across the state, you have to get Texans to turn against their public schools. So you call librarians groomers, you accuse teachers of indoctrination, and now you say that schools are providing litter boxes to students. That's how all of this is tied together.”",GhostFish,2025-05-01T11:55:03,10

"Right like...this is kind of a weird thing to reference but in the late 80s a psychologist made a computer game called Alter Ego, which is basically a choose your own adventure game through a human life meant to show how different choices affect you. It's playable online if anyone is curious. But I bring it up because one of the scenarios I remember from it is when your character is around middle school aged, there's a thing where it's cool for all the kids to wear dog collars to school and have dog names. This is just presented as like a typical adolescent weird trend and I'm sure anyone playing it could relate to those kinds of things happening when they were that age. And I can't stress it enough this was 1986. I know for a fact that there are some very small number of kids wearing cat ears or tails to middle school. They're also doing all sorts of weird shit because they're middle schoolers and that's what they do. They did this stuff when I was a middle schooler and they did this stuff in the 80s and they've always done this stuff. That's just how kids are. One kid will wear cat ears and another kid will try to learn to ride a unicycle it's the correct age for having a silly affectation and doesn't have any deep meaning.",netabareking,2025-05-01T14:31:30,8
