Simply owning and taking any form of personal responsibility will separate a good candidate from the absolute cowards currently running the country.   JB Pritzker is a solid voice among a sea of people who seem to be unable to do find theirs.,citizenjones,2025-05-09T13:21:12,25

"I think taking responsibility may be what voters need to hear. They hate both parties and are just going to keep switching.

"The best part is there is already bad blood between the Orange Menace and the Pritzker family. Summarizing the article over on The Daily Beast (not a fan, but try to stay out of the echo chamber): Sour real estate partnership with JB‚Äôs uncle Jay creating the Grand Hyatt with Drumpf. Mango defaults on his half of the upgrade cost (surprise) and Uncle Jay hold hims accountable. The Orange Menace vows revenge (surprise, surprise).    I‚Äôve been skeptical of Pritzker. However, he seems genuine in his desire to straighten out Illinois finances and not on the backs of taxpayers‚Ä¶ so far. He basically told CPS don‚Äôt look here for money. Same thing to Chicago and Bears when they announced plans to build new stadium: ‚Äúthere is no appetite for this in the state legislature‚Äù.  I‚Äôll take JB over Donnie J (or whichever puppet minion is selected). My only qualm is we‚Äôll lose a reasonable governor and potentially slide back into typical Illinois shenanigans.

It's happening whether you like it or not. Elon Musk spent $250 million to get Trump elected. We need campaign and political finance reform. Pritzker is in favor of reforming campaign finance rules and overturning Citizens United.
