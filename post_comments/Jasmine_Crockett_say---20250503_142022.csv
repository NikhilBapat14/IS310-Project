"Well, to be fair, his mental acuity was already pretty hampered before he even took office in ‘21 so not noticing a drop in his abilities between ‘21 and ‘25 isn’t crazy.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-03T17:13:16,30

"First time I have heard her not lie.   I would be surprised if Biden said Hi to her even once, and she doesn’t have the mental capacity to notice a decline in someone else’s.",MutedSugar3983,2025-05-03T19:55:00,10
"Because she has none herself.   Also, she confused Biden with a house plant. 🪴   “Whachu talkin’ about, wytes! He’s as green as eva!”  *fire alarm chirp*",LemartesIX,2025-05-03T20:27:38,10

That can be a very true statement. It’s always been lacking then she never noticed a drop. It was already bad when she started paying attention. He wasn’t all there before the primaries got into full swing.,jacksonexl,2025-05-03T22:05:40,1
Not a great sign of mental acuity when you can't notice others drop.,RandolphE6,2025-05-03T22:28:39,1
I love when they make statements like this. Just proves they have absolutely zero credibility and their whole schtick is all an act carefully crafted by their handlers.,Anti_Wake,2025-05-04T02:46:12,1

The rest of us sure noticed. Biden during the 2020 debates was a vastly more coherent person than Biden during the 2024 debate. He went from at least being able to recite lines to barely being able to string together a coherent sentence.,the_house_from_up,2025-05-03T23:15:27,8
