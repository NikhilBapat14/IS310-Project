"With all of these ridiculous picks, we have to remember he doesn’t want competence; he wants loyalty. He wants people that will toe the line for team Trump. He doesn’t care if they will do a good job for the American people.   With every action that he takes and every statement that he makes, inside his head he is evaluating two things:   * How does this make me look good?  * How can I make a buck off of this?",transcriptoin_error,2025-05-08T18:19:26,15

"The worker bees at the US attorney's office in DC will be quite effective. The trump admin will be abusing the position to launch investigations into political opposition and the free press, while turning a blind eye to Kremlin activity within the US.  trump is clearly looking for a propagandist to lead this office. To spin whatever nefarious deeds the office is up to. His first nominee, [Ed Martin, is an established propagandist for Russian state media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/16/ed-martin-rt-sputnik-usattorney/).
