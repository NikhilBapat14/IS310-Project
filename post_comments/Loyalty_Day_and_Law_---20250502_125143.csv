Both of these were established in 1958 Â by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  The present occupant of the Oval has walked all over both these days...and stomped them into the ground.,SAJ-13,2025-05-02T13:32:18,11
">For centuries, the world has revered America for its devotion to the timeless principle of equal justice under the law.  Tragically, in recent years, our constitutional heritage faced an existential threat from a political class that abandoned justice in favor of political retribution.  Under the previous administration, Federal law enforcement agencies outrageously allowed violent criminals to roam our streets with impunity while targeting parents, churchgoers, political opponents, and ordinary citizens.  This weaponization of our Government is a threat to our sovereignty and is antithetical to our Nationâ€™s most sacred principles, reminiscent of evil communist regimes.  Stephen Miller needs to go on a long trip to somewhere isolated and far away from Trump.   The hyperbolic bullshit with ""violent criminals to roam our streets"" while Trump himself is a convicted felon is astounding and managed through the election to avoid a trial for Jan 6 shit.    Like this sounds like it's written from a very angst filled teenager who didn't get enough hugs.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-02T13:04:01,8
"> *The rule of law is the capstone of our constitutional order and the crown jewel of the American way of life.*  Except when it doesn't apply to PoopyPants, for one, Matt Gaetz, to pick another at random, or all of the pardonned insurrectionists. Or, of course, when the president doesn't feel like doing what the courts tell him to do.   This whole screed is a blend of four parts fantasy to five parts delusion, all seen through a distorting lens of white male Christo-fascist supremacy.",AINonsense,2025-05-02T13:48:21,6
