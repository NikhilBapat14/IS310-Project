"Ukraine got a pretty good deal. The American law firm that they hired to represent them here turned this from a one sided Trump smash and grab to a functional deal. They’ve already notified congress of an arms transfer exceeding $50m. They don’t have to pay back any retroactive aid. They’re guaranteed to receive defense and industrial support. So instead of the nothing Trump was adamant about giving and “walking away” to abandon them, Ukraine gets much needed equipment and funds for the reconstruction of their country.",Jeansus_,2025-05-01T10:36:17,2
