"The judicial branch has no mechanism to enforce its rulings. However, what is supposed to happen is that the people see that the ruling isn't being enforced and they elect members of Congress and a president who will enforce it and, if possible, impeach the officials who were not enforcing it.",discreetlog,2022-10-09T12:37:42,1
"They don't have any. However, the idea is that the President and Congress, and everybody working for them, will follow their decisions. The Constitution starts to break down if they don't.",avatoin,2022-10-17T14:08:09,1
"This happened- the SC ruled that the Cherokee Indian Tribe couldn't be forcibly removed from Georgia. The state and federal government went ahead and removed them to Oklahoma.   Consequences to anyone involved in doing so? Zero.  The *reason* for paying attention to anything the SC says is that if you don't, the only recourse to resolving disputes is force. So if you don't fancy constant warfare, on average you'll listen to the courts.",[deleted],2022-11-03T08:41:12,1
