Yeah can we stop with the “former bartender” BS. We all know it was her job but she is a force in congress now. I think we get it.,Fartenstein65,2025-05-05T14:47:04,47
"Former bartender is such a shitty headline. She has always been more than just that. I dont see ABC news calling the president a convicted felon on every headline, but a woman in power, her former jobs are always brought up. So misogynistic, honestly.",Tomrepo92,2025-05-05T14:43:57,40
This is so disrespectful to AOC at this point.,saint_trane,2025-05-05T14:31:54,17
"The ""bartender"" thing bothers me, as it's always reported with a negative slant like it's something to look down upon, while the billionaire is a white man that won the birth lottery",sabedo,2025-05-05T14:56:56,7
"Stop with the ""former bartender"" bullshit. What the fuck is wrong with you ABC? Sure you could have said ""Current United States Congresswoman..."" But no. You fucking take it there. Fuck off.",williamgman,2025-05-05T14:45:15,5
Pritzker AOC 2028     AOC John Doe 2036,Early_Gold,2025-05-05T19:14:07,5
It would be a shake-up Democratic ticket.,Kokophelli,2025-05-05T14:29:22,3
"Ah yes another billionaire, exactly what politics needs right now.",ElKidDelPueblo,2025-05-05T14:28:09,5
why are they trying to tie these two together? I think there are other resistance leaders. What about Sanders who toured with her? Awful headline too.,The_Starving_Autist,2025-05-05T14:54:31,3
Dumbest fucking headline.,DatabaseFickle9306,2025-05-05T16:57:53,1
Everyone in this threat caught up on the bartender tag and ignoring the entire article and what AOC is doing.,atreeismissing,2025-05-06T00:11:08,1
"ITT: “sHeS mOrE tHaN a FoRmEr BaRtEnDeR!!!”  Yeah, no shit. That isn’t the fucking point of calling her that in this context.  The entire point is to contrast her with Pritzker’s privileged billions draw attention the fact that the anti-Trump tent is and should be comprised of all different sorts of people.",heeleep,2025-05-05T15:41:29,1
Bernie is one who started it and keeps it going. And has been for 40 years.   So sick of this crap.,shakergeek,2025-05-05T16:22:25,0
billionaires are not the resistance,accidentsneverhappen,2025-05-06T07:53:41,0
Also why is her name second? She has been at the forefront of national politics from her first year… hes done aight by Illinois but all this fresh PR is so suss.,enonmouse,2025-05-05T21:49:09,4
"It's actually a smart move to identify that way. It makes her easy to identify with. ""Former political staffer and economics student"" is too Liberal Elite.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-05T15:02:09,10
It's a positive slant for the most part: it emphasizes that she's no trust fund baby but had to work.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-05T15:02:43,6
Totally. I can imagine what it would be if I went to a conference I was speaking at and the bio & title said former keynote speaker from former k-mart employee and construction worker. Then no mention of the multiple advanced degrees and 30 years of hardcore industry experience.   Journalism is truly dead.,Chainedheat,2025-05-05T18:56:04,1

"Don't sleep on this guy, he'll surprise you. Turned out to be a solid governor who passed a $15/hr minimum wage, legalized pot, and made a lot of progress on the state finances. Then ran a pretty risky campaign to pass a constitutional amendment for progressive income tax reform. Now he's one of the few people with the guts to actually call Trump the dictator he is.  Not what I was expecting, true, but I'll take a win where I can get it.",Xullister,2025-05-05T15:39:40,13
"Sanders is way too old to be considered for future runs. That's why he's not being highlighted, because his chance at the presidency is long past. He's a year older than Biden.",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-05T15:19:27,6
I would put money on the idea that she’s supportive of (if not responsible for) this messaging.,pinkponyclubhouse,2025-05-05T17:56:47,2
>resentment against black people  >3rd time Obama  Please decide if we are racist against black people or not.,explosivepimples,2025-05-05T23:55:46,1
Cool how about we elect someone who isn't a leech on society and also believes those things. No way in hell a billionaire makes that money without exploiting people. We need fundamental changes in the economic system and no billionaire will EVER do that,NenPame,2025-05-05T16:56:48,4
I view being a leader not necessarily the same thing as running for office.,The_Starving_Autist,2025-05-05T15:20:57,2
"I'm no fan of billionaires or oligarchs, but calling this particular dude a leech on society doesn't sit right with me. I've spent decades living under ""pro-business"" politicians like Daley, Madigan, Rauner and Rahm, who literally robbed poor communities to benefit rich patrons, and Pritzker has been a nice change from all that shit.   He doesn't have the background I want, but he's delivering results. Meanwhile the guy with a good progressive pedigree in City Hall is fucking everything up. Take from that what you will. ",Xullister,2025-05-05T18:51:24,5
"He was born into his wealth, he's a part of the Hyatt family. In any event, he's proven that he's the same kind of class traitor FDR was.",UghFudgeBwana,2025-05-05T19:35:24,6
"I've pretty much retired from trying to change anybody's mind about anything, but I will offer up [his Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JB_Pritzker). He's had some fuck-ups, but for someone born into it, he's pretty much the Anti-Trump.",ZombiePartyBoyLives,2025-05-05T19:53:16,5
"Maybe so, but these articles are clearly just trying to start setting up narratives ahead of the next presidential primaries",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-05T16:02:29,2
