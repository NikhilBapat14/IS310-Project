"No, your premise will not bridge the gap.  We need a sort of cultural shift in how we think about wealth and a healthy society.  There are a zillion moving parts and this isn't a place that lends itself to complete discussions.  A place where I kind of start in, though, is with coroporate profit margins.  Pick a company, look at their profit margin, take it down to the lower of either the nearest whole number or .5%, mulitply it by gross revenues, and then pay that amount from the bottom up on their payroll.  That's a little confusing but look at a company like John Deere.  I'm not deep diving on this but the net margin I see is 10.21% on revenues of $8.51B.  Take that down to 10% and you have $17.85M that can be paid to lower level workers.  From the top down, compensation doesn't change and the company is still making 97.94% of its previous profits.  It's a start.  But it's taboo in this world.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-02T19:05:31,25

"If so-called conservatives are going to chase societal conditions of the WWII era, then they should also adopt Ike’s taxation system. People could afford to have children because the marginal tax rates went up to 91% …. So they wanted to have families and it made sense to have families. This is about the time where Americans also were realistically able to create generational wealth. You might have worked in a factory while your husband was at war — he comes back and does a blue collar job….. so that your children can go to college and not have to do back breaking blue collar work the way that you did. College education was still very affordable, as was homeownership — they were not things that would put you into lifelong debt. Having wealth more evenly distributed creates opportunity where there previously was none and fosters innovation. Just look at China — they managed the largest and quickest redistribution of wealth in modern history, lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of extreme poverty in a matter of a couple decades. Their AI tech is miles ahead of ours. Their EVs are waaaay better than ours. Obviously China is not perfect, but they are definitely innovative. Home ownership in Chinese cities is about as expensive as it is in the US, but renting is not outrageous in China. Health care is affordable — not quite fully socialized healthcare, but not overpriced how it is in the US. On the downside, their air quality is horrible from all the industry that’s there. The air quality in US cities is STILL bad — I live in Pittsburgh and back when the steel industry was still here, the city was covered in a black cloud. And it was even worse in the early 1900s when there were still many active coal mines neighboring us. Respiratory and thyroid issues are really common here, even still, because of the air quality. The creek we used to play in when I was a kid has a pipe going straight into it where radioactive waste is dumped. I don’t think people realize what they are asking for when they ask to bring industry back to the US….. expect your private healthcare to cost you even more in premiums with a higher deductible because you’re more exposed and they KNOW it’s a risk. The same way that property insurance KNOWS that climate change is a real threat and it has impacted the type of insurance you’re able to get in certain locations and the cost of that insurance. Further, just because manufacturing jobs *used to be* “good union jobs” doesn’t mean they will in the future. More likely, they’ll be highly automated with AI and robotics, Amazon will hire you to work there for $2 above minimum wage with no benefits or PTO, and when you try to unionize, they’ll call the police to arrest anyone on the picket lines.",CremePsychological77,2025-05-03T00:54:13,1

"It’s been a long time for me, but I worked at an auto assembly plant back in the early 1970s.  Then came the wage/price freeze and gasoline shortages. American automakers were unprepared for the precipitous drop in sales for mid and large cars. The small cars they did make initially sold well until design defects killed them.  The Japanese compact cars were cheap to buy and reliable.  The assembly plant I worked at had massive layoffs then shut down and never reopened.  It is false that American workers didn’t want those jobs. As a young boomer, there was a lot of competition for jobs. That assembly line job I had paid well and the older co workers around me all owned homes. I even had friends who were in college asking me about those jobs, but by the time they were ready to take them, the economy changed overnight.  It’s hard to say if such jobs were unhealthy. Except for the hard cement floors and the heat of the primer area, it wasn’t bad at all. Of course, I was young and fit then.

"I read an interesting article in the Wall St. Journal (around 2010?). It was about a guy who was hired in as the CEO of a mid-size health insurance agency. The company was profitable, but less so than similarly sized companies in the same business. The new guy looked at the bottom line, looked at their fundamentals, and tried to figure where things were sloppy. He noticed that their call centers, the largest body of employees, had a yearly turn over rate of 50%. Instead of delegating or requesting reports, he went and visited a couple of the call centers. He found people who were working multiple jobs to survive, and were eager to get out of such a terrible paying job, as soon as they could. He met an employee of his, a single mother, who was living out of her car to survive.  So he tried a novel approach. He doubled the pay of all call center employees. He paid for those increased salaries by freezing all executive bonuses for 2 years. The employee turnover rate in the call centers evaporated, the employees became much happier, more productive and loyal to their employer. All that, from not rewarding executives for a company's mediocre performance. Profits went up.  A huge part of our income gap in the US, is simply the elites being greedy and assuming that paying themselves more, and everybody else less, is an efficient and stable paradigm. It's not.  But regarding OP's point about repatriating manufacturing; Everything I have read suggests that the US has lost 9-10 jobs to automation, for every job we have lost overseas. If that is anywhere near accurate, than trying to buoy the middle class with new factories is a fools dream. Couple that with the rate AI is growing, and service industry jobs will begin evaporating soon as well. We need to be looking elsewhere to solve our surplus population issues.  ^(Edit: Werdz is hard)",BluesSuedeClues,2025-05-02T19:56:29,22

"Based on your other comment, you aren’t going to like the answer, but government safety nets and government regulation of business are really the only way to combat any of this long term. It will give workers actual protections and options. Unions can do this to a certain extent, but ultimately, if you want a society where part of economic distribution is based on work, government has to be able to force companies to run in certain ways. Or…you can just consider that maybe “work”, as we’ve always known it, shouldn’t dictate one’s ability to live with basic dignity in an economy where many things are automated. But at present, there is an inherent contradiction in a system that wants everyone to work full time and also seeks to minimize costs to businesses (often by cutting jobs and hours).   If you want something more pragmatic and specific to business though, corporate entities need to be held accountable for actually considering all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Most businesses now seem to plan for profit first and then consider everything else. That seems fundamentally backward to most of us. I’m sure we’d all love to think about what fun money we’d like to spend and then pay bills, spend on essentials, etc. This is essentially how many companies seem to run today. But intuitively, most of us know profit should be extra for a job well done, not just something’s shareholders expect regardless of if value is actually created.  Because of this, many companies also have completely unsustainable profit margins. They aren’t investing their workforce and their systems, and as such, companies may achieve cost efficiency, but will still “fail” long term because shareholders want too much. Decades of management science and technology improves have made this scheme possible, but the low hanging fruits are gone and the only major thing left is to cut labor and automate. (Again, this is a bad thing when much of our society runs on the idea that people work for basic things.) Often though, many companies eliminate jobs and just push off additional work on underlings who receive no extra pay.   Beyond that though, corporate executives essentially are rewarded for perpetuating this behavior. Lay off thousands of employees for record earnings and then get fired in a year with a huge golden parachute because they don’t know how to do anything else. Slink off to another corporate board and collect a pay check. These people have no sense of responsibility for the lives and communities that are under their care. They don’t care if a company that has existed for decades or over a century just ceases to exist because shareholders and Wall Street vultures needed a payout. But we let so much of people’s lives be dictated by these people.  There are many more things, but reforming the business culture is largely only going to come from government action. It is the only institution that can match the sizes of these organizations that can now take on governments across the globe.

"The point is that one generation of Americans did work that was hard on their bodies so that they could raise children who wouldn’t have to do the same — they aspired for their children to do white collar work — engineering, finance, medical fields, education, law, government, etc. That is at least a contributing factor in *why* manufacturing got shipped to other countries in the first place. But then college education went from something you could do and pay for while working a part time minimum wage job, to something you have to sign yourself into lifelong debt for. It turns out it’s not what those before us envisioned it would be, but there is no reset button where you can just turn the clock back. Doing tariffs before having the infrastructure serves only to crush small business in favor of mega corporations, because mega corporations are the only ones that can afford to invest in the infrastructure. But even that takes time, and getting everything you need to even set up a facility is going to require importing….. which comes with additional tariffs. Add to that how much technology has advanced and a lot of the manufacturing can be automated and doesn’t create the decent paying union jobs that once were. With the state of AI, robotics, automation, etc., we are going to have to figure out how so many people can earn an income anyway. It doesn’t do us any good to just keep kicking the ball down the road while more and more people get left in the dust. Crushing small business in favor of mega corporations also puts us in the position where it’s highly likely there is another wave of labor rights movements. If you want to create the conditions for Lucy Parsons Pt. 2, by all means. But for being so terrified of communism, the absolute best way to get a strong and thriving communist movement is to swing way too far to the right. And nevermind all that, even the mega corporations might be hesitant to invest in the infrastructure to manufacture in the US, for several reasons — some materials involved in creating the product might not be available in the US anyway; US labor is far more expensive and if they are not well paying jobs with benefits, they may not be able to be filled so easily; the manufacturing process itself might take a specialized type of knowledge where it’s hard to find someone to oversee it in the US; and last but certainly not least, the tariff talk changes from day to day so that business owners cannot reasonably know what to expect and thus cannot sufficiently make smart business choices….. how many will decide it’s not worth the volatility at all?",CremePsychological77,2025-05-03T08:29:04,1

What is “control over our lives”?  Is a government telling all private citizens  that manufacture and sell insulin shots “you cannot charge more than $10 for a month’s worth of shot or you will be imprisoned” exerting “too much control”?  What about from the point of view of diabetics?  Do insulin manufacturers who charge $200 for a month’s worth of shots exert “too much control” over diabetics who are now strongly tied to whichever company has a decent health insurance plan?  Who are much less likely to do stuff like start their own business because they are tied to wherever they can get cheap insulin?

"My understanding was that the high corporate tax rates of 50s-70s encouraged companies to reinvest more in the company (employee pay, assets, R&D, etc.) because they would rather that option than paying that money to the government.  So that wouldn't be seen as heavily in the federal tax receipts that you show in the graph as relatively consistent.  With lower corporate taxes - they can push their pure profit numbers higher since it's not taxed as high, and the profit goes to shareholders/executives and not back into the company/employees.

And that’s not even the only way the government is getting scammed by people with unfathomable amounts of money. When someone can give $45 million a month to a political campaign and then within the first month of that politician taking control, that same donor gets awarded with nearly a billion dollars worth of federal contracts out of the Department of Defense, which is infamous for getting overcharged out the ass and even **still** not being able to pass a single audit….. That was never a donation and was always an investment. He got every dollar back and then some. We are giving welfare to the people who absolutely do not need it, and would not need it for several generations *at least*, while taking welfare away from people who do actually need it. The tax is worth nothing if you’re turning around and getting the money straight back from the government, with 200% interest. I’m sorry, but when you live in a country where 400 people have more money than the remaining hundreds of millions of people combined, there is an issue with the tax system, and it’s not the usual scapegoat — illegal immigrants, who do pay almost $100 billion in taxes (per ITEP estimates) using ITINs. I work in title insurance and I see people with ITINs all the time. That means they have on paper income to be able to qualify for a mortgage, which means they are paying standard payroll taxes on top of their property taxes, while not being able to qualify for the programs they are funding. But there’s always more money to fund the already bloated military budget, never enough money to invest in healthcare, infrastructure, education, or anything that even remotely supports accessibility to the middle class. There is only so much money in circulation. Every time a billionaire’s net worth goes up, that’s more people falling into poverty and lifelong debt and then we wonder why we have a nationwide homelessness crisis. It’s at the point that all the issues snowball into each other, but Americans seem to value getting stomped under the boots they’re licking more than demanding better for all of us.",CremePsychological77,2025-05-03T07:55:30,1
