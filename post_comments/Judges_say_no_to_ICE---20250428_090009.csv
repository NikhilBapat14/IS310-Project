We need more people with this kind of integrity.   Also‚Äîhow embarrassing for those calling her an immigrant when she‚Äôs actually the only one who‚Äôs NOT an immigrant. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,calamitytamer,2025-04-28T10:02:23,156

"Yesterday on ABCs Sunday morning news program, Reince Priebus was saying ""we're not going to let these judges out in the middle of nowhere to overrule the president"".¬†   Pretty elitist comment if you ask me.

"Well this really sucks. As an average employed person in this country it‚Äôs a damn shame when a judge, who went to college, paid their dues, a judge in this country is afraid of losing not only their job but their freedom.
