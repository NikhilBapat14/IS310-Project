Doesn’t sound like either of them regret the guy’s vote even though they have both voiced complaints about how unhinged ICE is under Trump. They’re so close to getting it but not quite. Crazy that they can go through this experience and still not understand.,StormOk7544,2025-04-07T17:55:42,1

">She was released on a $3,000 bond and is awaiting her immigration court date.  Not out of the woods yet.   Digging through the previous stories:  >Still, Bartell stood by his vote for Trump.      >""I knew they were cracking down,"" he said. ""I guess I didn’t know how it was going down.""    >""they know who she is and where she came from,"" he said. ""They need to get the vetting done and not keep these people locked up. It doesn’t make any sense.""  This is becoming common lately; they agree with the policies but aren't happy with the implementation.",nerphurp,2025-04-07T18:04:29,1
"The two most insane parts of all of this is the woman that was deported being understanding about all of this and is another example of Brown people that voted for Trump going along with this bull just to keep their proximity to whiteness. First this:  *Muñoz, who has no criminal record in the U.S. or her home country, still faces an immigration court process related to her visa overstay, separate from the couple's application for her green card, which is under review.*  *She is scheduled to go before an immigration judge in mid-April.*  *""I understand Trump is doing his job as president, and these are the processes,"" she said, ""but the cases should move more quickly if people aren't associated with a gang, or don't have a criminal record.""*  What are you saying? You were detained for over 2 months but you understand he's doing his job as president?!  And then:  ""I understand the government is doing stuff to protect the country,"" Muñoz said. ""But I was thinking, it’s too much.""  Truly scary to have that kind of viewpoint after being deported.",idkbruh653,2025-04-07T18:18:16,1

"Thanks for sharing this because I had meant to check for updates on this case! I'm glad she's free but it's frustrating that these people still don't want to blame trump for what happened. They think he's just unaware of how things are. No, the cruelty is the point.  >She said that now that she is free, she is going to do what she can for those who are still detained, to raise money so they can buy food from the jail commissary, or pay for expensive telephone calls to their families.  Good. I hope she keeps her word and actually does these things. Maybe one day she and her husband will realize that the cruelty is deliberate and not something trump is unaware of -- it's something he wants.",sachiprecious,2025-04-07T18:01:48,1

She's raising money to get food to other detainees (sounds like they don't have much?)  and to get them money to make expensive phone calls (must be a for-profit detention center?)    I wonder if their Maga friends and relatives will donate?,tracyinge,2025-04-07T18:34:08,1

"Great, hope he gets exactly what he voted for. Maybe he can move to Peru when she gets deported.   It says in the article that she overstayed a work study visa five years ago and that she was “unaware” that it would cause problems for her. Girl… come on. I don’t think she should get locked up or deported for that (especially as she’s married to a citizen), and I voted accordingly. Her husband didn’t.
