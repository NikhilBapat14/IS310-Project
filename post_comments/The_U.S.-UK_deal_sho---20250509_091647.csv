The Trump Whitehouse praised this deal with the UK because a market was opened up for American beef and the US was still going to collect billions of dollars in tariffs. For those sitting at the back can I please remind you that the billions of dollars collected in tariffs is being paid by hard working American families and not by UK businesses . It’s a tax grab by Trump on ordinary people.,Shawn_The_Sheep777,2025-05-09T09:34:00,8
"Ha. I saw this on the news yesterday and thought the same.  They're still heavily implying that collecting tariffs is something US citizens should welcome because of all the money it'll generate. Yeah, money they're the ones paying.",Optimism_Deficit,2025-05-09T10:11:45,4
"Exactly, I couldn’t believe what they were saying either. “Yay we’re raising billions in tariffs FROM YOU!!”",Shawn_The_Sheep777,2025-05-09T10:24:12,3
