Remember when Trump was the one saying he was going to ban tik tok?  Pepperidge Farm Remembers.,thepartypantser,2025-05-04T11:09:05,1

So...no deal on tiktok being bought by an American company    Its gonna stay alive through executive orders in perpetuity   But if thats the case why would they even bother actually trying to sell it if they know Trump will keep it alive?,blues111,2025-05-04T11:10:00,1
"Man who won 2024 election in no small part because of misinformation on TikTok doesn't want TikTok banned, shocker ",JWTS6,2025-05-04T11:32:53,1
"Pussyfooting around on this, but supply chain and inventory-decimating tariffs are an all-go. Trump priorities are something. Would banning tiktok create more American factories creating American tiktoks?",localistand,2025-05-04T11:22:19,1

"Dems should lead the charge with a new bill overturning the original "" tik tok ban unless its sold""   You'd either put republicans on notice to have to vote inevitably against it for Trumps sake pissing the youth off or force Trump to give up the leverage while giving dems a win with the youth   Ill be shocked if it does happen though",blues111,2025-05-04T11:13:25,1
It was just so he could control the code. And by he I mean his minions. The algorithm is not the same as it was before.,37853688544788,2025-05-04T12:39:16,1
"> You'd either put republicans on notice to have to vote inevitably against it for Trumps sake pissing the youth off  Why would this piss the youth off against Republicans, when it is the Democrats that are pushing for such a bill? Shouldn't it be turning the youth away from the Democrats?",xibeno9261,2025-05-04T11:26:55,1
Why wouldnt young people be pissed If Republicans voted to affirm the tik tok ban?,blues111,2025-05-04T11:41:40,1
"Because the Democrats are the ones pushing for a ban by introducing such a bill. If the Democrats did nothing, then President Trump could just keep on postponing the ban, so that allows young Americans to continue to use TikTok, while still keeping up the appearance that America is **strong** and not capitulating to China.",xibeno9261,2025-05-04T11:43:27,1
