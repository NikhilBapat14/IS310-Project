No. They're trying to get someone killed. They desperately want a resistance to make an example of someone.,Saul_T_Bauls,2025-05-10T17:42:14,1
"The bottom line in any situation like this is that the street is not the place to adjudicate anything. Determining the lawfulness of the application of law or police authority or the validity of probable cause or the Constitutionality of the actions is only served in a courtroom. The police in question also don’t have the authority to determine these on the scene. If you have a problem with any police action, be the best possible witness and be available to appear in court on their behalf.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-10T16:48:08,1
"This is it in a nutshell.  Trump is upset because they're not removing as many people as he promised, and each ICE office now has a daily quota.  They're not going after criminals at all, they're taking those that are easiest to find, and easiest to apprehend.  Good on the neighbors for forming a human chain, and bad on the local cops for arresting the daughter.  I would have expected better.  I can't believe these ICE apprehensions are legal, Congress needs to step it up.  There was good pushback on Noem in the hearings this week from a couple of the Reps and Senators, but we need more.",Secret_Research_7185,2025-05-10T14:47:12,1

"Whom is it you are scolding?  This is a quote from a woman trying to stop and yelling at the police who are aiding ICE (whatever  ICE means anymore)  “This is ICE. This is federal,” one of the WPD officers explains, as if a suitable explanation. Case closed.  A woman says, “They don’t have a warrant.” Another says, “They’re trying to kidnap someone.”  There are quotes in the headline.  Maybe the headline could be different, but it got my attention because I understood from that it was a panicking bystander, so that would be a subjective choice, but scolding the woman helping is harsh!",benecere,2025-05-10T14:58:52,1
"The problem is Trump can then send them to a prison in another country before anything happens in the courts and then waive responsibility for returning the individual.

"Exactly. My Canadian husband and I were actively in the process of moving to the states, with me sponsoring him for a green card. Those plans have not only halted but reversed and now I'm the one navigating the process of permanent residency in Canada. I had to break the news to my friend who was super excited for us to move closer to her. She was literally like ""they're only going after black and brown people though! he's a white Canadian he'd be fine!"" she's black herself, so this was not a malicious statement it was matter-of-fact. My poor hubs was just like 'even if they're only going after brown people that still just helps cement the fact that this is not a country I want to move to right now.'   But honestly, with respect to the fact that latinos, haitians, muslims, and other minorities are living even more of a nightmare, no immigrant is safe. These people are being heavily incentivized to 'bag and tag' as many immigrants as they can without regard to origin or status. A white Canadian will just fly under the radar longer. All it takes is to make a mistake in the paperwork, or leave the country and come across a crusty CBP officer on the way home. I worry that they will only get more aggressive and efficient in how they target immigrants - I would worry about even getting a traffic ticket or something like that right now if I was an immigrant in the US. If I were a visible minority and an immigrant I would worry about much more than that tbh.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-05-10T16:06:14,1
