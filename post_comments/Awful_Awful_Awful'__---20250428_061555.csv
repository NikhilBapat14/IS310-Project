The economic numbers should scare the GOP to all hell. They have been holding Trump up over the the last decade even through the shit/chaos/fascism.

"The destruction Trump is inflicting on the country is simply beyond what anyone thought he would do.    He is taking a sledgehammer to every sector.    The mass layoffs in the Federal government don’t just affect the people fired, it affects the places they shopped, their families, the meager social safety net.    Then he goes on to destroy businesses with his insane trade policies, trying to take the country back to 1930.   The destruction of science, and research, installing a deranged conspiracy theorist who allows a measles epidemic to flow through the country unabated.    The Pentagon is now led by a cartoon character, and the DOJ would give the old Nazi SS a run for their money.    Farmers are buckling under the dual pressure of tariffs and immigrant workers being deported.   It has only been 100 days, and the destruction Trump has inflicted is simply breathtaking.

"Your logic is completely misguided IMO. Here is the problem. Rural white voters are mostly single issue voters. Abortion. Guns. Jesus. Maybe they've also bought some propaganda about tax cuts and de-regulation, but largely they are locked in with the Republicans on one of the ""single-issues""   Under Clinton, the Democrats thought they could win those voters by moving to the right on tax cuts, strengthening the military, and getting tough on crime, while mainting strong(ish) positions on abortion and gay rights. It largely hasn't worked. When Clinton, Obama, and Biden won elections, they've never once taken a deep red state. They don't even take rural districts in California or New York state.   The national elections have become referendums on ""the economy"", with a few suburban swing districts in a tiny number of swing states deciding the whole election.   And I don't think swing voters are looking for Republican-lite policy on tax cuts and deregulation. Taxing the rich is broadly popular, even with working class Republicans. Medicare For All is broadly popular with all working class people.    The gun rights issue has been ""won"" by the Republicans. There is nothing left for them to fight for, except maybe legalizing fully automatic weapons again. No matter how many school shootings or terror incidents, this issue is basically set. And Democrats have largely abandoned gun control efforts.   Likewise, Republicans have trapped the Democrats into a stalemate at best on abortion for the next 40 years by overturning Roe v Wade. The Democrats could potentially pass a law to protect abortion nationwide, if they held the POTUS, House and Senate, but it would be overturned by SCOTUS or overturned in a few years by the next Republican majority. The Republicans could likewise pass a nationwide abortion ban, but it would likely have disastrous consequences in the next election... if we have any future elections.   Democrats need to offer working class people real solutions and fight for them. Voters don't give a shit about ""reaching across the aisle"", because Republicans NEVER talk about this, and Republicans keep winning elections.   The argument that Democrats need to compromise and move to the center has ALWAYS come from the wealthy donor class. It was never about winning elections.

But the pandemic happened and he did lose.   Thing is, there are other ways to defeat him. His low floor also means we only have to consistently surpass that floor to beat him. If we present a viable alternative, people will take it. If we show respect to voters we lost, voters will come back to us.

It was actually mostly republicans. They were led to believe the charges were made up as a result of the conditioning. Similarly, Trump claimed that the economy was horrible during the election, which led many Republicans to believe it as well, despite evidence showing Biden having a strong economy. Trump and orgs like Fox News has convinced those not to believe what they see with independent evidence.  Trust us is all they ever need.
