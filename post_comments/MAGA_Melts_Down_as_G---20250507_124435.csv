"Tillis' objection is interesting.  He's being villified simply for opposing someone who participated in J6.  That's unfortunate.

"[Ed Martin appeared on Russian state media over 150 times](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/16/ed-martin-rt-sputnik-usattorney/).  Martin's advisor is one of Roger Stone's proteges, Michael Caputo. Caputo is yet another Russian stooge in Agent Krasnov's circle.  >Caputo, who describes Trump’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, as akin to a “big brother” and mentor, has known the president since the 1980s. During that decade, he worked for the DC lobbying firm headed by Stone and Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Caputo’s career also took him abroad. A veteran, Caputo worked for a USAID-funded endeavor that consulted on the election process in Russia in the 1990s. He ended up living in the country and working on public relations for various politicians and businesses in Russia and Ukraine through the early 2000s.  [Newly Minted DOJ Employee Michael Caputo Keeps Posting ‘Antifa’ Death Fantasies Online](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/newly-minted-doj-employee-michael-caputo-keeps-posting-antifa-death-fantasies-online)  Having two Russian stooges run the US Attorney's office in DC would greatly help the Kremlin:  >The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is the largest in the country and has wide jurisdiction to prosecute important national security offenses, former officials said. Its leader should be alert to the threats and risks posed by Russia and other influence operations from overseas, such as the ones the office has prosecuted in recent years involving Russia and other foreign actors, they argued.

"The problem with your analysis is that the 30% that Manchin and Simena voted against essentially gutted the Biden agenda e.g. build back better, the voting act, $15 minimum wage to name but a few. Percentages in and of themselves are pointless",AlwaysAheadOfYou,2025-05-07T13:04:42,16
This is disingenuous.  Sinema and Manchin hamstringed key policy initiatives that were core planks on Biden's agenda. Tillis isnt approving one Trump nominee. The disproportionate response for anything other than sycophancy compared with liberal fury at Democrats who scuttled key portions of the president agenda is an unfair equivalence.,Pike_Gordon,2025-05-07T13:51:58,6
