"You are getting downvoted because your comment somewhat doesn’t understand the picture. Powell said that if Trump wants lower rates, he “needs to be clear where he wants to end up.” Which means that if he wants lower rates, Trump needs to stop being inconsistent about tariffs, have clear objectives/planning, tariff levels/limits, and more consistency (less erratic) so that the Fed can model the tariff effects on inflation and the economy to make cut decisions.",Aeternitas,2025-04-21T08:48:49,187
"There is no reason to cut rates now.  Tariffs objectively will create increased inflation, so decreasing rates now will stoke inflation higher.  This increases costs for all of us.  Why are you so eager for inflation to increase?",SetOk6462,2025-04-21T07:13:19,175
"Dare I say, a rate cut in December was of no help to the Dems....as the election was early November.  Given the inevitability of the tariffs *just enacted* to foster a bout of inflation for American consumers....I think the Fed's prudence on rate cuts is certainly understandable. What's also understandable is the Trump Administration's concerns regarding a potential recession. The Fed has to maintain a delicate balancing act.  One thing is certain: Inflation must remain the number one concern for Fed policy-makers. Unemployment may be devastating to those who lose their jobs, but the number of unemployed compared to the total work-force is and will remain comparatively small. Conversely, inflation hurts *everyone*....except the very rich, who can obviously afford price increases.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-21T06:18:26,133
"Your post was obviously brigaded. The top commenter here, Aeternitas is a brigade denier, or maybe even complicit, given how he behaved when confronted about it. It's beyond laughable to deny it. ",According-Activity87,2025-04-22T09:11:23,2
At least before June because we have to refi 6.5 trillion of our debt then. Another 3.5 trillion later in the year,Nectarine-Fast,2025-04-21T07:25:55,0
China is a mess and I don't think they can dig out of it. They desperately need American markets and they have been jerking us around for years. Their pride will be their downfall. I think a rate decrease can wait a month,AppState1981,2025-04-21T06:16:36,-4

"The s&p went up 2.4% after rate cuts in 2024 and as i noted inflation is lower than it was then. On top of that, the US is supposed to refinance debt this year.",Fishingforyams,2025-04-21T07:36:12,-36
">  Tariffs objectively will create increased inflation,  Tariffs (like taxes) pull dollars away from the money supply.  That's not inflationary.  It's deflationary.  edit: Inflation is not merely rising prices.  It's ""too many dollars chasing too few products"".  When tariffs or taxes siphon money out of the money supply, where it's captured back by government, then that money leaves the system, unless government increases spending to offset it.  That's why *inflation* does not apply.",ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-21T17:27:24,-6
"Tariffs aren't ""*make everything more expensive for no reason*"" the whole point of a rate hike was to increase government funds... but that's what tariffs also do... A 0.25% decrease wouldn't end the world and Trump's made it clear they don't need the money from the rates.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-21T08:02:38,-27

i love how they think it's convincing to throw their fellow conservative mask on and post here.  You would think they'd have something better to do then argue with people who have no interest in their opinions.,Fishingforyams,2025-04-22T10:01:43,2

"Cutting rates won’t necessarily reduce the long end of the curve.  The economic turbulence caused has spiked the longer end, which can outweigh downward pressure from rate cuts.  10 year is used as the benchmark.",SetOk6462,2025-04-21T07:42:13,76

"You have to remember, they are immoral. They don't care about honestly or integrity, they just seek to manipulate because they don't have true core principles. It's a constant grift with them, it never stops. They want everyone to believe that their values, their positions, and ultimately they themselves are more popular/influencial than they truly are. It stems from deep seeded insecurity because deep down they know they are as ridiculous as they appear to be to rational/sane people. ",According-Activity87,2025-04-22T16:40:37,2

"If demand decreases at the same time, which has already been happening, it can force it back upward.   There’s a reason it has spiked in the last two weeks absent an increase in rates.

"Both of you are wrong. You, for behaving as if the OP's comment about the source of his downvotes is baseless, which it obviously is not. Him, for believing that just because the liberals who brigade this place target and downvote a post, it automatically makes its content correct. I'm not challenging your conservatism; that's just you being clueless again. I'm clearly stating that many of the people following this heavily downvoted, practically dead, thread aren't. It's like you live in a fantasy world, ignorant of what's going on in both Reddit and this sub on the regular. Going on about people being 'non-technical' and your conservative beliefs just makes you seem like a total clown in the context of this discussion.  Edit: Once cornered, Aternitas here dropped the last reply below and blocked me before I could respond pretty much proving he was never commenting here in good faith. 🤡",According-Activity87,2025-04-22T08:08:06,0
