"From CBS news: > ""Cardinal George of Chicago, of happy memory, was one of my great mentors, and he said: 'Look, until America goes into political decline, there won't be an American pope.' And his point was, if America is kind of running the world politically, culturally, economically, they don't want America running the world religiously. So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.""",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-08T12:59:00,16

"From Bloomberg News reporter [Skylar Woodhouse](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUy6Fmtwevw/skylar-woodhouse):  President Donald Trump hailed the election of Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost as the pope, the first US national ever to be head of the Catholic Church, and said he looked forward to meeting him.  “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country,” Trump said in a social media post on Thursday. “I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”  Prevost, who will go by the name of Leo XIV, is seen by Vatican watchers as someone who could have a good rapport with Trump, but who may also clash with the president over migration. Prevost, 69, was born in Chicago but spent much of his life outside the US, mostly in Peru and Rome.",bloomberg,2025-05-08T12:42:52,3

This is the closest way to make Trump pope.  It was impossible for Trump to be pope so they selected the cardinal that lives closest to Trump.  The Church is now an extension of the United States.,dbag3o1,2025-05-08T12:45:15,-5

"While I won’t deny Americans are wildly egotistical, I cannot recall a time I have ever heard anyone say “American” and meant someone hailing from either of the continents of North and South America. There is one COUNTRY with that name.  By that logic, every other language that refers to us as “The United States” (Les Étas-Unis par example) would be crediting us with being the single entity of united states in the world.  edit: ….. and actually, said languages still refer to us as Americans.",BerrySundae,2025-05-08T13:01:52,4
"Yeah - I really can't recall someone saying they are american just because they are from the western hemisphere. Most people will refer to their nation. One would think maybe they would say North American or South American, if they want to be more broad. Plus 'American' is just shorthand for a US of A citizen, I'd use a different one if it existed. What else are supposed to say -  'USAian'?  This is just one of those items that feels petty. Like the soccer-football thing. Or the multi-generational. ethnic heritage we cling onto (Mexican-American, Irish-American etc) that they don't understand.
