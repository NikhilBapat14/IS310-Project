"So even more ""weaponizing the government""?? It was always projection and a confession. Fuck these people.",MoveMitchGetOutDaWay,2025-05-03T02:33:44,66
"You can [see the letter here](https://x.com/_Eric_Reinhart/status/1912958244768690407).  Lots of vague noises about ""competing viewpoints"". Is that flat earth, antivaxx, creationism, climate science denial, or all of the above?",DaveChild,2025-05-03T02:51:41,47
"It’s incredible to me the typos and errors in official letters people post or I receive at work.  If the one posted here is real, you sound much less threatening with these kinds of errors in it.  The last paragraph:  “I look forward to I look forward to and appreciate your cooperation with my letter of inquiry after request.”  Maybe proofread your shakedown documents before sending them out.  This ain’t Reddit.",Calix19,2025-05-03T03:13:25,18
" Incredible. Science in the USA is in serious trouble.   Also, they should send the same letter to Fox news !",mwanafunzi255,2025-05-03T02:55:15,8
Nazis be Nazi-ing.,Ohforgawdamnfucksake,2025-05-03T04:44:36,8
I’m sure it has something to do with abortion as well.,mfeldmannRNE,2025-05-03T05:06:00,4
They want to speedrun the scientific décliné of Nazi Germany and Lyssenkoist USSR?,Johannes_P,2025-05-03T04:20:16,3
"They are doubly looking forward to hearing back. What idiots wrote this letter, proofread it or decided it was good to send out?",Alstar45,2025-05-03T06:49:08,2
"Thankfully, journals can simply ignore this",AcadiaLivid2582,2025-05-03T07:09:59,2
"Have you considered that if fascists don't like what you say it can't be science? This was proven in WW2 when the Nazis rejected Einstein's ideas or other physicists as Jewish science, a decision that in no way bit them or their allies in the ass at all. /s",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-03T03:13:34,30
"Considering it's a medical journal creationism, climate change and flat earth seem unlikely. Probably anti-vax and transphobic crap is why they sent this. Though wouldn't be surprised if homophobia factored in as well.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-03T03:10:04,23
Vaccine and transgender studies are likely the main targets.,InsideAside885,2025-05-03T03:22:04,4
Let’s bring back child sacrifice to appease the health gods.,jimmygee2,2025-05-03T04:55:47,2
I've seen a few of his other letters.  They're even worse than this one.  He makes Trump look like Shakespeare.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-03T06:39:20,8
Oh I was thinking back to where I saw this before. And I was reading a chatgpt generated script for a sales email and this was the exact typo there as well. Might be coincidence… but I wouldn’t put it past these idiots,quickjackrabbit,2025-05-03T08:44:05,3
"They want everyone and everything to bend to their political will, even things that won’t such as actual science and reality.",Quietkitsune,2025-05-03T09:33:41,3
The MAGA cult isnt well known for their intelligence. I remember someone evaluating Trump and estimating he only has a 4th grade language comprehension level.,InsideAside885,2025-05-03T11:54:15,2
They want weird things like conversion therapy to be respected. And some radicals even want to end all psychiatric medication claiming Big Pharma conspiracies.  Tennessee is passing a bill that would demand research into whether psychiatric medication is what's causing mass shootings. That's the kind of medical studies they want.,InsideAside885,2025-05-03T03:35:17,15
"Well, flat earth belief is a mental health issue, and climate change is causing all sorts of health problems, so those are probably also targets.",GF_baker_2024,2025-05-03T06:53:46,2
"Of course, they're so narcissist that they're into Solipsism.",Johannes_P,2025-05-03T14:57:33,2
"Yes, the kind where they shift all the blame of society's ills onto a group they can demonize. Not surprised the rapid uptick in hate towards mental illness we're seeing now as this was a common tactic used in Stalin's regime to lock up dissenters.  Since mental illness can be invisible, could happen to anyone and is so poorly understood by the public it's the perfect cudgel to beat all of society into submission with. Anyone can be accused of being mentally ill and can be sent off to camps to instill fear, force compliance and quiet dissent.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-03T03:40:42,10
"Not only that, if you are deemed mentally ill you could lose the right to own a gun and vote.",Gr8NonSequitur,2025-05-03T08:08:45,3
"Yup, which is why it's so valuable to authoritarians..",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-04T23:06:59,1
