Isn't JD Vance a tech millionaire or something?  Are you telling me he couldn't cough up the money to get her private insurance?    She could have paid him back by watching his kids as grandparents and uncles are supposed to do.,Opposite_Community11,2025-04-07T23:03:27,107

"For decades now Republicans _gladly_ tout programs of Democrats that they themselves vociferously opposed and usually still actively work to eliminate.  Again, they’ve been doing it for decades, nigh on a century. It’s the kind of thing an effective press corps would have stopped ages ago.",Timothy303,2025-04-08T02:34:24,3

"From Wikipedia   Vance was born James Donald Bowman on August 2, 1984, in Middletown, Ohio,[2][3] to Beverly Carol (née Vance) and Donald Ray Bowman. He is of Scots-Irish descent[4] and Appalachian American ancestry, spending time in his youth living with family in Jackson, Kentucky.[5][6] His parents divorced when he was a toddler.[3] After Bowman was adopted by his mother's third husband, Bob Hamel, his mother changed his name to James David Hamel to remove his father's first name and surname and to preserve an uncle's first name, David. Vance therefore kept his nickname, JD.[7][8][9]",Late-Rutabaga6238,2025-04-08T04:43:03,9
