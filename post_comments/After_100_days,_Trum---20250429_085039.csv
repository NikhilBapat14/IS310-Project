"Note how all the checks and balances fail to work.  Emoluments Clause completely ignored, blatant corruption with multiple avenues to funnel bribes into Trump’s pockets.  Politically motivated targeting of perceived adversaries using the DOJ.  Blatant disregard for any regulations regarding document retention or use of classified channels.  Evading court orders, and yet no repercussions.  Our system is failing.",KidKilobyte,2025-04-29T09:13:52,11
"Some have already been far more adversely impacted than others \[entire cities and states\], but by the time 2028 comes around, this will feel like a different country altogether and not in a good way. We will become more isolated globally, more divided and poorer and left with a country without the traditional checks and balances.     >It is less a new administration than what appears to be a new regime. ",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-29T08:59:32,9

"Of course it's a vengeful monarchy. And it's victims are the USA people. But when some one promises the world and play on people's fear, etc. You don't really notice what really is happening.",mickyfox0,2025-04-30T01:22:00,1
