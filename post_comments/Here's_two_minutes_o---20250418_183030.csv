"He is so passionate about this.  “His heart is reserved for any illegal alien who’s a member of a foreign terrorist organization. I am beyond appalled.”  “I’m almost lost for words how outrageous it is. Here’s the individual, the man who has been deported to his home country of El Salvador, who has been repeatedly documented by multiple federal and state authorities to be a member of MS-13, one of the most violent and ruthless criminal organizations on planet Earth, which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization, an individual who has been incredibly implicated in human smuggling and human trafficking, an individual  who is a documented woman beater, somebody who viciously assaulted a woman in ways that shock the human conscience.”  “*THAT* is who the Democrat Party is going to provide aid, solace, and comfort to, not to Senator Van Hollen’s own constituents like the Morin family.”  “Rachel Morin was viciously beaten, brutally r*ped and m*rdered.  And her mother never even got a phone call  from Senator Van Hollen... or Kayla Hamilton  a young girl who was attacked in a public restaurant, r*ped in the bathroom and beaten to d*ath and m*rdered by an illegal alien that Joe Biden set free into the country.  None of those people elicit human sympathy from Senator Van Hollen.”  “How broken is that man’s heart? How broken is his conscience, that he doesn’t have even an ounce of empathy  or time or concern to share with those families, or how many of his citizen constituents have been k*lled by the fentanyl that Joe Biden allowed into this country by the cartels that made a fortune off of human trafficking smuggling into this country... or the children in his state that cannot even get a good education or good health care because of the mass migration that has occurred into his state.”",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-19T00:00:17,23
The second video at the bottom where he explains the difference between a deportation order and a withholding order is even better than the first one. Damn our media is stupid.,Macien4321,2025-04-18T19:38:35,28
"These are great videos!  the way it is edited, it sounds like there was a deportation order?  I have the temporary withholding order, but it doesn’t order him out like Miller is saying.  But I can’t find an actual judge issued deportation order?  I also get the argument he’s making that being a foreign terrorist voids the temporary withholding… I’m just trying to find, was there an actual deportation order, or just the one Trump gave generally?  Or did Miller misspeak?",j3remy2007,2025-04-18T22:12:15,5
