"A new report is confirming what President Donald Trump has stated for months: the Venezuelan government is weaponizing criminal gangs and sending foreign terrorists into the U.S. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessment shared with Fox News, Venezuela’s socialist president Nicolás Maduro and his deputies are using criminals from the Tren de Aragua (TdA) transnational gang as “proxies” to “destabilize” foreign nations, including Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and the U.S. The FBI anticipates that TdA members the Venezuelan government has sent to the U.S. will, within the next six to 18 months, begin targeting and killing other Venezuelan nationals who have been opponents or critics of Maduro’s administration.  Pete over at DOD needs to take a look at this and Maduro. If Maduro wishes to mess with the USA, the DOD can engage and address Venezuela in about 15 days!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T18:50:31,56
"Given this information, AEA should be applied to all Venezuelan nationals, not just known/suspected TdA gang members.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-25T19:31:41,7
