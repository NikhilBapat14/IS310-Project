> For that trade we could have elected Democrats.   Follow the sign that says “fuck off” WSJ.  That’s a pathetic disingenuous argument. They know full everything else Trump is doing is building for a synergy of destruction.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-08T08:02:48,83
"However, he is perfectly fine with paying 100 million dollars for a military parade for his birthday.   Healthcare for millions of people is not high on his list.",SAJ-13,2025-05-08T08:10:49,56
>Trump officials want Medicaid to pay drug makers “the lowest price charged by other developed countries”        The Journal thinks this is a bad idea. I disagree.,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-08T08:54:40,27
"Trump used to have the support of both the rapacious, greedy, screw everyone else, wing of the Republican Party, and the support of his deluded cult members. Now he’s only got the cult members.",ddr1ver,2025-05-08T08:20:36,7
"This is almost good. Like, if we were all on taxpayer paid-for medicaid, medicaid getting guaranteed low prices would mean medicine would be free for all Americans.",NolChannel,2025-05-08T08:26:53,5
"Lol, the only good idea he may ever have in his fucking life and THAT is what makes them acknowledge that the tarrifs are a stupid idea? Fuck you, WSJ, your oligarch boot-licking is fucking pathetic.    Genuinely, the ONLY pro-consumer idea to ever enter Donnys head, the only time his schoolyard bully understanding of ""fairness"" actually registers an instance of unfair trade occuring, and THAT is the moment media like WSJ sudden sound the alarms that Donny is a fucking dunce?",LordIndica,2025-05-08T10:02:05,17
It’s the only good idea he has had.,turb0_encapsulator,2025-05-08T09:22:19,5
They’re upset because Trump isn’t being evil enough for them.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-08T08:03:34,7
"This is actually a great idea, and I hate Trump.  Why in the hell should Americans be footing the entire bill for drug companies' R&D costs?  Spread it out across all nations so we stop getting screwed for once.    I never thought I'd say this in my life, but, good job Trump.  At least, until he changes his mind on this LOL",javyn1,2025-05-08T12:10:17,4

He says it's for Flag Day and that it's a coincidence that it's his birthday. Sure Donnie. Sure.,PM_THE_REAPER,2025-05-08T08:13:45,21
"I am genuinely unsure how to feel about this. Couldn’t this cause problems for our drug supply, and specifically for those at the bottom on Medicaid? I could see a situation where people who can afford it or have access to private insurance can just buy drugs but those on Medicaid literally cannot due to a shortage of drugs willing to be sold at those prices.  Strong controls like this might work if MOST Americans were on public healthcare, but in the absence of that doesn’t this just speed along complete privatization?",BerrySundae,2025-05-08T13:55:43,4
But his cult is now the mainstream of the party. ,icanswimforever,2025-05-08T10:55:00,7
"Not those with employer sponsored health plans like UHC- they’ll pass the costs on to their customers. Universal healthcare is the only way, but that’s like asking for Congress to ban themselves from individual stock trades.",yomamma_75,2025-05-08T08:56:56,7

"Yeah and when you complain about it, he will say the Left hates America and the Military. Same when we complain about kidnapping folks without Due Process. Suddenly we are all pro criminal lol. Always bad faith arguments",SeanOfTheDead1313,2025-05-08T12:19:03,1
