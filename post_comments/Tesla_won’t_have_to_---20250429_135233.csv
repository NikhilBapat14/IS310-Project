"It's okay, the insurance industry is keeping tabs.  Ask about insurance rates before you consider buying anything with any level of automation. Unreasonable rates will mean they're death traps on wheels.",CockBrother,2025-04-29T13:53:51,21
Yet another reason not to buy Tesla.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-29T14:22:05,3
I can't imagine anyone is going to fall for Musk's bullshit promises anymore.  ... all that's left are the MAGA crowd selling their kidneys to afford a symbol.,whys-it-so-cold,2025-04-29T14:24:22,3
"Last week, the US Department of Transportation announced a major change to the Biden-era rule that requires automakers and tech companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles. Under the revised rules, companies will no longer have to report certain crashes, such as those involving a vehicle equipped with a Level 2 advanced driver assist system (ADAS) that resulted in a tow-away, but no injuries, fatalities, or airbag deployments. The change was meant to, in Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s words, “slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety.”  One company that stands to benefit from the rule change is Tesla. Under the previous regime, Elon Musk’s company comprised the bulk of crashes reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) involving vehicles with Level 2 automated systems. But under the revised rule, Tesla’s load will be significantly lighter.  To determine the number of fewer crashes that Tesla will need to report, the group searched the database for tow-away crashes, while filtering out non-Tesla vehicles and any crash involving an injury, fatality, vulnerable road user, and airbag deployment. Of Tesla’s 2,030 crashes, 240 met those criteria, which represents 12 percent of the company’s total reported crashes.

Excellent point.    How long before cPOTUS decrees it illegal for insurance companies to adjust rates for this reason?,accountabilitycounts,2025-04-29T14:02:24,8
"To be fair, the insurance rates are higher because the body work is harder to get done since they seem to (but possibly not now) have had a shortage of replacement panels. Now with their sales slowdown the servicing of busted units might improve.",IAmInTheBasement,2025-04-29T15:08:03,1
"Yeah, for property. But injury is separated out. I guess I should have been more specific.  I absolutely hate how cars are being engineered with absolutely no consideration of repair.",CockBrother,2025-04-29T15:34:00,3
