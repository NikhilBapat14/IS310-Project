Court clerks are supposed to randomly assign cases to a judge. Clearly a clerk is assigning all of these cases to a particular judge.  I'm not sure how that happens. Hmmm...,Peregrine_Falcon,2025-05-05T22:08:47,26

"Even still it's supposed to be random within that venue. But it's clearly not. There are some cases where on days off there is an emergency judge and that rotates in a known way, so you can pick the judge that way (but not really because it's supposed to be for time sensitive matters and when that occurs should be random in theory). But the best part is this judge was not even the one on call for the day the ACLU filed the lawsuit yet he cut his vacation short to take the case.",day25,2025-05-05T15:04:29,47
