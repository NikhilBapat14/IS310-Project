"I'll save you a click because the answer is not even remotely stunning:   > “I don’t know how that would have made much difference,” Biden said.  Which is a politician's way of saying ""no.""   Which has been Biden's attitude towards it the whole time. Literally not even remotely different from what he said at the very beginning.  **EDIT**: People, I am not a Joe Biden fan. This is not a defense of Joe Biden.   I'm merely saying his shitty answer now is the same shitty answer he gave back then and is in no way ""stunning.""",StoppableHulk,2025-05-07T11:26:46,46
">“I meant what I said when I started,” he continued. “I’m preparing to hand this to the next generation. It’s a transition government. But things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away.”  This quote is particularly telling... a lot of people on reddit defending Biden before he dropped out were very aggressive in saying he never said he would be a one term president when he ran in 2020... Well here it is from the horse's mouth, confirmation that he signaled exactly that.  It makes the decision to stay in for so long in 2024 even harder to parse honestly. Did his time in office just make him totally delusional?",RimboTheRebbiter,2025-05-07T11:34:29,12
"The economy simply didn’t improve enough, fast enough, for enough voters across the US. The US has a history of voting out the current party in times of economic hardship. The economy was improving, but it was not yet lifting the entire population (possibly because the economy has shifted in a way that CAN’T lift the entire population). As a result, desperate people voted for “something else”. By and large this is reason the Democrats lost. It really didn’t matter who the candidate was (although it would have helped if whoever the candidate was would have made a clean break from Biden to convince people another Democratic term would improve things in a meaningful way. With Kamala, it was too easy for people to say “if she had all these ideas, and they’re so good, then why hasn’t she already worked to implement them before now?”. Personally, I think the Democrats were doomed from the start because too many people were still hurting economically.",Austin_Peep_9396,2025-05-07T11:55:34,4

"Wouldn’t have guaranteed a win, but it probably would have helped if he had given Harris an extra month or two to work with. She and Walz just needed one or two policies or sound bites to stick and lack of campaign time didn’t help with that. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-07T11:56:24,3
"**From reporter Ron Dicker:**  Former President Joe Biden said in a new interview that the timing of his pullout from the 2024 election wouldn’t have made a difference, suggesting that Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump was inevitable.   “Should you have withdrawn earlier?” the BBC’s Nick Robinson asked in the interview, shared Wednesday.  “I don’t think it would’ve mattered,” Biden replied. “We left at a time when we had a good candidate. She was fully funded.”  The former president said he and his administration were “so successful in our agenda” that it became hard for him to say, “I’m gonna stop now.”  “I meant what I said when I started,” he continued. “I’m preparing to hand this to the next generation. It’s a transition government. But things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away.”  Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-dont-think-it-wouldve-mattered\_n\_681b34d1e4b0529436a1a8ae?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-dont-think-it-wouldve-mattered_n_681b34d1e4b0529436a1a8ae?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-07T11:27:56,2
"Honestly I strong doubt it would have made a difference too.  More time means more time for Republicans to demonize a female candidate.   There is a small percentage of people who say and think they would vote for a female presidential candidate who when they get to the polls vote for a male instead.  Its likely about 3-4% (about 1 in 25-30) and that is enough to flip an election.   Also, there was about 45% of the population that to some extent believed Trump's blatant lies who voted for him, and the electoral college favors Republicans.",Captain_Aware4503,2025-05-07T12:21:10,1
As an outsider it looks like only a white man is more likely to win \[sad but probably true\] so why don't Democrats get organised and find such a candidate? In the whole of US surely there is one outstanding person?,Counterpoint-4,2025-05-07T11:50:17,1

His answer isn't wrong they still would have chosen Harris which means the exact same thing would have happened.  It's not coincidental that both of Trump's victories were against women.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-07T11:55:11,3

"Since it made the difference between holding actual primaries and not holding actual primaries, yes it fucking matters.  Biden was a great President and he did a lot of things right in my book, but he also said that he would only run for one term, so in this particular issue, Biden is being an asshat.",pierre_x10,2025-05-07T11:36:09,0
"a black woman who is not particularly good at giving speeches or dealing with the media, got the 3rd highest vote amount for president in the 2nd highest turnout election in US history. With a stunted rushed 4 month campaign that was plagued with blunders.  Yes, racism and sexism hurt dems. But there were 1000 fucking issues that hurt dems, and trump only won by 1.5%, meaning, roll the dice a dozen times and she would have won around half the times at least.  You think we need a DEI hired white male christian candidate? I'd say that sounds like ignoring the idealogical divide and appealing to specific things that work for republicans.
