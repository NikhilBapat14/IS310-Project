However, some people do just shut down when you use ""fancy"" or ""big"" words. And those people are not gonna respond well to a 9 letter 4 syllable word like ""oligarchy"".

"Oligarchy might sound like a big weird word. But the underlying message is quite basic and simple. It does what appears to be the right way to handle politics: give people *scapegoats*. Define policies in terms of punishing people who make our lives shit. At the same time, Bernie's message is *also* truthful as it correctly identified the source of the problem, and it's backed up with policies that actually help the common folk, not just channel their anger at the scapegoats.  ""Rich people are the predators. They're the evil elites above the law. They have immense power. You are their victim. Your life sucks because they rig the system in their favor. You work hard, yet they rob you of your hard-earned shit.  This is why the prices are high. This is why you can't afford shit. This is why you're in debt in the richest country in the world. This is why you live with your parents in your 30s while they make money doing nothing, out of thin air. This is why you die of cancer while the health insurance death panel decides whether it's cheaper to give you the cure you paid for, or cheaper to risk a lawsuit that won't save you anyway so you probably won't bother.  Here's how we can unrig the system.""  This is a simple, powerful message. It's not hard to understand at all. It is self-evident if you take a moment to think about it. It resonates with people on all sides of the spectrum. It makes people feel that Bernie is sincere, an actual person who gives a shit. I really don't see a complexity problem here.",AbcLmn18,2025-04-27T15:58:48,15

The left being obtuse in their definitions is, for better or for worse, out of the question, I think. The left is the side of people with formal educations (in most cases not all) and I don't know if I'd really feel comfortable myself intentionally misinterpreting the meaning of a word just to fuck with the GOP.

" > Kamala didn't have policies that explicitly hurt somebody, put a blame on somebody for the problems people were facing, so many people (incorrectly) felt like she wasn't going to change anything, she wasn't interested in impacting the balance of power.  Well she openly said multiple times in interviews that she wouldn’t change much from Biden. She called herself a pragmatist and said only a few “bad apples” were to blame for price gouging. Actually she was moving to the right of Biden to keep some of Trump’s first term cuts if you look at her tax policies. It wasn’t clear how she was interested in changing anything that would directly help people deal with the cost of living. Her tax credits were narrow and her price gouging ban was widely considered ineffective even by an Obama administration economist.   Trump was explicit about immigration and trade deals being the reasons he thought people were struggling. He said Democrats were too obsessed with DEI to be effective. Then he spent most of his time emphasizing those ideas by mindlessly yelling into a mic about them. People didn’t think he was a genius, they just thought he had an actual vision for change. Right-wing media spun the details as needed so that people, even immigrants, thought he was only targeting prisoners or violent criminals.  > Progressives very clearly offer actual policy that clearly reshapes the balance of power and clearly helps the common folk.   I agree here, progressive policy should be framed as cutting out special interest groups to focus on directly investing in workers. Single payer healthcare, free public college, higher minimum wage, and other progressive policies are simple and effective.

There were no answers for why we still had a for-profit healthcare system, for why we still had millions of people underemployed or unemployable not getting the money they need to live in an inflating economy. Between Harris and Trump, Trump was the only person telling people 'you'll be taken care of', even if it was a lie and even if it was devoid of specifics.
