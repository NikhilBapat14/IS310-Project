The NY Times can’t criticize trump without punching the left in the face. It’s impossible for them to not both sides anything.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-04T13:00:57,9
the new york times sure prints a lot of nonsense,ponyflip,2025-05-04T13:27:29,4
"> Dr. Alan Garber, president of Harvard, disagrees with President Trump about many things. He is fighting Mr. Trump as the federal government tries to strip Harvard of billions of dollars in research funding and its nonprofit tax status.  > But Dr. Garber agrees with Mr. Trump on one point. In one of the rare interviews he has given since Harvard began its battle with the federal government, Dr. Garber said this week that Harvard has a campus culture problem that needs urgent fixing.  > Harvard has often shut out voices that many liberals disagree with, he said, and it has allowed antisemitism to go unchecked.  > [...]  > To Dr. Garber, defending and reforming Harvard is not a provincial matter. Americans are questioning a higher education system that many see as disconnected from their values. He believes deep funding cuts would impair the kind of innovative work that has made American research universities the global engine for scientific discovery since World War II.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-04T12:41:24,-3
"So the disruptive, violent, antisemitic protesters who harass or assault Jewish students beyond reasonable criticism of the Israeli government didn’t have agency? And Dr. Garber’s honest opinion should just be handwaved away?",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-04T13:23:46,-8
You're just jumping on one of the first comments. The comment said nothing of the sort. Pick your battles.,uncwil,2025-05-04T13:34:33,6
"> So the disruptive, violent, antisemitic protesters who harass or assault Jewish students  I think you have a grave misunderstanding of who those protestors actually are, unless you're trying to No True Scotsman out of it.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-04T13:56:26,4
"I didn’t see reports of any students violently attacking Jewish students. Do you know of any violent attacks by student protestors? Any violence towards people should be condemned.   Also being opposed to America’s support of Israel’s actions is not being anti-Semitic.  It’s dishonest that some people try to equate the two.  Obviously, you can denounce the actions of Israel and our support of those actions while still supporting Jews. I know this because there are great numbers of Jewish people who hold this position.  To many people, it is a moral position.",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-04T15:08:20,4
"[CNN reported on 1/21/25](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/us/harvard-antisemitism-lawsuit):  >  Harvard has come under fire in the past year for how it addresses antisemitic bullying on campus. Much of the criticism and complaints from students and faculty stemmed from the protests and vandalism on campus following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.   >  Last year, Harvard received a failing grade from the Jewish civil rights advocacy group Anti-Defamation League for its policies to protect Jewish students from antisemitism on campus.   > [...]  >  In the federal lawsuit filed by the Brandeis Center and Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education last May, the groups alleged Harvard left “cruel anti-Semitic bullying, harassment, and discrimination” unaddressed for years before and after the Hamas attacks.   >  Students Against Antisemitism filed a separate lawsuit in January 2024 calling Harvard a “bastion of rampant anti Jewish hatred and harassment.”",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-04T22:49:59,-1
"I was looking for examples of VIOLENCE not bullying. Also these are allegations not examples.  I think we both know there was NO VIOLENCE as you wrote.   It’s important to be factual.    If these adult students are being bullied, that is not nice. But then we also need to crack down on those frat bros.  Let me tell you —- they are nasty fuckers to many women and they are cruelly misogynistic. This kind of discrimination and cruelty is common for many women. Cops often tell us that these nasty words and even threats are NOT against the law and their hands are tied.  So I can empathize with the hurt feelings.",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-05T14:39:32,1
