Then like the spineless weasels they are, when they obtained any semblance of power, the opposition is no longer allowed to *complain* or *call them out* because it hurts their feelings? Fuck alllllllllll the way off. You're fascists trying to cosplay as statesmen when all you've ever wanted was power to abuse those you deemed less than for your sheer enjoyment.

Of course you read a headline like this and it is immediately infuriating and exhausting. But in reality, this is just another early effort to start to make their viewers think, ""You know what?

Participants were asked to list as many words that start with F, A or S in one minute. Another minute was devoted to coming up with curse words that start with those three letters. The study found those who came up with the most F, A and S words also produced the most swear words.  That‚Äôs a sign of intelligence ‚Äúto the degree that language is correlated with intelligence,‚Äù said Jay, who authored the study. ‚ÄúPeople that are good at language are good at generating a swearing vocabulary.‚Äù  Swearing can also be associated with social intelligence, Jay added.  ‚ÄúHaving the strategies to know where and when it‚Äôs appropriate to swear, and when it‚Äôs not,‚Äù Jay said, ‚Äúis a social cognitive skill like picking the right clothes for the right occasion.
