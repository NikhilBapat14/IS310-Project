"That might be a touch maudlin but he got taken to task pretty hard over a couple of scandals he had in his career. I say ""maudlin"" because I'm having trouble thinking of something that really prevented him from attaining some of the highest highs this country has to offer.  The biggest thing was probably the Anita Hill saga. There's been oceans of ink spilled on what happened and regardless of where you come down on it that's probably the closest that Thomas ever really came to being blocked from advancing. If there's any point at which his future career may have seemed to be threatened, the Anita Hill hearings were probably it.  There's a lot of noise that got made later about his wife's activism and his proximity to her and his leveraging his position to help her do her work. That may have caused a rift in his personal life that was unpleasant.  There's also been *a lot* of light shed fairly recently on Thomas' personal habits which range from the moderately eccentric (having an apartment with no furniture but a massive pile of porn) to the offensively gross (openly discussing said pornography with coworkers and subordinates regardless if they wanted to or not.) That probably wasn't a lot of fun.  As for blaming it on liberals, that scans for someone with his political perspective. There's a racial dimension to the criticisms of Thomas in that a lot of liberals (especially white liberals) expected someone like Thomas to be more liberal because he's black and that kind of criticism from white liberals, I can imagine, landed like nails on a chalk board. The term ""Uncle Tom"" has been applied to Thomas quite a bit from liberal circles and not always by people who have an informed view as to what that term means.  Again, I would say that ""ruined his life"" is a bit dramatic. He was a Supreme Court justice, was very wealthy, and enjoyed access to the halls of power for quite some time in a position that's almost impossible to get removed from. I think it's fair to say that a lot of the heat Thomas got was politically motivated but he still had a pretty long track record of objectively reprehensible behavior.  Sure, someone pointing out that you sexually harassing interns is a problem because they don't like you politically is maybe not the most honest actor but that doesn't mean that you're not doing something that's wrong.",HeloRising,2023-06-29T04:06:54,2
