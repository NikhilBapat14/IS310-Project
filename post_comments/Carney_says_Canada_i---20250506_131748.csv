"I mean, that‚Äôs Trump though. It‚Äôs always been him. Unless you‚Äôre on his crap  list he he‚Äôs rarely gonna be mad at you in person. I suppose if you‚Äôre debating him as well. And even then I‚Äôd be willing to bet he would be quite cordial and nice.  One of his better attributes is, he‚Äôs willing to forgive people who went against him.  It‚Äôs like it never even happened if they change their mind or even just agreed to be nice to him   All that said, I do wish you would tone down some of the rhetoric. I wish strong Trump would come out only when necessary.",RedditPoster05,2025-05-06T18:15:59,-16

"Canada would be a major player though, far more significant than most States. Why would we deny them statehood and the rights that come with it?
