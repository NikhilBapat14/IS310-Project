"Trump should be a big fan of this, because according to him, it’s actually the other countries that pay the tariffs.

I think this is a smart move. Not only does it mean people will constantly see how much these policies are costing them but it will make it harder for retailers to keep prices higher when the tariffs eventually end if people can continue seeing what the base price is,AbsoluteRubbish,2025-05-08T14:45:21,21
"A nice idea, but the best a retailer could do is say ""our overall prices have increased by x% since [date] due to tariffs."" Anything more detailed would involve overhauling the entire way the company's computer system is set up. Not every product will be equally affected, unless a business raises the cost of every item equally to offset larger wholesale costs on tariffed items, which I doubt they're doing. Walmart probably won't make you pay the same percentage more for bologna as earbuds because earbuds are more expensive for them to buy.    Like tell me you've never worked retail without telling me you've never worked retail, sir.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-08T14:37:49,20
"What's great about this is that if it gets enough momentum and enough visibility, retailers are going to want to do this regardless if the law passes, unless they are MAGA, most likely. If everybody starts doing this, even if the law doesn't pass, those that don't will be instantly alienated by market demand for honest pricing. Retailers are fully incentivized to do so anyway because they don't want to take the blame for their high prices. I really hope this happens.",geoffsykes,2025-05-08T19:02:23,7

"I’m all for transparent pricing. And not just so MAGA consumers know who to blame for the tariffs. It’s also to product all consumers from price gouging.   Look what happened during the pandemic. Yes, we had inflation from supply chain issues, but lots of companies also just use the opportunity to increase profits.   We don’t have nearly as many “free markets” as you would think, certainly not in the short term.

"You're trying to roll a dozen issues into one.  They are separate issues that are only indirectly connected.  Tariffs are not about labor laws, plastic pollution, or living wages.  You fundamentally do not understand what a tariff is.  A tariff is a tax paid by the *importing company*, in this case a US company, that they pay to the federal government.  The importing company is not going to reduce their profit margin.  Instead, what they will do is increase the amount that consumers, which is *you*, pay for the goods.    Does that hurt the importing company?  Indirectly yes, because they will sell less goods because customers cannot afford them.  Does it hurt the average American (you)?  Yes, because you now have to pay more for the same goods, and you cannot afford to buy as many things.  The importing company can try to move the sourcing of their goods to within the US, but that is also infeasible.  Not only do Americans demand higher wages (thus making the end product even **more** expensive), it takes years to establish a factory capable of producing even simple goods that Americans demand.

Payoff with what?  The deficit is going to explode even more when they try to rely on tariffs while cutting taxes.  We're going to see more inflation as a result.  The working class is going to get shafted by republicans yet again since tariffs affect lower income people more than they do the top 1% of earners.  It is the biggest tax increase on the working class in US history.  To say nothing of the layoffs it is causing as we speak as the market responds negatively to tariffs on all this stuff we need.  People like dock workers are expected to be laid off plenty in the next month because of tariffs.  The economy is headed straight for a recession.,Rit91,2025-05-09T03:38:18,2

"You’re highly mischaracterizing first of all…. And secondly many of these corporations should even exist after they were already bailed out and now they deserve more than ever to fail because they outsourced good American paying jobs to foreign nations so that they could exploit workers. Now they want Americans to foot the bill for damage? No crash and burn, new companies will form out of their ashes and pay Americans living wages. I don’t understand why this is such a hard concept.  Your price example is a ludicrous embellishment that resembles fear mongering tactics used by extremists. It’s akin to the argument people used to deny fast food wage increases; “are you ready to pay $20 for a Big Mac?” Obviously never happened.   Tariffs are about all of those things I have mentioned, what else are they about then? Penalizing the companies that have outsourced the labor. Penalizing consumers from buying foreign. Attempting to protect domestic manufacturing.   I’ll continue to use the liberal/left argument when it comes to tip culture and business that rely on tips to pay employees- if you can’t afford to pay a living wage then you shouldn’t be in business. These greedy corporations are reaping record profits year over year all the while there’s a diminishing of the American working/middle class.  The American consumer is willing to pay premiums for products made in America so that fellow Americans can be payed living wages and go to work with dignity.

They may increase costs even further beyond this for administrative costs to deal with tariffs or exploring options on procurement. With all these additional costs, it’s easy and typical to just apply a percent increase across the board which ensures some extra profit on top of the tariff costs.    So yes, they will increase beyond the tariff costs and some of it will be necessary to even maintain profits. Considering purchasing power will go down, profits are likely to go down anyways with decreased buying at elevated prices outside of essential products.",MattinglyBaseball,2025-05-08T19:41:49,1

Companies don't like to make smaller margins on individual sales; I brought up one example of how an example import product would be impacted by margin pricing.   You're correct that not every component is necessarily imported, but your assumption that production costs would increase by less than tariff rates is wrong. For example, many automotive components cross borders many times between Mexico, Canada, and the United States on their way to become finished products from raw materials. For example, see this article about a transmission component: https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/trump-tariffs-car-part-crosses-canada-us-mexico-borders-7-times   If you take a $100 lump of material (again, chosen for ease of calculation rather than to model any specific product) and it moved across borders five times, subject to import duties each time (which, as you can see based on the article I linked, is not in any way outlandish), it's price (assuming **nobody** along the way made **any** profit, other than the government because of tariffs), it would cost $177.16 the fifth time it crossed.

If the Democrats used their power and political clout anywhere near as much as they could guys like Trump wouldn't even have had a chance in hell of getting into office not to mention getting away with the crap that he's doing.

The Democrats sit on their asses because their entire political strategy relies upon allowing the Republicans to screw up the country and running off of how terrible the Republicans are rather than based on improving anything. If the Democrats improve the country, especially if they put in roadblocks to stop the Republicans from screwing up the country then they'd have much less ""REPUBLICANS BAD!!!"" to campaign on.

"Not like this, they don’t. If you believe Trump’s chart of “tariffs” from other countries, you’re as stupid as he is. Those are trade deficits, not tariffs. Trade deficits are not money “lost” to those countries, it’s money spent on stuff. Other countries are not “screwing you” by selling stuff to you, that’s just trade, and it’s what drives the world economy.",nalex66,2025-05-09T07:07:12,3

"I don't know why you think these are different statements, but ok.  Worker pay does not in fact ""have"" to increase to account for inflation. For proof, look at what's happened since the pandemic began. Inflation has been around 30%. Worker pay has not gone up 30%.  Is that more clear?",Expensive-Fun4664,2025-05-09T10:24:02,0

"Ah, this sounds like a reading comprehension issue on your end.   No, there's no universal law that forces worker pay increases when inflation happens. When you have inflation and you don't have corresponding wage growth (you know, the situation were in currently) you get a reduction in consumer purchasing power.   My statement was that, to maintain economic homeostasis (hence the qualifier ""to account for inflation""), worker pay needs to correspondingly increase. ""Needs"" and ""has to"" are **synonymous**. Inflation can very much happen without wage growth, but if it does, it causes economic problems.",wormhole_alien,2025-05-09T11:26:09,2
