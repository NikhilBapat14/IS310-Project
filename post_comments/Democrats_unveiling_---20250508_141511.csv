I think this is a smart move. Not only does it mean people will constantly see how much these policies are costing them but it will make it harder for retailers to keep prices higher when the tariffs eventually end if people can continue seeing what the base price is,AbsoluteRubbish,2025-05-08T14:45:21,21
"A nice idea, but the best a retailer could do is say ""our overall prices have increased by x% since [date] due to tariffs."" Anything more detailed would involve overhauling the entire way the company's computer system is set up. Not every product will be equally affected, unless a business raises the cost of every item equally to offset larger wholesale costs on tariffed items, which I doubt they're doing. Walmart probably won't make you pay the same percentage more for bologna as earbuds because earbuds are more expensive for them to buy.

"What's great about this is that if it gets enough momentum and enough visibility, retailers are going to want to do this regardless if the law passes, unless they are MAGA, most likely. If everybody starts doing this, even if the law doesn't pass, those that don't will be instantly alienated by market demand for honest pricing. Retailers are fully incentivized to do so anyway because they don't want to take the blame for their high prices. I really hope this happens.",geoffsykes,2025-05-08T19:02:23,7

"You're trying to roll a dozen issues into one.  They are separate issues that are only indirectly connected.  Tariffs are not about labor laws, plastic pollution, or living wages.  You fundamentally do not understand what a tariff is.  A tariff is a tax paid by the *importing company*, in this case a US company, that they pay to the federal government.  The importing company is not going to reduce their profit margin.  Instead, what they will do is increase the amount that consumers, which is *you*, pay for the goods.    Does that hurt the importing company?  Indirectly yes, because they will sell less goods because customers cannot afford them.  Does it hurt the average American (you)?  Yes, because you now have to pay more for the same goods, and you cannot afford to buy as many things.  The importing company can try to move the sourcing of their goods to within the US, but that is also infeasible.  Not only do Americans demand higher wages (thus making the end product even **more** expensive), it takes years to establish a factory capable of producing even simple goods that Americans demand.

Payoff with what?  The deficit is going to explode even more when they try to rely on tariffs while cutting taxes.  We're going to see more inflation as a result.  The working class is going to get shafted by republicans yet again since tariffs affect lower income people more than they do the top 1% of earners.  It is the biggest tax increase on the working class in US history.  To say nothing of the layoffs it is causing as we speak as the market responds negatively to tariffs on all this stuff we need.

They may increase costs even further beyond this for administrative costs to deal with tariffs or exploring options on procurement. With all these additional costs, it‚Äôs easy and typical to just apply a percent increase across the board which ensures some extra profit on top of the tariff costs.    So yes, they will increase beyond the tariff costs and some of it will be necessary to even maintain profits. Considering purchasing power will go down, profits are likely to go down anyways with decreased buying at elevated prices outside of essential products.",MattinglyBaseball,2025-05-08T19:41:49,1

You're correct that not every component is necessarily imported, but your assumption that production costs would increase by less than tariff rates is wrong. For example, many automotive components cross borders many times between Mexico, Canada, and the United States on their way to become finished products from raw materials. For example, see this article about a transmission component:¬†https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/trump-tariffs-car-part-crosses-canada-us-mexico-borders-7-times   If you take a $100 lump of material (again, chosen for ease of calculation rather than to model any specific product) and it moved across borders five times, subject to import duties each time (which, as you can see based on the article I linked, is not in any way outlandish), it's price (assuming **nobody** along the way made **any** profit, other than the government because of tariffs), it would cost $177.16 the fifth time it crossed.

"The Democrats do a tiny fraction of what they could, and the vast majority of it is simply cleaning up after the last time the Republicans are in power instead of doing anything to stop the Republicans from screwing up the country AGAIN the next they're in power and otherwise improving the country in general. What we do see is what's snuck in, it's far far far far FAR less than they could have done.  If the Democrats used their power and political clout anywhere near as much as they could guys like Trump wouldn't even have had a chance in hell of getting into office not to mention getting away with the crap that he's doing. Especially after Nixon they should have had means to get rid of blatantly corrupt presidents who openly do unconstitutional and illegal stuff like Trump is immediately and without impeachment or party affiliation being a factor. At the very least there should already be a means to severely limit such a president's ability to give executive orders.  The Democrats sit on their asses because their entire political strategy relies upon allowing the Republicans to screw up the country and running off of how terrible the Republicans are rather than based on improving anything. If the Democrats improve the country, especially if they put in roadblocks to stop the Republicans from screwing up the country then they'd have much less ""REPUBLICANS BAD!!!"" to campaign on. And they love campaigning on that because it doesn't require them to actually DO anything.  Yes, the Democrats are completely unwilling to publicize what little they actually do. They really should at least have their own equally popular but far less sleazy version of Fox News and at least a dozen other media outlets people actually watch on their side a long time ago, just like the Republicans do. Not only to do the Democrats do very little at the end of it all but the average person really has to go out of their way to find out about anything they actually do end up doing.  If the Democrats spent the last several decades doing even 1/10th of what they could do to help the country, they'd win every election with ease from local up to federal level and the Republican party would've faded in obscurity a long time ago. However, they would require them to put in some work, something Democrats are allergic to doing.  Say what you will about the Republican party, but they are RELENTLESS when it comes to getting their agenda pushed through and stonewalling the Democratic party. This is why they keep winning, and why they keep getting what they want even when they're not in power far more than they logically have any right to be able to. If the Democrats had that kind of drive we wouldn't be here and the country would be far far far far FAR better off. There is zero reason they can't do the same right now.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-08T23:26:53,2
"Please point to where I said worker pay automatically increases with inflation? That's a whole new sentence, my guy.   I *think* I said, ""Worker pay **has** to increase to account for inflation.""

"I don't know why you think these are different statements, but ok.  Worker pay does not in fact ""have"" to increase to account for inflation. For proof, look at what's happened since the pandemic began. Inflation has been around 30%. Worker pay has not gone up 30%.  Is that more clear?",Expensive-Fun4664,2025-05-09T10:24:02,0

"Ah, this sounds like a reading comprehension issue on your end.   No, there's no universal law that forces worker pay increases when inflation happens. When you have inflation and you don't have corresponding wage growth (you know, the situation were in currently) you get a reduction in consumer purchasing power.   My statement was that, to maintain economic homeostasis (hence the qualifier ""to account for inflation""), worker pay needs to correspondingly increase. ""Needs"" and ""has to"" are **synonymous**. Inflation can very much happen without wage growth, but if it does, it causes economic problems.",wormhole_alien,2025-05-09T11:26:09,2
