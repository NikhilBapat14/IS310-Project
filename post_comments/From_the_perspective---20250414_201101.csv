"Amazing how welcoming Trump was to him....and Bukele wasn't even wearing a suit!  Bullying towards our allies, while kissing the asses of authoritarians.  I welcome you to listen to the soundbites.

"Deportation is a weird thing. You're ejecting someone from your borders - but US and International law dictates that you can only deport someone to their country of origin. UNLESS you find another country willing to receive said deportee. Marco Rubio went to El Salvador in February to discuss a permanent arrangement with El Salvador whereby they would become willing to receive in all cases. In all cases. So persons whom you have no paperwork to determine nationality, or persons whom you have destroyed the paperwork of to prove a point. Or persons whom originated in the US. For $8 million we negotiated this deal. This is why Trump and Bukele are so friendly. When the shit hits the fan, Trump can call his buddy Bukele and issue a standing liquidate order, and just chuck as many people who don't fit his vision of America as he can get there before someone steps in - if anyone exists.  Shit, they were talking about it in the Golden Office today - Trump said Bukele was going to need five more prisons - who do you think is going to pay for those?  Being in Trump's orbit, his pocket, wherever - is a gamble right now. You're gambling that his regime is going to end up getting what it wants, and that you will continue to benefit from it, and that you will have enough MAD type shit on each other that you will both support pretty much any move the other makes as a result.  But you're also failing to understand that on a basic fundamental level he doesn't operate on the same wavelengths as normal people do. He will not allow anyone to gain from anything unless he gains more than anyone else. He is obsessed with winning - which may seem like a good reason to back him - but will also end up blowing up in everyone's face if and when he risks one throw too many.  So El Salvador is banking on Trump's regime not only succeeding but thriving - needing an endless dumping ground for American undesirables of any caste, creed, race, ethnicity, or nation of origin.  I really hope they're wrong.",alkalineruxpin,2025-04-14T22:08:05,38
"Trump is giving them money to take prisoners. Countries like receiving money, and Trump is promising to send him more and more people, which means more and more money.  Long-term consequences all depend on the next election. It also depends on how bad things get there. If they're killing people and dumping them in mass graves, it could fall back on him.

"I think he must be thinking short term or expect a Democratic administration to treat them with kid gloves. If I were a politician that cared, I'd be very clear with them that when Democrats have power again that there will be consequences for holding people from the US. Otherwise, without a unified response from Dems, there is really no reason for him to believe that Trump isn't the bigger threat and that he should do what he says.   This is why I think Democrats have to get tough across the board. The uneven expectations is why so many CEO's and media outlets are bending the knee to Trump. They feel that there will be some, even if minor consequences under a Trump admin but none by Democrats because they don't tend to be punitive. It's game theory and Democrats are bad at the not being a pushover part. This is especially important to foreign policy and why Canada targeting red States is the exact type or focused proportional response Democrats need to adopt. In the long run, it'll disincentivize foreign countries from taking extreme actions that isn't effectively bipartisan in the US.      If that doesn't happen, there are very strong benefits for countries to work with Trump to harm his political opponents and a lot at risk, if they decline. It's highly unlikely any other country is going to retaliate against them for illegally holding Americans and if they do, Trump would likely try to prevent it.",Pregxi,2025-04-14T20:37:48,26

El Salvador worked to erode the US constitution with these actions and they should face extreme consequences for their actions. The best way to ensure no country ever acts as a concentration camp for Republican presidents is to full on embargo any country that does so when you have power.

Then if/when new Democrat president comes in and says give me back these people, he says “ok”. Meanwhile he made some $ for El Salvador just doing what the US president asked him.  As for Venezuela, first they say they don’t want their people back. Trump says well we don’t want them either. El Salvador says I’ll take them for a fee. Well Venezuela gets mad because they really wanted to force the US to accept them. In addition to this, relations were already strained between Venezuela and El Salvador. Venezuela, an ardent supporter of Putin, is happy to let their gangs run rampant causing chaos across Latin America and the US. As for the people of El Salvador, they are just happy they can now go outside at night without fear. Bukele’s approval rating is something like 90+%",Snoobunny3910,2025-04-15T21:19:26,3

We have super max facilities that are more than capable of containing criminals of this level.  They should be used.  Second, these things always blow back.  It was bad enough with the rendition programs.  The people responsible for that still haven't recovered from some of the decisions they made.  If we have a criminal element, then WE should deal with that element.  We've paid good money for the systems we have... let's use them.",mcgunner1966,2025-04-14T22:58:11,2

The only concern you have is that when/if administrations change, I’m certain the democrats will want all those imprisoned abroad returned. I would say operate under a short term mindset until proven otherwise. Other than that, this is great for El Salvador. I’m sure the US is paying for the facilities. Just sucks for Americans.

I have family from El Salvador that made it through the civil war they overwhelmingly support him and are excited for the opportunities he's bringing up El Salvador. Manny are visiting again and thinking of retiring there as it feels safe.    If he's just going to lock people indefinitely or step aside if he loses an election is yet to be seen.    Now on this issue short term it's a win and being in the good graces of Trump has immediate monetary benefits.

"It’s a paradox…. A lot of countries struggle with gang violence so how was Bukele was able to successfully crack down on it in El Salvador?   Well first of all, El Salvador had a problem with gangs. A big problem. And people were looking for a solution. Bukele ran on an anti-establishment platform promising change.   His war on gang violence began he declared a state of emergency which gave him a bunch of extra authority. (He was able to do this after a gang murdered something like 85+ people back in 2022). Well apparently the legislature finally had enough after that because they approved his request for a declaration of emergency.   This gave him sweeping power to detain all the gang members, all friends and family of the gang members (and anyone else caught the 5 mile radius as well).   To be fair, a not insignificant number innocent and semi-innocent people probably got caught up all this. And critics say the people of El Salvador lost a lot of their democratic rights as a result of the crackdown…  BUT crime dropped 98%. Before Bukele, El Salvador was ranked among the most dangerous countries in the world. Businesses had to pay “la renta” to the gangs, entire towns and neighborhoods were under gang control, public transport drivers were often targeted for extortion, people avoided going out after dark, young people were targeted for recruitment by the gangs, many crimes went unpunished and the police were underfunded, outnumbered or corrupt…. All the typical things you see.   All that changed because Bukele went so hard on the problem. Some people say “at what cost?” but most are just happy to have some peace.

Which is directly in opposition to the order.",Marchtmdsmiling,2025-04-17T16:24:54,3
It says they should do anything in their power to get him back. And all trump would have to do is nod at bukele and it would happen. Don't give me any bs about foreign affairs. This has nothing at all to do with foreign affairs. This would have exactly zero impact on our relationship with El salvadore. Which in the end isn't even an important relationship relatively. They are redefining the word facilitate. And Stephen Miller is just straight up lying about what the supreme court ruling says. The Supreme court decided 9 0 that they all deserve due process so any way you cut it this is a loss for trump. The question is if trump and Miller get to kill this innocent guy or not.,Marchtmdsmiling,2025-04-17T15:54:57,1

"Again. They can tell them to do everything in their power to get him back. Yes that does not mean forcing the other country. But do you actually believe that bukele wouldn't do anything trump asked at this point?    O and trump is correct?  What about the federal judge from Texas who forced the biden administration to restart the wait in Mexico thing, which required complex negotiations with Mexico.  That was pretty heavy in the judicial meddling in foreign affairs. You have no idea how the law works and are just spouting whatever your orange prophet and his boot licking toadies shit into your head",Marchtmdsmiling,2025-04-18T04:46:41,2
Also it's not asking for a citizen as it normally would be. Although that happens all the time with extradition. Which I'm sure we have a treaty with them about. But it is asking them to send someone back who we are paying them to detain. We are paying his bills.,Marchtmdsmiling,2025-04-18T04:55:00,1
