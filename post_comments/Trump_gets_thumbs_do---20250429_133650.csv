"Man, I really lost my hope in Americans.  Land of the thief, home of the slave.  Everybody keeps holding on their last bit of equity by working themselves to death, being aware of the inequality, unlawful living conditions, fueled by their programming, telling themselves they're somehow living in the ""greatest"" country in the world.  bone appletea",kradist,2025-04-29T13:48:10,1
"Saying ""all Americans"" is ridiculous, ignorant and extremely naive.   America is a country of 350 + million people, it's a country the size of most of Europe, a majority of Americans don't even vote or are independent/moderates. You act like people can just flip a switch and make everything right in the world, while living in a country that is designed to keep people in debt and behind.   You're in Europe, and have probably never even been to America, so who are you to speak so confidently about a country full of people you don't even know? About a place you've never been? Where all of your info comes from TV shows or the news?",MrTreeWizard,2025-04-29T14:09:50,3
"This shit would never fly in the EU with such little repercussion.  I didn't say ""all"".   Just not enough.  People are waiting for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Shumer to rise up and oppose the oligarchs?   pathetic...",kradist,2025-04-29T14:25:39,1
