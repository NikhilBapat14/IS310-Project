Because everything they say is just lies to distract people?,Cool-Presentation538,2025-04-27T12:21:44,41
Because the GOP sucks at the economy.  They deficit spend to give tax cuts to the rich and then want to take away things like social security.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-04-27T12:30:45,25
When has a Republican budget bill *ever* added up??,def_indiff,2025-04-27T12:23:59,13

"Strip social benefits and still have the highest costing budget. It doesn't make sense. Poor people are not the ones bankrupting the government, corporate and the wealthy persons welfare is. Can you imagine how many problems could be solves if 4.5 trillion dollars was allocated towards building up the middle class instead of lining the 1% pockets.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-27T13:11:34,9

I’m assuming this is why trump’s not even bailing out red states suffering from natural disasters right now. And why federal employees had to be cut to quickly and haphazardly. They have to squeeze every budgetary dollar so they can pretend to make the numbers add up to meet the reconciliation rules.,survivor2bmaybe,2025-04-27T13:20:09,2
Oh no. Someone might just ignore the process and call a bill reconciliation and completely ignore everything. I. am. shocked.,loogie97,2025-04-27T14:17:55,2

the simple reason is they cant do addition with such large numbers.,fudgeplank,2025-04-27T13:20:32,1
