The thought of Vance becoming president scares the living shit out of me; we'd be guaranteed to become a theocratic oligarchy. That neo-Nazi sympathizing Christian Nationalist is poison.,invalidpassword,2025-05-04T02:44:37,20
"There was little sense, in the days before Trump‚Äôs pick, that Vance held the pole position. Later¬†[reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-vp-decision.html)¬†revealed a lobbying campaign: Rupert Murdoch and his allies tried to talk Trump out of Vance, as did Ken Griffin, the chief executive of Citadel, and even Kellyanne Conway. But Trump was swayed by other voices: Don Jr., Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, who reportedly¬†[told](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/tucker-carlson-jd-vance-trump.html)¬†Trump that if he picked Rubio or Burgum he was likelier to be assassinated by MAGA‚Äôs enemies.  This was the moment we could see the structure of Trump‚Äôs first term giving way to the structure of his second. Trump‚Äôs first administration was almost like a European coalition government: Trump governed in an uneasy alliance with a Republican Party he did not fully control or even like, with a business community in which many viewed him as a buffoon, with a staff that saw part of its role as curbing and containing the boss‚Äôs most destructive impulses, atop an administrative state that often resisted his demands. That friction frustrated Trump and many of his first-term allies. It was also why the most dire predictions for his first term largely did not come true and why so many wrongly predicted that his second term would follow the same script.",PapyrusKami74,2025-05-04T02:32:23,12

I like how the writer confirmed he is not AI in the first sentence by breaking the boundaries of the prompt ü§£  Anyways a perfunctory glance can point to a dozen earlier moments that foretold it all that the NYT orangewashed to sound reasonable. Fuck the nyt. Old grey lady has gone senile.,XcotillionXof,2025-05-04T05:23:49,5

I love how you talk like that's not already in full motion.,ZedCee,2025-05-04T03:16:36,18
"But Trump‚Äôs second term was never going to follow the same script because it has a completely different structure. This isn‚Äôt a coalition government; it‚Äôs a royal court. Trump is surrounded by courtiers who wield influence so long as they maintain his favor and not a moment longer. When is the last time he heard the word ‚Äúno,‚Äù or was told, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir, you can‚Äôt‚Äù? In his first term, Trump either sought or was steered toward advisers and appointments that would reassure many of his doubters; in his second, he has prized loyalists who will do what they‚Äôre told and enforcers who will ensure that others fall in line as well.",PapyrusKami74,2025-05-04T02:32:35,14
"I may talk that way, but it's not necessarily what I really think. The ball's been in motion since before Thiel bought J D. a Senate seat and Yarvin's Cathedral Network States plan grew roots. Sometimes I censure myself a bit because my son tells me to be careful who's boat I rock.",invalidpassword,2025-05-04T03:39:35,10
"The lack of context everyone has on Yarvin/Thiel and what Vance actually stands for is what scares me the most out of all this.   There‚Äôs an entire (pretty prominent) subculture in tech that is cheering a lot of this on. They don‚Äôt just want to regress social policies like many conservatives usually do, they want to burn down the whole system.   They‚Äôre doing it, right now, and we‚Äôre all fighting over individual issues instead of seeing the forest through the trees. Not that all of those aren‚Äôt critically important, but none of them will matter if the entire system is dismantled.",waterw1ngs,2025-05-04T07:57:08,6
