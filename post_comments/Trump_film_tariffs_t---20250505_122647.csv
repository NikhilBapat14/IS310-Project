"How is it that we have become so accustomed to US gov't policy being announced on Truth Social? I mean, that's probably how the government agencies involved hear it as well. Used to be people would talk about how crazy that is but not any more.",asIsaidtomyfriend,2025-05-05T12:35:23,7

"There will not be any trade agreement with this lunatic. Nations will sit back and wait for this unsustainable trade war to fizzle. China will force him into a humiliating backdown.  In any case, trade negotiations take years to complete and the vast majority of his demands cannot be agreed to by GB. It will certainly not accept dodgy chlorinated chicken or hormone laden beef.  He cannot tariff non physical items in any case. Movies do not arrive as film reels by ship or aeroplane to ports and this is the only way to tariff imports.  Movies are sent electronically in most cases and if a print is required it can be made domestically.  His stupidity is gob smacking and there is potentially years more of it to come. What will he come up with next?",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T05:00:14,1
