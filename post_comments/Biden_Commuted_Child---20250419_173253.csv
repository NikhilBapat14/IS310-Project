"Thomas Sanders had been on death row since 2014, when he was convicted for murdering 12-year-old Lexis Roberts, according to KALB-TV in Louisiana.  In December 2024, Sanders was appealing his sentence at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans when Biden commuted his and 36 other inmates‘ sentences to life in prison.  Joe Biden, always looking out for those criminal elements!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-19T18:38:05,68
Why would Joe Biden commute the sentence of an alleged child killer? Who was lobbying on behalf of that man?,chrismireya,2025-04-19T18:10:05,22

Which is why prisoners with life sentences should have to work off their stay. Solitary if they don't.,whippingboy4eva,2025-04-20T08:50:34,8
"Of course there are arguments against the death penalty... The main one being, it sometimes means innocent people are executed.",shy_hulud_420,2025-04-20T01:01:39,41
Actually the death sentence is more costly to tax payers.,NotYetPerfect,2025-04-19T22:33:56,25
Starting to wonder why life in prison without a chance of parole isn't considered cruel and unusual punishment but the death penalty is. The only difference between the two is effectively how long it takes and the cost to the tax payers.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-04-19T23:39:41,12
"I have one, I don’t think it’s morally okay to take a life unless it’s to immediately save or defend an innocent. Keeping them in prison keeps them from hurting someone else, and that’s enough for me.",kw-42,2025-04-19T21:54:43,5
Kamala Harris being the top cop in California is a sufficient argument against the death penalty.,AGEthereal,2025-04-19T22:04:58,1
