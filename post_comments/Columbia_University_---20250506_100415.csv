Its always the worker punished for this shit.  always.,Skraelings,2025-05-06T10:10:26,24
So weird how the “jobs creating” president who “alone can fix” the economy is responsible for eliminating tons of jobs and derailing the economy.  And all in his first 100 days!!!,DmAc724,2025-05-06T10:11:09,16
Imagine this multiplied by every university that does any significant NIH research; as the overhead allocations changed from \~50% to 15%.,ratedsar,2025-05-06T10:11:29,7
This will be about a .9% reduction in staff.,kaputnik11,2025-05-06T18:08:27,-2
Tons? He has directly contributed to the elimination of more than 280k workers. That is more than a few tons.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-06T10:41:15,9
"It does create a huge glut of PhDs that will now look for work at private companies, for basically any pay they can find.",0002millertime,2025-05-06T10:15:14,5
"Yeah, I'm basically in a panic attack for probably the next 2 years at minimum so thats great.  My poor liver.  This career ends not sure what ill do honestly.  Sure as shit wont be going back into science while this muppet is in charge.  edit: not a phd.",Skraelings,2025-05-06T10:21:26,2
Tons is plural.  It efficiently covers “few tons” “tons and tons” “shit tons” etc etc etc,DmAc724,2025-05-06T11:44:27,3
"Europe and Canada are recruiting them. The packages are actually really nice, too. They typically include relocation expenses, a monthly stipend, guaranteed work for x amount of years, a path to citizenship, and housing costs.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-06T10:42:23,6
"Yes, but if you have student loans (and a large percentage do), those packages will not be able to provide enough pay to cover it.  I worked in Europe for several years, and had to move back to the US to work in biotech to be able to afford my payments. Almost nobody in Europe has debt, so the pay is lower.",0002millertime,2025-05-06T10:50:32,2
