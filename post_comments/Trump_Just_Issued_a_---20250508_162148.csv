">“The U.S. calls for, ideally, a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. Hopefully, an acceptable ceasefire will be observed, and both Countries will be held accountable for respecting the sanctity of these direct negotiations,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.  >The president further threatened, “If the ceasefire is not respected, the U.S. and its partners will impose further sanctions.”  BRUTAL lmao  yeah no, that's not going to work and makes us look stupid",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-08T19:14:37,116

Beyond that, rebuilding Ukraine is going to be big business and we'll be in a perfect position to benefit.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-09T09:06:40,1
