"I want to mention what I see really going on with this picture. The separation of church and state is enshrined in the US Constitution. With Trump depicting himself as the Pope, the Representative of Christ on Earth, a religious leader with a huge sphere of influence globally, Trump is sending the message ( in a dog whistle type of way ) that he is endorsing and advocating for an American theocracy. Some people will look at this and see just a parody or joking around. I cannot stress to you how much this is not joking around. We‚Äôve heard his rhetoric. We‚Äôve witnessed the sycophantic bowing  and scraping from the yes-men he surrounds himself with. We‚Äôve seen the billboards and posters and T-shirts depicting Trump as the second coming of Christ. I‚Äôve seen some pretty flagrant and offensive depictions. For his entire political career, he has made use of religion as a fulcrum to leverage more followers and increase his political capital. What Trump and his lackeys are doing here, is symbolically representing the boundary encroaching and inappropriate reach of this administration‚Äòs actions and agenda. This is a pictorial representation of his administration‚Äôs goal to continually push the envelope of what is allowed both constitutionally and ethically. This brings me to my next point.   This administration‚Äôs actions have a deeper agenda than what may be apparent on the surface. This is misdirection at its most insidious. Every time he or his team does something like this, whether it be depicting himself as a religious leader or any other equally outrageous act, we have to look very closely at what‚Äôs going on around this act, especially what‚Äôs happening some distance away from it. We have to ask ourselves the question: what is this felon and his administration attempting to distract our attention from? Make no mistake. This is certainly a way to perform legerdemain on a mass scale. The most efficient way to shift public focus is to offend lots of people at once. That elicits an impulsive reaction from the public which generates its own headlines.",VicodinJones,2025-05-02T23:10:39,35

"Donald is the Antichrist and his followers are in a cult. I couldn't understand why it bothers, damn near angers me when I hear them speak. I simply will not deal with fools and stupidity.

Leviticus 14:33 When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. 34You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.

"  What is an example of blasphemy  ChatGPT said:  Blasphemy generally refers to showing disrespect or irreverence toward God or sacred things. It can involve actions, words, or behaviors that dishonor or mock God, religious beliefs, or anything considered sacred. Here are a few examples:  Speaking disrespectfully about God: Saying things like ""God doesn‚Äôt exist"" or using God's name in vain (e.g., saying ""God"" or ""Jesus"" as an exclamation in anger or frustration without genuine reverence).  Claiming to be God: For example, if someone were to claim that they themselves are God or have the same power and authority as God, that would be considered blasphemous in many religious contexts.  Desecrating sacred objects or places: Intentionally damaging or defiling objects or places that are considered holy, such as the Bible, church buildings, or religious relics",BubblyMuffin9376,2025-05-03T18:38:07,1

I think evangelicals want the rapture to happen because then they'll be right (and also go to eternal paradise), so they want Donald around BECAUSE they think he's the antichrist. If he is, then that means end times are coming. That's their logic anyway, I think.   Since all he cares about is power and influence, once he figured out that the evangelicals were liking him, he got his advisors to feed him more stuff to say and do. All you have to do is read the apocalyptic texts; it's all there. So he references what he's supposed to reference, and plays up all the supposed antichrist tendencies.   Anyway, Revelations is just a mix of typical psychedelic apocalyptic stuff that exists in order to tie the Bible's narrative together. If you have a beginning, you need an end. Pretty standard stuff. But it also helped the nascent followers of Jesus know when Christ would come back and have something to look forward to.

"I guess it depends on what it is teaching.  Some of the more mainline branches that lean liberal (not necessarily in politics but in interpretation) can say that the apocalyptic messages were about Rome, tyrants, and being persecuted, but not necessarily led by some 'otherworldly' hand.  The thing every Christian believes in is the concept of original sin, so it follows that some humans will do evil stuff but not because they are being influenced by Satan, or whatever, but just because of that original sin and that they have yet to find Jesus.   That 's about all I got on it.  We can go back and forth all day and get nowhere.   If God is all-knowing, omnipresent, the alpha and the omega, has a plan, and so on, then it is all kinda mute, anyways.  The only things I can think of that may speak to your comment are in Mathews where it is written that no one, not even Jesus or the angles, knows when God is going to cash it all in, and in Acts where it basically says that it is none of your business to know when the end times will come.   I will say that Christians in general are taught to not accept, or at least to not welcome, the antichrist.  You are supposed to be vigilant and strong and stand up to them.  Johns says that 'many antichrists HAVE come', as in past tense, alluding to there being many more to come in the future, too.   Intentionally brining on the end-times is generally thought to be a bad idea among Christians, as I wrote, above.  But I suppose it comes down to the specific church or religious leader.  This is more akin to cult behavior, and I am not accusing Evangelicals of being a cult--yet they do seem to straddle the line on the fringes-- and like a cult they do focus on end-times, a lot, it seems.",crucial_geek,2025-05-04T21:40:28,1

"If that‚Äôs how Evangelical Christianity is defined, no I am not Evangelical. However, Evangelical Christianity is technically a movement that is not necessarily denominational, but includes denominations like Methodist, Lutheran, Baptist, etc with a lot of diverse beliefs that include liberal/progressive ideologies. At face value it is not political, it‚Äôs more about the Bible and believing in Christ with an emphasis on missions. One example of this is Southern Baptists who split over Baptists related to slavery, but Martin Luther King himself was a Baptist pastor who believed the exact opposite. At one point, however, they were all Baptist and both identify as Evangelical. The issue is mainly people who identify as Christian, but lobby hard with tunnel vision on specific issues, elevating them using the Bible out of context. It‚Äôs incredibly problematic because the actual Bible shows Jesus as really liberal and constantly debating the religious conservative folk at the time, Pharisees.
