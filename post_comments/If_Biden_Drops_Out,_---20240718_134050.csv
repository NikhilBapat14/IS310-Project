"Aoc said in her instagram live that, yes there are legal issues. She went on to say, that if the candidate is Kamala this will minimize such issues; but if a different candidate/aside from Kamala were chosen, this would cause issues like this to be more serious, which these problems might in turn be resolved by the supreme court, something that Democrats do not wish for.   This makes sense to me.. surely if Joe Biden passed away, his VP, Kamala,'s appearance on the ballet would be the ONLY conscionable thing to do, regardless of a 'deadline' that might have passed.  However, if the ticket is thrown away entirely, AOC says Republicans are already positioned to purse legal action.",spellcasters22,2024-07-22T01:09:43,1
"I don't think there are any deadlines that have passed yet, but there are some that will pass before the Democratic convention happens.  Historically, it's been normal for the major party candidates to be granted a waiver so that they can submit their candidates after the deadline if necessary. (It's not unusual for either party to have a convention after the earliest states' deadlines.) This year, in Ohio, the Republican Secretary of State decided to deny the Democrats that waiver. That issue was later resolved by the Ohio legislature, who ended up moving the deadline to September--but the Democratic Party decided that they shouldn't give the Republicans any further chances to mess with them, and moved their vote to confirm the Democratic nominee to before the original Ohio deadline, which was in early August. The Democrats now plan to vote to confirm their nominee at the end of July, which will now be Harris. That should be before any deadlines have passed.  Even with that happening, the Republicans have made it clear that they plan to file whatever legal challenges they can on the new candidate. It's not clear what criteria they'd use to challenge. They're unlikely to succeed, but it's not impossible they come up with some weird loophole that nobody knew about. (But if that's the case, they probably could have used it to challenge Biden's inclusion on the ballot too.)",anneoftheisland,2024-07-23T22:46:22,1
