Remember all the Pulitzer for Russia hoax? ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-03T08:54:11,242
These awards mean nothing anymore.  All credibility to them has been compromised and eroded. The same can be said for journalism and cinema,BattleIllustrious680,2025-05-03T08:56:32,152

The libs are defiant. They are trying to stick it to Trump for calling them out for their fake news. This is how we know fake news is not going to change from faking news or even try to rebuild their credibility. In fact after this they will double down on their fake news.,octaviobonds,2025-05-03T16:58:30,0

"Dan Rather got a lifetime achievement award after peddling painfully obvious fake documents because he was trying to smear a Republican. All these awards are just self-masturbatory recognitions of the ""correct"" group think.",ngoni,2025-05-03T11:48:31,57
"Yeah, in context, this is a huge dig at 60 minutes.",Kahnspiracy,2025-05-03T10:45:55,54
I can’t help but think that it’s genuinely a jab at their team. “Best liars!” Backhanded compliment. I love it.,My_Big_Black_Hawk,2025-05-03T12:35:27,8
