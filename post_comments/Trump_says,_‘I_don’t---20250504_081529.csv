"He has done this all his life, but pre politics, he got away with it because everyone either worked for him or was in a lower position of power.  His biggest problem as a pol, other than the criming, is that he doesn't understand building a coalition or needing allies for more than six minutes.  But for daddy's, and Putin's, $$$ and a cult base of dangerous morons, he'd be selling used cars in the midwest and trying to evade his child support payments.",StandupJetskier,2025-05-04T12:26:55,9

"So the Gravy Seals types won’t cut the mustard lol. But what’s sad is if it comes down to it, the rank and file will follow orders and do their lethal duty. Don’t want to shoot or get shot by my brothers and sisters, my countrymen. My only hope is service members truly live up to their oath and object. It’s terrifying to imagine this scenario.",MasterDump,2025-05-04T15:39:11,1

I think he did it because he is stupid enough and vain enough to believe that makes him exempt from the Constitutional commitment. It does not. Abraham Lincoln got sworn in on a Law Book.,Shopfiend,2025-05-06T13:05:26,1

"Heritage has been all over this for a decade and that why he calls 2020 a stolen election. He just missed jail/prison by a heartbeat and I hope he paid both women the money he owes them.

It’s the only reason I could think of why he didn’t put his hands on the bible and cross his legs while taking the oath. Unless he would burst into flames if he touched the bible.,No_Vacation8347,2025-05-04T17:34:38,2
