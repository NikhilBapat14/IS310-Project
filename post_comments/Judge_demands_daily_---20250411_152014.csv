Keep harassing them. That prison in El Salvador that people are being sent to is brutal,kerryfinchelhillary,2025-04-11T15:36:05,25

"I've heard it's bad. Hardened criminals are shipped there. Hopefully, they keep the legal immigrants separately but I doubt that's happening. Who knows how many people were shipped there? The poor student from Tufts University was taken to Louisiana (where she still is) and they took her green card away. They definitely don't want us to what's going on because it is beyond legal.",Ipreferthedark,2025-04-11T20:01:43,5
I think he’s absolutely alive and they’re terrified of what he’s going to say in interviews when they eventually have to cough him up.,gringledoom,2025-04-11T17:22:31,5
"Why do you think he’s “absolutely alive”? What evidence is there? I’m not saying he is dead, but I’m wondering what gives you so much confidence.",Successful_Order2143,2025-04-11T18:48:20,4
I personally don't know if he is alive. If he is alive and well why haven't they released yet? I really hope he gets returned to his family.  This whole thing is insane! I do not think all those men in black clothes and masks were ICE. Did they ever announce who they were and had a badge on them to prove who they were? It all seems so shady and we need him out ASAP before he does more damage. He is the one who belongs in prison.,Ipreferthedark,2025-04-11T20:12:57,2
