If Isham can't follow the law herself she certainly doesn't need to be on the bench enforcing it for others. She should be relieved immediately for she cannot be trusted to uphold the law in the cases that come before her court. There's no way this woman can be impartial.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-27T07:17:07,328
Ok. Impeach her for dereliction of duty and bring in someone else. Done. 👍🏻,ITrCool,2025-04-27T07:26:55,252

"The Democrats are back with their ""It's the end of Democracy"" pitch for this. Because despite their claims of no one being above the law, judges should be able to break laws when they feel like it. So arresting judges for blatantly breaking laws is now the end of Democracy.",PartyOfFore,2025-04-27T08:16:48,61

"Wow, a judge protesting before there’s even a trial.

"A biased judge threatening to not show up?  Praise Jesus!  Also, why isn’t she patiently waiting for the “due process” that the other crook is getting to play out.

"This is the first time I've seen the details of what Dugan actually did, and it's worse than I thought.  It's also an _extremely_ clear violation of [1324(a)](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1907-title-8-usc-1324a-offenses), including multiple counts of aiding, abetting, harboring, with a mandatory minimum of three-years imprisonment.  And that's just the alien side of it.  There's also interference charges, obstruction, luring officers to a location, etc.  I don't know who the next president is going to be, but Dugan will definitely be behind bars when they're sworn in.  > Federal agents from ICE, FBI, CBP and DEA attempted to arrest the undocumented male – Mexican national Eduardo Flores-Ruiz – following his scheduled criminal court appearance before Dugan on April 18 to face three misdemeanor battery charges for allegedly beating two people.  > Dugan demanded that the officers proceed to the chief judge’s office and – after his hearing ended – escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a restricted jury door, bypassing the public area where agents were waiting in order to help him avoid arrest, per the complaint.  Just imagine how smug and clever Dugan was feeling as she closes the side door behind Ruiz, and the group of Officers are standing still around in her office waiting for him to arrive or something.  She walks in like ""Sorry boys, can't find him anywhere! Tee hee!"" _(Sure got one over on them!  Viva la resistance!, tee hee!)_.",Ghosttwo,2025-04-27T12:53:45,1

And half the problem is she does believe it's *her* courtroom. It's not - it's the people's courtroom.    These progressive judges act like these courtrooms are their own personal fiefdoms.
