"The whole case is a joke. Here's a summation of the whole affidavit:  ""An FBI accountant with the White-Collar Crimes Squad, which investigates public corruption crimes, civil rights crimes, and financial crimes (none of which have anything to do with ICE deportations of illegals) who was not present during the events alleges that officers involved in the arrest reported to them that the courtroom deputy for Dugan's courtroom left his post and came directly to them specifically to allege that attorney A told Dugan's clerk something who then allegedly told Dugan something who then according to various other witnesses allegedly acted in a way that allegedly was to undermine the arrest of Flores-Ruiz""  The whole account is so tenuous on so many levels.  1) It was only an administrative warrant, and were told by multiple people at the courthouse they were not allowed to be anywhere in the courthouse that wasn't public unless they were directed there by staff. Despite that they ignored those instructions multiple times. They also chose not to reveal their presence in full nor their identities (only some officers were identified).  2) The key witness is an employee of the court who very obviously made a beeline to the officers to make allegations against his superior, while on duty, and abandoning his post. I'd question the shit out of his character and if I was the court I'd fire him, or threaten to fire him if he doesn't recant. He sounds like a racist MAGA zealot, and if attorneys could look into his social media and character witnesses I think you could prove pretty readily that he was acting purely out of prejudice.  3) The only other viable witness is an assistant DA who basically didn't have much to say other than to complain about the case being adjourned and speculating about the reason.  4) The chain of hearsay is 6 people long...Case manager says officers said deputy said attorney A said to clerk who said to Dugan.  5) The entire case hinges on judging Dugan's intent which is both unknowable and also unrecorded.  6) At NO POINT in the complaint does it refer to any evidence whatsoever other than witness statements and hearsay about statements. No video or audio recordings. No written testimonies from any of the ""guilty"" actors. It's all hearsay.  7) Finally, it was the decision of ICE ERO to arrest him at the courthouse WITHOUT NOTIFYING THEM IN ADVANCE OR ASKING PERMISSION, a decision that was made solely because it was ""easy"" and ""safe"" for the officers. Essentially, they hijacked the legitimate business of the courthouse to make their jobs easier and safer, without cooperating with the courthouse in advance, nor a plan of action in light of having an administrative warrant, showing that the officers nor their superiors understood the legality of administrative warrants vs judicial warrants. ICE ERO could have simply arrested him at work, at home, tracked his phone, etc. in order to effect an arrest. But no, they chose SPECIFICALLY to only arrest him at the courthouse, making the fault for the incident theirs entirely.  In my opinion, the specific choice to make the venue of arrest the courthouse was done for the exact outcome that occurred, a showdown between feds and judges. They're instigating unnecessary conflict with state courts in order to legitimize a total crackdown on state rights and power. If anything Trump and his administration don't actually care that much about the deportations, they're just using them as a way to ignite conflict with the states. That way they can completely disarm and cripple state and judicial power in order to effect nationwide federal takeover. All the while MAGGATs support the whole endeavor because they mistakenly see what's happening as an attack on illegal immigrants, when it's actually an attack on the states.",MisanthropicHethen,2025-04-28T05:10:45,11

"Can someone submit this:  # I. Obstruction Statutes Require a Direct Causal Connection  It is settled law that obstruction of justice requires more than merely influencing circumstances around an enforcement action — it requires a **""nexus""** or **direct causal connection** between the defendant’s conduct and an adverse impact on an official proceeding.  In **United States v. Aguilar**, 515 U.S. 593 (1995), the Supreme Court held that a defendant must **knowingly engage** in conduct that has the **natural and probable effect** of interfering with an official proceeding.  Similarly, in **Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States**, 544 U.S. 696 (2005), the Court emphasized that even acts that ""impede"" must be **linked** closely to an identifiable proceeding and have a **substantial likelihood of influencing** it.  Thus, **intervening discretionary actions** by enforcement agents — such as an election not to arrest — **break the chain of causation** and preclude criminal liability.  # II. The Independent Conduct of ICE Agents Breaks the Causal Chain  According to the criminal complaint and public reports:  * ICE agents **knew** of Flores-Ruiz’s presence. * Agents **encountered him** in the public hallway after exiting Judge Dugan’s courtroom. * **At least one agent shared an elevator ride** with Flores-Ruiz. * Despite having lawful authority and opportunity, **agents elected not to arrest him immediately** inside the courthouse. * Flores-Ruiz was subsequently apprehended outside the courthouse.  This independent decision by law enforcement officers **constitutes an intervening cause** that defeats any claim that Judge Dugan’s conduct was the proximate cause of obstruction.  See, e.g., **United States v. Montague**, 29 F.4th 601, 608 (8th Cir. 2022) (""If an independent act breaks the causal link between the defendant’s conduct and the obstructed proceeding, criminal liability cannot attach."").  # III. Judicial Independence and Due Process Require Caution in Charging Judges  Prosecuting a sitting judge for case management decisions — such as directing a litigant through a courthouse exit — raises profound constitutional concerns about judicial independence under Article III and Due Process principles.  Where a judge’s actions are at most **indirect** and **where enforcement agents maintained full operational discretion**, charging obstruction threatens to **chill judicial administration** without adequate justification.  The doctrine of **""absolute immunity""** for judicial acts is not directly at issue here, but the same caution animates the principle that a judge’s **routine courtroom management decisions** must not easily be criminalized absent clear, direct causal evidence.  See **Forrester v. White**, 484 U.S. 219 (1988).",This-Layer-4447,2025-04-28T19:34:47,2

She knew where agents were, she knew they had a warrant for the arrest of the person inside of the court room (because she inspected it herself).  So she first went outside of the court room, actively rounded up the agents waiting to arrest the suspect and then diverted them to the Chief Justice's office.  Then she went back to her court room, quickly/secretly adjourned the suspect's case (i.e. the prosecutor didn't even know) and then escorted the suspect through a back door.  She's under zero obligation to help ICE.  But she also cannot take steps to actively interfere in them executing a legal arrest any more than any other rando.  IMHO, if the facts of the complaint are substantiated in court, the charges (#1 Obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States, #2 Concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest) seem entirely appropriate.",tomz17,2025-04-28T00:22:19,-6

The combination of confrontation, asking and/or ordering them to speak to a person away from the courtroom, seemingly attempting to ensure that all of them were gone, and then abruptly halting the scheduling hearing to allow the defendant to exit in a nonstandard fashion away from the public all speak convincingly that obstructing their arrest efforts was intentional.",Pitiful_Dig_165,2025-04-28T04:48:52,-4

">33. After leaving the Chief Judge’s vestibule and returning to the public hallway, DEA Agent A reported that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney were in the public hallway. DEA Agent B also observed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the hallway near Courtroom 615 and noted that Flores- Ruiz was looking around the hallway. From different vantage points, both agents observed Flores- Ruiz and his counsel walk briskly towards the elevator bank on the south end of the sixth floor. I am familiar with the layout of the sixth floor of the courthouse and know that the south elevators are not the closest elevators to Courtroom 615, and therefore it appears that Flores-Ruiz and his counsel elected not to use the closest elevator bank to Courtroom 615. DEA Agent A followed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney towards the south elevator bank. At approximately 8:50 a.m., DEA Agent A alerted other members of the arrest team that DEA Agent A was on the elevator with Flores-Ruiz. While on the elevator, Flores-Ruiz and his attorney spoke to each other in Spanish, which DEA Agent A did not understand.

The governments story here is that she intended to seek and identify all arresting agents, and send them off to a separate location away from her courtroom so that she could rapidly dispense with his matter, and have the guy leave through a door into a hallway that is not typically used in this manner, all in an effort to prevent his arrest.

"There eas no hyperinflation in the early 30s Germany. I should point out that German hyperinflation was *deliberate* who wanted to crash the German economy to delay or prevent war reparations payments.  Hindenburg won the presidency in 1925 and 1932, winning in 1932 around 53% to Hitler's 37%. The problem was that the legislature remained gridlocked and ineffective while the Nazi Party onky grew. Their brownshirts terrorized opponents, Nazi newspapers acted in lockstep with candidates, and once they had a plurality, their paramilitaries were legalized...not a good move in the long run.  My point here is that if economic depression was the only cause, the Nazis would have come to power earlier. If it was Versaille, it would have been even earlier. Instead the Nazis benefitted from an ineffectual system with leadership that wanted to rule by decree, a legislative branch umable to resolve crises, and a party that increasingly expanded its propaganda and paramilitary arms until theh dominated the political sphere.",musashisamurai,2025-04-28T01:01:16,14

Sometimes the index level itself will be reported, but it is also common to see 1-month, or 12-month percent changes reported.  >In addition to the **all items** index, BLS publishes thousands of other consumer price indexes, such as **all items less food and energy**. Some users of CPI data use this index because food and energy prices are relatively volatile, and they want to focus on what they perceive to be the ""core"" or ""underlying"" rate of inflation.  So, yes, some of the reports ""cut out"" items like food and energy, but that's only because the changes in the prices of those goods can be found in another index. It doesn't mean that the average person simply doesn't have access to that information.  >But for the ruling/investor class stuff like the cost of necessities spiraling out of control being seen as unimportant to pay attention to helped lead us here.  Again these are conspiratorial, populist talking points that are all too often used to rope people into hard-right, fascist ideology.

"You said I ""claimed that the feds will only arrest people with 2 agents present"".   So to you...""some Police Chiefs"" = ""the feds""? Bye.",css555,2025-04-28T11:23:37,0
"Sorry, I saw ""Did you read it?"" and decided to stop there because I assumed that you only read the allegations in the news and took them at face value. But now I see that you are taking something from the complaint at face value. What you copied doesn't disprove what I wrote:  She didn't hide him, she didn't even gave him instructions. And again: the agents saw him! That's not hiding.  I know that the Trump administration is accusing her of crimes, but the information they provide says otherwise. If you read it thoroughly you'll see that two agents saw him in the public hallway, that she didn't try to hide him and that she didn't give him any instructions in order to help him escape.",washingtonu,2025-04-28T18:31:15,1
"According to the complaint she directed Flores-Ruiz to exit through the jury door while they were going to leave through the normal exit saying "" wait, come with me"" before escorting them through the jury door. Even if her attempt at helping him was poor it was still a attempt",ber808,2025-04-28T18:47:56,1
"""wait, come with me"" is not enough to prove the felonies they accuse her of and it's not even an attempt of anything. Especially not when she directed them through a door that goes to *the public hallway where the agents was standing*",washingtonu,2025-04-28T19:07:50,1
"How so? She knew if he excited through his orignal path that was 100% going to have ice on that side, the jury door leads to a non public area with from my understanding a different exit. From the complaing it also appears she tried to gather ice to one area. We honestly dont know enough yet but it seems her arrest was warranted",ber808,2025-04-28T19:10:36,1
">from my understanding  Two agents saw him in the **public hallway**. It did not lead to a non public area with a different exit, because of it did those two agents wouldn't have been able to see him in the public hallway, follow him through the public hallway and then one of them took the elevator with him.  >but it seems her arrest was warranted  They need to have probable cause for 18 U.S.C. § 1505 and 18 U.S.C. § 1071, I suggest that you go through some case law, you'll see that it isn't warranted to arrest someone because they directed someone out via a door that the government didn't like.",washingtonu,2025-04-28T19:46:45,1
The jury door in this case leads to a non public area and then yes to a public hallway where he was seen   They appear to have probable cause for both lol for what reason did she direct Flores-Ruiz to exit through a exit that is by no means the norm for a defendant?,ber808,2025-04-28T21:13:37,1
