"""wherever they are found in the United States, including, but not limited to, inside Alien Enemies'   residences and workplaces. Prior to entering an Alien Enemy's residence to apprehend an Alien   Enemy, officers must have reason to believe the validated Alien Enemy is present inside the   residence"" - that's the relevant part for anyone interested.  So it's someone labeled an 'alien enemy' not regular illegal immigrants.",Merax75,2025-04-26T01:32:44,1
"Copying my comment from elsewhere:   >Cops have always been able to enter your home without a warrant under certain circumstances, including hot pursuit of a criminal, for public safety, and to arrest the subject of a warrant known to be in the home (with some caveats). ICE policy is rather restrictive when it comes to warrantless entries for administrative arrests. This new memo makes ICE policy less restrictive when pursuing very specific aliens for administrative arrests. It's still more restrictive than the Constitution and case law allow.   Cops don't need a warrant to enter a home if they attempt to arrest someone outside a home and that person flees into the home.    Cops don't need a warrant to enter a home if someone in the home is shooting at people or attacking others in the home.   Cops don't need a warrant to enter a home if they have a warrant to arrest a person in the home and that person would be able to escape if the cops left to get a warrant.   ICE policy has generally prohibited ICE officers from utilizing these common exceptions to the warrant rule to enter a home to make an administrative arrest. This memo is saying that ICE officers are now allowed to use these common exceptions to the warrant requirement to enter a home to make an administrative arrest if they have reason to believe that an identified Tren de Aragua member that they have a warrant for is in the home. This does not apply to all illegal aliens. This doesn't mean that ICE can just spot check homes door to door looking for illegal aliens.    You are being manipulated by the media.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-25T23:37:07,-66

I’m no legal expert so I may be wrong on this. It seems to me that the home entering works in a similar way to probable cause. The officer can enter the home of an “alien enemy” if they believe that there is an “alien enemy” within the home.   The memo also states that this “reactive” way of apprehending is not the primary method of apprehending an “alien enemy” and that whenever possible the normal form of apprehension via warrants should be used.,Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-25T23:43:42,-33

It's deliberately misleading.  Immigration laws are not the same as criminal laws.  Not being required to have a criminal warrant has been this way for a very long time.  It all hinges on reasonable suspicion just like a criminal case.
