There's an election in Canada on Monday.  Elections Canada already knows who's a citizen and who isn't because it's a non-partisan part of the Canadian government.  [These are forms of ID ](https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&document=index&lang=e) accepted in order to vote.  This is how functioning democracies work.  Your country is fucking embarrassing.,incide666,2025-04-24T18:07:17,11
Courts are finally at least appearing to do something.  We'll see what the Supreme Court does with this when it gets that far.,jakktrent,2025-04-24T17:38:28,8
Trump really listens to and accepts the courts.,RiseDelicious3556,2025-04-24T17:56:17,2
Does the Supreme court want to appear really stupid? They may want to salvage some respectability for the regime change.,NoReserve7293,2025-04-24T17:46:34,4

By slowing down you mean it's doing nothing?  Trumps team told the court they would hold off on deportations and while saying that immediately sent planes deporting people away to el Salvador to continue to deport people like it's slowing nothing he doesn't wait for the court order to be challenged he just keep it going regardless.  Worth mentioning that the people enacting trumps plans are not the same people dealing with the legal issues.,LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:56:24,1
