Is that really a news? The state has been taking the taxes of illegal immigrants for decades without allowing them to be security or benefits from these taxes.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-01T10:09:48,1
"Eh, I'm pro-immigrant. This is not really a compelling argument.  The people targeting undocumented immigrants don’t care about things like Social Security contributions. You’re not going to change their minds with stats like that. Also:  > Legal immigrants and many undocumented workers without employment authorization pay Social Security taxes, analyses show. Some undocumented immigrants use fake Social Security numbers or ones they may have had before their work permits lapsed.  I also deal a lot with systems and structural organization and practices. Even if there’s a benefit, like helping fund Social Security, it’s a mess to rely even remotely on contributions that come from stuff like this or really any other byproduct of something functioning outside of the defined system. That’s not sustainable practice. Building arguments around it just sets you up for bigger headaches later.",BeltOk7189,2025-05-01T08:52:01,-2
"The right wing has made this argument. “I’m not anti immigrant, but these people keep coming here and we can’t afford to support everyone.” When in reality we don’t support them, they pay in to services they will never receive. It’s not an argument that it’s all okay. It’s a rebuke of the argument built by the right wing that immigrants are freeloaders on us.",Beneficial_Dish8637,2025-05-01T09:30:39,10
"For a rebuke to be effective, their original argument has to be made in good faith.",BeltOk7189,2025-05-01T09:33:47,-3
"They say nothing at all in good faith, so are we supposed to let their words go unchallenged?",PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-01T10:39:45,2
"They’ve turned our impulse to challenge into a weapon. They flood the zone with bad faith arguments to exhaust us. They want us chasing every lie, half-truth, and manipulative framing.  Writing an article about how undocumented immigrants contribute to Social Security isn’t a win. It’s proof we’ve lost the plot. No one on the right is going to be swayed. It’s not a rebuttal. It's not challenging their words. It’s a distraction. It’s taking the bait and wasting our time. Worse, it drags Social Security into the mess and makes it look like a system that depends, even if just a little, on undocumented labor to stay afloat - which is a terrible argument.",BeltOk7189,2025-05-01T11:05:05,0
