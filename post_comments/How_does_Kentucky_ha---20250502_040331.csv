"I’m not from Kentucky, but Andy is the son of a former two term governor of the state. That and he seems to be very relatable probably have a lot to do with it",JustGiveMeA_Name_,2025-05-02T17:04:57,168
It’s not possible to gerrymander a governorship. Most states are closer to 50R/50D than you’d think. Even states that vote for one party very consistently can be like 60/40. Basically the last Republican governor sucked and Beshear was a great candidate who ran as a moderate Democrat.,chiefmud,2025-05-02T17:05:44,262
"Beshear has several things in his favor  1. He's the son of a popular former governor- Andy Beshear is the son of Steve Beshear who was a two term governor from 2007-2015. Before this Steve served as AG and Lt Gov in the 1980s 2. Prior history- Andy Beshear was able to show that he wasn't a ""crazy communist liberal"" by running for AG in 2015 and demonstrating that he was a strong brand in his own right 3. History of electing Democrats to the Governor's Mansion- Like states like Kansas and Montana, Democrats are no stranger to Frankfort. Of the last 50 years, Democrats have occupied the seat for 42 years. Just in the 21st century, its been 17 of the past 25 years. 4. Matt Bevin's war on teachers- Incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin, Beshear's opponent in 2019, [waged an war on the teacher's public pension system](https://time.com/5719885/matt-bevin-republican-kentucky-teacher-protests/) that led to widespread strikes and walkouts. Now Republicans may dislike the federal Department of Ed. But they love their kid's teachers. They're the good ones of course. And having the Governor strip the pension of their kid's 64 year old second grade teacher who stayed late to tutor them was a PR nightmare. 5. Andy Beshear's platform- Beshear was able to use his skills to appeal to ""common sense"" and fight for teachers and support things like Medicaid expansion that Bevin was blocking",elykl12,2025-05-02T17:16:13,119
"Beshear got into office originally because the Republican incumbent in 2019, Matt Bevin, was a complete shitshow of corruption, incompetence, and plain evil. KY had the best-in-the nation health exchange system, but that was ""Obamacare"" and Bevin campaigned on, among other things, eliminating that kind of ""socialism"", Well, rural KY voted him in, and then had their healthcare destroyed by Bevin's idiocy. He also screwed up teacher pensions in the state, and was generally a shitty human being (just look up the abuse accusations from his adopted son).  That left an opening for a reasonably popular democrat, Beshear, to hop in. He had already gotten a rep as state AG for standing up to Bevin after suing him (several times) for abuse of power. Basically, the 2020 election was a referendum and the state rejected Bevin. Beshear gained a very solid rep for being competent and decent during covid, and didn't have too much trouble staying popular with enough independents and republicans to keep the office.

"Republican politicians in power tend to become too repulsive to vote for even in states with a large Republican voter base like Kentucky and Kansas.     “The Democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter, taller, richer, and remove the crabgrass on your lawn. **The Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected and prove it.”**  (emphasis mine)  ― P.J.

"Nothing is as black and white in its red and blue as you’d think. There’s plenty of cross over and things shift and change. West Virginia up until very recently had a Democratic Senator. Massachusetts had a Republican Governor until very recently. Florida last cycle was considered a battleground still and Trump won by 3%.   Beshear is the son of Steve Beshear who was a much beloved Governor of Kentucky who has been known in Kentucky politics since the 70s and 80s and basically continuously a known name in Kentucky. And not even as like Governor from yesteryear. He was Governor up until 2015. He was the 61st Governor of Kentucky and Andy Beshear is the 63rd. In between was Matt Bevin, who while following pretty generally Republican policies, put them to the gun and ended up being basically the perfect storm for a weak candidate. There was a lot of grumbling in the state about his “right to work” laws (which despite the general GOP trend there - Kentuckians are still very mindful of the role of unions in their history), attacked teachers after he went after their pensions (in a pretty nasty way), and most of all, tried to reverse the Medicaid expansion in Kentucky. That expansion was put into place by Gov Steve Beshear and is the epitome of while general rhetoric was against Obamacare in the state, the Medicaid expansion was massively popular once in effect and was not something Kentuckians who relied on it (a lot of them) took lightly. Bevin is also an outsider which … Kentucky is the kind of place that puts a lot of emphasis on “true” sons of Kentucky. He’s from the Northeast and only moved to Kentucky in adulthood. And while not enough to prevent him from winning one term, it was an uphill battle in addition to the unpopularity of his first term agenda. But relevant, he also previously had challenged Mitch McConnell in a primary race for the Senate (who even though is Alabama born is seen as a son of Kentucky in Kentucky) which did not win him many fans among republicans or the Republican infrastructure in Kentucky.   Andy Beshear by inverse, is a Beshear before he’s a democrat in the eyes of a lot of Kentuckians. And because of that, I think was able to dodge a lot of the characterisations that make democrats hard sells among hardline republicans. As one voter said in an interview that night he was elected that was very popular for a time, they “voted for Governor Beshear’s boy” not the “Democrat”",PhiloPhocion,2025-05-02T17:28:02,6
"Wait until you see how Vermont regularly elects both Bernie Sanders, and Republican governors",Ana_Na_Moose,2025-05-02T19:14:59,5
"In addition to many other good points:   Gubernatorial elections tend to be less predictable than congressional elections, including senate elections even though they have the same electorate.   It's easier to build a brand separate from national politics when the issues are more local. A Democrat like Beshear can win mostly on the economy and good governance, just as Phil Scott can run as a sensible counterweight against Democratic spending in Vermont. Similarly, gubernatorial elections also tend to be more candidate-focused.   Compared to the 2016 election, 20 states either had a governor from the opposite party as the presidential winner or has elected one since. That can be compared to only 16 states with an opposing party senator  - despite the fact that each state has two Senators and only one governor! Only four states have had both senators from the opposing party (Pennsylvania 2023-2025, Georgia and Arizona since 2021, and Michigan since 2016). Only six states have voted differently from how it did in 2016 in either 2020 or 2024. In other words, gubernatorial elections are swingier.",Significant_Arm4246,2025-05-02T18:14:12,2
"Kentucky has elected 5 Republican governors in the last century. Its congressional districts are heavily gerrymandered for the Republicans, yes, but it also holds its gubernatorial elections in an odd off year election cycle that decreases turnout quite substantially. This off year cycle also tends to decouple the election from the other on-cycle political races. Finally, there is the ever decreasing union vote. For most of the last century, Kentucky had a significant loyalty to democrats because of the unionization of the coal mines and factories of the state (especially Appalachia). The Southern strategy took longer to take hold there because those groups were mostly voting for Democrats’ stance on labor rights unlike the Dixiecrats who a bit less savory in their affiliation with the party. As the mines have closed and the miners’ families have dwindled, that vote has also dwindled. There’s obviously more to it but that’s the simple version.  -a former Kentuckian, whose family is from Greasy Creek",jaunty411,2025-05-02T21:07:53,2

"One of the pitfalls of social studies problems is the tendency to play both sides of the chess game.  In a real competition both sides make moves.  Selecting and running a candidate is meaningless if you cannot motivate voters to go to the polls.  One advantage that Republicans have due to their particular motivation is that they are motivated politically 24/7.  Democrats tend to try to vote in major elections however every election is equally significant.  If you don't vote for Secretary of State, the person who controls how elections are run (political decisions) may not have your best interest at heart.  If you don't vote for school board, then the book burners start doing their thing.  Also if you don't pay attention to the State Legislature, you may find yourself living in a district that looks like modern art on a map.  They also do fun things like decree that one polling station should exist for every county.  Great until you consider that most cities are also a county.",Sapriste,2025-05-02T17:40:36,1
"This isn’t totally crazy, and in fact, up until rather recently was pretty normal. Each state runs its own political parties. Some state parties have long histories with the political party that you didn’t think would be in state power. That is the case with Kentucky with democrats or Bernie Sander’s Vermont, who currently has a Republican governor. These political parties also tend to buck the national party at times, think of How West Virginia’s Joe Manchin or Arizona’s Synema was often a thorn in the democrat’s side a few years back.   And probably most importantly that in many of these states, especially rural east of the Mississippi states, many representatives hail from dynastical political families, or families that have always been Republican/democrat. I remember as a kid meeting a Talmadge in a field trip to the Georgia capital, I think he was a state rep at the time, but from a family of governors. He was a Democrat, but you never would’ve guessed it.   Even though they’re not as numerous as they were in the past, or so it feels, it speaks to the strength of local politics and the power of simply pressing palms. These reps are people neighbors and colleagues or whatever, and so political affiliation may mean nothing to otherwise partisan people, because they actually know the product they’re getting.",begemot90,2025-05-02T18:18:04,1
"A lot of states considered red or purple have blue governors. This is because of gerrymandering. If the majority of the population chooses a blue governor, it stands to reason they will choose blue legislators as well, but their vote goes to their district, which has been carved up to give marginalized populations the least likely avenue towards blue representation. Kentucky, Wisconsin, and North Carolina are perfect examples.",Budget_Llama_Shoes,2025-05-03T12:11:50,1
"The Democrats began as a conservative party in the south and there are conservative Democrats in the south still. When Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, but before Roe was overturned, Louisiana attempted to further restrict abortion in their state. Legislation was introduced by a Democrat, additional Democrats worked on and helped pass the bill, and it was signed into law by then-governor John Bel Edwards (D). It was later overturned in court.   Bottom line is it's not just Kentucky, but it's also Kentucky. Southern Democrats are more progressive than their ancestors but they're at best ""southern moderate."" Some are old-school conservative. It's relative. But they're definitely not the same as, say, New York or California Democrats.",-ReadingBug-,2025-05-03T22:58:02,1

"One starting point is that voters cross the aisle more often for their vote for Governor than their votes for Senate or President.  The rest of this post simply wouldn't matter enough to matter if Beshear had run for Senate against Bevin instead - Beshear would have lost.  But they were running to be Governor (Bevin to be reelected as such).  Bevin was VERY unpopular due to education policy, whereas Beshear was the son of a popular former governor.  He made sure his policy positions were acceptable enough for Kentucky voters that the personal loathing for Bevin overcame partisan bias enough to let him win.  For reelection, substitute ""ran against unpopular incumbent"" out for ""ran as popular incumbent"".

"You've already gotten a lot of good answers, but one of the big reasons why Beshear held on and even increased his margin in 2023 was because of how he responded to local impacted communities during natural disasters that took place in his first term, including flooding in eastern Kentucky in summer 2022 (although there were sizable floods there in other summers of his term) and a spate of tornadoes that hit the western part of the state in 2021.

[He gave off a calming, positive vibe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLZiraFR3IY) during stressful times.

"This is the most comprehensive answer so far, but misses one of the biggest elements. Kentucky is one of the states that holds their gubernatorial elections in off-years.
