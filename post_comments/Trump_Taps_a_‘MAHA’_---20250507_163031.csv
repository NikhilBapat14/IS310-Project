"Look it up, she’s not even licensed in California. Appears nowhere on their DCA license search.   Edit: she is not a licensed physician as she never completed a residency. How can a surgeon general not be a licensed physician? Also, using the title Dr. with an MD but not licensed to practice is kinda a no-no. Let this be a reminder to always check that your healthcare providers are licensed",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T16:37:18,19

I'm surprised it's not the demon sperm covid doctor wacko.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-07T16:40:17,3
You are a doctor even if you don't do residency.   There are cases where people can operate without residency in certain moonlighting positions. But it's not so common.   Casey Means is a doctor who has genuinely been trying to make people healthier. She's got a book and all.   I'm not so sure what's the big deal. She dropped out of her surgical residency. Those can be 7 yrs long.,pickledplumber,2025-05-07T16:58:19,-5
"This is kinda true in like Mississippi and some programs for foreign medical grads. Many of which have completed specialization training outside the US. While technically it’s possible if you treat anyone and use the title Dr without holding a license, you are definitely operating illegally unless someone is supervising you. Also moonlighting requires a license, never heard of any moonlighting gig that would let people with degrees and no licenses to work, or the country would be filled with international grads that are locked out due to limited residency positions.   No license means no real consequences to her actions. So who is willing to put their license on the line and supervise her",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T16:59:33,6
"Point is, you have to be licensed to practice medicine independently. What’s the point of a surgeon general if she can’t even prescribe someone a simple face ointment",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T17:03:51,3

"https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903  She had a license, she stopped practicing. It says so on her wiki.",pickledplumber,2025-05-07T17:04:51,0
I don't think the surgeon general ever does that. The job is about giving the public the information that would best help their health.   It's like Dr. Sanjay Gupta.,pickledplumber,2025-05-07T17:07:22,0
"Okay then let’s see her get it back then. Nobody really willingly lets their license lapse, they’re not difficult to maintain other than minimal online CME classes",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T17:06:51,3

"At least he finished residency and had independent practicing responsibilities, also he is still licensed in Georgia. To think someone would know healthcare when they never really stared a patient in the face and had to come up with a treatment plan without the pillow of their attending’s license or the hospital’s GME program backing them up is a little wild. I mean, who is she to be telling people everyday what to do, because she’s not certainly seeing the outcomes or the nuances.   Also I know that’s not what they do, just a point that she had never fully practiced medicine and is now an expert on something she never did. Postgraduate training is not independent practice",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T17:12:07,7
"She's an alt-med kook, so she's in the business of dispensing ineffective medical advice for profit.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-07T17:17:06,4
"Her job today is that of an educator. She writes books, articles, goes on shows and podcasts and news segments.   Her having a medical license doesn't make her knowledge more valuable.",pickledplumber,2025-05-07T17:09:24,0
"So all doctors have an internship here which they essentially go around to all the different fields trying things. The last two years of medical school are spent in the hospital doing direct patient care   I think it's pretty ridiculous to say that because you didn't complete residency, you don't have experience with patients. That's not how the US medical system works. In fact, the last 2 years of medical school, internship year or years and the beginning of residency is where you gain your experience dealing with patients.   Especially given that she was a surgery resident. She would have worked with other residents to come up with treatment plans and propose them to their attendings. It's literally what they do every week. The learning is in the doing.",pickledplumber,2025-05-07T17:22:44,3
And you know that to be true how? She's the one with the education and I imagine that both you and I don't have medical educations.,pickledplumber,2025-05-07T17:24:46,2
She is unfit to be surgeon general. She is a quack.  In no fucking world other than trump dementia MAGAstan is she qualified to be surgeon general.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-07T18:11:23,2
"I know, I went through it. As did my classmates and my friends, and coworkers. Nobody would agree we know the healthcare system until we are out on our own facing the responsibilities of our actions treating patients on our own.   I don’t really need it explained to me, I know what the limitations of stopping would be at any step along the way to a full license. And no, the answer isn’t because I was a bad student or anything, you really can’t know what that responsibility feels like without practice, and then to tell other people how they should practice when you haven’t done so yourself is beyond comprehension. I would not be at all inclined to tell an engineer how something should be engineered just because my undergrad degree was in engineering. I never worked as one, and I can give my opinion but should leave the engineering to the real engineers working that field everyday, of which I am not",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T17:27:24,5
"RFk Jr is a an unqualified and dangerous crank.  If he has a high opinion of her, that's enough for me to know she's also a kook.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-07T17:32:16,2
She spouts pseudoscientific nonsensical typical wellness influencer garbage. It flies in the face of evidence based doctors i.e. actual science.      Plenty of people with medical educations have called her out.,Anthony-Richardson,2025-05-07T19:14:00,0
