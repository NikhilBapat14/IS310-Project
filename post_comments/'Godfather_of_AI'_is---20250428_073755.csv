"Why does it seem pretty much everyone is scared that AI will take over the world or become some sort of Skynet or such.  First of all AI is still not even sentient, let alone thinking. The complexity of the programming is still mired in what we humans can make it do. Even the learning AIs are no where near sentient.  As far as I see, AIs are no better than a more complex version of Talking Eliza.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T10:18:37,5
