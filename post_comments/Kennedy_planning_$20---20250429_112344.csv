"I have cancer.  RFK has killed millions in grant funding for medical research, including cancer clinical trials.  There is a non-trivial chance him and Trump are the reason I don't survive this decade.  Fuck those evil assholes.",dsteffee,2025-04-29T11:25:35,52
"> The campaign will seek to address Americans' chronic health problems by inspiring them to ""take control of their health” and pledge to adopt healthier habits like eating well and exercising, according to the document. The campaign will also create a fitness challenge expanding the Presidents’ Youth Fitness program to adults.  There’s something there that, *in a vacuum*, is a good idea.  If HHS were to launch a large wellness campaign, it’d probably do some good.  But because it’s run by a fucking crockpot who thinks the cure for autism is working in the fields, you have to ask what the catch is.",ScotTheDuck,2025-04-29T11:29:41,17

"What does this even mean?  Forgetting the fact that conservatives flipped their shit when Michelle Obama tried to have the same initiative. My question is in terms of the HHS, what does this mean?  If you want people to take back their health make access to quality healthcare more available. The barrier of entry to have preventative and sick care is still too high and for some insurmountable.  You want good nutrition?   Stop allowing garbage to be introduced to our food supply.   Make nutritious food cheap.  Stop allowing companies to market their garbage to children and teens.  This isn’t rocket science. You can’t take back your health when it’s practically impossible for many. Much of this is economics and psychological manipulation. Fix those issues and people will start living healthier lives.",hmr0987,2025-04-29T12:16:14,5

Didn't the Republicans claimed it was governmental overreach of a totalitarian state when Michelle Obama vaguely tried to do the same ?,Sardanapalm,2025-04-29T12:07:56,14
"Here's the thing: when Democrats launched similar campaigns to try to educate Americans on why eating healthy was a good idea, conservatives lost their GODDAMN MINDS about it. Called it Marxism (of course) and worse.  So where's the outrage now?",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-29T13:23:21,7
"Does RFK SERIOUSLY think the reason American's have chronic health issues is because they DON'T KNOW that they should be eating better and exercising?? Sorry about the yelling but this initiative is both insulting and infuriating. Like, let's make major cuts to public health and then run an ad campaign and BOOM problem solved?!",Kincherk,2025-04-29T19:15:11,1
"Nah I'm still hung up on how much they attacked Michelle Obama for kinda sorta suggesting kids eat more fruit and vegetables and move around a little more, but now they've got this guy. If I was Michelle I'd start showing up at this guy's events like I was asked to be there.",DiceMadeOfCheese,2025-04-29T12:37:28,2
"Honestly, this is just window dressing: it means fuck all. $20m would be like a month's worth of advertising on a few big networks. This isn't going to make a dent at all.  But it is good virtue signaling! It allows RFK Jr to pretend that he's not just about antivaxxing and defunding research, he also *wants you to eat healthy*, which is all his fans will remember.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-29T13:25:41,2
Well he said he would but no progress on that end  I agree those ads need to go immediately. They're in anime format now!,MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-29T11:46:50,1
They use their intelligence to provide ideas they know are false but it gives them attention they can’t get on their own… in the private sector  So evil as shit,stjohns_jester,2025-04-29T11:42:01,18
