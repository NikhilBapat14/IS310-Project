"After passing the Inflation Reduction Act, congress went to their home districts for a few weeks. They will come back after Labor Day but will leave to campaign sometime in late September or early October.   So there's no progress in large part because everyone's back home (or using the time for vacation) and it's hard to get progress when no one is in DC actively negotiating and working through things.  It's too soon to call it dead. When Congress comes back they'll only have a few weeks of legislating before the election and we'll see what they do with it.  Edit: to add extra context, The US government uses October 1st as the ""new year"" for budgeting. That means there are still several departments that need funding or would shut down Oct 1st. This could be a quick ""delay it till after November"" or it could be dragged out because they can not have a single senate defector. Joe Manchin is wanting to put a permitting reform package in it, and a few progressives have complained. Permitting reform means quicker environmental studies and less chances to cancel a big project, so easier to build oil pipelines but also easier to build wind and solar farms. AOC has supported something like it since it makes green infrastructure much cheaper, so hopefully progressives don't make this a big deal. But if Democrats can hold together an not fight, there may be time to work on RMA in that period too. Otherwise it may be a struggle to keep the lights on before September ends.",auandi,2022-08-26T16:13:07,26
It should be brought to the floor for a vote to put everyone on record before the midterms.,ArcherChase,2022-08-26T13:19:51,12
You basically answered your own question. There aren’t 10 Republicans in favor of it. The Republican Party is blocking the Respect Marriage Act.,dunpyklungo,2022-08-26T22:36:16,2
I don’t think it will pass the senate. Unless the senate overturns the filabuster they need 60 votes to ask for closure which starts voting on the bill. This is something that has been used more in the last decade than it was previously because in 2012 the Senate changed it he rule which had required actual talking to be taking place on the floor to filabuster a bill. Now they just need to say they are and that delays the vote by 2 days and they can repeat this infinitely. It was supposed to free floor time up for other bills but it ended up making it impossible to go to a vote on almost anything.,Decent_Historian6169,2022-08-27T08:16:14,2
