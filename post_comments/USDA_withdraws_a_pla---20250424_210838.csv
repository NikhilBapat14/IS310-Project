"I worked on this problem with the USDA. It‚Äôs technically hard to do.   The basic preferred strategy is to test the chicken poo. If you find salmonella, you assume that they all are infected. Then you either send them all to a cook house, or give them all antibiotics.   The problem is that standard tests don‚Äôt work well on chicken poo. It has too much ammonia which interferes with the chemistry. New tests that get around this have been slow to come online.   The alternative is to give all chickens antibiotics. Long term, that is a very bad idea.   So, we basically have to keep the old system in place for now, where we just assume that 30% of chickens have salmonella. We have to wait for the technology to improve.",_GD5_,2025-04-25T06:17:43,4
