"I worked on this problem with the USDA. It’s technically hard to do.   The basic preferred strategy is to test the chicken poo. If you find salmonella, you assume that they all are infected. Then you either send them all to a cook house, or give them all antibiotics.   The problem is that standard tests don’t work well on chicken poo. It has too much ammonia which interferes with the chemistry. New tests that get around this have been slow to come online.   The alternative is to give all chickens antibiotics. Long term, that is a very bad idea.   So, we basically have to keep the old system in place for now, where we just assume that 30% of chickens have salmonella. We have to wait for the technology to improve.",_GD5_,2025-04-25T06:17:43,4

"“with no meaningful impact on public health.”  Uhhhhh. Only the US brags about killing their customers. No other country in the orld has such a huge issue with salmonella as the US. It's the school shootings of agriculture.  >[Foodborne Salmonella infections](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=77908) impose an estimated **$3.7 billion each year** in the United States in medical costs, wages lost from time away from work, and societal willingness to pay to prevent deaths.  >[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that *Salmonella* is responsible for 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20Salmonella%20bacteria%20cause,%2C%20fever%2C%20and%20stomach%20cramps.). Food is the source of most of these illnesses, and the [Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration estimates that over 23% of foodborne *Salmonella* illnesses are due to eating chicken and turkey](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/pdf/P19-2019-report-TriAgency-508.pdf).
