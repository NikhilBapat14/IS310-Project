"Not only should jail time be given, but also a complete payback of the entire $360,000.  Every person caught taking benefits fraudulently like this needs to be liquidated to pay the money back.",Craigmandu,2025-04-15T07:12:39,119
"Federal prosecutors said Mavious Redmond, 54, of Austin, Minnesota, continued to collect her deceased mother’s social security retirement benefits for 25 years after her mother’s death in January 1999, collecting more than $360,000 in payments.  Shame on you Mavious, now get a job to pay the USA back!  Even if you are in jail, get a job as a trustee!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-15T07:16:14,47

To think that Michelle King and other long-time SSA employees quit to prevent fraud within SSA from being uncovered.,triggernaut,2025-04-15T07:19:14,24

I got downvoted into oblivion during the campaign for saying benefits fraud is an entire cottage industry. Large groups of people have figured out ingenious ways to very blatantly defraud the government but somehow never get caught. Hopefully connecting more systems together will make the blatant fraud more difficult at least.,ngoni,2025-04-15T19:35:02,1
Does that number include the calculated interest on the amount over the 25 years she stole it?,AutomatedTexan,2025-04-15T07:26:48,41
"Most funeral homes report deaths to the SSA to prevent this kind of fraud.  It's probably worth looking into why this didn't happen in this case to see if there was any collusion, which has happened in the past.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-15T09:44:01,23
"You've probably noticed the pattern here that Democrats tend to not explicitly legalize crime, but they systemically turn a blind eye to it.  Whether it's illegal immigration with absurdly drawn out waits for hearings, various entitlement frauds, progressive NGO funded prosecutors letting criminals off, mostly peaceful but fiery protests without prosecution, or misdemeanor shoplifting not being prosecuted, the theme is clear - enabling crime from Democrat voting blocs.",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-15T09:57:04,17
"That’s proven in the Feeding our Future fraud.   https://www.americanexperiment.org/feeding-our-future-keith-ellison-caught-on-tape/  In 2022, AG Keith Ellison (Dem), said he had been “deeply involved,” in holding these fraudsters accountable. The audio in the linked article is from 2021, where the fraudsters were alleging racism due to not receiving their funding which they were stealing from the government, to which Ellison replied, “Of course, I’m here to help…Let’s go fight these people.”  Ellison not only appears to be helping these people, but he also accepted campaign donations from them. As did his son who is a local politician, as did Ilhan Omar. It’s all right there on tape.",sunkenship13,2025-04-15T10:33:56,10
