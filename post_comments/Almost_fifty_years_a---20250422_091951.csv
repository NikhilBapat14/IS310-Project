"The youngest member of the College of Cardinals is a 45 year old Ukrainian priest Francis appointed Cardinal in December. It's exceedingly unlikely he'd be elected Pope, but it is possible.",Voltage_Z,2025-04-22T09:34:56,193
There’s a Filipino cardinal in consideration. Liberal like Francis. I’m hoping for him.,HippyGrrrl,2025-04-22T09:53:45,128

That would be difficult 72% of Ukrainian Christians are Eastern Orthodox with only 9% of Ukrainian Christians being Roman Catholic. Fortunately the Vatican and the Roman Catholic church in recent years has made tremendous strides in being ecumenical as possible by reaching out to other sects of Christianity and to other religious leaders.  I really think that it would be a real honour to see a Cardinal from an unsuspecting country that has had the misfortune of being brutalized and marginalized by violence and degradation come out of the Papal Conclave as the next pontiff.,Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-22T11:59:17,5

"Actually it is more like 9% Roman Catholic. Ukraine is predominately Eastern Orthodox, but not to say that that could be an obstacle.  The Vatican in recent years has been making more and more strides towards being as ecumenical as possible and not just with the Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Churches, but also with other religious leaders from other religions.  If anything I really just hope that the fortunate individual who emerges from the Papal Conclave is willing to take on the obligation of not only caring for his flock, but also the world since lots of people not always Christian look up to the Pope for wisdom and spiritual assistance.",Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-22T12:06:17,5
"He did not „install“ people in „the group who votes“. He appointed new cardinals in the last 12 years as is his job, and cardinals over 80 are not allowed to take part in the conclave. So yes, many of the cardinals voting now were appointed by him, but this does not necessarily mean they are 100% on board with how Francis was.",neldela_manson,2025-04-22T15:32:45,5

"NBC tonight talked about how his selections seemed to be primarily expanding geographic diversity and people who are close to the poor in their communities rather than ideologically similar members of the church.    Still significantly changes who’s elected, but I don’t necessarily think it’s stacked to be a progressive by any means",Michael70z,2025-04-23T00:57:17,3
