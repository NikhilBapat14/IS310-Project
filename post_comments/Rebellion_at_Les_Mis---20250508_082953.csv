">Grenell said in a strongly worded statement that he was not aware of the boycott and that any performer “who isn’t professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won’t be welcomed.”  >“In fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they shouldn’t hire — and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience,” he said. “The Kennedy Center wants to be a place where people of all political stripes sit next to each other and never ask who someone voted for but instead enjoys a performance together.”  These fucking people. using language of tolerance to gaslight people is sickening. Whether here or any other person trying to shame others for not being tolerant of their ""political beliefs"", it isn't a political issue it is a morality issue.  The tolerant do not need to be tolerant of the intolerant. when Elon said that people take advantage of the west's empathy and that is why it is a weakness, he was projecting, like they all do.",TheParanoidPyro,2025-05-08T08:41:31,6305

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) notified us that it has withdrawn an important financial grant that would have helped support two vital cultural performances at the Paramount Theater this year: Cirque Zuma Zuma, which celebrated the traditional music, dance, and circus arts of Africa in February during Black History Month, and an Argentine tango performance coming up in September during Hispanic Heritage Month.   ﻿The NEA’s notification, sent via email, states that the federal arts agency has updated its priorities to focus on projects “prioritized by the President,” and therefore it is terminating awards that fall outside the Administration’s agenda. According to the email, the NEA’s new arts funding priorities include fostering AI competency, assisting with disaster recovery, and making America healthy again.

"It's funny, I just finished watching the HBO mini-series about the Iraq War, Generation Kill (2008), and was looking through audience reviews on rotten tomatoes out of curiosity.  There was one guy who was basically like, ""oh man, I just rewatched this for like the 10th time because I really miss when TV was this cool. Liberal pussies probably find it too offensive because it doesn't have any of that woke garbage. The language is candid and filthy, you know, just like how men used to be allowed to talk among other men.""  And I'm reading it like uh... did you comprehend any of the story too or did just like watching it because it has swear words in it?? The kicker is though, it was adapted for TV from the original non-fiction book by the guys who created The Wire--the show that literally sparked my interest in left-wing politics back when I was 18 lol.

"There have been studies done on why politically conservative people (around the world, not just the US) aren't very good at understanding humor or creating funny things. The TL;DR is they are really bad at understanding sarcasm and irony, which are pretty big components in humor.   That's not to say that everyone who harbors conservatives beliefs doesn't understand humor, it just means that conservative positions appeal to the sort of person who doesn't pick up on irony or sarcasm.

I shared a joke on Facebook once about 3 people who fight for deregulation walking in to a bar and all being poisoned by tainted booze which the regulations they killed would have prevented. This ultra conservative youth pastor went off on me saying I was celebrating the deaths of conservatives and advocating for bar tenders to poison them. I was so confused how he just missed the message that with in the joke that the deregulation they fought for was their undoing. They just don't have senses of humor which is why cruelty seems to be the only thing that makes them laugh.,Kup123,2025-05-08T14:16:41,3
