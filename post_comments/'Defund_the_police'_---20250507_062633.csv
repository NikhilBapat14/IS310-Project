"A string of shootings in Minneapolis last week left six victims dead and five others injured in just 24 hours, highlighting ""the results"" of ""years of anti-police rhetoric and failed leadership,"" 2022 Minnesota attorney general Republican nominee Jim Schultz told Fox News Digital.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T06:30:00,56

"cops need to go on strike. Yeah yeah, i know, ""it's not legal for them to do that"".  Well sir, there was this place once, a collection of what you could call colonies. The people there decided to stand their ground against what was at the time the largest military on the planet. And what they did was also considered illegal.  But it was also the right thing to do. And it got results.",ussbozeman,2025-05-07T09:15:58,2
"And this is in the state of the vice presidential candidate who wanted to disarm me. I thank god for giving me and millions of others the strength to send their bullshit packing. Had they won, the condition of the country would’ve quickly deteriorated into what Minneapolis is today, and we wouldn’t have been able to defend ourselves from those that wish to take our lives.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-07T07:00:27,49
"I live here and this is a hyperbole. Hell I haven’t even heard of these shootings. It’s definitely not a lawless city.   But the results of the riots and whatever else they did here left permanent damage. Uptown (where the riots focused) is a shell of itself. The restaurants that remained have slowly been going out of business over the last few years, and big name business (Apple/Target) skipped town years ago. Only thing it has going for it is the surplus for renters. Terribly sad because people who lived here beforehand say Uptown was the place to be to have fun.",DaDragster,2025-05-07T10:06:39,23
