"Republicans don't get it.  It may have started as a rejection of Trump. But now it is a rejection of the entire US. Trump could die tomorrow, and Canada will still reject the US. We're sick of the abusive relationship at this point.",WippitGuud,2025-04-30T17:23:32,12
"The standard Republican line for almost everything seems to be 'whatever, don't care'.",Hornpipe_Jones,2025-04-30T16:40:11,11

They don‚Äôt even care what other Americans think of him. What would they expect they‚Äôd care any more what Canadians think.,jl56649,2025-04-30T16:59:04,3

"These folks almost always dismiss anything that won't affect them directly in the short term. They can't see beyond the vast emptiness they are drowning in. But the world moves on. History will not look kindly on any of them.      And no, history will is longer be written by victors - there will be records and analyses of these pieces of shit's actions and remarks judged against true human values. History will flow free no matter how hard authoritarians will try - it is not the dark middle ages anymore.",csscp,2025-04-30T22:47:36,2

"I remember realizing the US was not to be trusted during the softwood lumber debacles when I was a child, from that point on I had the position that Canada should be pulling away and finding other trade opportunities. it certainly hasn't gotten better in the 20 years since",sluggysmalls,2025-04-30T21:43:08,2
"As an american who doesn't hate canada and spent most of my life in border states, this not only breaks my heart, but is completely terrifying. You're absolutely justified and i support you cutting off your abuser, but this is absolutely horrid. We're in for a very dark road and even if we manage to remove the regime, it'll be an entire generation before we can rebuild and recover. And our country won't look the same afterward.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-04-30T20:11:23,1
"And they‚Äôll keep that line through a recession brought about by ddar orange leader all the way to the mid-terms   Yes, yes, it‚Äôs cute that I think there will mid-terms. You‚Äôll notice that Trump keeps acting like polls and the economy matter (why else would he back down when things go wrong?)",Wise-Reference-4818,2025-04-30T16:43:41,6
Caring in this case requires you to research and form an opinion. Unless overlord tells them to say <insert stupidity> they‚Äôd rather not put in the effort.,Valyx_3,2025-04-30T16:43:12,2

"True, at least you‚Äôre one of the few Americans who can see the forest through the trees; most choose to bury their head in the sand and have turned so nihilistic they would take a nuclear threat as a ‚Äútroll‚Äù at this point. Scary shit indeed. America became a superpower due to forging strong alliances, now that many are broken who knows what‚Äôll happen?",FunBanned,2025-04-30T20:59:25,1
"I don't know. I try not to think too deeply about it because right now i have to worry about what we're going to do. My husband is a trucker and as loads dry up he's likely going to lose his job. Things have already slowed way down. We depend on his income. We need his job for medical insurance. And we're trying to build a stock of basic survival stuff since our country is getting cut off from trade. We're now staring down the barrell of empty shelves within a few weeks, and it's going to be long term. And i'm in hurricane alley so as summer approaches, that's on all our minds too. This regime has severed access to disaster aid so.. then what? It's all horrifying. And now we're losing a long standing relationship with our northern neighbors. During my time living in washington and montana, canadians were the nicest and most lovely people i met. Y'all are unlikely to ever trust us again. It's crushing.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-04-30T21:14:05,2
"I don‚Äôt harbour ill-will towards average Americans. I have many American friends; it‚Äôs the subset of your population that supports the current regime even after the constant blunders that almost seems ‚Äúalien‚Äù to me. To be so callous to the rest of the world and to view allies as ‚Äúlands to be conquered or taxed‚Äù while being the same nation that claims rejection of all imperialism under a tyrant‚Ä¶ the hypocrisy just boggles my mind; I can never listen to the ‚ÄúStar Spangled Banner‚Äù again (the only anthem other than mine that I know word-for-word) without rolling my eyes to the back of my skull due to the emptiness of the message behind the lyrics.    It‚Äôs just more heartbreaking than anything for most Canadians; we used to look up to you, many Canadians won‚Äôt admit it but it‚Äôs true that nobody held America in a higher regard than Canada; it‚Äôs sad to see it shattered.",FunBanned,2025-04-30T21:24:03,3
"All i can do is say i'm sorry, and even then those words are probably hollow to the canadians being threatened with annexation. Every day feels like a fresh nightmare down here. I hope y'all are able to stay strong and pull through whatever version of hell this causes up there. I honestly wish you nothing but the best and thank you for many years of kindness and friendship across the border.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-04-30T21:30:25,2
"Likewise, try to stay safe down there, most of us know there‚Äôs still many sane Yankees left. We know you better than any country to know you aren‚Äôt all just a bunch of MAGA-drones, this is a rough point in your history but you will pull through and this will become a national lesson that will only make your nation stronger in the future when you‚Äôre able to pull the lessons from it.  üá®üá¶ü§ùüá∫üá∏",FunBanned,2025-04-30T21:54:20,1
