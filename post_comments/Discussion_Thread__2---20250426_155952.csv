"The only reason anyone watched these things was the comedian. What's the point now?  Instead, maybe watch a classic one like [Al Franken at the 1996 dinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR7r4CXfIpU). His Al D'Amato impression kills in the room, though I doubt anyone has heard D'Amato speak in the last couple decades.",travio,2025-04-26T16:29:33,22

It's a shame Trump won't be there.  I love watching him squirm when he's the butt of the joke...,Troubled202,2025-04-26T16:31:28,9
This has been pretty fucking boring.   Nixing the comedic host was a bad move. It’s what made this annual event entertaining. Even if the host sucked.,bbjenn,2025-04-26T21:13:10,16
