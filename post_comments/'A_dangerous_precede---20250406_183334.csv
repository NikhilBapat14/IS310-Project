"It’s actually insane that the election denial in the Republican Party has gone this far. 10 years ago something like this would have been unthinkable. And if it had been attempted, you can bet it would have made headlines everywhere. Now this is just what the GOP does. This shit is SO cancerous to the country and not enough people are worried :/",BronzeRider,2025-04-06T22:48:29,17

"It’s sad that the article basically concedes that the Republican State Supreme Court Justices will act in a partisan manner if the appeal comes to them when it says that given the 5-1 Republican majority, once Riggs recuses herself, the appeal is “unlikely to change to ruling.”  It’s basically a forgone conclusion that Republican justices will disregard countless legal scholars, active and former jurists, and election experts and simply vote for their party and power.",Vuronov,2025-04-06T23:18:46,8

"1. Griffin is only challenging the ballots from three blue counties. The same ballot issues exist across the state, including the red counties. But the message is clear: It's fine if Griffin's voters have mistakes on their ballots. But the Riggs voters better not have any mistakes.   You have a problem with the ballot issues? Fine. But any challenge needs to include ALL counties and ALL ballots. You shouldn't get to pick and choose.   2. Most of the reported mistakes are not the fault of the voter. A lot of the ballot mistakes were made by the workers  entering the information into the system. So a voter spells their name correctly but the worker typing it into the system spells it wrong so you now want to invalidate that person's vote? You really think people are spelling their own names wrong? Mistakes made by election volunteers and other workers should not invalidate the vote of a person who did nothing wrong.   3. Some of the things he's challenging are rules that were in place at the time of the election. He's now saying that the rule should be changed and that should invalidate all these votes. If there's some rules you think should be changed, fine, we can have that conversation about elections going forward. But you can't go backwards and change the rules that were in place for an election that has already happened.     Riggs needs to issue the same challenge for some of the counties that Griffin won by a close margin. If Griffin is allowed to challenge some counties than Riggs should be allowed to as well. Play their game.    I live in NC (and in one of the blue counties that's being challenged). Sadly, I think the writing is on the wall and Griffin will likely end up being declared the ""winner.""   Fuck this shit.",Patient_Reach439,2025-04-07T07:43:53,3
"It is beyond time that impeachment proceedings against these ""judges"" who refuse to uphold the law are started.  The law is clear in this case, the Republicans are just trying to circumvent the law because they know they have the votes in the appellate court.  The one, really dumb, thing Obama did was not appoint the judges before he left office. He also did not appoint the Supreme Court judge before he left.  Trump was carrying on about Obama doing it before he left, so Obama did nothing. Then Trump gets in office, appoints all these judges, calls Obama a dumbass for not appointing them, then, as he is leaving office, appoints another SCOTUS judge and says he will not honor the same process the Democrats did when they left office.   I believe the called them stupid for not doing what he did.  Now, we are paying the price for not playing hardball with Trump in 2016. I hope the Dems in Congress are finally paying attention. The game has changed. The Republicans are not fighting for the way things were, they are fighting for how they want things to be - rich, white, men are the only ones who matter and they are going to shape the government as far in that direction as possible.   People who stayed at home during the last election are the reason we are in this mess. People who voted for Trump out of spite, suck.  Trump has also started a new ""Certification Process"" for every state where he wants Elon Musk and his team to certify all the voting processes and that no state's votes can be counted unless they are approved by his administration.  Trump is not planning on leaving office in 4 years. He wants to be Emperor and he wants his family to take over he goes.",Ayste,2025-04-07T07:20:02,1
"What's even more mind boggling, is republicans actually believing in this procedure. I have known Republicans who go on social media talking about ID requirements, and any other bullshit crap FOX news has crammed down their throats. It's all just fucking voter suppression which is what the GOP has to do these days. I am sure there was enough voter suppression to affect the past Presidential election as well.",justhavingfunyea,2025-04-06T19:28:30,65
"What I don't get (and don't live there so might be missing something).  Those votes were not for just the SC justice, I assume.  Are they tossing out the entire record and pulling those votes out of the other candidates totals or just tossing out the one they don't like?",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-06T19:21:00,17

"Do you live in a different reality? Just curious because saying ""The one, really dumb, thing Obama did was not appoint the judges before he left office. He also did not appoint the Supreme Court judge before he left."" Exposes that big time.   The reality is that Republicans blocked Obama every chance they could from 2008 on.     ""Just hours after news broke of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's passing, Donald Trump gave Senate Republicans three words of advice on filling the vacancy: ""delay, delay, delay.""  Senate Republicans didn't need his advice: that has been their strategy for years. Before Barack Obama set foot in the Oval Office, Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Republican colleagues decided to block him at every turn -- no matter what. They publicly promised to make government work, but away from the cameras they deployed stall-and-delay tactics to stop the government in its tracks.  Nowhere has that strategy been more insidious or persistent than in Republicans' efforts to block Obama's nominations to head agencies, fill judicial vacancies and staff other key government posts.""
