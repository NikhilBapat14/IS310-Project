Do you have a source for the numbers of legislation written? Are you including legislation proposed or just legislation that's passed? I know some members have proposed a ton of bills but only have their name on a small handful of successful bills.,craftworkbench,2022-09-26T02:35:26,14
"It's pretty unusual for a single, narrow piece of legislation to move successfully through the process by itself. Bills on similar topics almost always get combined into a single piece of legislation, typically by the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over the issue. Is that what you're talking about?  And it's not about credit. If some Congressperson's legislation gets included as a title of a broader bill, everybody still knows that it came from the original sponsor.",gaxxzz,2022-09-26T05:23:39,13
"Most legislation is written be lobbyists and committee staffers. Relatively few congresspeople even have their staff working on writing original and substantive legislation. The few who do are generally viewed as serious and respectable by their colleagues. This is why Lindsay Graham is taken seriously, for decades, he actually produces serious legislation meant to be passed into law. Ted Kennedy got respect across the aisle for the same thing.",LiberalAspergers,2022-09-26T06:33:13,11
"Oooh I can actually answer this!  A big part of it is resources. Party leadership positions get bigger staff budgets and more staff and as such, can spare the people to work on writing legislation more often. It's actually a pretty big endeavour to write a bill believe it or not, and not every congressperson has the time or the staff to create legislation all on their own, and certainly not at a constant rate.   Connected to that second point, if a member of Congress wants a bill passed, but it's scope is far beyond their own office's resources, they will bring it to party leadership. Leadership might just take the idea and lump it in with something else they're working on, maybe they'll write up a whole bill from scratch. Either way, it gets that leadership person's name on it.   So the short answer is that those leadership folks aren't coming up with all the ideas, but their offices have the resources to put together an actual bill from an idea.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-09-26T11:32:53,4
"This is a ""friend of a friend"" story...  A friend told me that when he was working for a legislator, he once saw party leadership deny introducing a bill that one person wrote, just would never let it come up.  Then when the guy eventually gave up on trying to get it in, the leadership scratched off the dude's name, put on his own name and introduced the bill.   I can't verify this, but sounds like something a politico would do",NoTable2313,2022-09-26T07:23:02,1
"Just as speculation, members of congress have a wide range of backgrounds. Some members have spent their lives studying the law, working in the political system, and likely have experience being part of the bill writing process in lesser roles before joining the Congress.  Then you have certain members who get elected because their brand of craziness tickles their base. These people arenâ€™t doing a lot of reading and writing on a day to day basis.",beetlemouth,2022-09-26T10:33:53,1
