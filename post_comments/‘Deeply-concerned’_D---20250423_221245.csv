"""I'm not going to talk over you, I'm just literally asking you a question...""  .... As she constantly talks over the interviewees' answers to those questions.  So fucking dumb",Just1DumbassBitch,2025-04-23T22:27:46,36

"Yassamin did great! And with a hostile Host, too.  **Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz**.  Here’s her interview on YouTube: [‘Deeply-concerned’ Dem rep defends El Salvador visit: ‘Constitutional crisis’ - Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERHv7LalhO4).    **Warning**: Laura Ingraham is a professional propagandist. Her aggressive behavior in this video can be unsettling to hear, especially if you’re inexperienced with Right-Wing media’s persuasion tactics, which “flood the zone” with lies, dehumanization, interruptions, changing the subject, [Ad-hominems](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/ad-hominem.html), and more.   Edit: added YouTube link.",biospheric,2025-04-23T22:16:18,24
Laura Ingraham is a garbage human who constantly lies and misleads.  How Fox News continues to exist is beyond me.,Level_Investigator_1,2025-04-23T23:31:23,22

"I don't know how you argue with the Supreme Court, she should memorize the line in the opinion given where the trump administration admits what they did was illegal and a clerical error. THEY ADMITTED FAULT there is nothing to discuss here",commanderfish,2025-04-23T23:57:25,9

Ingraham is a Trump boot licker !  I bet if one of her children adopted from Russia were deported in error she’d change her tune. !,New-Cupcake4479,2025-04-24T07:42:20,3

This obsession with every immigrant whose ever committed a crime sounds so much like Nazi propaganda. How will dems speak against this?,arichman11,2025-04-24T10:00:50,2
"What an insanely insufferable person. How would anyone watch this. They are so smug in everything that is said. It would not have mattered what the Congress-woman said, it would have been met with distain and circle speak.",HostileGoose404,2025-04-24T11:15:51,2
Laura ingraham is a cunt. People argue that she knows what’s she talking about because she has law degree… but people for get that ignorance can bypass all you accolades. She sound so racist and so unprofessional.,Doelike3000,2025-04-26T08:17:25,1
"If there is one things Laura Ingraham taught me it is that completely lazy morons can become rich and famous simply by pulling the long straw.  She lost me in December of 2008 when she made fun of President Elect Barak Obama for enjoying spicy mustard.  Apparently as a highly paid broadcaster she could not be bothered to read his book *The Audacity of  Hope,* and completely missed the part where he spoke of the incident at a diner with David Axelrod, when he asked for spicy mustard for his hot dog.  He specifically called out the banality of such things.  But apparently Laura is too good to  read the president elects book. (It only took an evening unlike Bill Clinton's , drop it and break your foot extra jumbo size memoir).  No, Laura is too busy to educate herself about the man she would be dissing for at least the next four years.  She is a lazy moron.",redditisnosey,2025-04-24T06:00:01,10
"I'm not doing for my health. I feel it's important to expose propaganda tactics. Plus I wanted to acknowledge Ansari's courage and aptitude by not only going on Fox News, but going right into the lion's den of their prime time programming.",biospheric,2025-04-24T14:00:35,1
