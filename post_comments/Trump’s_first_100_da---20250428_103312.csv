"His crusade against immigration, the need for revenge, his authoritarian drift, the erosion of ties with allies and a trade war have marked the start of the Republicanâ€™s second term in office.",nimicdoareu,2025-04-28T10:33:26,6

I am just amazed that people were happy with his first term and or didn't remember he is a pussy grabbing insurrectionists and convicted Felon with a history of failed businesses and grift. Just look at what this man and his family have done over the last 50 years.  That he was elected again is an indictment of how stupid about 40% of the American public are. It is disgusting.,IRUL-UBLOW-7128,2025-04-28T11:01:50,3

"His first 100 days set the tone for his presidency. A lot of controversial decisions and policies came out early, but it was just the beginning of what would become a rollercoaster of chaos ðŸ¤¯",Silent_Riddle,2025-04-28T10:50:09,2
That incompetence may be what saves us from this colossal cluserfuck.,oculeers,2025-04-28T10:43:19,2
