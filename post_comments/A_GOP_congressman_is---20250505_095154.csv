">Voters in U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler’s suburban New York swing district heaped criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around [President Donald Trump’s](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement.  >The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began.  >The first crack emerged when Lawler, in his opening remarks, told the packed prep school auditorium: “This is what democracy looks like.”  >Laughter crept through the crowd.  >On Sunday, Lawler’s staff required people to RSVP and set up a series of ground rules, including that attendees live in the district, not record at the event, refrain from shouting or standing, and “be respectful of one another, of staff, and of the Congressman,” a sign at the door read.  >At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs and security, law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium. The crowd chanted “let her stay, let her stay” before law enforcement picked her up and carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal.  >“Shame! Shame! Shame!,” the audience yelled.  >Lawler tried to get back on track: “Folks, tariffs are way more complicated than you want to make them.”  >The crowd groaned.  >“Folks, enough!,” Lawler said above the din.  >Soon after, another person was removed. Then another.  >In the audience, Jeanette Spoor, a 74-year-old retiree, said she wanted to ask Lawler about the future of Social Security and Medicaid but wasn’t called on during the nearly two hour event.  >“You’re not helping your constituents if you’re making it hard for them to get help,” she said in an interview.  >She added, “I have no hopes for this guy.”  >Another attendee, Kristi Thompson, 52, said she was bothered by what she said were Lawler’s long-winded answers that didn’t address the substance of the crowd’s questions.  >“He claims to be available to constituents but he isn’t,” she said.  >The crowd walked out during the final question of the night, which was about protests against Israel. Lawler began to answer, but cut himself off as the room emptied out.",YesterShill,2025-05-05T09:53:51,36
"He sponsored an interesting bill that makes it illegal for individuals to boycott Israel.  Million bucks, 20 years in prison.  I had no idea this was a thing until yesterday.  BDS laws.  Wikipedia.  I find it unwholesome to agree with MTG on this.  I find it genuinely confusing.  Maybe somebody with better understanding can explain how or why this bill is a thing.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-05T10:19:01,25
Fucking Nazi party. Any media outlet that does not make the comparison is failing us.,williamgman,2025-05-05T10:44:56,15
These Republican assholes frauds have balls of steel for the kind of nonsense sound-bite propaganda garbage they pedal at these events. Even stupid people should be offended.,Stinkstinkerton,2025-05-05T12:10:13,6
What I'm curious about is how many who attend these town halls voted for these congressperons  vs a democratic candidate,coatofforearm,2025-05-05T10:23:22,4
"These paid protesters sure are zealous, traveling across the country to fake opposition at town halls.  Maybe they recruited on Signal.  I'd sure like to see the process GOP claims.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-05T09:59:33,15

"If you’re uncomfortable agreeing with MTG, you should rethink your position on this bill. Why should anyone be charged for boycotting? That’s fascism. That’s why MTG supports it. Wherever you stand on the Israeli/ Palestine discussion, this bill is bad government.",WaterNerd518,2025-05-05T12:26:37,10
"I’m curious, why does that matter at all? He was elected, they are all equally constituents now.",WaterNerd518,2025-05-05T12:24:33,6
"By the look of that photo, they sure did put in a lot of effort to look like seasoned MAGA supporters. They obviously take their acting gigs seriously.",biscuitarse,2025-05-05T10:45:45,4
They are sleeper agents that lived in the district for decades just for this moment. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-05T10:17:07,10
How can you tell the difference between boycotting and just being poor?,UnusedTimeout,2025-05-05T17:10:22,2
"Yes, but it sure would be fascinating to pick the brain of someone who voted for a republican and then came to a town hall to complain about all the Republican things they are doing.",Hitthe777,2025-05-05T14:16:25,3
