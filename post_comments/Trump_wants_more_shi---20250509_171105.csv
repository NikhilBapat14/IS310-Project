Weird article not to mention the Jones Act at all.,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-09T17:16:03,4
So why aren’t we building them ourselves? Why isn’t the administration bringing back manufacturing to the US? If they actually believed in their bs they spew this would be a the most logical method of production.,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-09T17:44:13,3

It reads like an advertisement rather than news. Garbage article IMO. They try and invoke American domestic ship building in WWII and then claim “let’s build everything in Korea!”. I expect nothing less from the hill.,P1xelHunter78,2025-05-09T17:27:01,3
"It did also talk about Korean shipbuilding companies buying American dockyards, though ""build everything in Korea"" is probably what's most likely to happen. It's hard to find large numbers of young American workers with manufacturing experience, who are not on drugs, and are willing to work for wages that would be competitive with those of workers in countries where the cost of living is much lower. I remember they tried to open a mine (or maybe it was a weapons plant) in some town in the Midwest and they could not find enough people in a 50 mile radius who could pass a drug test",Irr3sponsibl3,2025-05-09T17:44:49,1
"Crunch time looms for MAGA as it falls to pieces around them.   The Hill is desperately flogging the MAGA dead horse of a fanciful , rosy economic future for US manufacturing and export.  US ports are becoming clogged with fleets of empty cargo ships. Many appear destined to remain tied up for a long time.  The Hill is a steaming mound of composting propaganda.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-09T22:37:01,1
"In my experience it’s not finding enough people who can pass a drug test, but it’s *paying* enough to get workers who care enough. When you offer low wages, you get low performing workers. This includes habitual drug users or those with dependencies. Ship building is hard and dangerous skilled work. To get people who want to take the job seriously it takes more than just a living wage. This is one of the reasons why heavy industry has been offshored. Companies take the cash they’d normally have to pay to get a skilled work force and pocket it. Blaming the work force isn’t totally accurate, blame the employers. It’s a free market, and if labor is in high demand then you have to meet that demand.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-09T18:03:31,1
"You raise a good point that lower wages should come with lower expectations on worker qualifications and motivations. But it's also a fact that there are regions in America where the young adult population has been decimated by drugs, largely in part due to the fact that they face serious economic downturn and instability and social collapse. I assign as much agency to the workers for their drug problems as I do on individual Americans for their weight problems when there's an obesity epidemic.   Employers should offer higher wages to attract better talent. But if they're competing to sell products on a market, there's a limit to how much they can improve worker pay without making their products more expensive and uncompetitive (not that they're really trying that hard in neoliberal America - they would rather keep the money for CEO salaries and shareholder value). They're not doing enough, for sure, but they still would be competing with lower wages across the world. A global free market creates downward pressures on worker's wages that would have to be countered by tariffs, price floors or bans.  Global free trade naturally tends to move manufacturing to where labor was cheaper and this wasn't considered a problem by mainstream economists, who assumed that industrial countries would transition to higher-end and service-based economies. It was only the recent anti-neoliberal push that started emphasizing national security and working class concerns. We're in this awkward transition from a global free trade system to a protectionist one when our country has not been investing sufficiently into infrastructure and education, a task that would be difficult for a capable administration, let alone the incompetent one we have now.",Irr3sponsibl3,2025-05-09T19:52:55,1
