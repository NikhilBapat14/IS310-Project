Trump's solution is to reward Russia for invading. But the short answer is only two make the choice to end it. Russia can leave Ukraine and it's over. Or Ukraine can surrender.,ianrl337,2025-04-23T08:12:27,1
"I don‚Äôt know man. People in North Korea have to eat tree bark because there‚Äôs no food and that country is also somehow still around. It could be over tomorrow or it could drag on for another century. All I‚Äôm certain about is that Russia is gonna fall apart eventually.  The US and China will most likely continue to exist but I‚Äôm not sure how much time their governments have left.

"I don't like my country of birth needing to deal with this (yes, I am Ukrainian, although I speak Russian). I wish this war, and the one that began in 2014, didn't begin at all. I want to see Russian war criminals (and to a lesser extent, Ukrainian ones), punished.

I don‚Äôt support trump. I hate him. And i love Obama. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Obama could have done more about Russia. Election interference and crimea were handled far too gently.,CEOrifice,2025-04-23T07:27:29,1
"Nah, both Obama and Biden responded poorly to Russia‚Äôs aggression they could have and should have done more. Biden in particular had an opportunity early on to inflict fatal wounds on Russia.

It could all end tomorrow if Putin would just fuck off. Insisting that Zelenskyy must swallow poison and grant Putin everything he wants isn't a peace deal. There's no reason for Putin not to just keep going apportioning himself whatever choice cuts of other countries he wants if this is how we react.,SoldierOf4Chan,2025-04-22T19:48:15,9

"Hindsight is 20/20. Russia was becoming more integrated with the global community with somewhat incremental steps towards a more democratic government and open society. Russia's economy was more intertwined with the EU. Economics is the future battleground so torpedoing your economy to achieve your military ambitions is unwise, which is pretty much the only reason China has not invaded Taiwan yet. No one could have predicted that Putin would throw the Russian economy into the shitter for a delusional return to the Soviet era.",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-04-23T11:06:41,1

Same here. He should have given ukraine what they asked for and greenlit a more counter attacks,CEOrifice,2025-04-23T07:29:35,1

You have reason to be concerned. Trump is a threat to Democracy around the world.¬†,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T19:07:12,1
"Realistically, we cannot give up. There is no scenario in which giving Putin Crimea ends this conflict. If it did, the conflict wouldn't have begun in the first place. This is Chamberlain handing Hitler Poland and imagining he'll never take any more land. It's a fantasy. Putin wants it all and will not stop because you called it a peace deal.  Denying reality will not make anyone safer.",SoldierOf4Chan,2025-04-22T20:35:52,5
"Realistically, if the sanctions are maintained much longer, Putin might not have a choice. The Ukrainian economy is a hell of a lot stronger than the Russian.  There's more than one way to skin a cat.",egamruf,2025-04-23T10:25:39,2
Biden was also hamstrung by a non-cooperative House. The Republican majority put the brakes on his proposed help efforts midway through his term.,TWVer,2025-04-23T06:17:27,3
I don't believe that. I think Biden just genuinely did not want to escalate the conflict. Putin is unpredictable. He is not like Xi Jinping who has more measured responses. Putin is determined to achieve his goals everything else be damned. Biden was also held back by a GOP-controlled House so funding always had strings attached to it.,dr_z0idberg_md,2025-04-23T11:01:59,1

"That might be true, but it's not the quality of the nukes people are concerned about. It's the quantity. Under arms agreements, the U.S. and Russia maintain a certain number of nuclear weapons as active and a defined number in inactive service. The U.S. has smarter nukes and delivery systems, but Russia has slightly more to counteract that. It only takes a few nukes to find their targets among the eight thousand or so nukes Russia has...",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-04-23T16:20:54,1

"They know. It‚Äôs not hard to work out, but believe what you wish. Maybe Russia has had a whole second military budget, as big as the public one, financing the titanic expense of upkeep and renewal both of warheads and missiles.
