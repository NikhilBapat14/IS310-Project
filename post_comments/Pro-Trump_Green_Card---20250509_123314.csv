"Omg, this is hilarious. First of all, why would any immigrant support trump??? Secondly, why would a **Ukrainian** immigrant support trump?!!  What a hypocrite:  >She said he was specifically supportive of the president's immigration policies, saying ""he's against people coming in illegally.""  >Kostenyuk was convicted in 2018 of two felony theft charges involving a stolen television and tools that he later pawned. He pleaded guilty, was ordered to pay restitution, served six days in jail and received three years of probation, according to KUOW.  So he wants illegal immigrants to be punished, yet he himself committed crimes. And of course, he supports a criminal president. Lol.  Thankfully his girlfriend is able to see the light:  >Loisate, who faults Trump and his immigration policies for Kostenyuk's two-month detention, says her partner was a Trump supporter, telling KUOW: ""You should see his garage, there's nothing but Trump flags everywhere and posters everywhere.

So even though he's already paid for the crime, that didn't seem to matter. He was still kidnapped.   It really goes to show just how racist this whole thing is. It implies that only immigrants get severely punished for committing crimes, or makes it seem like only immigrants are capable of crime.

"The explanation IMHO is that these are, fundamentally, reactionary movements. They see, or rather feel, society as a social and moral hierarchy based on identity, i.e. some people are better than others because of who they are and deserve privileges over others.  However, this means that the group of adherents to these ideas and and the membership of movements that express them politically self-select on selfishness, exceptionalism and the ability to shut down empathy for those perceived as different or other. So you get people who all think they are part of the core group, participate with glee in ostracizing, discriminating and otherwise harming others, and are then totally surprised when it happens to them too. And because empathy is conditional, solidarity never materializes, so there is never any internal push back when ""one of their own"" gets targeted. The moment you are targeted, you are no longer one of them. It is the obvious consequence of tying morality and status to identity, or rather the perception thereof.  On a greater scale, this is why the societies constructed by reactionary movements never have just one underclass. They construct an endless set of concentric in-groups, each disdaining the ones below them and hating the ones directly above them. The only thing that unites them is a hatred of equality.  In this instance, they dislike *other* immigrants or want to look down on them in order to feel better about themselves or to feel more secure in their own position in society. What matters to them is not whether they themselves are immigrants too, but whether they identify with those others. If they don't, and they entertain these emotions regarding others, they fall into the same dynamic as people who see themselves as ""native"" citizens. Most of these ""anti-illegal-immigration"" or ""anti-immigration"" movements around the globe are not really that. Their members don't really care about the legal niceties. Neither does anyone who immigrated into a country and shares their ideas in a way that conveniently excludes them.",barryvm,2025-05-09T13:26:56,10

"> Immigrants who followed the rules don’t like illegal immigrants either.   What distinguishes Trump from non-Trump supporters is prejudice. They think illegal immigrants are criminals. Listen to the language used by Trump and Vance and now Rubio. It's all about vilifications. People who buy this reveal their prejudices. And this is what separates Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters. Yes, legal immigrants can hold these prejudices too. Hack there are illegal immigrants who support Trump because of their prejudices too. [source](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-latino-trump-election-resentment-asylum).   Yes not much different from MAGA farmers who are also broadly prejudiced like they think democrats give free cellphones to the undeserving in urban areas while they have it tough in rural areas.  Antiabortion is rooted in prejudices against pregnant women who want abortions. The terms (immoral, murderers) they use reveal that. The policies (supporting fake abortion centers lying to pregnant women, no exception for abortions, etc) they use real that.     >The connection between prejudice and authoritarianism lay at the heart of our analysis of Trump’s supporters, and the survey strongly supported it. How strongly? The correlation between RWA Scale scores and prejudice equalled .856, which is as close to perfection (1.00) as you are likely to ever see in social science. To put it another way, suppose you decided to hold a dance for the 100 most prejudiced white people in your community, along with the 100 most authoritarian ones. (Who knows why you would want to? We do not.) Would you need to print 200 invitations? No, about 120 should do it, since most of the people who are one will also be the other. There is about an 80 percent overlap. > >... > >“most amazing discovery you never heard of,” that you can explain most prejudice in terms of authoritarianism. So social scientists have not been crying wolf for all these years. There truly is a big, very bad wolf at our collective doors, and this metaphoric evil snarls such intolerance, discrimination, and victimization that it not only injures its immediate victims, but also shakes our democratic society to its core. Knowingly or unknowingly, prejudiced people bring into the voting booth something of even greater danger to everyone’s freedom and our country’s very existence: authoritarianism. As we explained in our earlier chapters, the most prejudiced people in America were likely drawn to Trump because he told them their prejudices were justified. But they connected with him and with one another on more than their attitudes toward minorities, for the showman at the rallies was a megalomaniac and demagogue driven to dominate everyone in the world. He did not campaign on a platform of overthrowing democracy, obviously, but he did sanctify prejudice. And the crowd that responded to his evil message was full of authoritarian supporters yearning for a mighty leader to fight their enemies and protect them.  From Authoritarian Nightmare, by John W.

That i never figured out. USCIS never sent out a memo asking that to be done or outright cancelling it. They rolled out the new cards (very nice looking btw) and for a while they were running both. I traveled a couple times that year no issue.  My lawyer agreed with the CPB though. Maybe some internal stuff we peons didn't know. Lots of those.,debugprint,2025-05-09T18:23:36,2
