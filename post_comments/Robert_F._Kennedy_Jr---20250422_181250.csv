How is this not a wheelbarrow full of HIPAA violations?,4ivE,2025-04-22T18:19:09,7079
"To all the skeptics:  - This debunked claim originated from a small study back in 1998 authored by the infamous Andrew Wakefield. The study was later found to be inherently flawed and fraudulent, and was not only retracted, but repudiated by the scientific community.  - The author of the study had his medical license revoked for serious professional misconduct and he has since been ostracized by medical experts.  - Since then, many large scale, rigorous studies have established no link between vaccines and autism.   - Wakefield's study included only 12 children, and while it shouldn't have to be stated, this kind of sample size is unprecedentedly small—meaningless in fact—and far too small to draw any reliable conclusions from.  - Wakefield was also criticized for a lack of a control group in his study, which is an essential part of any meaningful experimental study.  - He also altered patients medical histories to support his claims, he had conflicts of interest and his study involved the unethical treatment of children.  - Dozens of large scale studies involving literally millions of children have since been conducted, all of them consistently pointing to the same conclusions—that vaccines do not cause autism.  - Thimerosal—a mercury based preservative previously  used more commonly in some vaccines—was also the target of anti-vax claims which have since been debunked.  - Extensive research has shown that there is no link between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, while research has also shown that even low doses of the preservative in vaccines do not cause any harm other than minor reactions like redness/swelling at the site of injection.  - And despite this research, Thimerosal was still removed from most childhood vaccines anyways as a precautionary measure. It is only really used in some flu vaccines today, and even then, you can request vaccines without it.  I feel compelled to add to this a short list of some of the dangerous and unfounded claims Kennedy has made over the years.   But first, I've heard a few people (outside of his fringe followers) argue that some of the criticisms levied against RFK Jr. are unwarranted or unfair because of his record as an environmental lawyer. In other cases, some people try to downplay his insanity, arguing that his words are taken out of context.  When it comes to the former, RFK Jr. has since lost all credibility due to the erratic, harmful and baseless claims he's made related to vaccines and public health  Not to mention his adherence to Trump and a MAGA agenda that is eroding the independence of public health related agencies, that's stripping knowledgeable civil servants of their protections, that's maligning medical professionals and propping up discredited ""health experts"" (quacks), all while his department is taking steps to dismantle agencies and organizations that are largely responsible for the day-to-day operations and broader objectives related to protecting the environment and maintaining public health and safety.  Id also be remiss if I didn't mention his founding of The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vax non profit that played a significant role in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of dozens of children.  I should also mention his recent trip to the Southwest, which is currently at the center of a historic measles outbreak, where he praised a ""healer"" who was administering alternative treatments to unvaccinated children and adults while infected with the measles no less.  Now when it comes to the argument that Kennedy really isn't as batshit as the media makes him out to be, here are just some recent examples of his ignorant and dangerous remarks:  > Kennedy said, 'I probably did say, Lyme disease is ""highly likely a militarily engineered bioweapon""'  > Kennedy has repeatedly suggested environmental toxins, including those in drinking water, are linked to gender identity in children. These claims are unfounded.  > He has reiterated a thoroughly debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism  > Kennedy has also referred to the Covid vaccine as “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” despite data showing it’s overwhelmingly safe.  > At an event last year, Kennedy promoted a racist and antisemitic theory that Covid “ethnically targeted” white and Black people but not Ashkenazi Jews or Chinese people.  > Kennedy has amplified baseless claims suggesting a link between antidepressants like Prozac and school shootings. “Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events,” he told billionaire Elon Musk last year. But research shows that most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications — and even when they were, there was no association between those drugs and the shootings.  > He has long peddled AIDS denialism conspiracy theories, alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and questioning the “theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS.”  > He lamented that “any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable — even dangerous — heresy among our reigning medical cartel and its media allies”   > Kennedy’s book frequently cites discredited work of Peter Duesberg, a prominent AIDS denialist. “I haven’t found any evidence that HIV ever actually kills a T-cell.”  > He argued vaccines make people “lose IQ” and said the vaccine “dominant narrative” has “little proof.”  > Kennedy claimed vaccinologists add toxins to vaccines to amplify immune response. “They literally went on a search throughout the world looking for the most toxic things that they could find in order to add them to the vaccine,”  > Kennedy claimed that nobody knows the risk for any currently scheduled vaccines and that “nobody can say with any scientific certainty that [the polio] vaccine is averting more injuries than death than it’s causing.”  > [He] claimed flu and polio vaccines increase susceptibility to future flu strains and polio cases.  > Kennedy has also claimed that ""there is zero evidence that the flu shot prevents any hospitalization or any deaths... The flu shot transmits the flu. In fact, if you get the flu shot, you're six times more likely to give somebody else the flu, than if you didn't get the flu shot.""  > ""Since we started mandating the flu shot for elderly people... Their life expectancy has dramatically gone down.""  > ...Speaking on “Health Freedom for Humanity,” a podcast run by a nonprofit advocating for medical freedom, Kennedy encouraged people to join him in telling strangers not to vaccinate their babies  > In July 2023, the same month he testified at the House hearing, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.”  > He also accused Fauci of destroying repurposed medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that also “would’ve obliterated Covid.”  Kennedy is an obvious kook who should have been disqualified from any position in government, let alone a position that oversees all public health related agencies.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-22T18:49:59,330

"As per [original article](https://people.com/rfk-jr-to-launch-autism-registry-using-private-health-records-11720156) 📰:  - The HHS secretary is also launching a registry that will track Americans with autism.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, is set to amass the private medical records of Americans for a new autism study.   On April 21, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya — director of the National Institutes of Health — announced that the NIH will provide Kennedy with data pulled from a number of federal and commercial databases, CBS News reports.  Kennedy — who has previously promoted a scientifically debunked claim that autism is caused by vaccines — is also launching a new registry to track Americans with autism.  Bhattacharya explained that between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will have access to these records, and they will be provided with grant funding to carry out Kennedy’s autism studies. He added that this data will allow researchers to study “comprehensive” patient data with “broad coverage” of the U.S. population for the first time.  Bhattacharya said during a presentation that the data will include medical records from pharmacy chains, lab tests, genomics data from patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service, claims from private insurers, data from smartwatches and fitness trackers and more.  The NIH director noted that combining the data could lead to “real-time health monitoring” on Americans.  “What we’re proposing is a transformative real-world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,” he said, per the outlet.  This news comes on the heels of statements Kennedy made at a press conference on April 16, when he claimed that “autism destroys families.”  “These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted,” he added.  The comments sparked outrage among autism advocates, with many arguing that Kennedy’s words promoted outdated and harmful rhetoric about people with the neurodevelopmental condition.   Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, told CNN that Kennedy’s comments “made it sound like these were people whose lives were worthless, when that couldn’t be further from the case.”  A CDC study published on April 15 reported that one in 31 children in America will be diagnosed with autism by the age of 8 — an increase from the past two decades. However, experts widely agree that the increase in autism rates over time is not actually because more people are developing the disorder — instead, doctors are merely getting better at correctly identifying autism as diagnostic tools become more sophisticated, per NBC News.  “Parents shouldn’t panic,” Dr. Alex Kolevzon, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, told the outlet. “We’re not seeing an epidemic with autism.”",T_Shurt,2025-04-22T18:14:40,81

"RFK Jr.’s proposed national autism registry—built on harvesting private health records without clear consent—is a dystopian privacy nightmare disguised as public health policy. This isn’t about helping people with autism. It’s about normalizing mass surveillance of Americans’ most sensitive medical and biometric data.  Let’s be clear: anonymized data is a myth when you combine health records, genomics, pharmacy logs, and smartwatch data. These datasets can—and have—been de-anonymized, revealing identities through simple cross-referencing. Once your data is in a government-run registry, it’s one breach or policy shift away from being used against you or your family.  Here’s what you can do to fight back and protect your privacy: 	1.	Refuse blanket data-sharing permissions. Opt out of health information exchanges (HIEs) where possible. Many healthcare portals let you adjust permissions. 	2.	Secure your wearables and apps. Revoke unnecessary permissions and stop uploading health metrics to cloud services. These are goldmines for profiling. 	3.	Use HIPAA to your advantage. Demand copies of your medical records and see who they’ve been shared with. You have the right to restrict disclosures. 	4.	Support privacy-first legislation. This move by RFK Jr. underscores why we need stronger federal data protection laws, not weaker ones. 	5.	Talk to your doctors. Many aren’t even aware where their data goes. Push back on automatic opt-ins and demand transparency in data handling. 	6.	Don’t be fooled by “it’s for research.” Ethical research doesn’t begin with coercion, secrecy, or mass surveillance. This is a power grab.  This registry sets a terrifying precedent: if a politician can justify exploiting your most private data for a cause—even one as emotionally charged as autism—they’ll do it again for anything. Today it’s autism. Tomorrow it’s mental health, reproductive history, or genetic risk profiles.  If you care about your family’s right to privacy, don’t sit this one out.",MegSpen725,2025-04-23T05:59:10,10

"Read Extreme Privacy by Michael Bazzell. It’s essentially a guide for how to legally make yourself as difficult to find electronically as possible.   In this book he discusses the functionality of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) which are organizations that share health information for patients in a given city, state, or region amongst medical providers. It is possible in most cases to opt out of having your information shared. In addition, prescription data exchanges like SureScripts perform a similar function with medication, and they also have the option to opt out of sharing.   So try and put together as complete a list as you can of all the doctors/clinics/hospitals/etc you have ever visited and research the HIEs they are part of so you can start getting opt out forms sent out. Additionally, look into your providers’ EHR software (e.g. MyChart) and disable sharing. Then call providers and hospitals directly to request they not share your information as you are a victim of identity theft (what this administration is doing with private data meets the criteria IMO).   This won’t do anything to retroactively hide data that has already been shared, and of course there are other means the government can use to find this information, but as with physical security, anything you can do to make yourself a more challenging target helps. And having less entities in possession of your data means less of your personal information is revealed in the event of government/third party subpoenas of hospitals, clinics, etc. requesting data pertaining to medical records.   Avoid using smart watches or other digital products that track personal health metrics.   In some circumstances, individual providers may be willing to “drop” certain diagnoses if you have not experienced symptoms for a certain duration of time, or use more opaque and less obvious diagnostic codes for billing. This can be useful for people with “controversial” medical histories such as mental illnesses, substance abuse, abortion, etc.   Depending on one’s financial and legal status, it may also be possible to pay out of pocket for care and bypass the health insurance data warehouse. In some cases people even use LLCs to further obfuscate their identity and then use the LLC EIN instead of SSN so providers do not have their most sensitive personal information.",someguynamedcole,2025-04-22T22:58:18,1

Initially, propaganda campaigns were launched to dehumanize disabled individuals, portraying them as burdens on society. Then came the identification phase, where doctors and officials were tasked with selecting individuals deemed “incurably sick.” These victims were sent to specialized facilities under the guise of receiving treatment.  The next phase involved systematic killings, often through gas chambers or lethal injections. The program was shrouded in secrecy, with families receiving falsified death certificates. Despite official suspension in 1941 due to public outcry, covert killings continued until the end of World War II.  ———————————-  When are Americans going to wake up, and stand up!

Nor will they be studying the use of television and digital media on early child development. Or how either of those types of things might possibly link to autism spectrum disorder.  What they will be doing is looking for a retooled testing apparatus for ASD, so they can deny benefits. Like a high water mark.

It'll be blinded to the point that you can't identify an individual, but you do get essentially rows as patients data for w/e slice of their health journey you are buying. 2. then there is a whole set of regulations around 'reidentification risk' [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6450246/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6450246/) .  Especially when health data is combined with other types of data (like consumer habits, think marketing targeting stuff) you need to take precautions to ensure you are managing this risk.  again, not saying this is good, and I can say that this type of data is way way more limited in the EU (my EU colleagues regularly bemoan how much higher resolution US data is), but you can absolutely do this sort of research without violating HIPAA.  I will also add I see nothing in the article posted that explains how they are managing this, these are just some thought starters on how this is managed by companies following the law.

There are provisions in place for gathering data about cohorts of patients for analysis as well as for matching patients with care. That's how they rolled out programs for type II diabetes for Medicare Advantage patients over the last several years, for example. So, if you have a ICD-10 F84 code on a claim or clinical note you might be in the cohort if it was at a time when you were enrolled in a Federal healthcare system program overseen by CMS.   Remember when DOGE goons found fraud that had already been identified and tried to take credit for it? The rules for how to share the data were finalized under Biden I believe.

"Exactly. It’s not an autism epidemic. It’s just that people who would have previously been recognized as smart but eccentric and others who are more capable of masking are now being recognized as neurodivergent, usually ADHD, autism, or the combo of AuDHD. AuDHD seems to be really common in people who are high functioning, probably because the combo almost makes them seem neurotypical but it’s more that they are going back and forth between the two extremes.   The other thing that people are ignoring is the strong hereditary component. The whole way my father’s maternal side gets referenced is crazy smart, punctuate as necessary. That whole side of the family trends towards neurospiciness. My father is probably neurodivergent but high-masking and currently a top-tier lawyer, I know I have ADHD, and both my kids have AuDHD.

"Dude, the majority of people with autism who care about that are just sick of watching people *instantly* start treating them as less intelligent the moment they find out about the autism. Back when Aspergers was a diagnosis, it wasn't as bad because we were viewed as just a bit quirky (which was irritating itself, admittedly), but when the switch happened we instead started having to prove we weren't near mutes who would start flailing around if we heard TV static. Hell, I've had to make that distinction to medical professionals I've dealt with. I understand this might be viewed as an ego ""I'm better than those with the severe stuff"" thing, but for me it's more about the inaccuracy than anything. There is such a functional difference between the ends of the scales that they're nearly different disorders to begin with.  Honestly, I personally think we should have dumped the name Asperger for the reasons you've stated, but I also think going for the *full* umbrella route was a mistake.

But there is no legal way I am aware of to link this data back to an individual.  And this masking is done at a very low level when the data is collected.    I don't see how it be logistically possible, let alone legal, to compile an autism registry with identified individuals.    But you could probably wrangle some sort of finding like 'we think there are actually 5x as many people autism as previously thought' if you wanted to torture the data, it would probably tell you this.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-22T19:59:49,-4

"In medicine, registries are often deidentified data only. QCDR is the term you can Google, and patient consented versions are worth a lot lot more.   So it’s very likely this registry is deID.

"Well, if they have the raw data, then there are no protections.  To summarize, you have 2 (basic) vectors of data disclosure:  - data breaches, which is in the purview of cybersecurity  - disclosure through legitimate statistical releases, which is where I work   In my field, people generally want to release descriptions of the data for statistical/research purposes. I make sure that researchers do this in an ethical and private way... i.e. make sure no observation/person/firm inadvertently has their data or attributes released. Differential privacy mathematically bounds the amount of knowledge that can be learned about any observation from a statistical release. This is incredibly important in the modern computing environment.  Government statistical agencies are actually at the forefront of this literature, and they work hard to ensure that the data they have in custodianship isn't inadvertently shared. They don't share the microdata with enforcement agencies, either. Which is why these DOGE breaches are huge. It's the equivalent of blindly handing over your data to an untrustworthy crackhead. Data wholesale leaving an agency just doesn't normally happen -- albeit there are some regrettable mistakes in the past, like shared Census data on Japanese residents during WWII.

If the government gets permission from say Apple to access all of its citizens private data—health and location info, habits, apps, consumer patterns, maybe eventually communication data, political affiliation, etc—starting with the premise that its health research, that’s an enormous step towards accessing forms of data that can be used to track and manage citizens, temporary or permanent residents or undocumented. It’s also a treasure trove of sellable info.  If the government can successfully bypass HIPAA protections in the name of health, that opens the door to things like pregnancy registries and monitoring, or LGBT registries and monitoring, racial registries, etc. They’re testing the waters now and piloting systems of oppression that will likely be tested in the Supreme Court, and the neurodiverse are a vulnerable enough community to be an easy early target to build from.

BUT, after the Dobbs decision, the Final Rule was implemented by HHS to modify HIPPA to expressly prohibit healthcare providers from sharing info with law enforcement when the abortion was obtained legally in another state. Yes, there are some states that have challenged the Final Rule but I don’t think it’s been struck down as of yet.  HIPPA isn’t dead nor is the Final Rule nor can Dobbs or Roe decisions undo them.",Veei,2025-04-23T00:38:51,13

"Few things  - Scandinavian countries always had these supports, so there is something else happening in Europe if Birth rates are falling  “…Birth rates in northern countries also show signs of decline as the causes become more structural and unrelated to wealth and stability…“   “…In order for families to decide to have children, “the important thing is the living and upbringing conditions, the rest are short-term measures or patches”, says Marta Seiz, doctor in Political and Social Sciences, specialised in demography. She believes that one-off aids such as ‘baby payments’ to promote the birth rate do not foster birth rates in the long term. “Access to early childhood education from 0 to 3 years of age is very important, as it makes it easier to reconcile work and family life,” Seiz adds….”  “…. Although a relationship has been observed between level of ecucation and fertility (the higher the level of education, the more children), the researchers conclude that job stability is much more decisive. “For those who are unemployed, fertility rates plummet, both for women that have a university degree and those who don’t. And for those who have a permanent job, during the economic crisis not only did fertility not fall, but it stayed on the same level and even slightly increased”…..”   “…The Covid crisis has also added a new layer of uncertainty for families and those who study population trends. In Spain, nine months after the confinement, births plummeted, according to figures from the National Institute of Statistics.  It is still too early to tell how long the effect of the pandemic will last and the challenge of guessing what the birth trends will be is becoming increasingly complex. Some authors paint a scenario in which Generation Z will bring about a system that makes societies more family and child friendly. For Sobotka, whatever happens, research on fertility and its changes will continue to be “relevant and surprising” in the coming decades….”  https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/nordic-countries-shatter-birth-rates-why-stability-is-no-longer-enough/",Ultravagabird,2025-04-23T19:07:02,1

"I am also not a lawyer. I should clarify that I don’t mean to say that there aren’t other protections like HIPPA. I simply meant to explain the privacy argument as it relates to the overturning of roe and Casey via Dobbs. I don’t disagree with your perspective on this.   From an argument perspective, the erosion of privacy in other parts of our lives via Dobbs claim is a slippery slope fallacy. Although it may not be logically sound we are also in a time when our democracy is no longer operating under the “framers intent” and literal interpretations are being favored over perhaps more logical readings of the constitution. So it seems this slippery slope is an exception to the rule, especially when combined with evidence of our privacy in the context of the patriot act and corporate personhood.   HIPPA ought to be a fail safe for things like the RFK plan in question, but will it operate as such? I don’t know, but as a person who has seen her access to healthcare dramatically decrease in Texas during the 2010s and later with the Dobbs decision, I can’t say I’m optimistic that anyone is protected from a government dead set on denying people of rights.",goolalalash,2025-04-23T09:43:17,1

"As someone recently professionally diagnosed with the hybrid subtype of ADHD I do understand it has 3 different subtypes. My understanding is that ADHD always had 2 sub types they just now considered ADD as an additional subtype. Again I’m not an expert but the other reasoning I’ve heard is that further research has shown that ADHD and ADD are more similar than different regarding the actual “how” the brain works. The resulting personality traits do differ and thus the subtypes.   Medically combining similar neurotypes like ADHD and Autism is useful for research and honestly in America it’s super useful for insurance purposes.   I understand the frustration of being misunderstood and having people assume different things about you based around an ignorance of your diagnosis. The solution to that isn’t more categories that muddy up people’s understanding though. The solution is more education, empathy, and awareness.   Medicine changes overtime as our understanding of the human body changes. It’s natural that names will change and things will be combined when we realize it’s more similar than different. Especially around the brain and how it works.   30 years since your diagnosis has seen an explosion of research on the brain and how it works. Medication is way more understood. It was only 30 years prior to your diagnosis we finally stopped institutionalizing people for symptoms related to ADHD and Autism.",MimeTravler,2025-04-23T08:17:07,-1

Its very roots are buried in fascism and eugenics and while it certainly is true that not all ASD is the same, Asperger’s was diagnosed to point out your usefulness to society not to understand yourself better. A broken clock is right twice a day, that doesn’t make it useful to keep around.

"The argument that took down Roe vs Wade is that the right to abortion wasn't enshrined in the constitution—specifically, it wasn't found to be deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition—thus the precedent establishing that right could be invalidated, and the general right to privacy, as interpreted by Roe to include abortion, was deemed insufficient grounds to protect it.   Drawing a parallel logic, one might argue that the specific authority for Congress to comprehensively regulate health information privacy nationwide isn't explicitly enumerated or historically understood within its Commerce Clause power. If a court accepted this narrower view of Congressional authority, similar to how Dobbs found no specific constitutional grounding for abortion rights, it could potentially invalidate HIPAA by ruling Congress overstepped its constitutionally granted powers.",worldestroyer,2025-04-23T07:43:04,1
