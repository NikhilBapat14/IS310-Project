Is there a Russian presidential election in 2028?,fence_sitter,2025-05-01T13:43:08,37
"Ooh, Tulsi - you should never speak about those kinds of aspirations while the dear leader is still around. And don't forget that MAGA will never accept you as one of their own... you are at most a useful yet disposable tool, and in more ways than one.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T13:46:26,13

"I remember when Tulsi ended Harris‚Äô presidential campaign in a primary debate:  ‚ÄúSenator Harris says she‚Äôs proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she‚Äôll be a prosecutor president. But I‚Äôm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  She blocked evidence ‚Äì she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.‚Äù üó≥Ô∏èüó≥Ô∏èüó≥Ô∏è",cleans01,2025-05-01T16:00:28,3

I think it was 2 - 0. Harris dropped out way early and Tulsi got hers from Guam or Samoa ( maybe? ) silo it wasn't a battle for the ages by any means,SurroundTiny,2025-05-01T16:13:41,1

"More people should run in primaries, not fewer.  Give the people the choice to vote for who they want.  She can't decide to be the nominee. She can only put that choice in the hands of the people.",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-05-01T16:10:25,0
"She can also be an adult and realize that DNC primaries are dominated by registered democratic voters in major cities who are in no way, shape, or form, representative of swing states that actually decide election outcomes. And, coming to terms with that reality, she can step aside so that we actually have a chance at winning in 2028.  Or she be a fucking moron who learns nothing and insists she can absolutely kick the football and bet that Lucy is really being serious when she says she won‚Äôt pull it away this time.",Hello2reddit,2025-05-01T16:16:40,3
"I'm not sure what you're saying, since Democratic primary voters have consistently rejected AOC-like candidates.  Are you saying that the likes of Biden, Hilary, and Obama have not been palatable nominees in swing states?",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-05-01T16:19:52,1
"I‚Äôm saying that women aren‚Äôt palatable to swing state voters, and the only candidate less palatable is a woman of color. As such, for the good of humanity, any decent woman with a modicum of awareness should refrain from throwing their name in for consideration for what ultimately amounts to a very public execution",Hello2reddit,2025-05-01T16:37:05,1
"Seems like a wild stance to say that Democratic primary voters shouldn't have the ability to vote for any women, especially if they are of color.",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-05-01T16:44:44,0
Not what I said.  Please find someone else to explain this to you. I don‚Äôt have the time or the crayons.,Hello2reddit,2025-05-01T16:47:31,2
">any decent woman with a modicum of awareness should refrain from throwing their name in for consideration  If women don't throw their name in for consideration, primary voters don't have the ability to vote for them.  Are you walking back that statement, or declining to follow it to its conclusion?",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-05-01T16:50:52,1
"I certainly dont have the interest in a semantic debate.  The fact that you think that ‚Äúwomen should not run for President right now‚Äù is a ‚Äúwild‚Äù sentiment, perfectly illustrates my point about DNC voters being unrepresentative of swing states.  Anyone who lives in PA, OH, VA, NC, GA, FL, AZ, NV, MI, or WI could tell you this is not a radical idea. It‚Äôs common goddamned sense backed up by two election losses to the single most contemptible candidate in political history.  But hey, refusing to learn anything makes you a damn good contender for a DNC position.",Hello2reddit,2025-05-01T17:03:44,1
