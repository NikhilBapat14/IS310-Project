"> If I was in a foreign country illegally and they gave me a grand to buy a plane ticket home, I'd be appreciative.   If you're in that foreign country because you have a much better life there, maybe you wouldn't be so appreciative.  If the offer is coming from an administration that revels in cruelty toward immigrants and has sent some to a concentration camp where they are to be imprisoned for the rest of their lives with no trial or other due process, you might be even less interested.  > Reddit and their defense of people breaking the law is just weird sometimes.  It only looks like ""defense of people breaking the law"" when you're fully immersed in the dehumanizing rhetoric that the Trump administration and conservative media are pumping out, and when you like the idea of living under a corrupt authoritarian regime so much that you don't care if they deny basic human rights and constitutional rights to the targets of that dehumanizing rhetoric.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-05T12:27:31,2

"The law and the constitution say that nobody should be deprived of due process. Does that matter to you? Do you understand that sending people to prison camps without due process is a dictator move, and then support Trump anyway?  But of course the law matters. Compassion also matters. Every other president, of either party, has deported people but they generally managed to do it *with due process* and *without the sort of cruelty that Trump and the magas celebrate.*  When Trump uses words like ""vermin"" and ""animals"" and ""they're poisoning our blood,"" he's echoing some of the vilest dehumanizing rhetoric in history. Maybe you recognize who said those things first from history class.
