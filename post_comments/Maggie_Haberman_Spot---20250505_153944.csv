I assumed it was her ass since she peddled it to Trump a decade ago and he's been riffing on it ever since. She's high on the list of people I never want to hear from again.,parrot1500,2025-05-05T15:45:11,33
"Trump is an ignorant fool who doesn't know where to draw the line. He can lie all day and all night about ""radical left-wing communist socialist lunatics"", ""DEI hires"", pet-eating immigrants, racist and/or xenophobic tropes, and his ill-informed cult followers will lap it up and echo his nonsense throughout right-wing social media.   But to lie about something as simple as the price of gasoline shows (1) Trump's disrespect for his cult followers, who know what the price of gas is, and (2) how far out of touch with reality King Chump is.   Does anyone think Trump ever drove up to a gas pump in an old F-150 and checked the price of regular unleaded? If so, contact me, I've got a big beautiful bridge to sell you.",Nerd-19958,2025-05-05T15:57:41,11
He thought he could lie about gas prices and nobody would know because he is never exposed to gas prices in his daily life.,30mil,2025-05-05T15:49:48,9
The most surprising place I’d expect to see revolt against Trump would be the New York Times.,bassplayerguy,2025-05-05T17:56:04,6
"From reporter Lee Moran:  The New York Times journalist said she'd ""never seen pushback"" on the president there before.  Haberman noted a rare instance of blowback against Donald Trump from the usually loyal supporters who use his Truth Social platform.  The posts on the president’s platform are “normally very praising of” Trump, she noted while talking to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. “So there is actually a limit to how much he can keep saying that and have his own voters believe him but he right now seems to believe himself.”  Link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maggie-haberman-donald-trump-criticism-base\_n\_681883dde4b0e811371e64b0?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maggie-haberman-donald-trump-criticism-base_n_681883dde4b0e811371e64b0?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-05T15:41:18,1
Maggie Haberman is probably the last person on earth I would ever believe.  She is a steaming pile of horseshit.,LavaRacing,2025-05-05T23:10:18,0
She was one of the top sane washers of Trump. Anyone who kept quiet for years only to write a book when they left Trump’s orbit can also fuck right off.,angrypooka,2025-05-05T19:17:38,10
