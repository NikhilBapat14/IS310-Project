Anyone want to join my new startup that is scientifically proving that God wants us to burn as much coal as possible to mine crypto? I'm expecting some huge government contracts soon.,0002millertime,2025-05-06T13:40:03,15
">Today, it is not hyperbolic to think that America’s global advantage in science is coming to an end, the product of a bevy of aggressive attacks from the federal government on its own agencies and other public and private institutions.   >These attacks will likely thin the American scientific workforce across many subfields in coming years. And they’ve already caused one scientific journal to pause submissions of new studies. This motivates a thought experiment around how a shrunken scientific enterprise in the United States will look.",nimicdoareu,2025-05-06T13:35:24,10

"I keep posting this.  My fiancé and I are leaving next year.  Personally, I am an engineer that came from Scotland via Canada and my sig other is a double doctor (PhD wrapping up this year), who works for a major hospital in a blue state (online) as well as a couple of other clinics (also online).  We have applied to Ireland and are actively wrapping things up here in the USA to head out.  The kicker to this is that HR where she works and asked about working internationally told her that 75% of the female doctors made such calls to them, and this was about 2 months ago.  No idea what the number is now.  The thing is that people that are educated and necessary here in the USA have the means to leave and be welcome pretty much anywhere in the world.    Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Italy, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, etc.  They have all reached out and are setting up relocation incentives for educated people to leave the country.  Especially in the Technology, Medical and Research fields.  Smart countries are poaching the best out of the USA because of the turmoil and in a very short time the USA will be at the bottom for research, tech, etc.    But the powers that be want it that way.  Cheaper labor is the under educated masses.  Good luck being able to see a doctor face to face (yeah this means surgeries, etc.), in the very near future.  It is already very time consuming to see doctors especially specialists.  It is amazing how bad its gotten in just a few months but we don't want to be on the rollercoaster wondering if I might get deported (US Citizen), or her rights get pulled away (female).",No-Cut-6501,2025-05-06T14:12:56,6
"Its grim, with direct cuts impacting research the indirect effect is that the businesses supporting that research will die as well. The expectation was private industry would fill in, the reality is private industry cand afford the numbers the federal government spent. This compounds our economic problems further.",toxic_badgers,2025-05-06T14:28:46,2
