I've been having this discussion with friends. TP is an American product probably still going to have shortages though. When people see barren shelves they buy TP. It's a mental stock piling.,Faucet860,2025-04-27T20:23:22,34

"Part of the ‚Äòdeal‚Äô was also that (broadly speaking) most of the West follows along politically with America too, particularly when it comes to things like sanctions.   It‚Äôs hard to put an exact dollar value on the  hegemony and soft power the US has ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm pretty sure it will be missed when it‚Äôs gone.  Good point about military bases. A heck of a lot of Americas vaunted power projection and logistical capability rests on having a global network of bases in friendly nations.

Well might I recommend looking into the time impact of tariffs are felt. We just now started getting empty boats. That will be really seen on May 10th. Soon truck drivers are going to be let go. Then 45 days from that once trains run empty you'll see Midwest and Eastern truck drivers losing jobs. 6% of the population works in truck driving.,Faucet860,2025-04-27T19:20:41,9
