Best case scenario Trump leaves office in 2029 willingly surrendering the presidency to a democrat after a free and fair election. In subsequent elections Republicans try to continue doing the MAGA thing and lose for 2 or 3 elections making it clear that it only really worked for Trump and it's time to move on.   More realistically 2029 is not the end of this. There will be measures in place to keep MAGA in power regardless of who people vote for. Either they change election law or just refuse to hold or honor elections. Things will get bad at an exponential rate. I don't know what the tipping point will be but I plan to be on another continent when it happens if I can.,Prince_Marf,2025-03-17T00:40:42,297

"Right now, the two political parties are realigning. In the realignment, anyone still practicing traditional Republican conservativism is currently completely homeless. If you believe in light intervention in the economy, a robust military with strong international alliances, mildly conservative social beliefs, but generally want a functional and fair democracy and they're not into an imperial presidency, you are completely out in the cold. MAGA wants nothing to do with you, and the Democratic party is only slightly less hostile.  A lot of these people are just not voting now.   I don't know. The political parties are going to keep shifting I think. Eventually someone with a plan and coherent ideology is going to take over from Trump. I suspect that's going to set the final course for how the parties break down. I suspect it's going to end up as right wing populism built around patronage that ejects the free market business folks and national security conservatives.   I suspect that the Democrats will only become more incoherent as one part of the party wants to be more progressive, while the other half for the party is being dragged the other direction by people that would have been Republicans in the 2000s who want to focus less on niche social concerns and are more worried about the economy.  Neither end of the party can afford to jettison the other, but it makes the Democrats incoherent and disunified, often blocking themselves.",Rindan,2025-03-17T00:40:24,22

I do think that when Trump leaves office though, MAGA will linger around for another few years but ultimately die off by 2030.   MAGA does not represent Republicans. MAGA represents a subset of republicans - the extreme far right ones - and like all extremists, it's anyone's guess how long MAGA will truly be around but, again...

"American Presidents might not like Supreme Court decisions, but most since Andrew Jackson haven’t bragged about defying its rulings. Not even Donald Trump. Then there’s President Biden, who, while canceling more student debt this week, boasted about ignoring the Supreme Court’s landmark 2023 ruling that his previous loan forgiveness plan was illegal.  Speaking Feb. 21 in Culver City, Calif., Mr. Biden said his original plan to “provide millions of working families with debt relief for their college student debt” was derailed by “MAGA Republicans” and “special interests” who challenged the plan in court. “The Supreme Court blocked it,” Mr. Biden added, “but that didn’t stop me.” He apparently thinks defying the law is a virtue.  https://thefacts.com/opinion/another-viewpoint-biden-blatantly-ignores-supreme-court/article_649c4d89-83d3-59cd-8c4a-e48e648f9ab2.html",Alive_Shoulder3573,2025-03-18T09:42:05,1

(1) He dies, and Vance isn't able to accomplish the same undemocrafic things because he lacks Trump's *je ne sais quoi.* Trump is on track to be the oldest president in history. Natural causes are not out of the question.   (2) They massively miscalculate 2026. Maybe not likely but it's what Im banking on. 2026 is going to be delicate for them because they are still testing the waters to see what they can get away with. If there is any democratic process at all in 2026 democrats will retake the House and possibly the Senate. The question is whether they can get away with election interference, whether they will feel the need to, and whether they can get away with election denial.   They may actually overstep before 2026 and lose the presumption that they could defy court orders. They may fear an overstep and fail to implement measures to prevent a 2026 loss. They may bank on their ability to deny election results and that may fail. It is likely that soldiers or national guards would defy orders to prevent new congresspeople from taking office. There are a lot of questions at play and a lot of ways things could not work out for them.

Even with the usual voter suppression fuckery and other Republican mischief, the way things are already so unpopular, Dems ought to be able to take back the House in the mid-terms. The Senate is the bigger question. If the Dems could make bigger gains in the Senate, I wouldn’t write off the possibility of a third impeachment. And, if that were to happen, it things had gotten that bad by then, they might just get rid of him.  Of course, in that scenario, the country would likely be in pretty piss poor shape by then, which lends itself to many ugly alternative scenarios as well.

"Really anywhere you can find a long term stable situation. It's tough to get residency in most countries if you do not already have a job lined up. I am currently working on transitioning my career to work from home so that I will not be immediately alienated from income if I choose to leave at a moment's notice. If you're like me and English monolingual then [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population) can be useful. You want somewhere with high English speakers per capita.  UK is my top choice currently because I have some family there and might be able to get a long term work or student visa. Most European countries have a good English speaker rate and high standard of living but can be hard to get into. Unfortunately most places on Earth you also have to take the way you look and the relative danger into account. There are a lot of places that are decently safe and have low cost of living but I don't trust crime rate figures alone because they don't factor in the fact that you can be a target if you don't look like a native. Gender and sexuality of course play a role as well. If you are not straight or a woman you might want to avoid the Middle East. Singapore is the best destination in Asia for English speakers but Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong are good places to live if you can deal with the language barrier. Thailand as well I think? Haven't looked into it yet. The Philippines appeals to me for its high rate of English speakers but I have been explicitly told by Filipinos that I could be a target for crime for not looking like a native. Australia and New Zealand have basically the same analysis as Europe, and the Spanish-speaking world has a lot of good options if you can get past that language barrier.  Your family status is huge because it can be hard to get permanent residence for everyone, but at the same time with a married couple often one working domestically is enough to get long term residence for both. If you intend to take your pets you might be required to send them through quarantine.  Also consider places where locals will actually want you. I wouldn't consider this a dispositive factor but you want to be able to get along with people. It's not good to contribute to existing housing crises but at the same time there is a scarcity of housing almost everywhere it's nice to live, and a scarcity of safe, quality housing everywhere else. But it's important to get a feel online for the general vibe toward Americans right now. Locals being annoyed by Americans is preferable to them being hostile.",Prince_Marf,2025-03-17T10:08:17,5

"The trajectory the Trump administration is on, it seems inevitable that there will be an inflection point that produces dramatic shifts in how Americans respond to what is happening in our country.  As you have said, what Republicans are trying to do is a ""delicate maneuver"", and they're being led in that effort by a man with no understanding of nuance, tact or strategic thinking. So it seems likely that there will be a point where they overreach in an absurd fashion.   The question is, how will the citizens respond? Mass protests seem like the most likely answer, and as always, those will produce some violence. How the Trump administration responds to that will the crucial test, and I doubt anybody expects Trump to be measured in his actions. In 2020 his instinct was to hide in his bunker and demand to know why protestors could not be ""shot in the legs"". But that was before the Supreme Court ruled on Presidential immunity and he still had sensible professionals in his inner circle.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-03-17T10:38:56,17

"Not sure what's 'riddance dollars' means. But you're basically asking if I think politicians would actually tell voters that they will increase their taxes, right?   I mean, no that would be a tough sell. They could just lie and say they're going to get taxes down. Then, if voted into office, raise taxes on people anyway.   From my understanding of the deficit it really started piling up after 9/11. The G. W. Bush tax cuts helped the wealthy, but more importantly the Bush administration spending was out of control i.e. added to the deficit significantly ( this is debated by the heritage foundation, go figure). I believe Obama extended those George w Bush tax cuts (rich get richer). Trump's 2017 tax act helped the top 1% even more. The government has been prioritizing the wealthiest of the wealthy for decades.   Now we get the richest man in the world and his paw patrol to look for the most woke sounding projects to focus on, even if they're lies. Doge is ruining shit.   There's no need to increase taxes on anyone except the super rich.

"there were loan forgiveness possibilities to individual loan owners, but what he did was trying to do was wiping billions of dollars with a swipe of his own, which he was told multiple times that it was unconstitutional but he kept ignoring the court orders and trying multiple times to see what schemes he could pass by their court orders",Alive_Shoulder3573,2025-03-19T13:38:51,1

"So he tried more than once? If he didn’t respect their decision then why were loans NOT forgiven? Believe it or not, college graduates who require student loans are not in the upper class. They’re in the middle class. Biden was working to support the middle class. Something that Republicans only claim to do, while gutting Social Security, dismantling the VA, and giving tax cut to the ultrarich.",neomal,2025-03-18T09:39:58,1
there are thousands of white rich liberals making hundreds of thousands yearly that have refused to pay back their student loans because they were led to believe that biden would forgive their debts.  why should regular middle class folks that did not take out SL be forced to pay off their debts?,Alive_Shoulder3573,2025-03-18T09:47:29,0
