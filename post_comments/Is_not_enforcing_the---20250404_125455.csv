"I think that the general argument around border law enforcement is that with limited resources, we have to decide where to focus them. So, some types of activities or people might not be actively pursued in favor of higher priorities.   So, going after “dreamers” or folks just working and not causing issues aren’t important enough to get focus.  The Tiktok ban isn’t that at all. Enforcing the duly passed law wouldn’t take significant resources on the part of the federal government. There’s not really a valid reason for not enforcing it aside from “trump doesn’t want to” and allowing him to just ignore laws is yet another way that the corruption eats the system.  There’s no real pushback as essentially no one in power really thinks that tiktok is a serious national security threat; it was all political posturing, so they’re happy to allow it to avoid the consequences to their actions in this instance.",CaffinatedOne,2025-04-04T14:06:04,37
"For Trump, not enforcing the ban on TikTok is his way of advertising that he's open for bribery to turn a blind eye to it. As soon as the right offer, with the right # of zeroes on the check comes in, this too will be memory-holed, just like his claims to cut egg prices & end the Ukraine conflict ""on day 1"" have been.",ActualSpiders,2025-04-04T13:58:13,29
"There was a provision in the law that allowed for an extension if a buyer was imminent. As of now, I'm not aware of the law ""not being enforced"", it's being applied exactly as intended.  That being said, even if Trump never enforces the law, it's still going to be effectively banned anyways. The law doesn't ban Tiktok, it bans app stores distributing it with massive per-user fines if they do. Also the statute of limitations was set such that the next president would still be able to prosecute and collect on those fines  Meaning that even if Trump said it's a stupid law and was going to ignore it, Google and Apple need to think real hard on the likelihood of the next president having the same opinion. The safe bet would be to not risk it and band the app yourself anyways.",kormer,2025-04-04T16:00:53,2
"Everyone is dodging the question, but yes.      Laws are laws. They're supposed to serve America's interest. In the event the president feels it does otherwise, they're supposed to put efforts to address rather than quietly allow the law to be broken. This is no different to how Democrats rarely enforce immigration laws.      It isn't good either. It invalidates important to enforce laws, it also devalues future proposed laws. There are things that are supposed to be sacred and politics kinda serves to do the opposite in America (politics makes things less sacred).      I am biased of course, but I'm for the ban. As boomer of me as it is, I grew up to see what the TV slop and video game slop did to America; it wasn't good. We made fun of older generations, but they were right, TV and video games were bad for us, and Tik Tok has sciences *now* saying it's worse. We should be putting effort into learning how to teach children to navigate a world full of distractions, we should at least temporarily ban some media so we can effectively find a way to develop society around slop. Instead, we use in had faith ""freedom of speech"" as a reason to not suppress entertainment essentially bad for us. A middle ground would be to not ban anything but find solutions with our educational system, but we are putting no effort using a teaching structure only mildly updated to accommodate new technology for teaching, but not teaching students how to survive the new world with said technology. Things are gonna be real bad, like Japan bad, where the elderly is asked to come back to work bad. ",RexDraco,2025-04-04T14:08:46,0

"It's not about monitoring what you watch... it's controlling what you see. TikTok intentionally blocks truth that could be ""damaging"" to the CCP. They hide videos that work against the Chinese agenda and promote those that are beneficial.  The blatant manipulation creates a narrative that the CCP can use to build favorable views against their terrible crimes against humanity.  TikTok also uses a feature called ""Focused View"" this feature uses your front camera to track your eyes for the screen, so the app knows when you are not being engaged. The CCP is known to save facial scans to compile biometrical data. They catalogue this data for public tracking in security cameras.  TikTok argues the face scanning is only to make sure you are paying attention, to tune the next video you see if you stop watching the screen, but it is impossible to not also scan your entire face with the LiDar tech your front camera uses, this is how your phone unlocks without a password.. it is measuring your face.  They use the Chinese people's biometrics to provide easy access to trains, atms, and social credit scores. If you do something the CCP doesn't like, they make it so your face triggers declines in ATM access, taxi's, trains, and even target your employment for hiring ""unscrupulous"" people. It's all about controlling the masses by collecting their data.  On top of all of this, once a company has your facial biometrics it is easy to find you, where ever you are, and spoof you're identity through generative Ai.  This is why there is concern, TikTok is compiling biometric data and intentionally feeding a large population of Americans CCP propaganda.

If you are happy with an AI answer on a search engine and curated media on TikTok, that's fine, but dangerous. People should have access to as much information as possible to deduce real truths. If you don't know where the answers come from, you can't trust them.  The whole point is to build a huge group of Americans that are sympathetic to Chinese ideals; numbed by the disinformation and complacent to the media control of the CCP. If a large group of people are convinced the American gov't is the problem, the propaganda did it's job.",Turds4Cheese,2025-04-04T16:48:31,1
They didn't really say no crimes. Just that the idea that immigrants add crime to our communities is a propaganda point.   Crime exists regardless of immigration status and rates. And Americans commit the most crimes.   So these people aren't more dangerous and they don't make the communities they live in less safe on their own.,DreamingMerc,2025-04-04T17:28:15,3

Also, what Russia used isn't just plain ol' propaganda or just older forms of  information warfare, but also ***memetic warfare***, i.e., use the inherent near-life properties of information to effectively hack the minds of so many Americans, made especially vulnerable due to the GOP creating the fertile soil for it to really sprout.     Here's the sad thing: you can't use traditional countermeasures against memetic warfare, hell, it's something of a losing battle with information warfare.

If you come in illegally and then you commit a crime then you are by definition adding crime to the community. The crime wouldn’t have happened if they weren’t here or detained or deported.   Obviously Americans commit crimes in America….like……  Also you would need to show proof that they didn’t add more crime to communities.

YOU suggested that the decision of the Biden administration to ignore immigration law is no different than Trump seeming to ignore the ban of tiktok.   I am suggesting that those things have completely different outcomes. Biden's decision has caused problems, Trump's may cause problems in the future but really hasn't as yet.  Also, the national security threat of tiktok is one that is identified and claimed by the intelligence services, of which Trump is now in charge. So if Trump wants to hold it up then he is effectively speaking for the intelligence services.   The border on the other hand was shit show of drug smuggling, child trafficking, extortion, death, and human suffering. Joe let it happen and pretended that there was no solution without Congress. And yet here we are 3 months later and Trump has it under control without Congress.",mskmagic,2025-04-05T02:32:07,1

Pulling secret service security for recently retired/fired four star generals/joint chiefs/national security advisors, etc., especially when someone was arrested over the last few years for plotting to murder John Bolton, is crazy.

The point is that the supposed fear mongering of migrants is both absurd and built on ignoring the crime Americans just do.
