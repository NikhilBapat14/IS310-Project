"**Summary**: Over 100 U.S. university presidents, including leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Brown, jointly condemned the Trump administration’s ""**unprecedented overreach**"" into higher education, calling it **political interference**. The statement, organized by the AAC&U, follows Harvard’s lawsuit against $2.3B in frozen funds and demands to cede autonomy. Schools resist measures like DEI bans, faculty oversight, and international student restrictions, warning of threats to academic freedom. The unified pushback signals **escalating defiance** against what they call an **assault on institutional independence**.",pharrt,2025-04-21T23:15:03,12

"As leaders of America’s colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education. We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.     America’s system of higher learning is as varied as the goals and dreams of the students it serves. It includes research universities and community colleges; comprehensive universities and liberal arts colleges; public institutions and private ones; freestanding and multi-site campuses. Some institutions are designed for all students, and others are dedicated to serving particular groups. Yet, American institutions of higher learning have in common the essential freedom to determine, on academic grounds, whom to admit and what is taught, how, and by whom. Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.     Because of these freedoms, American institutions of higher learning are essential to American prosperity and serve as productive partners with government in promoting the common good. Colleges and universities are engines of opportunity and mobility, anchor institutions that contribute to economic and cultural vitality regionally and in our local communities. They foster creativity and innovation, provide human resources to meet the fast-changing demands of our dynamic workforce, and are themselves major employers. They nurture the scholarly pursuits that ensure America’s leadership in research, and many provide healthcare and other essential services. Most fundamentally, America’s colleges and universities prepare an educated citizenry to sustain our democracy.     The price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society. On behalf of our current and future students, and all who work at and benefit from our institutions, we call for constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.

"I don’t care if the democratic nominee had been a fire ant that came and bit my arm every single day, I still would have voted for it instead of what we have now. There’s no excuse for not voting in especially high stakes elections on how bad a candidate is when the other option is intent on destroying the country and becoming a dictator.  I don’t give a crap if the nominee wasn’t as perfect as you wanted or if you don’t like them much, I’ll absolutely blame “apathetic voters” because they’re actively supporting this by not standing against it. There’s no “well I didn’t vote for it so it’s not my fault.” Not stopping something if you have the power to is a choice and if you don’t make it then you are just as responsible as the guilty party.   If I have the power to stop someone from breaking into your house by calling the police or stopping them myself or something and stop them from assaulting you and destroying everything you own but I don’t because I just happen to not like you as a neighbor, is that still fine? Because you didn’t perform to my expectations on what I think you should be like, I should let horrible things happen to you? Sure, I’m not actively doing the robbing or assaulting but it’s my fault I ignored your suffering because I didn’t value the basic morality in stopping bad people or bad things. I could have stopped it but I couldn’t bother myself in doing so because you annoyed me somehow or I think you’re not a good person.   That’s how people who don’t vote are. Just going “it’s got nothing to do with me, they should have been better” doesn’t mean you didn’t neglect your chance to stand up and defend the right thing or that you’re somehow excused from supporting it by not opposing it. You are as culpable as the people doing wrong. If you’re fine with that, that’s your choice and you’re allowed to do so, but don’t act like it’s anything less than enabling and selfish. People who don’t stand against horrific acts inadvertently side with them. Ever heard “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor”? It’s a saying for a reason. That’s you.   Again, that’s your right as a person but you don’t get to act like it’s someone else’s fault besides your own that you allow horrible things to happen because someone doesn’t pass your purity tests. Was I super happy with the choices? No. But again, it doesn’t matter who it was if they were better than Trump and they were.  Every thing he does now, every person he hurts, that’s partially on you and history will judge it as such the same way they judged people who stood back and didn’t even attempt to stop all the horrors of history. The people who didn’t support Hitler but didn’t try to help hide Jewish people, that’s you. The people who didn’t support slavery but never did anything to try and help slaves even if the solution wasn’t perfect, that’s you. People who “thoughts and prayers” kids at school shooters but don’t vote for sensible gun control, that’s you (not in actual policy but in concept). You sided with the oppressor because unless results were exactly what you wanted it wasn’t good enough to even try, and you made everything you pretend you care about worse (the genocide you protest so much sure is better now, yeah? Not like it’s still going on AND even more suffering is happening, nooo and student opinions and critics are sure doing well right now, this is so much better letting this happen because you didn’t want to try and make things better slowly you just gave up on it all) in every way because you took your ball and went home. Abstaining from action because you don’t like the choices makes you responsible for them too. Sorry you can’t understand that basic history lesson.  Maybe one day you’ll grow up and understand the damage you’ve done but right now you just seem like a spoiled hypocritical brat. The world can never become a better place if everyone is like you, apathetic to people’s suffering so you can claim your false moral high ground in your safe little world instead of actually doing anything helpful, so I pray you become the minority and people actually care about the world around them in the future.",Lostsock1995,2025-04-22T03:38:31,21

Harris was CLEARLY the better option, America just failed the test.   And if you want to make yourself a 1-issue voter, that’s fine. You could certainly find worse causes to advocate for than ending genocide. But in case you haven’t paid attention, shit in Gaza is as bad or worse than it was while Biden was in office. So with the benefit of hindsight, our options were 1) support a party that is too close with Israel and is complicit in some nasty stuff; or 2) support a party that is even worse for Gaza while also fucking over all of us here at home, too.
