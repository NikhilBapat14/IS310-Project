Because both houses are a slim majority. Congress is already cumbersome as hell with a strong majority.  The framers didn't design Congress to legislation  at this level because the federal government isn't supposed to have this much power.,akbuilderthrowaway,2025-04-24T17:18:02,54
Congress has be useless since Obama probably before that. To many ways to block bills with filibusters and stuff and it’s basically just a partisan bickering match. Literally the only way they get laws passed is through spending bills cause they have the threat of a shutdown.,Graardors-Dad,2025-04-24T17:11:59,12

I'm speaking more to the minutia... Like are certified copies free? Do I actually have to provide certified copies of my marriage license and any divorce decrees to obtain these IDs? Some states don't offer programs to help homebound individuals...   I'm with you I just think this shouldn't have any friction that way the other side doesn't have any argument and we can finally get this done.,GorillaHeat,2025-04-25T05:14:20,7

That's a key point. The framers weren't really keen on government doing much beyond absolute necessity. The fact that we have as many laws and regulation as we do is a big part of what has gone wrong with the country.,According-Activity87,2025-04-24T17:29:23,49
"Yup, the federal system was designed to only manage the bare minimum of government functions. A lot of the framers of the constitution were against the general welfare clause because it would lead to government involvement in things like education.",Menhadien,2025-04-24T18:03:48,16
SCOTUS is supposed to deliberate about the limits of the authority federal district judges have around the middle of next month. Surely they realize these judges overstepping their bounds has caused them all manner of headaches this year.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T18:15:54,32
Because we don't really have those things. I'd be willing to bet only two SCOTUS justices even voted for Trump in the election. And the majority of congress certainly didn't.,day25,2025-04-24T21:19:57,7

there is no national id  elections are administered by the states  show me a state that makes it hard to get an id  the burden of proof is on you  - prove your thesis  I already eliminated one state AL,lousycesspool,2025-04-25T12:41:10,1
"if you are going to require it nationally then we are going to be talking about national minimal standards that states will have to rise to, all of them.  we cant just say everyone must show ID and thats the end of it.  Wyoming for example has a free voter ID, great.  in order to get it you have to provide documents that are not free to attain.  Now i believe in personal responsibility and people should be able to cough up 25 bucks for the birth certificate.  if youre serious about voting, make it happen.  but thats the argument that is keeping it from happening.  I think there hould be a program in place where people who qualify for assistance qualify for free access to records once per year or every two years.  some states require marriage documents to be supplied to prove name changes.  that added cost of pulling documents you may not have and added time will add up.  personally i would go through all of this red tape because i proudly vote... but at some point hinderances can become obstacles for others.  I think in the name of giving no one any fucking excuses, grease the rails on getting IDs for free without added expense or copious amounts of time, and then demand ID at the poll.  also, to be clear... whether or not its ""hard"" to obtain ID is somewhat subjective.",GorillaHeat,2025-04-25T18:24:36,3
">  we cant just say everyone must show ID and thats the end of it.  I'm guessing you haven't heard of REAL ID the national standard ...  throw up all the strawmen* you want getting an id is neither expensive nor difficult  In the time you have been bickering with me about it I could have acquired an id  *if you don't have a valid voter id in WY you're not able to work, eat or travel You're not interested   >     WY Driver's License or ID Card     Tribal ID Card     Valid US Passport     US Military Card     DL or ID Card from Another State     University of Wyoming Student ID     Wyoming Community College Student ID     Wyoming Public School Student ID     Valid Medicare Insurance Card*     Valid Medicaid Insurance Card*     Valid Wyoming Concealed Firearm Permit   If you do not have one of the documents in the list above, you may obtain a free Wyoming Identification Card from your local Driver Services office.",lousycesspool,2025-04-25T19:34:52,0
"All of those cost money except the voter ID, but to get the voter ID you have to provide documents that are absolutely not free.   I'm not sure you're reading the things that I'm saying or at least not reading them in their entirety. I agree that getting a voter ID is to some degree not an impossible affair... I wouldn't even claim it's NOT hard but other people living in different situations - they would make different claims and that's what you're up against. I say actually do something and solve it and make it easier make the documents free to obtain and get the rest of the states to do a free voter ID. Streamline the process so it's easier.    I am not refuting any argument other than the one we are discussing. Strawman is an  incorrect term for what is happening here. You think the argument I'm making is weak and thats fine but no one is offering strawmen.   And when I say we can't just demand ID and that's the end of it I mean we need to support the policy. Educate the populace with how easy it is to do... Reach out as best as possible to alert all citizens in ways that actually reach the citizens... Help people who can't afford the different steps towards getting an ID like finding a birth certificate which is almost never free in this country.     I appreciate the discussion. I won't annoy you any further with my opinion.    Cheers",GorillaHeat,2025-04-25T20:02:21,3
> Educate the populace  Are they babies? if by voting age you can't figure out how to get an id for the big cost of $25... how did you graduate from High School? How did you make an informed decision on who /what to vote for?  watch Ami's on the street interviews  President Bush - The soft b-gotry of low expectations.  these are strawman arguments :  identification is hard to get - actually it's not  documents to get an id are expensive - they are not - they are often free AND necessary for everyday life  getting to the place to get an id is to expensive / cumbersome / difficult - no its not   voters want to vote but can't because they don't know how to get an id? - seriously,lousycesspool,2025-04-26T03:17:15,2
We absolutely can demand ID for all manner of government interactions and voter ID is a base tenant of conservative thought.   I think you're in the wrong sub.,TedriccoJones,2025-04-28T20:37:15,1
I guess the intent isn't coming through easily in  what I'm saying... We can't just change it up in places where this has never been the case without making it as easy as possible for everyone to get voter ID. I just think ID should be free for everyone Including the documents needed to attain ID that way there's no argument to be had here because I agree ID is a good thing. They're going to win this argument in the long run if we don't make it as easy as possible for people to get them.    Now I currently find it easy to get one but someone in a different situation doesn't.  I say take away the excuses. make birth certificates free to attain once a year or every other year that way you can at least take away the major talking point of these people.    Why not?,GorillaHeat,2025-04-29T05:52:24,1
