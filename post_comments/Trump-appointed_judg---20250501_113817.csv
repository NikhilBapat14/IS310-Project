"> Allowing the President to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch’s authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute’s scope  Exactly, thank you, judge. Trump’s sudden declaration that we are at war with Venezuela and have been invaded, when that is not the case, is Orwellian. I’m glad a court finally said he isn’t allowed to just unilaterally say we are at war. ",Donkletown,2025-05-01T11:47:41,3500
