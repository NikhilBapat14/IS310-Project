"Trump is doing basically the number one things presidents are NOT supposed to do, blatantly ripping off us, his constituents, for his own personal benefit. He should be removed from office immediately.",joeleidner22,2025-04-10T10:11:50,14
It's not just the people close to him but anyone that listens to him. He is trying to demonstrate that  if you blindly follow him you will be rewarded. He is manipulating the population into sheep. He is trying to destroy the moral fabric of the nation. Listen to the tryant and you will get rich. It's an abuse of power.,Appointment_Relevant,2025-04-10T09:39:16,13
It's a pump and dump scheme using the U.S. economy,BrimstoneMainliner,2025-04-10T10:10:30,11
Trump wants our trade partners to beg him to negotiate trade agreements.  It is not about making America great but about making him feel superior to other nations. He is not doing this for the people of this nation but manipulating stock trading. He loves every minute the media (fake or otherwise) fall over backward to keep his name in the headlines.,JetCityMom,2025-04-10T10:49:38,11

"Please keep banging this drum till it breaks. When the ""common man"" feels the pain of Trump's corruption - because clearly your average Trump supporter isn't offended by administrative incompetence, illegal deportations and accelerating climate change - when they see they're being bankrupted only to line Trump's tallow-fat greasy pockets, maybe THEN we'll get somewhere with these folks.",GarthZorn,2025-04-10T10:15:41,10

"Trump may not be but everyone around him certainly is. All they have to do is tell ateump to do it and he will. They most certainly set up the stock market to tank in order to buy low.
