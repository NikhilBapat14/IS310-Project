"I disagree with Bernie and AOC on most stuff,  but they're defining that party because they're the only ones standing up and offering ideas and goals(dumb ones but that isn't the point).  If moderate Dems don't want their party defined by the extreme left, they need to be getting in front on cameras and crowds explaining what they support and how it'll benefit people/the country.",NotRadTrad05,2025-04-26T16:25:07,21
"For months now, I have observed and commented on the steady and clear collapse of the Democratic Party.   Their energies are consumed almost entirely with hatred of one individual man, rather than any constructive vision for the republic’s future.   Their talk is insanely hollow, given over to slogans like “dismantle the oligarchy” and “down with the elites,” which may rouse the passions of the radical factions but alienate the reasoned judgment of the moderate citizenry (who are the fastest growing group and majority!).  Their hypocrisy is so evident when they traverse the continent on private jets at a cost of $15,000 an hour between their crusades *against* privilege. It’s insane.  The party has ceased to be a body animated by any *principle*.   It has become a loose collection of single issue causes, lacking any coherent spirit to guide it, and the only path seems to be increasingly radicalizing brainwashed followers because all else is lost. It sucks. I mean it really sucks to watch.  The republic was *never* meant to be chained to two factions alone. A healthy republic depends on the vitality of multiple parties, lest we decay into a de facto single party rule, which is the surest path to despotism over time.  That figures like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez now wage open rebellion *against their own party* is just proof of the rot within.   Though many in conservative circles may take a gleeful or vengeful pleasure in seeing the Democratic establishment weakened by its internal strife, a true friend of the constitution must resist that temptation. The preservation of democracy rests not upon the fortunes of any party, but upon the maintenance of political integrity and the legitimacy of our institutions under the Constitution. Full stop.  Many are so ensnared by the spirit of opposition on both sides that they forget the very document that gives our union its meaning. It is not the triumph of one party, but the fidelity to the Constitution, that must command our allegiance.  I’ll get off my soapbox, but it needs to be said.",Blarghnog,2025-04-27T01:54:27,4
"Yes, yes please let them.  Because you just KNOW they will take the party so far left that hardly anyone will vote for them.",mdws1977,2025-04-26T13:08:42,5
