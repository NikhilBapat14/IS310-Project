"Yup. So‚Ä¶all of that is true. Only discussion is a debate on policy but the illegality of actions is clear.  What do we do when heads of major agencies violate their oath of office and knowingly violate the US constitution, endangering national security in the process?",hammilithome,2025-05-08T18:06:08,206

That was so well thought out and delivered by Murphy. This video clip needs to go viral.,jaxiepie7,2025-05-08T18:54:44,137
"They keep saying that she is breaking the law, that Trump is breaking the law and that they cannot do these things but who the hell is stopping them? Nobody, nobody is stopping them. They are blatantly ignoring the laws and the constitution and nobody is doing a goddamn thing about it. This is so fucking frustrating. Who would have thought that it would be this easy to just take over the country, break every law in sight and just keep their fucking jobs and thumb their noses at everyone. This is truly some mind blowing shit.",SnooStories4162,2025-05-08T19:43:03,96

The constitution defines America and its citizens. If you disagree with the law you‚Äôll have to ask the lawmakers to change it first. Unless they change it you‚Äôre obligated to follow the law. If you disagree with the constitution you need to move to another country.,Potato2266,2025-05-08T20:13:38,14

"This is what gets me.  Our democracy is like a jenga tower. Every day Trump and his crooked team are pulling blocks from the bottom of the tower, and it's only a matter of time before the the whole thing collapses.   People don't seem to realize that's it not hyperbole. It's not an exaggeration. Tump is literally paving the way for fascism.  Like, it's actually happening.   Because it's so dear to me, I focus a lot on how this all affects black people.  Trump is racist. Echoes all the talking points of the dixiecrats.  Calls any accomplishment black people made DEI. Wants to white wash history. Passed an EO that defunds schools that teach about how race played a part in American history. Wants to drastically remodel the African history museum to reflect a pro American message. This man will indeed legalize segregation. I absolutely believe he's planning on it.",SapToFiction,2025-05-09T09:10:05,2
