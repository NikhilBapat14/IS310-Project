"By James Bickerton - US News Reporter:   A tense meeting last week between Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman and a delegation from a teachers union ended with one of his staffers in tears according to the Associated Press news agency, escalating growing concerns over the Democratic lawmaker's mental health and behavior just three years after suffering a life-threatening stroke.  Newsweek has reached out to John Fetterman's office for comment via email on Thursday outside of regular office hours.

It's judging a book by its cover rather than the contents.   I think John is wearing a costume when he purposefully dresses the way he does in the same way someone is when they dress business casual. He's doing it to make a point and he wants to appeal to the ""every man"", basically. If this was just the way he dressed, it wouldn't be a big deal to just wear different clothes when you're a senator.

"To provide a genuine answer:  The growing consensus is that Fetterman experienced major personality changes as a consequence of his stroke.  Those changes underpin both a shift in his political positions, from left to right; and what appears to be increasingly concerning behavior in his personal life.  As an aside:  Having both experienced a brain injury of my own, and witnessed the results of stroke damage in others - Fetterman, and his colleagues and loved ones, have my deepest sympathies.  That said, Democrats pulling their support for the Senator is understandable; and there’s a growing argument to be made that he is no longer fit to serve in office.  I hope that Fetterman is able to find the help he needs, and live out his life without further issue.

No one could have known in what way or to what degree Fetterman would have been effected by the stroke.
