"That doesn‚Äôt make it not true. The US no doubt could survive without Israel but if Israel is important enough to the US where Israel‚Äôs influence dictates what the US says and does, then they got the US by the balls. An analogy: two people in a relationship can break up and they‚Äôd be okay but if one of them is accustomed to a certain lifestyle that the other provides, they may be willing to make certain concessions for the other partner.",Colifama55,2025-05-01T18:23:44,6
"Look, as a person who believes that Israel has a right to exist.  It does have a degree of control on the US though..and now even more so.. much more under Donald Trump.  AIPAC. (American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) : They're one of if not the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With Citizens United and foreign money now pouring in, Israel can have an almost direct impact on elections. Two Pro-Palestinian incumbents Democratic US House Representatives lost in Democratic primaries because AIPAC made them literally the most expensive primary House races in history. This obviously sends a loud and clear message to others.  Bibi's been a giant pain in the ass for the Biden administration in 2024, and half the reason for him coming here in Summer 2024 was to help Trump get elected.",sereneandeternal,2025-05-01T18:57:49,4

">AIPAC. (American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) : They're one of if not the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With Citizens United and foreign money now pouring in, Israel can have an almost direct impact on elections.  That's not how PACs or Citizens United work. Could a foreign country be illegally back channeling money into an organization? Yes. Is that legal? No. AIPAC's money is from US citizens who support Israel and those donations require documentation.   Repealing Citizen's United wouldn't do anything to stop the kind of activity you are speculating about because that kind of activity isn't legal even under Citizen's United.",thrawtes,2025-05-01T19:47:55,0

It certainly appears to be. That was one of the complaints that was glossed over during the first signal leak. Those chats were all set to delete after 4 weeks.,Coherent_Tangent,2025-05-02T06:30:15,1
