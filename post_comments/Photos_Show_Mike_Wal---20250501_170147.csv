"Oh this is *delicious.* A communication platform already under fire, caught on HD camera, and a *third party backup app* serving as an archive mechanism. More, it includes Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, and JD Vance. It has the VPOTUS stating a mystery “counterpart” turned something off and “will be here.” “Here” meaning wherever JD Vance was physically located at the time - so verifiable? AND the newly named Secretary of State, NSA, USAID, US Archives Chief (Rubio) saying “hope there’s time” (forrr?) AND the third-party archiving appears to be recently installed based on the banner!?   The only way this could have been better were if Hegseth was there.  Edit: Using the top to echo a comment from down below: “This isn’t an administration, it’s a bunch of foreign governments stacked inside a trench coat.”",holymolybaby,2025-05-01T17:30:47,1283

"Every week we have been receiving egregious updates after updates from the clown show that is this administration.  But I wanna stress again NONE of this is normal, this is a major fucking national security risk. They can downplay, propagandize and even lie but we can’t be jaded.  It feel like it’s just a matter of time before we see real life repercussions of these insane national data/security leaks.  What happens when eventually a security leak impacts the lives of our troops in bases overseas, undercover/espionage personnels worldwide, national homeland defenses- compromising us  domestically for an attack, etc.  The sheer incompetence I see everyday is causing me to feel like an impending doom is approaching the US….dunno wtf that event is, but at this rate and how compromised we are…feels like just a matter of time. ",HourPrinciple6,2025-05-01T18:24:25,78

"That doesn’t make it not true. The US no doubt could survive without Israel but if Israel is important enough to the US where Israel’s influence dictates what the US says and does, then they got the US by the balls. An analogy: two people in a relationship can break up and they’d be okay but if one of them is accustomed to a certain lifestyle that the other provides, they may be willing to make certain concessions for the other partner.",Colifama55,2025-05-01T18:23:44,6
"Look, as a person who believes that Israel has a right to exist.  It does have a degree of control on the US though..and now even more so.. much more under Donald Trump.  AIPAC. (American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) : They're one of if not the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With Citizens United and foreign money now pouring in, Israel can have an almost direct impact on elections. Two Pro-Palestinian incumbents Democratic US House Representatives lost in Democratic primaries because AIPAC made them literally the most expensive primary House races in history. This obviously sends a loud and clear message to others.  Bibi's been a giant pain in the ass for the Biden administration in 2024, and half the reason for him coming here in Summer 2024 was to help Trump get elected.",sereneandeternal,2025-05-01T18:57:49,4

">AIPAC. (American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) : They're one of if not the most powerful lobbying groups in America.

Could a foreign country be illegally back channeling money into an organization? Yes. Is that legal? No. AIPAC's money is from US citizens who support Israel and those donations require documentation.

It certainly appears to be. That was one of the complaints that was glossed over during the first signal leak. Those chats were all set to delete after 4 weeks.,Coherent_Tangent,2025-05-02T06:30:15,1
