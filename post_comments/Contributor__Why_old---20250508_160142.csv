"Excerpt:  Numbers first: If you look at the internals of, say, the most recent Marist poll, he does worst among members of the oldest age cohort: Only 37% of the greatest/silent generation ‚Äî people in their 80s and 90s ‚Äî approve of the president‚Äôs performance. Baby boomers ‚Äî those, like us, in our 60s and 70s ‚Äî aren‚Äôt far behind, with only 41% giving him the nod, compared to very nearly half of Gen X.  All of this goes against the common wisdom: You‚Äôre supposed to get more conservative as you age, and isn‚Äôt Trump supposed to be taking people our age back to our happy youth by making America great again? But we aren‚Äôt surprised: We‚Äôve spent the last three years organizing liberal and progressive Americans over the age of 60. They make it clear what‚Äôs going on.   My view on Protesting Trump: A Conservative Defense of Constitutional Governance  At 75, I've witnessed the arc of American governance long enough to recognize that resisting Donald Trump's agenda is not the mark of radicalism‚Äîit is, in fact, a deeply conservative act. His administration‚Äôs dismantling of constitutional safeguards, the erosion of checks and balances, and its flagrant disregard for democratic norms represent not a return to some imagined golden age, but a radical deviation from the foundational principles of American governance.  Trump's environmental policies further illustrate this radical departure. For many of us who have spent our lives working to preserve the American landscape‚Äîfrom our national parks and forests to the purity of our water and the safety of our food‚Äîhis aggressive rollback of environmental protections is nothing less than a direct assault on conservation itself. Stripping protections from sacred lands and diminishing regulatory oversight of polluters do not reflect conservative values; they reflect reckless consumption, with little regard for the inheritance we leave to future generations.  The popular myth that one grows more conservative with age is rooted in a misunderstanding of what ""conservative"" truly means. Conservatism, at its core, is about preservation‚Äîof institutions, of civil liberties, of the rule of law, and of the natural world. Trump's agenda is the opposite: it is a radical reimagining of executive power, an upheaval of constitutional constraints, and an outright dismissal of the norms that have bound our Republic for nearly two and a half centuries.  Resisting Trump is not a rebellion against conservatism; it is its most authentic expression. It is standing in defense of Madison's checks and balances, Hamilton's vision of federalism, and Jefferson's insistence on the separation of powers. It is also standing for Roosevelt's conservation ethic‚Äîthe idea that our natural resources are not ours to exhaust, but to steward. For those of us who have spent a lifetime living under the canopy of these principles, seeing them dismantled is not nostalgia for the past‚Äîit is alarm for the future.",D-R-AZ,2025-05-08T16:02:12,86

Old people are America's great financial burden. [There are about three people paying into Social Security for each one taking money out. Used to be about 5:1. It drops to about 2.5 to 1 around 2040.](https://www.pgpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ratio-of-workers-to-social-security-benificiaries-is-at-a-low-and-projected-to-decline-further-chart-1.jpg)  Almost all of the financial problems of the US come from that simple fact. Not conspiracies. Not immigration. Not that much waste and fraud as a percentage. **Just too many old people for workers to support.**,Animats,2025-05-08T16:29:00,-13

I feel like anyone should know that the Republican Party of even 20 years ago is dead. The current Republican Party is crazy and the people in it straight up say that the other (older) Republicans are rinos. It‚Äôs pretty twisted.

"Genuine question (since I am fortunate to not have any maga members in my immediate family), what would happen if you told them they had to choose between you and Trump, but could not have both, it's one or the other?

"Thank you.   Here‚Äôs the thing; from the first protests in my town I noticed a lot of my fellow olds. We know how to rally. To the people setting up protest sign ‚Äúlending libraries‚Äù, with a megaphone walking the parade route reading the best signs and getting people to chant them, showing kids how to harmlessly chalk slogans on the sidewalk and giving out chalk, most important those of you who brought packaged snacks and sunscreen to hand out ‚Ä¶ we see you!   We might not be on TikTok or setting up subreddits but we know damn well how to protest. Many of us see the Trump administration canceling hard fought rights and progress we fought for in our youth. I know I do.   I was looking forward to a quiet relaxing boring retirement; travel, some classes, putter in the garden, make some art.   But to the ramparts again.",takemusu,2025-05-08T20:09:05,11
"I mean, I think the issue here is we really already do. We give them healthcare and Social Security, age discrimination is legal under 40 so you have stuff like the guy who sued Lockheed because they fired him at 66 but were hiring young people, while countless jobs are all just ‚Äúyou need this much experience, no recent graduates‚Äù and you can‚Äôt get your foot in anywhere. My Grandmother, I love her dearly, her house she bought for cheap decades ago is worth over a million.

It could have been fixed if Social Security taxes were collected on incomes over ~$180k. Could have been fixed if very high earners and the wealthy paid even more on top of that.,GeneralZex,2025-05-08T16:59:45,15

There is a small part of me that wonders if reducing the number of older folks was part of the goal for the anti-mask and anti-vaccine campaigns on social media and in conservative circles during COVID19.,Independent-Stay-593,2025-05-08T18:43:26,4
I'm not American and neither is my 76 year old mother (but Trump is fucking things up on a global scale so at this point so we're all involved) and she recently told me she was watching him speak on the News and she had to fight the urge to put her fist through the TV!

"This is gonna sound like a deflection, but they never would,  For starters we run a business together and since they're in their 80s they need me too much.  Second, my mother will never acknowledged that I'm a liberal.  When I was 14 I came out as a Democrat, and yes in my family that is ""coming out"".  She laughed it off.  I'm 49 now and she still thinks I'm faking it; convinced I've never actually voted for a Dem in any election.

Somehow we found each other. Started riots and a movement. Without the internet or mobile ü§Øüò± Then the AIDS crisis happened and we watched generations of our friends die as Reagan ignored us.

"You protest to show numbers. You protest to raise awareness. But we also protest to be brave, to show ourselves and each other that we are not alone.   It‚Äôs easy to sit here with my dog on my lap doom scrolling. Or post and watch likes, upvotes and downvotes.   But if you can spare the time go to a demonstration, sign waving, town hall be it large or small to see and build your community. Others feel braver because they see you. You do this so you see and feel you are not alone.   We as humans need community. We‚Äôve needed community for almost as long as humans existed. Maybe longer. Is there an anthropologist in the house? What you are doing at demonstrations is a show of numbers to those who‚Äôd beat us down, and a show we‚Äôre not alone to yourself and others. If you can‚Äôt march and you see me out there do the happy horn beeps and wave as you drive past. That helps too.",takemusu,2025-05-09T18:49:56,1
