So either the white house has no idea what is going on or they are lying as damage control.,WhisperingHammer,2025-05-06T16:52:12,25
Can anyone change my mind that Trump told him not to let those flights go and wanted a patsy if it turned to shit?,dbuck1964,2025-05-06T16:46:16,9
"> US defence secretary Pete Hegseth cancelled military aid to Ukraine without a direct order from Donald Trump about a week after he was sworn in as president, according to a report.  > The pause led to the US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) stopping 11 flights from US bases in Delaware and Qatar which were loaded with artillery shells and other weaponry and had been bound for Ukraine, according to Reuters.  > Hours later, Ukrainian and Polish officials then asked Washington what was happening but top national security officials in the White House, Pentagon and US State Department were unable to provide answers, said the news agency.",Araminal,2025-05-06T16:39:34,6

"i see we already have a scape goat for any future problems..... nice to know you Pete. But its OK, you still have booze as company when Trump throws you under the bus.",wizgset27,2025-05-06T17:14:32,1
"Well Hegseth keeps losing jets so maybe they are realizing they can't send any more weapons to Ukraine?  Nah that's giving them too much credit.. they're incompetent, greedy and friendly with Russia. ",Basic_Ask8109,2025-05-06T20:22:09,1
There's never been a better time to invade the United States if a country ever considered it.,Marvin_Frommars,2025-05-06T17:43:28,1
"The truth is likely Trump ordered Hegseth to do it in person, and nobody else knew about it because Trump hates it when people ~~collect evidence~~ take notes.  So later when everyone's screaming WTF no-one else had a clue what the hell was going on.",jabrwock1,2025-05-06T17:04:43,11
Probably both tbh.,NoAnimator544,2025-05-07T01:14:23,2
Yeah I think Trump is the patsy. People like Miller are running the government. He's an 80 year old narcissist who is technically ultimately responsible for his administration but in practice is probably more an exercise in shuttling around a lightning rod for blame.,Huckleberry-V,2025-05-06T17:37:04,7
"I don't think he thinks that far ahead. Countless unpopular things he's done and triples down on them when questioned. I mean, he was impeached for withholding Ukraine aid.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T17:22:56,2
