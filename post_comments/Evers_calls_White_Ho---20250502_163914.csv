"People wanted a dictator; I used to live in the Florida Keys, and I warned everyone I knew before the 2024 election (and in 2015 too) that I lived next door to a dictator, and he wasn't a good neighbor. The bodies of those Fidel killed would wash up on our beaches, and I watched US Navy ships come back from the Gulfstream with massive artillery holes in them from being shot at by the Cuban Navy. I knew some missionaries who went to Cuba and said food for the Cuban people was scarce and everyone was constantly hungry (but there was plenty for tourists) - we're heading in that direction now with Trump's dumb-ass tariffs; I get the feeling shelves at the grocery stores are soon going to look like they did during Covid - which was a result of Trump's mismanagement then too, but I suspect this time things will be much, much worse. ",justtakeapill,2025-05-02T16:54:20,9
