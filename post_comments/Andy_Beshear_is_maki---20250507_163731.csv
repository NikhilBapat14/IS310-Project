"Kentuckian here, I like Andy as a governor but for POTUS we need a gunslinger. I hope people ask him point-blank if he thinks people in the Trump administration violated the Constitution and if so, how he plans to hold them accountable.

"Beshear is a good ""traditional"" kind of candidate, a very 1960s style kind of candidate. He checks off a lot of boxes and isn't overly offensive at any one thing to any demographic. But he needs to up his level of fame because built-in name recognition and celebrity seems to matter more these days.",bravetailor,2025-05-07T16:41:36,28

"Andy is the real deal. He is smart, empathetic, and a fantastic communicator. He is a good campaigner and tough but yet somehow can stay above the fray. I wish I could describe it better.  Even if he doesn’t get the presidential or vp nomination, he would be an AWESOME Attorney General of the US. He was Kentucky’s AG prior to being governor. I am a Kentuckian and have proudly voted for him the three times he has run and won.  In 2023 I was terrified he would lose re-election. But in October 2023 I was driving in a very very remote part of far Western Kentucky, one of the Mississippi River counties. And I saw his yard signs. *I can’t emphasize enough how remote and rural this was.* This area is redder than red. But there were his signs. I knew then he was going to win.",littlehound,2025-05-07T22:51:05,3

"As a Kentuckian, I hope Andy gets at least the Democratic VP nomination, if not the Presidential nomination.  He has won two statewide elections in now-deep-red (since 2004 or 2008, at least) Kentucky.  The first time, to be fair, he was running against one of the most-hated governors in living memory ([Matt Bevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bevin)); but he managed to win re-election in 2023 even despite the conservative opposition to his COVID policies.  **Edit:** And all that is ignoring his win for the (elected in KY) statewide office of Attorney General before he became Governor.  While he's by no means a progressive in the style of Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez, part of his last gubernatorial campaign was his unwavering support for trans folks.  The Republican supermajority of our General Assembly (legislature) managed to force through anti-trans bills over his veto, but he did the best he could do.  Also, if you do a web search for ""govern me, daddy"", he's right at the top.  So perhaps he has some populist appeal, which the national Democratic Party has been struggling with for some time.",No-Lawfulness-851,2025-05-07T16:57:58,5

"Andy's fantastic. He's firm and has a spine, but he's not loud or brash. He makes frequent public declarations of his faith, but it never feels overbearing or pushy. When he speaks, he makes it very clear that he wants what's right for his constituents. During covid, his daily updates showed so much heart and care and were a warm reassurance in a scary time. I think he's genuinely a normal, good, upstanding guy that you'd invite to your BBQ, and he knows how to win red voters. I really think that his white country christian boy charm can win the Republicans nationally like he did here in KY.

In another era, he would be too vanilla. Right now, he's still too vanilla. When the election truly starts to heat up, his momentum will be unstoppable. He's likely aware of this and unofficially starting the campaign early to generate the right kind of momentum. In a year, he'll be a household name. In 2 years, he'll be a first-name confidante.

Trump made big speeches about how he was going to make things better, blah blah blah, but he's one of the elite. He knows absolutely fuck all about farming or poverty or church picnics. Andy is a country boy who knows what the vast majority of America actually is and what people genuinely need. And I really hope he can demonstrate *that* effectively, because that's gonna be important to the Republicans who are feeling pretty let down currently (or will in the near future.)  And I can't imagine a universe in which he wouldn't agree wholeheartedly that violating the constitution is absolutely abhorrent and that Trump has made a mockery of it and our country.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-07T22:05:08,8

Beshear’s most likely successor at this juncture is Michael Adams, the Republican Secretary of State who actually has decent bipartisan support at the moment and who did a great job ensuring safe voter access during COVID (in my opinion). Based on his performance in that role, I would hope he avoids running for governor on dumb culture war bullshit, but I don’t have high expectations.
