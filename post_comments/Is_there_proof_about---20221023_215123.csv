"I think what works are GOTV efforts. Get out the vote. These can be small or large scale, but these efforts make the most difference.   Get your friends and family to vote. Help them get to the polls. Help them know where to go. Getting five people to the polls works more than making Radom phone calls, in my opinion.",cincyblog,2022-10-26T09:31:04,2
In Australia it's door knocking which is often seen as the most effective way to campaign. Having those 1 on 1 conversations make a lot of difference.  Door knocking is however very labour intensive so having a strong volunteer base is really important. Also having volunteers distribute party how to vote cards at prepoll and election day polling places.,Mitchell_54,2022-11-02T22:44:52,2
"Not really?  Electoral politics is *kind of* alchemy in the sense that we know certain things for sure, other things are just kinda...well....who knows?  For instance, take 2016. It's a perfect way to look at how everything can be done exactly right....and not work.  That should have been *the* year for Clinton. Democrats had a killer ground game, high enthusiasm, a well liked candidate (among the most likely to vote demographics, yes she was, hush) coming off of a wave of overall positivity towards Democrats. You had it being called pretty much the day she ran that this wasn't going to be an election it was just a foregone conclusion that she would win.  And yet....she didn't.  Another candidate came along and managed to tap into just the right strain of electoral energy in just the right way to squeak out a win. Call it whatever you want, that's what happened. You had an alignment of just the right person in just the right way at just the right time and all of a sudden you have what should have been a shoo-in spoiled.  There were a few people that were quicker to spot what was happening than others and some people who were less right and more accidentally not wrong but overall, if you'd sat down with serious people and talked to them about Clinton's chances of winning you'd have been laughed at if you had any opinions other than ""There's no way she can't win.""  Jeb is another great example, same year.  Guy should have been the perfect opposite choice. Something for Republicans tired of Obama to rally around, conservative but not *edgy,* and yet....he lost the nomination to someone else.  None of this is to try and cast Trump as some political genius or whatever, sometimes someone really does just accidentally be the right person in the right place at the right time. I'm just trying to highlight the fundamental problem of trying to read the tea leaves with regards to electoral politics. To paraphrase: ""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness, that is politics.""  ---  If you want to spend your time on what works, ask yourself what your ultimate goal is.  What do you want to see happen? What changes do you want to make in the short term and the long term?  Maybe you see a need that's being unfulfilled in your community and the powers that be aren't fulfilling it for....some reason.   Anyone telling you they can definitely measure the impact you have as a volunteer is full of it. We know that when campaigns do X, Y, and Z things they tend to win and without those things they tend to lose. But down to the specific individual level you're not really going to optimize your impact unless you're a very wealthy person and willing to spend a lot of money.",HeloRising,2022-10-26T08:02:53,1
"It's not as precise as we'd like. We do know that political activity WORKS. But it's not a formula, and it only really works on the margins. You can't door knock your way to victory if you're someone who genuinely doesn't have support in your district. Phone calls are essential, but they're hardly the ""one cool trick"" to guarantee an electoral victory.   Generally speaking, the more personal, the better, and the more you do cast your net, the better. But Forward is also running uphill to begin with, so if your measurement for success is ""will my party get more votes than anyone else"" then you'll almost certainly be disappointed.  My advice, speaking as someone who actually did field work for a campaign, is to door knocking as much as you can, then phone calls, then texts. More personal is better.",mormagils,2022-10-26T09:46:31,1
"There have been a lot of efforts to do so - but the issue with those studies is that you need a pretty long body of work to analyse, and those tactics often change faster than they can be confidently tracked long enough to measure strong causational impact.   I'll quote below some of those studies pulled together for different voter contact methods below - with context that this was in response to someone asking about letter-writing and me encouraging them to consider other ways of volunteers ***as well.*** And was written in a Democrat-focused subreddit, so obviously written in that perspective:  ""Sure - and I'll preface that this isn't meant to be disrespect to Vote Forward or letter writing campaigns. Less effective doesn't mean not effective. And for some people, that's the only type of volunteering they'll be comfortable with or able to do - and obviously doing something always helps the larger push.      The root of the question, effective is a vague word so a couple ways of looking at it.      A quick zoom out that from a campaign strategy point of view, you have a basic matrix that your voter base falls along - with the axis of support on one side and the on turnout for the other. i.e: (this is meant to be a spectrum but you can only format so much in a comment so.      Unlikely to Vote	Maybe Votes	Always Votes   Supporter	A1	A2	A3   Undecided	B1	B2	B3   Opposed	C1	C2	C3  What makes for an effective voter contact method depends on who you want to reach, but boils down to:      \- how effective they are at converting      \- how many you can reach (which is a bit tied to cost-efficiency too)      So a quick run through some of these voter contact options:      Canvassing or door-knocking is traditionally considered the most effective and studies tend to back that up. Here's one that reviewed in context of MoveOn's efforts in this case, that voter contact through canvassing increased turnout by 9%. This usually increases even with more experienced and volunteer based programmes.      But not only is it effective in turnout but it's critically helpful for a few other reasons. Data is pretty key. Most campaigns start with a voter file but those tend to be outdated and people change views. Canvassing is a 'two-way' exchange. So we get information like, for example, if it's an Obama to Trump voter or even better if they were someone who was in B2 above, but you talked to them and now they're a supporter (A2) - you'll want to be sure they remember to vote when the time comes. Or if it's just wrong (i.e. that person doesn't live here anymore, etc). That helps target further voter contact (for Get Out the Vote efforts, you want to target A1 and A2 above especially. Or if it's, for example, a registered Democrat that yelled you off their porch because Democrats are all Communists, there's no point in continuing with limited resources to get to that person - so you can now move them from A to C).      It's also open for persuasion. So you have a wider opportunity to move poeple from that undecided row to the supporter row and have a conversation. We'll get back to that later.      While very effective on conversion, it does however take more horsepower. An average 'packet' for canvassing is 30 addresses in suburban areas. 50-60 in urban areas. That usually will take the average canvasser a couple hours. So this is best when you have a lot of volunteers and time.      Phone banking (especially volunteer phone banks) increases turnout by around 3.8% depending on the study.      The benefit here is that much like canvassing, you can target a broader range of voters to both persuade and promote turnout. And you can also collect additional targeting data to make your continued efforts more efficient.      The other benefit is that it's relatively cheap and even moreso, it's time and labour-efficient. Manually dialling, you can get through a hundred or so dials in an hour pretty easily. If you have an auto-dialler, that gets even faster. (The study also gets to the dynamics of more personal, high quality calls are likely to increase the impact of phone banking even further).      There's also a bit of a generational shift here. It's a particularly good option to reach older voters - younger voters tend to have already adopted a very 'ad-blinders' approach to phone calls too.",PhiloPhocion,2022-10-30T10:48:58,1
"Part two:      Another increasingly common one is text-banking. This isn't the automated ones from a 030405 type number. But one that has to be sent, even if through a software portal, manually and individually - but will also come from a real phone number. Still a bit emergent but a study after the Obama campaign saw increases invoter turnout around 3% from text reminders to vote.      Huge benefit is obviously, you can send out a lot of these very quickly and is an easy option for volunteers who don't feel comfortable or safe knocking on doors or phone banking.      Downside is that it's expected people will increasingly ignore these as we get used to ads everywhere too. So that 'ad-blinders' approach is coming as these types of texts saturate beyond what people are willing to accept and read. In short, it's being increasingly used and thus, increasingly getting mentally filtered out as spam.      Other downside is that their primary use is one directional. You get no information about whether that voter is likely to support your candidate or cause, how likely they are to vote, how we can more effectively reach them, even if that's still their number. Even though some of those platforms can allow you to chat back and forth - people rarely ever will because it feels like a broadcast ping or a notification rather than a person (which unfortunately also means text bankers often have to deal with the nastiest replies because they don't think there's a real person behind the keyboard).      Letter writing - it is a little less studied. Direct mail traditionally has a much lower rate of return though - usually anywhere from 1% to less. Obviously, this isn't the number that should be applied to personal campaigns like VOTEFWD's because that's the whole theory there is that personal letters garner more attention than traditional direct mail.      I don't want to come off as guns blazing opposed but 1) the stats VOTEFWD shares doesn't give us a ton of detail and are limited to a few cases (which I think is not unfair to presume are their best case studies). These show a max of 1.4 - 4.2 point increases - very impressive but again I'd presume their best cases. Also as a minor gripe, the best score there is for ballot requests not voting - still a good success rate but isn't quite the same as actual voter turnout, which is right next to it at a much reduced 2.8.      But even taking them as they are, they are either lower or in line with the other options but do not offer the opportunity for actual exchange. So we, for example, have no guarantee that those we convinced to vote are supporters or not (not inherently the worse thing, we support voter access for everyone, but also not what we ideally want to spend our time doing to bring out opposition voters) nor do we have the ability to persuade anyone. So back to the box above, unlike the other methods, the only real target we want to hit with these is A1 and A2. We get no data to reach them better nor do we really have a chance to see how they stand or persuade them much further. It's a broadcast message rather than a conversation if that makes sense.      The cost-efficiency is a bit of an offset. While the methods above are usually supported by the campaign (phone banking softward, turf cutting for canvassing, etc), these letter campaigns 'offload' that expense onto the volunteers. Not to say that's malignant but it's a bit of a disingenuous way to describe it as cost-effective. The cost is just born by volunteers rather than Vote Forward or the campaign. I'm sure volunteers are happy to and it doesn't mean it's exclusive to this (canvassers pay gas or public transit fares to canvass too for example) but again, just a bit disingenous to call cost-effective.      The other efficiency question is the time per contact. How long does each handwritten (and hopefully) personal letter take versus, for example, phone banking that has a conversion rate near the best case that Vote Forward has identified but rather than 5 minutes or so per letter, you can get through hundreds of contacts in a few hours.      Again, if that's all the volunteer is comfortable or able to do - it's still great. Even 0.5% increases can swing whole states. But it's not the most efficient outlet for voter contact and often can create comfort barriers to towards more proven effective forms of voter contact, both in time commitments and willingness to try them.",PhiloPhocion,2022-10-30T10:49:16,1
