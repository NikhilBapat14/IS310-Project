“But could a president who admires dictators choose a better metaphor for his second administration than turning a tourist hot spot into a bleak gulag that revives the hard-knocks justice of a less enlightened age?”,Positive_Owl_2024,2025-05-05T23:56:42,9
"Blah blah blah. Nonsense article.   Reopening Alcatraz is the perfect metaphor for Turnip’s second term because saying it is vapid, without merit, not thought through, not researched at all, and his sycophants will praise it endlessly.   BTW, the gulag in a tourist hot spot is already there. It’s a few coves over and called San Quentin.",kokopelleee,2025-05-06T00:08:01,8

Trumps little brain thought: I'm going to rebuild Alcatraz...  He is going to sink millions into a sinking island...instead of using the already built SuperMax prisons...He was going to use Guantanamoxtge that's not working out so I well. So he watched a movie with Jon Voight and this is what they came up with.,SAJ-13,2025-05-06T00:09:21,7

"> It is possible that Mr. Trump had “Escape From Alcatraz” on his mind when he declared on social media on Sunday that he had directed federal agencies to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz to serve as “a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”  > When he was asked on Monday how he came up with the idea, he said that he should have been a “moviemaker,” and he praised the island’s top-notch security.  > “Nobody ever escaped,” he said, not quite accurately. “One person almost got there, but they — as you know the story — they found his clothing rather badly ripped up. It was a lot of shark bites, a lot of problems.”  > In “Escape From Alcatraz,” shreds of the material of a raincoat are found floating in the bay.  The idiot watched a movie and let it inform his policy decisions... What a fucking clown.  But let's also not pretend like he isn't trying to follow in Bukele's footsteps here. Even though this type of project would be extremely costly, impractical, inhumane, and would amount to a massive logistical nightmare, this is just another attempt from Trump to appeal to his seething and mindless followers with more ""law and order,"" ""tough on crime"" dog whistling.  Alcatraz was abandoned for a reason. It's literally a ruin at this point. They've actually had to reinforce areas of the prison to prevent concrete from falling on the heads of tourists.  Its buildings are missing roofs and entire walls, there's no sewage system or running water, and the government pronounced it a crumbling ""relic"" over 60 years ago when they closed it down.  Alcatraz was also deemed insolvent, costly and ""insufficient"" to house prisoners. Rebuilding and maintaining it is just impractical from a mere economic perspective.  But now Trump wants to restore this relic because he watched a movie recently and he's more interested in rallying his base into a frenzy over more promises of ""crime and punishment"" and imprisoning ""undesirables.""  In all likelihood, Trump won't be able to follow through on yet another absurd proposal, but that hasn't stopped his supporters from demanding that Trump's political opponents be the first to grace its cells.  I bet Trump's also thinking that he can use Alcatraz as a Bukele-like ""terrorist containment center"" where he can incarcerate so-called migrant ""gang members"" and ""criminals,"" as well as foreign students, protestors, journalists and political dissidents with little to no due process. And despite its capacity being small in comparison to the overall prison population.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-06T01:22:02,3
The man freeing pedophiles and cop killers wants a prison,MiniBanjo,2025-05-06T03:40:38,3
I think it would be a perfect place to exile Trump and his felonious cohorts after he's out of office. It would give tourists something to look at instead of empty cells. They'd have to be careful though — primates have been known to throw their shit when ridiculed and agitated.,invalidpassword,2025-05-06T00:29:09,2
It’s also a perfect reminder not to get distracted but the nonsense he says publicly while he’s doing all kinds of horrible stuff. Now the media is talking about this dumb idea not covering the Trump economic collapse,yngwiegiles,2025-05-06T05:52:01,2
