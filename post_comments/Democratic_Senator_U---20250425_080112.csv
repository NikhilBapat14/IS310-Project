"While possibly true, Slotkin with her “I will lay my body down at the border before I let Chinese EVs underprice American corporations” might be one of the most tone-deaf here.   While I agree, I hope Slotkin remains thoroughly Beta Energy in the party.",dkran,2025-04-25T08:07:32,40
"> According to Politico, Slotkin is preparing to make speeches regarding a ""war plan"" to ""contain and defeat Donald Trump.""  Oh I can’t wait to see how Fox disingenuously spins that one.",ScotTheDuck,2025-04-25T08:05:50,20

"Slotkin is so tiresome. She's convinced she's the smartest person in the universe when she's really just a mix of all the other toxic centrists that came before, except WITH CURSE WORDS.   She received fewer votes in Michigan than Kamala did. She's no savior.",OnlyMamaKnows,2025-04-25T08:21:07,14
"A corporate democrat has been tasked with sucking the energy from Bernie and aoc. She will push for a return to the status quo, while being arm in arm with “moderates” like bush and Cheney talking about a return to the centre. And the dems will continue to lose and they will continue to blame voters for being duped. The dems still haven’t come to terms with their last ass kicking. They are truly the most useless group of grifters ever assembled.",Unusual_Ant_5309,2025-04-25T08:25:25,10
"It's always some college educated upper-class white person who never worked a manual job in their life telling people to ""just have alpha energy"".   It is extremely tone deaf.    This woman is paid $134k/yr to defend the public sector and she thinks it's someone else's job to do, because it's ""too hard"".",Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-04-25T08:18:02,7

"Can she just fucking go away. She's not helping anything.   Between her lame ass response to Trump's Joint Session of Congress speech (I've literally seen airline safety videos that have more fire in them than Slotkin), to her saying she is angry at AOC and Bernie for advocating for folks to have a more ""progressive"" fight against Trump, and then now this.   Her comeback to all of this is always that she represents Michigan, and she needs to balance with the state's conservative leanings in some areas. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I find that comment comical seeing as Harris got more votes than her in Michigan.   Centrist Democrats like her are almost as delusional as a MAGA IMO.",walkallover1991,2025-04-25T08:53:31,4

But...Alpha energy?      seriously, lets not make this into a dick measuring contest between Democrats and trump's republican clown circus, can we do that?      how about instead showing courage and demonstrating what having a spine is like in face of trumps clear anti-Americanism, anti-Constitutionalism, and his ever expanding debriding of the Bill of Rights!",dispelhope,2025-04-25T12:38:55,1

"She still represents Michigan, and by extension, a huge chunk of UAW members.   Democrats from the industrial Midwest have always been at odds with the rest of the party (and indeed pre-Trump Republicans) on the issue of trade.  I’m not saying she’s right *per se*, but there are constituency concerns there that have existed as long as the Democratic Party has existed in the industrial states as the party of organized labor.",ScotTheDuck,2025-04-25T08:12:31,10
The GOP constantly takes language from the left and perverts it - why should the democrats not try to do the same thing?  Alpha energy has its own cultural meaning beyond the original (and wrong) 'scientific' context.,Metro42014,2025-04-25T10:18:14,3
"Yes.  Its just taking outdating scientific frames that bled over into culture because of how useful they were to existing social and economic hierarchies and repurposing them to valorize male aggression.   You can tell people to be assertive, confident, fight back fearlessly, etc., all the things without adopting false rightwing framing or mythological thinking.

"They already do hire marketers as campaign consultants. It has nothing to do with messaging and everything to do with the lack of actual good policies that they consistently fight hard for. The democratic party is the party of ""just a little to the left"" of the republican party at this point because it has been almost completely captured by politicians who are beholden to the same monied interests that support the republican party. The party is effectively a steam valve for the heat capitalism creates, and the valve keeps getting smaller and smaller over time.",Oldschoolhype2,2025-04-25T08:56:10,2

Not really true. Neoliberals from all corners of America have always been pro outsourcing of labor in favor of profits for their top 1% donors. It has nothing to do with regional differences. ,Oldschoolhype2,2025-04-25T08:47:35,-3
"God damn this is why the left can't ever make any actual in-roads with the general public. Word-policing is a bigger priority than actually doing anything to win anybody over. This is a big part of the general public being off-put by the progressives.  Half the posts here actually agree with the message, but it's more important to whine about the wording of it or who's saying it.",throwawayainteasy,2025-04-25T09:37:21,6
"Good point to bring up, definitely agree she is interchangeable with almost any democrat",Loud-Ad-2280,2025-04-25T08:34:55,2
"Exactly! Democrats think it's a messaging issue and not a marked shift to a pro-wall street platform that has gutted the wealth of the bottom 50% of the nation.  The New Deal coalition dissolved after LBJ signed the civil rights movement so Democrats shifted right on economic issues while peppering in dog whistle tough on crime/welfare reform. Then every fucking election since Clinton have nominated a centrist (or in Obama's case a progressive speaker with neolib ideology) that prioritizes college educated suburbanites.  Then dems look around wondering why the working class is slowly abandoning them. The right wing messaging on social issues only work because Democrats don't have an economic platform that supercedes that.  A lot of socially conservative Democrats stayed with the party through the 70s because the pocketbook supercedes biases. Once the economic message of Democrats was indistinguishable from the conservatives, of course the old working class said ""well I guess I'll vote for the racist.""  People seem to forget fucking Indiana went for Obama in 08 but Romney in 12. Why is that? Because Obama's message came across as the type to lift the working class up. After bailing out Wall Street, those rural white voters in Indiana who voted for Obama said ""fuck that.""",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-25T09:17:40,2

"They don't hire *good* ones. Or the *right* ones. Look at all of the posts just in this sub about the party ignoring the working class, or having the wrong energy. The party has been doing the equivalent of hiring the chief marketers for the Amish to spread the word about Spring Break.  They did a decent job with Hillary and would have won that one if not for her utter incompitence, ego and greed.  The best thing the Ds have going for them is the utter stupidity and lack of any semblance of wisdom on the part of the Rs. I swear the Rs are making so many errors it is plausible that they are throwing races: they lost both of those senate seats in Georgia which should have been easy wins and any rookie campaign manager could have won those, but.... we've already established that they're dum.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T09:11:00,1

"Except he said democrats, which I took to mean elected democratic officials. Democratic voters as a whole nationwide have always been pro american worker and anti-outsourcing of labor for profits. The disagreement currently is that some workers think tariffs will put them in a better position to increase wages and jobs, while others say the ship already sailed and all this will do is crash the global economy and trade system that was built over decades by the same types of people trying to dismantle it now. People who are only doing this to try to hamstring China, not to help American workers. ",Oldschoolhype2,2025-04-25T15:42:43,1
"Not at all. If it was you would have seen a lot more pro union and pro domestic manufacturing legislation being written/cosponsored by democrats from Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin over the past 30 years. When manufacturing started to be outsourced, these states were some of the hardest hit but their state governments and elected federal politicians did little to try to prevent the hollowing out of the rust belt.
