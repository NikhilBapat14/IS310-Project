"I'm so tired of comments like this. Future ""history"" doesn't matter to present day people suffering and dying. Like am I supposed to be like ""I can get sent to a slave labor camp in a foreign country for being brown but THANK GOD history will view my death as wrongful""? Like I get the sentiment. But it's also meaningless to the LGBT+, Hispanic, and other minorities that will die. It's meaningless if history is rewritten. We can't rely on the future to deal with this. History viewed the Nazi death camps as wrong, but guess where we are now: Nazis all over the fucking world gaining traction again. We need a complete upheaval of modern civilization and it's just not going to happen. We're in this shitty timeline and Americans have been engineered to be complacent and not rise up, so nothing is really going to change.",DoctorCybil,2025-04-28T12:33:35,2
