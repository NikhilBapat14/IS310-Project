Not completely. Trump did this to farmers during his first term. Soy agriculture has never returned to what it used to be due to how our relationship changed with China. During his first term everyone had to subsidize the ag industry because of trump. This time around he has implemented a sales tax through tariffs to subsidize whatever permanent damage he does this time around.,postdiluvium,2025-05-10T18:55:37,1
"Probably yes, but it will become something of an inverse of what we had before. Whereas government got to give lower wages for a higher stability, now they'll need to pay out the nose. Which works as long as Americans can keep printing dollars. Once the dollar goes under, then things will be much harder in regards to hiring experts.",RocketRelm,2025-05-10T18:56:26,1
"I don't see the level of competence or dedication coming back to our govt anytime soon unless we actually manage to fully purge MAGA, and their idiot cohorts, and pass a whole new set of anti corruption laws that will stop any sort of government capture like that form happening again.   We would need some level of conscious rebuilding of our government. A new Govt jobs program, all sorts of things like we got with the new deal.   We'd also need a leader who could carry that and save maybe AOC I don't think any of the other corporatist Dems have the will to do anything like that.",Wave_File,2025-05-10T18:56:46,1
I think what will happen is we will pay even more for contractors and consultants because what idiot would want to work for lower pay and no job stability?,shapptastic,2025-05-10T19:10:40,1
"Yes, but not the same jobs.  Just as problems will evolve, so will government's needs.  Assuming the Rs lose in 4 years, the Ds will slowly change the direction of government and hire staff to accomplish the changes.  Clearly, we are still going to need air traffic controllers and many other types of people.  But some will never come back.",scotus1959,2025-05-10T19:21:33,1

America is still recovering from Trumps first term…Biden’s progress is already wiped out. We are in free fall now.,TheGOPisTheDeepState,2025-05-10T19:39:19,1
That's tough to answer. In the short run? It's a possibility. In a long run? It would take methodical actions to do so.,Dyna_bit,2025-05-10T19:42:13,1
"Yes, there is plenty of manual labor that needs to be done to put this country back together. This isn’t all mindless work, people need to apply their critical thinking and also.. accomplish more then just pushing papers back and forth .",SylvanDsX,2025-05-10T19:44:00,1
"Would we want to? I’m sure it will be shown that many positions were necessary, and we will have to create those positions again. That won’t be difficult. But we will also find that many positions weren’t actually necessary, so why would we want to recreate those?",DBDude,2025-05-10T19:01:26,1
This is repeating. House Republicans are looking to add $60billion to this year’s farm bill to cover the shortfalls caused by Trump’s trade war.   https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/08/congress/house-republicans-farm-programs-snap-megabill-00335377,rangkilrog,2025-05-10T19:10:51,1
"Yes most of Americans don't realize that government workers settle for lower wages. They do so for stability but also because they feel good about what they're doing as opposed to working for the private sector. That shouldn't be underestimated. I've worked in the private sector and I worked for the US Forest service decades ago. The US Forest service paid next to nothing but I felt good about what I was doing. I grew up in the DC area. My parents were not federal workers but I knew many. They were some of the best people and no they were not liberal for the most part they were Democrat more often than Republican but mostly they were pretty centrist and apolitical. There's a very small percentage of jobs in the federal government that have anything to do with politics. These were not greedy employees they would not have gone into government work if they were. There is no position in government that you're paid even remotely what your same skill set would make in the private sector. I guess maybe at the lowest end like for a janitor, a government janitor is going to make more money than a private sector janitor for the most part but that's only because the federal government gives an actual living wage to their employees more often.",Fragrant_Witness_713,2025-05-10T19:06:12,1
"> we will also find that many positions weren’t actually necessary  Two questions:  1. How many is ""many""?  2. How do you know this will be a significant portion of the positions cut?",BroseppeVerdi,2025-05-10T19:10:46,1
"You are always going to have a certain amount of jobs that are redundancies or inefficiencies. I worked in the private sector for 90% of my life. I have found that once you get over a very small organization they are all inefficient and all have redundancies and things you could cut. This is not a trait of government. This is a trait of organizations. But part of the reason that you have that is simply because you cannot staff for the bare minimum situations. This is because things will fall through the cracks and you will have no one to handle situations you can't just hire somebody at the last second and train them if suddenly you realize you need them. The larger an organization gets be it private or public sector, The more you're going to have to build in inefficiencies to cover for the unexpected. For example you have a small project and it's small enough that you know that you only need two people to do it. Compare that to a large project where you simply are not going to know exactly what you need because there are too many different variables. You're going to have to staff completely differently in those situations You're going to have to leave a margin of error to handle large projects and different situations. It's the very nature of big companies and government. There are going to be real problems resulting from this. Services are going to fail. Things that should have been done will not be done. Further, there are areas such as the consumer finance protection bureau and the IRS where the cuts are actually going to cost the government more money, by billions. Yes there should always be continuous monitoring for efficiency and that's what always goes on could it be better sometimes sure, but we all know the biggest area is in defense and that hasn't even been touched. It's actually been increased, yet one's invading us ever. It's the biggest con the biggest scam the biggest area of fraud and abuse and it's not been touched.  why? Because this has never been about money it's always been about policies. They don't want regulation. They don't want consumer protection. They don't want the rich to get audited. They don't want scientists looking at climate change. They don't want anybody studying the effects of race and poverty on the quality of education. In the meantime we just spent money to put people on a plane from South Africa. In the meantime between him going to wrestling matches, his golf course, and having a parade for his fucking birthday, That's hundreds of millions of dollars already. It's only 3 months in and he's spent well over 100 million on bullshit.",Fragrant_Witness_713,2025-05-10T19:13:31,1
"Doge fired everyone without any analysis of the work they did or consideration for their abilities or competency for the role.  They blanket fired any ""probationary employees.""  Most people assume that meant most of those fired were new hires with little to no experience.  However, probationary workers ALSO included any employees who had been promoted in the last 6 months, as well as anyone who had relocated to bring their expertise to a new area.  The result is that they ended up firing a lot of people in management and leadership positions as well as the new hires.  All those people were hired for a purpose. I think we'll find the overwhelming majority were needed to perform the work that needed to be done.  A lot of programs were canceled at the same time, so I guess those positions won't be needed any longer unless the programs are reinstated.   You say we can just rehire for those positions, but I don't think it's that simple.   These actions are going to have lasting effects well beyond the Trump presidency.  Why would anyone with talent, experience, or options take a government job when at any time someone can come in and eliminate their job and destroy their career?  Even the union positions weren't safe.  The only people who will be willing to take federal jobs anytime soon are those who can't find anything else, meaning we won't be getting the best and the brightest.  We've lost a lot of talented people and probably won't be able to replace them with the same caliber of workers.",Roadside_Prophet,2025-05-10T19:24:39,1

"Scientists are fleeing America & a lot of regular people might wonder what that has to do with government employees, but the gov does so much scientific work. I mean I guess we can shutdown NASA, NIST, NRC, etc. We can stop regulating electricity, the environment, etc.   These people aren't coming back. Personally I can't imagine a scenario where I or any of my friends return to America let alone a job in government. Pass.",twbird18,2025-05-10T19:41:48,1
