"He's trying to make his recession seem trivial, as if it is only going to affect dolls and girly things.  How many video games should kids have?  How much sports gear?  Will their parents be able to afford a car?",Penjat,2025-05-10T09:42:51,36
"Honestly, the item in question is irrelevant. The fact that the President of a capitalist society is making light of reduced consumption of goods in peacetime is kind of insane. Capitalism thrives on growth and this guy's okay with compressing the economy.   The dominoes are going to tumble hard.",E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-10T10:39:05,1
"Here’s the real thing about this statement. Trump is such an elitist, untenthered shithead that he thinks people are buying their kids 30 dolls. What he is really saying here is kids should get 0 dolls instead of 1.",orcinyadders,2025-05-10T10:50:18,1
“I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.”  \-Donald Trump 2025,kweathergirl,2025-05-10T09:29:54,9

My theory is that he saw the “protect the dolls” tee shirts and movement and thinks it’s literally about Barbie dolls. His brain is cooked! I think it’s also why he’s going after Mattel,spicybabyspice,2025-05-10T11:04:24,1

"Some clever person needs to make Barbie versions of Ivan’s, Ivan’s, Marla, Tiffany, MTG, Nome, Bondi, both of his female press secretaries, Boebert, the blonde Fox bimbos (does that put it over 39 yet?), Susan, Collins, etc and post them under  “Happy Holidays” banner?",RitaPoole56,2025-05-10T09:58:52,3

It’s so shit to frame it as “2 dolls instead of 30” and not the reality of “0 dolls instead of 1” for low income families.  This really is the darkest timeline.,cptblumpkins,2025-05-10T14:14:56,1
And 100% tariffs on the “country” of Mattel… 🤦🏻‍♀️,Tart-Pomgranate5743,2025-05-10T14:40:48,1
This may seem like a tone deaf comment but I bet there was a ton of research by ultra right think tanks behind it. Only dumbass MAGAts are stupid enough to go into debt to get their princesses a ton of American Girl dolls they can’t afford.,AAA_4481,2025-05-10T09:46:47,1
There’s literally a term for this and I can’t think of it. But it refers to trivializing something major by making it seem like “stupid women’s troubles.”,1nconsp1cuous,2025-05-10T11:03:43,1
The item is relevant because it implies that girls are spoiled.  But the rest of your point stands.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-10T12:56:56,1

"Because he is trivializing effects of tariffs and marginalizing girls at the same time.  He is suggesting that purchasing and shopping is a feminine overindulgence that threatens men's hard-earned earnings.  This is not simply a crazy old man comment.  It is a precisely calculated message targeting a specific audience.  He is still a crazy old man, but someone gave him this talking point for this reason.",fastautomation,2025-05-10T10:22:39,1
"Because he's an idiot. Retailers told him shelves would be empty and that instead of 30 dolls there would only be 2 and they'll cost more because of his tariffs.  His rotten brain turned it into ""Kids only get 2 dolls instead of 30.""  When the reality is that 28 kids will get ZERO and the two that get them have rich parents.",Boring_Investment597,2025-05-10T10:33:12,1
"He ( or his handlers since he probably doesn't understand what is going on around him) is downplaying the brunt of the tariffs.  It will affect ""ew gross, girly"" things, so of course the big strong American maga manly men will be ok.",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-10T10:58:15,1
"This alone should be enough to remove all tariffs. Trump can only make them because of his claim that it’s for national security. Matell doesn’t pose a threat to national security and he only doubled down on this because of that statement he made about Matell being a country, when our President feels dumb he acts out to show everyone he isn’t really dumb it was all intentional",herdingsquirrels,2025-05-10T13:29:09,1
