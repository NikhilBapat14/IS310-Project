Say goodby to public schools as you know them in Texas. Your property taxes (higher than even California) will be going to private institutions.,williamgman,2025-04-24T16:43:24,9

"As a former educator from the state of Texas, still hold an active license, this will not resolve the issues within the Texas Education system.  Many issues stem from the value many Texan families place upon education and the attitude that their children/students then bring into the schools. Furthermore, many teachers are unwilling to improve their practice and continually learn/develop as they gain experience. When you couple all of this with students that actively do not care about being at school you can see why parents want to withdraw their kids. However, most private schools I had seen underpaid their staff/faculty which typically lead to lower quality Education which was only offset because the kids who went there cared.  Finally, ""Here is a worksheet"" simply doesn't cut it anymore. Couple that with the anti-science, history revisionist, and apparently the inability to understand economics. I have little to no hope for the overall Education system there which is painful to say. I'm sure there will be an easy nationally recognized exam that people will all take in order to get that extra money in their pockets.",ryudo6850,2025-04-24T17:17:19,1
Will anything be directed to the schools or teachers so we can finally stop spending our own money to buy classroom supplies?,cheap_as_chips,2025-04-24T17:33:24,1
I continue to be amused at just how mad conservatives remain at integration. ,HappyFunNorm,2025-04-24T17:55:11,1
31 billion some surplus last year and they managed to pass a way to launder it.  I will be so glad to leave this shithole of a state. ,piratehalloween2020,2025-04-24T17:33:24,5
