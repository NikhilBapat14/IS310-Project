Itâ€™s been interesting watching Newsom kill all Presidential hopes,SouthernEagleGATA,2025-05-06T07:02:55,47
Newsom is doubling down on the ever-losing strategy of trying to win over Republican voters. Fuck that guy. He lost me at 'work with Trump'.,cugeltheclever2,2025-05-06T07:07:14,44

"Work with the guy in support of your state, but don't use his partisan jargon like a sycophant. Is Newsom Fettermaning?",theombudsmen,2025-05-06T08:09:15,3
"I think Newsom realized he never had a shot at winning the presidency no matter what so now he's angling to be seen as the ""conservative Democrat"" on all the talk shows and stuff who gets hired to present neo-liberal talking points.  Even before all this he really never had a shot at winning nationally. No one in fly-over country was going to vote for a slick LA product and the East Coast hates anyone from the West Coast. Add to that his own lack of support by his own party and the writing has long been on the wall.",DisMFer,2025-05-06T08:58:29,3
"Thereâ€™s really no need to use Trumpâ€™s catchphrase, but trying to manipulate him to lessen the impact of this tariff on Hollywood is fine.Â ",StormOk7544,2025-05-06T07:05:51,2
That's it. Make movies more expensive so that pirating carries on full steam. Well done dickheads.,theflower10,2025-05-06T07:35:50,2
The film companies have moved away from the US to avoid Unions and my guess or hope is that Newsom wants to bring the business back to CA for their benefit. Other states have tax incentives and should be also trying to get the Presidents attention. Canada gets a lot of business from the industry that used to fuel Hollywood economy. The money is gone and it is not dumb to think he wants it. The Democrat Governors are going to have to find ways to get him to play ball or they will suffer the most from this administration. When he makes moves that may benefit them they need to react even if they do not care for his policies.,Morepastor,2025-05-06T09:58:14,2

Smell like Trump tries to indirectly tell the world that Newsom doing nothing to protect his own turf. So Newsom responded with idea using Fedâ€™s money.,Dry-Way-5688,2025-05-06T09:24:10,1

"there is a lot of ""stealth MAGA"" money here in the bay area tech sector and other parts of CA, and our rural areas have been shifting red, so i imagine that's what he's chasing.  you're still right of course. even the MAGAts will often respect a democrat with real principles over a false-centrist neoliberal car salesman.",wavygrave,2025-05-06T08:04:57,4
He was the one - before Biden announced he was dropping out and basically threw his support behind Kamala - that some Democrats were pining for to replace Biden.  I am really worried that he's going to be the one the party tries to shove down our throats in 2028.,karmavorous,2025-05-06T07:29:31,10

Iâ€™m under the impression that Newsom is tanking his campaign so the progressive wing of the party can get one of their candidates in. New Democrats are Clinton/Obamaâ€™s centrist wing of the partyÂ ,AcadiaFlyer,2025-05-06T07:50:33,4
