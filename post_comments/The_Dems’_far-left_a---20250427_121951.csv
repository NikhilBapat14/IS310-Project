"It sounds like a bad joke, but it’s really happening. And it’s a movement that goes beyond the socialist fever dreams of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria ­Ocasio-Cortez.  Although some of the push is a reaction to Donald Trump’s election in November and his embrace of America First policies, the fury reflects more than just Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Don’t cave to these people, resist them!  Or they could ask the 12 million illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in why they risked life and limb to get here if America is such a terrible, rotten place to live and work.  One thing the radicals can’t deny is that the Dem party that voters soundly rejected last November has its lowest national approval rating ever at under 30%.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-27T12:32:01,1
