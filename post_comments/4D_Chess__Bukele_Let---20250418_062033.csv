What narrative was discredited? I’m not understanding,throway57818,2025-04-18T09:50:21,113
Those are some odd tattoos on his hand. Dems said the only evidence of gang affiliation was hearsay. Did they... lie?!,ControlledChimera,2025-04-18T07:54:50,82
Boy did this story disappear real fast on the front page  Hope he reimburses taxpayers for the wasted trip. This could’ve been done over FaceTime or something.,atcmaybe,2025-04-18T07:39:11,67
"The democrats narrative is always skewed but they are hoping you don’t notice. They all have severe TDS, it is not healthy.   Kilmar Garcia is just fine and alive and should enjoy his stay in El Salvador. Holland’s visit was to give Holland publicity, he has no interest in Garcia except for the press it gives Holland. That’s it!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T06:26:22,89
"Speaking of damning pics, a photo of Garcia's knuckle tattoos showed up. Weird ""coincidences"" keep turning up around this guy who an informant immediately recognized.  Marijuana plant = M  Smiley = S   Cross = 1  Skull = 3",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T08:29:25,16

"Suddenly, Van Hollen becomes immensely unpopular among Dem circles and loses his DNC support. No doubts.   He’s become a liability against the narrative now.",ITrCool,2025-04-18T08:05:21,10

They were CERTAIN he was dead if not maimed beyond the ability to hold a normal meet and greet like this. Their false narrative is extermination camps.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T10:27:58,61
That he was dead and being tortured.,Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-18T17:48:39,5

Literally has MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles.,Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-19T04:46:50,2
How many Americans did he visit that were held hostage in Isreal?,whicky1978,2025-04-18T12:57:42,27
It wouldn't have been as dramatic if he did that,smkn3kgt,2025-04-18T10:59:55,2
\>Holland’s visit was to give Holland publicity  Crying at the border fence all over again - people don't turn any political wheels by doing this but they make themselves more famous which increases the size of the kickbacks they get.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T14:59:15,9
Holland hasn’t spoken to the citizen mother who was mirdered by an illegal in his own state. It’s probably to distract from that and give himself some “good” publicity to liberals. They fell for it ofc half of Reddit is drooling on themselves screaming THIS IS WHAT A TRUE PATRIOT LOOKS LIKE 🤣🤡,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T10:29:45,19

"MS stands for Mara Salvatrucha. Mara is slang for a gang, coming from a type of ant, Salva is for Salvadorian and trucha is slang for paying attention. It means ""Alert Salvadorian Gang""",DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-19T11:53:16,2
Look at how this is received in other subs all over reddit.  He's a hero in their eyes.  It's legitimately insane.,DJHJR86,2025-04-18T08:58:58,27
"There once was a time when the TV news counted the days American hostages remained in captivity.  That got them an electoral red ocean, so then they realized they needed to become a theatrical performance troupe trying to push things the opposite direction if they wanted to have their own team's way.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T15:05:10,12
"one guy was spouting this crap all day yesterday, when I asked him for a reference on the interpretation, radio silence",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-18T10:35:35,43
"The entire point of this type of gang signalling is to provide plausibility deniability to a judge and rival gangs, and ingroup recognition of other gang members.  It's weird that the guy who hangs out around MS-13 members, who gets immediately recognized by an informant as a member, who wears merchandise used for covert signalling, who is literally from El Salvador, who has multiple other suspect tattoos--  Also has four specific symbols on his knuckles which can reasonably spell out MS13 without even changing the order. There isn't even any weird numerology involved to spell it out, and the combination of symbols is incoherent in meaning any other way.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T11:42:59,11
"I’d like to see an expert on these gang tattoos analyze this since the libs are so adamant that this guy wasn’t involved in MS-13. But really this isn’t going to yield anything more than weight of evidence, it’s not like he has a tattoo of “Mara Salvatrucha” in Old English script.  None of this really matters though.
