"While Trump only holds a Baltic Avenue Card, and someone else already owns Mediterranean Avenue.   Of course, every country should threaten the US with the debt card and encourage him to behave.",steve_ample,2025-05-06T07:14:52,1
Don't SAY it's a card on the table... SELL a bunch and then ask Trump if he wants some more of it?,tommyjaspers,2025-05-06T05:57:38,1
Between China and Japan they have the ability to tank the bond market.   Even if they do not go out of their way to do this it will become increasingly necessary for withdrawal of reserves to support their economies. This is what reserves are for.  The longer tariffs are in place then the more bonds are yielded and the further the USD sinks in value.  Why would investors and nations entrust their reserves with an economy which is the source of their pain and at a rapidly increasing risk of sovereign default?,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T05:32:42,8
"WMFD, weapon of mass financial destruction.  Play that card and it is MAD, mutual assured destruction.  I believe the Japanese are not that reckless even though I am sure they would love to shove a T bill up Trump’s dinner dumpster.",TubeframeMR2,2025-05-06T05:21:08,2
"Yup.  I don’t think they’ll dump everything, which would be fatal to the US economy, but they could dump enough to hurt.  Trump is going to crater the US economy. The man is an ego centric idiot & I’m genuinely worried he won’t back down soon enough.",Cleric_John_Preston,2025-05-06T05:35:48,5
"Not to mention if other countries decide to follow this example, they could easily bully Trump back in his corner and we will suffer the consequences.  Europe has over $3 trillion of our debt as well.  There are other countries too, but these are the major ones.  The reality would hit hard for our economy and carry significant long term pain.  ",arilupe,2025-05-06T05:42:41,2
"Yes, intentionally crashing the US economy is not in their interests but I also suspect that it is already in a downward spiral for a host of reasons. The fall of the Roman Empire comes to mind.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T05:43:15,1
