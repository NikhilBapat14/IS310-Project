Canada is not trolling when they tell Trump to go fuck himself.,sane_sober61,2025-04-25T07:30:58,3429
"Trump does not joke.  He doesn't understand the concept of a joke.  He thinks everything is 100% serious ALL THE TIME.  Even when he says he's joking, he's not because he doesn't understand what jokes are.  We've documented evidence of this.  CC's Roast of Donald Trump was heavily edited BY TRUMP who forced changes to punchlines that made no sense to anyone.  We've had the Correspondence dinner, an event meant to be lighthearted where people take friendly jabs at one another, turn into a funeral procession under Trump, because he does not understand that a joke at his expense is not a personal insult.  When he says something inane like ""I want to take over Canada"" I fully believe him.  Because he does not know what humor is.",ERedfieldh,2025-04-25T07:31:22,763

"As soon as he started talking about taking Canada after getting elected, I saw immediate defenses, calling it trolling or just a starting point for negotiations because he knew how ridiculous it sounded for a president to talk about taking over Canada.  Then he didn't stop. He kept talking about it, saying why we ""needed"" Canada, repeatedly calling Trudeau ""governor"", bringing it up in private talks, and talking about the resources the US needed for ""national security"". And now the far right is talking about it seriously, citing all of the ""good points"" Trump made about it.  It's a tired joke at this point, but it's the old gag of a husband ""joking"" about having a threesome with his wife and a coworker, and waiting to see how his wife responds to keep ""joking"" about it or not. It's a strategy to get the talking point in someone's head so that when you switch gears to talking about it seriously, they're at least not as shocked by it.  He did it with Canada and Greenland, and he's doing it now with the 2028 merchandise. It's only a joke up until it's not. He tells an ""obvious joke"" to introduce the idea, then says he's not joking and dares anyone to get in his way.",TheBlueBlaze,2025-04-25T08:41:46,32

I do think he'll try economic pressure instead of military, but I don't know what he'll do if economic pressure won't work.

"Didn't anyone teach this boy the lesson about not spreading your resources too thin? Like setting all of his horrific plans & actions aside, it's extremely stupid to provoke neighboring ally like this & if it gets bad enough we might see a full front open up along parts of our border.   Then add in everything else, and theoretically this could strain our military beyond its capacity. This is also with the consideration that many of our troops do not have a lot of practical experience & that our population is not prepared for the reality of war.  Mexico is front #2  While the country itself is can't stack up against us alone, they can effectively create a beachhead along our southern border & with the right allies they would be able to put some serious pressure on the US.   Western Pacific is front #3  This is less likely but joint stoke forces from combined Chinese Russian & NK assests scare me enough to mention it.   If we're extremely unlucky the Atlantic Coast line is front #4  This only comes with the scenario where Russia dominates the EU or where Trump destroys what's left of our relationship with the union & there's a reason to attack.   Add all of this on top of how demoralized our population is & how a lot of money is going to deportations I don't think we are in a realistic position to defend ourselves.   There's this red dawn like fantasy that some Americans seem to have that gets fueled by the rights outlined in second amendment, that we aren't the country to invade because a large part of the civilian population is armed, additional it would be extremely difficult for an invading force to hold territory outside of controlling specific regions.  I personally do not believe that our population is prepared for this, especially those of us who believe that they are prepared simply because they own a few guns & boxes of ammo.   War is Hell,   Glory is a lie told by the rich man to the poor man so he has a reason to fight, it is a meaningless & disgusting concept that one should be celebrated for the atrocities they committed.

There is no world where we ""join America,"" or become ""the 51st state,"" other than invasion. If that's his goal, that's the only path that's real. Everything else is fantasy.

"This reminds me of a comment someone made several months ago that I had saved because it perfectly described Trump:  ‚ÄúBRITISH WRITER PENS THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF TRUMP: Someone asked ‚ÄúWhy do some British people not like Donald Trump?‚Äù Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:  A few things spring to mind.  Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.  For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.  So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever.  I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.  But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is ‚Äì his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.  Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.  And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults ‚Äì he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.  There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface.  Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.  Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.  And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.  Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.  He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.  He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.  And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.  There are unspoken rules to this stuff ‚Äì the Queensberry rules of basic decency ‚Äì and he breaks them all. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless or female ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down.  So the fact that a significant minority ‚Äì perhaps a third ‚Äì of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄòYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that: ‚Ä¢ Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and most are.  ‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.  This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.  After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit.  His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.  God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.  He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.  In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws ‚Äì he would make a Trump.‚Äù",KwazyCupcakes12,2025-04-25T10:23:02,102

And while it's accurate to say we resent the US govt for doing what they are doing, we are fully aware that a lot of Americans are not in favour of the policies currently in place, however, the fact that it has happened is what reminds us daily; that the US can no longer be trusted as a trading partner above all others. So while we may not enjoy the current situation, it has pushed Canada to seek deeper integration with other markets in the world, and maintain less reliance on the USA's economy, so, there is an upside, but yes, we're not going to forget this soon, but we don't harbour any ill-will towards the US population at large, but reality is, we can't let that fact get in the way of preserving our nation either.",Maelefique,2025-04-25T09:15:16,8

You have never heard of the protest in Hong Kong in 2016 and 2019, have you?  > If I wanted to protest anywhere it would have consequence (in other words, in a city where it could put actual pressure on national leaders) I'd have to plan a multi-day trip by car.  Oh boy.",KnowerOfUnknowable,2025-04-25T09:41:51,1
"If the handling of the trade war is any indication, America's super capable commander in chief and his defense secretary will certainly find a way to sink their own ships and leak all military secrets via Xitter.",ComprehensiveDog1802,2025-04-25T10:23:15,3

"No, but you'd be surprised once something is primed how easy it is to get it going. Anyone who thinks it's ""impossible"" for their country to get ""here"" in 10 years is naive. It only takes a decade to go completely off the rails it seems.",Ridry,2025-04-25T12:19:31,4

"Nobody in America wants to be the spark that ignites Trump's martial law powder keg. Violent opposition to his bullshit would just accelerate the fascists timeliness, rather than halting it.  As infuriating as it is, the only peaceful checks and balances we have are being soundly ignored by the administration or neglected by Congress, so relying on their incompetence to progress on their own terms is sadly our safest option as we rally our support for midterms, where we can hopefully install proper oppositional legislative actors.",Twl1,2025-04-25T13:54:01,1
"I'm not dismissing their efforts at all. I'm just noting that it's easier to get a large proportion of the population engaged in your effort when everyone lives in the same spot.  There's a reason humans built cities- they allow people to work together and collaborate in ways that are way harder when you're spread out over wider areas.  When the vast majority of the population you need to activate around an issue lives in one place, it eliminates the problems caused by distance and separation.  It's part of why revolutions in France almost always kick off in Paris.  It's got the people and the power structures.  America doesn't really have one overwhelming center of power and population like that.   Yeah, DC and New York are important, but there is no equivalent to the sort of centralization seen in a lot of other countries.",Nodaker1,2025-04-25T09:46:04,4

"Yeah just before the invasion there was a lot of ""Putin would never do that, he's just trying to scare them. If he did attack it would be over in a few days"".... he were are 3 years later and it still isn't over.   I still don't get why Europe didn't take this as an opportunity to destroy Russia.

"Cool. So are you heading up the militia orrrrr....?  You can talk tough all you want, but until there's an actual armed, organized opposition, there's nothing the average citizen can do except rally and protest peacefully, neither of which this administration cares about.  And before the mods pull this down for being ""against the rules"", this isn't a call to arms or a promotion of violence: it's a rebuke of internet bravado. Talk is cheap, and the people we're opposing are in charge of the largest and most powerful military in the world. You don't beat them by instigating the very violence they're craving to justify further atrocity. You beat them by letting them trip over their own dicks and then kick them out while they're fumbling on the floor. Hegseth has already shown he has no idea how to lead the DoD, and I doubt the next Trump ball-licker who gets his position will be any more competent simply because Trump views competency as a threat to his own supremacy.   Trust me, I know it sucks and I understand the instinct to be doing more, but you don't kill Superman in a boxing match; you lure him out of his depth and exploit his weaknesses.",Twl1,2025-04-25T18:59:55,-1
