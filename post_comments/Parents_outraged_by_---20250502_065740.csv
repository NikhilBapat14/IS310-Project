">The driver who killed Oliver was Amy Weiss, a local middle school teacher. It was later revealed that the 54-year-old had been texting nearly every 22 seconds in the half hour leading up to the crash.  Texting every 22 seconds. Terrible.",Sodola321,2025-05-02T07:43:22,124
">Oliver Stratton was killed in his Colorado neighborhood by a texting driver  The political majority in Colorado has voted and will continue voting to enable this, the solution past that point is voting with feet.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-02T07:43:48,69
I'm in awe of these people's restraint and civility is seeking harsher sentences in these situations; if it where my kid I'd likely be in prison or on the run at this point. ,According-Activity87,2025-05-02T07:04:30,69
">""In Colorado, because this was charged as a traffic misdemeanor, they classify texting and driving as careless behavior instead of reckless, even though it is a purposeful choice,"" Clarissa said. ""They put it in the same category as being distracted by the sun.""  >Weiss was granted work release, meaning she serves her time at a facility but can leave for work, church or appointments. She also, according to the Strattons, successfully petitioned the court to attend her daughter's out-of-state graduation.  >""Every important moment of my child’s life is over. And the judge didn’t want her to miss her daughter’s graduation,"" she said.  >""Texting and driving is the new drinking and driving,"" Clarissa said. ""We have to stop pretending like nothing can be done.""    I do not think prisons and jails need to be inhumane, which is what I thought this article was going to be about before I read it. But that's not what it was about. I am biased as a mother of a young son **but I still stand by my opinion of completely agreeing with the parents here.**  Texting while driving (and speeding similarly) are choices. The sun glaring in at you, blinding you, is not. She could have waited to text or parked her car to deal with what she needed to deal with. There is NOTHING that justifies texting or drinking while driving, so they should be treated equally. I even believe that drinking and driving should be even harsher of a punishment before killing someone because the statistics on how many people drink and drive (and multiple times) is appalling. So clearly, people are not that afraid of the consequences.   **People need to be so scared of the consequences that they never risk drinking or texting and driving in the first place  to lessen the amount of innocent lives affected by another's horrible choice. We should be proactive with these serious risks instead of reactive. This woman being punished for killing a kid is going to do nothing to prevent thousands of other people that are not involved from doing the same.**  I am so so so so sorry for the loved ones that lost this child. My heart hurts for them.",duckfruits,2025-05-02T11:34:27,25
Colorado is a repulsive disgrace.,jfoughe,2025-05-03T06:03:31,3
CarPlay. Literally just talk it out. Eyes on the road. I never text while driving and I make sure my kids see that I’m not on my phone ever. I’ve seen too many things on the road of people driving while texting and it’s not good.,RedditorModsRStupid,2025-05-03T06:49:42,1
