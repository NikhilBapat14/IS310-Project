"Pro democracy aid is a tiny fraction of the federal budget. It however delivers big returns for U.S. security, prosperity, and values. Eliminating it is a strategic error, weakening America’s global leadership and making the world, and the U.S., less safe",mikadouglas1,2025-05-06T05:32:24,38

"I mean, Trump is all for dictatorships, both because they're more ""manly"" and because they're more willing to bribe him to get what they want.  So the statements aren't in conflict.  The cuts do in fact make it more difficult for the US to oppose dictatorships, which Trump is in favor of, because he doesn't want the US to oppose dictatorships.",GabuEx,2025-05-06T01:36:20,36

"Presenting anything this admin is doing in a light that implies there's an argument for merit is already asking too much at this point. But, yes, these programs were arms of influence that demonstrated our willingness to step up as a global force and keep nations cognizant that our influence can be more than invasions and clandestine ops.

"Basically a lot of the structure of US foreign policy was to contain Russia and now serves to prevent WW3.  USAid, NATO, most our stuff is designed to mute situations that would lead to a major war or restrict the need for larger powers to rearm because we give them stuff.  Due to NATO's alliance, Europe has kept their own warfighting abilities restricted.    Trump has uncapped all that, so yeah there is going to be an uptick in global conflicts and refugees.  That is a feature, not a bug.  Europe moving to rearm is the interesting one because both world wars started there.    The future history books are going to start off with 'This period started after the election of US President Donald Trump, which saw a massive uptick in global conflicts attributed to the reduction in the US global presence.'",tosser1579,2025-05-06T07:30:07,5
"Do you want to spend money on foreign programs that spread our values, or on bullets that kill people who don't share our values? Those are basically your options. ""Just don't spend money and live in your own little bubble by yourself"" has been disproven to be an effective strategy time and time again. So let's ask again: you will spend money. Do you want it to be for violence or things that attempt to avoid violence?  If you can't guess, I'm pretty firmly on one side here and frankly anyone who's got a quality education on this stuff is on the same side. The argument in favor of programs like this is so overwhelming strong and that's not even counting the moral angle. Purely for protecting the interests of our own countrymen, spending on stuff like this is a massively good move.   If you want to argue with this, fine, go right ahead. The evidence does not support that perspective, though. It just doesn't. There are dozens of books you could read explaining why. But if you were willing to do that, you probably wouldn't argue this point so strongly to begin with. There's a reason we have a lot of programs like this.

"If the loss of US aid causes suffering, another nation or political actor is likely to find a way to exploit that.  Put aside the humanitarian aspects, and it still makes good sense generally to fill the political vacuum so that someone else doesn't.  There was a time when Americans understood this.  The Berlin Airlift not only prevented the people of West Berlin from starving, but it also showed that they could have some faith in the Americans with whom they had been at war just a few years earlier.  The US showing resolve kept the Soviets at bay.  All of that was a bargain compared to the cost of another hot war.",I405CA,2025-05-06T10:21:59,3
"So your question, if I get this right, is: who's right, the convicted felon president, who isn't sure if he's required to uphold (let alone respect) the constitution, who is deporting people without due process, and his nazi saluting narcissistic billionaire womble who is aggressively cutting every governmental organisation with which he disagrees under the guise of ""efficiency""?  It's not about ""woke"" - woke isn't something they can accurately define, even. The best they can do is ""everything we disagree with is woke"". It's about being able to whatever they want, and by calling it woke, their base will accept it because they've been whipped into a frenzy for the past decade or so believing that the big bad ""woke"" is going to ruin their lives. If you find yourself talking to someone who still believes that Musk/doge is about efficiency, and is actually saving money - just ask them what exactly is woke about USAID? What is woke about the IRS, what is woke about the people maintaining the nuclear arsenal? What is woke about due process? What is woke about judges, and what's anti-woke about arresting judges?  Take it a bit further: you won't have to look far to find some MAGA sycophant who readily brings up Hunter Biden's laptop who couldn't tell you the first thing about it, and what little they do know is more often than not something they got off of social media or fox news. You know, because Fox news - as the largest news network in the US- is obviously not main stream media, and obviously is trustworthy along with facebook posts and right wing youtubers.      Cutbacks in government spending aren't de-facto wrong based on who makes the cuts. Is there excessive spending in government? Sure. Is there corruption? I don't doubt that there is. What the question ought to be about is: why are things getting cut, based on what evidence, and what's the result? In this case, Musk is clearly cutting heavily in agencies that could interfere with his business interests (and even then, he's too incompetent to make it work for him). Russia is absolutely loving the Trump led self-destruction speedrun the US has started, and China is quietly, but diligently, swooping in all over the place to pick up the pieces. Therefore, if Trump & Co are justifying their actions through buzzwords and slogans like ""woke"", lets evaluate their level of ""right-ness"" by their own standards: MAGA. Is Trump making America Great? It's making it a great mess - America is rapidly isolating itself from the world, and will lose its seat at the table before too long. If you don't trade, you're no longer an important partner, you have no interest, nor influence on the economy of others, and what means they did have to exert other means of power (including soft power & influence through USAID) has been gutted. If the goal is to make america great, then the people in charge are doing it wrong.",evo_zorro,2025-05-06T11:20:15,2
"This shouldn’t be a real question. Of course funding efforts like this is important. In normal times, there could (and should) be good faith debate about the appropriate budget. That debate would then ultimately meet somewhere in the middle…but “meeting in the middle” is not what this administration is interested in doing. There is no universe in which an 80+% cut in ANYTHING is sustainable for literally any going concern, of any kind, anywhere. An 80+% cut is a laughable suggestion - with potentially tragic consequences.

"Trump doesn't understand how the US's hegemony isn't just based on big army. While USAID (so sadly) did a lot of good, part of it's mission is spreading US influence. It's called soft power. Trump has no clue what all these programs are doing. And we can argue that it's bad for the US to use it's influence to condition minds of people to more likely to view us as ""good."" But just ripping these systems out of place is insanity.

"Yeah. Trump says he wants to cut the deficit yet is demanding first an unlimited credit line from congress to run up the debt by however much he wants, then when they said no he dropped it to wanting to run up the deficit by about $5.5T, while also taking a chainsaw to all the programs that help working class people and foreign policies, but to give a much bigger tax cut to billionaires who already pay their lowest tax rate in history thanks to his previous tax cuts.   And all those foreign policy budget items aren't just gifts - that's what maga fails to understand. We are buying things from those countries. It helps us both. We get to have bases on their land, for example. We get preferential trade status, etc.   Trump is just preying on the ignorance of the masses as usual, to cut anything that benefits our future so he can give the money to himself and other ultra wealthy people who are not really Americans but are more like globe trotting elites who have a hq in the US so they can claim the benefits of living here.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-06T18:18:34,5

"What an odd reaction to that dude’s comment. Not every comment on here needs to be backed up with evidence, and I thought he made his point soundly enough without it. Also, you can use critical thinking to realise that all of these programs would not have been put in place in the first place if they didn’t in some way benefit the US. Most states are, and the US especially is, inherently selfish. It’s very unlikely programs like the ones OP discussed were created if they didn’t serve US interests and didn’t have some kind of evidence or theories to back them up. Back when we didn’t have uneducated, bratty children in charge there were usually decent reasons to do these kind of things. Nowadays that’s simply not the case.",NewTigers,2025-05-06T04:29:55,9
"I mean, with all due respect, why should I put in the effort for a conversation if I don't know that someone is actually willing to listen? This is a pretty one sided situation. In my experience, when people take what is a pretty black and white discussion and try to go out of their way to find some gray, particularly on political matters, there's usually some bad faith. This IS the correct answer. You getting upset I didn't show my work doesn't change that.  Put it this way. Imagine if someone here asked ""are we really sure 2+2=4?"" The answer to that question is ""yes, we are sure, and there are mathematical proof for that if you care to know them."" But it's kinda silly to get bent out of shape that someone doesn't leap at the opportunity to write out a whole mathematical proof for what is a rather elementary question. If someone is asking because they're curious about the proof, then by all means, I'd be happy to share! But if someone is just trying to argue, then I'm much less interested.  I am not attacking anyone. This is a rather elementary question. It's the kind of thing you'd study in your first year of a political science degree. There's nothing wrong with not knowing something, and presumably the only reason to ask a question is because you don't know. Me pointing out that they don't know shouldn't be seen in a negative way at all.   If someone asks a question, giving the correct answer isn't wrong. If they then want to have a question that fully explores WHY that's the answer, then that's perfectly reasonable as well. They are free to ask why instead of getting all pissy at me.",mormagils,2025-05-06T04:05:31,13

"IMO it's not odd at all if you take it at face value. I think I was pretty clear that I wasn't reacting to the commenter's obvious position on issues. So, I don't really need convincing there.  What gets me worked up is the way people converse and discuss issues today. When people express a point of view, too often it's enough to simply establish your general political or social ""side"" and then talk down to your opposition. (This happens on all sides by the way) Look at the commenter's first paragraph. The takeaway is you're either a rational human being or you want to kill people. Paragraph two is that his argument is so strong you are uneducated if you disagree. (Oh, and let's throw in immoral for good measure.) The last paragraph is you're welcome to disagree...but you'd be wrong, and if you'd bothered to read anything you wouldn't have asked the question in the first place. Oh...and by the way...it ""FING WORKS"". The end.  That's it. There is absolutely nothing of substance there. It's one long ""If you disagree you're stupid"". Period. Well, guess what? There are people out there who are educated and well read who think there is massive waste in these programs and that they don't actually provide the value their supporter's claim. And they have data and studies that support them too. And they vote, and they hold office, and they're in the f\*\*\*\*\*\* White House!! So, guess what? When someone like OP comes along and poses a ""stupid"" question like which side is right, you better have a better answer than ""it just fucking works and you're uneducated and immoral if you disagree with me"".

"I have to respectfully disagree with that line of thought. When you examine a subject from a layman's perspective, which accounts for roughly 99% of the public, the interpretation of facts often leads to a different conclusion than when approached from a more advanced, multi-dimensional perspective grounded in education and specific focus.  Your example that ""2 + 2 = 4"" is only partially correct, and it applies strictly within general education level arithmetic. When viewed through other lenses, the outcome changes.  In modulo arithmetic, 2 + 2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  In Orwellian logic, 2 + 2 = 5, used as a symbol of manipulated truth.  In rounded math, round(2) + round(2) can yield 3, 4, or 5 depending on method and precision.  In quantum superposition, |2⟩ + |2⟩ results in a superposition, not necessarily a classical “4.”  In quantum interference, 2 + 2 can equal 0 under destructive interference conditions.  What we accept as ""truth"" or ""fact"" can vary dramatically depending on the context, framework, or system of interpretation.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-05-06T07:17:30,-5

"Respectfully, speaking as someone who is educated in this issue, I haven't met anyone who is also educated in this issue and thinks these programs, broadly speaking, don't work. Sure, there's waste and sometimes certain ones might not work for a variety of reasons, but as a general rule, the studies and evidence and data is pretty one sided. It should be noted that actually most politicians are NOT trained in political science, so just because they are elected or in the White House doesn't mean they are policy experts. It just means we've chosen them to lead on the current administration's policy agenda.   Yes, I'm somewhat combative because in my experience, more than 75% of the time when someone asks a question like this, they aren't actually interested in the data anyway. They just want to argue and fight for their position they think  is right. Frankly, I'm trying to weed out guys like you who aren't the least bit interested in the actual question or the topic being discussed and instead get hung up on rhetoric or style or tone.   You're complaining I don't have any data yet you provided none yourself nor asked for any from me. What a surprise, except it's actually not a surprise at all and that's why I don't go through all the effort to show my work when no one I'm talking to will actually read it anyway.",mormagils,2025-05-06T08:12:04,6
"This is nonsense. If someone has enough knowledge to apply a lens that would make 2+2 unequal to 4 then they have the lens to understand why we broadly say 2+2=4 without further clarification. The thing you're talking about is several layers _deeper_ than the thing that's being discussed.  To move away from this analogy, sure, there is some debate to what extent these programs are effective and some are obviously more effective than others. There are multicausal factors that affect how much return we get from these programs.   But those are lenses that are only able to be understood properly with a starting foundation that includes recognizing the fact that foreign aid spend one option in a forced choice that includes much less palatable spending options as the other choice.

"I respect your desire for clarity and intellectual honesty, but reducing the topic of foreign aid to a binary ""correct answer"" misses the deeply entrenched historical, psychological, and geopolitical factors at play. This isn’t a matter of arithmetic, it’s not 2 + 2 = 4. It’s closer to game theory, human nature, and centuries of evidence suggesting that good intentions often get weaponized.  First, human nature and war, our species has a consistent track record of conflict. Anthropological, historical, and sociopolitical data show that when resources, power, or ideology are at stake, cooperation quickly breaks down. We don’t live in a world where aid guarantees peace, it often delays inevitable conflict or even exacerbates it by propping up corrupt regimes, deepening dependency, or creating proxy battlegrounds. Aid, without strong accountability, becomes a tool of leverage, not benevolence.  Second, the illusion of democratic prevalence, you mention foundational knowledge, but let's expand that lens. Out of 195 countries, about 75 are classified as democratic. That means roughly 62% of the world operates under authoritarian, hybrid, or outright oppressive regimes. Foreign aid in these contexts often sustains rather than reforms those systems. It’s naive to treat aid as inherently productive without scrutinizing who receives it and how it’s used. You wouldn't pour gasoline on a fire just because water is too expensive.  Third, inevitability of world war, if you study cycles of empire and conflict, Spengler, Turchin, or even the realpolitik views of Kissinger, you’ll see a recurring pattern. As global powers shift and multipolar tensions rise (think U.S./China, NATO/Russia, India/Pakistan), the question isn't if conflict will escalate, it’s when. Foreign aid becomes a bandage on a hemorrhage when we use it to delay confrontation rather than prepare for or prevent it structurally.  So yes, maybe you don't start with modulo arithmetic when teaching addition. But if you're trying to predict the trajectory of a global system that's already failing its foundational math, you need to understand the complexities beneath the surface.  edited for clarity.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-05-06T14:09:12,1

You're free to pick up where I left off.  This entire conversation has literally just been you taking exception to my tone and style. You would prefer a more robust answer that included data, and instead of filling the void, you got bent out of shape at my communication choices.

"Just because we can get complicated doesn't mean we have to. If two math PhDs were discussing what 2+2 equals they would have a much different conversation than undergrads. You're right that we can go deeper than I did, but we can't immediately jump to that level of complexity if we aren't starting with some basic understanding.   For example, you're absolutely right that foreign aid isn't some magic pill that creates peace. But the framing of this question--is foreign aid effective and if not should we just not do it at all--isn't having the conversation you are having. Even if you want to point out that 2+2 doesn't always equal 4, it's still WAAAAAAAY more wrong to ask if it equals 100 instead.   The idea that foreign aid is inefficient and is just woke virtue signaling spending that accomplishes nothing is so much more wrong than bluntly saying foreign aid is effective.

When everyday people try to make informed decisions, like in the case of the original post, they're doing so without that deeper context. It's like asking someone who only understands basic arithmetic to solve a calculus problem.   If someone's only source of information is mainstream media, regardless of political leaning, they're working with an incomplete and often oversimplified picture.
