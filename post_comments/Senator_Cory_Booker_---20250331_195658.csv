I'm watching now!  Sen Cory Booker is on fire!,kulukster,2025-03-31T23:28:41,22
Cory Booker has entered the ring for the Dem 2028 ticket! Can he tumble with Walz and Kelly? Can he knock out AOC? Let's find out!  Personally I feel like he's gonna be a VP shortlist but it's fun to have him in the race.,Rosebunse,2025-03-31T22:29:28,13

This is what we need more of.  Here's hoping Sen. Booker inspires the rest of the Democratics to wake up and start doing something.,wiscosherm,2025-04-01T04:57:57,2

"Not sure when this is getting downvoted.  Dems may like AOC, but quite a few who voted for Trump will need to be convinced to vote for  Democratic president.  AOC is too far left.  Dem Party will need to find a moderate who can get votes from both sides.",acoffeefiend,2025-04-01T22:39:26,3
"If you don’t want another Democrat president, convince the entirety of the current administration to resign.",BusinessBoat4148,2025-04-01T19:30:36,1
