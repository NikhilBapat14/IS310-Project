The EOP refers directly to the staff that support the office of POTUS while the cabinet refers to the executive branch departments.,Standsaboxer,2022-09-30T07:39:32,17
"The issue with the Cabinet is that because it requires Senate confirmation, and is a very publicly visible office, it can lead a president to choose someone for reason other than 100% competency in that role. Not that I'm saying it leads to folks being selected who are unqualified, but the point is these are the president's closest team of advisers who do the most direct actual executive branch stuff and having to consider ""what will the public think"" when getting guys for those positions is somewhat sub-optimal for an effective administration.  The other issue is that the Cabinet is very issue specific, which makes it rigid. Think about the play *Hamilton* where Washington is asking Hamilton to serve and Hamilton keeps cutting him off with ""Treasury or State?"" Washington selects Treasury...and then in later cabinet meetings, the actual Secretary of State, Jefferson, attempts to use his position to undermine Hamilton's advice on foreign matters.   I get that *Hamilton* is a dramatic rendering, but the point serves: the Cabinet is somewhat subject to political expediency and can often be somewhat rigid in its structure. The EOP solves this. The EOP is basically just extra advisers that the President hires to be on his closest staff, on par or maybe even closer than the Cabinet secretaries. So if there's a guy that you *really* trust in general and want him involved in all policy making discussions no matter the topic, he might make sense for the EOP. Or if there's a time you selected a Cabinet member that is extremely qualified and knows their stuff but also you really wanted another guy who didn't have quite the same political advantages, stick him in the EOP. Or even maybe there are two really great candidates for a cabinet role and you really think both could add something valuable to the administration--so hire them both, one in the cabinet and one in the EOP.  Think of the EOP as additional high level staff that can support the work of the Cabinet. Even without the EOP, Cabinet secretaries have way more work to do than can ever get done. The fact that lots of voters don't understand the government well enough to know who those staff are or what their role is only helps the President have the ""best staff"" he can.",mormagils,2022-09-30T08:30:26,8
"That's interesting. Here in Brazil things are really different. Presidents dont need the approval from congress to choose their ministers (but still needs to pick elected policians to be ministers to have a political base on congress). They have ""secretariats of the presidency"" but It is Just like other minist√©rios but with different name.",Available-Attitude61,2022-09-30T10:34:51,2
"Right. The EOP emerged because the Cabinet can at time be slightly inflexible. I mean, considering when the US Constitution was written, it's not terribly surprising, and it's not necessarily a bad thing since the system did innovate the EOP to correct that. It's kind of similar to the written vs. unwritten constitution debate. A written one has the advantage of having hard source material to build and maintain legitimacy, but has the disadvantage of rigidity to innovation. An unwritten one is more flexible and responsive to change, but that can also be a downside if it harms legitimacy.  Brazil seems to have a more middle approach. No confirmation allows for more flexibility in creating an efficient organization, but in exchange Brazil requires candidates to be selected from a specific pool.",mormagils,2022-09-30T10:51:31,1
