"""It's so unfair that Russia has been treated very badly."" /s.  As with everything Trump says, this statement is outrageous. Russia was kicked out of the G8 because they invaded and annexed Crimea. I would not be surprised if the US were kicked out of the G7, at least until Trump is ousted. Trump is creating worldwide conflict and siding with Russia.",smithpd1,2025-05-07T13:01:54,6
This dude has no knowledge or rational around what he says. Just says whatever is in his big lunatic mind.,kindandempathy,2025-05-07T13:17:32,5

"look at Grok's moronic notes under a tweet about it:     *The X post captures Donald Trump speaking at a World Cup event on May 6, 2025, linking Russia‚Äôs 2014 expulsion from the G8‚Äîdue to its annexation of Crimea‚Äîto ongoing global conflicts, claiming it may have led to ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of deaths, a statement lacking direct evidence.*  * *Russia‚Äôs G8 removal, spearheaded by Obama and Trudeau, was a response to its violation of international law in Crimea, with Canada and Germany consistently opposing Russia‚Äôs return due to its continued actions, as noted in Reuters reports from 2020.* * *Trump‚Äôs claim of millions dying ties into his broader narrative on the Russia-Ukraine war, but credible estimates, like the U.K.‚Äôs 2024 figure of 750,000 Russian casualties, show his numbers are exaggerated and unverified, per Newsweek‚Äôs fact-check.*     No fact check, of course not  fuck you musk",ElPlywood,2025-05-07T12:47:18,5

Just like how people ask where was Obama on 9/11? Why didn't he do anything?,Logical-Witness-3361,2025-05-07T12:52:38,3
I thought he hated Russia again and was sternly wagging his finger. He could not be more transparent when he tries reverse psychology on the public. He always goes back to what he really wants.,MixRepresentative819,2025-05-07T13:54:24,3

"It‚Äôs incorrect to say ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt kick Trump out‚Äù. If they can kick Putin out, they can kick anyone out given merit.   Yes, technically now it‚Äôs too late since invitations have been accepted but not impossible in theory. Next upcoming years, they can majority vote if they want to invite or not and can rule not to (which would not be politically and economically smart but still very possible if they think there is no alliance just like Russia).",disindiantho,2025-05-07T21:16:43,2
