trump is welcome to prove all of us wrong and defend ukraine now that russia is attacking OUR natural resources. right?,assprxnce,2025-04-30T17:06:21,9
"So, then, Russia is busy stealing Trump‚Äôs minerals. Maybe the US military shouldn‚Äôt be farting around so much on the Mexico border.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-30T16:46:05,7
"I‚Äôm curious as to the details here. I dont necessarily trust Trump or Putin, but if we are going to have a bigger financial and potential personnel presence in Ukraine, that could theoretically mean that it becomes difficult for Putin to wage war since he risks a much much larger conflict instantly.   Again, I‚Äôm not a fan of what is essentially extortion here, and I‚Äôm not convinced this will even really work out, but I want peace of some kind in Ukraine, and if this does achieve that I‚Äôm not going to let my distaste for Trump color what is largely a good thing.",BFNentwick,2025-04-30T17:09:49,6

"So, the US extorted Ukraine, and you can bet your ass many of those resources are ""somehow"" going to make their way into the hands of Russian oligarchs.   Wait, hear that? It's the sound of European countries ramping up domestic military production and capabilities even faster.",JWTS6,2025-04-30T16:51:29,2
"Based on the limited information that's come out on the agreement, it doesn't sound all that bad at all for Ukraine. As a starting point, all profits from the fund over the next decade are to be reinvested into Ukraine.   The only caveat is that the Trump admin has renegged on previous agreements already.",babayga-uk,2025-04-30T18:06:56,2
">‚ÄúWe made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do,‚Äù Trump said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House earlier Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also good for them because you‚Äôll have an American presence at the site, and the American presence will keep a lot of bad actors out of the country or certainly out of the area where we‚Äôre doing the digging.‚Äù  Trump is so stupid that even reading text of what he says hurts my brain.  And lets say Russia restart the war and ""accidentally"" kill American workers, are we going to war with Russia?",wizgset27,2025-04-30T16:48:42,3
The only one that can stop the war is Putin and he's shown time and time again that he will not.  And played Trump like a fool time and time again.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-30T16:41:08,2

"*From Bloomberg News reporters Daniel Flatley and Natalia Drozdiak:*  The deal will grant the US privileged access to new investment projects to develop Ukraine‚Äôs natural resources including aluminum, graphite, oil and natural gas.  It‚Äôs been seen as critical to nurturing Trump‚Äôs goodwill toward Kyiv as his administration pushes to end the war that began when Russia mounted its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.  After weeks of Ukrainian and US officials wrangling over the text, momentum toward a breakthrough was building early this week, with Ukrainian negotiators visiting Washington to iron out final details.

Watch trump send them over and order them to support russia because he and putin have a deal to divide up their resources. And as soon as russia takes over ukraine they'll just dismiss the US because putin is a liar too.,ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-04-30T20:13:57,1
