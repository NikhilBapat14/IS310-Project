"> This is not the first time TikTok, which has its European headquarters in Ireland, has faced a significant GDPR penalty from the Irish court. In 2023, the company was ordered to pay $367 million for its handling of children’s data.  Did they pay the first one?",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-05T08:49:51,6

"TikTok is one of the few platforms (x and rumble are others) that allows the monetization of conservative content. As such I see a lot of conservative view points when browsing because like it or not people follow the money.   There was a deluge of Pro-Trump content right before the election, which is why I think he changed his mind, because it benefited him.",DavidZayas,2025-05-05T10:53:24,13
Which just means more hassle when you go to a website.  It's also an objectively worse experience if you are running a half-decent ad-block software that was already blocking those cookies.  Thank you EU for making me half to click away a nag screen every time I go to a website for the first time.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-05T13:34:41,3
