"The greatest dissappointment for me was my fellow Americans. There were so many warning signs, so many off ramps for the majority of people to realize ""Oh, wait, hold on a minute this is FUCKED."" But it took him fucking with the money to get people to somewhat care (I'm not even confident they still do).

On the flip side, once the collapse occurs, classical reality takes over and it remains as one or the other.

I agree but its hard to fight the goons when they control the military.  This is not going to end because of fair elections.,jpcapone,2025-04-15T14:04:03,3
