">“I think that on some levels, if we can all take a step back, Donald Trump is a ridiculous person. He’s a ridiculous leader.”  It's truly shocking that we even have to question whether a leader should possess basic competence. I mean, really, the whole thing just stinks of... something... But then, you ask yourself, why are Republicans so hesitant to speak out, despite the clear signs of, well, all of this? It's concerning to consider that they might be afraid, or just complicit. It makes you wonder what kind of compromises they're making to stay in power, a terrifying thought, honestly. And you have to wonder what that says about the state of our democracy... what kind of message that sends. I just... ugh.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-24T08:43:42,1306

"Ultimately, he's a lame duck. He's a lame duck that's exercising unconstitutional, overreaching power over the executive branch, but he can't make law. He can obscure and deny law, but he's losing across the board in the courts. Yes, in some cases they aren't listening to the courts, but in many others they are. In a way, the lawsuits are ""flooding the zone"" for this administration. They can't possibly keep up with all of them, and their lawyers are truly terrible at their jobs.  Moreover, it seems that this admin has failed to actually build any sort of coalition in congress, so their movements on bills are very jerky and not unified. They hold extremely slim majorities and that gives a lot of power to different wings of their party, and even to democrats in their own ways.  We get closer to midterms every day, and if you really look we're practically already in a sort of early campaign season. Democrats are trying to gather themselves to create a more unified front (you see this in efforts from AOC, Bernie, and Waltz, and others). This is the worst consumer sentiment has been in decades, and people will remember that going into midterms. The best chance for a blue wave is to pound the table on the economy and jobs.

"There might not be a single historical parallel to the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. There is no other example in world history I can think of where someone so openly unfit and unqualified was democratically elected to run a 1st world country not once, but 2 times. I say ""democratically"" with full knowledge that Trump and the GOP tried to ratf\*ck both elections with varying degrees of success.  So yeah, early 21st century America will go down as one of the most self defeating and dangerously ignorant societies in world history. You literally elected the one individual who is singularly capable of not just irreparably damaging the entire democratic world order in just over 3 months, but doing so in a manner that sabotages your own civil, cultural and economic standing in the process.

The main takeaway for me is the “lame duck” argument.  The public needs to accelerate this notion to effectively neuter him.  Once he realizes the degree that people are turning on him his infantile insecurity will force him to reverse course since he wants so desperately to be liked even though he says he doesn’t.  The recent Fox poll has to stab him in the heart since he is underwater on virtually every issue.

Attacking Trump is not what The Good Guys would do.  Attacking is something The Bad Guys do.  So, the Dems can't ever attack.  Not unless their opponent is just jaw-droppingly evil.  Attacking anything other than pure evil is wrong.  Yelling talking-points all day, every day - is wrong.  That's what The Bad Guys do.  That's what the Republicans do.  So, the Dems can't do any of that!  They have to go with bipartisanship and *healing the country* instead!  The Dems tried all this during the election, remember?  They called the MAGA Republicans weird!  And, it worked.  Gang-busters.  Engagement went through the roof!  Remember all that?  When everyone was calling all these weird people 'weird'?    Then, what happened?    Right, the insider reporting that came out a few months later told us what the Dems did after they dropped *They Go Low, We Go High* just that one time:  the Dems knew the 'weird' thing was working - but they intentionally dropped it out of fealty to Biden!  They thought the 'weird' thing was making Biden look a tiny bit bad, so they immediately dropped it forever!  Even though it was working, gang-busters!  They knew it was working and dropped it anyway!  So, yeah, *that* is what would presumably happen with this plan:  they'd try it - it would work - and they'd drop it immediately for some stupid reason, because it didn't signal how good they were.",ClosPins,2025-04-24T10:33:20,-11

"Personally, I believe they want a Republican-led dictatorship. They want to subjugate us. Elected officials are just biting the bullet of fawning over the orange idiot because it's the ticket to them keeping their status and getting richer as a result.  If the GOP can successfully rig our election system, they'll never have to worry about losing their status. They can cede seats to a handful of Democrats in both chambers of Congress to give the appearance of fair elections and continue to tear the government down and mold it to make the rich richer and keep the rest of us subservient.  What sucks for them is that the leader they have to swoon for is a complete and utter moron, who repeatedly engages in reprehensible behavior on record that they have to twist themselves into pretzels to defend. Then, they also have to explain the stupid decisions he makes. If Trump and Musk weren't such fucking morons, they could probably tear the country down without us knowing.  The U.S. population is already largely ignorant of the news and how government works. They just had to take one cookie out of the jar at a time. Instead, they shoved their hand in the jar, grabbed a handful, and then smashed the jar on the table to get their hand out because they didn't want to let go.  I'm not a political expert, a historian, or anything. This is just my take on things. Based on what I've learned over the years, the GOP has always had authoritarian leanings. They're just fully exposed now. If you don't believe they were pro-authoritarian, then they've been taken over by the idealogy.

"We are getting close to their ultimate goals, it’s what Peter Thiel/Palantir (an actual german Nazi) is working with Cantor Fitzgerald and their ex-chairman and now commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to achieve. Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-04-24T13:02:29,14

They're not the sort  of MLKs who honed their politics on the streets, who had to make things happen, who had to build coalitions and scrape and fight and rally the public over to their side through hard work and courage.  Our congresspeople are, for the most part, rich, lazy, immensely privileged cowards, fat on donor money and more terrified of losing the lap of luxury than anything else.  These people are donor-fed political cattle. Enshrined by the party, showered in corporate cash. Their life is a life on rails. They show up on TV when they feel like it. They show up to vote when they feel like it, and when they do they vote as their told by the party and their donors, and they don't rock the boat.  They don't drive. They don't cook for themselves. These are functionally children, and they live their entire lives coddled and pampered on the taxpayer dime. To them, even a *mild* inconvenience feels like violence.   For the majority of us common people, who do not have even a fraction of that wealth and privelege, to fear MAGA when you are rich enough to hire your own private army seems fucking absurd.   After all, politics is a violent business. Politicians get killled all the time, and historically always have. This is not a job that should be held by cowards. You should accept the risk to your life to do this job, and if that possibility scares you, then get the fuck out of office.   Those same people in congress send 18 year olds to war to get shot at for minimum wage. Do you think they'd step in to save a deserter who ran from gun fire? No. They'd say 'that's what you signed up for.'  But these cowards don't want to extend that same standard to thesmelves. But if you are in congress, you *sign up* for the potential violence. You sign up to *be a fucking leader*. Someone who stands by the constitution in difficult times and says, ""over my dead body.""   If you are too much of a fat, spoon-fed fucking coward to be willing to do that then you don't fucking belong in congress. You don't. This isn't a job for rich-ass pampered talking-head nepo babies. Offices should be held by people with steel balls and iron resolve.  The few politicians who are actually taking action in this time - like AOC - are people who haven't been swaddled by this system. Working-class people not shy of a life of actual work. They're not afraid to act because this is the politics they know.

"He doesnt have a good point in reality though, just in fantasy land theory.  For example. I would like for you to name a widely held ""extreme"" leftist belief that is being acted upon legislatively by anyone who is not a republican.   Again, the criteria is:  1. widely held 2. extreme 3. legislative 4. literally anyone not a republican  Conversely, there are several examples of republicans actively pushing extreme right wing ideology. It's not hard to find.   Theoretically, I can imagine lots of horrible leftist things that could potentially be championed by someone at some point, somewhere in history, or maybe in the future somewhere.   Historically, and presently, there exist a very active and motivated extreme right wing movement that is global. There is nothing even remotely close to that on the other side politically.

"You’re exactly right, and I can give a real-life example of this.  I live in one of the 18 US Congressional Districts that went for Biden in 2020, but elected a R to the House. Plastered all over his campaign and House websites was the proclamation that he’d been ‘voted the most bipartisan member of Congress for ___ years in a row.’ Which is a real thing, but all it means is that he co-sponsored the most bills with a D. They were mostly those mundane bills, like re-naming a post office, but it got him that “award,” and tricked Biden voters into thinking that he was bipartisan. His votes, the only thing that counts, are MAGA all the way; he voted for *a national abortion ban.* He has never held an in-person town hall. Not once, despite us begging for one. He did a few telephone town halls, then stopped. His D opponent invited him several times to meet with her on stage for- she didn’t want to scare him by calling it a *debate*- a ‘town hall-style forum,’ but he refused those every single time, too. He owns a home in our district, but actually lives in California with his girlfriend. On our county’s subreddit, people have reported that his office staff *hangs up on his constituents* when they called about the last budget vote. His campaign donors are all wealthy corporations and “foundations.”  Meanwhile, in 2022 and 2024 the D candidate was a woman who IMO, was the perfect balance of conservative bona fides and a solid D, slightly left-leaning, policy platform. American Dream-type background: raised in poverty by a single mom, first in her family to go to college- at West Point, no less- combat veteran as an Army helicopter pilot, got out and used her GI Bill to get a Master’s at Oxford. She’s been working as a consultant and policy writer at the County level for, for example, implementing the CARES Act. She said from the very beginning that she would not accept large donations from wealthy corporations and individuals, and has kept true to her word. In the beginning, she got a lot of attention and support from the DCCC, and was the focus of their “Red to Blue” initiative. *Was.* Then suddenly, mysteriously, they removed her from that initiative and said that instead they decided to use the money, mentorship, etc on shoring up existing D House seats. Because flipping the House was no longer a priority for the DCCC? Puh-LEEZE. The woman obviously was refusing to play ball with whatever the Democrat Party’s true agenda was… my husband and I contributed to her campaign as we were able. She could only afford one TV ad, and it didn’t air very often. She was light on mailers, posters and flyers, and events. I never saw any yard signs or bumper stickers, or any materials the average voter could use to show their support. Somehow, she lost by more points in 2024 than she did in 2022, despite her focus on women’s healthcare rights and fair wages.  Sorry this got so long, but there was a lot of context I thought was important. I stopped volunteering for my local Democrat Party years ago because I became so disillusioned by their blatant betrayal of other local candidates just like they apparently did to this one. I would never, *ever,* vote for a Republican, but I think that more people are finally waking up to how badly the Democrats have done us dirty. Oh, NOW they’re going to start calling The Cult Leader ‘a weak, unserious buffoon?’ Let us know how that works out for ya.

"Thank you for sharing your story. I got downvoted before for saying the Democrats are culpable in Trump's election, but they are. They played stupid games and got stupid prizes. The high level Democrats have had a million chances to build a loyal following through hard work and grit, but for decades the majority of them just drank champagne and avoided rocking the boat, relying on the general liberal bent of college graduates to shore up their support. It's fucking embarrassing for the ""left"" party to have lost the working class so thoroughly.
