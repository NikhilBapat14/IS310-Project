"while i want to see rates come down doesn't the stronger than expected jobs report just mean that there **isn't** as much pressure on the fed to lower rates since the economy isn't failing?  **worse** than expected numbers would be the ""oh, we need to step in and do something fast"" trigger for the fed.  the stronger than expected numbers makes it seem more likely we won't see cuts until closer to the end of the year.",reaper527,2025-05-02T17:35:17,74
"The Fed should lower interest rates because the benefits to the economy, in current conditions, far outweigh the negatives.  The Fed is playing politics instead of doing what’s best for Americans.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T17:05:29,-34
"That might be the expectation, but it’s completely backwards. Low rates don’t just help stimulate a bad economy, they help grow an expanding one.  If production increases at a faster rate than the money supply, we can have both low rates and managed inflation.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T18:07:56,-27
"The Fed basically operates algorithmically to fulfil its mandate, low inflation and full employment.  Inflation didn't meet the target of 2% yet and a strong jobs report makes it *less* likely to lower the fed funds rate.  Plus the inflation data will now start come in polluted with cost-push tariff induced inflation and make it hard to gauge actual inflation.  For the Fed to lower rates at this time would only mean that they want to get ahead of the curve of a potential recession and that wouldn't be great political news for Trump.  We've seen this movie before, Powell doesn't want to have to pull a Volcker somewhere down the road.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T17:34:05,63
"But they won't. Generally they lower interest rates when investors start buying bonds, when people are nervous about the economy they tend to move to bond investments for a safer option, giving leverage to lenders however that's not happening,  it's more likely interest rates will continue to increase Eventually if we take too many more economic hits. The tax cuts might be the only option to stimulate the economy but with the debt issue it's only going to kick the can down the road for inflation.",fordr015,2025-05-02T17:21:27,1
"Huh?  Maybe I’m not understanding you?    Low rates are the classic FED strategy to stimulate the economy.  To stimulate a slow economy - the Fed lowers interest rates to make borrowing cheaper and saving less attractive. This encourages businesses to invest and encourages people to buy more, boosting economic activity.   When the economy overheats (inflation), rates are raised to temper spending and encourage more saving.",cliffotn,2025-05-02T19:07:59,35
"> That might be the expectation, but it’s completely backwards. Low rates don’t just help stimulate a bad economy, they help grow an expanding one.  sure, the point is there isn't immediate pressure where they **have** to do it now. they have the luxury of being able to wait and see how the tariffs shake out before making a decision. the economy isn't forcing their hand.",reaper527,2025-05-02T19:17:32,5
It amazes me that so many are convinced the fed shouldn’t lower rates if jobs are good. Thats nonsense policy.  Inflation is tied to the ratio of production vs money supply. The fed should lower rates when it is likely to produce more than it costs.,dunkeater,2025-05-02T18:10:44,-14
"Those points are both true. The part thats missing is when the economy is expanding with low inflation (a good economy), the fed should keep rates low because production growth keeps inflation in check.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T19:29:35,-20
"That’s my point, the fed shouldn’t just be reactive when forced, it should do whatever action is in the best interest of the country.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T19:30:34,-4
"I think you are unclear on the quantity theory of money.  While inflation is closely tied to the relationship between the money supply and the production of goods and services (or GDP), if the money supply grows faster than the economy's ability to produce goods and services, it can lead to rising prices and inflation.  The economy does not need stimulated right now, lowering the fed funds rate could put upward pressure on inflation, particularly given the good jobs number.  However, if this tariff fiasco doesn't get resolved in the next 60 days, a recession starts to come into view and Powell will indeed get accused of being late.  If it does get resolved quickly, Powell needs to be vigilant in reigniting inflation.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T18:27:40,28
With all due respect - duh.   The Fed doesn’t raise interest rates when inflation is low.  The Fed doesn’t lower interest rates when inflation is still high.    This is Macro Econ 101.  Literally.,cliffotn,2025-05-02T20:47:42,21
"Read more carefully before being dismissive.  As I said, inflation is tied to the ratio of production to the money supply. If production increases faster than the money supply, we can have low rates and low inflation. If the money supply increases faster, then we have inflation. Those two points support each other, not conflict.  You’ve been conditioned by the macro theory that low rates are only a tool for stimulating a weak economy. My point is that this idea is nonsense, and low rates are also a tool to grow an expanding economy even faster.  Tariffs put pressure on businesses to invest here, which is why we can afford low rates as domestic production will grow significantly. You’ve been duped by the media into thinking a recession is coming, meanwhile the economy, and jobs, are doing great.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T18:41:11,-8
"You shouldn’t try simplifying macro economic theory to the basics you learn in Econ 101.  The Fed raised interest rates in Trumps first term when inflation was low. It is slow walking reducing rates now even though inflation is no longer high.   If the Fed cared about nothing more than inflation, you could chart fed rates and inflation and have a correlated chart, but you can’t because that’s not how it works. Look at the other comments citing good job numbers as a reason not to lower rates - not because this coincides with high inflation, but because the mainstream idea is to only lower rates in a bad economy.",dunkeater,2025-05-02T20:54:52,-15
"Oh thank God that we have a towering intellect as you so versed in Keynesian economics to pontificate, soliloquize and generally elucidate us lesser peons who are have been completely led astray by those main stream economists.   Thank you for your service and deigning to sully yourself with us economic ignoramuses.  Your heterodoxy is truly inspiring.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T22:33:59,17
"I have a minor in Econ, two classes and I’d have been a double major, and I worked for over 15 years as a bond broker - I sorta know interest rates my friend.    You aren’t making sense.",cliffotn,2025-05-02T20:58:37,34
"You could try making an honest effort to understand why people disagree with you rather than being dismissive.  Next time, address the points of the argument directly. You failed to this time while simultaneously trying to insult your opponent. ",dunkeater,2025-05-02T22:36:13,-1
Yet you use an appeal to authority fallacy rather than addressing my point. ,dunkeater,2025-05-02T21:00:44,-13
I make an honest effort to understand my cat when he meows at me.  This is similar.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T22:50:54,15
"Because you aren’t making a valid point.    You have shown yourself to be nothing more than one more measly troll, you aren’t here to engage with other conservatives, you are one more troll here to spray your toxicity over everybody else, because it makes you feel good - living in your mom’s basement gets old.    Thing is, I’ve been on Reddit a bit, and I’ve discovered that trolls always have to have the last word. And since you were clearly a troll, and since I am bored with you, here you go it’s a gift from me. You get the last word.   I’m out.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T00:36:49,19
That only reveals how you perceive people who disagree with you. This lack of perspective is why leftists keep being shocked by reality.,dunkeater,2025-05-02T23:02:33,-5
