He is a list of people he has not screwed over:,fastcatdog,2025-05-06T13:02:06,3
My kid was set to get a pretty cool gig with DoD but DOGE wiped that out so now she has no job prospects and will just be coming home to live with us.  So he’s definitely screwed over my kid and by extension myself. And that’s not to mention the hit my 401k took and will continue to take for the next few years. ,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-05-06T14:09:51,3
