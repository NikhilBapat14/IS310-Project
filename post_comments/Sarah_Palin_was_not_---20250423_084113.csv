Sarah Palin defames herself every time she speaks.,thistimelineisweird,2025-04-23T08:49:02,37
I’m honestly shocked that this idiot isn’t part of the clown show maga administration.,MatrimCauthon95,2025-04-23T09:12:09,15
It’s hard to defame a person who boldly claimed she could see Russia from her house.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-23T08:55:59,11
"A Manhattan jury has ruled that the New York Times is not liable for defaming Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial that wrongly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona. This verdict follows Palin's second lawsuit against the newspaper, after a previous trial in 2022 was dismissed due to jury errors. The case highlights the high bar for defamation suits involving public figures, with the Times defending its actions as an honest mistake.",brendigio,2025-04-23T08:56:56,5

She looks like the final boss of a PTA meeting where they voted on banning books and she showed up with a binder labeled “Receipts & Revenge.”,Tenchi2020,2025-04-23T11:54:21,1
She doesn’t read the Times so how would she know?  Ask Katie Couric.,PurpleData8336,2025-04-23T13:25:42,1

"There is an American ex-ball player named Lenny Dykstra. Here's a snippet from his Wikipedia entry:  *Dykstra sued Darling for defamation in April 2020 but the case was dismissed on June 1, 2020, with the judge citing Dykstra's documented reputation as being ""among other things, racist, misogynist and anti-gay, as well as a sexual predator, a drug-abuser, a thief and an embezzler"" as the reason.*   So, legally it is impossible to defame him. She's just about there.",Diced_and_Confused,2025-04-23T16:42:26,1

Thank Ranked Choice Voting and the unwillingness of the Alaska Republican Party to adapt to it. Otherwise she’d be there with Bobert and Green.,Oubliette_occupant,2025-04-23T15:58:49,3
"It makes me ill to have to defend her, but unlike the other side, we like to point out truth.  [She did not say that one specific stupid thing, though she did say plenty of others. That was an SNL spoof.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sarah-palin-russia-house/)",notableradish,2025-04-23T09:46:56,16
"That wasn't the wild part of the statement. And that's not what she actually said anyway. The real quote is:   > They're our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.   It was the fact that she tried to claim it gave her foreign policy experience.   There was a comeback someone said afterwards:    > I can see the moon from my house.

Agreed but I’d go back to Gingrich. She just made it popular to be an asshole.,MatrimCauthon95,2025-04-23T11:13:21,7
"So, just make sure we’re not spreading misinformation, I feel the need to point out the “I can see Russia from my house” was actually an SNL bit by Tina Fey. Sarah Failin never actual said that.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-04-23T10:23:06,4

"> They're our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.  Is the actual quote. Which, like I said, wasn't the wild bit, but the fact that she thought it gave her foreign policy experience.",davy_jones_locket,2025-04-23T12:05:08,2
"Oh, I agree. I used to mock her and say “I can literally see Tijuana from my mom’s house in San Diego, so I guess that makes me an expert in foreign policy with Mexico.” But she didn’t say she could see Russia from her house specifically.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-04-23T13:00:30,1
