"Wasn't it Republicans who'd claimed that the US gov't had been ""weaponized"" to attack the right-wing? They even formed a committee to address it, headed by James Comer and Jim Jordan. And... they found... exactly NOTHING. Yet, in turn, they used their own committee as a weapon to go after Trump's perceived enemies.  Now Trump is POTUS and he's giving DIRECT ORDERS to the DOJ to investigate his ""enemies."" Anyone and anything left-wing.",cytherian,2025-04-26T18:35:07,181

"Trump is going to ban all political parties, other than the Republicans and try to arrest Democrat members of Congress.  This is a given.  The only question is, will Trump wait until 2028?  Or, will he pull the trigger early and go for it next year, right before the midterms?",KimmyT1436,2025-04-26T18:51:32,42

They claimed democrats weaponized it so that when they do it they can say “dems did it first!”  They ignore the fact that the “weaponizaton” was simply investigating wrongdoing and then acting on the evidence. They’re mad someone tried to hold them accountable so they’re lashing out like a child who got scolded for sneaking candy.,GunnieGraves,2025-04-26T22:56:16,8

"Biden made it perfectly clear that he'd not meddle with the DOJ to assure objectivity.  Republicans still claimed that it was Biden's DOJ. It wasn't. Past presidents sought to do the same, except Nixon & Trump.  Trump was so involved with the DOJ in his first term. Especially Bill Barr. Even sent him on specific missions. But this? Bondi was his own personal lawyer for years, FFS. She never should have been confirmed.  This is all on the Republican Party.",cytherian,2025-04-26T22:06:41,13

"Biden was still stuck on the ""promise of bipartisanship,"" and he thought appointing Merrick Garland to do the judicial tasks against Trump would mitigate it looking partisan.   But that failed. The Republicans still said ""Biden's DOJ"" and that it was all a partisan hit job. With all of that heat, Garland got even more mired down in walking things slow to not look partisan. And ultimately he ran out of time. Biden should've seen the writing on the wall and replaced him after the 1st year.",cytherian,2025-04-28T02:59:07,2
