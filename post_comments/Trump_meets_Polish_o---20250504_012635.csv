They sure like the Far Right extreme parties of the world?   Might be telling of something? ,AnoAnoSaPwet,2025-05-04T01:38:56,27
Given the track record so far hopefully ensuring that they will remain in opposition for long time.,JPR_FI,2025-05-04T02:21:38,10
"Getting support from a Putin cock sock like Trump aught to be the kiss of death in Polish politics.  That, and Trump's general impact on other nation's elections has been mass rejection of the far right after seeing the devastation he's causing here.",CrashB111,2025-05-04T02:29:17,9
"Poland has been to hell and back during its history. Trump, let them determine their own destiny without your input. How about fixing your own country instead of fucking up another?",invalidpassword,2025-05-04T02:30:15,3
Poland is heavily Catholic and one of the most beloved popes is from there (John Paul II). I’m pretty sure sucking up to the guy who openly mocks the papacy isn’t going to help their election chances.,Traditional-Win-3368,2025-05-04T07:24:24,0
Expect Farage (mini-Trump) to slither in any time soon.,bickering_fool,2025-05-04T02:56:27,5
JD Vance to Zelenskyy because he met with President Biden in 2024: “How dare you meet the opposition party and say nice things about them”   JD Vance and the Trump administration: *invites far-right opposition candidates from other countries to the White House*,JewsieJay,2025-05-04T07:56:36,3
"On the plus side - it is the *one* thing this administration is batting 1.000 on - pissing off nations with their meddling, economic warfare and playing the victim, incendiary comments and completely blowing their preferred candidates chance.  It has been pleasing to watch.",jlaine,2025-05-04T04:13:30,2
"He never had any intention to “fix” this country. He is weakening the US by dismantling our institutions and ignoring the constitution. The Republican Party and Trump are the furthest thing from American. This is all by design, Trump wants to be a dictator and he is laying the foundation, with the help of the republicans, to achieve this.",Ryslan95,2025-05-04T05:05:11,3

That's all we need is more duplicates. ,AnoAnoSaPwet,2025-05-04T11:11:06,0
It is really comical. ,AnoAnoSaPwet,2025-05-04T11:09:50,1
That’s irrelevant to my comment. Poles in general love the papacy and JPII.,Traditional-Win-3368,2025-05-04T10:17:47,1
