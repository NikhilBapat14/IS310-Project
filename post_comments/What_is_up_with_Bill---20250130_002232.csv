"I still cannot find the full text of HR 722 anywhere (searches finally landed me here), which seems very unusual. I have never had this much trouble before.   I did find some non-govt folks with takes on it being to protect ""born and pre-born"" humans equally, and a petition against it: https://chng.it/PfvrkZgSn4  I prefer to read the full text before I sign petitions or make up my mind on big issues, but this delay is kinda scary on its own, ya know?",marqrs,2025-02-04T15:43:21,3
I'm sure the full text has deliberately not been uploaded on the congress website. Typically new bills are accompanied by the full text within a few DAYS. It feels deliberate to withhold it.,Mysterious-Friend-70,2025-02-07T22:08:58,3
Just an update for the thread ... text still not available.,Mr_McShitty_Esq,2025-02-27T01:39:50,1
"Seriously! I just checked again and still nothing?  Granted I don't read every HR ever, but I have been looking up and reading bills semi-frequently since like 2006-07ish, and I've never run into this before.  It sure is beginning to look like intentional and shady behavior or else gross incompetence, and neither is a good look frankly.",marqrs,2025-02-08T23:37:44,2
"I totally agree, most bills are super accessible super fast. I hate that I can't read the whole thing because then I can't sign anything or take action about it.",Few_Awareness_631,2025-02-09T20:04:28,1
I second this. I've been tracking and reading bills for years and never encountered a lack of text. I looked into it a little further and there are at least a dozen Republican bills from the last month with no information published. Government site says 1-5 days is normal but its been nearly a month for many of these.,Dramatic-Ad-168,2025-02-14T02:31:38,2
