"The mechanics of the process is multiple rounds of voting.  In practice, a ton of backroom negotiation.  In the 1800 election there were 36 rounds of balloting until a winner emerged.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election#Electoral_College_selection)  If your question is how that negotiation would come to a resolution, that's likely above Reddit's pay grade.",takatori,2022-08-28T22:43:05,17
"The only real historical precedent here is the election of 1800, where the contingent election went into round after round after round of voting while the parties went back and forth trying to negotiate until someone emerged a winner. This isn't the *best* precedent because since then we've changed a lot about how we apportion electors, but the overall bones of a contingent election having multiple rounds would still hold.  Eventually, someone would break. Eventually, the parties would negotiate and compromise until someone wins. Either that, or our system would enter a constitutional crisis and collapse. You would *hope* that enough people would put the country over their party and prevent that...but maybe that's not how it would go in the modern US.",mormagils,2022-08-29T09:10:08,7

"If there is a tie in the House Presidential Election but the Senate are able to elect a Vice President, then the Vice President-elect will become President upon vacancy of the Presidency.  If there is a tie in the Senate but the House elects a President, nothing happens. The President could appoint a Vice President after taking office according to usual 25th amendment provisions, but if congress again fails to approve, then the Vice Presidency will be vacant. This vacancy has existed on several occasions and would not present a crisis.   If there is a tie in both chambers, which is unlikely due to the Senate tiebreaker, but possible with abstention or absence, then that would present a greater challenge, presuming that all members hold firm in their votes. With a vacancy in the Presidency and the Vice Presidency, the Speaker will become President.",atxlrj,2022-08-29T14:43:38,2
The Vice President would then be asked to break the tie.,caroubayou2169,2022-08-29T09:30:41,-2

">Either that, or our system would enter a constitutional crisis and collapse.  Would it? Because after the new Congress is sworn in in early January, they elect a ""Speaker of the House"". If the election isn't decided by the electoral college, then come noon on inauguration day the President and VP would vacate the office, and because the office is vacant the Speaker would be elevated to the Presidency.",ProLifePanda,2022-08-29T09:51:34,3
"The 1800 election was under different rules though.  Originally, the person who got second place in the Electoral College would become Vice President.  But Electors got two votes for President.  The expectation would be that one vote would go to a local ""favorite son"" candidate, and the other would go to a more nationally-known candidate (hence the requirement that one vote be for a candidate from another state).  But in reality, national political parties formed early on, and spotted the strategic incentive to nominate *two* candidates for President (thus inventing ""running mates""), so that Electors could vote for both, and the majority party would win *both* the Presidency and Vice Presidency.  (Obviously, this wouldn't have worked under a one-vote system, because it would split the vote and throw the election to the other party.)  In 1800, this plan worked *too* well, so that the two nominees from one party tied *each other*, and required the HoR to break the tie.  A hasty rule patch (12th Amendment) was made before the next election to distinguish between the Presidential and Vice Presidential votes.",NerdyLumberjack04,2022-08-31T07:52:15,1

"That would cause a constitutional crisis and our system would collapse. There is no way the other party would permit such an obviously illegitimate process, nor should they. That kind of thing would be exactly what ends the current American political system.",mormagils,2022-08-29T09:54:32,2
"That's why I said it's not really the best precedent. This is a good example of how when you change the structures, the outcomes change. One of the reasons there was a tie in the first place was because two candidates from the same party got the same number of votes...which everyone pretty quickly realized was a design flaw and that's why they fixed it.  I think one of the underlying points that I didn't really spell out explicitly is that these questions that dive into ""what happens in the case of this complicated hypothetical"" aren't really very great questions because often the whole point of the system is that such a hypothetical wouldn't really occur in practice. There's a reason we've never had a tie since then.",mormagils,2022-08-31T09:02:13,2

"It would depend heavily on which party has the house majority and how the arcane quirks landed on the table.  Remember that speaker of the house doesn’t have to be a house member and is elected by the house at-large.  Also, if a vote for president goes to the house, those are done by state, not by representative.  Also also, the stupid electoral college/popular vote split.   That’s three different “majorities” that can go either way and affect the outcome.  So let’s say it’s 269-269. But the Democrat runs away with the popular vote. And also the Democrats have the house majority. And also won the House popular vote. But the state vote in the house goes 24-24-2.   The Democrats could just elect their candidate House speaker, who then becomes president on the premise that they’re doing what America clearly wanted anyway. That if the electoral college was meant to be a, “hmm. Are you sure?” for the people writ large, then this process is a, “hmm, are you sure?” for the electoral college itself — just an extension of the processes of checks and balances that has worked ‘just fine’ in 2016, 2000, etc. In this scenario it would look pretty similar to the appeals process in the courts:   *The people deferring to the electoral college : the electoral deferring to the House process :: the district court appealing to the circuit court : the circuit court appealing to the Supreme Court.*  Democrats could easily argue that this still forces a compromise “as the constitution intended” by requiring a VP vote from the senate, where they could pick a different VP and pretend like it was the VP pick that America was unsure about in the first place.  All of this would feel pretty palatable and likely be pretty close to the truth in such a situation anyway. Republicans would be able to get some kind of concession, like a promise of a Supreme Court pick or whatever. Everyone would go home equally dissatisfied and things would be mostly okay. However, other scenarios would easily blow up the constitution.   Dems win the Popular vote big for president and in the House. 269-269 in the EC. Republicans have a small majority in the House so they have the speaker. They also intentionally keep multiple states deadlocked, leaving neither side with a majority and do so with the stated intention of keeping Democrats from a majority in the 50-state House vote. Republicans basically refuse to compromise at every place they are expected to, leaving just enough ties at each stage to grab the presidency.   Those two look a lot different, especially if the state electoral college wins in the Republican scenario come in Florida-2000 style or states that they only win with a plurality, not majority.",GeorgieWashington,2022-08-29T19:30:08,1
"Apparently, Jefferson's plan in 1800 was to designate one elector as the ""vote for a fake candidate instead of Burr so we don't have a tie"" guy, but for some reason it didn't happen.",NerdyLumberjack04,2022-08-31T09:18:40,1
"No, it wouldn't. The Speaker becoming POTUS while unelected to that position while 2+ others both have a claim to be elected to that position is the *definition* of a crisis. It wouldn't be universally seen as anything. The Speaker becoming POTUS is in cases of presidential *succession* not in cases of political gridlock. If there's too much political gridlock to even determined who won an election then our government system would have critically failed.",mormagils,2022-08-29T13:57:07,1
The ONLY way you think such a thing wouldn't directly create a Constitutional crisis is if you do not understand the concept of legitimacy. It's abundantly clear that the Constitutional process to resolve presidential succession is not a *replacement* for elections. It's plain and simple: this could not happen in a way that wouldn't immediately damage legitimacy so severely as to make the government's claim to rule be entirely uneforceable.,mormagils,2022-08-29T19:39:47,2

"The Speaker would not *become* President; he would *act as* President until the election was resolved.  >> …the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.",Strider755,2024-01-13T10:02:14,1
"This is nothing more than a technical difference. In this situation, the House _was_ resolving the election by declaring the elected guy not qualified. Your qualification here makes it sound like a temporary measure until a specific uncertainty with Biden was addressed. But that's not what they were trying to do.",mormagils,2024-01-13T10:43:29,1
