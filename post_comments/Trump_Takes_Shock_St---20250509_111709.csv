Just get rid of income tax altogether. It was unconstitutional until the greedy Feds managed to force through an amendment by fooling everyone into thinking it would be temporary to pay for WWI.,Swiftbow1,2025-05-09T19:41:23,10
I think we should have equal tax rates for every single citizen. We have zero liability voters in this country. People that get welfare don't have to worry about tax season. People that don't pay taxes don't really have to worry about anything from the government changing good or bad. They just get free stuff from the government. So they are a zero liability voter.,BossJackson222,2025-05-09T17:06:17,9

"No taxes for under 150k W-2 income. K-1 income tax goes up to normal. Stock buybacks banned. Offshore money laundering i.e. ""globalization"" taxed at normal rates. Stock grants and forgivable loans from biz to executives = income. Companies like Apple no longer get to re-route their income through Ireland. Close all the lobbyist designed loopholes.",thinkingisthehardest,2025-05-10T18:40:24,1

There's some quote from some Founding Father about how this system will only last as long as it takes people to realize that they can vote themselves more money.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-09T19:14:45,6
