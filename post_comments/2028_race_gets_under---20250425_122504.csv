"Excerpt:  *Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says his message to Democrats is that “we’ve got to be ready for the fight.”*  *Pritzker, in an interview ahead of his keynote address at the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s annual McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club fundraiser dinner on Sunday, said the nation is “in a constitutional crisis” and that “we have too many people who are ill affected by the policies of the Trump administration.”*  ...  *“This is the moment for people to stand up and fight,” he said.*  ...  *“I’ve been clear my whole life,” Pritzker said. “The Democratic Party stands up for working people. Stands up for working families. We’re the party of civil rights. We’re the party of human rights. No doubt about that, in my mind.”*  *Pritzker made no commitment to launching a national campaign in the 2028 election cycle.*  *“All I can tell you is, I’m focused on the question of whether I will run for reelection as governor, and on defeating the policies of Donald Trump,” he said.*  ...  *Neil Levesque, the longtime director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said Pritzker will be talking to a captive audience.*  *“Pritzker is coming into a highly political state at an opportune time because of how fired up and charged up Democrats are in opposition to President Trump,” he said.*  *Levesque noted that the stop “will kick off the first of multiple visits by multiple potential candidates considering that Democrats are hungry for an opposition.”*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-25T12:27:03,3
Love JB as governor don’t think he can win the presidency. Dems need to run against billionaires.,Successful-Mind-5303,2025-04-25T12:51:17,3
Pritzker better get on a health kick. We need this mf around for a while.,Hot-Temperature-4629,2025-04-25T16:06:28,2

I will vote for Trump before I vote for a billionaire as the Democratic party standard.,whiskers165,2025-04-25T12:41:34,-9
Trump will win with a 110% vote,TonyStewartsWildRide,2025-04-25T13:13:27,4
I think it's more likely for Pritzker to win in 2028 with 99.97% of the vote.,DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-25T12:29:08,3
"Nah, I disagree. It will not be easy though. We need to resist very strongly, and we need to unify quickly. I think we need Trump out as soon as possible; I think Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is the best pathway. The American people need to continue building the pressure on Congress to act, and quickly.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-25T12:38:57,7
"With your cynicism, you probably didnt vote for Harris either.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-25T12:44:54,5
He’s an amazing governor and I’m proud he represents my state.,OmniHito,2025-04-25T12:58:36,4
"Would you have voted against FDR too? Roosevelt came from one of the wealthiest families in the country at the time when he was elected. Vote for the man based on his record, not the wealth he was born into.",UghFudgeBwana,2025-04-25T13:36:05,3
