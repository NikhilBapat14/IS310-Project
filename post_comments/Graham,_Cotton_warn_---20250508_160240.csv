"So, the US ain't getting a treaty, because I cannot see the US giving up enough concessions to convince the Ayatollah to do that.",DiggingforPoon,2025-05-08T16:06:41,4
"Here is the beginning of the story:  Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) are cautioning that the Senate will not deliver President Donald Trump the 67 votes he needs to ratify a nuclear agreement with Iran if that deal does not require the “complete dismantlement” of Tehran’s current program.  The senators issued the warning during a press conference at the Capitol on Thursday promoting their resolution affirming that the only acceptable outcome of U.S. nuclear talks with Iran would be the total dismantlement of its enrichment program.   Asked why the approval of the Senate is necessary when Trump could technically implement a deal without the legislative branch, both senators noted that his agreement would have no guarantee of surviving in future administrations if not ratified by Congress.  “If they want the most durable and lasting kind of deal, then they want to bring it to the Senate and have it voted on as a treaty,” Cotton said.   Graham noted another requirement of a deal getting congressional support would be its addressing Iran’s missile and terror proxy activities. He said that he told Secretary of State Marco Rubio that, “A treaty with Iran in this space is only possible if you get 67 votes …You’re not going to get a 67 votes for a treaty regarding their nuclear program unless they deal with the missile program and their terrorism activity. So is it possible? Yes, if Iran changes.”  “I would urge the Ayatollah to seriously consider what Secretary Rubio and \[Middle East envoy Steve\] Witkoff are proposing. You can have what you claim you want, which is a peaceful nuclear power program, if you dismantle, but it’s more than that. You can have a better relationship with the United States if you do the things that Sen. Cotton laid out. Without fundamental change, there is no pathway to a treaty in the United States Senate,” Graham added.  “To the Iranian regime: you claim all you want is a peaceful nuclear power program. You can have it, but you cannot enrich and you must dismantle,” Graham said. “And you must dismantle now.”",jewish_insider,2025-05-08T16:03:05,2
"Or, or, hear me out on this...  Trump shouldn't have abandoned the first deal. A deal that Iran was COMPLYING with (all while lacking the ""complete dismantlement"" requirement)!!  The GOP are fucking idiots on the best of days...",LazamairAMD,2025-05-08T16:24:12,7
