"He is literally so dumb and unqualified. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not aware of this, but there are literally hundreds, probably thousands, of studies on autism. He would not know how to read a study on autism though, he has no background in science or autism. I‚Äôd be shocked if he could even name a symptom   Also, I feel HIPPA violations brewing‚Ä¶",tsagdiyev,2025-04-21T20:08:14,34

"Ah, yes. A registry. That's not ominous at all.  Now, to be fair, we've long had reportable medical conditions. Particularly for communicable illnesses but for other things too. So I don't take issue with that at all. But names aren't linked. Just the fact that we observed a case, along with their age and sex and usually city or county of residence.   A registry implies registration, which means a name. That's a very dark road.",KR1735,2025-04-21T20:29:50,22

I swear, we couldn't be following a Nazi playbook more closely if we had resurrected Hitler's actual ghost. I want to chew nails it makes so angry.

"Please someone with school experience correct me if I'm wrong, but don't schools have to report their IEPs to state & federal agencies?
