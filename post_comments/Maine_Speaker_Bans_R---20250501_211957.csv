Is there nothing in Maine's Constitution to prevent the speaker from acting this way? Denying a representative the vote on legislation denies all those constituents their representation.,StillTruthSeeking,2025-05-01T23:31:06,24
"Man, why is it the Democrats doing this?  I thought it was us who are the fascist dictators?  Where’s the Illinois federal judge to send an injunction against this clearly undemocratic and unconstitutional breach!!",j3remy2007,2025-05-02T05:03:39,15

"Here it is...   Maine House Rule 401.12 states that a member who is in the House when a question is put shall vote, unless the presiding officer for reasons excuses that member  BUT....  According to the rules of the Maine House of Representatives, a member may be excused from voting or speaking if they are found guilty of a breach of the rules and orders of the House. However, the member may regain their right to vote or speak after making satisfaction for the breach. Additionally, a member may be excused from house deliberations and roll calls for a debilitating or incapacitating major illness or injury, with approval from the Speaker upon as prompt notice as possible.    Sounds like he would have to have some sort of trial or such since She would have to be found GUILTY of a breach of the rules and orders. This sounds like the Speaker just waved a wand and said she couldn't vote.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T03:55:46,7
