"So, can everyone just agree we are currently in a Dictatorship - from the moment trump told the judges to go fk themselves.   Isn't this up to Congress to declare, not Trump and Miller?   If we are being invaded, and they suspend habeas corpus,  then any of us -  citizens as well as non citizens , can be tossed into a dark hole without cause.   Trump would say this is what we voted for.   Not me.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-09T19:48:49,14

I guess since it's America it's probably fitting that we have a dictator that reads at a third grade level.",Human_Local3519,2025-05-10T08:48:55,7

You... genuinely think that makes a difference to what Trump will do?  Dumb fucker wants to reopen Alcatraz because movies.,ASharpYoungMan,2025-05-10T00:28:09,3
"So what?   Reopening Alcatraz, while stupid, has no equivalency to martial law.   There    Is   No   Such   Thing   In the USA.    It's not a power you can even debate because it doesn't exist   It's why you can't find people that even agree with themselves on what it is.   It's not in the constitution and Congress has neither assigned any such power to the executive branch or even defined what it would even be if it did exist    Furthermore, even maga states would shit on it being used for make believe because it throws their sovereignty in the trash and since we constantly have to go back to middle school civics here powers not delegated to the fed by the constitution are reserved to the states.   The orange bitch has 0 power here. Not one hair.   and who the fuck do you think is going to carry it out?   The military Trump has spent every day shitting on?",Objective_Aerie_2830,2025-05-10T00:38:19,-2
you clearly havent been paying attention to trump much have you. he HIMSELF has mentioned using martial law over and over again. and what he says he will do he HAS been doing. so even if such a thing doesnt exist in the united states HE will make it exist and use it for his own selfish gain. THATS how america is now,saiyanscaris,2025-05-10T04:24:26,2
also for the whole its not in the constitution thing trump also proved he hasnt been withholding the constitution too. cause DUE PROCESS is in the constitution and hes denying said thing,saiyanscaris,2025-05-10T04:25:33,1
"as for whos going to carry it out. maga, republicians, and ice. he likely will force the military to do it too or be arrested like ice has done with judges and mayors",saiyanscaris,2025-05-10T04:26:24,1
Who cares what he says.   He's a dementia patient.   None of these fantasy's he has are going to play out ,Objective_Aerie_2830,2025-05-10T11:37:30,1
