"**Summary**: U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny for repeatedly sharing classified military intelligence in unsecured Signal chats, raising fears of espionage risks. Allies now view the U.S. as an unreliable intelligence partner. Experts warn his lax security could endanger troops and trigger international crises.

They are all compromised, every single one of them. And it only takes one device to be compromised to get a large amount of very valuable intelligence. The US intelligence community is probably feeling pretty depressed these days because of the sheer futility of trying to keep anything secret when the entire government is more compromised than not.

"Looked at in total, we’re just so far beyond the simple stupidity of “we don’t think Russia is a threat anymore so why waste time on them.”  We didn’t even give our closest European allies access like this, back when they were our closest allies.  Because we know that every country, even allies, spy on each other constantly.  But this? For “former” geopolitical rivals that have a documented history of meddling in our internal politics?  This goes so far beyond naivety that it’s unbelievable.   I don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory.  I really can’t come to any conclusion other than that our government is 100% compromised at multiple levels.",Dearic75,2025-04-23T08:33:14,39
"That was known when it was first seized.   Some of the files were marked “HUMINT” which is short for human intelligence.  It’s the designation given to files of our covert agents around the world.   Literally how many movies or tv series over the last century have been spy dramas where the villain was trying to steal a list of all covert US agents?  This is the real life version of that.    Yet he walks away from everything because one highly partisan judge that he appointed himself ruled that despite more than 50 years of precedent, she didn’t believe the attorney general had the authority to appoint independent prosecutors.",Dearic75,2025-04-23T11:03:17,6

"I don’t think it’s really a conspiracy anymore, I think that the Republicans see how Putin controls Russia and thinks that’s a good model for how to control the US without popular support. The rich get richer and control all the money while everyone else lives in poverty, don’t have to worry about winning elections because they are all rigged.

"> But they could do that without blowing the US wide open to Russian espionage.  Republicans can't.  >Yet they seem to be going way out of their way to make it subservient to Russian interests.  Because Republicans want control of USA and money. Some say Putin has dirt on 99% of the Republican party to keep them in line. Republicans are not going out of their way to help Putin, they are working with Putin so they can have more money and more control.   >Considering Russia obviously has the exact same ambitions.  Teamwork makes the dream work. Republicans have been working with Putin for years now. China is the new scary boogeyman. Republicans don't think they will get in trouble so there is nothing to worry about.
