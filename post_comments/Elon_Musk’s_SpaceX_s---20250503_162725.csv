"You more or less have to, in this case. The SuperHeavy / Starship is a very large rocket that has to be launched from a remote location, and SpaceX is planning on launching it very frequently. That requires a lot of people and large facilities. Those people either commute a long way or live in the company town. Same for the Kennedy Space Center, which includes a large industrial area. Boca Chica is relatively much farther away from large population centers than KSC.  But yes, obviously Musk is a narcissist with an endless need to control people, so it's no surprise that he wants to build his own kingdom.",z900r,2025-05-04T03:01:01,2
How recently? Because if you still liked him after the whole “accusing cave divers of being pedos” thing I worry about you.,MooseTetrino,2025-05-04T00:49:19,5
Nah. It was before that. But I had blinders to the bad dumb stuff earlier since Tesla and SpaceX were doing such great work.,nimbus57,2025-05-04T08:58:29,-1
