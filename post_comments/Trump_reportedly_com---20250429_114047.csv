So? What's the difference between showing the tariffs and showing other fees like shipping and sales tax?   Oh is it because one makes Trump look really bad?,NoPomegranate4794,2025-04-29T11:45:40,16
"President Donald Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain after a Punchbowl News report suggested the online marketplace planned on displaying the cost of tariffs next to product prices. White House officials told CNN that Trump called Bezos “shortly after” receiving information about the report.  Before Amazon publicly commented on the report, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Amazon’s rumored move a “hostile and political act” during a press briefing on Tuesday.

"With the shadow of the official 'door locker' having just disappeared around the corner, Ice T's O.G. Original Gangster blared on the other side of Jeff Bezos' office door and he knew he had to get in quickly.  Already on edge because AMZN was somehow down more than 2% before the market was even open, he thought 'Dang, this door is always giving me trouble but I know I can get through it now because I'm Jeff Fucking Bezos,' as he nervously fumbled to get his key in the hole.  Standing inside with the key barely half in, he gave himself a triumphant fist pump and dove for the phone.  'Good morning,' he said deferentially having immediately heard the slurping of an empty milkshake cup quickly followed by the sound of a crumpled up Filet-o-Fish wrapper bouncing off an empty Big Mac container.  His eyes were wide open after hearing the president’s initial comment and then spotting a sticky note on his desk saying “It’s happening!”  'No, Mr. President, that's definitely not happening,' he said.  'Mr. President, I need to run now to congratulate my team for not doing this.  It's been great talki,' is all he could get out before disconnecting the call and bolting for the luckily still open door.  Racing past his secretary and shouting 'Buy calls,' he headed straight for the ‘checkout’ coding team.  Out of breath and thinking ‘No, I don’t need anything else,’ he burst through the doors and screamed ‘Don’t go live!’  With the day saved he called Lauren and invited her to go get some gelato and walk in Lake Union Park while talking about how to stage a baby’s nursery in space.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-29T13:17:31,1

Shocking Bezos didn't bend the knee. Don't you know Trump can just nullify all his AWS bids?,MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-29T11:45:46,0

"Bezos has a bigger dick, even after losing half of it in the divorce. Bezos probably also isn't a Russian asset.    Who cares if he loses the AWS bids? he's probably already lost a bunch already through the cuts in spending. ",NickBurnsCompanyGuy,2025-04-29T21:35:55,1

"I know Bezos jumped on his chariot not that I had any expectation, the washington post not publishinb Ann Telneas satirical cartoon was a great low. This timd what do you mean with he bending his knee? Not happening they what? I heard today Trump bragging about calling Bezos and like he ""understood"" in the usual mobster can't take a no attitude. You mean Bezos had really backed off doing what Trump decided is an ""attack""? Though I get that this is nit really us relying on Bezos for a shred of rebellion but more like whatever puts a cog in his all grinding gears. But at least in Canada his loufmouth backfired, and he saw there's something like pulling the tug too much.",Purple-Atmosphere-18,2025-04-29T20:55:02,1
