"From the article:  >Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that he did not know if President Trump had spoken to President Xi Jinping of China, casting further doubt on Mr. Trump’s recent suggestion that Mr. Xi had called him.  Dementia afflicted Trump had an imaginary conversation in his head with President Xi Jinping. He has confabulated this imaginary conversation into his ""reality.""",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T13:37:21,15
"Trump is a well-known LIAR.  He is LYING.  China - to its credit - is not rubbing these lies in his face.  Bessent 'Demurs'?  Please!  No need to equivocate, or dress it in such terms.    Trump lost.  China won.  Trump is praying for a miracle to save face, and lying about it until he finds a bigger whopper to replace the last one.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-27T13:56:58,6
No longer sure if Trump tells so many lies that he thinks he can get away with making shit up and not get caught or he just outright believes his own lies now. Either way every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie.,Thund3rbolt,2025-04-27T14:02:02,2

"Surprise! He is lying. I know it's a real surprise to everyone. Xi doesn't play games, unlike Trump.",Troubled202,2025-04-27T14:09:12,1
"So the Treasury Secretary decided it would be better to look like an incompetent, out-of-the-loop fool than say something that conflicts with Trump's lies.   Seriously.  How could he not know this information.  Are we to believe Trump would talk with Xi and Bessent wouldn't even be informed, much less consulted?  Is he hiding behind that near-impossible possibility when hedging his comments?",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-27T14:50:39,3

"> China - to its credit - is not rubbing these lies in his face.  Why would they? They know perfectly well that the USA media outlets are going to do that for them. They know the USA government can't pretend that it has ""won"" a trade war with China to anyone but their hard core supporters (who will believe anything, so don't matter).  > Trump lost. China won. Trump is praying for a miracle to save face, and lying about it until he finds a bigger whopper to replace the last one.  Pretty much. The problem with this (for us, not China) is that there is a distinct chance that he'll do something even more stupid and invade one of the USA's allies or some neutral country.",barryvm,2025-04-27T14:03:14,2

"What I don't get is why none of his political opponents are even trying to stop this eventuality? The moment he does this, USA democracy is done anyway because it will trigger a war. The only thing that could avert this if he actually wanted to do this is if you make him afraid of the consequences. Why aren't democratic USA states saying that if he does this, they will rebel, making a war of conquest unwinnable from the start and therefore pointless? Why are they not organizing ways to paralyze a government that is obviously authoritarian anyway? Do they really think they won't use one of the many ways you can cheat USA elections to make the upcoming election unwinnable?  As it stands, the USA is threatening to invade Canada, Panama and Greenland. We're four months in. It will be a miracle if he doesn't trigger a major war.",barryvm,2025-04-27T16:57:52,1
"I think there are a few factors affecting this. Firstly, I think there is a big problem with the leadership of his political opponents. I mean the Dems ran on Trump being an existential threat to American Democracy, but then they obviously did not have a plan in place if he won the election. I know that there are Dems doing things to try to combat some of this. Things like AOC and Bernie doing their Fight Against the Oligarchy rallies, Van Hollen visiting El Salvador, Booker with his historic speech, and Booker and Jeffries doing their ""sit in"", but it does not seem to have any unified message besides Trump being terrible. Which he absolutely is, but they really need to be more unified and, quite frankly, daring in how they address the literal existential threat that is Trump.    Secondly, I think, and I don't have any way to back this up, they just don't think Trump will really push for war. This is incredibly moronic and dangerous to both people across the globe and to global stability itself. Given how Trump has handled the tariffs they are absolute morons if this is the case and they should not be in office in so.  Thirdly, I think, in the case of the Democrats, they have a problem of their current party leaders trying to hold on to both the old ways of politicking and power. I mean just look at Chuck Schumer. Yes, he was in a terrible position in regards to the CR, but holy shit he flip flopped so damn hard and caved so damn quickly. It really showed how the current Democratic leaders do not have a spine at all. This is in addition to leadership roles going to people who did not deserve said position. Dems also have the problem of trying to be civil and bipartisan. The biggest examples here to me are Trump's cabinet appointees being confirmed and again the entire debacle with Schumer and the CR. Those ideas do not work and the Dems need to start actually fighting back before it's too late.    Finally, I think there is a whole lot of fear going around the United States. Trump's supporters are filled with people who are not afraid of getting violent. I mean one of them literally tried to assassinate him! Judges have been getting death threats for quite a long time. So long, in fact, that I think it has been normalized, but that is not something that should EVER be normalized. There was a judge recently that said that they and their colleagues have gotten pizzas delivered to them under the names of deceased relatives. So whoever is doing this is clearly willing to dig to find the addresses of the judge and their colleagues and also the names of their dead relatives. I've even seen articles of Republicans in Congress telling reporters that they are terrified for, what I can only guess, is their lives. Lisa Murkowski is, as far as I know, the only one to publicly address this matter. I think a lot of people are not fully comprehending that political violence has been normalized since Jan 6, and I think that is also reflected in the representatives at both the state and federal levels. Just my two cents about the state of things in my country.",crimsonfang1729,2025-04-27T17:45:41,1
