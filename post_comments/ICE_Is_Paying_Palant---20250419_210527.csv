"I don't think any amount of Due Process™ will satisfy the America-hating Pedocrats, but when I asked Grok what can be done to expedite the process involving 11M cases, one core solution it offered was Grok itself.  >*Leveraging AI to pre-screen cases for eligibility (e.g., identifying those with no valid asylum claims based on country conditions) could prioritize straightforward deportations, freeing up judges for complex cases. xAI’s work on advanced reasoning models could theoretically support such systems*  This was idea 2/5 alongside group hearings, batch processing, post-deportation appeals, and expanding the proximity of the 100-mile 14-day rule. But, again, Pedocrats want the ""temporary"" status to be forever. We need to stop playing by their rules.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-19T22:11:12,-37

As opposed to them monitoring the tracking device/audio recorder/ video recorder/ communication device we all carry on us pretty much at all times that we know for a fact they look at?,chillthrowaways,2025-04-22T07:13:34,1
