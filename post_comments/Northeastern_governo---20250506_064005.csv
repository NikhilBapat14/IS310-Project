"Listen, just promise to give the Canadians a heads up about unusual troop deployments in their state and national guard activation orders from Washington.",steve_ample,2025-05-06T06:58:17,6
"Fuck Kelly Ayotte. Joyce Craig barely put up a fight during the last election, and it should have been a home run. She let all those thugs pin homelessness and the opioid epidemic on her, which, if you live in NH, I know that’s  been an issue for decades and has been exacerbated by Republicans.

New Hampshire is going to struggle considering where a lot of our tourism money comes from; Canada.",Skippypal,2025-05-06T11:50:00,2

Most likely our Canadian Security Intelligence Service (think FBI/CIA rolled into one) has already cracked Hegseth's Signal account so we should be okay on the heads up,biscuitarse,2025-05-06T07:50:42,7
