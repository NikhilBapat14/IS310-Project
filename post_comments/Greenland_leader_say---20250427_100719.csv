trump should write a book on how to turn fast allies against yourself.  It's his true calling.,tazebot,2025-04-27T10:24:29,21
"Trump has never been a ""deal maker."" It's all hype he has made up to make himself feel important. It wasn't as bad when it was just about his so-called business. But now, it's about the entire world. His narcissism is tearing democracy down, and everyone around him knows it. All it would take to put this rabid dog in its place is for Congress to grow a set of balls and use its power to stop him. They choose not to, and the hour is getting late and may be too late to act...I mean, hell, he is planning a third term, and Congress says nothing.   Germany didn't think what happened could happen either... Wake the Hell up!",SAJ-13,2025-04-27T10:35:01,15
"*""We will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by anyone, and that's the message I think is most important to understand,""  ""We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future,""*      Do they really think Trump cares what they say? Trump is a sociopath and doesn't understand boundaries.",SAJ-13,2025-04-27T10:11:57,9
I wouldn’t put it past Trump to use our troops to invade Greenland and take it by force.,hyborians,2025-04-27T10:17:24,4
When is it too far for the spineless GOP?,Strange-Ad420,2025-04-27T10:28:06,5
"What people need to understand is that Trump is timid, even fearful, when it comes to taking military action involving another country.  Sure, he will sick ICE on people in the United States and will have plenty of hot rhetoric.   But, I doubt he would have even had the nerve to get Osama bin Laden.  He won't take military action against Iran and he certainly won't take military action against Greenland.  There's plenty of bluff and fear in his personality.  He goes after easy targets like grabbing women's pu**ies.",dremonearm,2025-04-27T10:30:07,4
Trump IS disrespectful about anything and everything and everyone…unless they bend a knee to him.  He is a POS!,Alert_Damage_883,2025-04-27T11:33:52,3
Join the crowd. Almost everything he says is disrespectful or a flat out lie.,Ornery-Ticket834,2025-04-27T14:27:41,3
"I'm almost as mad at some of the weak responses to Trump as I am at Trump himself. Like bro, he threatened military invasion. That's not disrespect, it's an existential threat!!!",XIII_THIRTEEN,2025-04-27T15:24:59,3
True. And then some.,kneeco28,2025-04-27T10:11:59,2

"He’s not a deal maker, he’s a conman, a thief, a liar and an extortionist.           Trump is the kinda guy who sees you’re selling a car for $5000 and will steal your dog. Then when he comes to buy the car, he’ll offer you “This is piece of shit. Tell you what, give it to me for $500 and I’ll tell you where you can find your dog. I think I saw him somewhere? Brown dog? Has a collar that says ‘Billy’ or something? You like your dog?”",Artistic-Law-9567,2025-04-28T13:02:23,1
The world cares what he says. He’s not talking just to him. As a Canadian I’m happy to see leaders being CRYSTAL CLEAR it ain’t happening.,fronchfrays,2025-04-27T11:22:11,8
The days of conquering nations are over.  If they aren’t over there’s a WW3 that’ll happen over it.  Doesn’t matter what Trump thinks.  He’s not just going to invade another country and plant the USA flag without the world stepping in.    Rather than ask if he cares should be asking if we love our children enough we don’t want them dying for this cause.,hereforstories8,2025-04-27T11:48:36,5
They would really need to manufacture some bullshit to make it happen. Something like WMDs.,H0bbituary,2025-04-27T17:22:40,2
"When Trump starts targeting them, and not a moment before. And hell, the ones not being targeted will still support him.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-27T10:39:46,3
>  He won't take military action against Iran   Except he already did during his first term.   And don't forget that he increased drone strikes during his first term so much that he had double what Obama did in half the time.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-27T10:40:42,3
Trump is good at punching down like any bully going after people who can’t defend themselves but if it comes to actual direct conflict Trump always backs because like all bullies he is a gutless coward. It’s why his foreign policy is a mess because he surrounds himself with yes men who will try to make his insane ideas reality.,megaben20,2025-04-27T16:19:38,2
"Just look up Saddam Hussein's 1979 Ba'ath Party purge to see how that'd go. They'll be cheering ""long live Trump"" while their comrades are being led out of the House Chamber.",Pavlovsdong89,2025-04-27T12:34:10,3
Good point.  He's been known to use drone strikes.  But in general he's a weak commender in chief.  Obama used U.S. troops to get Osama bin Laden.,dremonearm,2025-04-27T10:57:29,1
