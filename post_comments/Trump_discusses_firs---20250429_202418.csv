*historically bad   Fuck ABC for normalizing this monster..¬†,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-29T20:36:23,27
"Policies aside, Trump is just such an *asshole.* Like I get you want the president of the nation to be confident and assured in his abilities but he was constantly going out of his way to insult the interviewer, ABC, and his enemies as a whole.  So fucking embarrassing",InvertedCobraRoll,2025-04-29T20:30:09,18
why interview him at this point? all he does is lie.,Asleepingin,2025-04-29T20:48:20,9
He doesn't just think the tattoos on Kilmar Abrego Garcia's knuckles are symbols.  He thinks the letters are tattooed on right above it.  What a dummy,KingThar,2025-04-29T20:43:50,8
He actually admitted that he had the power to bring back Abrego Garcia but doesn't want to and isn't going to. Should make for some interesting contempt hearings.,ptulinski,2025-04-29T21:15:21,8
"What. The. Ever. Loving. Fuck...  I am at a loss for words. How does this man get out of bed in the morning without accidentally choking on his own underwear or something? The way that he kept harping on the CLEARLY fake tattoos while the host was literally sitting there and begging him to take the out, but he just refused to let it go.  We have photographs... Actual fucking photographs of Abrego Garcia meeting with Van Hollen in el Salvador and the tattoos aren't there. How did some aid not immediately run into the room and beg him to stop? They just confessed to lying in front of the entire world, and there was factually no reason to do so. Why die on this hill? Why not just move on like the host so desperately wants to? It's like suicide bombing an uninhabited island.   This might be the single most stupid thing I've heard come of of his mouth and that is a very high bar to raise.",RyloKloon,2025-04-29T21:29:08,7
Sounds like the interview mostly consisted of him blowing himself,chrisscan456,2025-04-29T20:32:32,7
‚ÄúThey did sign up for it‚Äù is the type of statement that a decent resistance party would make him pay for politically.,ahdidi413,2025-04-29T20:34:38,5
I couldn‚Äôt watch. Way too much lying for one sitting.,posco12,2025-04-29T20:40:48,6
"More lies. CNN and others have already fact checked and debunked Donnie von Shitzinpants' statements about his 1st 100 days dragging in the US into his toilet!  Yes, he is FLOTUS!  (That's Fucking Loser of the United States!)",BioticVessel,2025-04-29T20:28:53,8
Lying his arse off as usual.,DaDibbel,2025-04-29T20:32:59,4

Anywhere to get the full interview? Not in snippets? Incredibly frustrating,Fair_Dingo_7078,2025-04-29T20:30:48,2
He‚Äôs tanking.,ShakeyLegsMcGee,2025-04-29T20:55:02,2
I could not stand this interview. I almost vomited from the constant lying and the ‚ÄúI am the best and everyone else is a yuge loser‚Äù attitude.  A scary part of this interview was when he was basically saying he can do whatever he wants regardless of whatever judge or supreme court says.,aegee14,2025-04-30T00:00:04,1
The fact that he couldn't get he got fed a photoshopped image blows my mind. People really are that fucking stupid.,Intelligent_Matter65,2025-04-30T00:00:18,1
Trump made ABC look so bad lol,marianoeugene,2025-04-30T01:49:21,1
"Maybe TL;DR, but hopefully not...  Interesting 100 days. For those out there who might be math curious, I did a linear regression analysis relating tRump's *Net Approval Rating* to the number of days he'd been in office - using a downloaded set of [Nate Silver's always well curated ratings](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin), based on polling averages he's maintained independently  since his time at 538. The *Net Approval Rating* is probably best described as **the percent who approve** **- the percent who disapprove**.  I found a rather stunning correlation of 0.94 (R^(2) = 0.94 - a measure of how closely the predictions of  the resulting ***regression equation*** match the actual data) out of the maximum possible 1.00 - which would indicate essentially a perfect fit of all the points analyzed to the resulting equation. Here is the equation which resulted:  Predicted Net Approval = 7.41% - (0.15% x Trump Days in Office, including golf days)  So, for example, on day 37 (arbitrarily chosen by me) the regression prediction of tRump's approval that day would be  >7.41 - (0.15 x 37) = 7.41 - 5.55 = 1.86% (predicted net positive approval)   The actual approval on day 37 was 0.85%   >For day 65,   7.41 -(0.15 x 65) = -2.34% (predicted net disapproval)   Actual approval on day 65 was -1.72%  >And, for day 99 (the last posted as of this morning),   7.41 -(0.15 x 100) = -7.44% (predicted net disapproval)   Actual approval on day 99 (yesterday) - 9.66%  Just for giggles, I wanted to see what tRump's approval would be at 200 days into his benevolent despotism... since the regression seems to pretty well reflect the actual approval numbers - at least within a percent or two.  >741 - (0.15 \* 200) = -22.6% (predicted net disapproval)  This seeming hopeful analysis presumes that the growing disapprovals of the odious regime will not get even worse for OrangeMan than the trend so far... so if you take any bets at all, you'd best up the point spread on the lower end.",phosdick,2025-04-30T09:23:22,1
"this whole video was insane, in one part Terry, the interviewer was kind of being an asshole, but he very much was asking real questions and wasn‚Äôt holding back on facts that are well known but throughout the video Trump kinda just kept pointing fingers back at Biden saying how incompetent and gross it was that we had him as a president and blah blah blah then going on to be boastful about himself for another two minutes straightüò≠üò≠üòÇ  and what‚Äôs even crazier that he almost started convincing me‚Ä¶i got scared but then he always ends up fucking up his facts so idk i get how people could get lost while listening to bro and end up thinking he‚Äôs genuinely a good guy",Sudden-Try1719,2025-04-30T14:11:21,1
I think he went after him fairly well. Have you seen the whole thing? Read the transcript? T rump looks pretty bad in it..,Yourmama18,2025-04-29T21:08:42,5
You need to watch it again. This interviewer actually called Trump out on some lies. Trump get pissed and acted out. This was not a soft ball interview. Props to this man for actually standing up for the truth against the rapist and chief.,Orposer,2025-04-30T00:56:22,3
Gotta keep demonstrating that the emperor has no clothes   Can't let him hide and tell everyone he's fully dressed,EvilLittleGoatBaaaa,2025-04-30T00:56:50,1
Someone handed it to him and he didn't think twice about it.,f33dback,2025-04-29T22:57:19,3
"Oh man it killed meeee. It seemed like he couldn‚Äôt accept that he may have been misinformed/someone knew something he didn‚Äôt and absolutely could not tolerate the interviewer correcting him. He refused to move on because he wanted the interviewer to just say ‚Äúokay you‚Äôre right.‚Äù He even said so which was so baffling to me. Something along the lines of, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just say I‚Äôm right‚Äù if I recall correctly! Like wow. And then typical bully behavior soon after that telling the interviewer he‚Äôs never even heard of him and his network is the worst fake news. Is this not textbook narcissism. I mean I‚Äôm not an expert but it really seemed like it.",justbigeyes,2025-04-30T16:05:31,1
Yeah but he was thinking of Putin.,Nach0Maker,2025-04-29T20:37:29,2
Did you watch the interview? He did not lol,Terinth,2025-04-30T11:55:16,2
"Read the headline... calling it ""historic"" makes it sound like a good thing. Tumultuous, unprecedented, controversial, train wreck... those would have all been acceptable alternatives.¬†",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-29T21:15:23,3
"Yeah the 500 paragraph transcript because the full video is hidden behind a pay wall, yet every FOX video glorifying him is uncut and free on YouTube.   ABC is complicit in preventing progress, they know damn well that the people they need to convince to distrust Trump won't be literate enough to read that or willing to sign up for a service to watch it.   ABC needs to make sure every Trump supporter who wants to watch a full video with some semblance of actual debate with the president is able to. Greedy bastards.",the-big-question,2025-04-30T01:30:17,2
Pompeii was historic but nobody would call it a good thing,scoonbug,2025-04-29T21:51:58,5
"Not really here to argue; we‚Äôre prolly aligned. I was fine with the headline, shocked by the video of it, and laugh raged at the transcript of it.",Yourmama18,2025-04-29T21:19:38,1
"Right, but in today's vernacular, historic tends to mean historically good, especially when referring to a person. You wouldn't call Hitler historic... you'd say something like infamous or notorious.¬†",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-29T22:14:12,2
