"I’ll save you a click:  The results released Friday show Trump with an approval rating of 42 percent, while 54 percent said they disapprove of his job performance, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.  Trump’s approval rating in the poll sits at just 29 percent with independents, who indicated they’re showing stiff resistance to many of his policies, siding more with Democrats in opposition than Republicans who still overwhelmingly back his administration.   Meanwhile, fewer than a third of independents said Trump understands the problems of people like them, and more than 60 percent said they view Trump as exceeding the powers granted to him.",ipilotete,2025-04-25T21:57:27,123
