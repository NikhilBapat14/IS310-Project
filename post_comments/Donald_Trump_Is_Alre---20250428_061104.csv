"Date; Dec 25, 2025, Chicago. ICE issues no knock warrants to capture Santa Clause. It was determined that Clause did not have proper immigration documentation. Clause was also charged with avoiding paying required tariffs per President Trump's executive orders. It's reported Mr Clause has been deported and is in route to Venezuela.",EmptyEstablishment78,2025-04-28T06:37:02,11
"For all their whining and complaining about the phrase ""Happy Holidays"" and Starbucks cup designs, it's ironic that it was the conservatives who ended up electing the man who would start the actual ""War on Christmas"". At least [one person](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9QVYpdL6o&pp=ygUoV2hvIGdpdmVzIGEgc2hpdCBhYm91dCBjaHJpc3RtYXMgbWVsYW5pYQ%3D%3D) will be very happy this holiday season...",LurksAroundHere,2025-04-28T06:32:03,2
"Definitely can vouch for this when I worked a short stretch selling to big box retailers in terms of planning for Christmas. In fact, there was planning for the post-black friday period, the 10 days prior to Christmas, and the week following Christmas. You didn't want to bank on having enough leftover stock for once block to do a sale and last-minute ads for the next block, so just stock up on new items to do specific sales for each. Deal with what's left over in one go later on.      Everything is pre-planned, and therefore the Grinch is already reserved and booked.",steve_ample,2025-04-28T06:58:02,2
