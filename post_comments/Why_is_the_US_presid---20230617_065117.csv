"First: in practice, it’s closer to what you want than you’d think. If the line of succession falls to Cabinet secretaries, they can be bumped by a Speaker of the House or a President pro tem of the Senate as soon as there’s someone eligible in either of those roles (3 U.S. Code § 19(d)(2)). If the Speaker and pro tem are killed and the Secretary of State becomes acting President, then as soon as there’s a new Speaker or a new pro tem, they become acting President instead. The Cabinet secretary just serves as a placeholder before one house of Congress picks a new leader. (At least in theory. The line of succession has never gone below VP, and the kind of chaos that would result in the Secretary of State taking over is also the kind of chaos where written rules might not be rigorously followed.)  Second: There’s a problem with putting elected officials in the line of succession. If the death of an official would mean they get replaced by someone with wildly different views, that can encourage assassinations. Even leaving aside assassinations, the President is elected for a 4-year term on a particular platform, and their death shouldn’t necessarily result in the opposite platform being implemented. There’ an argument that the Speaker and pro tem should *not* be in the line of succession for exactly this reason. Cabinet officials are basically aligned with the President’s goals, so if the office falls to them you wouldn’t expect as wild a shift in policy.  This becomes particularly obvious if you start to put minority party congressional leadership in the line of succession. In 2021, both houses of Congress and the Presidency were held by Democrats. Given that, it’d be weird to have Republicans in the line of succession. They weren’t elected nationally (McCarthy’s congressional district electing him doesn’t give him any sort of national mandate). The political party that chose them as its leaders did not have a majority. You could make a decent case that the Secretary of State back then had more of a democratic mandate than the House Minority Leader.",cpast,2023-06-17T09:44:28,20
"The line of succession is based on a law passed by congress.   It's not based on any of the reasons you mentioned.  Or anything other than the law passed by congress.  You might think it is bad or wrong, but congress doesn't.",unebaguette,2023-06-17T10:44:44,3
"Cabinet positions have to be approved by the senate, which means they're a little more than just unilaterally appointed by the president.",fixingthepast,2023-06-17T09:43:36,3
"Because Congress and the president have changed their minds several times.  When Congress was initially trying to come up with who would be inline after the P/VP, there was push back to the idea of congressional members being in succession at all, because that was not the original intent of those positions. The chief justice and the Sec of State were considered, but we eventually got the president pro tem and the Speaker, in that order.  In the 1880's we have to evoke the succession protocols, and realize how inadequate they are. We have multiple vacancies at the same time and Congress decides to move the line of succession to the cabinet to ensure elections (and constitutional concerns) didn't get in the way of having all seats filled. Cabinet members are in order of the founding of their agencies.  Later Truman asked for Congress to update the succession protocol, because he thought he shouldn't be able to pick his successor, and even the acting president should be elected. So we keep the cabinet members, but insert the congressional members in front of them, just in reverse order to what they were before.  There's debate if the last act was constitutional, as people refer back to original intent of not having congressional members in the line at all.",HTC864,2023-06-17T10:10:07,3
"On the other hand, maybe it shouldn’t be elected representatives in Congress at all.  Separation of powers is pretty central to our constitution, and it’s arguably unlawful to have the speaker or senate pro tem become president in the first place.  It’s also not a good idea for partisan control to change upon impeachment or infirmity, because it gives the presidents party an incentive to keep a corrupt or infirm president in office.  When the president was elected, the people chose that person to lead for four years, and if they can’t it should be someone they trust and agree with on most issues and who received a confirmation by the Senate.",ReElectNixon,2023-06-17T10:42:11,2
"Just to add (I feel others explained it pretty good) that it's actually controversial that the Speaker and President pro tempore are on the list. In the Consistitution, other then Vice President, left it up to Congress to decide which ""Federal officers"" would take over, and as members of Congress neither the Speaker or President pro tempore are officers of the Federal government. However, cabinet secretaries are.  Additionally, the President pro tempore of the Senate is more an honary position then a functional one. While the Speaker is the leader of the House and could reasonably be expected to have the skills to take over, the President pro tempore, however, is chosen based on seniority of the controlling party. Although the current holder is the second senior in the party, she has it because the senior most senator declined.",Shakezula84,2023-06-17T12:50:51,2
"The Senate Majority Leader isn’t actually mentioned explicitly in the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution calls for the president pro tempore to serve as the presiding officer when the Vice President isn’t present, though in practice neither the Vice President nor the president pro tempore preside over the Senate on a daily basic, making the Senate Majority Leader the de facto leader of the Senate.",Nikola_Turing,2023-06-17T16:49:37,1
"This is a tough issue. The bottom line is that just being like ""well he's elected isn't he"" doesn't really solve the problem because he was elected a *different* office. Lots of folks can get elected to represent Long Island and yet not get elected to be the President. So if we just ""go down the line"" of elected folks, eventually you get guys like Matt Gaetz or George Santos or Katie Hill (before she resigned) in the line of succession...and I think we can all agree that's a bad idea.  Also, making a line of succession hundreds of lines long only really matters in theory. The only times line of succession matters is in cases of unexpected death, and if we have to go through more than like 5 names, then there's a bigger problem here that will likely result in the collapse of the system anyway. Going out to that length is mostly a matter of checking boxes that will never actually apply.  But also keep in mind, the point of the president is to be the chief executive. The reason the *leaders* of the chambers are chosen is because their job includes managing a governing majority. The Speaker of the House is significant in a way the Minority Leader is not because the Speaker of the House has to set an agenda and wrangle majorities. Similarly, a cabinet head would generally be a more experienced person that could command executive authority if required, especially compared rank and file House members that often were just entry level folks getting into politics.  I mean, consider that the Framers saw Secretary of State as the prized jewel just behind the presidency. Early Secretary of States included men like Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and more. This was seen as an incredibly powerful and important position in the government. Though I think you could make a great case that this assumption, like some of the other assumptions of our Framers, hasn't held up perfectly well as history has gone on. Sec State is certainly a less prominent role than it was in the Framers' time. Hell, the line of succession was written before the EOP even existed!  You could make a pretty coherent case that it should be updated.",mormagils,2023-06-20T09:22:18,1
"According to CGP Grey, it's not clear if ""bumping"" would actually happen. As usual, it's one of those ""let the Supreme Court figure it out when it happens"" kinda things.",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-06-17T14:44:10,5

"The statute they cited says as much.  ""(c)An individual acting as President under subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section shall continue to act until the expiration of the then current Presidential term, except that—   (1)if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded in whole or in part on the failure of both the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect to qualify, then he shall act only until a President or Vice President qualifies; and   (2)if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded in whole or in part on the inability of the President or Vice President, then he shall act only until the removal of the disability of one of such individuals.""  I'm not sure why they'd have the correct statute and still get this wrong, especially considering it's a short read.",Ent3rpris3,2023-06-18T23:18:59,1
"“An individual acting as President **under subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section** […]” Subsections (a) and (b) are the Speaker and the president pro tem of the Senate. Cabinet secretaries are subsection (d), and (d)(2) says:  > (2) An individual acting as President under this subsection shall continue so to do until the expiration of the then current Presidential term, **but not after a qualified and prior-entitled individual is able to act,** except that the removal of the disability of an individual higher on the list contained in paragraph (1) of this subsection or the ability to qualify on the part of an individual higher on such list shall not terminate his service.  “I'm not sure why they'd have the correct statute and still get this wrong, especially considering it's a short read.” —It is a short read, I cited the relevant subsection, before being snarky please make sure you actually *have* read it and checked that the subsection you’re citing is relevant.",cpast,2023-06-18T23:32:15,1
