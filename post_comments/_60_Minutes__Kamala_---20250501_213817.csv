"""What the fuck did I just read?"" - Babylon Bee",H3nchman_24,2025-05-02T00:18:15,79
This is actually pretty sad. Like who are they fooling. Openly admitting the Emmy‚Äôs are irrelevant. Traditional media cannot die fast enough. Good riddance.,McArsekicker,2025-05-02T00:25:13,43

"Man, Babylon Bee, you almost got me agai...oh.¬†   Between the WHCA photo of the year and this, it's like the media industry is absolutely insistent on pissing on the charred remnants of their reputations in their latest infantile attempt at resisting this administration.

"Remember the type of people that run and vote in these awards. They're the same type of people that gave Dan Rather an award for journalism after he peddled painfully obvious fake documents. ""Journalism"" doesn't matter one whit. What matters is pushing the party agenda.",ngoni,2025-05-02T05:51:54,36
Democrats just LOVE giving themselves awards.  A certain Barack Obama got a Nobel Peace Prize less than a year into his presidency which was bullshit then and is still bullshit today.,TedriccoJones,2025-05-02T06:09:05,16
