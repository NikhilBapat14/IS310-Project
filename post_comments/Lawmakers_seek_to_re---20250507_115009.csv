"Reddit seems to be pro-ballot initiatives, but have a look at 2008 California Proposition 8.  Which won.  It had to be overturned by the legislature.",box-cable,2025-05-07T12:01:55,1
> A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them.   what's wrong with this?,box-cable,2025-05-07T12:00:25,0
"No system is perfect, but i would rather have more of a direct democracy than to continue to operate according to outdated, elitist and classist assumptions about governance. Not to mention that it seems like things worked out okay in california. ",Bakedads,2025-05-07T12:22:34,3
Prop 8 was supported by outsiders Koch bros and Utah mormons who wrote up a confusing prop to just to win.,SeductiveSunday,2025-05-07T13:23:56,3
"Ballot initiatives are an important check against the party in power. Yes, they're often used by the minority party to pass legislation that they couldn't get through otherwise, but its a more democratic process than choosing our representatives is. In my state we've used it to repeatedly raise minimum wage, cap medical debt, decriminalize marijuana, incentivize solar energy, and protect abortion access.",Hunter5024,2025-05-08T23:18:39,1
As an Arkansas I can verify that this is mostly bullshit. The state GOP has been on a crusade to destroy ballot initiatives for years in response to the public voting to allow medical marijuana. This is just another attempt at finding ways to nullify public involvement in state government. I assure you that they DO NOT have the public well being in mind.,Whateverman1977,2025-05-07T12:20:21,3

Ballot initiatives isn't nearly as bad as California's recall rules. That's what should be addressed first. The overwhelming majority of California's recalls time and money wasters. Not to mention just ridiculously and completely irrationally promoted by Republicans.,SeductiveSunday,2025-05-07T14:20:49,2
"I have yet to see how selling marijuana has caused harm to the public. Even if it does, that doesn’t explain why our state legislators Don’t bring that information to the public and let us decide. Personally, I’ve had a medical marijuana card for five years now, and it has greatly increased my quality of life. I haven’t taken a pain pill or any other kind of medication. I feel better, I’m more mobile, and I’m not spending thousands of dollars on medication that was doing more harm than good.",Whateverman1977,2025-05-07T12:40:04,3
