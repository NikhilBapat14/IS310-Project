">Frank Davis saw a lot of waste during his decades in the federal government. In November, he voted for Donald Trump to get rid of it. So far, Davis likes a lot of what he has seen.  Probably worth noting that this administration hasn't cut many costs if any at all. The Trump administration has spend more than $200 billion more overt he past 3 months than the Biden administration did last year in this time frame (and something that is only projected to get worse).  So no, these people don't ""like a lot of what \[they have\] seen,"" they just like to be lied to with not an ounce of critical thought about what they see while the admin does the opposite of what it ""promised"". And those quotes are doing \*very\* heavy lifting here.",Its-A-Spider,2025-05-06T03:01:55,19

"That’s what happens when people vote for cost cutting without thinking about what actually gets cut. It always sounds good until it’s your town losing services or jobs. Politicians never say what the real consequences will be, just that it’ll save money.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-06T05:14:32,5

Oh so hurting other people is fine (weird take for a firefighter) but when it affects you then it’s a problem. You see this is why we are a joke to the rest of the world and nobody should trust us because our voting base would rather have an insurrectionist 2x impeached criminal than a woman president. Yes I realize she was not the best pick and had to work with little time to have a proper campaign but it should’ve been clear when he said out loud “they’re eating the cats they’re eating the dawgs….they’re eating the pets”. Howard Dean lost his campaign for President because he got a little too enthusiastic at a rally😂Look it up if you’re a youngling it’s pretty ridiculous,DadBreath12,2025-05-06T09:40:46,2

That and they see all spending as waste unless it betters there lives. Farmers love handouts and programs that help them but programs or grants helping other groups is always wasteful spending.,sedatedlife,2025-05-06T03:26:26,22

"... which is in a state that gave its electoral votes to Harris, currently has 2 Democratic senators, and has 6/7 Democratic representatives (including the district that Emmitsburg is in).   So this one guy's vote didn't actually do anything to help put Trump in power, and his gradual loss of faith in Trump won't change anything next election. All we can hope for is that his story is being repeated in more purple states/districts, so that we have a shot at ending this nightmare sooner rather than later.",nudave,2025-05-06T11:00:05,1
