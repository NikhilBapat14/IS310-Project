"And not a peep about alliances between Russia and North Korea.  Russia and North Korea have strengthened their relations significantly, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This includes military cooperation, with North Korea providing military assistance to Russia and both countries signing a mutual defense treaty in 2024.",RodeoSex,2025-05-05T01:56:59,3

"Response from the Chinese Embassy in the UK:   [https://x.com/ChineseEmbinUK/status/1919314367981473862](https://x.com/ChineseEmbinUK/status/1919314367981473862)  Peter Narvaro is nothing but an economic war-mongerer with a distorted mindset on international trade.       This new round of US trade bullying is a real wakeup call to all countries including its allies. If not stopped, Peter Navaro and the like will definitely want to turn America into a vampire to suck the blood of the  UK and all other countries. We must not allow that to happen.       This is a dangerous time for the world. We must face it and resist it. Appeasement is no option for protectionism and bullying.",bjran8888,2025-05-05T06:02:17,1

"Well.  Back when we HAD a CDC, they counted about 3,000 AMERICAN deaths from food poisoning every year.  Frankly, now they've also gutted the FDA, and the few FDA that remain are in a building with LEGIONELLA-contaminated tap water, I wouldn't recommend ANY country import US products failing to meet their safety standards.   You can do better.  I mean, think about it: How in the hell can FDA be responsible to test food safety, in a work setting exposed to Legionella (an airborne risk)?  Oh and Trump banned telework so ... that's how they'll be livin'   DON'T FORGET how many times Mar a Lago has been cited for food safety violations!  That's probably why Diaperman was so keen to get rid of the FDA and inspectors.  Trump won't be making anything safer I guarantee you that.  Rage?  Let 'em have it. Food Imports?
