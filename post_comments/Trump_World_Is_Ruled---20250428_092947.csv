"**This is literally Project 2025**  The whole fucking purpose of this is so that nothing is retained.  Every illegal decision is automatically deleted after a little bit of time.  While P2025 didn't specifically say ""use signal!"", [as something like Snopes would call out](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/signal-project-2025/) \- this is really nothing more than distinction without a difference, as it did absolutely instruct the administration to use means of communication that did not leave a paper trail, and [Signal was absolutely mentioned as an option](https://www.newsweek.com/signal-project-2025-trump-administration-backlash-2051621).",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-28T09:52:18,92
"We shouldn’t even assume Trump has a handle on any of this. We basically have a shadow presidency made up of little groups operating as little fiefdoms. Makes Trump look super impotent, not like the cult cares though.",alien88,2025-04-28T09:33:12,62
">A sprawling network of Signal group chats involving hundreds of top business executives, Silicon Valley leaders, and journalists, as well as legal and economic analysts, has massively reshaped national politics since the pandemic—in large part thanks to the platform’s disappearing message function.  >“Group chats are now where everything important and interesting happens,” Substack author Noah Smith wrote.  >Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the tech venture capitalist firm a16z and one-time co-author of Mosaic, an early version of the internet, spends “half his life on 100” of these sorts of group chats at a time, one anonymous participant hyperbolized to Semafor’s Ben Smith.",thenewrepublic,2025-04-28T09:30:13,23

Duh.  Someone needs to sue Signal to tell them to retain the chats. Government records are public record.  Signal then needs to sue the US Government for putting government records on a server that deletes itself.,NolChannel,2025-04-28T09:42:06,10

I get the impression it’s the Stephen millers and Voughts and Hegseths actually making the evil decisions. The “king” just likes to golf and play with tariffs. He signs anything they put in front of him.,ioncloud9,2025-04-29T05:28:33,1

"Which doesn’t make sense. They use money and privilege to keep the “riff-raff” out of private clubs, but these group chats are 1000 times more exploitable. Who knows when one of the participants has been compromised and is being impersonated? How could anyone, in any of these chats, think the parties are who they say they are? Especially when there’s already been randomly added people, and no one noticed, and we keep hearing more and more and more about these chats. They really think all of these chats are safe? At least in private spaces they have a certain level of physical security to the premises, and an app on a phone doesn’t have any of that. Anyone from random Joe citizen to president Peng of the Penguins Democratic Republic could be spoofing numbers and trying to gain access to extremely sensitive information.",RttnAttorney,2025-04-28T10:06:50,6
"Like I get your rage here but signal messages are end to end encrypted. They can turn over who’s in what groups with whom, and long the conversation is but that’s literally it.  So what do you do shut down signal for enabling them? The actual elites just rebuild it from source and shmucks don’t get to play ",Just-Hedgehog-Days,2025-04-28T10:16:48,6

"Isn't that sort of antithetical to Signal's business model? It's not Signal's fault the DOD unlawfully used it, but forcing Signal to turn over what it markets itself to protect would open up that jurisdiction to liability from Signal. It also would be a deathknell for Signal.  Instead they should consider the signal chats as containing classified info and proceed that way. What was done was illegal regardless of the contents of the chats, or where the chats happened.",ZedZeno,2025-04-28T10:05:16,1

"I don't think they particularly care, and I think you're underestimating the dopamine hit of being able to talk to anyone at any time. It's likely the same reason reddit and social media at large can be addicting, and these folks are melting their brans in a soup with people like Chris Rufo who's entire premise is wearing a bright red sash around his chest that says ""bad faith actor.""",Areyounobody__Too,2025-04-28T10:12:45,5
"That's the ploy.  You sue Signal to ban the users and Signal sues the US for misusing the TOS. In the lawsuit, all phones are seized and login info is demanded.",NolChannel,2025-04-28T10:22:53,1
"I totally agree. They really just can’t help themselves. But this is why the government has specifically available secure networks, and they could get their dopamine hit from that instant communication anyways. This is so they can let outsiders in on making plans without oversight and vetting. That’s why it’s just amazingly dumbfounding to me that they think they can’t be infiltrated.  “Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, their incompetence may be our only hope. If not our complete destruction.”",RttnAttorney,2025-04-28T10:35:03,2
