"The political argument to make right now:  Trump has said that, to make the new tariffs work, there will be some suffering. So, let's postpone all tax cuts until the tariffs start working and we see supply chains moving to the US.",Animats,2025-04-05T09:40:47,237

"The Republicans will only own all of the negative repercussions if the Democrats persuasively  communicate this to voters now and in the future. And that doesn’t necessarily mean logic and reasoning.   Whatever else you may think of Republicans, they’ve been winning the narrative war for the past twenty-five years (with a short-lived blip in 2008).   Yes, they have Fox News, which serves ostensibly as a wing of the Republican Party, but more than that they are shameless in their Janus-faced style of blaming the Dems for everything. They take no prisoners with their narrative, and it works for enough of the electorate to give them victories.   Meanwhile…  …the Dems continue to wear gloves while the Republicans wield brass knuckles. Dems can be very right all day on policies, but only election results truly matter.   In the end, elections are won by emotions - not ideas. Trump proved this twice with his fiery word salads, even to the point of having Republicans vote against their own self-interests and belief systems.   The Dems must first do what it takes to win elections and then work to implement their ideas for a fairer and more just society.  Playing fair only works when the opponents acknowledge and agree to the rules. The Republicans have burned the rules book altogether.",[deleted],2025-04-05T11:27:02,15

"It doesn't matter that they own it. The precedent is over. There are no more norms. They don't care that they own it! They don't care that it will bankrupt the poor, give more to the powerful to the rich. They don't care that you are making this stupid video saying you tried to win using the same process that's failed time and time again.   That fact is you did nothing to break from the norms, to save democracy. Did you light the bill on fire? Did you block the house chamber so no one could enter? Did you push the speaker aside IN THE FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY! NO. Failures, all of them.  I was at the Capitol today in Utah. I was fighting for the democracy of all.
