This was news 15 years ago. Now the division they are trying to sow in Europe and the US are well-documented. Brexit was the wake-up call.,rmvandink,2025-05-10T13:38:31,1

They really just need to publish the laws for Republican voters and the laws for Democrats already! That way people wouldn't be getting arrested for doing things like following laws and could properly mitigate their legal risk to these shadow laws that the public has no clue exist and the laws that don't really exist that apply to only certain groups of non-MAGA people.,postsshortcomments,2025-05-10T15:17:04,1

"They literally have a book they're following, and in it everything is laid out  Foundations of Geopolitics  -   >Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"" to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".",OpenThePlugBag,2025-05-10T13:55:47,1

What is “wokism” exactly? When I see it in context it appears to me that it is used to discredit marginalized groups from pushing back against oppressive ideologies.,U_Peaky_Panish,2025-05-10T14:40:06,1
"I looked it up and to me it seems that “Wokism” is neither a left, nor a right exclusive term, but rather one used by authoritarian governments. Authoritarian governments want full control of society, so when society goes against what the government gate keeps as “acceptable” they feel vulnerable and weak. If “wokism” means giving black people, minorities, and women the right to vote, are we saying that is “bad” because it doesn’t conform to mainstream values of that time?  I have two young kids that I’m homeschooling but I would not label folks who are trying to live the only life they have in a way that makes them happy as “woke”. Whether it’s being transgender, gay, straight, religious, atheist, etc. it is the responsibility of the parents to inform their children on the diversity that exist in the planet, I believe, in a way that does not shield the child. In conclusion, wokism to me is an authoritarian term used by those who wish to take full control of peoples lives. Just my two cents.",U_Peaky_Panish,2025-05-10T14:55:57,1
