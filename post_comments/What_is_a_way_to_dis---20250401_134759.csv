"The only way is when people see each other as people first, and then look at their particular attributes, like race, color, sex, age, religion, etc.  This will probably take a very long time from what I can see.",billpalto,2025-04-03T15:25:59,5
"Dismantle ignorance that the racism stems from for a majority of people, address inequalities between the two people groups, uplift both groups so that one side doesn’t feel like it’s being disfavored over the other. These reforms would induce a neutral-positive attitude, but future reforms would be needed to make truly positive inroads.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-03T09:24:44,6
"Tribalism is an innate, natural-born animalistic instinct of ours as a species, so it's altogether impossible to eradicate, only somewhat alleviate and mitigate under social constructs; therefore, yours is no more than a quixotically fanciful chimera.",NoExcuses1984,2025-04-03T21:37:19,3

"A leader cannot make racism disappear, but the universe can by: (1) creating a conflict that unites all people of the planet; apocalyptic  (2) occult governance  (3) technology that allows everyone to choose their own form",already-redacted,2025-04-02T20:41:19,3
"Racism can't be dismantled when it has morphed into systemic racism.   Jim-Crow style racist, overt prohibitions like separate bathrooms, can be dismantled.   Many people disagree with the concept of systemic racism.",Adeptobserver1,2025-04-02T23:47:24,3
"You start with race and then switch to nationality. These are two distinct things. Which are you asking about?  To answer the question about racism, you can’t eliminate it completely. The best way to minimize it is through peer pressure. You can’t really ban racism because it’s an idea, a thought. Attempting to ban it simply drives it underground where you can’t see it and deal with it directly.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-03T08:52:56,1

"Depends what you mean by racism.  Racism, is in essence, an overwhelming dislike of something different to you.  It's not a table you can pull the legs off and burn, it's not a wardrobe that you can remove the screws from and take down. There's a reason tribalism is found in every culture across the planet.  Systemic racism, though? Still not a wardrobe, but it do parts and pieces to it that you *can* take out until it collapses.",jeffjefforson,2025-04-03T09:57:23,1

"i’m gonna be real, it isn’t possible. People r excessively prideful, they always will be. They used to hate Italians cause they were “dark white”, even if only white people were left and had blue eyes and blonde hair, if someone had slightly dirty blonde hair they’d be considered less.",Status_Cheek_9564,2025-04-03T20:27:31,1

"Start from scratch!!!  I use to think when my grandparents generation died off it would get better… as I got older I thought maybe when my parents generation died off it would get better and then… I would say, I’m not sure if it would get better by the time my son’s generation died off… and now I’m wondering if by the time my grandkids….  Point is, I honestly don’t know if racism will ever die out and this offers little hope and that is truly unfortunate! Look how hateful people, regardless the color are to each other these days…    Here’s an encounter I had the other day at Walmart… I was walking towards the store and there was an older couple with 3 kids/grandkids with 2 carts with some kind of kids seat in each one. I asked them if they could use a hand since the boxes were of some size (and weight as I found out), initially they said “no thanks” but he was a older gentleman so I smiled and said “please, let me get this” as I grabbed the box and placed it in the truck… the lady said thanks and they would get the other… I looked at her and said “yeah, rightttt” and smiled grabbing the 2nd… I grabbed both carts , put them together and was taking them back to the store and the lady said “thank you… I’m not use to people being helpful!” Gave her a smile, winked to the gentleman, and smiled to the kids… and off I went.  Now being friendly or helpful is part of my dna… my dad beat it into me at a young age… lol but it’s also my best attribute and something I taught my son as well. Always say please, open doors for others (regardless the gender) and thank you… Now I know this got a bit off topic BUT maybe not… IF people would just be “thoughtful” and and treat people with respect, we wouldn’t be talking about racism…!  Now I’m pretty serious about starting from scratch because it is a learned trait (if that is the right word) from either the parents or friends who learned from their parents.  Just my 2 cents, respectfully, Lee",LeeS121,2025-04-08T01:24:34,1
"Education, integration and no blurry lines. DEI had the opposite impact because it forced people to see the difference by race when it should have been by economic status instead. This does not apply to other countries which are blatantly way more racist like Asian countries, latin America and EU.",lassiz95,2025-04-03T09:18:45,0
"Nope, you could induce laws if you like, but all you're going to do is internalize racism. Which people will try to justify their racist point of view anyhow.  I say this as a POC FWIW",Lost-Actuary-2395,2025-04-03T08:38:11,0

"I think a good way to eliminate it over time is to have interracial marriages be a standard, but you can't tell people who to love either, so a bit hard.",Pale-Candidate8860,2025-04-04T01:17:38,0
"You can not dismantle racism by using Reverse Racism. One does not cancel out the other. To quote somebody I never thought that I would quote, Oprah Winfrey once said we'll just have to wait for them to die. However, what do we do with what is passed on through family and culture? In the meantime, is racism in this country as bad as it's being made out to sound? We have come a long way, and we have gotten so much better than where we were, let's say, like in the 50s. We will just have to continue to keep getting better and better.   It will be a slow process, but it won't be helped when we have Reverse Racism being stoked at every turn through the media, politicians, high profile figures and interest groups.",Butty_Hack_it,2025-04-03T10:46:20,-1

"DEI only had that impact because Black and Brown people were so obviously excluded. The people who were always against integrating black and brown people to positions, pivoted to class once black and brown people were required to have the same amount of access. People seem to forget that even if you were a wealthy black person, you still didn't have access to the same things that wealthy white people had at the time.",Mztmarie93,2025-04-03T10:18:34,5
"I think we’re the MOST racist country ! No other country had separate but equal which wasn’t brought to the Supreme Court till the sixties. I can remember seeing colored only in the buses of the Deep South. No other country was so blatant.
