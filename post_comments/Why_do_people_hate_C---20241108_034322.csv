"People don't usually hate Christianity specifically, they hate religion in general, Christianity is just the big one in the English speaking world so it gets the attention.   And the why is pretty much everything you listed.",Maladal,2024-11-08T11:53:46,13
"I'm thinking maybe you only hear about people hating Christianity and catholism more because it is more popular in English speaking countries.  Many Americans don't even know what Islam is.  And all of those things you listed, yes, we hate it for all of those reasons and more.  And if we are acquainted with the other major organized religions, many of us hate them too.  Personally I don't think I hate one religion more than another, but I am more familiar with Christianity because it's the dominant religion where I live.  So... I guess I don't really understand why you're confused.  You provided a good list of reasons to hate it.",Round_Skill8057,2024-11-08T11:58:14,6
"So there are smarter people in the world who can give a more detailed answer but here is a quick TL;DR  Christianity is the dominant religion in America. Sure, we have other religions like Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc. and even no religion at all but in reality, none of these groups have any real power in the country.   The American government is supposed to be neutral towards religion. It is supposed to respect and protect people's right to practice their religion but it can't promote one religion over another.   Since about the 1980s, Evangelicals have been trying to make their religion the law of the land. If their religion says something is wrong then they want laws to exist that ban it for every single citizen.   Religion is supposed to be personal. If you believe that it is wrong to eat pork then good for you, don't eat pork. You shouldn't push for laws that would require everyone to give up pork.   This is why there is a lot of pushback. Most people would agree that you have a personal right to practice or not practice a religion and are fine with that. They get upset when you try to make your religion the law of the land.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-08T12:12:42,4

Christianity tends to put itself front and center in America so it takes a lot of the heat and the Evangelical movement (although not generally associated with Catholicism) is wrapped up in some pretty anti-Freedom political causes so it helps give the entire a religion a bad rep to people who don’t care to engage in nuance.,MTBadtoss,2024-11-08T12:37:29,2
"Most people that are against Christian religion, would be against the other religions too. They might mention Christianity because it's the one in their environment and the one that is forced on them by family, neighbours, or whoever. I grew up in a catholic country and the feeling against Catholicism was just because it was what people were exposed to. The feeling would be extended to the others if they had been exposed to them.",LeyreBilbo,2024-11-08T13:20:15,1
"People have negative opinions about things that negatively affect their lives personally or the lives of people they know. There is more criticism of Christianity because it is more common to experience Christianity particularly in Western, English speaking countries.   If you can understand the bad things the Church has done, then it should be easy to see why folks don't like the Church. It's not petty or random. It's related directly to experiences the Church has had with people.",mormagils,2024-11-08T17:05:19,1
I don't think people hate Christianity or Catholicism. I think it's more of a thing that people just don't like religion. Especially oppressive religions. Just so happens fundamentalist Christianity falls in there along with fundamentalist Islam.  It's all garbage meant to keep people under a giant thumb.,keef_boxxx,2024-11-08T19:31:55,1
I don't. Hate religion.  My 2nd choice was to go into seminary.    I chose PCs instead.   Part of the reason is I question everything. Including everything the Bible says  People use it for their hate towards any person or thing that makes them feel off.   Someone identified a certain way. Let's treat them like garbage.,Throwawaygeekster,2024-11-08T19:55:19,1
"Because religion is just a tool used by the powerful to control the masses.  christians try to shove their religious beliefs down everyone's throats and then use the bible to justify passing religious-based laws.   Name an entity that has more blood on its hands than the catholic church, I’ll wait.    god is not real.",Moxman73,2024-11-08T20:19:02,1
"The popular sentiment among Christians—evangelicals in particular—is that they’re hated. The evidence put forward for this is specious at best, but it supports the victim narrative so that’s all that matters.   Secular people want to have a secular government that is agnostic at best towards religious expression. Those secular people do not want laws based on interpretations of scripture, especially when such laws are targeted at specific subgroups. I have no problem with Christians or any faith communities. I refuse to be subject to Christian Nationalism.",AllTheRoadRunning,2024-11-08T20:35:27,1

"They believe everyone should believe, think and feel the way they do. They can’t accept that there are other religions and other views. They’re extremely narrow minded. The church itself is money hungry. They also get involved in politics while not paying any taxes. Any church that puts out a political sign it gives sermons on who to vote for should pay taxes.",IllPhilosophy598,2024-11-10T13:24:45,1
"For many people it's not really about ""hate,"" it's about about religious beliefs being extended to policy and used as an excuse to oppress others.  If 150 million other people believed in a God of Microwaved Burritos, started a religion and then voted in laws based on it which affected you and your family directly, I imagine you might have a problem with it. Perhaps backers of this religion insist that your marriage should be illegal since you both have brown eyes. Or that certain forms of health care should be outlawed, or want matters of science that disagree with them removed from textbooks.  You might feel that's not fair as you don't even believe in a God of Microwaved Burritos, and think it's a silly idea in the first place. If so then you'll get it.",RedBankWatcher,2024-11-10T15:24:21,1
"TW: Slavery, Abuse   I found I could no longer be part of an organized religion due to Christianity’s  long and harmful history.   First for me is that they actively disagree with Jewish scholars on some things and issues. The people who have been studying their own culture and history.  That personally makes no sense to me. The religion seems to be based on what Jewish people got wrong. Not a fan of   Historical things like the Slave Bible and the Doctrine of Discovery. Religious leaders using their power over how the Bible is interpreted to subjugate others. Did you know there are records of children being kidnapped from Africa and “tithed” to the Catholic Church? Abortion only became a political issue in the US because of Christian organizations not wanting to desegregate. Gay men have been physically and emotionally hurt and this was encouraged by the church at large. Women have been stoned to death for “witchcraft” aka doing things differently or following a different religion.    And perhaps most organizations, religious or not, have misstepped or misinterpreted or generated human rights violations. You could argue that. I am no better a person than the next, I’ve said things, done things, and hurt people. We’re all bad. I get it. But there has been no repentance. No public acknowledgment of these horrors and many people prefer to ignore them, create a mythology of their own exceptionalism.   “Unsetting Truths” - Mark Charles  “The Making of Biblical Womanhood” - Beth Alison Barr  “Jesus and John Wayne” - Kristin Kobes du Mez “Paul and Gender” - Cynthia Long Westfall  Any book or talk by Rob Bell, Kathy Baldock, Jonathan Wilson Hartgrove and Richard Rohr.",Typical_Big_5803,2024-11-11T11:18:05,1
"Because they haven't yet progressed to hating ALL religion. Give it time.  Now that the evangelicals are all in on a fascist theocracy, I suspect atheism or agnosticism will ride in on a bullet train in the US.",wired_ronin,2024-11-11T17:19:01,1
"Not to be too terribly flippant... its because Christians, in the eyes of many, is ""white"" and, to be blunt, Christians don't kill people for insulting their religion.  Like you've said, Christianity has be used to motivate dark things in the past, like every other religion with that much history.  Almost anything you can lob at Christians, you can lob at Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.  But of the three main religions in the West (Christianity, Islam, Judaism), only Islam has not abandoned its more violent tendencies.    Even worse, it has a growing number - I'll use the term Islamist - want to take it even further.  These are those theocracies we see in the Iran, Afghanistan, ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah et al.  Whether fair or not, they soak up all the oxygen when there are countervoices within their religion.  Those other voices are starting to gain ground and its my sincere hope that those voices eventually win.  But Christians?  For the most part, you can't find many violent ones.  They are out there, for sure, but they're the exception rather than the norm.  And since most Christians don't want to *kill* people that insult their religion (in fact, many put those insults on display!  Piss Christ, for example), its easier to hate on them.  Its why many joke for members of ""Gays for Islam/Palestine/etc"" to actually go there, declare their sexuality, and see what happens.  Its mostly a joke because we don't want them to *die.*",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-08T11:53:45,1
"People don't understand how religions work. They think that religions shape the thinking and behavior of a civilization and don't realize that is the other way around. The primal spirit of a civilization sprouts religions that fit that model. Christianity started as a reflection of a new way of thinking in the middle east, then when they exported it to Europe it had to adjust to a new European way of thinking. People often think that the end of Christianity in Europe is what gave a path forward to the new liberal ideas and way of living, but the reality is that those ideas are just a continuation of Christianity which in turn is a continuation of the original European spirit. Young people hate Christianity simply because is the easiest target being in such a weak state. They don't date insult islam because they now there could actually be consequences for this unfortunately",hellracer2007,2024-11-08T11:24:35,-1

"I like your thoughts so I just wanted to reply my own as well.  Nobody hates Christianity. And with no disrespect I don’t understand why you feel like a victim? Nobody is condoning killing either.   But I’m going to try to take a political stance instead of a religious stance.   A11 of Treaty of Tripoli: “The government of the United States of America is not any sense founded on the Christian Religion.”  America is founded on liberty & justice for all and somewhere down the line we lost this.  Fun fact: “Under God” was added into the Pledge in 1954 under Eisenhower to distinguish us against communist countries.   Just to let you know how intertwined conservative politics have become…  the Catholic Church or Pope Francis has sought to discipline Catholic politicians like Joe Biden for taking a pro choice approach.   [Pure anecdotal but it is funny the man who actually practices his faith is hated and the man who isn’t know for religion is beloved by that community but this is America you have choice and that’s what makes it great]  As a society our founders chose to not allow it in our public dominions to allow people with the freedom to practice their faith and here is the kicker… it stems from their experience of religious persecution in Europe.   Separation from church & state is important for the survival of the United States.  Fun fact: Justin Jefferson owned a Quran.   Here’s more for you…  In 1974 there was a bombing at an elementary school in West Virginia because the school board, primarily Alice Moore, banned certain books and sought to introduce multiethnic and cultural content.  And individuals of the community believed they conflicted with Christian values and patriotism.   (How patriotism became synonymous with Christianity is another story)  Anyways they protested alongside with the KKK. Sounds like another group that likes to protest with the KKK.   Btw the bomber was a reverend by the name of Marvin Horan. Most sensible people would call this domestic terrorism… but guess what.  The same people behind Project 2025… the Heritage Foundation, saw it as patriotism and were kind enough to help him with any legal issues.  Idk what side of history you prefer to be on… but I’d rather distance myself from you know the KKk & elementary school bombers.  If you don’t know what a think bank is I encourage you to learn about them and how they may influence you and your thoughts.   And what I ultimately mean by this… actually get out and meet people that are different than you.   Anyways why I brought that up… today in many red states such as Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.. they are allowing kids to speak the 10 commandments, chaplains to replace counselors, banning certain books. Florida has even gone far enough to allow PragerU in classrooms?   Just watch Candace Owen’s PragerU on slavery and let me know your thoughts.  I may go deeper into this but to summarize: nobody hates Christianity but Christianity has become a symbol of patriotism when it’s not. Learn about how think banks may be influencing your own thoughts. Keep your faith but also be a freethinker.  I may make a post about the Reagan & Trump administration similarities and the influence of think banks in our politics.",rajujutsu,2024-11-11T02:29:21,1

"But why is Christianity universally mocked and made fun of then? Depictions of sacred Christian/Catholic acts are twisted to offend. I'm thinking of the recent dorito Eucharist video that Gov. Whitmer posted just a few weeks ago. And the mocking of the depiction of the last supper at the Olympics. There are other examples of this and it seems that it is socially acceptable to mock or be offensive to that religion instead of other religions, it is unthinkable in this day and age to make fun of other religions the way that people make fun of Christianity.

"I think it has something to do with punching up/punching down. The stereotype is the Christians are humorless martinets who demand slavish adherence from those around them *regardless of religiosity*. Think about the various uproars pushed by conservative media over the past 20 years:  * Saying 'happy holidays' is declaring war on Christmas, and thus on God  * Gay marriage is killing traditional families  *  Obama is a secret Muslim  * 10 commandments in the classroom/courtroom/etc.  * Separation of church and state is a sin  Note that most of these complaints involve requiring non-Christians to submit to the wills and preferences of Christians. That's an inherently authoritarian stance that's being pushed by a group that--combined--makes up roughly a quarter of the U.S. population. If you restrict the definition of ""Christian"" to white evangelical (who tend to be the loudest voices in the examples I provided), the percentage is even smaller: PRRI puts it at 14%.  That said, those 14% (or whatever number you're more comfortable with) are disproportionately represented in power structures. Making fun of their ceremonies, more extreme positions, etc. is a way to punch up. We can't attack power structures directly, but we can mock the beliefs of those who inhabit them. In the U.S., that takes the form about jokes touching on religion and religious practices. In Europe, it takes the form of making fun of fat, dumb Americans.  Among evangelical Christians it takes a different form. There's no punching up among that group, because by and large they see themselves as the only ""real"" Americans, the inheritors of the Shining City on the Hill ordained by God to rule over all they survey. People with that mindset can only punch down. Marginalized groups (gays, trans, immigrants, etc.) provide perfect targets. That's not even addressing how the behaviors of these ""righteous"" Christians violate the terms and expectations of their own faith.",AllTheRoadRunning,2024-11-09T06:07:11,1
"It really seems like you're being spoon fed outrage manufacturing being upset over Whitmer and the Olympics rather than those things actually being offensive.  My wife and I missed the Olympics opening ceremony but watched a recording to see what the hubbub was about after the outrage. Over a many hours long ceremony that ""last supper table"" was a very short element of it used for a fashion walk. It didn't reference the last supper it referenced Greek mythology and decadence which fit well with the fashion theme going on. You need to make sure people aren't feeding you outrage in order to manipulate you into thinking that religion is being mocked when it really isn't.     Same deal with the Whitmer Doritos thing. I literally haven't even heard of that. It's not on anyones radar except likely the media spoon feeding you telling you it was there to mock the Eucharist.

"Because we live in an overwhelmingly Christian country. In India the atheists focus on Hinduism. In the Middle East they focus on Islam.  The idea that non religious people focus on Christianity exclusively is a complete misnomer. As someone who is anti religious I don't ignore the fundamentalist Jewish communities popping up in New York State taking over towns and school districts      [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/nyregion/hasidic-yeshivas-schools-new-york.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/nyregion/hasidic-yeshivas-schools-new-york.html)     Nor do I ignore the Muslim community which banned gay flags in blatant violation of the first amendment.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/17/hamtramck-michigan-muslim-council-lgbtq-pride-flags-banned#:\~:text=This%20week%20many%20of%20those,to%20celebrate%20the%20LGBTQ%2B%20community.  Every religion is being held to the same standards. Christianity is simply the biggest problem. When you look at the history of Christian values they're pretty bigoted and they are openly attempting to infiltrate American government. Something like 70% of the country is Christian only 1% is Muslim and only 2.5% Jewish. When Muslims and Jews start pushing their equivalent of project 2025 and banning pork like Christians ban abortion you'll have an actual substantive point.
