Great news! She was using her taxpayer-funded federal position for partisan sociopolitical ideology. She wasn't content on being a librarian. She was an activist-librarian. That shouldn't be the role of the Librarian of Congress.,chrismireya,2025-05-09T11:24:36,103

Liberalism is a religion of hate.,Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-09T11:47:55,23
I would even amend that to say leftism instead of liberalism. Classic liberalism is more similar to current conservatism than leftism.,WatchLover26,2025-05-09T12:05:15,7
"I wonder if because many of them don't have religion in their lives, if something like the cult of leftism is so easily capable of coming in and swooping them up. I'm not a big fan of organized religion at all, but I am a church-going Christian with faith. I do wonder if, without that, there is a big hole that is easily filled and manipulated.",North_Moment5811,2025-05-09T11:51:33,-2

"Their religion is postmodernism. They are committed to the idea that there is no objective truth, that there is no such thing as good or bad behaviors. Any disparity in outcome must be because someone cheated, oppressed others, etc. They seek to destroy all that is good right and successful and elevate evil wrong and the behaviors that lead to failure. Their religion revolves around constantly trying to show that right isn't right and wrong isn't wrong. This is why they are on the wrong side of quite literally every issue.",day25,2025-05-09T17:11:12,9

Yes. It gives them things to latch onto and believe in. Whether they realize it or not that is a very human thing to do. Where and how you direct it is critically important.,North_Moment5811,2025-05-09T11:55:28,5
"I was talking to a friend about the 2020 election at the time and he asked how the hell people could vote for the democrat party.  I thought about it and I told him. That the current day liberalism , leftist is their whole life. This is how they define themselves. A normal person might say I have a family we love to go to the lake, backyard bbq‚Äôs with family and friends, maybe vacation at the shore.  Leftists describe their feminism or how they protested whatever misdeed. They fly their flags at home and outside businesses when no one cares. They will scold you in store parking lot for having a pro 2nd amendment decal on your vehicle.  So when they go to work they can‚Äôt turn off the organizing because that is fundamentally all they have.  So what many of you have said already this is the left‚Äôs religion.",Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-09T13:42:16,4
