"when will these people go the fuck away?  >During his first few weeks in the Senate, Tuberville joined a group of Republican senators in objecting to the certification of presidential election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, two states Joe Biden won.",keyjan,2025-04-25T11:04:36,23
Who's going to inherit his position as Dumbest Fucking Senator? My money is on Ron Johnson.,gfh110,2025-04-25T11:30:40,16
He is a profoundly stupid man. An off-the-charts fuck-wit.,PointKey2800,2025-04-25T11:40:12,10
Shithead should shove a football up his tight end (and become the wide receiver we all know he is),hmochoa95,2025-04-25T11:08:17,5
I like that he's focussing on shitting his infinite stupidity on Alabama as opposed to the entire country,ElPlywood,2025-04-25T11:19:33,5

Dumb as a rock and doesn't even live in Alabama.  Perfect.,Independent_Brief_81,2025-04-25T11:40:14,4
So he finally realized that Senator is entirely over his head and is hoping that moving down a level or two will save his ass? I don't think so. Even Alabamans realize what a fucking idiot this guy is.,blatantinsanity855,2025-04-25T11:37:02,5

Tuberville’s move is a concession to the fact that he’s simply too dumb to handle the archaic rules and complex voting strategies in the senate while managing a staff. As Governor of Alabama he can revert to being a good ol’ boy talking football and dealing with a bought and paid for state senate and house.,blue_quark,2025-04-25T18:19:27,3
alabama you don't want him,haroldthehampster,2025-04-25T12:15:09,2
I’m disappointed that Tommy Tuberville is not 500 pounds & one of those guys whose bellies hang out of their shirts.,jl56649,2025-04-25T18:06:48,2
Perfect. Maybe he will accidentally succeed from the Union,xyz_rick,2025-04-25T13:20:23,1
A worthy successor of George Wallace.,phosdick,2025-04-25T14:16:59,1
Much better to have this much stupid contained where it belongs: Alabama. Stop infecting the country with this aggressive know-nothing idiocy.,DemandredG,2025-04-25T14:51:14,1

This is quite common. A Senator from Colorado is running for Governor of his state too. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T11:11:18,1

"He was fired from almost every job he's ever had.  The only one I can remember in which he left of his own accord, was leaving Mississippi to go to Auburn, after he told reporters and the public that, ""the only way he'd leave Oxford was in a pine box.""",Sahasrlyeh,2025-04-25T12:43:19,2
Is he one of the guys who was accused of tolerating sexual assault in the locker rooms? Or was that just gym jordan?,keyjan,2025-04-25T18:11:25,1
"Unless they are a real mover and shaker like Pelosi or McConnell, a lot of senators would benefit more from state level grifting than they do at the federal level. They’ve already proven they can win state wide elections so it makes sense. You’d be less likely to see this with state reps because their win was within their district. If they are a kook, likely so is their constituency. They don’t have to have the same broad appeal a senator or governor has to have.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-25T11:18:13,1
He quite literally isn’t? He’s still seeking political power,JewsieJay,2025-04-25T16:28:17,8
"Kennedy is actually one of the most academically accomplished senators. Degrees from Vanderbilt, UVA, and Oxford. He puts on the aw shucks bullshit for his lower educated Louisiana voters. Con artist.",TheSouthsideSlacker,2025-04-25T12:08:18,7
I agree. It’s amazing how his drawl turns on and off with the seriousness of the question. Guy is as phony as they come.,blue_quark,2025-04-25T18:22:44,3
Well his theatrics had me fooled.,dognosebooper32,2025-04-25T12:13:53,2
