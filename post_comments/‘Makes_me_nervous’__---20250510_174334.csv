"It’s fine, most of us won’t even live long enough to be affected by this tax plan anyway. Do you still have to pay taxes while you’re being worked to death in an El Salvadoran gulag?",SquidTitsOMG,2025-05-10T17:46:32,1
"Trump has absolutely ZERO intention, ZERO  to raise taxes on the rich, nor does he want to. This is all smoke.  Just when Elon questioned if they could give every American $5K ( 1.7 Trillion dollars) from the massive fake DODGE savings.  It is all just to fool people for a minute into believing the untrue.",YaklDakl,2025-05-10T17:50:33,1

">...not raising taxes is the ""core DNA"" of the party.     You call that a reason not to raise taxes on the wealthy? Take food from the hungry, research from medical science and cut every agency under the sun because that's in your DNA? Good fucking lord. How does the GOP live with themselves; it's sickening.",invalidpassword,2025-05-10T18:05:57,1
