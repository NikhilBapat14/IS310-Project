"To start, let's see what the Constitution says about vetoes. Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution:  >Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.  So when a bill is passed by Congress, the President has 10 days to veto the bill. If the President signs (or doesn't sign) the bill, it becomes law. The exception is if Congress goes on recess within the 10 days, so the President can't return the bill vetoed. This is called a ""pocket veto"" where the President doesn't sign the bill, but because Congress isn't present to receive a veto the bill fails to become law.  So looking at your scenarios:  >Like not directly sending a bill back to the congressional clerkâ€™s office but instead tweeting out something critical of the bill within 10 days of it passing and then not signing it.  If Congress is in session during those 10 days, the bill becomes law unless the President explicitly ""returns it with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated"". So tweeting out something critical would likely fail to count as returning the bill to the Chamber of Congress in question. The DoJ under Trump has repeatedly argued that Presidential tweets are not taken as orders because they are not direct enough, so it's unlikely the government would change that stance.  >Or another example could be the president claiming they informed a member of congressional leadership on a phone call that they disapproved of the bill, but never put it in writing?  You're starting to get into grey territory, but courts would likely err on the side of tradition, and say failure to return the bill to the House in a physical form (as has always been done) would fail to meet the spirit of the Constitution and wouldn't count as a veto.  >Or on the flip side could congress create a requirement so onerous that a veto is effectively difficult, or impossible, to do? For example, by requiring that they be informed of the veto by the president showing up, in person, to deliver a 24 hour speech explaining their reasons for opposing the bill  So this is starting to get into a grey area, because courts generally don't get into political questions (known as the ""political doctrine"", where courts won't rule on issues that are very political like ""checks and balances"" questions). But if Congress attempted to stymie Presidential powers through excessive legislation, there's a good chance SCOTUS would rule with the President. Courts generally don't like one branch trying to railroad or strip powers from another branch when it's explicitly laid out in the Constitution.",ProLifePanda,2022-10-24T20:06:34,5
"The first one pretty much already exists. It's called a pocket veto, where the president doesn't actually veto it, but lets the term on Congress run out before he answers, which starts the process over anyway. This only works at  the end of a term of course, but it has been used plenty even before Presidents were on Twitter.  But the other stuff I'm pretty sure you couldn't do. The SCOTUS has gotten involved before to strike down folks who get too creative with the veto. The line-item veto, where a president could pass the bill but veto the parts of it he didn't like, was struck down, for example, and I feel like any sort of shenanigans along the lines you're suggesting would see a similar treatment.",mormagils,2022-10-24T09:18:42,1
"The line item veto did not involve the president's veto power.  Congress passed a law that created a procedure where the president could cancel individual line items in budget bills unless congress voted to block the cancellation.  Before that law was passed the president could request individual line items be cancelled, but congress had to vote to approve the cancellation.   In other words: the ""line item veto act"" made it so that if congress did not respond the cancellation automatically went into effect.   The word ""veto"" was used because the mechanism was similar to a veto, but it had nothing to do with the president's constitutional veto power.",unebaguette,2022-10-24T23:21:12,1
