"How can they possibly rationalize this? The imminent harm is to the person ILLEGALLY ABDUCTED AND TRANSPORTED. That's really it, then. This means literally anyone can be transported into a slave camp in El Salvador and never be seen again.",SadBadPuppyDad,2025-04-07T16:44:39,1

"The ONLY reason to pause this court order, would be if by making the government comply it would cause some harm to the United States. In this case, it doesn't. Even if the administration wants to pursue a case to deport him, there is zero harm in doing it while he is in the United States.  John Roberts is risking this man's life, and leaving him to suffer in a foreign prison, for no reason.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-04-07T16:47:26,1
US supreme court has become a joke.   American can deport a person illegally in US but they should not be able to send them to jail in a foreign country in absence of criminal behavior.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T16:48:28,1

I thought they said they didn’t have to return him by midnight tonite and it was not saying they didn’t have to bring him back at all. They should still be bringing him back.,YellowZx5,2025-04-07T16:45:40,1

"You know with all these pics of protests and new article headline, I sometimes felt if I make it black and white; everyone would think that it is from the 60s.  That's how regressive we are in the past few months.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T17:34:33,1

"i mean can they detain him in the US without due process? like until they settle this? if he has access to reporters to tell his story that would *definitely* do harm to the United States. Also, if he is already in the crematorium or something and they would have to admit he has been deported to heaven, that would likely cause harm to the united states, as well. so there are definitely cases where demanding his return could hurt the state.",True-Surprise1222,2025-04-07T17:33:28,1

I expect the issue is that the court probably doesn't have power to give orders to El Salvador but the court can order the relevant US officials to request it.,planck1313,2025-04-07T18:15:10,1
