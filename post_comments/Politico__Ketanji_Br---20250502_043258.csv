"That’s funny. Didn’t a president and two presidential candidates already say that Trump is a threat to US democracy?  “A democracy, if you can keep it.”  -Benjamin Franklin",sharp11flat13,2025-05-02T07:42:05,3

"The most important graduate of Miami Palmetto High School speaks up.  I wonder if it bothers Jeff Bezos that he's not the most important person to graduate from his high school. Especially a school like Palmetto High, where competitive upper middle class families take superlatives and achievement very seriously. He was absolutely crushing it until she became a Justice.   Now, he's just ""of note"" and ""successful"". She is ""historic"" and ""an important voice"".",1984isAMidlifeCrisis,2025-05-02T05:41:32,4
"Your colleagues disagree, ma'am, and thus far have actually helped it along, so unless you plan on backing that up with anything, the only ones meaningfully taking action here are the ones dismantling these systems",EthicsOverwhelming,2025-05-02T11:55:37,2

"Then do something. I get the courts have prosecuted and Brown is great, but let’s do something. You’ve got a president in full contempt of the Supreme Court. Do something. Get all deported to CECOT back in the US. Nothing less is tolerable.",jgoble15,2025-05-02T09:07:26,1
kinda funny how they dont care about trumps attacks on democracy till he comes for them...,nazarein,2025-05-02T09:04:50,-2
Talk is talk. Just judge properly when cases land on the SCOTUS docket over this. And call out wankers like Alito and Thomas by name.,steve_ample,2025-05-02T05:57:13,-4

Is this not a justice who has consistently been opposing all of trump’s shenanigans? I swear half the problem with this country is y’all’s complete inability/refusal to engage with something as barely nuanced as “different scotus justices have different views”,Mystery-turtle,2025-05-02T09:24:12,2
