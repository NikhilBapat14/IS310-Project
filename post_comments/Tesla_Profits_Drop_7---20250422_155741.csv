He said heâ€™s going to spend more time at Tesla but Iâ€™m not sure what that will accomplish. The Tesla brand is toxic to over half the country at this point. I live in very liberal Seattle and it felt like every other car was a Tesla six months ago. Now I see less of them and many with anti-Elon/fascism stickers on the back.,largegaycat,2025-04-22T20:15:04,1

Idiots still think Trump is a good businessman. The average American has no idea what it means to be an actual good businessman and thinks itâ€™s equated to a ceo who does performative stunts.
