I actually think what is absurd is the sitting US President said he wanted to “deport” US citizens and the leaders of this country are doing press tours.,1882024,2025-04-22T14:42:40,7

They want to eradicate all poor people and they're using immigrants as the back door to do it. [They're not even hiding it. ](https://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=4priS84Bhkf7aH-e),NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-22T13:41:38,8

"They want to throw out enough poor people that the remaining will have no chance but to work the jobs that the rich require to keep up their standard of living, no matter the conditions.  It helps if you obliterate any kind of opposition.  Unfortunately the actual opposition is snoozing away and can’t be bothered to do more than print snarky remarks on ping pong paddles, except AOC and Bernie.",ampolution,2025-04-23T00:17:37,2

"AOC and Bernie are leaning heavily into this kind of high-intensity election messaging, and honestly, it’s beginning to feel off-putting. The tone and urgency of their campaigning seem out of step with the chaotic political landscape we’re actually in.   With the way things are spiraling, it’s hard to even be confident we’ll make it to the midterms as we know them.   The Republican base seems more radicalized than ever, and at this point, even if we managed to keep free elections, I’m not convinced it would be enough to steer the country back toward stability.",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-23T00:26:40,1
