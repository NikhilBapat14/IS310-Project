"I'm reminded of everyone who vehemently denies the fact that MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible.

We elected Biden after MAGA attempted a violent coup and the Democrats just sat on their hands for four years.  WTF would electing them have done?

No surprise those adherents are shitty, Christianity is about believing in something one has no good reason to believe and then sticking to that regardless of any and all evidence that what they believe is a complete load, then attacking anyone who doesn't believe like they do.
