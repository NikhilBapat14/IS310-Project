make sure to stock up on fluoride toothpaste sometimes the dentist sells the better stuff but i recommend just going online or just at your store and look at the fluoride contents.   things are about to get worse for the lower and middle class. the homeless who relied on tap water or water fountains will suffer the most out of all these. try to donate fluoride toothpaste to local shelters ):,Akraxs,2025-04-07T17:49:35,1

"The biggest issue that when this happens, decaying/infected teeth in kids goes up. It's not a kid's fault if their parents don't teach or care about dental hygiene.

So if something does happen, you're not in financial ruin. Here? Good fucking luck.   It's quite literally the bare minimum we can do for kids here.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-07T17:51:08,1
