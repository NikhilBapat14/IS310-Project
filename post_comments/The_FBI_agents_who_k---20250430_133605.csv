Kneeling is the greatest act of submission a person can perform. You are lowering yourself to a moment/authority greater than you.   Kneel before God; kneel before your GF when you propose; kneel over the grave of a loved one; And.... that's it.   To submit to anything less than this is a disgrace. To do so while in service of your country is even more of a disgrace.,_TheConsumer_,2025-05-01T01:41:02,1

"""Broadly speaking, police forces are doing a very bad job in some ways"" is a *perfectly reasonable* position to take.  But BLM was specifically and clearly anti-police, pro-vigilantism, and often violent.  And **EVEN THAT** is all within a person's rights to support.   But you can't do it when someone might mistake you as a representative for the government - such as when wearing a uniform.  And you can't do it on the clock - I'd expect BestBuy would fire you if you got caught wearing a blue polo in a viral picture taken at a protest.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-30T15:30:18,0

"As the video someone else posted points out, a deep concealment holster with her body geometry would tilt the holster inwards and make it difficult to reholster the firearm.   If she was used to not using a deep concealment holster and instead a normal duty holster which would position the firearm further away from her body, she may not have been evaluated with that particular holster or may not have used it that much.   I don't think we have the context necessary to know whether a failure to reholster in a stressful situation with that equipment is necessarily neglectful or incompetent on her part, or if she simply wasn't adequately trained for the exact particulars of this situation. Like I said, it's definitely embarrassing and there's some sort of failure here, but I'm not willing to wholesale throw someone under the bus like that over what is essentially an optics problem rather than an actual safety issue. She failed to reholster, she didn't fail to draw the gun or have a negligent discharge. If she's reholstering that means the threat has already passed.   If we were doing a FMEA chart the risk of her fucking up is high, but the consequences of her doing so are relatively low.",Typical-Machine154,2025-05-01T13:58:35,1
"No, you’re just making excuses for someone who obviously isn’t capable and I don’t understand why when it’s plain as day.

"That last line is pretty telling... ""The consequences of her doing so are relatively low.""  I would counter that *any* fuckup related to a situation where she needs to draw her weapon while protecting the would-be president carries grave consequences.  So... No, I would argue that the severity of the situation would make the consequences of any fuckup on her part rather grave, and not merely ""relatively low.""  Even a minor error in a critical situation becomes a severe threat with potentially drastic consequences and should not be written off as ""relatively low.""  The classic example is pilots talking while flying a plane.  Normally not a big deal.  But sterile cockpit procedures (no talking except as relates to the task of landing or taking off) were created because the normally low consequence action of talking in the cockpit becomes an extremely high consequence actions during the critical situations of takeoff and landing.  Same deal here... A normally low consequence error is elevated due to the criticality of the situation... And when the frequency of the error is already high, that constitutes an unacceptable risk.",Shadeylark,2025-05-01T14:30:46,2
Yeah and in aviation everything is triple redundant because the risk of a fuck up is extremely high and people aren't capable of performing to the degree that any less than that would require.   That's why there's multiple agents here. Each individual agent isn't expected to be totally perfect in all situations because that would be impossible.,Typical-Machine154,2025-05-01T15:48:30,1
