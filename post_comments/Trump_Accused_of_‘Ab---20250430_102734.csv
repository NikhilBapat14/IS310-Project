"I clicked the link and literally could not find an article to read - just the headline and the author byline...and a ton of ads.  Is the child a US citizen?  If yes, maybe holding onto the child was the procedurally correct approach, though i doubt it. Apparently, according to a lawyer I was arguing with the other day that was upset about them 'deporting' a 2yro usc child with her alien mother while father (who may or may not be a citizen) was trying to get an order keeping mom from taking the child (and bear in mind there's no evidence ice knew about that), ice was supposed to call child protective services to take the child and figure out whether there was anyone else who should have the child over her own mother.    But if the child wasn't already USC, then yeh, sounds like outright kidnapping unless the immigration court somehow granted the child relief, but not the parents - an unlikely event.  The problem with trump and these child related deportations isn't the deportations themselves, the problem is haste and inconsistency from the government, and lack of facts in reporting.

"> We didn’t deport US citizen children.

In fact for one case one of the parents absolutely said they wanted their child to stay and be returned to them and the child was deported anyways.   Courts are even looking at these cases and going 'wtf is going on here'.   And the one case the mother never came in front of a judge, we only have the statements and reports put forward by the government agents on why things happened the way they did.   &nbsp;  And no single parent (when there is two) should ever be able to make a life choice like that. It should be worked out between the two parents. Sometimes a court has to step in to make the final determination.

I'm still not seeing the propaganda you initially asserted.   I believe you've made a logical error extrapolating from the article under discussion to ""the media"" in general, and are overgeneralizing ""the media"" on top of that.  Certainly some media are supportive of this administration's actions and some are not.  It sounds like you accept the government's position on this.
