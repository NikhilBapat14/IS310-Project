- effectively killed solar in the US,decaturbob,2025-04-22T05:13:19,3
"Were most of these solar panels actually made in south east Asia or were they mainly Chinese ones with minor value addition in Southeast Asia ?   I think, going forward countries will have to implement some value addition criteria so that they don’t become a pass through country for Chinese goods",wetsock-connoisseur,2025-04-22T01:19:52,2
Quite a few Chinese companies have solar facilities in Turkey. A bit of supply chain shifting and those that do will profit more.,Sinocatk,2025-04-22T02:29:16,1

I'm guessing this means it cost that much more to produce them in the USA which would see a huge cost increase in solar installation,couchred,2025-04-22T02:57:55,2
"Doubt it, sure some ones getting paid, and the number, yeah you are right about that.  Could be any why or how, be interesting finding out.",Chaoslab,2025-04-22T03:56:18,1
"It’s good for the rest of the world maybe? More panels to go around for the rest of the world so cheaper for us, or maybe lower production so less economies of scale so more expensive for everyone. 🤔",HippityHoppityBoop,2025-04-22T08:04:25,1
"i doubt anything short of outright manufacturing in the US will suffice. so this is just shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic. in the alternative, the other countries can accept concessions that give up their sovereignty to the US, which is even worse than tariffs.  take a look at Canada for example. if Canada just join the US, there be no tariffs. but you understand why the cure is worse than the disease.",SQQQ,2025-04-22T11:13:29,1
"you don't help domestic manufacturers by making foreign products more expensive, unless those foreign products are specifically trying to undercut your domestic market to destroy domestic supply (""flooding the zone"" tactic).  You invest in domestic manufacturing.  Once the infrastructure is in place for you to legitimately compete, or at least get within spitting distance  then you move against the international  suppliers to  boost your own.     This is a process that takes year, or decades.  It's not something one administration can accomplish.  Not only is Trump doing things the wrong way, but his eagerness to be the one to finish the job of restoring american manufacturing (in his eyes) is a foolish endeavor, doomed to failure even if he were competent.",GaimeGuy,2025-04-22T01:23:04,12
"I'm dying to know where those ""domestic manufacturers"" are supposed to get their rare minerals from. You know, the  ones that are needed for solar panels and China no longer exports to the US.",Zizimz,2025-04-22T01:35:42,4

This has been a long term goal of China with rare earth. They are more interested in using the supply for control rather than profit.,Plzbanmebrony,2025-04-22T01:28:41,1
"Why do you think he wants Canada and Greenland so bad, so they have an alternate source and china is not cornering the market.  But only China has the machinery required to refine rare earths, because they got them from us when our mines became not worth mining anymore.   So we would have to mine all these minerals and then build the refineries.   I mean its possible, but not while Trumps alive.",ReplyNo5429,2025-04-22T02:07:33,1
"I know I'm pointing out the inconsistency in their statements. ""The govt shouldn't be picking winners and losers"" while they blindly support an administration that was doing it",TonyPerkisReddit4,2025-04-22T01:33:18,1

"He’s the healthiest dart player of this era, maybe ever.",heard_bowfth,2025-04-22T06:03:11,1
"Rare earths aren't rare in the locality sense such as gold, they're rare in the grams per m^3 sense but can be found pretty much everywhere in varying concentrations.   Meaning, practically any country can mine rare earths, it's just usally not financially profitable.  And, well, it pollutes massively, which is a reason most countries gladly buy those instead of producing them - and even then, the total value of the rare earths traded [isn't even that large](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1230682/china-export-value-of-rare-earths/), in total china exports rare earths for around $500M to 1000M per year.  The whole issue is massively overblown by people who know about as much about geology as trump knows about human decency.",anti-DHMO-activist,2025-04-22T03:57:18,1
Except under the CHIPS act with Biden we were building a manufacturing industry for semiconductors.  But Trump has put those grants in limbo because he sees a win for anyone else as a loss for himself.,L_obsoleta,2025-04-22T04:31:35,1
">Why do you think he wants Canada and Greenland so bad, so they have an alternate source and china is not cornering the market.  I think you're overestimating Trump's planning skills.    Trump wants Canada and Greenland because he saw Russia try to take over Ukraine and thought it was a good idea.  Canada and Greenland are just places close to the United States where the US could theoretically expand to.  The reason Mexico wasn't threatened is because of years of propaganda against Mexicans, but if he somehow took over Canada and\or Greenland, he'd set his eyes on Mexico as well.    Trump just doesn't have the ability to make deep plans or think a step ahead.",kia75,2025-04-22T02:23:41,1
"trump is also sabotaging that because we still import the raw materials, which are subject to tariffs.",GaimeGuy,2025-04-22T11:27:00,1
