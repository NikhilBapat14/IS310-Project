"“An anonymous cryptocurrency wallet that holds $2 billion worth of USD1 received the funds between April 16 and 29, according to data from crypto research firm Arkham. Reuters could not ascertain the owner of this wallet.  Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, who was incarcerated in the United States last year after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering, met Zach Witkoff and two other World Liberty co-founders in Abu Dhabi, according to a photo posted on social media site X on Sunday.  ""It was great to see our friends,"" in Abu Dhabi, posted Zhao in response, opens new tab to the photo, tagging Witkoff.  Zhao, who in 2023 stepped down from his role at Binance as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. over the illicit finance charges, remains a major shareholder of Binance.”",Orbitingkittenfarm,2025-05-01T09:24:48,15
It is not a stable coin as it is not tied to an underlying fiat currency. These types of coins are generally referred to as shitcoins due to their lack of respectibility/acceptance.,NotAKentishMan,2025-05-01T10:04:21,16

"I saw this in the New York Times:  > A Trump business entity owns 60 percent of World Liberty, according to the company’s website, and is entitled to 75 percent of certain revenue from coin sales, which could be converted into cash.  ( https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html )  Totally no worries about corruption and foreign political influence, though, right? Everything is fine.  Edit:   So, how do they make money from this?  > Stablecoin issuers like World Liberty make money by accepting deposits from investors, giving them stablecoins in return and then investing those deposits to generate a yield that the issuer keeps.  > The precise details of World Liberty’s arrangement with MGX and Binance are unclear. But it appears that, with one deal, World Liberty now has $2 billion in deposits to invest. Those funds alone could generate tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue for the Trump family and its partners at World Liberty.
