Very charismatic. Can listen to him speak for a long time and be transfixed.   Was lucky enough to have went to a big campaign event last fall where both he and Kamala Harris spoke.  As the actual candidate she had to follow him.  Seeing them side by side like that - he still has it in a way she did not.    In a weird f'ed up way Trump is also a transfixing speaker.

"We don't need Obama to come back. He is the reason Trump was able to win in 2016. Obama wasn't a horrible president, but he made a few massive mistakes:  1. In 2008, he bailed out the banks at the expense of the people when he should have bailed out the people and had the fraudsters prosecuted.  2. When he had a supermajority, he passed the ACA, which was an improvement on what we had, but he could have easily passed whatever he wanted. He chose the right wing answer to single payer when he should have passed single payer or a public option at the very least.  3. He did nothing to raise wages.  These things led to disenfranchisement and distrust among the working class, which led to Trump's talking points landing. If we all had higher wages, healthcare, and Democrats who demonstrably had our backs, ""Make America Great Again"" wouldn't land because life would be good for the majority of the working class. In a Trump vs Obama situation, the MAGA era will continue regardless of who wins",policri249,2025-04-08T12:24:45,2

The main thing is that neither of them should be able to run for president again. We need to keep the 2 term limit.
