">  The Domestic Emoluments Clause, outlined in Article II, specifically targets the Presidency. This clause stipulates that the President shall not receive any emolument besides his fixed salary from either the federal government or any state. Such legal stringency ensures that the Nation's highest office remains impervious to potentially corrupting domestic influences that may attempt to sway presidential actions.  >  These clauses maintain the integrity of federal offices. Legal frictions are notably highlighted in cases involving President Donald Trump, who, due to vast business interests, faced accusations of violating these constitutional stipulations. Allegations centered around his retaining ownership in businesses that received payments and patronage from foreign officials as well as agents of domestic governments. This stirred debates and legal inquiries regarding the boundaries of acceptability under the Emoluments Clauses.  https://www.usconstitution.net/emoluments-clause-presidential-business/",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-28T12:46:31,6

"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:   President Donald Trump recently announced that he would host a private dinner for the top 220 biggest holders of $TRUMP, the meme coin he launched days prior to taking office – and several U.S. Senators would like to know exactly why he’s doing this.  The dinner was publicly advertised on the $TRUMP coin homepage this past Wednesday, and included a special VIP package for the top 25 holders: a private reception with Trump, and a VIP tour of the White House the next day. According to the site, the winners will be determined by how much of the coin a contestant owns, as well as how long they hold it between April 23rd and May 12. “The more $TRUMP you hold — and the longer you hold it — the higher Your Ranking will be,” it said.

He has been doing that since his very first term. He spends more time using his high office to enrich himself than he spends on working to help America and its 340 million citizens.  I do not understand why people are only now calling him out about this.,crazybones,2025-04-28T14:28:08,1

"Trump is doing multiple things every single day that directly conflict with the constitution. We need to be angry at those elected representatives in the House and Senate who are enabling him.  Trump is a traitor, but those not stepping in that have the power to stop this are far more responsible for this situation.",Philosophical-Emu,2025-04-28T13:07:04,5
