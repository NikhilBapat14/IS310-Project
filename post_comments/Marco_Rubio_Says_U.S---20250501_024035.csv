"Time is a flat circle. (I've shared the comment elsewhere)  ""Utilizing existing buildings allowed the Nazis to quickly set up a functioning camp system without significant construction delays.""  ""The locations of the concentration camps in Poland were strategically chosen to align with Nazi German goals of secrecy and control. Many of the extermination camps, such as Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec, were situated in remote or rural areas, far from major population centers. This made it possible for the Nazis to carry out mass killings without drawing public attention, both within occupied Europe, especially within Germany, and internationally.  The political and social conditions in occupied Poland further contributed to this isolation. Under German occupation, Poland faced severe restrictions on freedom of movement and communication. Any resistance was brutally suppressed, and foreign journalists and observers were largely barred from entering the country. As a result, the full extent of the atrocities committed during the war remained concealed from both the Polish population and the outside world for a significant period.  Moreover, the choice of Poland allowed the Nazis to take advantage of existing anti-Semitic sentiments in certain parts of Europe. While many Poles resisted Nazi oppression, a small number were coerced into cooperating or chose to ignore the atrocities, mainly from fear and the instinct to survive. This combination of geographical remoteness and social fragmentation made Poland an ideal setting for the Nazis to implement their plans with minimal interference.""
