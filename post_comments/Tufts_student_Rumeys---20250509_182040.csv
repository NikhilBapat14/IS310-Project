"Wait, just to be clear:  They fly her to Louisiana, hold her for 45 days, are forced to release her and do so...**in Louisiana**???  1500 miles from her home? She just has to figure out how to get home on her own?     The United States is seriously fucked up",Zeta411North,2025-05-09T18:35:22,163

"> 1500 miles from her home? She just has to figure out how to get home on her own?   To be fair, if you get released in Louisiana of all places, you'd quickly gain superpowers to find a way to get out of here.  More seriously, that's part of the malice inside immigration detention system, makes it much more difficult to get quality law advice and visits from loved ones when possible, everything seems made to break these poor people despite not being actual criminals.",IcehandGino,2025-05-09T19:01:37,57
Trump administration is legalized kidnapping. üòÇ Matt Gaetz might want to apply to be an ICE agent so he can kidnapped.,kupomu27,2025-05-09T18:37:31,43
If the feds raid your place and destroy everything and find nothing they just wave and drive away‚Ä¶ they are through. They could give a fuck. Even if there is a complaint lodged it will take forever to even land on a desk where they will probably laugh.,enonmouse,2025-05-09T21:45:33,9

"Agreed.  It‚Äôs also meant to intimidate people who have less social, legal, or financial capital as well.  It reminds me of the Palestinian activist who got nabbed, then released.  He was all smiles and ‚Äúvictory‚Äù hand gestures, but I had a feeling that they weren‚Äôt trying to intimidate guys like him.",historicalgeek71,2025-05-10T00:22:26,10
That is literally what they did not too long ago. Busted in the door of a mom and daughter (a minor) who were in bed in their new home they just moved to and made them stand outside in their underwear while they ransacked the place and stole all the money they had along with their phones and drove off all because a migrant USED TO live there. They are literally just busting into people's homes and holding them at gunpoint while stealing everything they have and then driving off.,Finaldeath,2025-05-09T23:20:16,13

"Wtf are you even talking about. Millions of people would protest tf out of that. Not only that, but there are a lot of liberals stockpiling. Myself included. I‚Äôm not going to lie down if the government starts murdering people. They already are toeing the line dispensing with due process for immigrants.

"More people have died in ICE's detention this year, than all of 8 years of Obama's admin. So people are already dying ... and none of us are doing a thing.  I am having to do research with younger adults for work, and most people between 18 and 28 can't be bothered with the state of the world.\*  *\*One of the hypothesis is that social media isn't pushing out liberal content. One anecdotal is a friend of a friend going from 400K+ followers to 125K, and seeing her Meta income going from 3K to 1K a month.*   Folks that are showing up, and libs that are stocking up, are in the 40+s. Rarely we see folks in their 30s.  All we need to lead change is have 3.5% of the total population show up for protests. For the April 19th protests, we were at 1%.",oatchick,2025-05-09T23:15:10,4

No worries. I‚Äôd be mad too if I had plans to immigrate and this was happening. I‚Äôve thought of leaving many times but I want to be with my family. Probably at least one of my children (adults) would come but we don‚Äôt want to part with the rest.,Perle1234,2025-05-09T18:52:00,2
I would not come here now either. We will see in 2028 what happens. A lot of people love multiculturalism and welcome immigrants. I live in a very isolated area and am preparing for the worst. I‚Äôm not just stocking food.,Perle1234,2025-05-09T18:47:14,9
