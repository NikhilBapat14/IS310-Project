This was winnable.  We all know it.  We just needed to hold up our end of the deal.,Desperate-Ostrich707,2025-05-04T13:36:11,23

"There was also a signed peace agreement that Boris Johnson told Zelensky he needed to rip up. Rarely would I praise Biden, but the limit on military assistance was the right response to avoid major regional escalation. However, ripping up a signed peace deal invalidates all of that. There is no other explanation other than we wanted Ukrainian bodies to wear down the Russian war machine, and we didn't even really accomplish that.  And even the pope said the West led Ukraine to this war by taking away their nukes and then taunting Russia with NATO membership on their doorstep.",hereforthepeens,2025-05-04T15:51:53,-7
"If Ukraine wins, Putin falls and while that sounds great from a moral standpoint, the chaos and uncertainty you would get makes the US prefer Putin.",Odballl,2025-05-04T16:24:52,-5
Zelenskyy said Ukraine is limited by number and volume of weapons it receives more than anything else. ,SpiritedEclair,2025-05-04T16:47:47,2
"If I'm not mistaken, Russia still has only sent conscripts and reservists to the front lines (and some north Koreans)? I don't actually think a full scale war would be easily winnable. But America definitely made mistakes. I think the limit on weapons was wise, but only if a peace deal was truly the goal. Clearly it wasn't for America and Britain when they had Zelensky rip up the signed peace deal, so yeah, I would feel very betrayed and set up for failure if I was Ukrainian.",hereforthepeens,2025-05-04T15:55:24,-5
Nah if Ukraine falls Russia got the biggest most battle hardened army in Europe.+ a big domestic industry with stuff like drones. EU would be fucked fucked fucked.,Dunkleosteus666,2025-05-04T16:59:29,2
"Well, yeah. If Russia flooded Ukraine with 10 million experienced soldiers, then Ukraine probably would have bigger issues than they do now. The whole premise that Ukraine even survived the first month is wild in and of itself. The idea being that once Ukraine was able to create defensive positions and drastically reduce alternate modes of entry (sabotaging their own air fields and the like), it was no longer feasible to expect a quick annexation without committing troops or equipment that would spell out that this is a legit war and not just a reclaiming of land. Also, if Russia dedicated a mass of troops and equipment, I imagine that would be a stronger signal to Europe that they need to truly prepare for an attack and possibly dedicate more of their budget to defense.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-04T17:03:44,3
"The US doesn't want Ukraine to fall either. It just doesn't want Ukraine to win. If they did,  the US would have provided Ukraine's request for air superiority to actually end the war ages ago.",Odballl,2025-05-04T17:09:05,1
"russia can not find 10 million of any soldiers, all “experienced” are either already on the frontlines or dead or lost limbs  they’re hiding mobilization, avoiding biggest cities for a reason, if they declare mobilization more ppl will leave the country than they will be able to mobilize… their economy is crumbling  also they simply don’t have a capacity to process even half a million people for mobilization, 300-400k max… per year",GloryToAzov,2025-05-04T23:35:42,1
"Not sure why I'm getting down voted lol, but yeah, It definitely surprised everyone that their defenses held. Which is why Russia was willing to sign a peace deal, because shit was not going well for them and it would have been politically and militarily unwise to send their full army to Ukraine. But time was not on Ukraines side, after that was ripped up there were no good options going forward, especially with the corruption in Kyiv meaning that a lot of the financial assistance was stolen and soured Americans in limitless aid. So yeah, I would feel betrayed and hung out to dry by the US too. Because they were. But plenty of blame to go around other than just, we should have shipped every weapon of war overseas from the beginning. All of this was preventable. Even the fricking pope said that. As for your last point regarding Europe picking up the slack if Russia went all in, I don't think a nuclear strike would be something you can just try to gear up for after the fact. If the CIA is to believed that Russia was definitely planning on using one, hence their limited desire to fully go hard on Russia militarily",hereforthepeens,2025-05-04T17:43:47,-2
"Yeah well just like China doesnt want Russia to win, but not to lose either. Ensuring Russia is completely bled and toothless maybe the safest option. Or its civil war 1920s style but some factions get nukes. Fun!",Dunkleosteus666,2025-05-04T17:11:26,2
Sure. I just said 10 million as a figurative number,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-05T00:39:20,0
"I believe you’re being downvoted because there never was a real peace deal. The reason Zelensky didn’t agree to the “peace deal” was because the US and Russia would not demand that there be an assurance of peace after the signing.  I’d agree that there’s a fine line with restricting the targets that Ukraine could strike with the weapons given by the US. I mean, if Ukraine did strike Moscow, St. Petersburg with weapons supplied by the US, then you would probably see an increase in Russia’s troops and equipment; it would also give them some justifiability to those who eat up their propaganda.  The point is, Russia started the war and never had any goal other than annexation. If you believe otherwise, I would recommend reevaluating. The US walked a fine line in supplying Ukraine, although I personally believe they could have and should have sent more aid. Then, the US walks away and actually gave some initiative to the Russian troops through the multiple ceasefires and peace talks. In short: not only did the US walked away, but they made sure to coldcock Ukraine on our way out the door.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-04T21:41:53,1
