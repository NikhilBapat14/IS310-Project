Soo if they can afford to eat a hit like that withput raising the price is it safe to assume that GM cars have been significantly overpriced?,LightningLucia,2025-05-04T12:13:19,1
So everything is fine. UAW and GM board members are getting exactly what they voted for.,williamgman,2025-05-04T12:37:35,1

They can’t keep prices low forever. This is her betting things change. Plus people aren’t going to pay the higher prices so some revenue is better than no revenue,dicta85,2025-05-04T12:14:51,1
Most likely their market research team found American’s were not going to pay higher prices than what they already were so they’d rather get some money than no money.   Most of these companies have already optimized what they can price gouge people for to their limits unless their whole brand is built on being the cheapest thing available.,Deep_Alps7150,2025-05-04T12:19:56,1
I don't think GM cars have nearly the demand necessary to eat a 15-20% price increase because of tariffs so they are stuck in a tough place.,DataDude00,2025-05-04T12:32:42,1
"Prices will go up in 30-60 days after they have gotten rid of excess inventory. Plus, GM is too big to fail. Maybe not this time but that is was GM still thinks.",tech57,2025-05-04T12:38:20,1
"Prices are always settled at what the market will bear.  If someone is willing to pay X for a thing, the fair price of the thing is X.  If they are not, it's overpriced.  GM and every other company tries to sell their widget for more than their cost to produce to make a profit.  GM is profitable, not overpriced.  They will soon be less profitable if their costs increase but they sell at the same price.  They announced will be closing plants and laying off workers to stay profitable, though.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-04T13:16:45,1
"Exactly; especially when your factories are basically idled because nobody is willing to take on a commitment to pay for a car for 5 years, when their job could be gone due to tariffs any day now .. fixing the old one, is more economical, right now",Tricky_Damage5981,2025-05-04T12:36:07,1
