"[Here's more of the interview](https://youtu.be/8uhiwIFUoKQ?feature=shared), but it's on YouTube, so not a direct link. He teases Big Balls, but I don't think they show his face.   The man who talks about the cave is Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of AirBNB.",lady__jane,2025-05-01T21:10:01,-3
"MSNBC failed to report Biden's decline. Fox did and was told it was fake news. People don't trust the media - 59% of Republicans don't because of the lie told by MSNBC and CNN and others.  Many people ARE Republican - they're not on r/politics, apparently, but they do not believe the media because they have an agenda. 92% of news about Trump is negative - in the election, 95% of Harris was positive news and 95% Trump negative. That's why Fox is popular. Because they reported Biden when no one else did, and they told about the female pilot defying orders and killing 70 people when no one else did - because of agenda - and agenda shouldn't be part of news. (Fox has an agenda too on most of their night programs - so you get news elsewhere too - though I imagine someone would speak up if Trump declined in a way similar to Biden.)   The media keeps reporting about Garcia but doesn't keep [showing the link to DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1396906/dl?inline), where two judges in two trials said he was MS13, and a cop said he was MS13, and a police chief said he was MS13 (with receipts), and an informant said he was MS13. I'll provide a link, but you can check too. The problem is if we get him here, run him through a THIRD court session, send him to another place - he is MS13. He honestly should not be sent anywhere other than a prison where he will not beat or traffic or do things MS13 does (rape and kill). We cannot just send him out to anywhere other than El Salvador, which I assume a sane judge would order - and the president doesn't want the guy loosed on his country.  In all honesty, none of us WANTED to like Trump the billionaire reality tv star, so this liking has come from his actions, not the press.   Here is a [Gallup poll as well from 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx) - not even with Biden's stuff?",lady__jane,2025-05-02T10:47:01,0
"One man said that there were people taking money from the mass and only slush fund - and when DOGE had workers put in a receipt, they stopped drawing money out. They found workers renting Caesar's Palace or taking private jets - like, it started small, and then people realized there were no repercussions from taking the money. No receipt required. Contractors, whoever. The worker would name a cause, but it would be fake. A contractor received $130k for services but nothing attached. And there were payments to the Taliban? This was the Institute of Peace (so 1984). The institute accountant was deleting information, but Doge used what they had and referred it to the FBI and DOJ.   Edit: [This an interview from a month ago, with the leads talking.](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370654580112) They mentioned that it could be up to $500 billion in fraud. There's only one bank account - the treasury general account - that's at about 19:30.  DOGE interviews have just been on Fox, or I would have linked another station's interview - same with MSNBC.",lady__jane,2025-05-01T21:34:53,-16
foxnews is propaganda and therefore cannot foster any real discussion or create any insights  Also: why not invest all that energy and passion into making things better? Why regurgitate propaganda so enthusiastically?,Indominablesnowplow,2025-05-02T13:20:40,1

">why invest all that energy passion into making things better? Why regurgitate propaganda so enthusiastically?  Mostly because I wanted people to have the good too. There's a lot of fear for the Democrats, and it feels bad to have them be afraid. I listened to the news from CNN and MSNBC, and it just riles people to think they're not safe or that good things aren't happening. It must be really scary. They don't offer the other side.  So - witnessing? Not in the Christian sense. I wanted to reach out and give things that people might relate to. I didn't vote for Trump three times because I believed that all that press and louder friends couldn't be wrong. I started to pay attention, and I realized he's really doing good things that should help the country. He intends to. I agree with the intentions. Let me find something. There was a list. He's truly imperfect as a politician, but I think what's happening could ultimately be really good for all of us.",lady__jane,2025-05-02T15:10:34,1

The media would never have passed off the greatest fraud regarding a presidency if no fools existed.   I've noticed some people attack the individual instead of the assumption.,lady__jane,2025-05-01T22:36:51,-12
