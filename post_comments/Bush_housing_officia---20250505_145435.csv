seems unlikely to the extent laid out. however i think it probable there are presidential or continuance of government hidden bunkers and hardened facilities scattered around the country.  It would seem a prudent thing to have built in this nuclear age.,SerendipitySue,2025-05-05T16:14:17,28

"Just east/south east of redstone arsenal,mountain range,HSV..  Caves are abundant and was the destination for those not lucky enough to be O2 or above,was an active cd area for the longest time but haven’t touched its soil in years…  One used to go “caving”,bring a shovel,dig in these caves and find all kinds of interesting stuff..  Def not a trillion dollar operation though,I think something of this nature (and cost) would get noticed real fast..  I saw this earlier somewhere else….i call bullshit.",tsoxiko,2025-05-05T16:51:44,8

" Man that’s a good show.    As much as I enjoy considering a terrific, albeit whacky conspiracy theory - I just can’t fathom building that much, that far spread across the country, that cost many $Trillions - and keep it a secret.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T15:13:55,9
