">A Pennsylvania Republican named Ruth referenced the White House meeting where Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  >“They bullied him so badly,” she said.  >“Now, Donald Trump is making up the fiction that Ukraine started the war, it’s Zelensky who is the dictator, and America should wash its hands of its global leadership role,” she said. “But there are still Republicans and conservatives out there who understand that standing with our international allies is the right thing to do, and according to recent polling by NYT/Siena, a majority of Americans agree.”  If only there was a candidate that was standing up for Ukraine last November.",dblan9,2025-05-01T08:57:18,8

"Ruth is absolutely right. That was bullying, pure and simple.  Bullying is disgusting and it's what emotionally immature people engage in. Trump and Vance need to do a huge amount of growing up.",crazybones,2025-05-01T09:19:07,2
"Just because you bold everything doesn’t make it accurate, or obscure the fact that whatever Trump is doing is still illegal and against the constitution.",hdiggyh,2025-05-01T09:12:54,3
