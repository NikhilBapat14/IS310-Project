In 100 days Trump has broken alliances formed over decades and centuries. It's all very sad and scary.,AllynCrane,2025-05-08T09:32:59,112
"On this side of the world — Germany — anxiety is real. We, like our neighbors in Denmark, are anxious, afraid, and confused — unsure whether we are still allies and friends, or if an army will actually invade and destroy one of the last natural places on this planet we call home.",pianoavengers,2025-05-08T09:16:29,48

"Excerpts:  Denmark, along with the U.S., are of the 12 founding members of the NATO military alliance.  Asked if the European Union and NATO can still count on the U.S. as a “reliable partner,” Pelosi said: I “absolutely hope so.”  “I think it’s essential to global security that the United States be an essential part of it,” Pelosi added.  Pelosi also warned of the dire consequences that would follow if the U.S. abandoned its NATO allies.  “I do think that if we as the United States of America do not honor our commitments,” she said, “I don’t know how we expect people to honor their commitments to us.”",D-R-AZ,2025-05-08T08:56:23,21
"The right of self-determination would be violated if Denmark ceded Greenland to the United States without popular support in Greenland in favour of such a transfer of territorial title, even if this were a completely peaceful process.  Prime Minister Frederiksen is thus right in saying that ‘Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders’, as Greenland cannot be ceded without the consent of its people. Are there any limits to this position?

"I don’t think “reality check” means the same thing anymore.   Common sense and logic and rules and laws don’t matter one iota to Trump and his supporters.   He could wake up tomorrow and decide to send the military to invade Greenland and Hegseth would do it. They don’t care about Congress, and the Courts have already shown they won’t do anything.   The real “reality check” is this — who is going to stop him?   Certainly not Nancy, I’m surprised she bothered to look up from her stock portfolio to even address this.",athennna,2025-05-08T21:39:42,1
"These headlines need dialed way back.  Nothing in this is a brutal reality check.  It's just basic facts.  The headline needs to state how an authoritarian deep state is peeking its ugly head out, not that a statement was brutal.  It isn't.  It was a eek statement at that.",joylightribbon,2025-05-10T08:41:56,1

"The American people who voted for Harris, Democrats in general, are your friends. You should feel neutral to anyone who didn’t vote but it’s not like you’d know who did or didn’t (personally I do not treat them as neutral but those are my own politics..)  Republicans voted for fascism and that is now what the world is dealing with. Republicans are not your friends, neither are they mine, nor are they anyone’s but themselves truthfully   Republicans have unfortunately got control of the car and will blame anyone but themselves for the wheels falling off",AlphaNoodlz,2025-05-08T10:45:38,36

"Well being sorry isn't enough then, it's all in your hands.  American people have to actually do something before it's too late, be an active and involved citizen, participate in grassroot movements and demonstrations, go to townhalls and express your concerns, take family and friends with you, hold your local representatives accountability, write to your senator or local authority, complain and demand for more and better for you and your loved ones.

"Norwegian here. The general consensus among people here seems to be that we can never trust America again, given that every two years there's a chance a new President or Congress/Senate will swoop in and roll back on any agreement  There's even some talk in the public space about getting closer with China, since they at least recognize the value of trade agreements where both sides wins",Severin_Suveren,2025-05-08T11:02:48,66

"Canadian here on this:  > The general consensus among people here seems to be that we can never trust America again, given that every two years there's a chance a new President or Congress/Senate will swoop in and roll back on any agreement  The sentiment is the same for most of us.  This is why our new PM keeps saying our past relationship with the US is over because of what Trump is doing and the potential for American citizens to allow a man like him to gain power again because Trump should have never happened in the 1st place, and the 2nd place just shows an epic fail in America as whole.  America needs therapy.  Lots of issues within its people and society brought Trump about and those issues run deep and need to be addressed badly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying ""all Americans"" in any of this; but America as a whole has a lot of work to do on itself before the country and their collective actions can ever be trusted again.  I don't know if Americans realize how badly he and his being voted in has harmed their credibility as a nation.",BIGepidural,2025-05-08T12:32:26,26
"I'm not exactly sure who to blame here, but for me, I think the blame lies on the republican party and also Fox News. The GOP is led by Fox News, the Federalist Society, and the Heritage Foundation. They are currently ridiculously drunk with power and out of control. It's going to take a lot to get this authoritarian shit show out of here but I do feel it can be done if people have had enough.   Don't blame this entirely on America. Blame it on the masses who fell for the siren song coming from Fox, Infowars and right wing talk radio. Those of us who haven't been brainwashed by this shit are absolutely mortified by what he and his goons are doing.",G-Unit11111,2025-05-08T11:25:14,36
