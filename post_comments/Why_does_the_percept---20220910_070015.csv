Older people vote more consistently. Older people have more wealth and connections to influence policy and politicians.,MyNameCannotBeSpoken,2022-09-10T15:18:14,11
">Whereas if you ask an older person, they might say ""MY VOTE is super important, in fact I feel that MY VOTE is going to be the one that decides the whole election""  I... don't think that's quite what they think. I think what ends up happening is that you realize how few people actually vote during elections like primaries and midterms, and you see how many times the ""wrong person"" gets elected all over the country. If you didn't vote, you know you can't really complain.",[deleted],2022-09-10T13:48:55,13

"I think this is real, and I suspect it's due to the fact that it takes a while, many years, for people to realize that the only reliable, if small, effect that they have on their human/political/social environment is through voting. changing society through most other means like protest, charity work, career, and unions can be slow, frustrating and often fruitless, but voting offers an instant perception that they're at least doing something.",cheeseitmeatbags,2022-09-10T16:00:08,2
"Generally, youngsters place less value on responsibility/duty that doesn't result in reward/recognition than older, wiser folks.     The older you get the more you understand responsibility and duty have value on their own, even with no expectation of individual reward or recognition.",playinthekarmagame,2022-09-10T17:46:30,2
"Selection bias. Younger and poorer people who also don't feel the need to vote, also tend to have less healthy lives and have poor healthcare. Leading to shorter lives and less likely to reach an age of an ""older person"" that cares about voting.",Osprey31,2022-09-10T15:21:41,-2
"Probably just shifting interests.   The average young person is much more into exciting fun stuff like partying, playing sports, going to concerts/festivals, etc. Whereas old people tend to settle into much more mundane and seemingly boring hobbies that don't require them leaving the house all that much. That's essentially where the stereotypes of old people always doing crossword puzzles and knitting come from. So getting into politics, something they can watch/read/follow from their own homes, is kinda a natural hobby for that demographic. Whereas a lot of young people tend to view it as a kind of chore.  This is especially true for old people who are retired. While their young counterparts are working 40+ hour weeks, they've got all the time in the world to binge watch cable news.   On top of that, networks like Fox cater to their demographic which makes them feel seen and heard for the first time in probably forever. It also leaves them feeling like they're an integral part of something important. And all without ever having to leave their living rooms (except to vote once a year).   That last point is why Boomer Facebook posting has exploded as of late. Suddenly they're not just the annoying grandparent that their grandkids secretly pray never comments on their pictures. Now they can use Facebook to interact with like-minded people in their age group and bond with them over their favorite new pieces of propaganda. And in return they're getting the same validation and human interaction that young people rely on social media for.",CaroleBaskinsBurner,2022-09-10T17:43:05,1
"Spose nowadays all ya really have to do is google the times an election has been decided by one vote; It's a nonzero number. Similar with propositions. The fate of millions often decided by the votes of thousands. It's not the end-all, but at the very least it's data everyone looks into for future politics. I can only guess people become aware of this with age.",techpriestyahuaa,2022-09-11T02:26:01,1
"If you think about politics from the standpoint of whether abortion is legal or who the next President is, you probably don't have much incentive to vote because your vote *isn't* worth much. No one cares what you think and your individual vote is faintly heard noise amidst the sea of opinions.  If you think about politics in terms of whether the street in front of your house is being paved or what the curriculum for your children's school is, then you have a great deal of incentive to vote because your voice *is* heard and your vote is one of a relatively small number amidst people you mostly know.  Young people tend to be more like the first group of voters while old people tend to be more like the second. Old people are far more likely to be invested in a community where their vote matters rather than simply being a statistical blip in a massive pool of opinion.",ViskerRatio,2022-09-11T05:24:05,1
"I was unaware of this. I see less value in my American democracy every year, it devalues my vote, in my brain that is.",MostDankEmblem,2022-09-11T05:49:16,1
Older people have more and stronger ties to their communities - they're more impacted by and invested in policy.,Longjumping-Bee-7698,2022-09-11T22:04:21,1
Have you considered the obvious: older people are more experienced than younger people. That experience translates into a better understanding of the political process.,cincyblog,2022-09-12T06:40:15,1
"I'm not so sure I really agree with the premise of your question that much. It is true that younger people tend to vote less and then tend to vote more as they get older, but I don't think you specifically see voters make a shift from not understanding the collective concept to democracy to suddenly getting it.  In reality, the shift is much more simple: it's a matter of personal stake. Most folks start to vote more as they approach their 30s because of two specific reasons. One, the stuff literally affects them more. It's kinda tough to care about interest rates when you're not buying anything with debt. It's kinda tough to care about ""the economy"" when you're a minimum wage peon and you're not really getting a raise regularly anyway. It's kinda tough to get bent out of shape about property taxes when you don't own property. Young folks just aren't impacted by policy as directly as older folks are, particularly when it comes to their bank account, which is a big motivator for most people.  Second, most folks are still figuring out who they are even into their 30s. Most folks enter young adulthood mostly reflecting their parents' political views. Sure, there may be some variation on the margins, or maybe they've wholly rejected their parents views on everything, but the point is that for a young 20 something, pretty much the entirety of your political personality is some sort of reaction to your parents, most of the time. The more similar you are to your parents, the more likely you've still got some political maturing to do as it makes sense that an individual voter will have different concerns somewhere. But even if you're highly invested in opposing your folks, the aforementioned lack of stake in key policy issues makes it likely that opinions will change as they are tested by actually being affected by the issues.  Simply put, voters start off not caring that much about voting not because of theoretical doubts on the value of collective action, but because they simply don't know enough about the intersection of policy and daily life to be strongly engaged. As daily life increasingly is impacted by policy, voters increasingly appreciate the value of influencing said policy.  Old people may not want to admit it, but they're more dependent on policy than they realize. Even the hardcore anti-government types are still waiting to cash their Social Security checks. Old people want to keep taxes low because they have fixed incomes and rising cost of living specifically impacts their ability to survive. Older folks need more healthcare, and more and more they are looking toward programs like medicare. They are concerned about passing on wealth. The list goes on.   Young people? Who knows where they will end up building their careers? Lots of industries have relatively minor impact from policy changes. Others have HUGE impacts. Young people still have the agency to greatly improve their incomes, so there's less need to stave off change that will affect their carefully calculated coming years. Young folks need less medical care, and when they do they usually have it through their job in the private sector or their family. The list goes on. It's just a different perspective on life.",mormagils,2022-09-12T09:34:25,1

Old people influence policy BECAUSE they vote. Why would a politician listen to people who don't vote?,Darkpumpkin211,2022-09-10T22:03:23,5
Not really. Most older people have zero political connections. Especially for national or even statewide races.  Local dog catcher in a small town.  Maybe.  Some older people will develop business and political connections.  But not the average person.,Whiterabbit--,2022-09-10T21:32:07,3
