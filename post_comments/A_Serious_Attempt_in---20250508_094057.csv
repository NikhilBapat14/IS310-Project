It is great that fascism failed *this time*.  But no one should assume Republicans won't examine every facet of how they were thwarted in order to break the law better next time.  Republicans are fascists. Republicans that are trying to rehab their brand by opposing Trump and MAGA are deliberately (or unintentionally) creating the illusion that the party hasn't gone full mask off.,InFearn0,2025-05-08T11:21:20,50

A serious attempt *by Republicans* to thwart democracy *again*...,GeologistOriginal800,2025-05-08T11:40:57,21
"No, this wasn’t some heroic failure of an anti-democratic plot. It was a distraction. Loud enough to get headlines while the real power grab slid under the radar. They did seize power.  They removed the head of elections, [Karen Brinson Bell](https://apnews.com/article/6222e773410c5edf4941ed31f3ff54ca?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and replaced her with Sam Hayes, a Republican operative and former legal counsel to the state House speaker.  They also stripped hiring and firing authority from the Governor and handed it to [Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek](https://apnews.com/article/1a840ac03ccc750aad25a60c4f292d0d?utm_source=chatgpt.com), transferring appointment power for the State Board of Elections away from the governor entirely.  So while national outlets chase drama, the actual structural power shift goes ignored. Mission accomplished.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-05-08T11:44:56,41
they still spent the time they wasted shifting appointment powers to the GOP-held auditor and these threads cheering for the end of the attempt to throw out ballots keep leaving that out.      the Board of Electors is under GOP control and more elections are coming up.,StoicJ,2025-05-08T12:17:37,6

"This headline’s a total f’ing joke.   NC is gerrymandered beyond redemption and this win is completely meaningless when the GOP holds a resounding 5-2 majority on NC’s Supreme Court.

Biggest lesson- we need to do better at the top of the ticket- dude wouldn't have gotten this far if the voter differential were 10k instead of less than 1k. Second biggest lesson- we need more judges appointed by the good guys who would have squashed some of this insanity. Next up is defending the other Dem seat in 2026 then trying to make a dent in the R advantage when 3 R seats are up in 2028.,Any_Will_86,2025-05-08T13:18:54,3

Yes embarrassing to be an NC resident.  All they do is drone on about securing the vote while they try to sap away voters’ rights.  As a resident here for about ten years the only time there has been interference or election fraud it has been perpetrated by the right.   This was by far the most egregious and only portends what will continue to come.,almosthomegirl,2025-05-09T06:23:10,2

"The GOP effort in North Carolina was a serious attempt, and would have been attempted more in other states if it had succeeded. So it's good that it failed.  And yes, for sure, other things were changed, and that's bad.   But this attempt to change the rules after a loss occurred failed, and that is a good thing.   All of these things can be true.

I don't think we are. The GOP loves to shotgun effect terrible outcomes in the hopes one will cause enough of a ruckus to let the others go through. I don't think they plan which one will but are prepared to seize on the opportunity when it does.
