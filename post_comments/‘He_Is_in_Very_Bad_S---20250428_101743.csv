">“Well, I have a slightly different view. I agree with you that they voted for him because they felt better, in my opinion, about-, they looked at the last four years under Biden-Harris and said, ‘not good.’ And they looked and remembered the four years under President Trump and said those were a lot better. I think this was a hope. I don’t think it was based upon an explicit understanding of what he was going to do,” answered Rove.  How many times did we hear the question this time last year ""are you better off now than 4 years ago?"" For those of us whose memories aren't shorter than our noses, spring of 2020 was NOT better than spring of 2024.  Just goes to show how frustratingly stupid the average voter can be.",Pretty_Boy_Bagel,2025-04-28T10:25:35,410

And this is coming from the guy who propped up Bush 2. Rove should be careful though. Herr POTUS doesn’t like criticism.  It cannot be said too loud or too often: Fuck Trump. And fuck his Faux-Christian enablers in Congress.  https://preview.redd.it/neztl8xjvlxe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52a9870bda706fdfb6a0ef33aefce0630e742747,dantekant22,2025-04-28T11:52:53,27
">When it gets to the economy, he is in very bad shape. And it’s not only that he’s in the short term in bad shape, there’s also evidence in the poll that no matter-, even if he gets his way on certain things like tariffs, that he’s not good in the long run. Take a look at this: Trump policies, today, will it help the economy? 32% say yes. Will it hurt the economy, his policies? 54% say no, 10% no difference. In the long-run, will help the country? 40%. In the longer run, will hurt it the country? 51%. So, there’s some very deep-seated skepticism among ordinary Americans about the effect of the economy, the president’s economic policies, both in the short run and the long run.”  Aww!",LolAtAllOfThis,2025-04-28T10:19:26,29

Trump won because moderate voters were unhappy with the economy and wanted to try someone different. They wanted more jobs and lower grocery prices. It's pretty easy to tell without listening to the news that both of those are moving in the wrong direction.,SlapHappyDude,2025-04-28T11:11:45,28

> They wanted more jobs  Since 2023 the US has had a maximum unemployment rate of 4.2%. This is basically full employment.  I wouldn't give Trump voters this kind of credit.
