I’m okay with this. Rates are historically still low,-deteled-,2025-05-07T16:55:17,9
"My parents saved money build a house in the 90s, no debt. Interest rates were likely 10% or more back then. Low interest rates create inflation and make it more difficult for people to save money and avoid debt. We pat ourselves on the back for getting a great interest rate sub 4% while housing prices sky rocket. 4% interest on a house that doubled in value within 10 years is not a great deal. Especially for people that want to stay in their home for 20+ years and would rather not see their property taxes sky rocket on house they don't intend on selling any time soon. ",GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-05-09T11:48:10,2
