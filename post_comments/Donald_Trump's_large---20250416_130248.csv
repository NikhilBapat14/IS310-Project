"Im an immunolgist, and run my own cancer clinic.  Ive said it in the past, and will again.  Trump has Rectal or Colon cancer, and is receiving Flurouracil most likely. Fluro doesn't cause hair loss like other forms of chemotherapy, and is a cycle dose. His skin around his eyes is getting extremely pale, which also lines up with chemo.  Im guessing he's on a 1 or 2 week cycle from how often the bruising shows up. I'll even go as far to say his ""physical"" was more of a chemotherapy appointment and check up.  Took him 5 hours in his appointment. Fluro is a 3-6 hour session. Bruising shows up within 3 days of his physical, which lines up with what I see in most my patients over 60.
