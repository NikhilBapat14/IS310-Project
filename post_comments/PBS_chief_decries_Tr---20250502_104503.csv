"Yup, going out of your way to be “politically neutral” doesn’t work for maga republicans.  You have to be Fox News propaganda to be considered useful to them.",LuvKrahft,2025-05-02T10:52:04,40

"Because it **is** illegal.   **Congress** is the entity that decides expenses. That's not even up for debate. It's just a fact, no matter what any moronic Trump supporter says; Congress makes this decision not the Executive.",TheNewTonyBennett,2025-05-02T12:12:18,8
"He’s such an asshole…  President Trump signed an executive order seeking to end federal funding for NPR and PBS.   Proportion of Federal Funding in Budgets  - PBS: With a total budget of approximately $2.65 billion, the $397 million in federal funding represents about 15% of its annual revenue.  - NPR: NPR’s total budget is around $314 million, making the $132 million in federal funding about 42% of its annual revenue.  However, here’s the key legal and financial reality:  Executive Orders vs. Congressional Authority  - CPB Funding is Appropriated by Congress The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) receives its funding through Congressional appropriations, not presidential discretion.  That means:  - The President cannot unilaterally cut funding—Congress controls the budget.  - An executive order may direct federal agencies to withhold cooperation or urge future defunding, but it cannot cancel already-appropriated funds.  - Legal Challenges Likely  This action will almost certainly face legal opposition (as it did in prior administrations when funding cuts were proposed but never fully enacted). The CPB’s charter and bipartisan support for local public stations make blanket defunding politically and legally complex.  Bottom Line:  While the image captures a bold political move, the actual funding impact depends on Congress and the courts. As of the 2024 fiscal year:  - CPB still received $525 million.  - PBS funding accounted for ~15% of its budget.  - NPR, via local stations, relied on federal dollars for ~42% of its total revenue path.",Reddit_wander01,2025-05-02T16:37:55,6

Maybe if they hadn’t sanewashed Trump so frequently before the election they wouldn’t be dealing with this.  I have been a donor for 30 years but some of the ridiculous both-sides attention/lack of digging in to the idiocy they did leading up to Nov caused me to “defund” them myself.,skipca,2025-05-02T11:39:06,4
Hope everyone at PBS and NPR boycott tRUMP's family Crypto business which he (tRUMP) is shamelessly hawking.,Fritja,2025-05-02T11:16:58,2
"If you want to support PBS, consider subscribing to PBS Passport. It allows you to subscribe/donate to your local station (or another of your choosing) and it's an incredible deal at $5/month. I've been thoroughly enjoying the shows, documentaries, and live performances. It also gave me access to NHK Japan which has tons of great finds.   PBS is made possible by viewers like you, and imagine the kind of PBS renaissance we could be on the cusp of if more people got involved and donated.  https://www.pbs.org/explore/passport",Bigweld_Ind,2025-05-03T17:17:01,1

"Public media cannot appease them without neglecting their mission. Resisting them through reporting facts is their only path.   Throw your local station 5 bucks and a message of support. Let them know you don't think they're biased.    They serve us, the listeners and viewers.",anemone_within,2025-05-02T11:39:40,12
Someone should do a running tally on how much Donald Trump is costing us in lawsuits.  Similar to what is being done with his golfing costs.,TSHRED56,2025-05-02T11:21:46,3
