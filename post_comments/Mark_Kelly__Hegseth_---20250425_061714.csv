"Article snippet:  > **Hegseth had an unsecured internet line set up in his office to connect to Signal, AP sources say** >  > WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon’s security protocols set up in his office to use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, two people familiar with the line told The Associated Press. >  > The existence of the unsecured internet connection is the latest revelation about Hegseth’s use of the unclassified app and raises the possibility that sensitive defense information could have been put at risk of potential hacking or surveillance. >  > Known as a “dirty” internet line by the IT industry, it connects directly to the public internet where the user’s information and the websites accessed do not have the same security filters or protocols that the Pentagon’s secured connections maintain.  >  > ... >  > But it also can expose users to hacking and surveillance. A “dirty” line — just like any public internet connection — also may lack the recordkeeping compliance required by federal law, the official said.  >  > The two people familiar with the line said Hegseth had it set up in his office to use the Signal app, which has become a flashpoint following revelations that he posted sensitive details about a military airstrike in two chats that each had more than a dozen people.

"Pete ""Whiskey Tanqueray Foxhost"" Hegseth wasn't qualified in the first place, and the GOP Senators that ""rubber stamped"" him despite the glaring issues should all be primaried, and Pete needs to be indicted under the espionage act for knowingly and willingly sharing classified information over an unauthorized, insecure application with individuals without the appropriate security clearance.",robcwag,2025-04-25T11:31:04,4

"I'm not saying Hegseth is passing on Intel to enemies of the state.  I think he actually is loyal to the US. Or at least Trump.  He's one of those ""alpha males"" who thinks he's big, tough, and always right.  The always right part of this is what I think is key.  He is bypassing security because either he doesn't think he needs it and it's a nuisance.  Or he is talking about stuff that he does want in the record.  Probably illegal acts that he thinks are the country's best interest.  Something where he believes the ends justify the means.",Bender_2024,2025-04-25T09:29:07,3

"Exactly. No one is stopping these things from happening. No one says no, that’s against the law. There’s no excuse.
