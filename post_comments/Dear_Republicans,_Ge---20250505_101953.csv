Why should they? They're in the catbird seat.    I've been having a long running debate in this subreddit with people who don't really believe we've been taken over by fascists. They're sure we can fix this in the next election.    I've studied a lot of history and there are very few examples where fascists take over a country and then get elected out.   Fascists are very good at using a combination of electoral machinery and just plain old violence and intimidation to make sure that once they're in power they **stay** in power.    I consider the complete lack of concern on the part of the congressional GOP more proof that they are sure that they don't have to worry about the 2026 elections.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T10:32:36,12

It all boils down to the fact that these are reactionaries, i.e. people who feel society is a natural social hierarchy where they are better than certain other people because of who they are. And because nothing in their worldview encourages growth, any social change is a zero sum game, often a perversion from the ideal order. ""Liberals"" are therefore the ones who ""take"" what is theirs, their (perceived) privileges and status, and ""give"" it to the undeserving. Other people striving for an equal share, especially when more and more of society's wealth is funneled to the top, creates a visceral reaction of rage and hatred in them, and this movement is the result. Everything the liberals do, or are perceived to do, is somehow an assault on their person because they need it to be in order to justify what they want to do to them.  It is entirely unsurprising that they're doing away with democracy, the rule of law, human rights, civil rights, ... They always hated those.

"> They will love him as long as he's entertaining, and their idea of entertainment is cruel. I feel like some of that comes from trying to cope with how miserable they themselves are, so the more miserable and uninformed everyone is, the more support he can harvest  Inflicting cruelty and harm on others without recourse, even by proxy, is a form of power. To troll, frustrate and anger people is another. That's the root of it IMHO. They are reactionaries, feeling the world as a social hierarchy where they are better than certain other people, and by doing this they make it real because to an authoritarian, power and status are the same thing. It's why all the racists, misogynists, bigots, oligarchs, religious fundamentalists,...

The key, it seems to me, is that they identify with him. They imagine he is them so when he takes ""vengeance"" on his enemies they can imagine they are inflicting their revenge on theirs. Hence why he can not be wrong in their eyes. To make sense of their own behaviour they have to believe that morality depends on identity: i.e. they feel they can do nothing wrong because of who they are, so neither can the side they identify with or the leader who personifies it. And the farther this goes, the worse it gets because if they ever start to doubt, then they become human beings making choices again, and having to take responsibility for those choices. Suffice to say that would be extremely bad for their self-perception, let alone their ego and pride.  Hence the relentless bad faith, the glee with which they commit immoral choice after immoral choice, the ""jokes"" about the awful things they want to do or see done.

"There are three kinds of leaders. One is a beacon of excellence, that inspires those around them to stand up and be their best selves too, through their leadership and example. Abraham Lincoln, Spartacus, and Winston Churchill are some examples of such leadership.   Another has an air of destiny about them, as if they have ascended beyond the realm of us mere mortals and have touched the divine. This kind of leader gains followers because those followers wish to be a part of the leader's vision and get swept along in their fateful destiny, too. A lot of the ""Great Men"" of history fall into this category, figures like Alexander the Great, ""Earthshaker"" Pachacuti, and Napoleon.  And then there's the third kind of leader, the one that *gives permission*. The one that says ""you can go to sleep"" or ""hate is allowed"" or ""you are the victim so they deserve punishment"". These leaders thrive off of permitting the worst, laziest, most morally bereft urges to come out of their cages and run amok. It's the bully at school with their two helpers kicking another child in the stomach after knocking them onto the floor, the priest that leads his flock to burn books with ideas they do not like, and the man in a white hood handing you a rope to lynch an innocent black man because they dared to talk to a white girl. Trump *gives permission*. Trump permits those that deny evolution to teach in the classroom, he permits vaccine doubters to run the human health services, he permits angry young lonely men to continue to be angry and to blame women instead of themselves for their lot in life, he permits idiots to be elevated and he permits ICE to militarize.

"I mean, respectfully, I feel like you aren't really aware of the situation.  The reason trump was so popular in 2016 was because he was a human being who spoke and acted in a way that was appealing to people. He said what was on his mind, even if it was crass, and he spoke to and about politicians in a way that many people, especially on the right who were super upset that a black person could ever become a president, could jibe with. Him saying to hillary ""yeah, I dodge taxes, just like all you liberal politicians do"" set the nail in the coffin for his voting base. He was a real person, someone who was going to drain the swamp.  The media demonizing him (rightfully, keep in mind, dont take this as me trying to defend him) is almost certainly what lead to his election. Its continued demonization, as well as the persecution (again, rightful, but persecution nonetheless) of his supporters doesnt lead to people who are willing to step back and say ""wow this guy is weird""  Saying that trump ""lets people be their worst selves"" is kind of indicative of this.

I want us, as a country to move forward from this and to try to find some common ground again. We can't do this if we condemn and go back to ignoring a third of the country.    This in mind, maybe ""let's people be their worst selves"" may be a bit harsh to a good chunk of his supporters. I did include the woefully misinformed, because they're are well meaning people out there who fell for some combination of misinformation and disinformation. I know a few sweet older people who voted for trump because really thought he would help with inflation, and that's all they really heard him say.   That all said, trump did have a nasty reputation before running for office. He was known for his dad's discriminatory renting practices, his bankruptcies, and being a con man in general. I'm pretty sure Future Biff in Back to the Future 2 is inspired by trump, and that movie was made in the late 80's. I guess not as many people knew him that way as I thought   While I agree, ""allowing people to be worse"" may sound harsh, but I do still think ""allowing"" is a big part of his appeal. I also disagree that media as a whole ""demonized"" trump. If anything, mainstream and fringe media has normalized his behavior. If he tried acting this way in a presidential run in 2012, his political career would have been over. For every news article calling him inappropriate or unfit or a fucking idiot, there was an article calling him a savior against the deep state, the chosen one, or a 4D-chess-genius. This created two parallel narratives of reality, and trump gave his supporters permission to act in his world and follow his rules.    While I don't think all of his supporters are blood thirsty demons, I do think some voted for the comfort of living in trump world. It's ok, climate change isn't real. It's ok, Mexico will pay for the wall to protect your family from gangs. It's ok, covid is a hoax. It's ok, other countries will pay the tariffs.

"Right, like I think the recent Star Wars post the White House made shows a lot about their psychology. Even with the ability to fully manipulate the photo, they still chose to give trump a red lightsaber. They constantly align themselves with the bad guy, the mobsters, the dictators, the bullies, because those figures elicit fear and absolute power. They think they’re as “cool” as Vadar is, they *want* to be the bad guys (dark gothic MAGA lol).   Calling them weirdos destroys that fantasy world completely, because it’s just the actuality of who they are as people. The undertones of calling them weirdos strips any and all “coolness” from them, it takes away their perception of power so they explode in order to try and compensate. It makes me think of those guys that think they’re “just like The Joker” or Patrick Bateman because they’re cool characters, yet IRL they always end up as social outcasts.",HeadfulOfSugar,2025-05-05T14:35:22,28

"I mean, obviously the nazis and the white nationalists support trump. That is a given. However, calling every trump supporter a nazi or white nationalist?   Respectfully, I think the thing you are saying that the statement is ""a bit harsh"" is, again, proving my point. Its like the fucking red-pilled idiots yelling ""woke"" for suggesting that women can lead in the media they enjoy. The way you describe the news cycle is exactly what I am talking about. If someone sees trump, sees that he is much more relatable as an individual and then sees a speaker on cnn or sees hillary clinton criticizing them personally, it doesnt dissuade them, it reaffirms their belief.   Like, look at the people who voted for both AOC and trump and you can see a lot of this goes beyond straight politics and just desiring a leader that is accessible to the public. You dont sit there and clown on people who want a leader who can speak to them at a level they can understand and appreciate and expect them to vote for a DNC politician.",Berb337,2025-05-05T22:47:51,1

"I thought I had addressed it a bit, but I want to make it clear now, I don't think every trump supporter is a nazi. They do have nazis in their party, and it would be cool if they did something about that, but that's a different discussion. I also don't intend to clown on anyone. There are certain personalities I don't care for, but overall I just want everyone to get over trump.    And I do stand by my earlier statement, about being misinformed about who trump is. Luckily, this is something that can be fixed.  Edit to add: Being misinformed isn't a crime and isn't always a personal failing. We're all ignorant of things, no one knows everything with certainty, it's a fact of life. Best we can do is draw conclusions with the information we have  I don't hate trump supporters on sight because beliefs, or creed or whatever, so long as no one wants to instigate anything. My problem is watching so many people fawn over a con man. I honestly see them more as victims, and I wish more than anything that we could all just wake up and work together again. I don't want anyone to feel stupid, I want them to look back at trump and his administration and hold them accountable",3qtpint,2025-05-06T00:51:15,1

Articles like this keep up the fantasy that the GOP might still self-regulate, and in doing so, give cover to establishment Dems. Democrats and the liberal media are the only ones still pretending the rules matter, refusing to break from a status quo that enables this mess.

"I hear that you interpreted my initial message that way, but that’s not what I was saying. My point wasn’t about blaming — it was about recognizing the reality that Republicans won’t act. This is pragmatic, power-focused realism. It’s not about fairness. It’s about urgency and outcomes in a political crisis. Waiting for Republicans to step up is a losing strategy, and we don’t have the luxury for that anymore.  You’re saying that if we stop expecting Republicans to act, we normalize their abandonment of responsibility and overburden Democrats. I get the concern, but that’s a norms-based perspective. That might have made sense in 2005, maybe even as late as 2017. But in the current context, where one party has openly discarded all norms without consequence, insisting on ‘symmetrical expectations’ feels like idealism. It doesn’t reflect the reality we’re living in, and while it might sound noble in theory, it’s harmful in practice.  In a healthy political system, your concern would be valid. But right now, my focus is on the power dynamics of this moment. This isn’t a normal crisis, so we can’t stick to the normal playbook. It’s not about abandoning norms — it’s about understanding that norms don’t enforce themselves when one side is actively tearing them down.  This is exactly how the Social Democrats responded as Hitler rose to power. They condemned the Nazis, issued legal challenges, and called on conservative elites to rein Hitler in — just like this article calls on Republicans now. The Social Democrats stuck to the rules, and it didn’t work. Norms don’t enforce themselves when one side is actively dismantling them. That’s the point I’m making.",Interesting-Cow-4597,2025-05-07T13:05:27,1

"Democrats may not control all three branches like the Republicans, but they still hold critical levers of power, both at the federal and state levels, which could help push back against the GOP coup. They also have international respect, significant public support domestically, and control some of the most powerful states in the country. This isn’t just a constitutional crisis; it’s a broader existential threat to democracy, and something must be done. The line in the sand here is not U.S. Republicans vs U.S. Dems. It’s fascists taking over the most powerful country in the world vs all people and governments that will suffer in that outcome.  While Republicans may hold the reins, their active role in dismantling democratic norms means the responsibility to act falls on those who will reasonably fight back while they still have the power to do so, even if the system is stacked against them. The time for action is now. It’s up to those who still have the ability to resist in whatever ways they can. This is the moment for bold, courageous action from our leaders.

"I don’t claim to know the precise moves they should make. What I do know is that they still hold powerful cards in their hand. The job of leadership is to play those cards strategically and with urgency when democracy is on the line. The playbook will have to evolve as the crisis does, but we cannot pretend they are powerless or limited to making polite appeals to fascists. This moment absolutely requires more than procedural gestures. It demands real risk — legal, personal, and political. Some people in power will have to be willing to face imprisonment, public backlash, and personal sacrifice in order to protect the country’s future.  They control key states, hold international credibility, have a huge grassroots base, and still have control of critical legal and political levers at both state and federal levels. Something must be done.  And this isn’t about hero-worship. The responsibility belongs to all of us. But history is clear: mass public action follows bold leadership.

"'They’re doing things: lawsuits' is exactly the kind of small, procedural, reactive move that keeps happening while larger abuses roll on. The problem isn’t a lack of ideas — it’s a lack of will to actually use power.  With Trump, Elon, and Vance openly saying they’ll defy the courts, claiming lawsuits are 'the only card in the deck' is functionally admitting there’s no plan to stop them. And you’re flat wrong — there are *plenty* of more powerful moves they could make, some of which I’ve already listed.  When a regime dismantles democracy and signals it will no longer abide by rulings, norms, or laws, extra-legal and extra-parliamentary action doesn’t just become morally defensible — it becomes morally mandatory. The refusal of establishment figures to recognize that is *how authoritarians consolidate power.*  The list is long, and frankly, it’s not my job to make it for them. They’re the political 'experts.' They should be leading us down a path of real resistance:  * Mass general strikes, occupations, and street mobilizations * Sanctuary networks for dissidents: journalists, organizers, public servants * Large-scale civil disobedience targeting infrastructure, enablers, and institutions * Formation of shadow government structures and parallel institutions * Appeals for international non-recognition and sanctions * Blue states threatening tax refusal and economic secession (blue states fund the country)  This isn’t complicated.
