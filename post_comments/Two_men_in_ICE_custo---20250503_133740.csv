Get ready for thousands to be tortured by ICE.,TheeHughMan,2025-05-03T13:48:56,48
"it really depends on what they mean by natural causes. Sometimes people in custody don't get proper medical care or their health issues aren't taken seriously until it's too late. So yeah, maybe their deaths could've been prevented if they got better treatment or attention. But without knowing more details about their health and how they were treated, it's hard  to say for sure.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-03T13:45:21,33

"Very likely, yes. But all prisons and jails have an abysmal record when it comes to medical emergencies or medical care in general, and it is something that is a risk for anyone imprisoned for any reason. This isn’t a problem exclusive to ICE custody.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-05-03T13:50:03,8

"ICE seemingly does this shit all the time. It’s so hard to even punish people in so many cases. For example, when the person who died in their custody doesn’t have any records in any U.S. medical system. It may be impossible to get any real evidence for them being healthy prior to being apprehended to cast any legal doubt on the ‘natural causes’ explanation. After that point, even if you can go on to prove that they could have saved the decedent if they had acted sooner, people are rarely held liable or punished for that.   This is certainly a problem to some degree in every LEO, big and small, but man, ICE in particular sure seems to have a heavy concentration of inhumane, cruel, bloodthirsty individuals.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-03T22:37:20,3
I think the heart stops beating is going to be their baseline for natural causes. There is absolutely no way the truth is going to come out on even how many people have actually died.  And I’m reminded of the John Oliver piece on Medical Examiners vs Coroners.   https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/20/john-oliver-medical-examiners-coroners-last-week-tonight,baldycoot,2025-05-04T06:54:10,1
