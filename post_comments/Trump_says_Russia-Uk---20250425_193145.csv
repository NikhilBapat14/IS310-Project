"Well I hope so, but I’m skeptical that both parties really want to make a deal at this point. For a zone of negotiation to be made, a lot has to be given to both.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-25T20:13:09,29
If Kremlin said it was constructive then I imagine Ukraine is going to lose everything they don't currently hold and no NATO membership. Basically everything Putin wanted when he started the war. Dictator invades and gets what he wants. Excellent negotiating and sends a clear message to our other adversaries like China and Iran.,specter491,2025-04-26T09:17:23,8
"I’m not the most informed on foreign policy, but what I worry about is Putin not respecting the terms. Putin has the “benefit” of not having to care about putting his country before his power it seems, a la Jinping.  I want nothing more than Trump to succeed and broker a deal, however Putin seems intent on tentatively agreeing then giving the middle finger days after.  I commented something similar in a past thread and the replies were largely sanction the shit out of Russia, but it feels like there’s hesitancy there from the administration? Am I missing something there?",Captain-Triangle,2025-04-26T09:06:14,3
The problem is the security guarantee.  Probably a jointly managed DMZ between NATO and Russia.,hiricinee,2025-04-25T22:34:10,7
"News trending currently.  *US President Donald Trump has said Russia and Ukraine ""are very close to a deal"", hours after his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks in Moscow.*  *Trump said it had been a ""good day"" of negotiations, while the Kremlin described the talks - which Ukraine was not present at - as ""constructive"".*  *Earlier, Trump said on social media that ""most of the major points are agreed to,"" and urged Russia and Ukraine to meet ""at very high levels"" and ""to finish it \[the deal\] off"".*  [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dj4402qejo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dj4402qejo)  Let's hope for the best.  EDIT: There we go. First downvotes.  Obviously from the same off-reddit people who love lecturing others, if they dared to risk embarassment by actually commenting that is, while clearly just wanting this war to continue indefinitely.",SlightWerewolf4428,2025-04-25T19:32:18,16
"I wonder if Trump can pull it off? If he does, it'll be a cold day in hell should he win the Nobel Peace Prize.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-25T19:49:00,0
Having dialogue with adversaries is a good thing. The left is recklessly prideful.,kaytin911,2025-04-25T20:29:17,0
The best thing is that there is a President in the White House that strives for peace.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-26T01:02:34,1
"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday (Apr 25) discussed the ""possibility"" of direct talks with Ukraine in a meeting with a US envoy, the Kremlin said, while United States President Donald Trump claimed the warring parties were ""very close to a deal"".

They just want the war to continue in hopes a liberal president gets the opportunity to end the war instead.,TD3SwampFox,2025-04-26T00:16:34,-5
"Indeed, if he manages to pull this off, the warmongers who spend all their time virtue-signaling rather than doing anything positive, will never forgive him for it.  EDIT: The brigading downvoters hate being called out.",SlightWerewolf4428,2025-04-25T19:56:24,2
"There's no chance. Leftist globalists control most of those. Obama got it for winning an election, being on the globalist team, and being of a certain race. Even he has said so because it happened before he did anything other than win.",kaytin911,2025-04-25T20:30:05,-10
