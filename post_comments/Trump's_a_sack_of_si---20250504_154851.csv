"Of course he has the red light Saber. In step wars lore the color of the light saber is from the crystal that effectively chooses you based on who you are as a person   Rule of two.  ‚ÄúThe origins and meaning of red lightsabers in Star Wars are deeply tied to power, aggression, and the unrelenting dominance of the Dark Side.   Red lightsabers are notorious in Star Wars as a weapon carried by the most villainous of characters, the Sith. These villains had one life purpose: to eliminate the Jedi Order and gain control as tyrants throughout the galaxy.  The Sith followed the rule of two , which dictated that there would be one master and one apprentice. The apprentice would cleanse themselves of all physical and mental shortcomings, in many cases being controlled by their master until their soul was broken. While this purpose uniformly united most Sith, there were many instances throughout history in which red lightsaber users, including Sith Lords, would stray from this common goal to pursue their own conquests.‚Äù  https://ultrasabers.com/holocron/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-red-lightsaber/?srsltid=AfmBOopcvpRNO8aTJgR9iWsd5ucDGOnRKtpqAH4Xpe7zBXlCrT_mWXlg",Oceanbreeze871,2025-05-04T16:44:05,11
