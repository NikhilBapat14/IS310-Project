> recession fears  Trump's going to make the Great Depression look like a minor recession by the time he's done.,llahlahkje,2025-04-30T09:37:25,8

We should stop calling “news” at stating the obvious.,cdistefa,2025-04-30T09:39:25,1

"I think that's the point. Isolate the US, create some kind of authoritarian situation, then start actually attacking and invading neighboring countries. Our leaders want to be just like Russia, but more successful at taking over the world.",0002millertime,2025-04-30T09:40:44,4
"""recession"" is just a definition... most economists define it as ""two consecutive quarters of declined economic activity, growth, downturn, etc...""  This reporting is just based on the first quarter... come back in another few months.. and it will get good  lol",Interesting_Rip_4748,2025-04-30T09:53:46,4
"No joke. I run a small side business and got slammed with tariffs this year. I used to order custom materials from abroad without issues, now I’m paying 30–40% more just to get the same stuff through customs. It's like death by a thousand cuts.",Kindly_Ingenuity5922,2025-04-30T14:55:38,2
Given that the US is closer to breaking up than falling into an authoritarian line I doubt this wet dream will ever happen.,FlyingRock,2025-04-30T09:42:52,5
"That’s exactly why I started pivoting to e-commerce. I was getting squeezed too hard importing stuff, so I figured if I can build something digital or US-based, I won’t be stuck at the mercy of these tariff swings.",Superflyscraper,2025-05-01T08:16:13,1
"Exactly. There are several different factions acting together to prop up Trump (Evangelicals, Billionaires, Racists, Foreign Adversaries, etc.) and their end goals overlap, but do not necessarily include the others. They know Trump is the means to their goals, but eventually they'll fight it out amongst themselves.",0002millertime,2025-04-30T09:51:55,3
"Big same. I moved to Printful  a few months ago, they produce and ship from the US, so no more customs nightmares or unexpected charges. It’s honestly been way smoother and cheaper.",EasternAggie,2025-05-01T08:21:12,1
That sounds promising. I will try it out and see if it works best for my business.,Superflyscraper,2025-05-01T08:25:25,1
