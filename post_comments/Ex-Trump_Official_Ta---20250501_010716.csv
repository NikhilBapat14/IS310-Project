"Keep in mind Chris Krebs was the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under Trump in his 1st term. Krebs said the 2020 vote was ""the most secure in American history"". For that statement Trump fired him because it became a problem for Trump's lie that the election he lost to Joe Biden was ""rigged"". Krebs was an obstacle for Trumps effort to overturn the 2020 election based on lies.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-01T01:38:12,28
