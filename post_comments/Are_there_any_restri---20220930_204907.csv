You can't be a member of two branches of government at the same time though some feel that part of the constitution isn't completely clear I think even this supreme court would not allow it.,[deleted],2022-10-01T10:33:39,9
"I mean, could you point to a specific line in the Constitution banning this behavior? Of course not. But it's much more complicated than that. There is no one in their right mind that would even attempt this. The Constitution is extremely explicit in the idea that the branches of government are designed to be separate, and anyone who is genuinely trying to interpret the Constitution cannot in good faith see this as an acceptable solution. Further, even if someone DID try, it's not clear that it would work--it would obviously get challenged legally and politically, and it would very likely be shot down in both of those arenas in overwhelming fashion.",mormagils,2022-10-03T09:50:54,1
Which part of the Constitution is that?,Arguss,2022-10-01T13:20:46,2
">There is no one in their right mind that would even attempt this.  I mean, we also thought no one in their right mind would suggest a direct violation of the Emoluments Clause by suggesting holding an official summit between countries at their golf resort. We thought no one would attempt to find a legal way to overturn a democratic election result in several states.  Clearly, a lot of tradition and custom is being violated at the moment, leaving only the hard restrictions set down in the actual laws. I'm asking from that point of view: If someone wanted to cynically centralize as much power in themselves as possible, what would actually be prohibited, rather than simply ""not done"" out of respect for the rule of law and tradition?",Arguss,2022-10-03T13:43:34,2
"Article 1, section 6, clause 2   ""No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments where I shall have been encreased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.""",Yggdrssil0018,2022-10-01T13:40:25,5
"Yeah, sure, I get we've already crossed a few ""beyond the pale"" kind of moments. But the reality is that no Constitution can have a clause that addresses every little thing that can possibly be addressed. This is why we have statutes and democratic norms that are held sacred, and this is why so many folks are currently talking about the threat to democracy that America is currently facing.  In other words, yes, you're giving examples of other situations that pushed the limits similarly that pretty much everyone who wasn't directly benefited by the actions knew were bad actions. In a functional democratic system, those things are actually prohibited even if there isn't a specific rule that can always be pointed to. I mean, we have an ACTUAL emoluments clause that DOES create a specific rule and someone still found a way to bend it/break it/simply ignore it.   Law isn't always about what is written. It's also about what is enforced. I would argue the Constitution is quite clear that you can't do this, that it is actually prohibited, because it would so clearly undermine the basic principles of separation of powers that are explicitly valued throughout the document. Language is inherently vague and people are inherently creative--there's no lock that can't be picked and no rule that can't be broken in all but name.  The point I'm trying to make is that you're being too legalistic. It doesn't really matter if there's a written rule because that wouldn't guard as well as you think it would and it we actually do have a rule against it with anyone who views the Constitution as a complete document that communicates specific concepts. The Constitution clearly separates the powers. That is explicit. This would clearly couple the powers. Sure, some people could argue it wouldn't and then could try to do it anyway using some nonsense reasons....but at a certain point it's acceptable to say ""no, that is just not an accurate reading of the Constitution citing the document as a whole.""",mormagils,2022-10-03T13:52:44,1
"I suppose there one has to decide whether the Speaker counts as a ""member"" of the House or not;  >The House of Representatives shall chuse \[sic\] **their Speaker and other Officers**; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.  That suggests the Speaker is an ""officer"" of the House, but is that the same as a ""member""?  I also found [this commentary](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C2-3/ALDE_00013138/), which says that historically courts have largely refrained from adjudicating on the issue, and even shied away from it in such a manner as to prevent most people from having standing to sue for such a violation.  Article 1, Section 2, Clause 1 says  >The House of Representatives shall be composed of **Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States**, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.  This suggests that the ""Members"" of the House of Representatives are the elected representatives, but not necessarily the Speaker (who coincidentally has been an elected member every time to the present day).",Arguss,2022-10-01T14:18:10,1
"I disagree with your analysis. I think the text the way the Constitution was written implies that it has to be a member of the house. ""The House of Representatives shall chuse their speaker and other officers"" is fairly direct because the subject here, ""The House of Representatives"" is a conditional limiting statement. There's no implication that a person outside the body can be chosen.  The same conditional limit applies to the Senate with choosing a president pro tempore.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-10-01T14:41:10,2
"I thought it was widely accepted that the Speaker could be someone from outside the House? Not that the Founding Fathers thought it *would* be, rather that they sort of left it open by accident, because they simply assumed it would be a member and didn't specify that in writing.  >""The House of Representatives shall chuse their speaker and other officers"" is fairly direct because the subject here, ""The House of Representatives"" is a conditional limiting statement.  Are all of the other officers of the House members of the House? I'm thinking here of the Sergeant at Arms, although I don't know if he counts as an ""officer"" of the House or not.  EDIT: There was [a bill proposed in 2021 by a Democrat](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/563758-democrat-unveils-bill-to-only-allow-house-members-to-serve-as-speaker/) to make it clear that the Speaker must be a member of the House, but it was never taken up.",Arguss,2022-10-01T14:51:31,1
"It's generally accepted, even by the official rule interpreters of the House, that the Speaker can be someone not in Congress.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/can-outsider-be-speaker-house-n441926",ProLifePanda,2022-10-03T09:03:46,1
"""could"" is the operative word.  House rules and tradition have made it nearly impossible to choose someone outside the House.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-10-04T08:16:17,1
