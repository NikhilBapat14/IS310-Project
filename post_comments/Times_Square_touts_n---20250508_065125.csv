Statue of someone with no name who's done nothing vs statues of highly accomplished people with historical names. Stark contrast indeed.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-08T06:56:42,1194
I’ve seen this post a few times on Facebook and the comment sections are all hysterical.  “Y’aLl cOnSeRvAtIvEs aRe OfFeNdEd!”  No. No we’re not. We just think it’s fucking stupid. Stop projecting.,Captain-Triangle,2025-05-08T07:45:55,378

How about a 12’ statue of a black American that accomplished something great. There are plenty to choose from. This is silly. I don’t recall seeing 13’ tall statues of no name white people in prominent places.,jeon2595,2025-05-08T09:28:07,140

">Statue of someone with no name who's done nothing...  A statue of an anonymous well-fed and cared-for New York woman in casual clothes who appears to stare at two statues of people of noted accomplishment, as well as the general public, like they owe her something, standing defiantly in the middle of a sidewalk, blocking people's progress...paid for with contributions from liberal organizations and a large amount of government money.
