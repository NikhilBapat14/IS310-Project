"The investigation was asking Israeli government agents for background and using their pull quotes?  Uh, maybe not that credible.  Functionally, I guess to protesters there isn't much difference between the previous administration *allowing* genocide and the current one *actively encouraging* it and requesting it go faster, but I would suggest to them that protesting AOC is really not all that helpful at this point.  I mean, I get the desire to protest people who *care*, which isn't anyone with actual power these days, but recognize when your methods are harming the people you're trying to help.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-05-05T20:59:56,4
"No shit.  It's beyond amusing to me to see the same people who were attacking folks last year for criticizing the Biden's administration's policies on Gaza (refusal to block military aid to Israel, false ""red line"" claims, refusal to sanction Israeli government officials, continuing to provide cover for Israel at the UN, threatening other countries over their policies toward Israel, blocking reports to Congress regarding Israel and humanitarian aid, defunding UNRWA, etc.) now all of a sudden seem to care about Gaza...when Trump is in office.  Yes, Trump is 100% worse on Gaza than Harris would have been and doesn't give a rat's ass about the Palestinians (he frankly doesn't care about Israelis, either), and Biden was better on this issue than Trump was, but it wasn't like Biden was some saint, either.",walkallover1991,2025-05-05T20:13:05,3

"This investigation was done by Channel 13 in Israel and translated by Drop Site News (https://bsky.app/profile/dropsitenews.com/post/3lnvbkrokvk2p)  >8/ “God did the State of Israel a favor that Biden was the president during this period, because it could have been much worse. We fought [in Gaza] for over a year and the administration never came to us and said, ‘ceasefire now.’ It never did. And that’s not to be taken for granted.”",KDLCum,2025-05-05T19:51:24,-2

"very few people did that. republicans have successfully splintered the party by convincing people like you that leftists, idealists lost the election for democrats. so for the past few months the party has been further splintering as centrists further attack and alienate the idealistic and passionate members of their party. this is how republicans secure a dynasty. this is republicans only hope in mid-terms, and it's working.   the fact is, the vast majority of leftists, protesters, idealists within in the party did in fact vote for harris.   harris had a stunted impromptu 4 month campaign, in a racist and sexist country a black woman received the 3rd highest vote amount in history, in the 2nd highest turnout in history. the support for harris, who was not a great candidate was historic. trump only won by 1.5%, that's less than hillary won the popular vote by in 2016.  there are a lot of reasons why harris lost. blaming it on leftists voters is idiotic and is exactly what republicans want you to do.",Virbillion,2025-05-05T20:59:40,13
By the time midterms roll around 18 months from now the economy will be so bad no one will care what Israel is doing.  ,vwf1971,2025-05-05T22:15:55,6
I mean...democrats could just listen to their base and work on denying weapons to Israel to stop the ongoing genocide.  That'd also help win the midterms,KDLCum,2025-05-05T21:30:19,1
"Biden lied and Harris repeated that lie to run cover so a country across the Atlantic Ocean could do live-streamed genocide.  They were willing to risk losing an election to Trump, a guy they correctly say is a severe threat to democracy, because they didn't wanna stop giving bombs to Israel  Now Trump is using this issue to jail and disappear people trying to do anti war protests",KDLCum,2025-05-05T21:27:23,5
"You said it, Trump won by less than 2 percent.  I’m not a Democrat, I’m an independent.  I hate both parties. And it’s this type of finger pointing that gave the presidency to a malignant narcissistic traitor to our country.  So, again, these distractions of whether Biden did enough for Palestine are effective for disenchanting voters due to “all parties are bad”.  They are, vote anyway",b_shert,2025-05-06T06:10:18,3
"100% this. Thanks.   Not to mention that Harris still would have lost even if she won every single Jill Stein vote. But for some reasons Centrists get angry and immediately change the subject the second you point that out.   Harris actually ran a fairly decent campaign with what she was given, and helped improve the margin Trump had over Biden by a decent amount. Her policies were shit, the consultant class running her campaign was shit, but overall she did a pretty good job.",walkallover1991,2025-05-05T21:56:44,4

Why isn't it accurate? They basically told the uncommitted movement to fuck off and lost Michigan because of it and came off as pro war,KDLCum,2025-05-05T21:31:55,5
"Yup. I'm a full blown socialist and I spent countless hours last year canvassing and working phone banks for Harris. But sure, keep alienating leftists like me and blame me for the problems in this country - that's a sure fire way to send the Dems on a path to victory!  Also, if the Democrats are the pro-Palestine party like so many centrists say there are, why have so few Democratic elected officials come out and condemned the plan to annex Gaza?",walkallover1991,2025-05-05T22:41:52,3

"I don't think the reason they lost was primarily due to Israel. Voters listed priorities were the economy, the border, and abortion. I think a larger issue with our media ecosystem is that we get trapped in echo chambers, and can be led to believe that everybody already knows and cares about xyz issue, which is just not the case",Intelligent-Time9911,2025-05-05T21:33:52,1

"You're right there were more issues, but this one was definitely a big one Harris should've broken off of Biden from. It was easy votes to win over.  The uncommitted movement, that specifically went to the primaries to vote uncommitted as a protest against Biden's Gaza policies, had 100,000 uncommitted votes in Michigan. Trump won Michigan by ~80,000 votes.   It was a very clear issue people cared about for obvious reasons. Instead of trying to win these easy votes, like with many issues, Harris refused to break away with Biden and say she'd do things differently. This overall attitude of not trying to win over every last vote is what lost the election and democrats seemingly haven't learned anything based on how they're talking about the AOC/Bernie tour",KDLCum,2025-05-05T21:45:03,4
"Comparing primary political stunts to a presidential election is very much apples to oranges, but I absolutely understand what you're saying. The problem that I think a lot of the pro-gaza crowd run into is that, for a lot of people who are struggling, hearing that people won't vote to help them over some war half a world away hurts. It hurts that it sucks up all of the oxygen in the room in progressive spaces. There's massive political stunts and tons of money and attention thrown at this war we aren't even a belligerent in, when women, black people, Hispanic people, and queer people are being trampled on. A lot of women especially, me included, feel justifiably grossed out when we see people who pick for their first priority something almost as far from us as it can be on earth when the crackdown on our rights has continued largely unabated. You're not going to win anyone to your cause by placing Gaza over people's bills, or their basic civil rights",Intelligent-Time9911,2025-05-05T21:51:26,4
"Gaza is an enormous and historic tragedy, but four years of Trump policies will potentially kill more people globally than even lived in Gaza before the war.  The cuts to USAID alone will probably do that.",ShaanitheGreen,2025-05-06T01:59:53,3
