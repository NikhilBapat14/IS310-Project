The DOJ is acting like the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press is a Biden-era policy. smh,JFJinCO,2025-04-28T11:43:28,23
"From the DOJ memo:  >Where a Government employee improperly discloses sensitive information for the purposes of personal enrichment and undermining ourforeign policy, national security, and Government effectiveness—all ultimately designed to sow chaos and distrust in Government - this conduct could properly be characterized as treasonous.”  Yo, uh and Hegseth?",jackytheblade,2025-04-28T11:45:03,16
"The original protections were implemented **""after the department** \[Biden's DOJ\] **disclosed several instances during the previous Trump administration where prosecutors secretly obtained records from several journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN as part of criminal leak investigations.""**  This is an attack on one of the main pillars of the constitution. Also a travesty of ""justice"" that trump's goons are going after the messenger, instead of investigating the trump admin's illegal release of classified information: Giving [Pentagon war plans](https://archive.ph/0cvkT) to [an espionage agent of China](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/404621/elon-musk-china-tesla-trump), and divulging [classified details over unsecured apps](https://archive.ph/eUO3U).  If rank and file government employees did this they'd be in jail for years, at minimum. trump's Department of Lawfare is instead focused on silencing and punishing whistleblowers and the free press, again.",charcoalist,2025-04-28T12:46:00,5
