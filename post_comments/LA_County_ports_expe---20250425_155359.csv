"Empty store shelves are coming!!  Those consumer goods that filled our malls, Walmart, Targets, medium, and small businesses are no longer importing goods since this tarrif fiasco started.   Markets to unstable and untenable to sell foreign made.   We're just now starting to see the first trickles. A lot of businesses got caught holding the bag with tarrifs going into effect after they committed/boated goods. Now they have to sell at loss in some cases!!  So many jobs will be lost, so many businesses will be shuttered.  Thanks, Trump!  Homegrown manufacturing to replace it all will take decades build.  Oh, and we've repulsed the sane world, goodbye tourism!",maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-25T15:58:45,28
" 1) Factory building has halted across America because it is now too expensive to build factories  2) Manufacturing is now moving out of the country because it is now more expensive to import parts, manufacture, then export the products  3) Nobody wants to invest in domestic manufacturing based on a value proposition that could disappear when trumbo changes his mind again  4) We have 4% unemployment. Who the hell is going to work for a $1 an hour?   5) We just deported our labor force. We don't have anyone to work the factories",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-25T16:53:04,23
