"He's nuts:  # On the Economy    **Scherer:** There’s talk on Wall Street of what they call a “Trump put,” meaning that there’s a bottom to how far the market will fall, because if we’re headed to a recession, you’ll change your tariff policy. If we’re headed to de-dollarization and bond interest rates are rising, you’re going to change your tariff policy to adjust for that. Is that a fair characterization, that you’re watching the markets and that you’re going to try and protect the American economy?  **Trump:** I don’t think so. I don’t see how I could possibly change, because I saw what was happening. I’ve been saying this for 35, 40 years: I’ve watched this country get ripped off by other nations, and I say “friend and foe.” And believe me, the friends are in many cases worse than the foe. Look, we lost trillions of dollars last year on trade with this guy \[Biden\], trillions of dollars. And every year, we lose trillions. Trillions, right? Hundreds of billions, but basically trillions; we went over the ledge into the *T* word. And I can’t imagine it’s sustainable to have a country that can lose that much money for years into the future.  And I felt somebody had to do something about it. And already, I have tariffs on cars, as you know, of 25 percent; tariffs on steel of 25 percent; tariffs on aluminum of 25 percent. I have a base tariff of 10 percent for everybody, for every country, and that’ll be changed. And a little bit of a misnomer: I have a lot of negotiations going on, but I don’t have to. I do that because I want to see how they’re feeling. But I’m like somebody that has a very valuable store and everybody wants to shop in that store. And I have to protect that store. And I set the prices.  And we’re gonna be very rich. We’re gonna make a lot of money. So I don’t think the answer is that it will affect me. It always affects you a little bit, but I don’t think—and certainly there’s no theory, like you say, that if it hits a certain number—I don’t know where it is today. How’s the stock market?  **Goldberg:** I don’t track it hour to hour.  **Trump:** Anybody know? Let’s see. Just give me the good news if it’s good.  **Leavitt:** It’s up. All green.  **Trump:** How much is it up?  **Leavitt:** Dow is up 419 points; NASDAQ’s up—  **Trump:** This is a transition period. It’s a big transition. I’m resetting the table. I’m resetting a lot of years. Not from the beginning, you know. Our country was most successful from 1850 or so to, think of this, from 1870—really, from 1870 to 1913. And it was all tariffs. And then some great genius said, “Let’s go and tax the people instead of taxing other countries.”  We were so successful that the president set up committees, blue-ribbon committees, on how to give away the money. We were making so much money. And then we went to an income-tax system after that. And by the way, they brought the tariffs back, and after the Depression started, you know, they liked to say, “Oh, tariffs caused—” I might as well get that little plug in, because the one thing they say, “Well, tariffs caused the Depression.” No, no, we went into the Depression. We were in there for a while and they said, “Maybe we could go back to tariffs and save it.” But that ship had sailed.",idkbruh653,2025-04-30T20:12:43,7
