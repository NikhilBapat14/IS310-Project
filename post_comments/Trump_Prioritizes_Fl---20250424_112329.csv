"Trump's first 100 days in power is due on 30 April 2025.  It's no secret that he wanted a Ukraine peace deal done by then. Unfortunately as he's surrounded himself with classic dictator appointed incompetent sycophants he won't achieve this.  He's now resorted to literally begging Russia via social media.  The international reputation of the USA is now in tatters with its allies.  The financial reputation of the USA is now in tatters with its investors.  The political reputation of the USA is now in tatters due to the integrity of its President.  Going to be fun to watch how he spins the first 100 days as the ""Best ever for any President"". Which is what he will claim.",_L_R_S_,2025-04-24T11:27:20,20
"Sure he's been Russia's bitch since being inaugurated. But at least his morning he tweeted ""Vladimir, Stop"".   Trump is an absolute joke",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-24T11:28:53,8

"It's alredy way past flirting, Putin's cock is buried so deep in Trump's ass that it almost comes out through the mouth.",Venturis_Ventis,2025-04-24T11:34:40,4
"He never wanted peace.  He just wants a “win”, even if that means handing Russia victory.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-24T11:53:30,6
"This is insane. As President of the United States he is maybe 1 of very few leaders who can actually call Putin directly and tell him to stop, threaten him with punishment. Instead he's acting like a powerless broke civilian with no leverage hoping Putin sees his tweets. ",Deep-Ad9239,2025-04-24T11:53:45,4
He’s got a crush. He just can’t quit him.,MakeSense1247,2025-04-24T12:14:08,3
It goes beyond admiring dictators. Trump is terrified of Putin.,westdl,2025-04-24T12:50:22,2
Maybe Trump should hit Putin with a barrage of tweets on Truth Social to let Putin know he is serious.  What a weak ass piece of crap we have for President.  He is a coward hiding in a fat suit.,Lott4984,2025-04-24T13:29:11,2

It’s not that. It’s more like a dom/sub sexual fawning for Putin. It’s far more pseudo sexual than fearful.,-Gramsci-,2025-04-24T14:36:35,3
He doesn't have to. Currently if a Russian soldier walks across another countries border and plants a flag the USA claim that is now sovereign Russian territory.  So all it needs is a Russian trawler to pull into Dutch Harbor with a flag and a portable pole!,_L_R_S_,2025-04-24T11:40:44,5
