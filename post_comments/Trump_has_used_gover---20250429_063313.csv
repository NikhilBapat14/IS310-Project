That number is a few hundred million low. 47 is taking out retribution on ALL USA CITIZENS.  Retribution against those who voted against him in 2020.  Retribution against those who did not vote for him in 2020.  Retribution against those who voted for him in 2020 -- because they clearly did not actually support him the way they should have: else he would have Won.  But 47 the king of losers lost and wants the entire world to pay for his hurt bully feewings.,stillonrtsideofgrass,2025-04-29T18:36:07,1

"The only saving grace is that he's a dimwit.  If a semi-intelligent individual was in his role, slashing taxes on the poor, explaining to the Billionaires that it was a case of donating their funds to the state coffers or enjoying an invitation to self-deletion or a cold dawn and a single cigarette, providing affordable housing and mandating living wages we'd have no shot at an election ever again.  However, the selfish greedy pig has antagonized 60% of the USA in 100 days.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-29T13:07:25,2
