"The SCOTUS ruling is temporary until the case can be heard, and only applies to using the Alien Enemies Act, so deport them under normal rules.  If they need to go in front of deportation judges, appoint a bunch of them to hear cases 24/7/365.  No delays.",mdws1977,2025-04-20T09:10:21,56
">\> The Supreme Court is [siding with illegal aliens now](https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/supreme-court-blocks-new-deportations-of-of-venezuelans-under-18th-century-wartime-law-alien-enemies-act/?utm_campaign=nypost&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social). The court is lost, the “Justices” are not protecting the rights of Americans, they are siding with our enemies.  For as much as the Democrats are losing public opinion for siding with Chele or Cholo or whomever, we'll lose people if we continue this kind of hyperbole.  The Supreme Court stopped any further deportation flights for illegal aliens being removed under the AEA, a 225+ year old law of dubious constitutionality.  This seems prudent, given the various court cases, overreach by judges, questions about standing and jurisdiction, hyperbole by the ACLU, and perhaps even admitted ""administrative mistakes"" being made by the administration.  Let's see where this goes.  In the meantime, actual deportations are not stopped.  Just this type of deportation based on alleged gang membership.  Let's get back to doing the actual work.",j3remy2007,2025-04-20T09:01:13,81
"“First off, people need to go to town halls Democrats are hosting across the country and publicly demand to know where these Democrats fall, with illegal alien gang members or with Americans?”  Knowing how Dems operate, one of two things would happen:  1. They call for everyone dissenting to be removed from the room by security  2. They just declare the town hall over and leave early, ignoring everyone and any questions because they don’t want to deal with a hostile audience in attendance",ITrCool,2025-04-20T08:32:03,2
I wish.  Why is it that almost no one is stepping up on the Liberal side to offer their homes?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-20T11:35:38,1
I fully support using taxpayer funds for Congress to fly to El Salvador and virtue signal the benefits of bringing terrorists into our country.  That would be a one-way ticket,vegatx40,2025-04-20T08:54:26,-2

Unfortunately, with illegal aliens and some of those who are ardent criminals!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T10:02:18,-7
"Exactly. They are illegal and criminal, deport because they are illegal. Go through the normal deportation process with whatever additional resources are necessary to have the courts and judges necessary.  Eliminate the virtue signaling sideshow and faux outrage about criminals not having due process, just deport like any illegal.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-20T10:27:26,18
"Most of these already have deportation orders, so ""due process"" has already been applied.  Those that don't, takes 5 minutes, no papers = deported.     Also, the main crux WRT the Venezuelan deportations comes from an EO by Joe Biden pausing deportations now unable to be undone by another EO by Donald Trump.",docholiday999,2025-04-21T09:01:21,3

"AEA has been held up as constitutional several times, even when FDR used it to arrest & deport German, Italian and Japanese nationals/immigrants after Pearl Harbor (the terrible Japanese internment camps were different, as per FDR's EO 9066).  As per the SCOTUS order, dubious would be the best thing to describe it: came out at midnight without any time given to the defendant for response or any other consideration.  If anything, deportation based on gang affiliation is the easiest to process and execute, as those gang affiliations are well documented from US and foreign partner LEOs.  Most have existing deportation orders (multiple in the case of the ""Maryland Man"") that can be carried out immediately.  SCOTUS can be told to pound sand.",docholiday999,2025-04-21T09:07:45,5
