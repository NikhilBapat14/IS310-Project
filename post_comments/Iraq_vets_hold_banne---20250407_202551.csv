There are Latinos that support Trump. I don't understand that.  There are gays that support Trump. I don't understand that.  There are women that support Trump. I don't understand that either.  But the one group of supporters that absolutely blow my mind are veterans. How in the living fuck do you not see how much Trump despises veterans?,Banned_Opinions,2025-04-08T06:35:25,11
