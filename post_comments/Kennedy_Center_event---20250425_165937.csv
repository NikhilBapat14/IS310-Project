"I would like to personally congratulate all the reddit ""useful idiots"" who parroted the ""they don't care about LGBT adults, they just don't want it in schools"" lie a few years ago and told us LGBT people were just over reacting.  Good job!!!!",CHKN_SANDO,2025-04-25T21:16:28,22

"sadly not a surprise üôÑ I bet they‚Äôre gonna do something really bad in June. They repealed dei in February (I think), made scary comments and plans about neurodivergent people here in April , oh and in March the save act which would suppress women‚Äôs rights‚Ä¶? I am predicting in June they‚Äôll do something very homophobic and scary as well, if not sooner üò¨!! Each month that has minority pride, they give us the ‚Äúgift‚Äù of something seriously awful that can domino effect into a loss of rights.  This literally is no conspiracy theory. I mean, they keep saying exactly what they‚Äôre gonna do. I‚Äôm so tired.",hopefulocto,2025-04-25T23:31:56,3

Really all they could do without changing the actual law or doing something illegal that would lose in court is repeal the SCOTUS decision which would let individual states return to refusing to marry same sex couples.  He‚Äôs rapidly running out of executive orders he can repeal to claim he did something and his new ones are starting to be ruled as illegal and unenforceable in court.,Deep_Alps7150,2025-04-26T02:13:03,1
