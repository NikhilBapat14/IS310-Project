"The US Supreme Court told him they were just last month. It's not open to debate.  Every single Supreme Court Justice agreed with this. Directly from the Court's [per curium decision:](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf)  ‚ÄúIt is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law‚Äù in the context of removal proceedings.

Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950).
