Same goes for the corporate executives who obsess about their ""lazy"" workers that don't occupy the C-Suite working from home since they can't personally watch over them to make sure they look busy or have their direct reports do it even though they rarely bothered to physically be in the office for large periods of time even before COVID.   Even decades before technology enabled people to work from anywhere, the upper management at companies would spend loads of time at high priced boozy ""lunches"" that took up half the day, golf outings or other fancy corporate events in the name of making business deals (which I'm sure was occasionally true). These days though, they are much more likely to travel large distances to go on even more elaborate outings for long periods of time or indefinitely thanks to technology while simultaneously complaining about lower level staff doing the same even for conferences or training seminars for the sake of ""cost savings"".",williamfbuckwheat,2025-05-04T07:57:00,18

Adderall comes in high doses, doctors don't get in trouble for prescribing it, and it's socially acceptable.

The best, most successful and egregious offenders of hypocrisy are the most clever at disguising it.  All hypocrisy should be addressed because it reveals chinks in the armor of curated narratives.  You don't see the significance of knowing if someone is actually doing the thing they tell you you're a bad person for doing?  Example Gavin Newsom mandating COVID protocols and then gets caught on camera at a restaurant not wearing a mask during a lockdown.  Rules for thee, not for me.

If you accept character assassination as valid, then you have no grounds to complain when it is done to someone you actually like.   So don't be a hypocrite.
