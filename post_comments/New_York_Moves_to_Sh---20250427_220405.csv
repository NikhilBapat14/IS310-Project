Institutional investors are holding on to the stock and making small selective buys to keep the price high. Elon has been using Tesla stock as his own private currency and so much money is tied up in it that it's too big to fail.

"The reality is most (all?) legacy automakers support the dealer model because managing wholesale-like distribution is a lot easier and more efficient for them than setting up their own retail/direct-to-consumer platforms. The amount of time and money it would cost them to prop up such a network on their own would add quite a bit to their overhead. It's the same reason they buy wiring harnesses and suspension components and tires and all kinds of other parts from suppliers.  But... even if they did fire up their own direct sales network, it's not likely you would see any savings, anyways. They'd be doing it to protect/increase their margins, not to lower prices for you.

"Not quite. Car dealership owners are one of the largest blocks of heavy and reliable Republican donors. Making it more difficult for car companies to sell direct to customers without dealers will strengthen the local political power of a group of people that is heavily anti-Democrat, and donates heavily especially to local and state elections.   Elon and Tesla are not the only new EV startup type automaker that would benefit from being able to sell direct to customers, and it would likely help Democrats more longer term if the power of car dealerships could be reduced.  And customers could benefit from lower prices if they weren’t paying for a middleman dealer’s profit margin.",kancamagus112,2025-04-27T23:38:52,16

"I heard a different argument, that the laws were written to protect dealerships. Before WW2, a company like Ford couldnt take the risk to set up stores and maintenance in all the locales they wanted to sell their product in. They made dealer arrangements where the dealer took the risk (and the dealer is more familiar with the local scene to know what would sell well and to whom)   After WW2, returning soldiers had money to buy cars, and in an effort to protect dealerships from the manufacturers (which now because of the exponential number of people who could buy cars  reduced the risk of opening their own store), many states wrote laws saying that manufacturers could not sell directly and have to go through dealerships   The exact wording is different per state, which is why Tesla behaves differently per state.   As for why they were exempt from the dealership rule, in the places they are exempt, its not exclusive to them; other EV-only makers enjoy the same privilege.   As an example, in Oregon, manufacturers are allowed to sell directly to consumers if they have not established a dealer relationship. It's why Honda or Mercedes can't sell direct, but Tesla and Rivian can",r7RSeven,2025-04-28T05:02:59,5

"To protect the consumer from far scummier car manufacturers.   Forcing sales through dealerships protects competition in the market. One dealership may focus on customer service, while another may focus on price. In each case, you’re free to go to another dealership and get a different experience.   Allowing direct sales just returns the power to the car manufacturer, and we can see the results in Tesla. How many people paid for Full-Self-Drive and have received it? How many upgrades are never going to be installed?",dacommie323,2025-04-27T23:19:19,6
"It's basically franchise protection laws, which we have for certain products. The argument behind them is that it's unfair competition for a manufacturer to get franchisees to do all the leg work in advertising and establishing the infrastructure in local markets (like delivery and service stations etc) only for the manufacturer to then swoop in and tell the franchisees' customers to cut the middlemen who did all the hard work and buy direct instead. There are these laws in place for cars because GM tried to do exactly that 100 years ago and everyone agreed that GM was the scummy ones in that scenario.  Tesla won the legal battle to sell direct when they started out because they argued that they never had any dealers so they wouldn't be screwing over any franchisees. As a result now some states have amended their laws to say a car company can sell direct, but only if they've never had any dealership sell their cars in the state.",filthysize,2025-04-27T23:25:05,3

"I don't buy this. The competition lies in being able to choose between different manufacturers. You can also have independent repairs shops outside of dealers, which exist, so have the manufacturer sell directly doesn't eliminate multiple options for repairs.  The dealers exist because the manufacturers wanted to be car manufacturers and didn't want to deal with the actual selling to customers part. It's super common in other industries as well. Hell, you don't buy groceries directly from a cereal maker, you go through a dealership aka grocery store.  Having one dealer per automotive brand eliminates one of the main benefits of a dealer, sharing a sales branch across industries and lowering costs for multiple manufacturers. They would want to carry across different car types to avoid competition within itself.",ocelotrev,2025-04-27T23:37:01,1
