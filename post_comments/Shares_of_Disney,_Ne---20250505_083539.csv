I wonder what his scam is this time?    Trump doesn't do ANYTHING unless there's a built-in scam where he and his buddies can steal a bunch of money somehow.,--John_Yaya--,2025-05-05T08:44:15,47
The revolutionaries were sick of King George and his tariffs. I also recall them not liking King George's sporadic policy changes and dubbed him mad. Odd that the Trump crowd like to pretend that they have the same ideals as our revolutionary predecessors.,black_flag_4ever,2025-05-05T09:20:33,36
"A lot of ""American Films"" use VFX freelancers and VFX studios that are located overseas, and there aren't enough American based artists to take over that work in the blink of an eye. This would severally delay or outright kill most on going movie projects from Hollywood studios. This wouldn't just affect MCU-style big budget films, but streaming and mid-level releases too as VFX aren't just giant robots fighting but also stuff like color grading scenes that audiences don't normally notice. The only movies left untouched would be low budget shlock starring Kevin Sorbo.  Also, if this extends to TV and streaming, this would kill BBC programming, K-dramas, and the entire Anime industry in America. It would be impossible to turn a profit on those licenses unless you also want to increase subscription prices by a significant amount.  A lot of people have taken pride in not being politically engaged over the past decade.

"I’m not sure if this would even fall under the scope of a tariff.  It would be like tariffing a book because the writer was in another country when it was written, even if it was published by a US company.  A tariff would apply potentially to movies where the physical copy of a movie was sold from overseas, or maybe if a digital copy was sourced from an overseas company, but basing in the location of the movie falls way outside that scope and just makes it a ‘tax’ which means it has to be approved by Congress.    I’m not sure how you’d even track or enforce that, it would be quite cumbersome.  What if you included a single shot that was a photograph taken in another country?  Would that count?",Gogs85,2025-05-05T08:58:37,18
