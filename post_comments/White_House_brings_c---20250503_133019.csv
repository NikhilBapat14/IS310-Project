"How are we in a situation where the wealthiest country in the world has just turned into a meme in a few months? I‚Äôm not saying they were perfect before Trump, but the fall has been sudden and dramatic.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-03T13:33:20,81

"I work for a man in his early 80s. You‚Äôd probably never know by the looks of it. He is sharp, Pilates everyday, confidentially running a successful midsize firm. But‚Ä¶ sometimes I‚Äôm doing some crazy shit. He is just out of touch enough. It‚Äôs usually archaic at the least. Ego driven at the worst. But that‚Äôs my job.  My honest question is: how much of this shit is just ‚Äúmy job‚Äù? Because an ‚Äúinfluencer briefing‚Äù sounds like something an 80 year old man thinks up.",Cotedivore_captain,2025-05-03T14:52:28,-2

I think what's happened in America will actually be a good thing for the rest of the world. Many countries were sliding in the  wrong direction with influences coming from the same places that got Trump elected.  People's minds have been refocused and the right are getting a kicking all over.,AwkwardBet7634,2025-05-03T17:04:04,5
"The Australian labour party won after the liberals (it‚Äôs confusing but the liberals are the right wing) specifically stated they wanted Australia to follow the Trump model.  They lost spectacularly and their leader, Peter Dutton even lost his own seat.",AltruisticHopes,2025-05-03T17:29:59,2
Conservatives had the largest popular vote share since the 80s.  Let‚Äôs not pretend like Trump obliterated the right.  He just forced the left and centrist to vote centrist instead of vote splitting.  Conservative ideology is still strong in Canada.,ragemaw999,2025-05-04T07:41:44,0
