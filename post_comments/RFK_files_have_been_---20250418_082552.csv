"How do people not get this.  Anyone who has the power to release those, holds power over all the people implicated.  Full stop. Assume it's a 50/50 split of dems and replublicans because we can't know otherwise... Trump can use them to control his agenda for four years and hopefully throw a hand grenade if President Vance loses 2028 election.   But to use it now, would possibly derail his entire term because it could be so many people it causes a consitutional crisis.  It's a corruption nuclear option. If you're say... Bill Clinton, and you're about to go down for the crimes we all know you committed... Maybe you get the idea to save yourself by throwing Hillary under, or Obama, or Schumer or Pelosi... And maybe they get the same idea and that gets McConnell (hopefully) or etc etc etc.  It's a blackmail cold war.  BEST POSSIBLE CASE... Trump holds it, uses it to advantage... And pulls the pin either when these people are no longer necessary or on a really rainy day.  But I can promise you it isn't coming out tomorrow, and that likely in all reality you don't actually want it to if you could inspect all timelines.",FourtyMichaelMichael,2025-04-18T12:55:57,30
