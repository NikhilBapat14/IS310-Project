"""Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal.""  - ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell - Chapter 7, Page 38.",MiffyKitty,2025-04-30T11:08:20,33

"***From Rolling Stone’s Asawin Suebsaeng and Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  *""It’s like a toddler lying about drawing marker all over the walls,"" one former Biden spokesperson tells Rolling Stone.*  Markets open with a selloff on Wednesday in response to another wave of negative economic projections fueled by President Donald Trump’s global tariff war. According to a Wednesday report from the Department of Commerce, GDP fell 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first time the economy has contracted since 2022. Meanwhile, inflation indicators are accelerating and wage growth is decreasing.  The Dow Jones dropped over 600 points in response to the news, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each dropped over two percentage points. The president — who for years has treated stock market performance as a direct reflection of his popularity — was not having it.  “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” the president wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. “I didn’t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.”  Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-blames-biden-tariff-economy-dip-1235328425/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-blames-biden-tariff-economy-dip-1235328425/)",rollingstone,2025-04-30T11:07:54,5

I appreciate that you are 98% on the same side as me but I think the remaining 2% might be significant. Animal farm is about the Soviet Union, and the CIA funded a movie based on the book and made sure that this book is taught in every public school in America. Orwell was “anti-Stalinist” in the same way all social democrats are. I think you should look into the historical role that social democrats and democratic socialists have played when fascism has been on the rise in the past (the Soc dems teamed up with the Nazis to prevent communists from taking power in the Weimar Republic, leading to the most horrific fascist regime history has produced so far).

"Step 1: Calm down. I am not attacking you, I am attacking the ideas that you are repeating. Step 2: I think everyone in this sub should educate themselves on the worldwide struggle for the working class and how fascism is connected to it. The SPD opposed the communists in Germany and the elected SPD president appointed Hitler to the chancellorship and dissolved the Reichstag so that the Nazis could rule by decree in the face of the reichstag fire. The Nazis killed social democrats after that but that does not erase the part the SPD played in hitlers rise to power.  I am sincerely not trying to troll anyone, I just want people to understand history and which groups contribute to which outcomes. Orwell was also given funding by the OSS (precursor to the CIA), just like Mussolini was a socialist before he received funding from MI6. The reason these people were funded is because their message was valuable for redirecting left revolutionary energy into either fascism (in Mussolini’s case) or general complacency in the case of Orwell.   Again, I’m not doing this just try and prove myself right and others wrong, I would like everyone to understand what we are actually up against and who is responsible for it, and what it means to get rid of fascism once and for all.
