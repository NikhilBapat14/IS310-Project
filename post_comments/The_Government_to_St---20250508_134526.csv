"Just like Covid, if you don't test, you don't get any positives!  Republican-led states are selfish enough not to care about disasters when they happen to someone else, even their neighbors. Eventually the leopards may come for their faces, but that's in the future, and these folks don't really care about that.  Do consequences matter if the people involved don't recognize them?",Orwells_Roses,2025-05-08T13:50:18,7

"That’s just straight up avoiding accountability. If you don’t track the costs, it’s easier to pretend nothing is happening or that it’s not a big deal. Just makes things worse in the long run",ModernnMuse,2025-05-08T14:00:41,4

DeSantis and the other red states thinks this will make insurance and HOA rates go down by hiding the numbers..? That's fucking hilarious. Thankfully they will be tracking chemtrails instead.,williamgman,2025-05-08T14:10:21,3
"Just think all the money this is going to save when extreme weather can't cost us any more money.  No tracking means it doesn't exist, right?  Why didn't anyone else ever think of this?",uhohnotafarteither,2025-05-08T14:34:58,3
