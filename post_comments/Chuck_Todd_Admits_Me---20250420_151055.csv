"Trump is a contradiction.  Seems dumb but always seems to be in the right place at the right time and things tend to work out well for him.  Seems like he can't control his mouth, yet every unfriendly outlet clings on his every word.  What kills these MSM outlets is the fact that what kills them also sustains them.  Liberals would rather hate watch CNN/MSNBC/The View, which is 99.9% whining about Trump at this point, than risk turning the channel and getting some alternative takes.  The media understands this and gives the babies their candy.  Sane people in the middle or on the moderate right look at that and know intuitively Donald Trump is a very small percentage of what happens in the world.  Yet he is 99.9% of what these outlets talk about.  Their obsession with him was their undoing.  Had they pledged a media blackout of him post Jan 6th he would be long forgotten at this point.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-20T15:40:26,29
"I have never been a big Trump fan. I have found him too abrasive and egotistical on the public stage.   That being said, he has taken action on a hundred different issues that US elected officials have been wringing their hands and moaning about for decades without actually taking action.   Will the executive measures and tariffs work out? Time will tell but at least heâ€™s doing something different.",Sicks-Six-Seks,2025-04-20T16:05:43,22
"Bridget Phetasy had an old joke about this going back to the first Trump presidency.  Something about how he was by default a ""job creator"" because left wing media was about to die etc...  I ruined her joke but I'll leave with Homer Simpson: ""it's funny because it's true"".",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-20T17:02:58,8
Biden spent four years getting liberals to buy electric cars. In two months time Trump has them scrambling to get rid of them. Yeah Trump knows what he's doing.,bulldog522002,2025-04-20T22:48:59,2
">What kills these MSM outlets is the fact that what kills them also sustains   The only thing sustaining LameStream media is folks not willing to really get their news from other media.  Having said that, Donald is the most watchable person on the planet - in a sense.  He was drawing mega TV ratings before he even ran for president.  > Their obsession with him was their undoing.  Their biased attacks speeded up their destruction.  Technology moves on from old school media.  Radio took over the telegraph, TV took over radio, and cable took over TV- and rinse and repeat.  It's now social media's turn.  Who knows what's next.  ðŸ‘€",GiediOne,2025-04-20T20:41:05,4
