"This government is assaulting Democracy and striving for authoritarianism under the guise of immigration enforcement. Does anyone still need convincing? These demons have a fascist agenda and are supported by those who claim to be the very definition of patriotic. They are not patriots. They are nationalists. Nationalism is a bad thing. It means we‚Äôre not welcome because we don‚Äôt fit a distorted nationalist ideal of what they believe is a ‚Äútrue American‚Äù That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve started playing with the notion of deporting citizens and stripping people of their rights. No court trial for immigrants translates to no court trial for anyone they deem unworthy. That‚Äôs why everyone needs to be allowed due process. Carrying out their assault on Habeus Corpus is their most serious offense yet. If there is no impeachment, this administration must be overthrown. Let‚Äôs not forget it‚Äôs in the armed services oath to defend the constitution and they have an obligation to defy illegal orders.",Flat-Emergency4891,2025-05-10T08:43:01,5

"This is serious folks. If they do suspend habeus corpus, even if just for deportation cases, do you think they‚Äôll ever reinstate it? I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôll just expand their new power to jail anyone they want to. I fear you are teetering on the edge.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-10T12:05:56,1

"Honestly you guys need to stop making jokes and act before this asshole starts deporting American citizens for criticizing Trump or being gay.

If there was any doubt left in your mind about this administration being fascists here's your final clue.¬†   This leaves no doubt that they are full on fascists.

"yes, this will probably end in blood. What you have to understand, is that people have been surviving on shoestring budgets for a while now, because EVERYTHING in the USA is so expensive.  They don't have time, or if they have time they don't have the health, to try to act. At the nation-wide level. So things are only at this stage because people are still focusing on trying to survive.  It is only once people can't survive, that things are going to turn...ugly.",ragingreaver,2025-05-10T13:26:11,1

"The inability to put food on the table. That is what it is going to take. American culture is all about ""toughing it out"" and only once people quite literally CAN'T ""tough it out"" will things change.  Most of this nation is not on Reddit. Half this nation just wants to watch soap operas and listen to whatever came on America's Got Talent. They just...don't know how all of this works, and simply believe whatever it is POPULAR to believe, or whatever happens to be an issue on a month-by-month basis.  THAT is why the true fight going on this whole time has been the Culture War. EVERYTHING that Trump and Co. has been doing, has been in service of the Culture War first and foremost.  NOBODY ELSE likes the Culture War, because much of it is dumb and stupid and is getting in the way of, well, EVERYTHING. But for Republican leadership/donors, it was ALWAYS about the Culture War, has always BEEN about the Culture War...  ...and yes, we might very much lose our nation over it. Because the people most able to do something about it, don't want to engage with it.",ragingreaver,2025-05-10T13:40:37,1
