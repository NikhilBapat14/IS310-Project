"Quashed *yet.*  But he resigned out of protest and basic principles.   >Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”   Plus, not ""pulling punches"" against Trump is not their only limitation. Stories in general can piss him off. He already said CBS should ""pay a big price"" for their stories on Ukraine and Greenland that apparently equals going after him. He called on the FCC to impose maximum fines and punishment “for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”  It was literally only a matter of time before content was actually pulled.   Paramount has no business suddenly scrutinizing their content, except for to make sure nothing is run that would piss off Trump. The head of Paramount, Shari Redstone, and who benefits to make billions from the merger, already told the board she planned to settle Trump's meritless and ludicrous $10b lawsuit for the Harris interview just to please him for the merger approval.
