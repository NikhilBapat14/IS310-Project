"I'm still getting into arguments here on Reddit with people who think I'm being hyperbolic when I say that this has already become a fascist state.   When people here talk about kicking out the GOP in the 2026 election, and I tell them we're not going to have a free and fair 2026 election there are many people among us on Reddit who think I'm crazy.¬† But everyday, the number of people who think it' crazy talk dwindles.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-25T07:46:16,3
