"Just to remind everyone and inform those who aren't aware, presidents don't have the authority to impose tariffs in the first place. He's illegally usurping that power from Congress under the guise of ""national security.""

">“It’s a big mistake, in my view, when you have 7.5 billion people that don’t like you very well, and you’ve got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they’ve done,” he added.  How this isn't INCREDIBLY self-explaining and obvious to every single living being is, to me, mindblowing. This is what happens when you raise your people with unquestionable, unapologetic patriotism. Narcissism, lack of compassion, no capabilities of empathy, refusing to self-criticise, the list goes on...       America is truly about to FAFO. They are finally about to find out what the rest of the world has always thought about them (the stereotypical loud/selfish ones, that is), as the consequences of their actions come right back to smack them down.

"He didn't ""take down"" the president; the president is still up there.    As I said in another thread, I'm really fed up with these headlines that say that somebody bashed, smashed, took down, demolished, embarrassed, destroyed, shredded, guttted, ripped, or otherwise adversely impacted Trump.  These little rhetorical gestures have absolutely no effect on Trump. He's probably not even aware of them. He blissfully continues whatever it is he's doing unaffected by them.   **We** are the ones being demolished destroyed gutted and smashed by Trump's administration.   More proof that action speaks louder than words. And yet so far the opposition to Trump only has words, no action.     I've been seven protests so far and I've never seen anything at them except words.   I read about dozens of court rulings against Trump but when Trump ignores the judge's words, no action follows them up. Trump has action. We just have words.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T18:03:34,36

Violent crime is down a staggering amount and yet, they act as though we've never been worse off as far as crime is concerned.  People committing crimes yields punishment they yearn to dole out, keeps prisons staffed, and legally maintains a lower class of citizen that they can use as wage slaves or fodder for labor.  It's not some massively guarded secret that the main driver of crime is socioeconomic. This is why the US's soft power with foreign aid especially in developing nations is so important.

We all need to understand that China has various technologies available that are in demand. The answer of the West and Trump especially is to cling to fossile fuels, throw some money at tech companies that are apparently already losing the game of AI and ""bring back manufacturing"" which is a project no one has yet fully explained, while in the end this is in competition with a Chinese government that just implements one 5-year-plan after another.   So, we really have just witnessed Trump doing to America what he has done to all his other businesses. China is going to outcompete America, definitively in countries of the global South and even in the West, the US is quickly losing ground and in the long-time cannot offer the products that the West demands. China for example has a lot of problems Western countries has, like an aging population -- all China has to do is to build products like robots to solve their own demographic problems and they immediately have an export market in all of Europe as an export market. This cannot be prevented, it's just going to happen, and the strategy of Trump and his followership is to just end trade with the world, keep products locked out of the market and make the own population suffer from inflation, which can lead nowhere productive. It's just a historic wrong decision that has been made, and maybe can be reversed in parts, but if followed through, it would be the end of the US and the allies that don't jump ship.",gingerbreademperor,2025-05-04T04:50:19,1

But this quickly became a ""Well how can *I* know if I was blessed with this overabundance of grace by predestination?"" and the answer that the church largely fell into was ""Well, if you're super rich and successful, you're probably blessed, right? God must be thumbing the scale for you which means you're clearly graced, the proof is in the pudding"" which before too long became ""Well if you're super rich and especially charitable towards the Church, you're surely blessed and I'll let everyone know that.... loudly..."". Eventually, the latter morphed into indulgences and the like.   Now that's a huge oversimplification of course since it covers over a thousand years, but, yeah this idea of Grace being one of the primary determinants of your relationship with god and the likelihood of getting into heaven.... and that the best way to determine whether someone had grace was their fortunes in mortal life, and how charitable they were with those fortunes towards the church leaders in particular...",Ferelar,2025-05-03T21:40:28,152

"Yeah, sadly things have strayed quite a lot. Some of it happened early, some of it happened due to intentional syncretism trying to appeal to local rulers and make converting more appealing, and some of it happened bit by bit over a couple millennia. But yeah, your exact question is a lot of what formed the religious struggles of the Protestant Reformation (and before too, like the Hussite Wars- and that came on the tail of the Avignon Papacy period, where there were 2-3 popes!).   It's a pretty fascinating subject honestly, if one goes in with an open mind and cares more about history and sociology than about faith, to track the changes in Christianity/Catholicism. There were hundreds if not THOUSANDS of splinter sects, some with wildly divergent beliefs and some with almost identical beliefs but with one change (which we might even consider a minor change nowadays). But what they had in common is that all ""heresy"" tended to be considered a challenge to papal rule and the church leaders expected it to be dealt with in an extremely brutal fashion. If a ruler failed to do so, perhaps it meant they were a wicked ruler, or perhaps one who did not have grace... and such a rumor might turn a rulers subjects against them (or at least provide the necessary cover needed to MAKE a move against them).  In a time where nobles were said to be a different type of human with noble blood and a divine right to rule granted by God, being denounced, shamed, or in the worst cases excommunicated... well, suddenly your divine right is in question.   Anyways, it shows how the church was able to influence politics both directly and indirectly and how, being mortal men, they were very much open to corruption and influence themselves. I'm not particularly religious, but if the church stuck to its original teachings I might even be interested. I've met some absolutely wonderful religious individuals in my life, caring and would go out of their way to help, no matter the context. But I've also met some bigots, condescending malevolent bigots who used their faith to convince themselves that whatever they did was OK, maybe even ordained by God. And I find most *religions* as a whole trend towards the latter, even if many of the individual people therein are decent.",Ferelar,2025-05-04T08:18:45,2
"Like every organization, it eventually became about sustaining the organization of ""the church"" over the actual core mission. The poor have nothing to donate, and if you get them too riled up you're liable to piss off the powerful. It's way easier and more profitable to cozy up to the rich and powerful.

"Of course, it is present in every religion and frankly with the way most religions are set up it always WILL eventually become present. Corrupt people within the church will always have more resources, clout, and sway by nature of being corrupt, and so they'll naturally outmaneuver any honest people within the upper ranks and set things up nicely for themselves, which then means the next generation plays through it again but with the scales tilted even more towards corruption.   This is pretty broad scope of course, but I'd say it happens eventually to any man-made institution. But if you were worrying that I was attacking Catholicism/Christianity with an agenda, I'm not. I find the history interesting and like people thinking about it and reaching their own conclusions, but I don't like telling people what to think or how to act.",Ferelar,2025-05-04T08:21:56,1

The reality is that in a 2-party system you don’t have an option to punish the ruling party without benefiting the other side. Republicans that want to show they don’t want Trump are forced to vote for something they truly don’t want, and democrats who want to show their displeasure with Bidenomics had the same issue. A two-party system is a one party system that bounces back and forth regardless of party positions.

Let's not lop them together just because they're all Protestants.   If we're saying that all offshoots share the same doctrine, then Protestants share the same doctrine as the Catholic Church as Protestants are just an offshoot of Catholicism. Hell, Catholics are just offshoots of Judaism. Point is, the argument that one is an offshoot of the other so they must share the same principles is an incorrect argument to make. Argue using something else.   Digressions aside, one of the things that Luther spoke up against were indulgences, as indulgences were used to justify how someone rich can go to heaven. It's corruption at its finest, as you are saying that unfaithful people can buy tickets for their salvation. Luther's 95 thesis eventually led to the Catholic Church's reformation, and we should give credit where credit is due.

"This is clear you live 1000’s of miles away and are looking from a far distance. First I recommend reading W.E.B Dubois Souls of Black folk, who himself mourns the loss of southern culture because of the Southern Aristocracy’s refusal to move beyond Slavery.  The agrarian lifestyle, connection to the land taken over by the industrialist northern factory culture which didn’t value the worker any more than the southern aristocracy.  As each Southern state declared its secession - 100% of which were because of slavery - ironically Mississippi’s made an interesting point that the northern sweatshops treated their workers no better AND didn’t even provide housing.  So to pretend that the northern capitalists were supporting the Union out of altruism and were less racist, is just as naive.  But also to attribute culture only to that of the aristocracy is also foolhardy.  Plantation owners were a fraction of 1% and slave owners in general were a minority of a certain class.  In this feudalistic culture, the vast majority were dirt poor.  And the greatest threat to this power structure is interacial alliance, so the southern aristocracy did everything they could - through many of the same media tools today - to maintain segregation through spreading lies, deceit, and manipulation.  Why did they have to do this?  Because people are people and there was far more cultural integration between whites and blacks than is often represented.  The food, the music, etc etc - the life of the people, these are the tenets of culture it’s sad to see lost with continual aristocratic manipulation to maintain segregation.  After the Civil War many if not most poor whites were eager for the end of slavery because that meant the possibility of more gainful employment and upward mobility for all, including themselves.  A system based on owning humans doesn’t leave a lot of jobs for people when you can buy other people.  Thus the media campaign was swift and severe to publicly shame any whites befriending blacks.  Anyway, plenty more nuance to the 400yr history of the people of a region than just that of the 1%.  Having grown up in the mountains of southern WV and been a New Yorker for the last 15yrs, it’s hard to swallow the elitism and dismissing of an entire region and history of people.",adjacentadvance,2025-05-03T21:22:37,17

"The way I explain it is that you take scotch/irish people from up in the hills of Scotland and Ireland — not Dublin or Edinburg but way the hell up in the hills — and then mix that with African folks and some French folks and then bake ‘em real good for 300 years and you get old southern culture.  It’s not that genteel Ole Miss khaki tailgate bullshit, or some country and western rapper telling you about how much he loves America fuck yeah.  It’s rough in the way that you’d expect rolling up to an Irish village where you don’t know anyone would be rough — insular, down at heels, but also strong, self-sufficient, and loving for those who are a part of it.  And it’s very much not polished, and in no sense ideal.  But it’s a culture — a real, beautiful in its own way, sometimes wonderful and sometimes deeply fucked up culture.  And unfortunately it’s also a culture that has been deeply impacted by racism and propaganda.  The racism part was easy.  It isn’t hard to convince deeply insular communities that people who don’t look like them are bad.  That wasn’t an inevitable outcome of that insularity, but it’s hardly a surprising one.  The way they fell to propaganda is harder to explain — they should have been less gullible.  But, well, education isn’t the strong point of the culture, so…  But it would be a mistake to see the racism and stupidity and think that’s the culture.  It’s not.  It’s something that happened to the culture — but the culture itself is much more complicated.",SafetyDanceInMyPants,2025-05-03T22:02:57,6

"> Southern hospitality, IS A THING, I comfort you, welcome you into my home, give ya some sweet tea..it’s not fake.  That's nothing to do with being ""Southern"", that's to do with being human. If you're at the stage where you count the ordinary human virtues as something special, being Southern really is nothing cultural. Heck, the fact that you seem to claim that being kind and welcoming is a special thing tells us all a great deal about Southern-ness, if you don't all do it automatically.",TelescopiumHerscheli,2025-05-04T03:13:31,4

Despite outspoken racists commonly found in rural or overwhelmingly White counties, there is no better U.S. region to experience the melting pot of Black and White integrated society than in the South.

"> You do realize our culture has very strong ties to the black community, right? Its weird for a brit to sit here and pretend that they know what southern culture is.  I think it's safe to say that I have ""very strong ties to the black community"" myself. I don't ""pretend"" that I know what Southern culture is; I actually *do* know, just as I know what the other major world cultures are. In this country we have a functioning education system, as well as significant exposure to American media.  Further, you're wrong to claim blues or jazz as part of Southern culture. ""Southern culture"" (thinking of culture as a persistent pattern of beliefs, behaviours and mutually intelligible communicative artifacts) does *not* encompass either of these. Indeed, there is excellent evidence that Southern culture engaged in, and continues to engage in, the othering of both blues and jazz, as well as other initially black-created forms of music and art more generally. Comments that jazz is ""just noise"" or ""uncivilised"" or ""uneducated"", for example, as found in Southern culture show very clearly that Southern culture explicitly seeks to exclude black-created ""communicative artifacts"". Such black-created artifacts are treated as part of either some other ""denigrated alter-culture"" or as a ""disparaged sub-culture"". That is, they do not form part of the predominant ""Southern culture"".",TelescopiumHerscheli,2025-05-04T03:33:19,1

And you're free to dislike them for it or think they were cowards or whatever, but yes, the Clintons (and many other Democrats) were **NOTICEABLY LESS SHITTY THAN THE REPUBLICANS.** And again, you're free to hate that, or think it's not enough, and again, *I am not saying this to defend them, I am fucking saying it to explain why Americans who liked fucking Reaganism for its neoliberal economics would opt for Clintonism rather than the purer strain.*",The_Lost_Jedi,2025-05-04T00:17:59,11
"I'm sorry, but that's just not how anything works. Context is important. Hillary Clinton sucks, and I don't think she actually gives a single shit about gay people, but her position was absolutely center of the road for the time.   This is how politics works. Incrementally. First, they got civil unions for gay people, which was definitely better than nothing. It was a step in the right direction. Then after that, slowly more and more states voted to allow gay marriage, until the federal govt ruled on it and made it legal everywhere. Without the first part, we never would have gotten to the second part.",Papplenoose,2025-05-04T02:53:53,4
