"He had a green card. He is entitled to American rights. He's not even being accused of a crime. If you have a green card and are not being accused of a crime, but we detain you anyway, what the fuck are we doing? It's literally just a crackdown on free speech rights.

Free speech is absolute. That means everyone gets it. No restrictions.   Taking away someone’s green card when they haven’t even been charged with a crime is fucked up.,OkCommittee1405,2025-03-12T22:31:03,28
I hate Hamas and I think many leftists are insufficiently critical of Hamas. But that is not a crime. Deporting a permanent resident just because he disagrees with me or with the president is absolutely disgusting. The world is not going to be a better place when we go down this path of deciding some speech is criminal and it's shocking how many people are falling for the smokescreen of the green card.

"It’s actually not just a question of free speech.   There’s existing law that holds green card holders to a higher standard or else they may be deported. I’m not saying I agree with this or that it is morally right. But it is the current law.  https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title8-section1227&num=0&edition=prelim   For example:   (4)(A)(ii) any other criminal activity which endangers public safety or national security  (4)(A)(iii) any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means,  (4)(C)(i) An alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.  (4)(E) Participated in the commission of severe violations of religious freedom. Any alien described in section 1182(a)(2)(G) of this title is deportable.   Keep in mind that while some disqualifying actions require a conviction, many like the above do not actually require a conviction in a court of law.   And then in addition to all the above - there’s the whole area of “crimes of moral turpitude” that could get an immigrant kicked out even without a conviction, if the immigrant even just admits to doing such. Crimes like “lying” or “offensive touching” that would mean next to nothing to citizens.   Just saying as a former immigrant myself that was made very aware of all the things that could get one kicked out, prior to becoming a citizen.",SovietRobot,2025-03-13T12:51:01,17

"This guy is one of the leaders of CUAD (Columbia University Apartheid Divest), which has released numerous statements very explicitly supporting Hamas and terrorism both in Israel and the US, (as opposed to just disagreeing with Israel).  Let's see a few examples:  In an October 8 Instagram post in which the CUAD leadership apologized to member Kymani James for coming out against his January statements proclaiming “Zionists don’t deserve to live” and suggesting he was inclined to kill them because of their supposedly evil ideology, CUAD reiterated their support for the tool of political violence.  “We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,” said CUAD.   “In the face of violence from the oppressor equipped with the most lethal military force on the planet, where you’ve exhausted all peaceful means of resolution, violence is the only path forward.”  \----  In a November 7 Substack tribute, it described Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a “brave man” who will live in the hearts of many. CUAD praised the October 7 Massacre as “Sinwar’s crowning achievement” because the “Al-Aqsa Flood was the very essence of what it is to resist ‘with what we have.’”  “The act of Palestinian resistance on October 7, known as the Al-Aqsa Flood, breached Israeli security and made significant military advances. \[This is\] a day that will go down in history.”  \----  In a June 20 Instagram post, CUAD came out in support of Casey Goonan, who allegedly engaged in an arson spree of a University of California, Berkeley Police Department vehicle, a construction site, a brush area near a library, and another building. CUAD viewed it as a “rational action of targeting state infrastructure” in response to US support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza.  “CUAD stands in full support of Casey Goonan and all of our comrades who have bravely undertaken the call to escalate for Palestine,” said the coalition.  “The fires on UC campuses have been in direct response to the university’s violent police repression of their own students. The spark ignited on US campuses during the intifada of the last few months cannot be quelled, and further repression will only continue to transform these sparks into flames.”  \----  Ok, so all this is despicable but it is speech... Should it affect his immigration status?  According to the law, endorsing or espousing terrorism would make him inadmissible (not allowed to enter the US), and ineligible for most immigration benefits.  I would need a lawyer to know how this applies to foreign citizens who have already been given a green card. However, during the time these CUAD statements were released, he did not have a green card, but a student visa, and it was later that he applied and got the green card. If he didn't give information about his pro-terrorist activism when applying for a green card, that seems solid grounds to revoke it.  That's as far as legality goes. Coming into politics, if Democrats want to get in front of voters and argue that this person should remain as a guest in the US, they are going to have a seriously uphill battle to explain it.  Look, I'm anti-Trump myself for many reasons, but the US doesn't need to keep this guy as a guest in their country.",farseer4,2025-03-13T08:26:55,10

"Contrary to a lot of uninformed reports, he is not being detained for speech. He was a major organizer of Columbia protests, and organizations involved in those have been found to have links to listed terrorist organizations. (For example, Samidoun was linked to PFLP.) If he knew of those links and did not report them, that would be aiding and abetting a felony. Given the depth of his involvement in events they backed, this seems worth investigating. Additionally, he is under investigation after hate speech, advocacy of violence, and allegedly propaganda produced by a listed terrorist group were caught at events he organized.  None of this, however, is given as the legal grounds for deportation. There is a rarely used section of American law, Title 8 Section 1182-3-B clause 7 that permits deportation if the person ""endorses orespouses terrorist activity or pursuades others to endorse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization"". (This is later noted as including the PLO.) He clearly worked to pursuade others through rallies at Columbia. While many here might deem the actions of warmongering theocratic tyrants and their allies appropriate so long as they target Jews, these groips are legally listed terrorist organizations. Support of them, even only so far as working to pursuade others to excuse their attacks, therefore violates the Immigration Code section on Inadmissible Aliens. A 2008 ruling by the US Supreme Court found that green cards can be revoked as part of a deportation process for non-citizens, at which point he would need a visa for which he would not be eligible.",Beep-Boop-Bloop,2025-03-13T09:02:09,11

Complaining about stoping the war yet supporting those who are war mongers and are actively seeking more war rather than being gratefull for having a normal life in another nation ?  Im also againts the war in Gaza and in Ukraine but look at the difference.    No protests with crazy people on the streets that don't even know the actual cause of said war in Ukraine. Meanwhile there are thousands of videos that prove that majority of those protesting the war in Gaza and screaming from the river to the sea that they do not even know the meaning behind this slogan and also are just protesting to be a part of some group. Therefore people protesting in these kind of ""stupid"" protests have done nothing to help or change anything about it other than just being a nuisance on the street or the road blocking traffic. And also giving reason to those extreme people to come out and openly show a flag of ISIS or other terror groups without any repricussions. Yet now that finally someone is doing something about these no need protests you again scream for something without looking at the whole picture.  Tell me how christians would be treated in Gaza if they protested war in Ukraine ?   They would be locked up, beaten and even killed and we all know that. Only in christian nation we allow this to happen yet no one is doing anything about this. If you go into their countries you all damn well know how this is going down.

The current Minister of National Security of Israel belongs to a Kahane political party that advocates terrorism was founded by members of the Kach terrorist group.

Prime Minister Menachem Begin the leader of Irgun who founded Herut and Likud.  Who in 1982 committed genocide in Lebanon.    In 1987 you had Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir who was a former leader of Lehi, and a former member of Irgun, who had previously sought an alliance with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, who was responsible for numerous civilian massacres...  Illegally invaded Palestine with a military force of 80 thousand soldiers to stop a civilian protest in response to the illegal killing of Palestinian workers returning from a refugee camp.  Palestinians had closed their shops, refused to work in Israel, and closed their roads in Palestine.  1000 Palestinians were killed as a result.  This is what caused Hamas to be formed.  You fast forward to today and you look at what caused Hamas to gain control of Gaza and it has been the illegal occupation, the illegal seizure of territory and illegal assassination of Palestinian political leadership by Israel.  The illegal constraints on movement of the Palestinian people to move from the West Bank to Gaza and back by Israel.  Everything is projection when it comes to Republicans, the people who really support Hamas, are Israel and those that drive U.S. Israeli foriegn policy.  In the U.S. Republicans would be the biggest Hamas supporters of all.  They are what caused Hamas to form, to continue, and grow.

"You are not making any sense.  Again being pro-Palestinian isnt the same as being pro-Hamas.    And what exactly is Hamas rhetoric?  Because if you are talking about the River to the Sea, stuff that comes from the Land of Israel movement and Revisionist Zionism...  It was only later adopted by the PLO, then by Likud, then only later by Hamas.  And the current Israeli government is advancing the concept of Greater Israel.  So you have this massive double standard, and the laws should be changed to reflect that.  Anyone with a Green Card or Visa who supports Israel and/or Zionism should have their legal residency revoked correct?  There is also the issue that Palestine literally covers territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and people saying their country should be free from occupation isnt exactly some crazy shit.  So I am not sure how much traction you are going to get with that.  Who was distributing posters showing a boot stomping out the star of David?  Was it a boot stomping out just the star of David, or a boot stomping out the Israeli flag?  There is a difference.  And there has been documented evidence of counter-protesters and agent provocateurs pretending to be pro-Palestinian protesters at these events, so unless you have some evidence it doesnt mean much.  He helped organize a pro-Palestinian demonstration.  Not a pro-Hamas demonstration.  He has a Green Card and is protected by the U.S. Constitution.  He has the right to Free Speech.  He has not been arrested for any crime in relation to the protest, he has not been charged with any crime in relation to the protest.  ICE did not provide a warrant for his arrest.  They arrested him due to his residency status being changed and started his deportation process.  Federal laws were violated.   **Edit:  if you are going to respond, dont block afterwards.**  Under international law states do not have the right to exist, they only have the right to territorial integrity.  Palestines First Congress declared independence in 1919, Palestine was recognized as being independent and sovereign under the Treaty of Lausanne, the Balfour Declaration did not promise an independent state for the Jewish people, the League of Nations and the British both recognized Palestine as being an independent state, the Mandate for Palestine stated that no land or territory would be ceded or handed over.  The White Paper of 1939 reconfirmed the language of the Mandate and established there would be no independent state for the Jewish people without the express authorization of the Palestinians.  Throughout the 30s and 40s you have the Palestinians reaffirming their independence and sovereignty, In 1945 before the United Nations Charter is even ratified the League of Arab States recognizes the independence and sovereignty of Palestine as it becomes a member.  In 1948 The Mandate for Palestine ends and control is handed back over to Palestine.  Resolution 181 through the United Nations was a recommendation that relied on the Palestinian state entering into a Trusteeship under the United Nations as it was not a member.  Palestine rejected this.  Under international law right of conquest and the acquisition of territory through the use of force was long since illegal.  Zionist belligerents declaring independence in Palestine were violating international law, surrounding states came to Palestines defense and you have the Arab-Israeli War.  Israel does not have the right to exist under international law, it is violating the territorial integrity of Palestine.  Pragmatically speaking, is it realistic to expect that Israelis are ever going to hand over control to a Palestinian state?  No.  But the absolute bat shit insane historical revisionism that comes with people screaming about Palestinians trying to erase Israel is about the most intellectually dumb as shit thing thats involved in the entire conflict.  Israel is the aggressor, Zionist intentionally immigrated to the region to displace the native inhabitants.  The writings of Theodor Herzl are freely available online for anyone to read if they so choose.  Its not even a debate worth having.  Israel has been illegally occupying Palestine for decades, illegally kidnapping and holding hostage thousands of Palestinians a year for decades, murdering and raping Palestinians for decades, starving Palestinians for decades, committing ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians for decades...  You dont get turn around and cry whataboutism...  Prior to the Kingdom of Israel you have Canaan, and if you want to get technical the Peleset were settled in Canaan by the Egyptians prior to the Hebrews and Israelites, the Peleset also integrated with the Canaanites prior to the arrival of the Israelites and Hebrews.  If you want to compare ancient Israelites and Hebrews polytheistic animism and natural religion to modern Judaism go right ahead.  If you want to look at genetic markers, the Palestinian population traces back to the Canaanites, Peleset and Egyptians Just the same.  The image of the man you linked to?  Who the fuck knows who they are, are they a student, are they a provocateur.  The graphic, the posters origin, links to a site from Georgetown University.  And the protest and person in question is from Columbia University.  The image itself is from an entirely different Palestinian group?  Paliclub?  So not even the same group as the one protesting.  And on the image it specifically references Zionism, its not saying crush Jews, or crush Judaism.  So you lose points with that.  There is nothing really making this anti-semitic except a vague reference to the punk image of a boot smashing a swastica.  There is no reference to Hamas.  Im not saying you are entirely incorrect, its just a weak argument.  Where is the evidence that he received funding from the Iranian state?  Why does a pro-Palestinian protest need to condemn Hamas?  Does a Black civil rights demonstration need to condemn the Black Panthers, Black Guerrilla Family, Bloods, and Crips every time someone has a Black Lives Matter rally?  No.  One has nothing to do with the other.  Only a bigot thinks that they do.  Unless of course you think Jews need to condemn Lehi, Irgun, Palmach, Haganah, Kach, Herut, Likud,  Otzma Yehudit, etc...

"OP, towards your broader question about free speech itself:  The first thing I would ask if ""What is your definition of 'free speech'""?  If your definition, consciously or unconsciously, is: ""You can say a) whatever you want, b) whenever you want, c) without any consequence"" then I would argue you will find little legal, logical, or philosophical support for all three of those points.  You, as your God given right as an agent of free will, can say whatever you want, whenever you want. But you don't have the right to c.  For example, in the above definition, how would we ever enforce defamation, libel, or slander laws? You might argue, ""Because you would be bound to tell the truth."" (In fact, the original wording of the example of ""shouting fire in crowded theater"" includes the word 'falsely': [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting\_fire\_in\_a\_crowded\_theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater) )  But, if I can say ""whatever"" then shouldn't that mean I can lie?  So, it's arguable that we know there are cases where it's fair (or necessary) that speech not be completely 'free' (as in unrestricted) in that above definition for humans - and certainly not always without consequence. These are, of course, things that have been debated and decided in courts at various times.  [https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does-free-speech-mean](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does-free-speech-mean)  [https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/limits-free-speech](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/limits-free-speech)  The other side of things is that we can voluntarily restrict our 'rights' at various points in our lives whether citizen or non-citizen by the agreements we enter into (even if it's something silly like walking into a library where we agree to be 'quiet'). As others have pointed out, a green card holder comes with certain laws that govern them.  If I were a lawyer, and I were prosecuting this case, I would focus on the violation of the laws governing the agreements of a non-citizen green card holder (it's not a case about 'free speech' at that point but rather ""what you agreed to as a green card holder"") and see what rebuttals come my way. Someone else in the thread made this argument.  If I were the defense attorney facing the aforementioned case, I might try and prove that CUAD was not supportive of Hamas at the time that my client was a representative for them given that it says their rhetoric became more ""hard-line over time"".

It was only later adopted by the PLO, then by Likud, then only later by Hamas.

Cool so I guess that makes it perfectly okay, even if it was. Pro Hamas  >And the current Israeli government is advancing the concept of Greater Israel. So you have this massive double standard, and the laws should be changed to reflect that. Anyone with a Green Card or Visa who supports Israel and/or Zionism should have their legal residency revoked correct?  And their actions dont reflect that, considering we have the exact scenario of a ceasefire that Hamas decided to violate by sending the wrong body back. So whatbaoutism, cool.  >There is also the issue that Palestine literally covers territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and people saying their country should be free from occupation isnt exactly some crazy shit. So I am not sure how much traction you are going to get with that.  Actually thats the Levant that was Originally the Kingdom of Israel. Funny, that.

But you are saying anyone can stay in the US, even if they lie on immigration forms about their beliefs.  >It’s really funny considering that your first example quite literally happened.  You didn't read to the end.   The Bund also came under investigation. After its financial records were seized in a raid on the group's Yorkville, Manhattan headquarters on the Upper Eastside, authorities discovered that $14,000 (worth about $273,000 in 2021) which was raised by the Bund during the rally was unaccounted for – Kuhn had spent it on his mistress and various personal expenses. Kuhn was later convicted of embezzlement and sent to Sing Sing prison in upstate Ossining, New York in December 1939.[3] Kuhn's successor as the Bund's leader was Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, a spy for German military intelligence who fled south from the United States in November 1941. However, cooperative Mexican authorities forced Kunze to return to the United States, where he was sentenced to serve 15 years in prison for espionage.[13] The Bund's final national leader was George Froboese, who was in charge of the organization when Germany declared war on the United States, several days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, December 11, 1941. Froboese committed suicide a year later in 1942 after he received a federal grand jury subpoena.[3]  Nor read about the American Bund.  At the same time, Congressman Samuel Dickstein, chairman of the Committee on Naturalization and Immigration, became aware of the substantial number of foreigners who were legally and illegally entering the country and residing in it, and the growing antisemitism along with vast amounts of antisemitic literature which were being distributed in the country. This led him to independently investigate the activities of Nazi and fascist groups, leading to the formation of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, which was authorized to investigate Nazi propaganda activities and certain other propaganda activities. Throughout the rest of 1934, the Committee conducted hearings, bringing most of the major figures in the American fascist movement before it.[15] Dickstein's investigation concluded that the Friends represented a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in the United States.  Nor read about Fritz Julius Kuhn.  Kuhn's citizenship was revoked on June 1, 1943, while he was in Sing Sing prison, on the grounds of it having been obtained fraudulently as shown by his ongoing activity as a foreign agent of, and a person with loyalty including oaths of military service towards, Germany and the Nazi Party.[1][6] Upon his release after 43 months in prison, Kuhn was re-arrested on June 21, 1943, as an enemy agent and interned by the federal government at a camp in Crystal City, Texas. Interned with Kuhn were his wife and 16-year-old son, who were deemed ""enemy aliens"". Kuhn's family had returned to Germany in 1938, but came back to support him for the trial. They were repatriated to Germany in an exchange in February 1944.  The guy was an American Citizen and his citizen was revoked. Should the US not revoked it because of the 1st amendment?  > People can be turned away at the border, they cannot be given visas but once they are here their speech is guaranteed protection by the First Amendment.

If 45,000 people have died and 15,000 of them are Hamas fighters, then the civilian-to-militant casualty ratio is roughly **2:1**.  Given that the typical ratio is **9:1**, would you suggest that the IDF - killing 4x as few civilians as should be expected - is acting **more** or **less** discriminate in their execution of this war?
