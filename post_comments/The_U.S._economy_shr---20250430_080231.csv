THIS IS FAKE NEWS! MY NUMBERS ARE UP! The tariffs are GREAT and China is calling me everyday BEGGING for a DEAL. But I'm KING of making DEALS. We've got SO MANY DEALS in the works you won't BELIEVE it. More DEALS than anybody's EVER MADE anywhere.,TopEagle4012,2025-04-30T08:29:11,4

Also - the headline on Fox News right now???  *“Annoyed young democrat sends message to his party as Trump celebrates 100 days”*  Seriously? That’s what you care about?  While MSNBC talks about Tariffs and FEMA.,Rikers-Mailbox,2025-04-30T09:20:52,3
