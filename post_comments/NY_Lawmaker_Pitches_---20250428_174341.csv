"As per [original article](https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/us-news/nyc-lawmaker-pitches-ban-naming-public-buildings-after-felons-to-avoid-renaming-penn-station-after-trump/) 📰:  - State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) is considering introducing a bill to ban public buildings from being named after convicted felons — in a move to stop Penn Station from being renamed after President Trump.  The idea — first reported by Politico — arose after Gov. Kathy Hochul said she’d be fine renaming the Midtown transit hub to “Trump Station” if the president can get its long-stalled makeover done.  “I don’t think public officials who are convicted of a felony should have any state or municipal building named after them,” Hoylman-Sigal, whose district includes half the sprawling complex, told The Post Monday.  “We must hold our government officials to the highest standard and the names of our public facilities should reflect those values.”  Trump became the first felon commander in chief after a Big Apple jury last year found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records connected to hush-money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels.  The prospect of renaming Penn Station after Trump arose as the president and Hochul haggled over the multibillion dollar megaproject.  The talks eventually led to Trump’s shocking move nearly two weeks ago to fire the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from the project and put the feds in charge.  Hochul then moved to pull $1.3 billion in state funds from the project — as she contended the feds now carry the responsibility for completing the long-promised revamp.  She said Friday that she’s more worried about getting the project done than whether it’ll be called “Trump Station.”  “It would not be my favorite thing to call it, but it’ll save us $1.3 billion that I’m not planning to spend,” Hochul told reporters.",T_Shurt,2025-04-28T17:45:05,92
