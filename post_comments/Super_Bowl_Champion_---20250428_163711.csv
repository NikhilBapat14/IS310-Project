"‚ÄúNow watch this drive‚Ä¶‚Äù lol props to Barkley for doing what any normal American should do, if you get an opportunity to meet with a President, you do it. That‚Äôs such a huge honor.  It‚Äôs dumb when Republicans don‚Äôt visit a Democrat, I didn‚Äôt like Obama or Biden but given the chance to meet them, I would 100% do it.",BDSF94,2025-04-28T18:44:02,692

Gatekeeping who we can associate with based on politics will bring so much more harm than good. As shame the Dems cannot coexist with a majority of the country.,AndForeverNow,2025-04-28T17:49:58,128

"It's one of the things the Left does that I could never be associated with, this universal hatred where even if you have a photo taken with Trump (or Elon or whoever they don't like according to what the media tells them they shouldn't like) then it's instant guilt by association.  Like the vitriol against Carrie Underwood for singing at the Inauguration (and knocking it outta the park).  I mean, I thought Biden was a shitty person and shitty president but I'd have still shaken his hand and said hello out of respect for the office.",Merax75,2025-04-28T18:57:43,61
Reddit NFL is a mental ward. They totally ruined that sub lol,Highwiind-D4,2025-04-29T01:32:27,17
"Thats an awesome response imo. We need more people like him, who can just enjoy being around anyone without caring what their political opinions are.",belacscole,2025-04-28T19:03:23,42
"If someone called me up right now and said they'd fly me to Washington to have lunch with the president, I'm saying yes 100% of the time. I don't care if it's Joe Biden, Trump, or Kamala Harris. That's not an opportunity you pass down.",Bozzz1,2025-04-28T23:46:01,11

"Saquon is based, always liked the guy since his Penn St. days. He stays out of trouble, has a beautiful family, is persistent and hard working, doesn‚Äôt act like a diva and lets actions speak louder than words.   This is an athlete I can only respect and admire, and he should be the norm, not the exception.",gcr1897,2025-04-29T01:20:31,3
"Maybe not exactly the same thing, but I think my anecdote is related.  When I first joined the military in 2005 it was obvious that not everyone liked W. But for the most part people kept it professional and really didn't talk politics unless it was with people they knew wanted to have a civil discussion and it was over specific issues.  In 2012 I went to shore duty.  The shift was noticeable.  People could say W was a war ciminal, McCain was a terrorist, anything you wanted to about conservative politicians.  But if you said anything bad about Obama, even valid criticisms of his drone or Gitmo policies, you were accused of being unprofessional.    Bottom line, we need to get back to what Saquon is doing here.  Respect the office and pray for our leaders success.  Because when they succeed, America succeeds.",DrMaxwellSheppard,2025-04-29T07:47:40,1

I don‚Äôt agree 100% with any politician, but whenever I get to meet a politician I‚Äôm 100% going to meet them and tactfully have a conversation about things I disagree with that actually might be able to change.

"I have no interest to meet any of them. I voted for Trump but I couldn't care less about meeting him.  This includes famous athelets, actors, music people. Even if I like there stuff i dont need to them. Ive never had a autographed anything or picture. I dont need it. Unless I could sell the segnature.

This is exactly what was being said in the Eagles sub today. And I am a lifelong Eagles fan but these folks on Reddit are delusional TDS psychopaths. I got attacked for pointing out their idiocy. Not everyone is obsessed with politics and tribal.,gratefulguitar57,2025-04-28T22:01:27,16

Any localized subreddit (state or city) is embarrassingly over the top liberal. The people who are in charge of those subs are the same people who are being arrested for vandalizing Teslas!

"I live in MA, so I'm around very liberal people all of the time. It's so liberal, people just assume I'm liberal cause I'm a young woman and will openly bash Trump in front of me. And I couldn't give less of a shit.   We all get along and can joke around the water cooler. I don't know if it's a decline of social skills as a whole, but when did we lose the ability to be in mixed company?",ManufacturerFine2454,2025-04-29T13:10:34,7
