"It's a distraction, he could be king of MS13 with the names of every member tattooed on his dick, he still gets due process.",MurderBeans,2025-05-01T14:30:43,269
Tattoos are entirely irrelevant when it comes to due process. Don't buy into the Conservative ploy to avoid defending these blatant and egregious constitutional violations. The illegal deportations and deliberately subjugating people to cruel and unusual punishment should be at the center of the conversation.,LW_GLAZER,2025-05-01T14:51:34,27

"Disingenuous People  ""Pete Hesgeth's tattoos clearly just mean he loves jesus, regardless of their use as white supremecist symbols.  He should be in charge of our military""  Also Disingenuous people ""A skull and a marijuana leaf on your knuckles are such a clear indication of your membership to a gang we have declared a terrorist organization, that we should send you to a concentration camp without even a hearing"".  Nowhere to hide, your hypocrisy laid bare.  Don't even both engaging with these people other to mock them.",obligatorythr0waway,2025-05-01T15:20:33,10

It DOES NOT MATTER IF THEY ARE OR NOT. ITS AVOUT DUE PROCESS!,Unearned_Dopamine,2025-05-01T16:26:48,5
"Here's the thing, though... none of that even matters.  This guy could be the most evil murderer/childrapist/illegal-alien.  He would still deserve Due Process.  Once Due Process has been thrown aside, nothing else matters.  Nobody has rights anymore.",Sea_Minute_2457,2025-05-01T17:55:05,4

"White supremacists often wave or have the Jerusalem cross tattooed on them. Does that make Pete Hegseth a white supremacist? He probably is, but the tattoo Jerusalem cross isn't necessarily a white supremacists thing. That's why tattoos are subject to interpretation.

It doesn’t take an expert lol,dspliff,2025-05-01T18:14:01,1
Of course they aren't... the whole point of gang tattoos is that they are obviously gang tattoos. No one has gang tattoos that need to be decoded. But even if they were gang tattoos using the terrorism law to deprive someone of due process is unconstitutional pure and simple.,ManiaGamine,2025-05-01T18:19:44,1

"One hand could say F 45 and the other MS 13 and it doesn’t change the 2019 court rulings, the 2025 courts and Supreme Courts ruling.   The arresting department has said he is not MS13.   If he was MS 13 and all the evil that the MAGA Right Wing Media has said and The President and Government has said he was released in 2019 by DHS and who was the President in 2019?   So Trump released a violent criminal or it’s the clerical error that they stated. So odd the path they have chosen.",Morepastor,2025-05-01T21:35:44,1
Yeah but Trump said he’s an expert and said the tattoos literally say MS-13 and also that I should agree and not question him. So I’m all set /s,theonewhoknockwurst,2025-05-01T22:33:09,1
What if he actually had MS-13 tattooed on his forehead? Is that breaking any law? Is that worth an automatic life sentence with no due process?,gimmiesopor,2025-05-01T19:16:41,0

"I don't think the image was originally intended to be faked tattoos, rather an interpretation of the meaning of the pictures. This geriatric government doesn't understand how computers work, so thought they were actual tattoos.",pfalcon42,2025-05-01T19:33:55,8
Photoshop? That's downright generous. The image I saw looked like something an impatient ten year old would slap together in MS Paint.  Could we need any more proof that Trump is too old to be president?,SpoppyIII,2025-05-01T16:39:46,12

"So, I get what you are saying, but there is an inaccuracy here worth correcting.  A deportation hearing wouldn’t have a jury. The typical members would be the judge, the individual, the defense attorney, and an attorney for the Government.  This allows evidence to be reviewed appropriately and the Judge to make a final decision and meets the concept of *due* process for the situation.  The reason this distinction is inportant is because one of the arguments being made for why they can’t give due process is because “not every person can get a full trial”.   Ultimately the most important response is everyone gets due process, period. But I also believe that telling people, “What you heard is wrong. These are the facts or the law. They don’t care about your feelings” is an important step in how we present our argument.",MoonshotMonk,2025-05-02T02:30:30,2

"Even if he's a gang member, he's innocent of any crime.   If not convicted he's innocent.    He hasn't been charged with any crime.    Gang membership is a meaningless distraction, an innocent man had been stolen from his family and dumped in a foreign prison. ",NickelBackwash,2025-05-01T21:55:39,3
"Tbh I thought italicising the ""on his fingers"" instead of ""ON HIS FINGERS"" gave my tone. But I guess that could be taken as emphasis and nothing else.",Clarine87,2025-05-04T03:22:36,1
Not really an effective argument to organize around.  This was a working father who was kidnapped off the street and disappeared to a concentration camp designed for no one to leave.,Seesaw_LAD,2025-05-01T19:03:30,0
"Respect for our constitutionally guaranteed rights is absolutely an effective argument to organize around. And while it helps to have a symbolic person as the face of it that is very sympathetic, it can be dangerous. Because then all someone has to do to destroy your argument is impugn that person.   I wouldn't put it past this government to invent evidence that Abrego Garcia is a violent criminal. They're already trying. And then the argument is about whether or not he deserves to be in prison, and not about how his rights were violated.",acemerrill,2025-05-01T19:41:26,6
"You are never going to convince some people that he is not a gang member.  They would believe it even if there were no questions about his past.  And while the normal answer would be ""well who cares about those people"" those people do vote.  Having them understand that a fundamental core beliefs of America is due process for all and that if he is so obviously a gang member than it shouldn't be hard to prove, is imo, a much easier hill to climb.",BanditsMyIdol,2025-05-01T20:41:06,1
