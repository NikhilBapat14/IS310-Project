"At this point most Conservative justices aren’t upholding the constitution. They are ruling based off a) backdoor money and lavish trips, and b) Christian fascism.   They are by far the most politically motivated court in the history of the Supreme Court. May Justice come for them when the time comes to hold people accountable for the fascism that is tightening its grips on America, and the atrocities being committed under their watch.",HighDrive2RightField,2025-05-06T14:28:37,2

"""Justices rule ban can be enforced while challenge plays out in court, a decision that could lead to thousands discharged"". This is a clever tactic that SCOTUS is starting to use: delay a final decision until irreparable damage has been done. Then declare the issue moot, thus avoiding a definitive decision. We'll see much more of this as Trump II continues.",nogooduse,2025-05-06T19:43:05,0

"So people are losing their careers, their Healthcare and their paychecks during an economic collapse. All WHILE it is going through appeal. Shouldnt we keep the injunction protecting people until it goes through appeal?   Non sensical bs. Veterans are going to die because of this.

"It doesn't matter if they ruled on the merit or not. They lifted the injunction to that the Trump admin can start purging trans people from the military. This will cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs who will lose career status, earnings, etc. even if the courts ultimately find in their favor at some point in the future, which may take years.  That's why injunctions are used in the first place. They're intended to hold the status quo and reduce the amount of harm/damages that can be done.",Areyounobody__Too,2025-05-06T13:56:45,15

"The economy is shrinking, tens of thousands have been fired from their jobs. Companies are cutting back on hiring and instead firing people because of the tariffs and the struggling economy. Shelves will be empty soon and what is left will be hiked up to unreasonable prices.
