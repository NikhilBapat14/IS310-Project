This guy looks exactly like what you would expect someone who takes joy in deporting children to look like.  What an epic POS.,Dolphintrout,2025-04-27T14:46:56,149
"They keep talking about deporting violent criminals who are threatening the safety of Americans. Yet they also deport people like this who pose no threat. Why is it so important that this mom was deported? Their lives have been upended, their families split apart, their ties to their communities broken... for **nothing.** This doesn't make anyone safer. All it does is cause trauma.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T14:55:52,56

"From the article:  “Having a U.S. citizen child doesn’t make you immune from our laws of the country,” Homan said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “American families get separated every day by law enforcement.”  Just days ago, a federal judge sounded the alarm after lawyers accused the Trump administration of deporting a 2-year-old U.S. citizen without “meaningful process.”  The child was deported alongside her sister and mother, who was found to be in the country illegally. Her father filed a petition for release.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 16 in Louisiana.  Homan defended the decision for deportation, saying it’s on the parents if they put their children in that situation.  “Having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally is not a get out of jail free card,” he said.",kootles10,2025-04-27T14:43:00,19
