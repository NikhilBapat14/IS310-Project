"It's not exactly polarization (absolutely a huge problem) as much as it is that one side's ideas and goals are not based in or aligned with reality. The economy is now global and the right has a fundamental misunderstanding of what our trade ""deficit"" and national debt actually mean in that context, which sets them up to fight/vote against policies that would strengthen our position in the world financially and diplomatically.  We are seeing this accelerate America's one-country race to the bottom in real time. Russia has a big head start in that direction, but apparently American oligarchs saw that situation and decided that's the future they want for America.   Sure, the left has its issues with radicalization, but if it were to be allowed to drive foreign and domestic policy in the same way as the right is doing at light speed through trump right now, the worst that would happen is that some jobs would be lost and the economy might contract a bit in the name of protecting the environment and providing health care to people. The benefits would massively outweigh the costs over the long term.",frisbeejesus,2025-05-04T18:09:24,102

"I'd say our prospects are collapsing.  This foolish America-versus-the-world trade war has put us in a weak position and laid bare our flaws as a functional democracy.  The US dollar has been the world's reserve currency because the world could trust that the US economy and institutions would remain stable and strong.  No longer.  We the people have proven ourselves to be unreliable (twice electing an unstable amateur with delusions of grandeur), and Trump has sealed the deal by eroding the institutions and throwing the economy into chaos.",the_malabar_front,2025-05-04T18:13:43,25
Most likely stagnation. The birth rate is low. The debt is high. It's unclear as to whether or not technology gains will drive inequality higher.   It's possible that a moonshot technology like self-driving cars or asteroid mining will expand the economy but I'm not holding my breath.,bunsNT,2025-05-04T19:34:21,9

"I think it’s a big problem and will continue to hamper effective governance, but not sure it’s a root level problem or just the byproduct of other issues (like the dying print media industry, dark money and weak campaign finance laws, gerrymandering and partisan primaries, fpp voting and the electoral college).  The fact that congress is stuck in permanent partisan gridlock and thus most consequential lawmaking is happening via EO in recent years definitely reflects and possibly exacerbates the divisions. I think structural reforms are overdue at the federal level. Trump is at least cosplaying to do that (in wrong direction imho), but again via EO so doesn’t offer the resilience/stability that actual congressional laws or constitutional amendments offer.",peetnice,2025-05-04T18:08:04,10

"Biden’s economy was booming by all objective measures and the infrastructure bill and IRA were creating a massive factory construction boom that was projected to grow the economy and add hundreds of thousands of good paying middle class jobs. Even the oil & gas industry was making  record profits. It was called the envy of the world. Trump is trashing those gains out of spite and ideology. His unprovoked trade war is also destroying US influence in the world and driving up consumer prices. I think there is only one clear roadblock to the US economy continuing to grow and prosper, and it's not political division.",mafco,2025-05-04T18:27:10,15
"To answer your question, ask an observer from outside the States. Unquestionably, they generally know more about US Geopolitics and Economics than Americans due to the differences in the consumption and sourcing of News.   I'm European, so have a very different perspective. We regularly meet Americans who have moved here to live and work and, when asked,  all the members of this diaspora (without exception) have no intention of ever returning to the States. From our perspective, the US is in rapid decline, and it seems that many many Americans are completely oblivious to the reasons why. This is due to the lack of attention given to current affairs and, more importantly, international news. As painful as it can sometimes be, it is often a very good idea to read or watch international news bulletins covering your country as they most often present a very impartial analysis.  So, as a European living within a collection of 27 individual countries with different cultures and languages, why has our society thrived and what are the things we would suggest should be done in the US in order to reverse the trend? Well, let's look at five very stark differences first.  1. Health. Generally, the health services in the EU are free to all citizens. It is free to call an ambulance. Prescriptions cost nothing, or very, very little. Children's healthcare is completely free. You can get private health insurance if you want, but the public systems can be just as good. The thinking here is that if your population is less stressed about health and it's cost, them productivity and morale increase. In the US, people's access to healthcare is tied to their employment, through benefits. In other words, your employer has you by the balls. This is why the majority of rational Americans are petrified of protesting as they are afraid of losing their job and, by extension, their health benefits.  2. Education: Again, more or less free for ALL citizens, and there are also grants and financial supports for those lower down on the economic scale. Over 95% of European citizens have college or university education, with English being the Lingua Franca. Take Ireland as an example. In the 80's, it was in the midst of the Troubles and an economic basket case. The government offered free education to all and, within a few decades, the country was transformed into one of the richest in the World. ( although, living here, we have made a few mistakes when it comes to not enough housing, but that will be addressed very soon. It's not like we don't have the money to do it).   3. Social Supports and Taxes. Unlike the US, We can see where our taxes go, which is why we more or less accept the annoyance of paying them. They pay for health, education, infrastructure, social supports, welfare, and all the important things which a society needs to be successful. I'm return, employee rights are very favourable. We are entitled to 21 days holidays each year ( more in some countries), we get sick pay, parental leave and public holidays. We work to live, not live to work. This actually increases productivity. A happy workforce, and all that. We simply cannot understand how, in the US, the idea of using taxes to look after your citizens in your society, particularly the vulnerable, can be deemed as communism in America. It's a deeply flawed viewpoint. Our system in the EU has worked successfully for a long time.   4. Secularism and the separation of Church and State. Example: In Europe, If a candidate running for election even mentioned God, Jesus, Muhammad, the Virgin Mary or religion in any way, they would be immediately dismissed, ridiculed or ignored by the populace. Bringing religion into politics is a big ""no-no"" and there is a definite line between church and state. Not so in the US. Religious fanaticism and Christian evangelicalism is threaded through almost every facet of US politics and has created an extremely dangerous situation, feeding into the ideology of Right-Wing American. It's interesting to note that, apart from possibly Bernie Saunders, there is not one single politician in the US at the moment who would be taken seriously if they ran for election in Europe. Our press would eat them alive, for starters! Europe is a very secular entity, and it works.   5. Freedom and safety. Despite what many in America would have you believe, compared to Europe, the US is certainly not ""free"" and hasn't been for a long time. You must remember something. In Europe, we live in a Rules-based society, BY CHOICE!. Our politicians and laws work because they are mandated by we, the citizens. We need rules to manage a society populated by half a Billion people, otherwise you get chaos. That's not suppression of freedom, its just common sense! Our press have far more latitude to hold politicians to account. We have freedom of speech, but we also temper it with hate-speech legislation. But that's OK! In fact, it's necessary!. We are free to walk our roads without being picked up by police for....well, WALKING! ( This happened to me in Staunton, Virginia, when I went on a stroll out of town one sunny summer's evening. Walking, it seems, is frowned upon!). We have state or public broadcasting organisations who's job is to have the freedom to question the activities and choices of our politicians on our behalf. This key component is missing in the States.  On Safety, we simply banned 99.999% of guns. We did, the people. It wasn't forced on us. We did it to protect our society and our children.  In Ireland, our police are unarmed. Yep. No guns. Considering our history, that's quite remarkable. Now most of you already know some of our history, an everyone on the planet knows how completely flawed the US is in its approach to gun ownership, so there's no need to repeat it, yet again. I'll just leave it by saying this. We have had zero school-shootings, and zero mass shootings in our country since the foundation of the state. In fact, I'm 53 and have never even seen a real gun in Ireland. I'm not a farmer!  There's five points to start with. In my view, if the US could tackle these five issues, together with changing your voting system to something similar to ours, which is Proportional Representation, the positive effects on your society and Economy would be profound.",Lopsided_Drawer_7384,2025-05-05T03:53:52,8

"Collapsing at the moment. Mass tariffs are a great way to destroy a nation's economy. That's why nobody does them. Nationalist economic policies are horrible for a nation and especially in 2025 because the world is just globalized - there is no changing that. If you don't participate in the global economy as freely as possible you just lose big time to whoever else does. It's like if an NFL team decided to not use the forward pass and only go with a run game. Because globalization is efficient. There are tons of things the US can't do and tons of resources we don't have in the quantities needed to be self sufficient. And some jobs are best done by poor people in poor countries - jobs that would simply not exist in the US because the high wages would make them not profitable. If we moved textile manufacturing back to the US like trump wants to, then the price of clothing would skyrocket. It's also a terrible job that no one wants to do. We're lucky here because we're industrialized and rich, so we should be focusing on high paying jobs and working to improve our educational system to ensure we keep those jobs here. Not bring back unskilled menial labor jobs.   We're also slowly declining for a number of reasons. We've taken our foot off the gas with education. We focus on a service economy that doesn't create durable goods. Our corporations are focused on quarterly reports that they put short term profits above long term stability. And we're allowing all wealth to be accumulated in just a few hands, which leads to mass poverty and a sicker work force.   It's telling that immigrants are the people who do the best here, because they bring a much stronger work ethic. Most American companies have switched to models that constantly require selling less product for more money. Nothing is made to last. Subscription based products are just focused on ripping people off without delivering anything extra.   Socialism is a failed experiment IMO, but the kind of capitalism we have developed here is failing spectacularly at delivering a better life for people. So much so that millions of people are trying to go back to simpler ways of living like mini farms. Our capitalism doesn't reward the strongest competitors - instead it rewards those who capture political positions and fleece the taxpayers, and pump up stocks with stupid tricks. Musk is a prime example. He's gotten tens of billions of dollars in free government help to build businesses where he and other shareholders keep all the profits, and he pumps up the stock price with gimmicks instead of delivering a good profit.   We're in bad shape long term but trump's tariffs are throwing gas on the fire. China is winning the trade war and will be the new economic superpower soon.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-05T16:27:25,2
"Collapsing. People are delusional if they think manufacturing is going to come back to America with a tariff in place. People can’t even afford building materials now. Come the fuck on.  I’m a tiny business, I order 380 items of inventory every two weeks for $815. I make $4900 off that. I’ve been able to buy a house, I had $28,000 in savings when he was elected, and I had my electric shut off last week for two days. Single mother with two kids, I had no running water for two whole days. That $815? Yeah, it’s now $1907.10. I mean, how the fuck is that sustainable?  But it’s more than that, he went after federal grants and fed funding. So the daycare subsidy that I had is gone, they have no money, my daycare for my two children, one toddler full-time, one six-year-old after school, *was* $200 a week. $800 a month, which is *still* a lot tbh. **Now its $590 a fucking week.**  Let’s talk about energy costs, that shit’s not going down.

"The damage that Trump and his Republican enablers have done already to the American economy will take decades if not a century to reverse.  And that’s not just in terms of growth, but international trust.    Our former trade partners are going to find alternate suppliers amidst this tariff uncertainty and they’re simply not going to switch back.  Nobody will make significant or lasting deals with America because the electorate can’t be counted on to vote against inconsistent or hostile leadership in the next term.  We also rely a lot on tourism, and that’s already seen a sharp decline as international travelers avoid the US for safety and ideological reasons.  Where I live, I fear the Canadians snowbirds that help power our economy are simply not going to come back at the end of this year.  They’re fucking pissed, and they have a right to be when the POTUS keeps saying he wants to annex them.    We’ve already had one quarter of negative growth, so we are well on our way to an official recession.  Store shelves are going to be bare in just a couple weeks, and people will start hoarding supplies.  More lay-offs will occur.  Our federal government’s been gutted, so nobody’s getting assistance there.  Insiders think that Social Security checks are likely to be interrupted, and that’s not even counting if they get outright slashed in the budget bill alongside Medicare.

I think we need tax incentives to encourage entrepreneurship and common sense regulations that let businesses thrive. That in conjunction with social safety nets is the path I think we should follow.

"To be completely honest, the way I see it playing out is one of many different scenarios. Republicans either hold control in 2026 and 2028 or they lose twice and allow a little bit of sanity back into our internal and external economics. The Republican Plan is completely outrageous and it has been essentially since Reagan tried it. Cut taxes and hope that props up the economy enough for it to hold. Key issue though is that it almost never works. Cutting taxes doesn’t necessarily end recessions nor does it accomplish the things people say it does. It doesn’t spark extended periods of job growth nor does it stimulate the economy, keep in mind it costs a hell of a lot of money too. It’s been 30 years since Reagan was in office and the wage gaps have only increased, and nothing has really changed. If this plan is launched and they keep it in place, our economy will lower and I see it as bottoming out compared to what we know, before becoming the new standard and everybody taking credit for that",XxCaptainJayxX1,2025-05-07T11:34:44,1

"The prospects are dim, expect a major depression/recession.  We essentially need the politicians to come together recognize and be serious about solutions.  We have been running debt forever, but over the last ten years and accelerating over COVID, where it was fine before, it is taking a life of its own and it is not controllable without severe pain.  We wont recognize it until it is too late.  The problem is the basic understanding of economics, money and MMT.  We can all agree that if we were incredibly productive, we would have tons of products/goods/services, real wealth, enough for everyone, they would be cheap and we would be prosperous.  The economic system is built to encourage people to produce.  The problem get to be in how we divide wealth and if the right proportion of products are being made, traditionally guns vs. butter.  That is where money comes in, it is simply how we divide/claim things of actual value.    The problem is that the Federal government spends much more money than it collects.  It claims goods, and produces, well mostly paperwork, albeit with some roads, and guns, etc.  It is too big, about 35% of the GDP, so not enough butter.  The problem is that we are in debt more than the GDP, we owe 29/36 T (the first part is owed to the public, with the second includes that part the government holds itself).  The point is that 1.1T dollars of the  deficit was interest payments on this debt.  It is compounding, it is accelerating towards a crisis.  Some modern economists want to dismiss the problem. But we can either fund more debt (hastening our default), simply have the government just keep paying the bills from uncollected funds (print money), or they say (MMT Kelton)  can grow with the debt, say GDP growth of >3%(not  dependable possible for about 20 years now).  But that is not going to happen, we have an aging population, low birth rate, and immigrants tend to be poor requiring years to develop to produce the tax revenue we need.   We desperately\\need more rich people and businesses to tax.  If we print more money to pay our deficits rather than issuing bonds, we are stealing value from the dollar, which hurt all dollar holders, which will cause selling of dollars worldwide.  The inflation that is caused does not necessarily lead to the right kind of economic growth.  For instance, if you flood the economy with dollars via the Fed Reserve to mostly goes to the wealthy.  What are they going to buy?  Real estate.  What are we going to build more luxury homes, not more food, or start homes or apts, so what happened during Covid?  The basic reality is that we need to add to the supply side, we need to produce the necessary and correct goods for the non-rich public that are taken by the government (or otherwise not produced in lieu of government funding), no monetary theory can change that.  UPenn and Wharton have been studying this, but we are so far gone that the cuts they propose will almost certainly, will not happen for the next few years (if ever for the Democrats).  I think Trump thinks he can grows us out of it by promoting business in the US, but he will be stymied by people who down understand.  Lastly, all we need is one more war to fund or recession, and it becomes impossible to work our way out.",kenmele,2025-05-10T16:00:33,1
"There is also another elephant in the room that Americans seem to be ignoring. That is, it's unrelenting support for Israel and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.  The US is currently on the wrong side of history here and have underestimated the extent to which Europeans, in particular, see this as a red-line situation.  It seems that Americans do not understand the differences between antisemitism, and criticism of Israeli foreign policy.  This flawed view was highlighted in the recent hearings for the appointment of ambassadors to European countries. Republican senators seemed to be unable to understand both Irelands and the Netherland's approach to Israeli actions in Gaza, together with the International Criminal Court. This may seem irrelevant to Americans but what you don't realise is that European policies are driven by the mandate of the citizens. Almost all European citizens oppose US and Israeli policies in the middle east, which only hastens and strengthens our resolve to completely disassociate ourselves from America in every possible way.  It's not a good look when European citizens phones are checked for criticism of Israeli foregin policies.

It’s a root level problem that the U.S. is now politically unstable and has politics that resemble that of a developing country.   Economic growth comes from stability and long-term investments/coordination of national resources. Big policy shifts every 4 years just mean whiplash and stagnation. Really resembles Argentina in many ways.,das_war_ein_Befehl,2025-05-04T20:42:26,4

"1) The majority of US states (41 out of 50 states now) are now under Medicaid expansion laws that covers unemployment so your hilariously incorrect take on most Americans being too scared to protest because of losing health insurance doesn't face with reality in that the majority of Americans have access to healthcare even during unemployment.   2) PISA scores put America below Canada, Australia, and Ireland but higher than France, Spain, Norway, and Germany: [https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/pisa-scores-by-country](https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/pisa-scores-by-country)  3) In addition to Medicaid expansion for the utterly vast majority of Americans by now, there's also WIC for baby care and pregnancy, SNAP/EBT for general food purchases, LIHEAP for electricity and home heating and cooling, Section 8 for subsidised rent, SSI/SSDI for disability (although this needs reform), Lifeline for government-paid mobile phones, and TANF for temporary welfare assistance.

"You mean the rank and file that have been voting for these party leaders and Republican representation that is expressly anti-American for decades.  Conservatives do not love the Constitution, the Constitution applies to everyone in the U.S.    Conservatives push an ideology that the Constitution should only apply to specific people they approve of and everyone else are excluded.  What made Trump popular with Conservatives wasnt a promise for jobs or economic prosperity it was opposition to social progress and anger about a black man being President.  Right before the election you had the Ferguson protests, systemic issues within law enforcement boiling over and Conservatives resisting any effort to address it.  Resisting efforts to ensure the U.S. Constitution was enforced across the board and everyones rights were protected.  Trump promised to set back the clock.  Look at the policies Trump supporters latched onto.  The whole anti-woke culture war.    Illegal immigration isnt actually a significant problem for the country, people focus on it because they are racist.  unempathetic and selfish, rather see people suffer than help them even when there is a shared benefit.  Exponentially more money is being spent to control immigration than illegal immigrants cost U.S. tax payers.  A fiscal conservative would look at 'Conservative' immigration policy and scream in terror.  The fact of the matter is that a tax and spend Democrat is not only a fiscal conservative in the sense that they are against deficit spending, but that they are for 'limited government,' when compared to 'Conservatives.'  Conservatives support increases in government spending for the top of the food chain while cutting resources to the bottom to the detriment of the country, while Democrats generally support increases in government spending across the board.  The absurd Republican Trickle Down theory, in combination with corporate influence since the 70s has basically been responsible for 120 trillion dollars being stolen from the bottom 90% to give to the 1%.  Its Republican policy driving increases in the size of government, increases in spending, increases in inflation and consumer prices.  Conservatives have long since dropped any pretext of supporting a Constitutional Republic in favor of Italian styled fascism.  Republicans are fiscal radicals and economic terrorists.   The reality is if the U.S. wanted to reduce illegal immigration it would change its foriegn and domestic policies to stop destabilizing South and Central America.  Trump passed sanctions on Latin America and used his private security to try and overthrow Venezuela, which increased the immigration into the U.S. and was responsible for the large influx of Venezuelans.  Again it was Republican border states that started busing mostly Venezuelan immigrants into L.A., Chicago, NYC, Denver, etc... With zero communication with local authorities as a political ploy to cause economic damage to Democratic controlled cities.  If Conservatives gave a single shit about any of the issues they pretend to care about none of this would have happened.  Its the same reason the far right has gained popularity in Europe.  Europe exploits Romania for its manufacturing and cheap labor, exploits its former colonies in Africa that only gained independence in the 60s and 70s.  And when immigrants arrive on boats they lose their shit?  Europe joins the U.S. in interfering in Middle Eastern affairs, contributing to generations of war destabilizing the entire region and then turn around and complain when people flee to someplace safer?  Sorry, but the rank and file hated Obama because he was black, voted for Trump because they were racist.  The modern Republican party is a racist fascist Christian nationalist party.  They are modern day Nazis.  Republican voters cant disassociate from that.",neverendingchalupas,2025-05-05T08:01:09,8

"Repeating the same thing doesn't make you right or make a dumb take suddenly make sense.    This has nothing to do with capitalism. There are plenty of examples of capitalist companies (northrop grumman, spaceX, general atomics, anduril, TSMC) that dont do this and are still doing well. Defense contractors do this by necessity thanks to the nature of government contracts.     Hate elon as much as you want but spaceX has been one of the most transformative companies in the defense world even moreso than any of the primes or competitors overseas. Numerous non-prime aerospace companies （general atomics, anduril, kratos, shieldAI) have shown extremely good promise over the old primes for the same reason - they didnt sit on their laurels and government funds and take the safe and easy way. They spent billions of their own money to invest in tech and manufacturing processes that allowed them to out compete the original primes in the collaborative combat drone competitions. Any number of Chinese companies are the examples of this. They didnt stop at copying. They invested, learned and innovated and now have either achieved parity or taken over the market. Contrary to popular belief, its also why Boeing secured the 6th gen fighter contract over lockheed - they really did put in the work to offer a more innovative product since losing the JSF competition to Lockheed. At least according to the air force boeing's offer was impressive while  lockheeds offering was more conservative and based on thier current products and thats despite both companies facing heavy scrutiny and hemmoraging money in poorly managed programs. Its also why the koreans and japanese will be building our ships in the future - because they and their policy makers retained their capabilities, invested in manufacturing infrastructure and have significsnt chunks of the shipbuilding market in their hands while we chose to close down docks, stop investing in that infrastructure and refuse to institute policy reforms. Ill even add to this list the 1800s and 1900s that laid the foundation for american hegemony - innovators inventing things and bringing tangible improvement to society while constantly investing in building the next breakthrough thing.       None of these companies are ""socialist"" whatever the fuck a socialist company even means. If you mean heavily subsidized companies, US shipbuilders, chip companies and refineries are prime examples of heavily subsidized companies that have done nothing but dilly dally, live off government subsidies and handouts and refuse to innovate at least until recently. For every american company that produces real and innovative products, theres at least ten who  basically aspire to be another shitty middleman service to further inflate cost while producing nothing but gutter trash. Whether you are running a country or a company, there is a way to earn money and secure longevity. Then there is a way to earn money at the expense of your longevity. Neither has anything to do with capitalism or not. Invest into future capability and innovate and you'll always have money for your investors. You'll always have a viable business that isnt reliant on whether your supplychain daddy wants to sell you his rare earth goodies or not.  Cut larger paychecks to pay investors while cutting corners and one day you'll have lost the expertise, the knowhow and the capability and be out competed by your competitors while at the mercy of your supply chain daddy and his tyrannical whims.",i_rae_shun,2025-05-05T10:41:07,3
