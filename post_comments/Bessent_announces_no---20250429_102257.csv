It will be about the same as the trade deal already in place. Maybe a bit worse. But they will claim it's brilliant.,Needleworker3000,2025-04-29T10:25:32,12
"From the article:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced no new tariff deals with major trading partners Tuesday but hinted negotiations with India may be close to concluding with one.  ‚ÄúSeventeen are in motion,‚Äù Bessent told reporters at the White House, referring to negotiations with trading partners.  When asked if there could be an announcement on India this week, Bessent expressed optimism but wouldn‚Äôt commit to a timeline.  ‚ÄúI think that we are very close on India, and India ‚Äî just a little inside baseball ‚Äî India, in a funny way, is easier to negotiate with than many countries because they have very high tariffs and lots of tariffs,‚Äù Bessent said.  He said talks with Asian trading partners are the closest to leading to a deal because those allies ‚Äúhave been the most forthcoming‚Äù with negotiations.  So much for '200 trade deals' üòÜ",kootles10,2025-04-29T10:23:30,6

I call the dhole thing BS. If we're lucky it'll be the same as it was before. It doesn't do anything about the Chinese trade war. As for a deal with India...that would be Cina via circumvention.¬†,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-29T10:33:57,3

"Bessent is one of the more interesting characters in all of this.  If you look at who he is and his past and all that, it seems like he must be having some sort of prolonged out of body experience.  He has a solid grasp on trade and definitely has always had his sights lasered in on China but his take on how to negotiate with them (and probably anyone else) differs significantly from his boss.  It's funny in interviews to watch him shift from being able to speak as himself to having to get on script.  In this case the no new trade deals must be really easy for him to say given its absolute truth.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-29T11:04:55,2

"I mean, the administration only has to announce a concept of a plan for a deal to distract the media and public at large from concentration camps, suspending habeus corpus, etc.",C_MMENTARIAT,2025-04-29T10:42:58,5
He's the Rex Tillerson of Trump 2. His book is going to be fascinating.,TSAOutreachTeam,2025-04-29T12:51:26,1
