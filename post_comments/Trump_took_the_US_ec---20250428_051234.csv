"Not quite right.    He’s taken the world economy to the brink of crisis in just 100 days.   For the US economy, It’s way over the brink.  Past the point of no return.  It just takes a little while for the effects to kick in.",BannedForEternity42,2025-04-28T05:19:55,40

He’d have done it sooner but he kept delaying and undoing many of his tariffs.  If he stuck to his “plan” and did it all on day one it would’ve been a month.,llahlahkje,2025-04-28T09:53:56,1

"For a decade straight. It was all publicly available. He has been a public figure since he was a child. The other side doesn't care to know the truth and does not want to listen. It is easily provable he is a selfish, lying, failure of a businessman, and they just refuse to grasp that, and instead believe the opposite despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I am honestly sort of beyond trying now, if you don't already know he's a bad person, it's basically a negative personality trait to me now.   Touch the fucking stove, indeed.
