And now they’re motivating people to keep their money outside of banks. Genius.,NyJosh,2025-05-10T13:53:29,60
Is it really your money if you can’t withdraw it at your pleasure?,SouthernNumismatist,2025-05-10T13:58:14,137
This is insane for a western country. These policies are straight out of a 3rd world cookbook,Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-05-10T12:51:21,104

So you have to tell them the reason you are withdrawing the money on top of the rest of the bullshit?  lol.,bw2082,2025-05-10T14:00:07,37

Making it more of a hassle to hold cash so a digital currency is more easily swallowed.,Panzershrekt,2025-05-10T15:05:03,7
>The Spanish government emphasises that these measures are part of a broader effort to ensure the traceability of significant cash movements and to clamp down on the illicit use of physical money.  bitcoin is a literal checkmate against this shit. This 100% is implemented to prevent surprise bank runs during financial crashes. You literally don't own your money for 24 hours under this law.,durden111111,2025-05-10T16:29:47,6
"I don't expect any European country to treat it citizens well.  As for America, we need MORE cash.  Given inflation, a $200 bill is appropriate (matches the Euro) and gives Trump an opportunity to put Reagan on a bill and piss off the left.  Also, many venues took Covid as a roaring opportunity to go cashless, despite currency NOT being a vector for a respiratory virus.  Would like to see Republicans pass some laws requiring currency be accepted.  And on top of all that, many places charge you for using a credit card these days.  I've written more checks and paid for more things in cash the last year than the previous 5.  Cash is FREEDOM from scrutiny, and sure, it's used by bad actors too, but the cost is worth it in the same way that 2A is worth it.",TedriccoJones,2025-05-10T17:04:43,4
"This is a ridiculous overreach by the Spanish government. Do they want everyone to hide their money in their mattresses rather than put it into banks? Sounds like they do. After all, that is what happens when they make it impossible for you to withdraw your own money. What is even the point of putting money in the bank if you can't withdraw it easily?",Pugnatum_Forte,2025-05-10T16:48:54,1
How was that saying? People will own nothing and be happy?,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-10T14:14:03,50
"IIRC, most governments consider themselves the sole owner of their currency when it gets down to the nitty gritty. Yet another reason I hope something like crypto takes off and makes money independent of government control.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-10T14:30:36,26
Wasn’t Spain sort of a dictatorship until a couple decades ago? I wonder if they ever really got rid of those tendencies?,atcmaybe,2025-05-10T15:34:20,12
