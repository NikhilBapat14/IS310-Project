"How are they helping out? I thought being a legally qualifying 501(c)3 held certain protections. You can’t get mad that a bunch of rich people get tax write offs for donating to something they associate with, while churches to the exact same thing. If they are operating within the bounds of the law so be it. Nothing wrong with using the tax code to your advantage. The problem isn’t the school or the church, it’s the government that bends to wealthy special interest groups that advocate for laws they can monetarily back to benefit themselves and their benefactors. All these laws are legal money laundering, ways for those of means to avoid the penalties of ignorance. That’s the problem with this country, our government has failed to uphold their requirements to serve us. They only serve themselves and their own interests, all of them.",Adras7us_,2025-04-16T20:15:30,506

"The elite shouldn’t get tax write offs and religious organizations should have to pay taxes on their assets. The elite abuse write offs to the *n*th degree, and it’s free to worship, however if you start organizing and buying property then you should have to pay taxes on it like everybody else in this country. Otherwise more and more of the tax burden gets deferred to your average joe taxpayer and our debt continues to skyrocket. Moreover, religious exemptions enable what are essentially for-profit scam “religions” like Scientologists and televangelists to make off with people’s money, completely tax-free.  So much of the national budget deficit could be erased if we addressed the abuse of these write offs and taxed real estate owned by religious orgs like we do every other piece of private property. We could perhaps actually address our $36,000,000,000,000 national debt, instead of just making it worse.",Rook_To_A4,2025-04-17T03:54:42,75

"If my retired veteran grandfather has to pay taxes on his home in his 80s, then so too should buildings of worship. Even a small church with dozens of followers can find a way pay what would be an accordingly small property tax for a small community parish.  Any organization that can afford real estate can afford to pay taxes on it. Part of the reason we are $36 trillion in debt is because we set hundreds of billions of tax dollars on fire every year by not charging religious groups the same tax we levy on every single other piece of private property in this country.",Rook_To_A4,2025-04-17T11:21:28,23

"I think a better question is, considering both are really just businesses under varying levels of window dressing, why aren't they taxed as businesses?  When it comes down to it the taxed class is getting crushed and there isn't much water left in the stone.  The libs have wanted all sorts of idiotic tax code changes like taxing unrealized gains and raising capital gains.  All tools pushed thru under the umbrella of taxing the rich when in reality it's about decimating the taxed (working) class.

"Just to ensure understanding, the only difference between a for-profit and a non-profit is the non-profit doesn't get taxed on their profit.  That doesn't mean they don't have profit.  As of right now all these organizations take in money, pay out expenses, then what is left over is profit.  They aren't taxed on any of that money right now.

"I helped develop the PSPS program for PG&E to prevent wildfires in California, and disaster response is a top priority of the Trump administration as discussed in an [EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/emergency-measures-to-provide-water-resources-in-california-and-improve-disaster-response-in-certain-areas/).

"I see your point, but I don't necessarily agree.  First off, begging is business.  Panhandling can be lucrative.  It's the business of exploiting guilt.   Even running ""charitable organizations"" is big business for administrators who make massive salaries and in most cases almost completely wipe out the donations intended recipients.      Looking at it in a really cynical way, tithing isn't exactly begging.  In some religious communities failure to tithe leads to getting in hot water in the community and consistent failure to do it reduces ones standing and risks them getting slowly cut out.  It's like a club membership fee.  I don't see churches as begging for money, I see them as leveraging social standing using God as their confidence man who doesn't get a cut.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-17T10:14:10,10
