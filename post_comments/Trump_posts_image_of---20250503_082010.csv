The president of the United States should not be spending his time trying to make people scared and angry on purpose for entertainment.   I guess my question is why do they love it so much?

Why do people love the idea of someone holding office trolling so much when he himself has made it clear that it‚Äôs not trolling? For example he has said over and over that running again is not a joke, and they think him saying that is part of the joke.

"It says Catholics voted 56 to 41 for Trump. Not 90%.   Only 90% is that 90% of those who believe abortion should be illegal, not necessarily Catholics, voted for Trump.",IggyVossen,2025-05-05T22:23:50,1
"While it might feel futile to even bring this up, given the mountain of other seriously messed-up things he's involved in, there's another way to look at it. This behavior really highlights a deep lack of emotional maturity in someone who holds immense power over pretty much every aspect of our lives ‚Äì our money, our safety, our health, our kids' education, you name it. What could easily be dismissed as just annoying online antics actually seems designed to drive us further apart, and that's something we really need to call out, loudly and consistently. Just my two cents.",Funky-Buddah,2025-05-03T14:32:52,2
"Is that it? Anytime someone says something that makes more sense but is in disagreement with your opinion, we should go with ‚Äútwo things can be true at the same time?‚Äù And if that fails, we can go with ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù   Trump has a documented history of being unhinged. It goes back to his boyhood. You want us to take this documented personality and some alleged stroke and say ‚Äúboth can be true at the same time.‚Äù How about other factors? He is unhinged, has strokes, has syphillis, itchy balls, is demented, etc etc‚Ä¶because after all, all those things CAN be true at the same time.   Take a position and defend it.   We can defend trump being unhinged as part of who he is, we cant defend the opinion that trump has a stroke. Stfu.",Lanky_Trip968,2025-05-03T16:53:09,0
"I‚Äôm never angry with Trump tbh. I know he‚Äôs the poster child for the bs going on, but we all know he isn‚Äôt smart enough to draft an eo. he wouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to take communion so this pope stuff doesn‚Äôt bother me either. he‚Äôs fos    it‚Äôs every other person propping him up that brings out new levels of rage in me. I‚Äôm  very much looking fwd to the next Congress because this bs will finally be over. impeach remove convict. no pardons just fucking jail or hell.",Creepy_Meringue3014,2025-05-04T04:26:39,1

"I mean it makes sense. They probably feel like they have to go above and beyond to even compete. Isn't Catholicism not only older, but larger?   I'm not sure how much of the divide exists in practice, Catholics definitely like Trump, by and large.

"That's just Catholics. Look at the article again, they are saying 56% of Catholics voted Trump and of them, 90% of the ones that are against abortion voted for him. Which, isn't how I put it anyway so it's a correction anyway. Thanks. :)",Johnhaven,2025-05-06T15:57:08,1

I just meant dementia could be making things worse. People with dementia and/or brain damage can become aggressive and unpredictable and that‚Äôs a problem since trump was already a dumbass and a douche long before dementia came into the picture.   Some of the things he‚Äôs been doing just seem‚Ä¶off. Like that rally where he spent the better part of an hour doing a weird old man dance to Ave Maria. He shouldn‚Äôt escape responsibility or punishment for anything regardless but it is worth noting that a malicious idiot and a malicious idiot with a dying brain are not the same situation.,currentmadman,2025-05-03T17:34:42,6

"So you have some examples of right-wing Catholics and think that they represent all  Catholics? Well, Biden is a Catholic, so is AOC, so is Sotomayor, so is Pelosi, so were Jack, Bobby and Ted Kennedy, so were... the list goes on.

"Most Catholics are conservative, Catholic voters grew for Trump in 24. Token examples of liberal or progressive Catholics don't change the broader point. I'm not making a qualitative statement about Catholicism there, but to act like Catholics as a whole aren't conservative and that conservatives don't like Trump are incorrect.",WhiteWolf3117,2025-05-04T16:26:25,1
