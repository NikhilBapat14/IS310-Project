The left will scream they are the good guys while openly talking about murdering their political rivals.,hillmon,2025-04-18T21:14:46,31
Some liberals are getting so brainwashed that they actually think they can call for the murder of people and not have any backlash whatsoever. I guess that's what happens when the left celebrates that CEO murderer like you some hero. I'm sure kids really love learning that killing CEOs is a great thing. That didn't work too well for that college kid did it?,BossJackson222,2025-04-18T12:45:49,35

"The Democratic Party is broken. They haven't had any rational, popular policy initiatives since at least the Obama years. Since Trump came down the golden staircase in 2015 they have merely become the TRUMP IS EVIL AND MUST BE STOPPED party. They have brainwashed millions of people to believe this and shouldn't be shocked at the political violence their stance has taken. If there were any rational people left in the party they would be transitioning hard to 2028, and making their case why their policies are better than the Republican Party's policies. They can't do that, so they continue fundraising on their Golden Goose, Trump.   I just can't fathom why regular Democrats don't see this.",HereIGoAgain99,2025-04-18T11:53:54,63

"After the Army, I did a year and some change of a Student Affairs grad program, my hope was to work in the Veterans & MilItary Services office at the school after completing the program.
