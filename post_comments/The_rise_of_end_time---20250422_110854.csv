"The term ""movement"" grossly underplays what will likely need to be done to stop these people.",Psephological,2025-04-22T11:12:08,15
It's all of the right. Maga is a  dooms day cult,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-22T11:20:00,13
"Jeez, don't say 'end times' fascism.  It makes it sound like this is the final chapter of the United States.  We need the hope that the next chapter will be better because otherwise the book ends and we will be placed back on the shelf to be forgotten.",dbag3o1,2025-04-22T11:20:08,3

"There doesn’t get to be another chapter. This is it, things today are better than they’ll be tomorrow repeated until we actually finally hit the bottom.  The people wanted pain and suffering, so instead of just at their enemies, we all get to suffer and rot.",idkwewtfytho,2025-04-22T12:09:55,7

"People have talked about end-stage capitalism, but I think it's end-stage humanity. I was raised with ""The Rapture"" hanging over my head. I abandoned religion by age 14, but the shit that's going on now has the same feeling of dread as being forced to read, or being preached to from, the Book of Revelations.",Relevant-Situation99,2025-04-22T11:52:23,-4
"The US is not the world, it may collapse but the rest of us will be fine, it’s going to hurt and it’ll take us time to rebuild but they’ll end up isolated and alone while the rest of us work together",lapayne82,2025-04-22T12:32:48,4
"Well, depending on how the US collapses, it may drag the whole world down with it. Don't forget they have the second largest nuclear arsenal which isn't exactly something you want floating around between numerous splintered factions in conflict with one another.  To say nothing of Trump tripping dick-first into WW3 and smashing the button when things go south due to the firing of anyone competent from the United States military.   Thanks America, the rest of the world *really* appreciates what you've done. Truly.",AdmiralRon,2025-04-22T14:07:07,0
