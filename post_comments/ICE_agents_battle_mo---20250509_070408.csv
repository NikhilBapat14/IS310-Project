They say what they mean and there is a vivid muscularity about the way they say it. They admire everything about them without reserve or pretence or scholarship. They are always the first to put their hands in their pockets. They press you to visit them in their own home the moment they meet you, and are irrepressible, good-humored, ambitious, and brimming with self-confidence in any company.

"During the Elián González custody and immigration controversy in 1999–2000, several Republican lawmakers sought to grant the boy U.S. citizenship or permanent residency to prevent his deportation back to Cuba. The leading figures in this legislative push included: 	1.	Senator Connie Mack III (R-FL) – Mack was one of the most vocal proponents of granting Elián U.S. citizenship. He introduced legislation in the Senate to do so, arguing that returning the boy to Cuba would be returning him to a dictatorship. 	2.	Representative Lincoln Díaz-Balart (R-FL) – A Cuban-American congressman from Miami, Díaz-Balart played a prominent role in the public debate and also pushed for legislation to grant Elián citizenship. He was deeply involved in efforts to keep the boy in the U.S. 	3.	Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) – Also of Cuban descent and representing South Florida, Ros-Lehtinen supported the bill and was active in the campaign to prevent Elián’s return to Cuba. 	4.	Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL) – McCollum introduced a bill in the House to grant Elián U.S. citizenship, stating that it was a way to honor the memory of Elián’s mother, who died trying to bring him to the U.S.  ￼  These lawmakers argued that Elián, whose mother died trying to bring him to the U.S., should be allowed to remain and grow up in a free society. The legislative efforts ultimately failed, and Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the boy returned to his father in Cuba, which was carried out after a dramatic federal raid in April 2000.",GerbilArmy,2025-05-09T10:59:25,1

His relatives in Florida refused to release Elian.  Eventually, their house was raided, a significant photo was taken, and Elian was returned to his father. Elian is now a politician in Cuba.  So, he had a parent to go back to. A parent who wanted him back. He was allowed to stay with relatives while his case was working though the American courts. And when he was repatriated back to Cuba, he was put in the custody of his father.  If his mother had survived the trip, she would have had parental rights herself.

As the institution of slavery developed in the Southern colonies, so too did the need for a specialized policing force to control enslaved populations. Slave patrols were established to enforce slave codes, suppress uprisings, and apprehend runaway slaves. The slave patrols, while a specific form of policing aimed at controlling enslaved people, contributed to the development of broader policing systems in the United States.

"Okay, see, that's all the history that I flattened in my post. Very well written.   Just because we're on the subject: My understanding is that this was the start of officialized police in the United States, although it ended up being modeled after the Roman version (like a lot of what we do) established by Crasus. I think that's how his name is spelled. The guy who started the fire brigade that would steal people's houses and then got apocryphal gold poured down his throat. Anyway it was never clear to me if the various police departments were established by state governments in accordance with the classical model and then they hired former slave catchers, or if the state government literally just deputized the slave catchers and the Roman theory of policing was put into effect afterward.

"Good question. My understanding aligns more with the latter, though the answer is a bit more complex due to how policing systems evolved in the North versus the South. In the South, police departments often evolved directly from slave patrols (among the first state-sanctioned enforcement bodies in the colonies). These weren’t formally “modeled” on Roman systems until later structural reforms.  In contrast, Northern police departments emerged to manage urban disorder, like labor unrest, immigration, and social control, not to police enslaved people. So the systems arose from different needs. While the South’s transition from slave patrols to formal policing was more functionally continuous (essentially deputizing slave catchers), the North imported a more abstract model of public order from Europe, particularly from Sir Robert Peel’s Metropolitan Police in London (1829) which itself had some classical influences.   Any Roman influence, such as the Cohortes Urbanae or Vigiles, was retroactively grafted onto U.S. police philosophy as departments bureaucratized and sought classical legitimacy, especially in the North.",jdanielregan,2025-05-10T10:17:21,1
