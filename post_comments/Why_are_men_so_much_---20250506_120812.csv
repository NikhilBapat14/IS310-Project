"Three reasons-  1. Men and women have different intelligence distributions. They are about equally smart, on average. However, there are far more “extremes” than with women. More men have IQs over 150, and more men have IQs under 85. Thus, a much larger percentage of men is literally too stupid to know better  2. Men have been systematically targeted by right-wing influence, which has been amplified tenfold by algorithms. You like MMA? Here’s Joe Rogan. You like Joe Rogan and pseudo scientific bullshit? Here’s Jordan Petersen. You like his thinly veiled misogyny? Then you’ll love Andrew Tate. This has caused a generation of young men to grow up inordinately conservative compared to other cohorts at the same age.  3. To the extent white men have been disproportionately favored previously by institutional mechanisms, they are the biggest losers in a more egalitarian society. Their wives can leave them for being assholes. Women and minorities are further empowered to call them on their bullshit. For every action, there is a reaction. Right-wing figures have figured out a way to harness this resentment for their own gain (One of the biggest predictors of being a Trump supporter is being a divorced male).  Number 2 is, far and away, the biggest reason. But they are all inextricably interlinked.  Edit- There is an honorable mention here  The latest generation grew up fully engrossed in the “meme culture” of the internet. Young men are, biologically, stupid. Their higher reasoning isn’t fully developed until their 20s. And, like a lot of young people, they often take pleasure in putting other people down for their own amusement. This used to be relegated to schoolyard bullying, but has turned into “trolling” on the internet.  The modern GOP is the ultimate troll, with the trolliest troll to ever troll as its supreme leader. The party of free trade and the moral majority is gone. These people don’t care about any real political policies. They just care about “owning the libs.” That’s why nobody turned on Trump when he went against everything the GOP party previously pledged to stand for.  And trolling is, in my experience, an overwhelmingly male phenomenon.",Hello2reddit,2025-05-06T12:25:32,25

"Because men are struggling with their identities, with how to be a 'real man' in today's society and are desperate for answers. While there are some voices on the left trying to help them those are largely drowned out by all the voices on social media telling them that they're terrible, or that their problems aren't important, or they should just shut up and enjoy their 'male privelege', or they just need to figure it out themselves, or something something 'toxic masculinity' something something 'patriarchy'. Just look at the comments on any Facebook post that touches on male issues. Heck look at some of the comments here in this thread. Also the left loves to go on about misogyny but a fair chunk of it outright refuses to accept misandry also exists. So men, especially men who spend most of their time online, feel abandoned or shunned by the left.   On the other hand on the right there are plenty of people willing to go 'we hear you, we recognize that you have problems, and we're willing to give you solutions to those problems'. Are they bad solutions that will hurt more than help in the long run? Absolutely but they still fulfill the need to be heard and have your feelings validated which is something we all share. That's why I was excited for Tim Walz being Kamala Harris' VP because he would have been an excellent public example of positive masculinity from the left but that didn't work out. ",Mr_Meng,2025-05-06T12:45:33,8

"I can't speak for older men but I can speak for the younger ones:  As someone who went through the whole 4chan alt right pipepline from 2009 until about 2020 these comments are mind boggingly far away from the truth and shit like this will only galvanise young men into voting right wing.  Also very interesting to see one comment in particular go on about IQ and genetics. That's shit I saw on 4chan posted about races and here on reddit it's totally fine to just call men low IQs and too stupid... Yeah, we still have a LOT of work to do.  The truth is that young (especially white) men have been politically neglected in the 2000s and 2010s and as a former young white man myself that feels like shit. The alt right was about the only movement back then that explicitly adressed that demographic while selling beautiful narratives and scapegoats. While everyone else ignored their issues, the new right had it extermely easy to just scoop them up. No resistance whatsoever because no one else gave a shit. But as I said, most are in denial about this. There have been some attempts in the Harris campaign to try to adress young white men but it felt incredibly forced, along the lines of ""oh damn, young men are voting right wing, maybe we should start caring about them too.""

"Maybe because we've spent a decade talking about 'toxic masculinity', till people started using it as a cudgel against men in general as opposed to specific actions and behaviors by certain men.   Also because the (social) media landscape is tilted to the right and many online channels who aren't designated as political outlets feature right wing talking points more often than left wing ones   https://www.mediamatters.org/google/right-dominates-online-media-ecosystem-seeping-sports-comedy-and-other-supposedly  Also a weird observation I made is: new books or book recommendations feature almost exclusively female authors and protagonists. Men are nowhere to be found. Maybe people in the manosphere aren't big readers anyway, but it's indicative of a bias. It's just a personal, very anecdotal observation I made in 3 month period I was looking for new books to read.  I think those factors can be deeply alienating to (young) men who are looking for role models or trying to figure out how to be a man in today's world. It's no surprise that the manosphere is synergizing with the MAGA movement though. It's the politics of (imagined) grievances. The fear of being replaced and marginalized by a society that seemingly celebrates femininity and distrusts men.  *Note: I never felt this need for specifically male role models. I hold progressive beliefs, believe in equality and find the manosphere ridiculous, but also threatening, just like the far right in it's entirety.

"I think it’s a response to women being more front and center in media, in politics, in many aspects of their lives where men had traditionally been role models. Young men want to see successful men and look up to them and try and become them. When they loose that representation they look elsewhere. The men that espoused the traditional catchy things like power, wealth, attractiveness to women happened to be propped up by Conservatism/Republicans. Liberals and Democrats, went the opposite way. In the past 80’s and 90’s you have very masculine action hero’s or general role models who had those traditional male characteristics, were ladies men, but still held and demonstrated what today would be liberal values, like equality/equity, etc. Young boys looking for those role models just pick up on what popular culture tells them what men should be, but it’s the popular culture that resonates with them. You’re always going to have the young boy that looks up to the man’s man. It what values that man’s man hold behind the chiseled bod, awesome fighting abilities, cool swagger, and common sense.

"This is an unpopular opinion, but look through my post history, you'll see that I'm not some red pilled dude: I think it's because of the backlash from the MeToo movement failing for women, especially in Gen Z men and white men in general.  It's really not a secret, the sects of men who are veering hard right feel like they are either wrong for existing or see any attempt at equality as an attempt at oppression.  First of all, MeToo has redpilled a lot of men. Let me put in perspective as to why. While MeToo was a necessary movement, I feel like it touched a strong chord that was hidden in plain sight that had a lot more nuance than women really gave it credit. The chord being, ""What is SA?""  Now, that was wholly defined as pretty much any action where physical boundaries are crossed where it is perceived, in retrospect, that woman could not have consented. I am not saying this definition is wrong, but I do not think the world, and especially men in general, were as receptive to the fallout of what answering that question in a public sphere entailed.  I want you to think back a few decades, and if you are young and, on this site, I want to give you some perspective. Ask yourself this ""prior to the 2010's what do you think was the biggest advice given to young men by their mentors on how to get lucky?""  Pretty much any sex comedy in the past few decades will answer that. You put yourself in a situation where everyone can get a little tipsy and make your moves while the vibes are good. The thing about consent from a legal standpoint, unless someone has given their express consent ahead of time, consent cannot be given when intoxicated.  MeToo brought this up ad nauseum with thousands of stories of women who felt they were violated in places like college and bars and festivals etc. And loudly and clearly shouted to everyone who would listen how the men who did that were R words.  Again, I am not saying this is wrong, but now you have a movement where quite possibly the most common way to get laid is being touted as that individual being an R word. Something that pretty much every man was taught to do by every adult man in their lives.  It's that introspection that caused an enormous backlash against MeToo, and a big reason why certain sects of men are now going hard right. Coincidentally, it's also why White Women somewhat backlashed against it. Because for many of them, that's just the game to get a good husband. The demographic that has a decent majority of R supporters are non-college, somewhat-college educated White Women specifically. They were essentially born into a patriarchal society, especially in the South. So, they ""play the game"" to get a good husband. It's why 55% of them go Trump.",zappy487,2025-05-06T12:30:17,0

"The article points to the opposite conclusion. Men who are more online and less social are more progressive and vice-versa. I would also say the poll here doesn't fully capture the shift. What it's showing is mostly that religious conservatives abandoned a kind of semi-acceptance of liberal norms around gender prevalent since the late 80s/90s with strongly anti-feminist beliefs.

"Absolutely, that's a significant factor.  When men feel genuinely safe within a group, you sometimes see more relaxed, even physically affectionate, interactions among them that might otherwise be suppressed.  My time in the infantry illustrated this perfectly.  You'd see guys in incredibly close quarters, relying on each other, engaging in physical camaraderie, sometimes to a degree that might look *queer* or *questionable* from an outside perspective, things like close proximity, back and ass-slapping, or even more casual physical shenanigans because they had trust in each other.  BUT, the moment anyone dared to make an accusation, or even a suggestive joke about them being a possible homosexual, the reaction was often immediate, and violently aggressive.  It was like you insulted their honor, it was a visceral lashing out fueled by intense insecurity and the fear of any perception of being gay, or *acting queer* in a context where rigid heteronormativity was enforced.",temporarycreature,2025-05-06T13:06:44,5

I don't think thats true. I think it just boils down to cultural progressives were often antagonistic towards young men on the little stuff (man-spreading e.g)  and that successfully antagonized them and made them less progressives on the big stuff. I think fairly reliably if you were already a convinced liberal by 2013-2014 you were probably not polarized by a little bit of bad faith politics by the left.

"The idea that masculinity itself belongs to straight people is part of why there are so many ridiculous divides IMO. It feels a bit like a lot of gay dudes have internalised criticisms and stereotypes about masculinity and femininity, and they don’t realise how damaging it is, as it leads that this sort of dynamic.  And a lot of right wing people are also obviously gay/bi, and so I always find it interesting that people assume this isn’t the case.  In an actually functional society, you shouldn’t necessarily even be able to tell if someone is or isn’t, and it shouldn’t matter. And so by trying to link politics and sexual orientation it leads to spiralling extremism and polarisation.  So I don’t think what you said is necessarily true in the way people portray it, and IMO, often a minority of noisy gay dudes themselves can often be the worst for obsessively trying to out people and make everything about who isn’t or isn’t gay, and that can actually inflame tensions and cause more problems and divisions around these topics.  So IMO the log cabin republican types for example can sometimes be more insightful, because they can exist in both spaces, and so they sometimes sort of by definition have more first hand perspectives of both extremes.  I think people who make their sexual identity their entire identity often lack perspective on issues of politics because they will often live in a bubble, and so a lot of left media is essentially just people repeating a lot of extremely carefully chosen words all basically saying the same things in a circle.  I used to listen to a lot of left wing podcasts where they were from a left perspective but more academic, and often many would have gay hosts and so they would often have interesting and slightly detached perspectives on many issues which I found resonated and interesting.  Now thought it seems like so many have become openly bitchy politically radicalised catfights, where they just call people ugly and nobody learns anything. It’s like club culture and the clique mentality took over a lot of gay culture and so a lot of media in a way that IMO is sort of self defeating.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-06T13:13:52,2

Modern science shows no evidence that IQ is a meaningful measure of intelligence.",Mutant-Cat,2025-05-06T13:34:44,3
"This is so crazy.  This idea that left = intelligent, right = stupid is a ridiculous take and doesn’t really make any sense, and is extremely indulgent.  If it were really the case, then why can’t the left elect the best leaders who are able to win voters and navigate these issues?  I think the left also has a lack of understanding of tactical voters and there’s this weird thing where if someone consumes any information from certain sources, they are considered “right wing”, and there’s a lack of understanding that listens to =/= subscribed to every ideas.  And so there’s this strange meme on the left where everyone talks about right wing media or figures, but if they apparently have never consumed any and don’t listen to anything ever, then how do they actually even know what they’re being told is actually true or accurate?  So you then have this bizarre dynamic where people will confidently decry personalities and give these long speeches about how dumb they all are, but they’ve never actually listened too them, and so they’re basing this on other people listening to them, and then summarising this to them?  But then logically, if the people who they are listening and then are warning about them, why can they listen to it and not be considered “stupid”?   So in reality surely the sign of intelligence is being able to listen to multiple conflicting viewpoints, and to hold multiple ideas at once, without necessarily having to get upset about it because it’s just information. If you don’t listen to anything of these people then you will not understand other people. It’s why so many people who are now considered “right wing” who used to be left wing saw so many issues ahead of time, they called so many surprise elections, because they actually listened to what actual people listen to!  Regarding point 2, I personally have listened to some of who you mentioned, but maybe a few hours total, and party to see what it is others are listening to. And in a way I get it, but if you look at podcasts more broadly the same pattern is emerging. A lot are just producing long form interesting background conversation for while people are commuting or at work etc.  People like them because they’re interesting and even if you don’t agree with even 90% of what they’re saying, and don’t hang on their every word, and you understand misinformation tactics and talking likes, some of them are still well presented discussions and interesting. You can listen to many of their debates and think, oh that was interesting even if some of it was wrong or you don’t agree.  I don’t understand what is so hard to understand about this. It’s why they’re popular.  So I think on the left there’s this fundamental misunderstanding of this, and this rush to diagnose people who don’t seem to align with them as “stupid”.  And so you even see this going into lots of left media trying to “dumb down” their existing ideas and are basically repeating talking points from years ago, but now it’s like they’re aiming for a lower reading age, so it’s sort of unbearable to listen to because it’s like “yes I know this, this isn’t interesting or new, why are they all suddenly talking weirdly”.  And if they’re also politicised, there’s only so many times you can listen to people all saying the same thing.  And so on the right if you actually listen to Jordan Peterson for example, they don’t do this. They don’t treat their audience as if they’re stupid. They often talk quite quickly as they’re trying to get their ideas out faster than they can speak, and they often spend a long time exploring an idea and so working on an idea live, and so it’s more like an actual debate and so it’s interesting. Sometimes their guests are borderline almost hostile and so will disagree.  My favourite podcast used to be Pivot, and they had/have a center/left and center/right host and that dynamic is better IMO because they will often disagree, and so it more enlightening as you often get two opposing hot takes. The vibe has changed and it’s more overtly politicised now, but the market demands it change so.  But I noticed even this used to upset people because of the existence of any pro capitalism or centre/right opinions at all, and so some people considered this to be “right wing propaganda” even though they would criticise the right 90% of the time.  So it’s like a lot of left media and audiences demand a totally closed information environment, think anyone who finds intellectual stimulation and debate interesting is secretly evil, and so this leads to everything becoming the same, and so it’s less enriching in a way, and therefore less interesting.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-06T13:54:05,2

"This is just so obvious I genuinely can’t tell if this issue is women trolling men at this point because they think it’s funny. The UK has the same media currently and this issue is always reported as if they’re pretending to not understand.  I used to be considered left wing and knew some Bernie bro style people, to the point where people would on occasion call me annoyingly left, an annoying leftist etc.   But then I think because some people wanted to outdo others, the left just came incredibly absurd, and I knew people who would just start to adopt positions and say things that had absolutely no connection to reality whatsoever, but they would sound a certain way. Almost like people were doing impressions of what they thought leaders should sound like but it was all just so ridiculous.  And some of them actually knew what they were saying was totally unconnected to reality, and it didn’t seem to bother them at all. It was so strange.  And so I noticed a lot of online and offline spaces started to become more like this, and I think some of it was driven by people who thought “the right wing lies all the time, so why can’t we, fight fire with fire”, and so they would knowingly just make things up and start acting like political cartoon characters.  They would then start to talk about what other people “really” think, and it would always be the opposite of what people actually said and believed and would always just be so reductive.  They would then start to just assert and label people as right wing without any reason or explanation. If you spoke to anyone on the other side you’re now dead to them. And so people who have the exact same opinions were suddenly considered extreme right, and would be harassed for it in the real world, despite never actually saying anything about various issues.  So it’s almost like the thing about how sometimes fascists know what they’re saying isn’t true, it’s like some people on the left learnt about this, and basically started to mirror the behaviour totally unironically and didn’t see the issue.  And so normal people were suddenly labelled as extreme/dangerous etc, and so eventually those people will start to search online for WTF is happening, and then google etc will then send you down rabbit holes, and then you end up listening to more right wing voices who will obviously explain how they see issues. And so even if you don’t agree with 90% of it, it is still interesting as they will occasionally say something insightful that helps explain some of what is happening.  So it’s like in a way, the alt-right pipeline sometimes actually starts from the left, and some people for whatever reason push people into it.  And because there’s so much third party monitoring of what you read and listen to, if you ingest various viewpoints and discard 90% of it and understand when they’re going too far and not being truthful, but you still listen for the 10%, then AI and data brokers will all label you as “right wing” too.  And so I assume some data brokers are partly responsible for various politically motivated dramas and leaks you see online, as they may categorise someone as far right when they aren’t, but that’s what their models say and so this is what gets leaked, and then social groups will turn on them.  I think it’s why there’s such a strong backlash if anyone ever uses a phrase like “left wing fascism”, because on some level some of them know what they are doing, and so they have to have an aggressive zero tolerance attitude to anyone who notices, and so it’s like a symbiotic relationship between the two extremes because ultimately politics is a business to many people.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-06T12:38:33,0

So many personalities and media outlets now see their job to educate and convince of a very specific viewpoint, and everything must be around that. You also have attempts to bring in a lot of new people, and so you then have this strange situation where people who are clearly not actually very familiar with a topic almost pretending to be experts, and so it then becomes very inauthentic and strange as a vibe.  If you actually understand some of the theory about the topics, then you will notice when topic is being talked about in bad faith or when they’re being intellectually dishonest.  So if you’re already aware of various political issues  then in a way, there’s almost no point engaging or consuming some media because you already know exactly what they’re going to say about any given topic, and so what is the point?

I think this is a tail wagging the dog explanation. Most generic media of the 2010s was liberal. Most young people were liberal and most content on platforms was liberal particularly if you exclude Facebook which by the late 2010s was not as widely used by young people. Moreover platforms were more likely to censor conservatives than liberals. The information environment for an average young person was left of center. If you wanted to see more conservative content you could but you sort of had to seek it out. My feed didn't have a lot of Andrew Tate in it pre-Elon Musk buying Twitter. So mostly content made people who were conservative more conservative and vice versa but the actually growth of conservatism didn't have much to do with media influence and happened largely in spite of it. There are exceptions like Joe Rogan who had an initially somewhat apolitical audience but I don't ascribe awesome powers of persuasion to a handful of podcasters. I think they were persuasive to men who already disliked progressivism rather than leading men to reject it. Because there was a demand for more right-wing content as young men were becoming more right-wing it grew rather than vice-versa.,somethingicanspell,2025-05-06T14:37:32,8

Look I'm not saying it's easy to better yourself, I know that firsthand, but the fact that it's hard shouldn't be an excuse for not even trying.   I also think you're ignoring the fact that there is a directionality to all of this, as in not trying is actually advantageous to men, because it allows them to keep oppressing women, or even to try and revert some of their hard-earned rights so they can have even more power over them, and they can get some of their old privilege back.

The media was always left-wing. I think the difference was Trump was so abrasive there was no way of pretending to be objective. It was pretty clear that the media regarded Trump as the anti-christ and they were probably right whereas the attack on Romney and McCain was more passive-aggressive.  As far as censorship goes. I think the reason the conservative elite concluded they should burn the system to the ground was 1. Trump forced them basically but a  fairly close second was the absolute efficiency and ruthlessness that every sizable institution in the country moved to crush conservative dissent towards gay marriage which scared the shit out of them.  I sort of support that effort but I think basically you showed conservatives you could use the super-structure of the state to crush them like bugs and thats not a threat they were going to ignore going forward. If you read the kind of seminal conservative political pamphlets of the Trump era its very clear thats what worried elite conservatives the most (Anton is also very racist I don't think Ahmari is)   [https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/)  [https://firstthings.com/against-david-french-ism/](https://firstthings.com/against-david-french-ism/),somethingicanspell,2025-05-06T17:33:34,3

"Women have been supporting women *because* they have been oppressed by men. Men have not been oppressed by women. The key to fixing this is to have men take accountability and remove the oppression, so that women no longer have a reason to support other women because of that oppression, and *not* to ask them to now also support their oppressor unless they want to be even more oppressed (and telling them that they would be responsible for that). Hell, there are even women right now denouncing the ways the patriarchy hurts men too, even before they themselves are freed of the patriarchy. Don't you think once the oppression is removed women will naturally support men too? Are you even hearing yourself? Both sides cannot be equated here  Edited to add: honestly, I'm a feminist and I'm one of these people who keep telling everyone that the patriarchy hurts everyone, not just women, men too, etc etc. And honestly, it's becoming harder and harder to advocate for men when they keep telling us we are the problem for just trying to be awarded the same rights and respect they are.

Men are on average lonlier than women.  Sneaking in an EDIT: I forgot a BIG one: Men even have an overall shorter life expectancy.

To my mind that should be taken into account in this type of conversation too)  The issue you're mentioning, of differing socialisation, is of course an issue for men, but it is also one for women, as I'm sure you know. Teaching women and girls to disregard their own feelings and emotions and prioritise other people's, particularly men's and boy's. Women and girls not being diagnosed as autistic, as another example. And, when people mention it to explain men's behaviour, it sometimes feels like they're saying there's some sort of magical key that men are not given, and therefore they can't be held accountable for their choices and actions.  Of course society and our upbringing influence our choices, but to mention only that when we're talking about such issues is a problem, as it negates individual responsibility.
