"The fact that ASSOCIATED PRESS got kicked out while Russia's TASS (Russian Kremlin media) got access to the oval office is insane in the first place. Absolutely insane.   AP has always had high standards. AP and Reuters both, they didn't deserve this. I'm glad the judge is standing up for free American press.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-08T17:34:35,12
