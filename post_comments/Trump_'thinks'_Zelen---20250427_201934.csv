"So ignoring all that Trump has done to betray Ukraine and suck Putins dick. And how personally I want Ukraine to drive every damn Russian off of every last inch of Ukraine. Crimea is not going to be Ukraine ever again, like it just isn't. That is the one part of Ukraine that Russia would willingly burn itself to cinder over, it's just too important as a military base, and Naval yard; and Ukraine does NOT have the military strength right now to take it by force. I understand why Zelensky can not and will not ever admit that publicly, but it's the truth. So all wishful thinking aside, if surrendering a part of Ukraine that has not been under Ukrainian control for over a decade now; closes the war, and lets other countries be able to set up defensive treaties with Ukraine. It might be an unpopular, but correct decision.",OnlyRise9816,2025-04-27T21:38:42,5

"Without the force and power to enforce the constitution, it is just a piece of paper with a bunch of words on it.  Would the Ukrainian constitution forbidding Russia from invading do anything?",xibeno9261,2025-04-27T21:14:36,-6

"If this is your opinion,  you're not paying attention.  The relationships of powers around the world are fragile things in the best of times.  Right now,  literally everyone is massively building up their military powers. This is not the best of times.  There's the Russia/Ukraine/Europe issue,  China/Taiwan and the South China Sea issues, Israel and Gaza, Iran, longstanding tensions between historical rivals like India and Pakistan... you add Trump's destabilizing actions to any of these tinderboxes, and nuclear winter becomes much less far-fetched than any of us want to believe.",SquirrelMost7063,2025-04-28T00:52:56,2
