Oh dang. It thought the title said Hegseth himself was leaving,yesitsyourmom,2025-04-24T15:44:25,30
"If you aren't following the Hegseth incompetence drama too closely, this is his chief of staff Joe Kasper.  His reassignment was known 5 days ago, but shifted from ""that's fake news"" to ""we meant to do that"" two days ago.  The other leaders and senior staff who have been purged, fired, or quit, that's a whole mess.   Wait for Maggie Haberman to bring us all up to speed in the Sunday Times.",Aghast_Cornichon,2025-04-24T15:46:50,22
When will Hegseth leave the Pentagon?,jackytheblade,2025-04-24T15:47:10,7
"Man, this has been the longest 100 days ever! Everyone hydrate and eat healthy! We are gonna need too! Funny thing is that I don’t hear my usual suspects bragging about how great of a job Trump is doing. I had to hear how America was back after the inauguration. For a month, nothing but felon and how doge was doing great things. Now? Nothing but crickets.",nopulsehere,2025-04-24T15:55:24,8
"So Trump 1.0 his whole cabinet is a revolving door. ANd Trump 2.0 he has more power over the federal gov, so the entire gov is a revolving door.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T15:44:22,3

Is his wife becoming his new chief of staff? Is that why she's with him at work just hanging out?,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-24T16:02:09,2

Goodbye to a shitty guy that did a shitty job. He still needs a lengthy prison sentence. Is that more likely now that he’s no longer a part of the administration?,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-24T15:48:27,1
"Was he part of that group of 3 or 4 guys, or is this an addition?",WHSRWizard,2025-04-24T15:57:03,1
When they cut him off at the bar.,1984isAMidlifeCrisis,2025-04-24T16:32:34,3
"My state subreddit used to be so full of posts by people proud of trump and thrilled that he won and blah blah blah. Literally nothing for over a month now. Zip. Zilch. Nada. And for those of us who are still posting, they will no longer answer or respond to anything we say. This is the biggest sign I know that tells me that there's a lot of embarrassed people out there right now. We used to have a group of regular trumpers that constantly argued with us about everything. They have literally disappeared.",Ande64,2025-04-24T16:19:26,8
"My reading is that Kasper won the backstabbing competition last week that led to the jettisoning of several senior leaders under accusations of being ""leakers"".   But that victory was short-lived.  Kasper was formerly chief of staff for Rep. Duncan Hunter, whom you might remember from ""vaping Congressman"" memes, indictment on campaign finance embezzlement, blaming his wife and his mistresses, and a Presidential pardon.  My money is on Duncan Hunter being the next SecDef, and Kasper's triumphant return to the Pentagon.",Aghast_Cornichon,2025-04-24T16:16:14,5
"Tell me about it, I’m in Florida! Normally you see all the trump flags on people’s boats. I guess they flew off during the ride over to the sandbar! Two of the guys I hang around with are in the roofing business. They have definitely changed their tune. I know that one lost 5 of his crews. He hates the people who come across the border but has zero issues having them work 1099 for him? Stupid is as stupid does!",nopulsehere,2025-04-24T16:33:42,6
"That's a pretty good prediction, tbh.",WHSRWizard,2025-04-24T17:57:42,2
