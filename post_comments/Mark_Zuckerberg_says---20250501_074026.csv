"Funny how it was never necessary with any other president. How would every other president you could just go about your business and not have to make personal corrupt back room deals.  Mark Zuckerberg is a modern Max Nauman and deserves every bit as much fucking contempt.  More even, since Max was not super rich and didn't have the resources to fight the Nazis directly so it made a little bit more sense for him to bend the knee.",Deinosoar,2025-05-01T07:48:23,34
There is never a good reason to insist on a good relationship with an authoritarian regime. Especially one run by a dementia ridden grifter that is ruining business for his own gain.,Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-05-01T07:49:43,16
"Thankfully my relationship with Zuckerberg has been over for a while now. Turns out, it's not necessary at all. So keep brown nosing Trump and we'll let you know how we feel with our feet. Bye!",zeelandicum,2025-05-01T07:49:52,6
It is the first time in recent memory that a large company bows to government rather than try to force its policies by buying the political agenda. It feels like corporate corruption is taking a backseat to fanatical political ideology.,Khorondon01,2025-05-01T07:50:23,3

Exactly. The fact that he's openly talking about how he needs to do 'deals' with Trump shows that:  * He knows Trump is much more of an authoritarian than any of the presidents Zuck criticized for 'censoring' his platform * He also knows that the simple solution is corruption,HarwellDekatron,2025-05-01T09:38:43,7
"Zuckerberg would do the same thing if he had Trump's charisma and cult following, so it's just part of the game to him.  Birds of a feather.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-05-01T10:27:25,2
