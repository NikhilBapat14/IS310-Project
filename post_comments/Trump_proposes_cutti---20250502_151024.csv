The top most wasteful department… getting even more spending. As if we need proof this administration is not actually interested in cutting “waste and fraud.”,ShadowNacht587,2025-05-02T15:12:57,12
"A raise in the military budget, while simultaneously cutting DOD civilians, proposing large cuts to uniformed personnel, and drawing back from our defense obligations overseas...so where is this additional defense money going? Straight into Elon's pocket?",Cdub7791,2025-05-02T15:19:42,5
If he cared to make an actual dent he would go after the insane contracts we have for defense that's where all the fat is,Panda-Armada,2025-05-02T15:15:29,3
"Meanwhile: ""[Pentagon can't account for 63% of nearly $4 trillion in assets](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/pentagon-audit-2666415734/)""  This administration is deeply unserious and incompetent.",Arcendus,2025-05-02T15:31:04,3
"When you're threatening or actually using military force on at least 7 fronts, you've got to scraped together every defense penny that you can. So much for calling ourselves isolationists.    Seniors won't get ""Meals On Wheels"" and people won't have NarCan available   when it's needed to save a 15 year-old's life because they made a bad decision, but so be it.",invalidpassword,2025-05-02T15:31:26,2
"But we've already cut all the waste and fraud out right, so the only thing left would be valid, necessary spending, so what necessary things does he think we can do without?",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-02T15:12:16,1
That’s quite the increase in defense spending.  I don’t see where these “tax breaks” are going to be beneficial if we’re all in a recession.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-02T15:26:29,1
"So, where does all the money go they get.  My oldest son was telling me about the trash weapons, vehicles, and everything else when he was in.  He hurt his knee and after months of saying it was a hamstring they discharged him medically.  Took a long time to get back to ""normal"" but he did still have a knee issue.    My second oldest son was always telling us about poor equipment.  He has been at several different bases as well.  My 3rd oldest, the very same shit.  Just different locations.  Doing a job their vehicles kept breaking down and they would have to wait for another arrival to get them.  Get the vehicle back for repair.  Repair that is never good.  Over and over.  Friends of theirs here in the states and at bases in other countries talk about it as well.  Spending is that high and yet often they see other countries have better vehicles and other equipment than us.       Has to be a lot of waste.  But then, we see contracts with corps that have friends in government getting huge amounts for simple things.  A hammer for so much over retail it is embarrassing to put here.  It is such a mess lining the pockets of these military contractors while our troops us plenty of subpar equipment.",GuerreroUltimo,2025-05-02T16:13:26,1
Sounds like his birthday present... with the parade and all...lol...,AK49Logger,2025-05-02T18:22:51,1
"I swear we have the HIGHEST defense budget in the world, and they want to increase it!? For what, more golden hammers and contracts that don't go anywhere?",DaFoltz77,2025-05-02T15:19:40,4
Well said!,Putrid_Wait7181,2025-05-02T15:16:09,1
Have to pay the foot soldiers well so they don't think twice about shooting their friends and family during protests.,Foolishstars,2025-05-03T00:32:47,1
