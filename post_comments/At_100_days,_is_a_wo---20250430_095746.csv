"This title is weird, ""wounded Trump""? Is his presidency a shit show so far? Yes. Do he or his supporters realize that? No, because his policies haven't affected the average American yet. Some government workers and immigrants have been deeply affected but Joe Schmo living in Alabama or Idaho thinks he's winning and owning China, Mexico, and Canada.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-30T10:03:48,4
"Yes.  He won’t let truth, public disapproval or reality stop him from turning America into Christian Iran.",Electric_Conga,2025-04-30T10:04:10,2

I'm wondering Trump made the 100 days. I thought he would have beeen thrown out of office already.,Diligent-Wave-4150,2025-04-30T10:30:08,0
"I was stabbed so many times, so many, you wouldn't believe it. Nobody in history has been stabbed more than me, not even the salad guy, so great.      On the other hand, at least Caesar got the respect to being stabbed face to face, even by his own ""son"".    But I can't see anyone with a spine around him, which would be needed to act and know what the word ""respect"" means.",Sir_Richfield,2025-04-30T10:38:37,1
