Are you paying attention Chuck Schumer?,rit56,2025-04-23T16:54:23,54
"It's an excellent move. It simultaneously nips the sort of infighting that plagued Republicans in 2018/2020/2022, while also resolving the octogenarian oligarchy crisis we've been dealing with that got us into the present mess we're now dealing with.",SayItsNotSableye,2025-04-23T17:52:29,11
"He’s being praised for doing something that, honestly, should have happened sooner. Every day Americans retire far sooner than these people in government.",RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-23T17:02:11,29
"Meanwhile other democrats are ""appalled"" that people are trying to primary them. I wonder why people want you out. ",AskRedditOG,2025-04-23T17:08:19,9
"He's retiring ostracized for being Schumer's whip, failing to unify votes, then affirming the continuing resolution with the Senate Democrat leadership core.   Good riddance, but... thank you for accepting your era of politics is over and moving on.",nerphurp,2025-04-23T17:00:20,15
If you can take social security you shouldn’t be allowed to run or keep office. That shouldn’t be unreasonable.,BasilCupitch,2025-04-23T22:35:06,3

They are praising him hoping others will take note and retire at a reasonable age.,Professional-Can1385,2025-04-23T17:18:46,28
"I think in general ~65 should probably be the upper limit age for most elected officials at time of taking office. That means one could enter politics in their 30s, 40s, or even 50s and still have a good long career, if their constituents so wish it.",Cdub7791,2025-04-23T17:09:48,16
Durbin is 80. He shouldn't still be in power.  Boomers have held on to power as long as they possibly could.,partypants2000,2025-04-23T18:53:22,7
"our govt is a luxury retirement home they don’t wanna give up that.   they want the money, the gifts and the power. why would they give up that? i wish we had strict term limits so you can live through the consequences of your vote either it be good or bad. someone who makes a decision at 70 won’t live to see it in 10 years MAYBE.",Akraxs,2025-04-23T18:20:05,4
"And there it is!  Incumbent could coast in his current role until he literally dies in office, but decides to step down and let a younger senator have a shot, and some highly educated redditor who complains about old people in politics still fuckin' *complains* about the old guy retiring.",AbsoluteZeroUnit,2025-04-24T02:44:31,4
Oof.  Do not give them more incentive to fuck with the age caps on social security.,lurkslikeamuthafucka,2025-04-24T00:09:14,2
Disagree. Ppl are not toast at 65.,2-wheels,2025-04-24T07:47:54,2
Nothing stopping him from resigning.,FeedMeYourGoodies,2025-04-23T21:25:23,13
I understand. My point was that he should do the same in 4 years. Step down for someone younger.,rit56,2025-04-24T11:12:53,1
More than likely Chuck will get primaried.,MeatPrestigious3597,2025-04-23T17:00:10,4
"That’s not even a boomer man, that’s silent gen",SpaceLemming,2025-04-24T04:38:21,2
Fair enough. But neither of those statements I made are untrue.,partypants2000,2025-04-24T19:02:40,2
"Oh I know, I was emphasizing the problem you were pointing out by the fact he’s so old he’s not even a boomer",SpaceLemming,2025-04-24T19:04:40,1
"I understand.   Things like this remind me of The problematic but very intriguing idea that Thomas Jefferson had regarding getting rid of the Constitution every 20 years, because the children shouldn't have to live under the rules of their fathers and they should be given the opportunity to create their own laws.  When we have the inertia of so many holding on the power for so long, Not just in politics but across industries, you Don't have to wonder too hard why we seem to be looking backward more often than forward.",partypants2000,2025-04-24T19:29:55,2
