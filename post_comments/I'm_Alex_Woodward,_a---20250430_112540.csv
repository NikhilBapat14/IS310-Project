"In the 1930s, the Nazi regime of the Third Reich seems to bear remarkable similarities to Trump's government on a wide range of issues.  The use of concentration camps (CECOT and other ICE detainment facilities), the scapegoating of vulnerable minorities as the source of the nation's ills (Latinos, Haitians, migrants of all stripes), attacks on transgender and queer populations, dismissal of expertise and knowledge that contradicts party dogma (woke vs. 'Jewish science'), aggression towards neighboring countries (Canada, Panama, Greenland, Mexico), entwinement of leadership with corporate leaders (e.g. Krupp v Musk), emphasis on breeding the next generation ($5000 baby bounty), the crackdown on free press, the destruction of social safety nets, etc. all seem to be hallmarks of or publicly expressed aspirations of Donald Trump and his administration.

"I think that’s the big question, and why immigration and civil rights lawyers are focused so intensely on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Say someone who was legally permanently in the country but was swept up in a so-called “collateral arrest” during an immigration enforcement action, or a raid, and that person was put on a bus and then a plane for El Salvador. Trump and administration officials contend that there’s due process for that person to challenge what happened to them, but that’s after the fact, and contingent on a cooperative foreign government. So the mantra among Democrats and other critics has been if it can happen to him, it could happen to anyone; if someone like that is denied due process, then nobody has due process. Obviously the focus from the administration has been on the allegations around Abrego Garcia, which if substantiated in a courtroom could likely end up with his withholding order revoked. But that didn’t happen, and most if not all of the allegations against him haven’t been introduced in court documents in his current case.  \- Alex",theindependentonline,2025-04-30T12:32:42,30

Seeing the fealty displayed again in the cabinet meeting was simply grotesque. Bessent, Rubio, Bondi, it was just stunning to see them roll over and play dead on command.   In closing, cause I don't want this to be a rant, it appears that with congress laying down in the manner it has, SCOTUS has zero authority or power checking ability.",Thin-Competition3018,2025-05-01T06:39:54,1

"We’ve come a long way from bipartisan support for a “pathway to citizenship.” Polls show most Americans support border security broadly, but the trick is getting into specific questions. Polls show voters support removing people living in the country illegally, and leading up to 2024 elections even suggested support for mass deportations. But I think a lot of those results were misleading. It’s difficult to capture the complexity of the immigration process (shout out immigration beat reporters), and there’s a lot of muddled ideas about what people would consider “legal” when it comes to one’s status, and how they got it.If you break down Pew polls from 2024, you’d see 56 percent of registered voters “strongly or somewhat” favored mass removals, while at the same time, majorities were backing “allowing undocumented immigrants to legally work and stay in the country if they are married to a US citizen” and the ability to “stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met.” Polling analysts seemed to think it’s not so much a contradiction as it is a clear misunderstanding of what all those things really mean. So I think a few things are happening: Republicans are banking on broad support for something largely misunderstood but aren’t gonna ditch the president’s agenda out of fear of losing that support and also the support from the president and his allies.  \- Alex",theindependentonline,2025-04-30T13:17:06,16
"(For any folks reading, USMS here is the US Marshals Service.) Good question. At this point, judges haven’t held any administration officials in contempt, and they haven’t asked any marshals to haul officials to court to respond to court orders.

"This whole episode involves a lot, starting with the much-criticized way federal law enforcement identifies gang members. The allegations against Abrego Garcia are mostly being played out in the court of public opinion, and seemingly nowhere on the docket in the ongoing case challenging his removal. The government has not raised allegations of abuse and human trafficking to defend his removal in front of federal judges or the Supreme Court. Allegations of his membership in MS-13 stem from his initial immigration court proceedings that led up to a judge’s order withholding his removal, and those have been revived in the latest proceedings.      ICE guidelines for identifying gang membership are sort of a checklist, based on at least two “gang membership identification criteria,” including tattoos. (ICE has redacted criteria from its guide, which if you wanna read,[ is here](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/handbook_HSI_18-03_08.13.2018.pdf); similar criteria was used to identify alleged Tren de Aragua members under the Alien Enemies Act.) Otherwise, ICE defines a “gang member” as someone “who admits to being in a gang or who has a gang-related conviction.” Abrego Garcia was initially identified by an unnamed informant, backed up by his clothing (Chicago Bulls gear) and tattoos.      So the tattoos became a big focus publicly, and right-wing social media accounts started to speculate that tattoos on his hand are code for MS-13. Then the Trump administration put out a photo, clearly putting those letters and numbers on his hand in an apparent attempt to decode them. I am now not sure whether Trump realizes that’s what happened.  \- Alex",theindependentonline,2025-04-30T13:05:33,9

The current budget proposal would give them billions more dollars over the next several years. The current arrangement with Bukele is allegedly $6 million. But it also seems to be the administration’s idea of a deterrent, which Bukele also intended when he built it.

I think this will all depend on what happens with their cases in the U.S. and if the administration plays ball. There have been a lot of cases filed across the country after the Supreme Court effectively told the Trump administration that Alien Enemies Act removals can continue only if those targeted have a chance to challenge the allegations. Lawyers in the initial case playing out in Washington D.C. [recently filed an amended complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.101.0.pdf) asking the court to order the return of everyone sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.

Denaturalization can happen for things like treason, enlisting in a foreign military, and lying on an application for naturalization, and there’s a lot of due process involved, but if they were to try to do something sweeping, the administration would likely rely on some other justification (e.g. Alien Enemies Act, etc.) to try to jam them through.  \- Alex",theindependentonline,2025-04-30T13:37:26,4

"Real good question. I was a reporter in New Orleans at the time, and there was a lot of uncertainty and fear around immigration policy in immigrant communities during the end of the Obama and beginning of the Trump administrations, and really similar conversations than we’re having now. In short, Obama inherited Bush-era machinery for a mass deportation agenda and ultimately deported or returned about 3 million people, largely focusing on people with criminal convictions and people who recently crossed the border. Trump reversed the prioritization policy, so there’s been a wider focus on all undocumented people. This term, he also suspended asylum claims at the border and some legal immigration pathways, so there are also fewer people entering the system.
