"This is either an admission that Ossoff is a difficult candidate to beat or that the primary would be a problem. Or a little of both.  This does open up that primary for more people. I kind of hope MTG makes a run for it, but the last time I hoped an unelectable republican would win a primary, we got Trump in the White House.  MTG in the senate would be beyond awful.",travio,2025-05-05T13:39:08,52

If Kemp is smart he will sit out of '26 altogether. Claim he taking some time off for family because IF we have elections in 26 the Republicans are gonna get defeated in the polls badly and he run for Senate in 28 against Warnock.,No_Consequence_3118,2025-05-05T14:53:57,4

Still not a guaranteed win for Ossoff but it just got a lot more likely.,Zeddo52SD,2025-05-05T13:54:33,7
Good news.,timeknew,2025-05-05T14:29:01,3

"Man, for a split second my brain lit up at ""Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passes""",Grantagonist,2025-05-05T18:10:13,1
"The people saying he’d automatically beat Ossoff are full of shit.  He beat a terrible Stacey Abrams candidate in 2022, in a mid-term environment that was not good for Democrats, though they did over-perform. He won by a little over 7%, which isn’t THAT great.  The GOP are going to get murdered in 2026 and Ossoff is pretty popular here….  Personally, I hope Ossoff’s challenger is Marjorie Soylent-Green. Last AJC poll had him up by almost 20% against her. Further proof that she’s only popular in the ass backward district she represents.",LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T13:45:30,15
with MTG as their nominee i predict it would be over D+10 vs Ossoff with the bad environment for the GOP + the fact GA continues to move leftward,ShreckAndDonkey123,2025-05-05T13:43:12,10
"No, he’s eyeing a run for President in 2028, I’m pretty sure. NYT reporting he’s still fundraising - and he’s term-limited as governor in GA so it’s not for that. My guess is he thinks he’ll be pressured in 26 to either repudiate what he did in standing up to Trump in 2020 or face a vicious primary with public bashing from Trump and MTG. Both would be bad for a presidential run, so he’s choosing to wait.",dont-pm-me-tacos,2025-05-05T14:47:17,4
"If Kemp chose to go, it would've probably cleared the field.    This makes GA-Sen start as tilt D regardless for next year. I'm not sold MTG would make it out of the primary, and other candidates wouldn't be quite as well known.",95Daphne,2025-05-05T13:53:59,3
"Kemp is insanely popular in Georgia, and polling shows him as the only candidate that handily beats Osoff in a senate race. Him not running is insanely good for democrats.",TobioOkuma1,2025-05-05T17:39:18,1
Making sure the Republicans not to have an open primary would be nice.  Getting their most trumpist candidate getting steamrolled would be great.,thieh,2025-05-05T13:50:29,0

"He’d wallop Warnock. Probably the safer play for him to be honest, and he can actually try to do his job for the rest of his term.   He has eyes on higher ambitions though. Not sure if he’ll pivot straight to running for president or take the safter path to the national stage with a sure win against Warnock.",wehooper4,2025-05-05T18:01:43,2
Yea huge boost to Ossoff's chances. My guess is Kemp has his eyes on running for president in 2028.,blueclawsoftware,2025-05-05T13:37:03,15
"Kemp out in GA, Sununu out in NH, and Paxton challenging Cornyn in TX.  Republicans are getting cleaned out of anyone with even a modicum of sanity.",gradientz,2025-05-05T13:55:41,6
"I'm with you. I think he's the strongest republican candidate, which is why they were trying to recruit him into the race, but all the winds are tacking against the republicans and Ossoff has done well for himself.",travio,2025-05-05T13:48:41,6
"Polling shows him as the only candidate that beats Osoff, and its pretty close.",TobioOkuma1,2025-05-05T17:40:44,2
Why was Abrams a terrible candidate? I've heard mostly good things about her and thought she was well-liked in Georgia,IAmTheNightSoil,2025-05-06T01:03:08,2
"To be fair, I’d say ossoff has been a little more quiet than Warnock, making Warnock a little more popular among democrats. It might be a stretch to call Ossoff “popular” down here, I’d say he’s just a senator most of his constituents don’t really pay any attention to.",Corkson,2025-05-05T22:30:10,1
Latest AJC poll had him up by 17% against MTG. She would get absolutely smoked.  Most of the state fucking hates her.,LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T13:46:37,18
Herschel Walker was a fucking dogshit candidate and he almost won in GA in 2022. Don't underestimate the mouth breathers down here.,CassadagaValley,2025-05-05T14:03:08,17
"Paxton is already running in Texas, which probably makes that a D-leaning race as well assuming he wins the primary.  I have a feeling that MAGA voters have gotten cocky and Democrats will do much better in the 2026 Senate races than people currently expect.",gradientz,2025-05-05T13:47:28,3
Well it’d be a Jewish man vs a Catholic so if there was ever a circumstance where people would that would be the one.,camusonfilm,2025-05-05T17:03:22,2
It all depends on how toxic the Republican brand becomes the next few years with the rate things are going,No_Consequence_3118,2025-05-05T18:04:49,4
The guy desperately wants to be President. A Senate campaign never made sense with the amount of resources it would take and the turnaround time from it to a Presidential run.,Goosedukee,2025-05-05T14:13:20,6
Oh definitely,Lantis28,2025-05-05T13:38:42,2
"Obviously it’s a long way to go, but Ossoff lead every GOP candidate the AJC polled against him a couple weeks ago except Kemp, which was a virtual tie.  He even has a 9% lead over a potential matchup with Raffensberger. That should tell you how strong Ossoff is.",LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-05T13:51:34,4
She ran an awful campaign in 2022. Didn’t have the same drive or energy as her 2018 campaign especially given how popular Kemp was at the time.,LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-06T04:05:44,3

"If Paxton wins, it does make that seat more of a threat, but Allred probably would ultimately lose by 2-3%.   This case though (Georgia)? I really don't think you should be concerned about a MTG win here. ",95Daphne,2025-05-05T14:27:31,3
"He's challenging John Cornyn in the primary, so I doubt he wins that. But if he does, you have to think he's the favorite to win the seat, given that it's Texas",IAmTheNightSoil,2025-05-06T01:04:44,1
I haven't really followed Kemp that closely sounds like it isn't much of a surprise then. Thanks for the info.,blueclawsoftware,2025-05-05T15:17:30,5
"Kemp likely doesn’t want to blow his shot on a year that it might not work. He has higher ambitions, so ether wants to go up against Raphael Warnock or toss his hat straight in the running for president/VP",wehooper4,2025-05-05T17:54:12,1
"Aah, gotcha. My opinion of her was mostly formed in 2018, and then by the credit she got for Georgia flipping in 2020. I didn't have any specific knowledge of her 2022 campaign but what you're saying makes sense in that context",IAmTheNightSoil,2025-05-06T10:08:19,1
