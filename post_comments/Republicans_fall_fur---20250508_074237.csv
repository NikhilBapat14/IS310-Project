"I can't believe they actually called the bill that. Also, the bill is outrageous. It just raises more taxes on the poor while giving the wealthiest people a tax break. No tax on tips? Ya now that CEO will make 90k a year with a 12 million dollar 'tip' from the company. No tax on overtime? Ya, they are trying to get rid of overtime, its part of 2025.",Tomrepo92,2025-05-08T07:57:01,44

"If they actually pass this agenda, they will lose elections for the next 60 years because anybody that remembers this, will vote against it.

I'm preparing for this country to go through financial Armageddon this year. The X date when the treasury will no longer be able to pay our obligations is quickly approaching - presumably between July and October and the Republicans aren't going to be able to pass a budget. sigh,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-08T08:00:47,5

No they haven't. There's not one Republican that doesn't think this is fantastic.,Adderall_Rant,2025-05-08T09:53:24,2
Actual research shows and proves that Republicans don't get shit don't when they control the house. They definitely don't do shit to help the working class. 2017 Trump tax cuts benefited the wealthy and that's it. Everything Trump did in his first term caused inflation under Biden. The same thing will happen again. Then a Democrat will have to come in and fix it in 2028 but the short term dumb ass American will forget what Trump did and just blame the Democrat. Then Fox and right wing propaganda media will pump out lies about Dems and the average American will believe it all. Then by 2032 ignorant Americans will vote in Don Trump Jr.,AmericantDream,2025-05-08T10:26:55,2

What's always bothered me about no tax on overtime is do you want your livelihood to be tied to copious amounts of overtime? Working consistently more than 40 hours a week is not a healthy work life balance...and companies dont even like doing overtime if they can help it because they dont want to pay you more lmao   Im also not a fan of no tax on tips either it seems like it would be way to easy to abuse...id be fine with no tax on social security though that one actually makes sense,blues111,2025-05-08T08:09:46,24

"At the very *least*, they can hire you for 4h\day and pay taxes on that, then force you to overtime 4 more hours which are taxless so they pull out less money for the same amount of work received and at the same time you take the same amount but will get less services because less taxes to pay them.

"That wouldn't work. Overtime is work exceeding 40hrs in a workweek, where employers are required to pay 1.5x base hourly rate for non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  If you are a part time worker and your hours are increased but still less than 40, that's not overtime.",Ok-Economist-9466,2025-05-08T09:51:11,3

Question: is the taxes they pay on regular time greater than the difference in Overtime pay?  Also: do they pay more or less taxes depending on the hour-on-contract?,ankokudaishogun,2025-05-08T10:21:23,1
