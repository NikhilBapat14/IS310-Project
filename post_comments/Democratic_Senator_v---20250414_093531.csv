"Just watched interview with David Letterman and President Obama that took place right after his term ended.   It's a Whole New Ball Game Now https://g.co/kgs/jqJoeyd  It was refreshing to see and hear a man who embodied what a President could be, how they could act, and how they could elevate people using their platform.  I hope the Senator has the means to follow up on this. It isn't easy to do the right thing.  Every Congressperson who blindly follows and does nothing to reign in the  unwieldly thrashing of this President and his cabinet will eventually discover their true worth to their constituents.",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-14T10:16:03,71

"Yes. Here's the thing. We're putting all this focus on Abrego, but there are untold people there by mistake who are utterly innocent. What's different about Abrego is he's the only clerical error **the administration has admitted to** but he's certainly not the only clerical error or complete screw up by ICE. Just to name a couple: ICE copy pasted another person's information into man's file, man deported for having a soccer tattoo honoring Real Madrid, man deported for autism awareness tattoo.... There are definitely multiple stories like this.  https://immigrationimpact.com/2025/04/03/men-deported-el-salvador-stories-investigation/  Here's a case of another man wrongly sent with papers signed by a fired crooked cop who now works for the outsourced detention centers: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/04/10/fired-milwaukee-police-officer-report-gay-stylist-salvadoran-prison/83005721007/  So please keep in mind this is about far more people than just Abrego. Him alone coming home (if he does) is not a win. It's simply Trump holding off being pulled out of power for one more day. Of course him getting released and brought back to the US would be fantastic, but these are basically POWs of war that we cannot forget about until they all come home.   So, yes. They need to go there anyway and report back what's going on about *everyone* sent there. The world needs to see. I've seen google images posted showing pools of blood outside the facility. We very well may have reached authoritarian death squad disappearing people levels at this point.",undercurrents,2025-04-14T23:20:23,19

It would be hilariously easy if he cared to get them back. The only reason they take people is for money. Stop sending people/money until they give those back and they will be back rather fast.,okhi2u,2025-04-14T11:41:13,32

"I just read about it.  I am horrified.   This Canadian is shocked and saddened for the people of the USA.  Republicans left it to the President of El Salvador to decide whether he could be returned.  Republicans offered no money for his return.

Instead, Trump told the President of El Salvador that he would need 5 more prisons for all the American citizens that he would be sending.  Republicans laughed at this.
