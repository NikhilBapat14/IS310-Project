"There are two competing lawsuits.  During the Trump administration, a lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups saying that the implementation of Title 42 violated the rights of asylum seekers, and that the Trump administration had not convincingly proved there was a health risked posed by said asylum seekers. When the Biden administration announced plans to repeal the rule, Republican-led states filed their own lawsuit, saying the Biden administration had not properly allowed for notice-and-comment, and that the states would have objected to the repeal of the policy due to the likely increase of immigration increase a repeal would have.  One panel [ruled in favour of the ACLU and other groups](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/16/title-42-migrants-court-ruling/), another judge [ruled in favour of the Republican states](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/20/title-42-border-judge-ruling-migrants/). It is up to SCOTUS to adjudicate these competing claims and potentially answer all of the legal questions at hand (was Title 42 really in the interest of public health, were the proper procedures followed by the Biden administration, etc.).",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-12-24T09:09:46,5
