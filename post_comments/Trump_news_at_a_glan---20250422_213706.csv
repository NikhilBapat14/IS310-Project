Trump blinked.  Did the Chinese trade war even last a mooch?,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-22T21:40:52,18
">But the US president on Tuesday said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said.  On a separate note: Musk is tied to DOGE. It doesn't matter if he ""steps back""; anything DOGE does will forever be firmly attached to him.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T21:39:11,12
"The scam continues. Trump is generating billions of dollars of wealth for his lackeys by manipulating the stock market. Every time he announces new taxes, the market crashes. Then he says he will pull those taxes back. Market goes up. Watch the money.",DoomOne,2025-04-22T21:39:43,10
Convicted fraud Trump has now lost two trade wars against China... and you paid for both.  Americans sure seem to love having their money stolen by a pedophile.,ltcraft05,2025-04-22T21:47:00,8

Is there any country where he didn’t have sex workers pee on him?,OpenImagination9,2025-04-22T22:52:22,3
"Consistency! Trump is already 'very nice' to Putin and other dictators, so he should definitely be very nice to China also.",highfructoseSD,2025-04-23T04:39:38,1
Feels like a mooche and half but I'm pretty sure it was less than one metric mooche,antlestxp,2025-04-22T21:48:52,5
This isn’t over. China doesn’t want to appease him.  He still thinks hes in a position where china needs to make a deal. This is just him flip flopping again. He did the same thing with ukraines president.   “He’s a dictator.” “Oh did I call him a dictator? That’s terrible.” Only to ambush him with JD Vance on live TV the next day in a disgraceful effort to make Zelenskyy look bad.,Angel_of_Mischief,2025-04-23T06:27:46,2
IOW Trump is a cuck and is all talk.,restore_democracy,2025-04-22T22:43:44,4
