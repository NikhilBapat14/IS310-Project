I suspect half of the US wouldn‚Äôt either.,RollTider1971,2025-05-08T09:59:14,264

"Unchecked mass immigration and oikophobia or, a dislike or hatred of one's own home, culture, or country.¬†A symbiotic relationship. üîÑ",Ty--Guy,2025-05-08T19:08:29,15
"For context, a year or so back there was a report that the RAF was not diverse enough and the usual DIE project was launched to correct it leading to "" unlawful, positive discrimination"": (BBC source : https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66060490)",Manach_Irish,2025-05-08T09:38:14,88

"Well, more than half of American men and women are unfit to fight for their country. But I think in the face of annihilation they would change their minds.",Reaganson,2025-05-08T11:28:52,27
"So the Anti-Christ could schmooze in, convince some people, threaten the rest, and Britain is his? I'm guessing most of the rest of the world would be about like this... Sure seems like the time is drawing near.",triggernaut,2025-05-08T12:25:53,16
Well yeah. They're from the Middle East,ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-10T13:31:51,1
How many of us could effectively fight? I‚Äôm an unfit keyboard warrior.  I suppose with enough time and a drill sergeant I could get fit enough.  I do go to the gym. But I know damn well I currently can‚Äôt fight anything but gravity to get off the couch.,esqadinfinitum,2025-05-08T11:25:10,88

"You don‚Äôt need half, the 15-20% who would step up is more than enough to handle any force that would be stupid enough to step on US soil.",Hezakia84,2025-05-08T20:53:36,8

Should make the revolution pretty quick.,Creeepy_Chris,2025-05-08T10:40:50,7
I don't think it's half but I would bet we are at maybe 15-20% that would refuse.,scully360,2025-05-08T10:40:42,0

I‚Äôm going to guess if you don‚Äôt get violently outraged by child rape gangs being called ‚Äúpart and parcel of living in a city‚Äù you probably aren‚Äôt going to fight for anything except the rights of people who came to your country specifically because they allow the raping of children and anyone who calls it out is jailed for hate speech,chillthrowaways,2025-05-08T13:32:49,40
We're nearing the end of our annihilation but people still don't even see it.  England is like looking a few years into America's future.  South Africa is a decade away.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-08T11:59:05,12
"The AC will schmooze everyone.  All nations shall willingly kneel, there will be massive apostacy in churches, and true believers will be persecuted and hunted down.  Given the amount of churches that already are openly apostate and how Christians who stand up for the literal things the Bible says are publicly ridiculed and harassed even among ""moderates"" or self-professed Christians I would say you're right.",codifier,2025-05-08T16:15:04,10
"It all depends.   To train competent, professional soldiers takes a few years. Training a self propelled sandbag to die gloriously for the regiment (aka: cannon fodder) is easy. I can turn any overweight, out of shape, mentally defective meat sack into cannon fodder in a few weeks; the exact amount of time depends on how long you want them to survive.",Dpgillam08,2025-05-08T12:26:44,47
"Yep,  plus the millions that have already served, gotten out,  and would step up to put that experience to work.   The veterans in this country would give any occupier a rough time.",Silly-Safe959,2025-05-08T21:43:23,8
"About 1% of America's population serves; that's been consistent for decades. To get more than that, especially during wars, has always required a draft. And our history records how many try to defy that.",Dpgillam08,2025-05-08T12:14:48,12

"Not necessarily. It takes 22 weeks, including basic training, to complete infantry training in the Army. Even joining an elite unit like the 75th Ranger Regiment takes under a year (about 8 months from basic to getting your scroll). At any rate, a soldier is usually ready to head right into combat after they finish training.  But right now, it's not an issue anyway; we have a large, well-trained, technologically advanced, standing military. If a largescale war were to break out, our current forces could hold their own and then some while new soldiers are trained; we have a large enough country that even if a small percentage of the population is able and willing to fight, that would still be a large, formidable force.",Antisocial_Worker7,2025-05-08T13:43:03,22
"Privates fresh out of boot are minimally competent; there's a reason we don't allow them to operate a dull pencil without NCO supervisionüòã There's a reason boots have a combat life expectancy of 6 weeks (depending on job) while old crusties have an expectancy measured in months.  By the time I've ground ""battle drills"", common tasks, and other vital tasks (spoting, evading and neutralizing booby traps, tracking, basic field survival, etc) into their heads, that takes a few years.",Dpgillam08,2025-05-08T14:55:55,3
