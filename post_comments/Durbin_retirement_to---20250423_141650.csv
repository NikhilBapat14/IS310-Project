Shake Schumer on out of leadership,SoundSageWisdom,2025-04-23T14:20:03,15
Good. The Senate Democrats need to be shaken up.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T14:18:53,8
"Hopefully his replacement hasn't also had all his or her teeth extracted like the toothless, punchless Durbin...",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-23T14:21:01,1
"Durbin was always a key figure, but it was time to make way for new voices. I'm intrigued to see if Klobuchar or Booker actually make a run for the seat, although I don't rule out bigger plans for 2028. What's clear is that this transition will move a lot of buttons in the Senate",HoneyDusk_,2025-04-23T14:23:08,1
Agree. I canâ€™t tell the differences between MAGA and centrists anymore. Both have the most brain dead priorities and are in denial about everything.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-23T14:23:17,0
I fucking hope not. Booker and Klobuchar are corporate stooges and won't change jack shit except the color of the drapes.,Zealousideal_Ad_9623,2025-04-23T14:55:59,6
The prospect of Klobuchar in leadership makes me want to vomit,Random-Cpl,2025-04-24T04:38:10,2
"I understand the frustration, but I think we still have to see what proposals they bring. Sometimes we underestimate what can be moved from within",HoneyDusk_,2025-04-23T15:29:59,-2
Democrats are hungry for change. I'm not sure either Klobuchar or Booker - who the user you were replying to rightly points out owe much to monied interests - are representative of that change.,Tenzin_,2025-04-23T15:39:17,3
