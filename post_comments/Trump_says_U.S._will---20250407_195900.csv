Why would Iran even bother tidying up the house for this dipshit? He already broke a great deal with them. He breaks deals that he himself signs. Everything he says is bullshit and not even worth writing down. ,clickmagnet,2025-04-07T20:02:12,1
Iran is rumored to have said they will meet with His Excellency and Ruler of the World Donald Trump for a 2 day direct in person summit on February 30th and February 31st.,TopEagle4012,2025-04-07T20:07:29,1
Donald Trump well known for upholding his ends of deals. He has immaculate credit and always pays his bills.   Surely Iran will trust him to broker a deal for their nuclear security. Of course they will listen to him     /s,Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-04-07T20:05:36,1

"Hmm, maybe you shouldn't have withdrawn from the working non proliferation agreement with Iran during your first term when you were dead set on reversing Obama era policy because you're a vindictive child.  Keep in mind that Trump's withdrawal escalated tensions between our countries, destabilized the middle east, strained our relations with allies who co-signed on the deal, increased provocations in the region, including confrontations in the Persian Gulf, and all while Iran began reducing it's compliance with the JCPOA by enriching it's uranium to higher levels of purity, allowing the country to upscale its nuclear program.   In fact, recent assessments have shown that Iran now has the capability to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon in a matter of weeks, when it would have taken them around one year under the previous agreement.  Oh yeah, also keep in mind that Trump nearly started a war with Iran after approving The assassination of General Soleimani. This move only destabilized the region further, leading to fears of broader conflict. Congress actually had to pass two historic war powers resolutions to curb Trump's taste for interventionism and mitigate the possibility of war with Iran.   Iran even vowed revenge and retaliated by launching strikes on US bases in Iraq which resulted in traumatic brain injuries for dozens of military personnel.  When Trump was confronted about it, he brushed off their injuries as mere ""headaches.""  What an asshole. The ""President of peace"" everybody!  Since then, Iran has indicated that they still intend to seek revenge against Donald Trump, there have even been reports of assassination plots against Trump and some of his allies.  And on top of all of that, it's likely that these events have only led to increased cyber attacks from Iran.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-07T20:22:28,1
