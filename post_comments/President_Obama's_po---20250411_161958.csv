"There‚Äôs no art in this White House.  There‚Äôs no literature, no poetry, no music.  There are no pets in this White House, no loyal man‚Äôs best friend, no Socks the family cat, no kids‚Äô science fairs.  No time when the president takes off his blue suit red tie uniform and becomes human, except when he puts on his white shirt and khaki pants uniform and hides from the American people to play golf.  There are no images of the First Family enjoying themselves together in a moment of relaxation.  No Obamas on the beach in Hawaii moments, or Bushes fishing in Kennebunkport.  No Reagans on horseback, no Kennedys playing touch football on the Cape.  Where‚Äôd that country go?  Where did all the fun, the joy and the expression of love and happiness go?  We used to be the country that did the Ice Bucket Challenge and raised millions for charity.  We used to have a President that calmed and soothed the nation instead dividing it, and a First Lady who planted a garden instead of ripping one out.  We are rudderless and joyless.  We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great.  We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others.  The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it.  The challenges and the triumphs that we shared and celebrated.  The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for.  We are lost.  We have lost so much in so short a time.‚Äù  -Elayne Griffin Baker",Shirley-Eugest,2025-04-11T22:44:29,5
