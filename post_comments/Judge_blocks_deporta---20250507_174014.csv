">A U.S. military aircraft is expected to transport the migrants who are from the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, among other countries, the motion said.  why the fuck are they not being sent to their home countries? This is straight up kidnapping.",Past-Warthog8448,2025-05-07T18:07:15,44
"I never thought that the ""judicial branch"" might possibly be our country's saving grace.  Of course, it will not mean anything unless these decisions are enforced.  How enforcement takes shape,is anybody's guess at this point.",pj7140,2025-05-07T17:50:04,20
">In one case, the attorneys said in the motion, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at a South Texas detention facility gathered several detainees in a room. The detainees were told that they needed to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya, the document said. When they refused, they were put in separate rooms, ‚Äúcuffed in,‚Äù and forced to sign the document, the motion says.  Another day, another report of ICE doing something that's blatantly illegal! There are never any consequences!!",sachiprecious,2025-05-07T19:01:08,14
If they aren‚Äôt being taken to their country of origin - it is not deportation and we need to stop calling it such.   It‚Äôs kidnapping. Trafficking. It‚Äôs heinous.,thederlinwall,2025-05-07T19:26:55,11
"The thing is, white supremacists don‚Äôt see brown people as people. No one who is a normal person with actual empathy would even consider doing any of this. The Trump administration is led by very fucked up white supremacists.    They aren‚Äôt just white supremacists though. They have the same response to all women, lgbtqi people, disabled people, neurodivergent people (with a few exceptions), and poor people. To them the only actual people worthy of any consideration are themselves and other very wealthy, straight, white, cis men. They make concessions for hot young white women who are subservient and willing to have sex with them and/or have white babies.    That‚Äôs it.   Everyone else isn‚Äôt real, just toys to be set on fire.",Limberine,2025-05-07T18:45:39,11
I am shocked there are so many people willing to abuse human rights.,Silly-Scene6524,2025-05-07T19:20:46,5
The idea of the government sending migrants to a country in the middle of a civil war. We really failed as a nation.,NeoThorrus,2025-05-07T19:47:05,6
Are there no international laws that prohibit this type of thing? It seems so wrong and so illegal on so many levels.,Deep_Seas_QA,2025-05-07T22:14:52,2
"It‚Äôs extraordinary rendition, not deportation. Its disgusting.",Cheesewheel12,2025-05-07T22:01:05,11
"That is what I don't understand about any of this. If none of these people were incarcerated here, then why are you sending people to be imprisoned indefinitely in another country.",Interesting-Risk6446,2025-05-07T22:51:12,5
At this point I‚Äôm hoping some of the military at this big expensive military parade decide to take a crack at saving the country.,Limberine,2025-05-07T18:49:55,6
"We need ICE agents put in prison over this. It won't happen, but its what we need.",GargamelTakesAll,2025-05-07T21:11:56,3
There was also a report this week that the US was going to send migrants to Ukraine!! (non-Ukrainian migrants!),sachiprecious,2025-05-07T19:50:03,3
"Even if there are (which i don‚Äôt know), so what? The US has never cared about international law and the current administration is ignoring all court rulings against them.",Im_a_knitiot,2025-05-08T02:20:40,2
