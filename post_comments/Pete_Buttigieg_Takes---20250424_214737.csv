"I mean, I'd vote for him as a last resort over any Republican but I'd do all in my power to ensure he lost the primaries.  I don't think he's a strong candidate for several reasons even beyond the bigotry he faces for his sexuality. In particular his time as a mayor of South Bend would make it very difficult to win over black voters after he was perceived to have ramped up police crackdowns on black residents, removed the city's black police chief and encouraged their black fire chief to resign to be replaced with white guys, and, oh yeah, the police shooting of a black man who was never charged while he was mayor.  Similarly, we saw that despite being relatively youthful, he wasn't able to make hardly any connection with young voters who mostly viewed him as a sellout, an age group now entering their 40s.  If he takes the field, he has to make up a lot of ground with voting groups that are often difficult to reach and have a preexisting dislike of him - and groups that are absolutely essential if they want to beat the cult forming around MAGA on a national level.  There just aren't enough white voters over 45 to carry a presidential election for him on their own who aren't already part of the Trump cult.  More than that, though, apart from his electoral challenges, I don't want him near power. Everything about his career leads me to believe he is a political opportunist of the highest order and the people who want power the most are the ones I trust with it the least.  He may be smart and articulate, but from his time at Harvard where he displayed dismissive apathy to important social issues in favor of courting politicians and journalists.  Then add his time as mayor, per above, where he had an atrocious record on race and poverty.  Then add his time at McKinney while they were propping up the Putin regime, structuring ICE as it currently is, and expand the opioid crisis and he personally was confirmed to have worked on projects within the US that resulted in mass layoffs in of the low and middle income earners he'd need to connect with now.  Then on top of that his wildly inconsistent policy stances in the 2019-2020 election season, filling his staff with Goldman-Sachs and Google and taking campaign advice and direction from Mark Zuckerberg and that's before getting into the billionaire donor list, and his deal with Biden to drop out and endorse him in exchange for a cabinet position.  Nothing about the man leads me to believe he has a principled bone in his body and right now, more than anything we need someone who's going to fight for the things that need to be fought for, not schmooze with the powerful to fuel his own political ambition.",Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-04-25T00:57:32,-16
