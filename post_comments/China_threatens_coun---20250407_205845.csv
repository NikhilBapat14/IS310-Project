China will never capitulate to Trump. The only ones getting hurt are the citizens in both countries. Fuck you Trump.,IpeeEhh_Phanatic,2025-04-07T21:02:10,1
"In the vast multiverse there's a version of America where April started off pretty chill. Headline might have read ""Rockstar pushes up GTA6 due to steady economic gains in the gaming industry"". Could've had 4 pretty chill years. But nope.",ApplicationAfraid334,2025-04-07T21:05:24,1
This is what China has to do. China has decades long plans. It’s better to resolve this tariff issue once and for all rather than let it linger across decades. ,Fresh_Mountain_Snow,2025-04-07T21:05:03,1
"China has every right to do this.    Trump may not get the message and his sycophant cultists may not get the message, but hopefully enough of his corporate donors and enough Republican senators and representatives who depend on corporate donors will get the message and force through some changes.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T21:12:57,1
"The party of tough on China could have did this without taking on the entire world at once  Had it just been China, we may damn well have pulled it off.  Nope. YOLO. Grandpa chooses nightmare mode with the save deleted on death.",nerphurp,2025-04-07T21:11:42,1
"The initial tariffs were one thing. But this is getting ridiculous. While China is about the only country Trump has tariffed that actually makes sense, a never ending trade war ain't the way to do it.",Blue_ocean_strat24,2025-04-07T21:39:33,1
"Simpleton me, ordering my tea from China. This sucks if prices go up and I can only afford some grocery store teabags.",michaelyup,2025-04-07T21:05:45,1
You're absolutely correct.  China was humiliated by the West during the opium wars in the 19th century when they were weak. They've never forgotten that and they're not weak anymore.   Trump may never get the message and his idiotic followers across America may never get the message. But Republican Representatives and Senators depend on donations from corporations and other kinds of businesses. And businessmen will definitely get the message and put pressure on politicians who need their money.  I'm already seeing signs in both the House and the Senate that groups of Republicans are starting to realize what's happening and are becoming alarmed.  Money talks.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T21:19:16,1
Dream on. There's no multiverse; there's just this universe.   It sucks but we've got to work with what we've got.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T21:14:13,1
