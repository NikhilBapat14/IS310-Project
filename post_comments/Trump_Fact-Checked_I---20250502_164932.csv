"TLDR: Trump has repeated the figure several times in the past few weeks. On Thursday night, speaking to graduates of the University of Alabama, the number hit its lowest point yet: $1.88.  “Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114438304481024140) on Truth Social this morning  Fact-checkers at CNN, PolitiFact, and CBS News were quick to undercut the president, observing that the lowest average gas price of any state was $2.66, in Mississippi, while the national average was $3.19",Murky-Site7468,2025-05-02T16:54:22,187

No.  He just lies.  It's really that simple.,Few-Breadfruit-7844,2025-05-02T17:11:18,18
"By that metric, it was at 1.95 in October of last year when Biden was President. And at that time Trump was claiming gas was 7 dollars a gallon.  So no, he's not looking at the futures chart.",Ctown973,2025-05-02T17:20:29,10

0%. Store owners get such small margins on their gas to stay competitive. No way they would be gouging people almost an extra $2 a gallon if they didn't have to.,captain_intenso,2025-05-02T17:32:17,2
"I wouldn't give him the benefit of the doubt.  People try to justify what he really meant every time only to find out that he did claim/think the dumb thing was true.  Remember when people were trying to say that he wasn't really saying the ms13 numbers were tattooed, but referencing what the tattoos meant... Only for him to prove that he did in fact think they were real.",southwick,2025-05-03T03:44:49,1

It's more like a MAGA would threaten the store owner to force him to give him $1.98 gas.,captain_intenso,2025-05-02T17:30:04,37
">“Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years,” Trump wrote on Truth Social this morning, touting the unsourced claim as evidence that the economy was flourishing under his tariffs.   So from your link the wholesale price was 1.87 on September 10th.  So if he is using this to make the claim he is still lying about it being the lowest in years..",Alternative_Potato67,2025-05-03T06:45:21,12

Remember the unheard of reality in his first term. Due to no demand gas companies were actually paying anyone who could take oil and gas shipments off their hands. That would have been in around the third week March 2020.,westdl,2025-05-02T18:00:45,16
"It's not multiple teams doing this. The GOP is by itself in this.   If Biden did that exact thing, knowingly lied about gas prices to the American people, one time, his Presidency would have ended. They would have called it Biden's Big Lie and it would have taken him down.   And Trump can lie about gas prices every day and it's not even a news story. The playing fields are so unequal.   One team is still playing by the rules and one has abandoned them completely.",SetYourGoals,2025-05-04T13:02:05,1

So the sluths on Reddit already figured out that he's looking at the purchase of per barrel vs what's seen at the pump. Basically he's looking at the wrong fucking numbers.,drklordnecro,2025-05-03T03:40:47,6

So you're saying Biden brought down prices so much in his last 9 months in office that they are still lower despite the 3% jackup under Trump? Huh,Quiet_Property2460,2025-05-03T01:03:41,3
Either Trump has the power to lower gas prices like he claims or he's lying.,TheAquamen,2025-05-03T01:04:51,3
"So you paid $2.50 and not $1.98 or under? What was the point of commenting? What point are you trying to make? ""That's a california problem"" shows an astounding level of ignorance. My mom paid $3 a gallon in south Carolina this morning.",ohheyyliv,2025-05-03T11:26:19,1
"I have a MAGAdolt neighbor who flies a 6ft X 15ft banner on a large garage. Last year, he had one up, shown the Mango Musullini pointing and grinning at a gas pump showing $1.43/gal.

"I'm ready to bet he hasn't filled a tank of gas by himself even once in his entire lifetime.   Not even sure he ever drove anything else than golf carts.  You guys used to elect military pilots, you got better standings back then",Spiderbanana,2025-05-02T21:31:21,9

"If he is using the wholesale price isn't intentional, somebody probably talked about it in a meeting and it stuck to his mind. Not that he did any research or listened to people saying that he shouldn't use that figure.   Or he is just lying. The second option is more likely.",Fenris_uy,2025-05-03T09:05:14,1

George H.W. Bush was a former WW3 navy pilot who flew Avenger torpedo bombers off of carriers. In 1992 at a grocers convention he marveled at the amazing technology of a simple supermarket checkout scanner.

"Yea, I paid $.88 in the late 90s, south central PA. It is such a clear memory as it was dramatically less than I was paying at home, 100 miles away. Thanks to the collapse of the USSR and Russia flooding the oil market with cheap crude, I heated my house for most of the 90s decade, using kerosene and rarely paid over a buck a gallon.
