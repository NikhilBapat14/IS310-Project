"> While the Midwest governor said he would like to think he was chosen by Harris because of his record delivering “amazing progressive things in Minnesota,” he acknowledged a large part of him being on the ticket was to connect with white swing-state voters.  > “I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that, that I could put them at ease,” Walz said at the event Monday.  > “I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look you can do this and vote for this,’” he added.  “Permission structure” is exactly the kind of term an elite consultant comes up with to explain why it’s critical we send Hillary on a black podcast to brag about hot sauce she carries everywhere to secure black voters. “The public needs someone’s permission to support this” and we wonder why they call us elitist lol  Maybe running on Walz’s genuinely progressive agenda that sounds good to people even without someone else’s permission would’ve been a good idea. Also, let’s not forget reporting that showed Harris didn’t want a VP to outshine her… something that’s ironically happening now anyways",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-01T09:15:01,30
"> While the Midwest governor said he would like to think he was chosen by Harris because of his record delivering “amazing progressive things in Minnesota,” he acknowledged a large part of him being on the ticket was to **connect with white swing-state voters.**  I wonder what exactly the Harris campaign was thinking when they decided to put a leash on him midway through the campaign even though he was scoring zingers by going after Vance and Republican leaders with the 'couch' and 'weird' jokes   Well, muzzling him sure paid dividends with the swing state voters...",Ripamon,2025-05-01T09:20:39,7
"Unfortunately, he was shackled to Kamala Harris, therefore he is never allowed any “breakthrough moment” other than the “unexpected” stuff (aka the “weird” comment)  The vp is not allowed to outshine the presidential candidate, and Kamala shine like a broken lightbulb",Automatic-Wonder-299,2025-05-01T09:38:52,3

Clearly he couldn’t “code talk” to white guys. That’s why he lost because neither of them could speak to normal people without all of their talking points they throw into everything.,Signal_Opposite9161,2025-05-01T19:45:12,-1
"You nailed it. Comments like his and using terms like ""permission structure"" when speaking about race and gender and voters is a giant problem for the democrats. People are tired of being put into categories constantly. They want to vote for the best candidates and holding anyone back during the process is just insane. Then people stay home and the rest of the country votes in a crazy man who makes insane claims with confidence.",gustopherus,2025-05-01T09:21:04,15
"The Hillary Clinton hot sauce thing pisses me off to this day. It backfired so spectacularly, and I find that so upsetting because it was genuine. Her consistent and undying love of hot sauce was a known thing, like in news articles, all the way back when her husband was president.    Her husband plays the saxophone on Arsenio Hall and gets lovingly referred to as the first black president for years. She truthfully answers a question and gets shit on for being disingenuous and pandering for the next decade.    Bill unquestionably has more charisma than Hillary, and I get that, but it still pisses me off.",kittenpantzen,2025-05-01T09:24:35,9
"The fucking nitpicking on the left of the left is ridiculous. The guy on the other side told us in a debate that Haitian immigrants were going to stalk your pets and eat them. Meanwhile, the left has to have a candidate between the ages of 35 and 45, not a female but also not a white male, has to be perfectly candid and genuine but at the same time never say anything uncomfortable, be progressive and a centrist at the same time… fuck this shit. There were two candidates and one was serious and the other wasn’t. We sit here making excuses about why the unserious candidate won, but never admit that maybe the ELECTORATE wasn’t serious. We’re getting what we deserve. This was our fault. This notion that the Kamala campaign had to be more perfect when she was running against a convicted felon spewing conspiracy theories is ridiculous. ",porkbellies37,2025-05-01T09:30:53,11
I wish the Democratic Party could get their shit together… ugh.,Tricky-Major806,2025-05-01T10:22:17,2
Everyone here upset about this doesn’t understand that this is how people think. You can get mad about the focus group style shit but it’s true. A massive population is made up of demographic groups and those groups can be moved in certain ways. Some of them are so hard wired to resist certain things (like voting for a black woman) that they need to see other white dudes support one to feel comfortable.   You can be annoyed that people think like this but it’s dumb to not take advantage of it.,ennuiinmotion,2025-05-01T17:02:10,1
"Throw in the fact that I don't vote FOR democrats, I vote AGAINST republicans. Democrats haven't earned my vote in a long time, but I'm not going to sit it out and not vote. That's a way to end up with our current administration.",jtmj121,2025-05-01T18:03:29,1
"It's definitely charisma. It's why two people can tell the exact same joke and for one it could land and cause a roar of laughter, and for the other it could fall completely dead.  Delivery, sounding sincere, timing, general charisma. It matters, whether people like it or not. And Bill comes across as authentic and sincere, while Hillary doesn't even in the slightest.",MrNature73,2025-05-02T00:21:22,2

"> they need to see other white dudes  that they actually trust on their own merits. Just the sight of a white dude doesn’t change anyone’s mind. It’s not as if they want to vote for Harris but can’t until they see Walz. They don’t trust the entire agenda.  If Walz wins them over on his own merits as a more progressive masculine figure first, *then* his appearance has value to those who would be reluctant to support Harris just for being a black woman. Instead Walz is more active and effective now as a media figure without the campaign holding him back. He never got the chance to win trust as someone with a vision of improving lives.   The elitist assumption that average Americans are so dumb they automatically align with those who have the same identity is just a different kind of stereotypical prejudice. It’s what leads Joe Biden to say “you ain’t black” if you don’t vote for him. It’s genuinely confusing for these people to understand why any voter might be more complicated than that, so they have no idea why they’re losing.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-02T12:33:59,1
"Nothing would have worked. That's the point. Prices were still high from the 40% increase in monetary supply from COVID (remember those checks with Donald Trump's signature?), there was a Russian misinformation campaign (Operation Doppelganger) dividing folks on Gaza (both Palestinians AND Jews ended up souring on Kamala somehow), and the podcast bros were more influential than common sense. The public treated the election like a game show instead of an important decision about our futures.",porkbellies37,2025-05-01T11:55:50,3
"I personally think after the failed assassination attempt (which Trump turned into the greatest photo op of the decade, with the ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"", fist in the air bleeding, ""forgot my shoes joke"") coupled with Biden completely fumbling the debate after we were told for like two years he was sharper than ever, the Democrats were just completely cooked. There was no way back from that, short of a miracle perfect candidate and VP, which neither Kamala nor Walz were.  I am worried about the DNC still missing the memo, though, with them electing Hogg as a vice chair. That's winning none of the votes they lost.",MrNature73,2025-05-02T00:19:49,3
