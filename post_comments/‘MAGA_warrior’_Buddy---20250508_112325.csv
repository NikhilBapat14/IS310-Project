"Article is paywalled but you can bypass the paywall by switching to reader mode on your browser.   Some highlights:  > Carter telegraphed his strategy with an opening ad that attacked Ossoff’s immigration stance and blasted the Democrat’s vote against a GOP-led measure to bar transgender girls from competing in women’s sports.  > “Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side. Trump has a warrior in Buddy Carter,” said the ad, which features footage of Trump praising the Georgia lawmaker. “Buddy helped Trump secure our border and put America first. And he knows the difference between a man and a woman.”  🙄  > A former mayor of the Savannah suburb of Pooler, Carter built a reputation as a constituent-focused representative with a knack for retail politics who has honed ties to both the mainstream and MAGA wings of his party.   > Recently, he’s moved even closer to Trump’s orbit, including sponsoring headline-grabbing legislation that would authorize the president to negotiate a deal with Denmark to purchase Greenland and rename it “Red, White and Blueland.”   > Like other GOP contenders from outside metro Atlanta, Carter faces a name recognition challenge in the state’s population center. But the pharmacist has pledged to tap into his personal fortune to help promote his campaign.  > Officials say he plans to spend $2.3 million on his opening ad barrage — and intends to commit at least eight figures to the race.   > His latest financial disclosure shows he has at least $12 million in assets, though his net worth is likely far higher. He also recently reported more than $3 million in his campaign account.   > Carter is just the first of several expected GOP contenders.",HallucinogenicFish,2025-05-08T11:23:44,8
