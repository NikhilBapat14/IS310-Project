"Just as the policy debate over regulating crypto heats up in Washington, Trump will hold two major crypto-related events at the Trump National Golf Club this month.  The first event, which will take place Monday night and is one of the most expensive dinners with the president ever, is the “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner”—a $1.5 million-per-person fundraiser to benefit the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc.  This dinner comes ahead of another crypto-related event the president is set to attend later in May. On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social, promoting a meme coin dinner on May 22, also at his private golf club.  “It’s really an intertwining of personal, business, political fundraising, and government policy like we’ve never seen before,” said Jordan Libowitz from a watchdog group in Washington.
