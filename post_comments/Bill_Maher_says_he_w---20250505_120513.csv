"I would love to see that happen. Trump goes into the enemy camp all the time (ABC, NBC etc.) so why not the Maher show as well.",MrsKiwi66,2025-05-05T12:13:22,6

Of course he would. Highest ratings he would ever have. I doubt there are too many that wouldn’t interview Trump just for the ratings.,neveroncesatisfied,2025-05-05T23:05:45,3
"He had TDS pretty hard and fell for the whole Russia gate thing. He's certainly came around in the past few months, probably because of how nutty the anti trumpers have become but it's kinda not that easy to believe he is genuine this time.",_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-05T13:34:29,3
"He already met him in person and was taken aback at how personable and friendly Trump was.    The 2016-2020 narrative of “don’t normalize anything I don’t like!” is pretty difficult to to yet another 4yrs, and it’s hard to say not to “normalize” the election winner who walked away with a clear mandate.    I’d love to see it.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T12:56:06,8
