"If these firms send their “best people” out to do pretend “pro bono” work, and charge them out at a pretend $2,000 per hour, the fabric of this country might hang on just a little while longer.

So yeah, law firms… please send more people like him:  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/supreme-court-fbi-raid.html  “No policy says don’t break down the wrong door?” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch asked. “Don’t traumatize the occupants? Really?”  Mr. Liu clarified his position. “It’s the United States’ policy to execute the warrants at the right house,” he said.  Justice Gorsuch said, “Yeah, you might look at the address of the house before you knocked down the door.”  But Mr. Liu said that “checking the house number at the end of the driveway means exposing the agents to potential lines of fire.”  Justice Gorsuch continued. “How about making sure you’re on the right street?” he asked. “Checking a street sign — is that asking too much?”  Mr. Liu said the agents had made a “reasonable mistake.”",racedownhill,2025-04-29T20:14:23,9

Forced pro bono work will have firms allocating its most junior lawyers to these cases.   Should the volume of cases detract from its ability to service major clients it will lose them and key staff to competing firms.  Reputational damage alone will be enough to sour existing clients. Attraction of new business and hires along with retention is crucial.

Additionally it isn't realistic to verify that someone can afford to pay for their treatment before treating them. You can't wait to verify someone's credit before you send an ambulance for their heart attack. Also, you can't check for ID when someone's in a car accident before you send an ambulance. So the ER treats everyone and then sends them the bill. If they don't pay it, it goes to the state for reimbursement. Universal healthcare basically allows the poor to get proactive treatment, before it becomes an emergency. When it is MUCH cheaper. Cheap enough to almost cover the additional treatment of issues that will not directly become emergency worthy, but may allow those individuals to earn a living. For example joint pains, bone spurs, and mild back problems.",guru42101,2025-04-30T07:08:06,1
