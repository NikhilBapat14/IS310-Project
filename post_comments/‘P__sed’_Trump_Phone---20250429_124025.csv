"Article snippet:  > President Donald Trump made a furious phone call to Jeff Bezos to complain after hearing that Amazon was planning to display the extra cost being passed onto consumers as a result of U.S tariffs on some products on its website. >  > The president gave Bezos an earful after being told about the move by a senior White House official, reported CNN. >  > Minutes after the call, Amazon released a statement insisting the addition was never planned for the main Amazon site, but it was considered for the budget spin-off Amazon Haul, which sells products under $20.",progress18,2025-04-29T12:40:43,159

"Why in the world wouldn‚Äôt the consumer want to know how much of a price is associated with its actual value of a product and how much is the result of some arbitrary tariff numbers this corrupt administration pulled out of their asses?  Don‚Äôt sellers want to assure their buyers they‚Äôre not price gouging them?  Also, doesn‚Äôt not separating the numbers just help assure the costs of goods will remain higher when the tariffs are inevitably removed?

Prices going up during Covid was rough but we all understood that things happened to cause the prices.

"I don‚Äôt know about that.  My understanding from others on here that are not US Based that a separate tariff tax line is fairly common when applicable so automating this and having it applied to US imports seems standard.  Amazon if nothing is all about automation.  At the end of the day assuming these tariffs are real and the U.S. is charging China and others someone is going to eat the cost and I don‚Äôt see Amazon just doing that and taking losses.

"Doesn't matter. They'll still expect Trump to fix it. (Besides which, plenty of Trump voters were ""people who mostly don't understand anything"" rather than dyed in the wool MAGA cultists.)  It's roughly 30 days sailing from China to the port of Los Angeles. So if he caves on tariffs after two weeks, that's *six weeks minimum* of almost nothing coming in from China on the West coast, and longer on the East coast.
