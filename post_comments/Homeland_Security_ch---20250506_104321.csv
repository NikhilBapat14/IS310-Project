How many years will this drag out? Will it be longer than the line at my local DMV?,0002millertime,2025-05-06T10:45:32,16
Under Trump we no longer view air travel as safe.,BoringThePerson,2025-05-06T11:10:24,8
We’ll discover commercial interstellar travel before DHS actually implements all of the provisions of Real ID on domestic flights.,ScotTheDuck,2025-05-06T10:49:27,6
There will be a courtesy strip search conducted by Pete Hegseth.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-06T10:48:09,2
It shouldn't be a requirement until all DMV centers are able to process Real ID's. You shouldn't have to drive an hour or 3 to one that is able to process them.,Alleandros,2025-05-06T15:27:22,2
TSA sez Air travel is unsafe under Cheeto Benito’s vindictive cuts!    Just bend over and we’ll drive you home.,kundehotze,2025-05-06T11:18:39,1
"Consider this, the Real ID act was signed into law by George W. Bush on May 11, 2005, and the TSA proposed extending the deadline to 2027 roughly 8 months ago that hasn’t gone anywhere. So we are already at about 20 years of this.",coasterghost,2025-05-06T11:14:26,8
As long as it takes for people to check the box on the license renewal form. It costs nothing yet people still don't do it.,Classicman269,2025-05-06T11:00:23,2
With his wife watching.,thieh,2025-05-06T10:49:28,3
"This is the point, they want people who have the least means be more restricted in their movement.",ripgoodhomer,2025-05-07T18:23:38,1
"I think that differs by state. In California, you generally do not need to go to the DMV to get a renewal (and most people do it by mail now), but for the REAL ID you do, so they can take your fingerprints and check some additional documents. When I did this, it took about 5 hours, plus the cost and time of being there on a weekday.",0002millertime,2025-05-06T11:18:56,8
I just got mine and it was $72 and two trips to the MVD because the first time Musk and DOGE had taken over the SSA and the MVD couldn’t verify anyone’s SSN.,MyPartsareLoud,2025-05-06T11:34:01,5
"I had a real id (Colorado drivers license) but when I went to the dmv to get an Illinois drivers license they wouldn’t accept a copy of my birth certificate. So I didn’t have enough forms of ID to get a real ID, (I had my Colorado real ID, SSN card, mail, copy of my birth certificate etc.)   So it’s actually not that easy to get one. And I went from having one to not having one.",WeCameAsMuffins,2025-05-06T11:51:53,4
It costs $50 on top of regular license fees here...,Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-05-06T12:57:15,3
"Getting my birth certificate took $90 and a month but sure, it was nothing. I still need to take a day off work to sit in line at the DMV plus whatever fees come from the license itself.",GargamelTakesAll,2025-05-06T18:44:52,2
"In our state we have to do it in person and bring in documents. I had to get another copy of my birth certificate overnighted as they wouldn’t accept the ones I’ve used my whole life, including to get my first license at the same DMV. So I get to go twice to the DMV and wait.",Significant-Dot6627,2025-05-06T20:17:42,1
"I tried to do it on my last renewal, but the DMV employee said since my old Social Security card was laminated and wouldn’t go through her machine she couldn’t do it. I’ve got a mint new  unlaminated copy of my Social Security card for next year when it expires next time.",Constant-Notice849,2025-05-06T20:23:41,1
And his wife's boyfriend.,williamgman,2025-05-06T10:50:15,6
"wow. It took me an hour, and that hour included me having to go back home because I brought the wrong document. (The sainted DMV worker tried so hard to use the document even though it said it big letters that it could not be used for ID purposes.)",Professional-Can1385,2025-05-06T11:36:10,3
"Interesting in Ohio, all I had to do was check a box well renewing my license. Frankly, it does not surprise me if their are wildly different rules by state.",Classicman269,2025-05-06T11:27:28,2
"When I did mine in California, wasn't that long. I had to request some new copies of documents anyways, like my social security card was deteriorating, and I wanted to get set up for TSA Pre-check, so appointment day, I think I was in and out in an hour or less.   Pre-Check honestly took me longer than my real id.",T0rrent0712,2025-05-06T12:45:12,2
Is the cost about the same as it usually is to renew your license/ID?  I said no cost because it did not increase the cost of renewal at least for me.,Classicman269,2025-05-06T11:39:08,2
"Wow, frankly, this has been eye-opening to the pain of all the states having different rules about a national ID.",Classicman269,2025-05-06T12:09:25,3
"I just checked MN.  It's now $41, up from $27 for the old standard.  Extra $15 to get an enhanced I'd for border crossings.",MamooMagoo,2025-05-06T13:24:48,1
It's Cucks all the way down with Conservatives...,Zahgi,2025-05-07T09:00:02,1
"Yeah, I should have just driven to a smaller town to do it, since I had to take off work anyway.",0002millertime,2025-05-06T11:39:28,2
"That's crazy! Minnesota requires extra documentation to get a REAL ID.  It's not hard, but if you don't have the documents on hand, it's more work.",MamooMagoo,2025-05-06T13:22:09,3
It cost $25 more for Real ID in my state.,MyPartsareLoud,2025-05-06T11:40:30,5
"For printing a little star on your ID, that is just ridiculous.",Classicman269,2025-05-06T11:50:53,2
