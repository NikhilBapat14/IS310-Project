This is not investment. This is open bribery from sources that can remain anonymous to the public. No previous president would have gotten away with this.¬†,3MATX,2025-05-07T09:55:41,129
"‚ÄúAppear to be‚Äù is a strange spelling of ‚Äúare‚Äù  Why are journalists using such mealymouthed words to describe Trump‚Äôs corruption?  For God‚Äôs sake the IAE announced a 2 billion dollar investment.  Not keeping it a secret, so Trump knows where the money‚Äôs coming from.  If this were a Democrat president, Democrats would be leading the charge for impeachment.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-07T09:57:45,38

Don‚Äôt give me any bullshit about Presidential Immunity from last summers Supreme Court decision as it doesn‚Äôt apply.

"I'm somewhat surprised that this is considered news.  My auto-translation of everything Trump has gotten so worn in that I thought they were just being upfront about this.
