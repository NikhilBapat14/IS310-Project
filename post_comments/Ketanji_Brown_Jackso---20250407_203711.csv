"**From reporter Lydia O'Connor:**  Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a seething dissent Monday to the court’s ruling allowing the Trump administration to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants.  “The President of the United States has invoked a centuries-old wartime statute to whisk people away to a notoriously brutal, foreign-run prison,” wrote the court’s newest justice.   What’s especially concerning, Jackson wrote regarding the current deportation case, is that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court ruled under its emergency docket, or “[shadow docket](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/supreme-court-shadow-docket-abortion-climate-election-student-loans/index.html),” without hearing any arguments or reviewing any briefings.
