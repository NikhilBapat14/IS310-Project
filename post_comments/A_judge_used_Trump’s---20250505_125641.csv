">In issuing a permanent injunction halting the enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, U.S. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the order singled out Perkins Coie based on the content of its speech and actions. To conclude that the order infringed upon the First Amendment rights of Perkins Coie and its clients, Howell unsurprisingly relied upon the text of the president’s order and the accompanying “fact sheet” from his administration. But she also did something else far more unusual: Howell used Trump’s subsequent agreements with other firms — and his boasts about them — as evidence against his administration.",DecorativeRock,2025-05-05T13:20:56,115
