">Progressive Democrats on the Assembly Public Safety committee on Tuesday said they worried how Krell's proposal could have unintended consequences that could impact the LGBTQ community, people of color, and older teens in relationships with minors. *Some are concerned that parents could use the proposed change to the state's solicitation laws if they don't approve of their child's interracial or LGBTQ relationship with an older teen.*  ""unintended consequences"" my entire booty (maybe that is my cynicism speaking here)  The context here.  It looks like the fight is over how ""fuzzy"" the bill is around what buying sex looks like, and how you could abuse the bill to prosecute things outside of what it is meant to cover.  Don't like that the 18 year old, who sleeps with their 17 partner, after buying them dinner? Now you can force an automatic felony on them!  Basically it is a fight over what is normally covered by ""Romeo and Juliette"" carve outs. The democrats want it to be decided on a case by case basis. The republicans *seem* to want to sink the entire bill by forcing this amendment to it (it *looks* like a hostile amendment to me).  You would hope everyone would want a bill which makes sleeping with under 15s a felony, but the repubs are trying to screw with it for political gain (or worse)  It's the usual political bullshit which goes on here, you forcefully add something which is designed to be problematic, and then claim your enemy is against the non problematic parts.",CryptographerKlutzy7,2025-05-05T01:47:00,34
everyone agrees with this. now present a bill with clear language that can not be weaponized in bad faith.  washington examiner is a conservative publication. they are biased in that they would support that weaponization.,Virbillion,2025-05-05T02:16:52,25

The Washington Examiner poses an interesting question:  >In what scenario is buying a minor for sex not a big deal?   The answer it seems is:  [It is okay if you are a Republican.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1103p6y/western_ohio_mayor_resigns_days_after_arrest_for/j87bxqc/?context=3),Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-05T01:51:47,25
And that’s not what democrats oppose. The entire issue is the wording of the bill. If it was more specific and couldn’t be weaponized it would have passed already.,Demonking3343,2025-05-05T03:48:17,6

"I am glad that the Examiner has finally come around to that opinion. I don't think Democrats were ever opposed to that being the case, and it seems like common sense to most normal people, but it doesn't matter how long it takes to get to the right answer, so long as you get there eventually.",KeviRun,2025-05-05T01:35:30,14
"I thought chattel slavery was already illegal. However, the Washington Examiner is telling me that, unless the bill passes, anyone can buy minors... even for use as a sex slave.

"There's virtually no scenario it isn't already, unless the offender is rich & powerful... I'm sure *this* law would totally change that!

"Yes, I agree it *should be*!!! But that isn't what the amendment the republicans pushed looks like.  It isn't that overall it isn't a good idea (because it is), it is that the specific implementation pushed is almost designed to be badly written.  The fight isn't over ""should these people have protection"", the fight is over ""this language lets people push automatic felonies in situations it shouldn't""  Using the statutory rape laws as a template would have worked.",CryptographerKlutzy7,2025-05-05T01:56:29,21

"""Presumably it is about prostitution of minors.""  Yes, in which case the language needs to be really clear to make sure it doesn't extend outside that.  The fact that the language really isn't, and can be abused to do some pretty horrendous things is what the fight is over.  It isn't that people don't want it not to apply where it should, the fight is over making sure it can't be applied where it shouldn't.  If you can use it to jail your 17 year old's, 18 year old partner because you don't like his skin color, then it is bad law.  That's the fight. Not if prostitution of minors is a bad thing, because it is, not that prostitution of minors shouldn't get you a felony, because it should.  But because it spreads out past that. It needs a language cleanup, then people will all vote to pass it. (unless it was just there to act as a spoiler - which I expect it was)",CryptographerKlutzy7,2025-05-05T02:01:25,25

"It should be further noted that statutory rape laws are a very rare type of law that use strict liability for a felony charge. Typically in the US, for felonies, we like to use either general or specific intent. Mens rea is a requirement for almost all felonies, except statutory rape. Have to really get the wording correct if we’re going to be charging people felonies for acts they may not have intended or knowingly committed. For statutory rape, even if a minor has a state issued ID saying they’re 21, and they’re sitting in a 21 only bar drinking, if you sleep with them, it’s a crime.    Usually, only low level crimes like jay walking are strict liability.",LowellForCongress,2025-05-05T07:18:29,3
