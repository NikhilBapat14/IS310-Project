"You'd go to the site for the legislature of that state, and dig around or search for the voting records.  You'd also need to find the exact bill numbers for the laws which enacted such rules.  Then you'd look up how those politicians voted on the specific bills involved. You could also find the info in a library, as legislative proceedings are generally put out in book form as well.   here's the wisconsin legislature voting records for a year, so you'd also need to make sure you have the correct year of passage of the law to find the voting records. https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/related/votes",zlefin_actual,2024-06-13T08:12:00,3
