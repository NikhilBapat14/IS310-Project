"Well, it's just that the elections lately have truly been close. If one party blew the other party out, then it would be clear earlier on, but when the majorities in both Houses will be determined by possibly as few as one or two seats, then of course we have to wait until the last one or two seats are counted to know for sure who wins.",mormagils,2022-11-14T09:58:44,2
