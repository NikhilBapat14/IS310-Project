I love the language they have to use to get Americans to understand the significance of what is occurring to their economy.,Wide-Secretary7493,2025-05-06T09:08:34,8

"That would be foolish, but only by doing it in one go. You will definitely see central banks offloading part of their USA treasuries simply because the trade war means they need fewer dollars and because the USA can no longer be trusted to manage its own economy, and may not even honour its debt. What happens if Trump starts (purely hypothetically) a global trade war that threatens to fatally undermine the USA economy and the dollar?  What happens if Trump sees a rage tweet about ""those foreign creditors"" and decides to include them in his ""revenge""? WHat if he gets into a fight with the USA's national bank and takes it over or gives it to one of his cronies? What happens if Trump invades Greenland or Canada and ends up at war with some of its creditors? Nobody knows, and slowly but surely that will have an impact on the desirability and cost of USA debt.   The truck may be rock solid and well maintained, but if the new driver is a maniac driving it straight towards a cliff, then that won't matter much.",barryvm,2025-05-06T09:20:19,4
You don't dump all of them but if you are trading significantly less with the US you don't have as big a need for US dollars so of course you dump some of them over time.,Purify5,2025-05-06T09:14:46,3

"T bills, WMFD, weapon of mass financial destruction.  Play that card and it is MAD, mutual assured destruction.  I believe the Japanese are not that reckless even though I am sure they would love to shove a T bill up Trump’s dinner dumpster.",TubeframeMR2,2025-05-06T09:10:40,1
The BRICS members holding U.S. debt possibly could try to collect. Hopefully not though.,_MrBalls_,2025-05-06T13:13:25,1

"I'm pretty sure it won't be the Japanese (or other countries with massive debt bonds) who will start, it will be the US going too far.     It's damocles' sword hanging over the US economy. Actually many swords.",kaas-schaaf,2025-05-06T09:16:01,2
