"This is like asking why so many Americans are unhealthy or homeless. There isn’t one answer so there isn’t one solution. Like we chose 70 years ago, to standardize on the car for our transportation. This dramatically reduced how many homes and how many people can live on a given acre of land. So the potential for new home is less. But that didn’t directly cause the slowdown in home building around 2010. That was was because of the banking crisis. Which was the result of deregulation years before.   We also have policies that make construction harder and density harder. Including current owners who like the value of their property to go up. We also decided as a society to make home ownership the basis of both most personal wealth and the engine of the economy itself. So everyone’s looking at it. There’s also so much extra money at the top with nothing better to do, that companies are buying up property just to feed their own growth.  Japan has the most successfully unregulated real estate market in the world. But ask Americans if they want to live in places shaped liked Tokyo. The answer will be no. So ultimately we’ll need to reduce demand. Birth rates are falling but will take a least a generation to play out.",ElectronGuru,2023-07-04T22:16:52,4
"It’s very easy actually. The solution is not to “build more homes” in most places. The solution is to decommodify homes. A simple piece of legislation that requires homes to be built for need and not for profit would fix it. We could even add restrictions on home ownership—one home, one person. This would restrict the corporate ownership of millions of homes.  The housing crisis is not a crisis of housing, it’s a crisis of capitalism and the use of homes as investments to accumulate vast amounts of wealth for a few, not as places to live as a human right.",Colzach,2023-07-05T02:50:01,2
"It got a lot harder when the jrbuch crash morphed several million family homes into rentals. A lot of the repo's were in older neighborhoods that used to provide starter homes for young couples willing to apply a little DYI to acquire the only significant asset most Americans ever possess. When these houses became rentals, not only were they no longer available to middle class buyers, but maintenance also pretty much ceased and improvements came to a dead stop. Likewise the rents are considerably more than a mortgage would've been and produce no ""generational wealth"" further concentrating wealth at the top.",Olderscout77,2023-07-07T10:00:32,1
Maybe not easy but certainly counterintuitive. The return on investment to building huge houses is higher but folks really need multiple small houses to house many families and individuals in their own separate places. There are more lower income than folks who can afford or want to take care of the bigger houses too. So smaller units get occupied and sell faster and more frequently. Its the less of 10 sweaters for $100 each or ONE $10k sweater. Sure you only have to sell ONE $10K sweater but you are gonna get damn hungry waiting for a buyer to come along willing or able to pay that.,tuna_tofu,2023-07-07T17:53:57,1
"There is pretty much no problem that involves an entire society that is ""easy.""  It might be easy to *say* a solution but it's one of those [""how to draw an owl""](https://i.imgur.com/rCr9A.png) things where it sounds much, much simpler than it is.  For instance, ""build more housing.""  So first, that requires some examination of the things you need to build more housing.  Take a random, fictional city. It's got 500,000 people in it and they want to add 50,000 units of housing.  Can that city support the load that 50,000 units of housing is going to put on the infrastructure? A lot of cities are struggling to keep pace with the populations they have now in terms of things like roads, water, electricity, etc. Infrastructure can expand, sure, but that's not a cheap proposition.   Flint, MI's water system is estimated to cost [over $200 million](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/flint-water-crisis-lead-pipes-infrastructure-cost) to fix which is up there with the entire yearly budget of the city. And that's *just* to fix what's already there, that's not including the cost of expanding it to allow for more homes to be built.  That's a massive expense that someone has to take on and unfortunately that someone is the city government. Taxpayers do not like spending huge amounts of money on things they can't directly see the benefits from. Everybody vaguely understands why a solid water system is a good idea but that's not a concrete problem unless you're somewhere like Flint. How happy are you going to be to have a huge budget diversion for a decade or more to fix a system that, to you, seems to be working fine?  Setting that problem aside, housing is virtually all built by the private market. Their goal is profit, not to provide housing. If you're a developer, would you rather build a bunch of luxury condos you can make a huge profit off of or some cheaper apartment buildings that, while you'll make money, you won't make nearly as much?   Luxury and higher end housing technically increases the housing supply but it doesn't increase it where there's shortages and you generally cant ""out build"" the demand for such housing to the point where prices actively start to drop.   Because housing is an investment for a lot of people, it's hard to get the value to truly drop because the demand isn't based so much on *need* as it is a desire to make money. You can't satiate that demand and thus that demand doesn't drop.",HeloRising,2023-07-08T04:00:07,1
"In principle it's easy. Allow more homes to be built to the point that the price to sell or rent drops. In practice, not so easy. A lot of people have an interest in new buildings not being built near them. There will be some expensive upgrades to infrastructure required if cities take building more housing seriously. There's also an issue with the capacity of the construction industry. Workers qualified to do that are just about fully-employed now so in order to build more there either needs to be more of them through training or immigration or a substantial change in construction technology so that the same workers can build more.",pensivegargoyle,2023-07-12T11:43:55,1
"Believe it or not there was a time when housing was reasonably accessible and could be again. Before the 1980’s housing was much cheaper. My parents owned a large two-storey house in a decent neighborhood they bought for $12,000 and paid off for $88 a month. My aunt had a smaller house she bought for $5,000.  At that time housing was considered a necessity, like food and water. We all pay affordable prices for food and water because if we would be charged competitive market rates many of us would die of starvation and thirst the same way many of us are now living homeless. Necessities are not considered part of the Capital market economy and the government regulates how much can be charged for food and water.   But in the ‘80’s housing was removed from the necessities list and made part of the competitive market economy. People could sell their homes for as much as they could get for them no matter how far out of the reach they became for many buyers. Real estate became not a roof over your head, but an investment. So houses like my parents’ shot up to $100,000 (not when I was living in it), then $400,000. Now you can buy a very ordinary house, in a very ordinary neighborhood in Toronto for $1.5 million —- with practically no yard, no pool and not even a walk-in closet.   Make real estate a necessity again and the prices will drop accordingly.",MangoMalarkey,2023-11-02T19:20:35,1
"I don't think space is an issue in America. Doesn't matter where you live you can look around and find empty land anywhere, someone might own that land but doing nothing with it.      If we break apart the good parts of the Japanese real estate system, most americans will think we have that already when we don't. Like being able to make money in your residential area. If you ask someone why can't America have vending machines like Japan, the goto answer would be crime not zones.",kin4212,2023-07-09T06:48:44,1
">This dramatically reduced how many homes and how many people can live on a given acre of land. So the potential for new home is less.  I agree with most of what you said except this part. In any development, the roads take up a bit more land, but they're taking up land that would likely be used for pedestrian walkways and greenspaces within a given neighborhood.  I think the NIMBY attitudes and poor zoning rules, have more of an effect on *how much* housing can go into any given location.",HTC864,2023-07-05T00:53:41,1
"I partially disagree. I think there is tremendous need and value for renting homes/apartments, so landlording must exist in some capacity. BUT, the larger problem is, as you say, the commodification. I think a valid fix would be to tax passive income(of all sorts, not just rent collection), at a progressive scale that has scales differently than labor income.      For example, any profit gained passively should be taxed at 10% for say, 30k and below and then 20% for 30-75k, 30% for 75k to 150k, 50% for 150k to 250k, 75% for 250k to 500k and 90% for everything over that.  This would create a disincentive to hoard real estate, as the diminishing returns would make it less worthwhile. This makes it so a person has an interest in renting out affordable housing, but not min-maxing their real estate empire.      I'd also switch from property taxation to land value taxation, as that means that the land is actually used productively, but that's a whole other(related) topic.",scubafork,2023-07-05T15:06:25,3
The only productive thing to solve this is people just talk about it without authoritative influence. The hardest task in the world these days. A prerequisite is to understand what courage means.,kin4212,2023-11-02T20:09:43,1
"It's not the roads that take up all the space. It's the parking. If you replaced single passenger cars with busses, you'd still need a similar space worth of roads, but parking lots take up somewhere around 20% of the land in urban America.   Not that I think this will happen, but imagine for a moment that we snapped our fingers and replaced single passenger cars with a self driving taxi service with a centralized lot for all the vehicles somewhere out of the way. You still need a loading/unloading area in front of every business, but all of the employee parking or the massive mall style parking lots could be replaced by new construction. It would DRASTICALLY density the downtown and commercial districts, allowing for rezoning of previously required businesses into residential areas.",brainpower4,2023-07-05T08:11:11,2
"I was thinking of residential or suburban areas, as they were talking about not having enough room for more housing. I agree that the opportunity of self-driving taxis is being able to replace vehicles that sit idle 90% of the time, therefore requiring storage.   But even if we do that I don't see a lot of the that land in city cores naturally turning into housing. We've gotten ourselves into an addiction that very hard to get away from.   One of the reason mayors of large cities are pushing away from WFH, is because it's a quick fix to fill empty buildings, prop up property values, and raise tax revenues. They could've made fundamental changes that would incentivize companies to leave their office spaces, and revamp those areas into residential. But those are long term plans that are inconvenient.",HTC864,2023-07-05T08:22:46,1
"That's the thing about parking lots: they are literally wasted space. My dad works in commercial real-estate, and you would not BELIEVE how upset land developers get with the idea that almost half of their multimillion dollar investment being taken up by car daycare space.   Work from home drastically reduces land values because you no longer need dedicated work spaces in city centers and there is less traffic driving commerce.   Getting rid of parking lots drastically increases land value because you can nearly double the usable space/lot. It would be a huge transition, and you'd end up with huge suburban wastelands as businesses that are no longer forced to exist on stroads and mini-malls densify to go to where the actual traffic is, but all of that newly unused land can be redeveloped to new housing.",brainpower4,2023-07-05T08:37:17,2
