"No shit, chucklefucks. They all willingly participated in the destruction of the foundations of the economy under the idiotic notion that they would somehow be immune to *the destruction of the foundations of the economy*.  They could have chosen to continue raising all boats, continue the unprecedented economic recovery and growth they had the last 4 years, but these sociopaths decided that success was not *really* success unless they are the *only* ones succeeding, and they *actually* thought they could tank the economy and somehow not be impacted by it.   As if the economic reality they have created gives a single flying fuck about their brown-nosing. You can't bribe reality. You cannot obsequiate to reality.  These losses are only a fraction of what they deserve. This kind of concentration of wealth should not exist, because clearly they are too goddamn fucking stupid to handle it.",HerbaciousTea,2025-05-01T12:34:45,8
