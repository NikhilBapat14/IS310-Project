"If only we invested in nuclear power. It’s the safest and cleanest option we have for energy production in terms of power produced.   Too bad a bunch of Russian oligarchs blew up Ukraine because they were more concerned about producing nuclear weapons.   Sadly, it seems like we have to wait for efficient fusion reactors because of the lied peddled by anti nuclear propaganda.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-25T18:17:10,21

"Talk to the Time magazine editors who talked with great certainty in the 1970’s of the coming ice age, delusional! When that lie didn’t work, they changed it to “climate change”, all nonsense!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T05:41:30,1
"I wish I was quick witted enough to make a sarcastic comment about this. Unfortunately, I’m incapable. So, I’m just not gonna be a douche like that, and instead will be straight forward.  I find it hilarious that we have studies on this that go back centuries, showing that the democrats are wrong on the issue of climate change. Every time we point out that they’re wrong, they call us science deniers. And yet, we have concrete proof, not just theory, that the opposite of what they’re saying is true, making THEM the REAL science deniers.  These people are total asshats.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-25T17:08:59,-10

"To think we as humans somehow have influence and effect over a natural mechanism of Earth that has occurred since creation, and can somehow “stop” or reduce it, is arrogance, foolishness, and sheer ignorance beyond belief.",ITrCool,2025-04-25T20:35:37,-10
