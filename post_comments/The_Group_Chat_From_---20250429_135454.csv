"""It’s less dark matter than brain-dead matter.""  The only sentence I need to read from this story to get the gist.  Wealthy Silicon Valley weirdo technocrats have a group chat congratulating themselves about being a group of bored, racist, homophobic imbeciles in the name of completely burning the Constitution and the American people to get a dopamine rush.  Also, probably to make sure their penis is still operational because they can't get off otherwise along with their mouth breathing MAGA degenerates.

">…Smith has unearthed of the chat’s exchanges and thematic preoccupations bespeaks a much more mundane and inert boardroom-grade discourse of like-minded self-congratulation, with a heavy dose of culture-war persecution fantasies to keep things feeling edgy. It’s less dark matter than brain-dead matter.  They ooze self-importance.",R_Lennox,2025-04-29T21:14:37,3

"The whole thing is just a fucking joke.  It’s a bunch of dudes living in the bluest area in the bluest state in the country, usually with Asian or Latin wives, fucking hyping up the politics of areas that would never step foot in for 1 second in their entire lives.  Until I hear that Meta is moving their headquarters to Clinton, Louisiana, I’m not gonna take this seriously.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-29T14:20:23,78

"Tech used to be cooler. That free software movement shit that got us stuff like wikipedia. Old school hacker culture in a similar vein. Of course, there was always business crap muddying things, but a lot of older techy culture was genuinely *cool*. I mean imperfect the way the past was certainly, but they had some good ideas.  These corpo fucks ruined it though. For them, tech is a means of control. These sort of people would invent the telephone just so they could listen to your calls.  I wouldn't blame tech itself though. The world those old heads envisioned is still possible. But the capitalism of it all has poisoned it, and attracted the worst kinds of people to tech.",noitsnotmykink,2025-04-29T17:09:14,14

"I'd say it's a split between corpos, organized crime, and the Eternal September effect.  A lot of the reason that things like free software and running your own website got to be too much trouble is because of security. Software has to update all the damn time. Software devs have to compete a lot less on quality than they would if sticking with older software was a viable option. The trouble is, there's a tremendous amount of money to be made hacking anything that's on the internet and not up to date.  Free software got started back when the internet was mostly people who wanted to work with computers back when it wasn't easy, that is, mainly students and IT workers. In the early 90s anyone who bought a PC for gaming or bringing their desk job home started to get online, and the culture changed, but the old ways still existed. Now everyone's had the internet in their pocket for over a decade. Tech is awful because half the users are awful. Sure, social media didn't have to take the easy way to maximize engagement, but the users wanted angertainment to begin with.",InterdictorCompellor,2025-04-29T17:41:06,6
