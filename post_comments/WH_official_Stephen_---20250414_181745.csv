"""In 2019, he was ordered deported. He has a final removal order from the United States. These are things that no one disputes. Where is he from? El Salvador. Where is he a resident and citizen of? El Salvador. Is he here illegally? Yes. Does he have a deportation order? Yes.   “Here’s the thing: if you are a member of a foreign terrorist organization, you cannot have a withholding order,” he said. “Since he’s in MS-13, there is no withholding order. Furthermore, that gang he is accused of being persecuted by doesn’t exist anymore in El Salvador. The 18th Street gang is gone.”   The end.  Bye bye illegal immigrant gang member. So sad.",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-14T18:19:33,168
I really want to see the media attempt a smear campaign against Bukele. Try to make the 95% approval rating president who reduced the crime rate of El Salvador to the lowest in Latin America look bad.   Bring his deeds to light and expose to the entire world that you can just ignore these cartel-loving NGOs and solve crime by-- get this-- putting the fucking criminals in jail.    Maybe we don't need to let people part of a gang famous for carving out hearts back onto the streets. That seems like a good idea.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-14T18:25:28,44
"It doesn't matter at this point. If El Salvador wont deport him, nothing Trump can say or do will change that. He is gone.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T18:56:03,14
Reddit libs actually advocating to import more MS-13 gangsters lmao.   Maybe they should volunteer to house a bunch of MS-13 in their homes with their wives and daughters,T0XxXiXiTy,2025-04-14T18:55:17,-5

This.  All points so called Conservatives in this sub getting massively upvoted ignore.,Merax75,2025-04-14T18:40:36,60
"He does seem like he is very likely flirting with being a dictator, if I’m being honest. Can’t argue with the results he’s had, but his methods make me a bit uncomfortable. Not my country though, so whatever.",xxxiareo,2025-04-14T20:19:49,132
Dems in the “main” subreddits saying we should depose a foreign president once they are back in power lol,Disastrous-Power-699,2025-04-14T18:56:53,6
"Then stop paying them. If these are all folks that El Salvador wants, why are we paying them? If we made a formal request, and withheld payment for him, yet they still said no, I’d be a much happier camper. At least we put forth minimal effort.  As it is, this doesn’t saves us money, doesn’t follow the rule of law (ie ignoring the courts), and isn’t morally correct, at least from my christian view point (the guy is probably going to die without due process) I don’t see how this is a conservative move. It’s more a f*ck the libs kind of move.",iowaisflat,2025-04-15T16:31:34,8
We miss him.  Says no American with common sense.,Flare4roach,2025-04-14T20:01:35,-13
One of the comments in the other thread spouting the leftist talking points is +3000.  Just unreal. ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-14T18:42:16,73
That is because they already do an anti-brigade for their own people.  Like I keep saying we need to upvote everything Conservatives... REAL Conservatives post even if we don't comment or are not interested in the article or post.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T18:57:38,14
It’s really embarrassing that they have to astroturf as a last resort lol Obi wan Jedi mind tricks is their Hail Mary,slap-a-taptap,2025-04-14T22:24:37,-5
"Users cannot sort this out, its a mod thing. Reddit has probably forced the sub to accept leftist mods who allow leftists to have flairs",Delicious_Physics_74,2025-04-14T20:19:14,-7
Does that mean you can't upvote another Conservative?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T05:50:01,3
"100% this. Why are leftist talking points sitting with thousands of upvotes in these threads without being removed and why do the users who regularly post them still have flairs? The mods could end this, drive the left away, and bring conservatives back here but they don't. This place is controlled opposition it's the only reason the left that runs reddit has allowed it to exist to propagandize against conservatives, while they banned every other conservative sub.",day25,2025-04-14T23:09:47,-3

The whole site is a CIA psyop,Delicious_Physics_74,2025-04-14T23:16:48,-7
"Doesn't mean we shouldn't upvote other conservatives.  Hell if enough people felt that we couldn't out vote the liberals last November and didn't even try, we would have lost the election.  Trump won, get optimistic... seriously... so many people sounds like Glum from the Gulliver's Travels cartoon on the Banana Splits... We're all doomed....",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T15:42:31,0
