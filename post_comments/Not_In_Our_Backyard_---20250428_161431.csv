Sounds like Trump would rather send people to South America anyway.   I hate this. We already have one of the highest incarceration rates in the free world. The last thing we need is more of that.,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-28T16:25:44,8
"Wow, NIMBYs but for shitty things. That’s like even worse. At least housing is good. They’re like “while I support concentration camps in general I just don’t want one in my backyard because the only thing bigger than my hate is my selfishness”.  It’s just…chefs kiss.

"From our report:  Leavenworth, Kansas, [is a prison town](https://www.travelks.com/kansas-magazine/articles/post/the-lore-of-kansas-first-city-leavenworth/). ... But there’s one prison [local officials aren’t interested in](https://kansasreflector.com/2025/04/06/this-kansas-town-knows-prisons-it-doesnt-want-a-for-profit-company-opening-a-hell-hole-for-ice/): An immigration detention center that private prison operator CoreCivic has proposed. The controversy over the proposal is indicative of a tension playing out across the country as the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda bumps up against [practical limitations in detention bed space](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-immigration-detention-maxed-out-47600-detainees-ice-official-says-2025-03-12/).  ... The nation’s detention facilities were maxed out last month, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and The Washington Post reported that in some overcrowded facilities, [detainees are being forced to sleep on the floor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/18/immigrant-detention-overcrowding-trump-crackdown/). At the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, The Associated Press reports that staff fear an “uprising” as the population [has soared to nearly three times capacity](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-miami-deportation-detention-ice-67a6c798b56ea4b42ee06afcc8c22428).  Despite the crunch, it’s not clear that communities around the country are clamoring to host facilities. In Lincoln County, Wyoming — where Trump [won by nearly 70 points in 2024](https://www.kemmerergazette.com/stories/2024-general-election-unofficial-results,49599) — the local community has also rebuffed efforts to construct an immigration detention center in the area, at least in part due to concerns that [the federal government has become a less reliable contract partner](https://wyofile.com/kemmerer-balks-at-immigration-jail-as-private-prisons-eye-southwest-wyoming-again/) under Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE efforts. “We can’t do it, and we don’t want it,” a local politician bluntly told WyoFile.  Efforts to reopen shuttered facilities around the country are well underway in [Michigan](https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/baldwin-prison-ice-detention-center/69-9bd44e29-e6d5-4d69-b73d-367e131a2019), [New Jersey](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/newark-new-jersey-migrant-detention-facility-reopening/), [Texas](https://apnews.com/article/immigrant-detention-facility-families-texas-dilley-2cd794bdd0b81dca98c8353348fc149b) [and elsewhere](https://stateline.org/2025/04/11/for-profit-immigration-detention-expands-as-trump-accelerates-his-deportation-plans/), often despite the concerns of local politicians and activists.

"NGL I don’t know why they don’t just put these mega prisons in the middle of the desert or something. Doesn’t the military own most of that land anyway? Put it 200 miles from the nearest town in New Mexico or Nevada. What’s even the point of sending them to El Salvador? We have some of the most desolate and isolated land in the world. You can put razor wire fences around tents in the middle of the Sonoran desert, staff it with military, and probably get the same result.",cmiller4642,2025-04-28T16:50:37,-5
The detention center in NJ (1000 capacity) that was just reopened is a 20 minute drive to an international airport.  They will be able to kidnap and remove people from this country much faster with these reopened.,totallydawgsome,2025-04-28T16:54:42,5

"1. That’s absolutely horrible, it’s a fuckin concentration camp. What the fuck why are you speculating on fucking fascism?  2. It’s because if it was on US soil then it would be harder to defy the courts. They’re monstrously stupid but this dumb fuck administration figured out the foreign prison loophole (or they’re attempting to subvert democracy with it). They will hang for this, but for now they are making an effort ",Juicybusey20,2025-04-28T17:25:01,7
