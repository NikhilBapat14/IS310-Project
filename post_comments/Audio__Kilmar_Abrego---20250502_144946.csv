"Now we like due process and the constitution? What about COVID? Where was the due process then? In California (Los Angeles specifically) they were able to suspend the constitution, citing emergency orders and safety. They were able to suspend the sixth amendment for anyone who had been arrested and charged of a crime. You could be sitting in jail indefinitely until the emergency mandate (which is based on a virus that had less than 1% fatality rate) until they deemed it ""safe."" Also, if you did finally go to trial, you didn't have the right to face your accuser due to the fact that it was deemed unsafe to be in the same room; again, going against the constitution.  Multiple people were arrested, simply for going outside (for example, the lone paddle border) and many businesses had to be shut down. Also, anyone who was suspected of having a gathering of multiple people in the residence could (and did) have their power cut out again leaving out any due process all while our governor was dining indoors at the French Laundry. Children were not allowed to go to school due to a virus that affected children even less than adults and as a result we have one of the most anxious generation of children with no social skills. We have multiple businesses, small businesses and restaurants shut down that no longer exist due to the fact that they enacted these emergency mandates. We also had people being fired from their jobs and the military due to refusing to take a medical treatment that was mandated on people which once again we found out wasn‚Äôt as effective as they initially said.

No one violated Americans due process rights during Covid. That's why no one is upset about it. Show me a single person who was subjected to prison or jail without due process. One. A single person.

"> over an illegal alien   Not that it will matter to you, but he was here legally, with a valid work permit.   > and people ignoring the previous administration's actions that violated American's due process rights.  You've yet to come up with an actual, specific example of *due process* being denied to anyone. Trial delays aren't denying due process; they happen for all sorts of reasons. Court hearings that are by camera rather than in-person don't deny anyone due process.  Companies and hospitals having rules about vaccination isn't denying anyone due process. Etc.  But even if you could come up with an actual example, that would just mean that Trump isn't the only one who *did something unconstitutional that anyone who doesn't want to live in a dictatorship should find absolutely unacceptable.*",KingKrasnov,2025-05-02T16:11:34,1
