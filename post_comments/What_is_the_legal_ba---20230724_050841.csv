"The bottle neck in our immigration policy is the court system.  Immigration courts are not Article 3 courts, they are Article 2 courts.  Funded and run solely by the Executive branch and not subject to Federal court or Supreme court review except in extreme cases.  Per our immigration policy anyone who presents at the border with a valid asylum claim is given a court date to make their case.  The backlog of these cases topped 1 million under President Trump in  2019 and is on track to double that number today.    Average time for a case to clear is 4 to 5 years and many go over a decade.  Most asylum seekers are released pending their court date.  Some have either family or friends in the States they can go live with, others rely on local support networks and working under-the-table to get by while waiting to see if they will be deported or not.  The Federal Government generally does not ship them around from state to state after the initial intake process is complete.  Border states like Texas, which have been dealing with immigration issues for years and feel the rest of the Nation doesn't take them seriously because of the big hats, have recently decided it is a funny gag to talk a bunch of people with nowhere to go into a plane or a bus and drop them off on someone else's doorstep.  But that doesn't really have anything to do with our immigration laws.",waremi,2023-07-25T19:15:38,11
I think you need to clarify just what you’re asking. Are you asking how immigrants are allowed in to the country? Are you asking under what laws they’re allowed in? Are you asking about quotas and visa lotteries?,Polarion,2023-07-24T21:56:44,4
">so many migrants are being admitted and transported from state to state in the USA  What make you think that? Is is more than usual? Or is is less than usual? Who has told you that there are so many?  My point is, you have some unexamined premises in your question. You are going to need to sort some of them out before you can get a good answer.",nickcan,2023-07-24T23:04:49,6
People seeking asylum for humanitarian purposes have a right to remain while their case is investigated and their due process is undertaken. Many are seeking refuge especially for children from gang rule. and corrupt gov. Local and national. Brutalized and even murdered by the anarchy they journey to hope and a chance for a better life.They will come and work jobs nobody wants.  The reality the majority are eventually sent back. The ones who hide are eventually found and then deported or imprisoned. Those who are crying but climate denying? Wait as it gets more and more impossible to live at the equator. All of them will head this way! All of them! The numbers will be devestating.,IndependentNo4370,2023-07-26T03:34:28,2
"All, I read this article which pretty much educated me on the topic.  I highly recommend it.     https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/bidens-dilemma-at-the-border",bleddybear,2023-07-31T07:37:42,1
My question was rhetorical. If the entire populations of all of South America started migrating because the conditions so close to the equator were no longer viable those climate deniers and immigration dumpster fire setters would really have an invasion at the Southern Border they never dreamed possible. Yes we do have a lot of land Wyoming is among the least populated states for example. The amount of of people fleeing from certain death would be a devestating crisis. Food water resourced housing and living arrangements amongst basic necessities. We would eventually find solutions but the initial impact would be unmet as a comprehensive plan can never be agreed upon it is the obstinance that has taken a severe toll on our trust in Democracy!,IndependentNo4370,2023-07-28T05:17:33,1
Well yes and I am just stating that whole countries migrating due to climate chsnge would be an incentive to start taking it seriously if I were on the right?,IndependentNo4370,2023-07-30T22:35:39,1
Immigration volume does not fluctuate much between R and D administrations.  This is a major issue with no easy solution. Would Jesus turn away people at the border. Our greed is the real problem but that’s what makes the USA great. CAPITALISM.,YnotROI0202,2023-08-10T17:26:17,1

"> have recently decided it is a funny gag to talk a bunch of people with nowhere to go into a plane or a bus and drop them off on someone else's doorstep.  It is not a gag. There are 50 America states, but only 4 Mexican border states, where most of the immigrants are crossing.  It is an effort to make the burden of immigration more equitable to all states.    Yes, there is prioritization by Texas to send immigrants to the [11 sanctuary states](https://www.fairus.org/issue/sanctuary-policies/do-you-live-1-11-sanctuary-states), which have high populations of Open-Borders Activists, who think the U.S. and Europe should house all comers from the southern hemisphere.  These activists have long been involved in coaching Central America immigrants to recite the *Death squads have targeted me and my family* narrative, so as to fabricate a basis to enter the U.S.",GullibleAntelope,2023-07-29T23:58:49,0
Agree and thanks… to be honest I was so uneducated on the topic I was basically throwing out a lifeline for inputs…. Since I posted the question I read the recent New Yorker article on the topic which has answered most if not all of my points of confusion…. That article is here.    https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/bidens-dilemma-at-the-border,bleddybear,2023-07-31T07:42:26,1
Devastating for whom? Have you ever driven across USA? We have tons of open land and can easily accommodate millions.,Equivalent_Nerve_870,2023-07-28T01:25:14,2
> Many are seeking refuge...(from) corrupt gov.  No shortage of those in the world.  500 million - 1 billion people would probably qualify for immigration on that basis.,GullibleAntelope,2023-07-30T00:06:43,1

"This is a pretty narrativized perspective which kinda ignores a lot of nuance and offers a pretty favourable view of Texas’s political games. Flying immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard was a political stunt to mess with democrats and embarrass people - it was illegal for the governor to do, and may have actually been kidnapping. The fact you think it’s okay to lie to potential refugees and use them as political pawns for stunts against your opponents is gross. They are people. Grow up.   Whether or not we think one should ease the burden of immigration on border states - that is not the way to go about doing it. Also your claim about “activists coaxing refugees” is tenuous at best and basically heresy/unproven conjecture. While there are many who do think we can “house all comers” as you say, republicans manufacture fear around these “migrant caravans” and make claims they are an invasion of drug dealers, poor non-workers, and criminals bent on taking away from our system. This isn’t a reasonable description of what happens south of the border at all, and if this at all reflects your view I encourage you look into other news sources. I also think you should be maybe more concerned with how we arbitrarily deny people entrance to this country for a whole host of reasons - including using COVID as a bullshit excuse to send people back/detain them (title 42 iirc). People are allowed to seek asylum. Stop trying to prevent them.",ITrulyWantToDie,2023-09-03T21:56:06,1
"I never specifically discussed Martha's Vineyard, only the broader relocation of immigrants to other states.  They are not entitled to demand residence in any particular state.  >it was illegal for the governor to do, and may have actually been kidnapping.

"“I never specifically discussed Martha’s Vineyard….”  An interlocutor is allowed to bring up a new topic as an example to support a point they’re trying to make. The fact that you didn’t mention it first is irrelevant.  “Go ahead and join the….”  Pointing out the slowness or inefficiency of bureaucracy in the judicial system is not addressing the legality. It’s a non sequitur that you cited in order to avoid addressing it. Addressing it, at the very least, would require delving into whether justice is meted out equally amongst the citizenry of the U.S.   “Buzz off.”  If you can’t accept that migrants are just people like you and deserve to be treated with dignity, you haven’t grown up yet.",Turbulent-Bee6921,2024-03-15T19:46:17,1
