"😂 That reminded me of the old saying ""you catch more flies with honey than vinegar"".   OR, positive  reinforcement works better than negative ones.

"Yes, of course. BUT, I can't stand giving this POS so much power:  * He uses his social media platform like a diary.. * Then the media sees it and publishes an article based on his craziness. * Then depending on the subject matter, the media then reports what others, in this case the UK, Hollywood, Netflix, Disney, etc., etc., etc feel about what he ""plans"" to do and how it will effect/hurt them.... * Then there is chaos and more chaos and more chaos. * Someone take away his phone or whatever he uses to post his craziness!! 🙄",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-05T14:58:41,4

"I’m sure there’s also some influence from their fascist ideologies and desire to regulate the perception of the US, and those playing in such productions.  But the wish-washy BS is likely to allow their criminal friend base to profit as they run the world into the ground.

"I think this is a big thing that needs to start being taken into account, or we are all going to collectively go insane before 2028.

Posting a photo of himself as the Pope only affects the left because Republicans are in on the joke.

"I agree and look at ALL of the uproar this issue, and the news articles covering it, has caused.

Keeps people engaged and the clicks rolling. This is something that directly affects all of us and will keep our attention for as long as they blast it in our faces. CNN will get a panel of six people together on a split screen tonight just to talk about this and ignore every other significant piece of news.
