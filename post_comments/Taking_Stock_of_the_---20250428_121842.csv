"He argues that the failure of Biden's president rests entirely on his decision to split the infrastructure bill from the other stuff he wanted to do, instead of doing it all at once with Sinema and Manchin.   That's... interesting, but how can this be argued without also mentioning why Biden may have chosen this route?
