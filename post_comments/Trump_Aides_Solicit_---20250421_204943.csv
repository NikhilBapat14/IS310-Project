"Trump is looking for white women to sacrifice their mind and body to make factory workers.   ""Much of the movement is built around promoting a very specific idea of what constitutes a family ‚Äî one that includes marriage between a man and a woman, and leaves out many families that don‚Äôt conform to traditional gender roles or family structures. In contrast to the intense emphasis on cost cutting so far during Mr. Trump‚Äôs second term, this focus on families could result in spending more money to back a new set of priorities.""   ‚ÄúThe President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAs a mother myself, I am proud to work for a president who is taking significant action to leave a better country for the next generation.‚Äù   Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance and Mr. Musk have cultivated the movement by publicly highlighting issues related to family policy and ‚Äúpronatalism‚Äù ‚Äî both in the lead up to the election, and since Mr. Trump took office. Speaking to a crowd in January at the March for Life, an anti-abortion rally, Mr. Vance said he wanted ‚Äúmore babies in the United States of America‚Äù and more ‚Äúbeautiful young men and women‚Äù to raise them.

"It's all about having enough poor unemployed to fill the factories with cheap labor. Because when the labor force shrinks, people can demand hire wages.  Just look at countries with high populations with heavy unemployment. They pay them just enough to keep breathing.   Having a smaller family gives you more economic control. Another reason they want to prevent abortion and birth control. Though they join forces with and feed the frenzy of the ultra religious.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-22T00:40:40,2

"This is INSANE. We live in a high COL area. We have 2 children in public elementary school, but a 3rd would have meant constant financial worry coupled with a significant step down in our lifestyle quality (one activity each for kids, putting off home repairs and praying that the roof didn't leak, no travel/leisure, and we would have to put significant time and energy into seeking out free cycle items like baseball pants and winter coats...we love hand-me-downs from friends and family, we just don't have to scour facebook for them)   Mega wealthy people are completely out of touch with what it takes to support children. I understand that we have it better than most people, but I would be chronically ill from worry if we had the expense of another child. $5000 doesn't put a dent in the $100k or so it takes for childcare prior to public kindergarten or lost income from maternity leave.",Zealousideal_Low7964,2025-04-26T09:49:35,2

"The birth rate isn't going up until some major changes that are anathema to capitalism and business happen.  Right now people are working 2-3 jobs and just scraping by.  There is no time for a child.  No money.  no Bandwidth.  In order to make it easier to have kids lots of things would have to happen that the Ogliarchy would never approve of.  1. More time.  That means less work by the working class in service to the ruling class.  Giving time off to parents for kids' needs isn't going to happen.    2, More money.  Paying someone enough so that like most grandparents, they can work one job to support a family.    3.  Healthcare and education.  Given the state of both in the country as an adult I worry for the immediate future let alone the future 20 years from now.    All of this is money and the ruling class want the workers, they just don't want to pay enough to enable people to have that sort of lifestyle that would allow for kids.",No-Cut-6501,2025-04-22T09:51:02,1
