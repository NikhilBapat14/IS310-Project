Collins is asking the wrong person. She needs to tell Schumer's imaginary friends about it. He will listen to them.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-30T15:22:18,17
"How the hell can you use Trump’s horrible polling numbers as a sign the majority of Americans don’t support him or his agenda, but then aren’t concerned with your own numbers that are arguably worse? Can you possibly do a better job of proving the exact reason why everyone wants you to hang it up?",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-04-30T16:04:17,12
I really hope AOC primaries him. He'll be toast.,DarthHiccups,2025-04-30T17:47:12,8

Chuck is definitely writing a strongly worded letter to address this situation.,gabber2694,2025-04-30T17:03:30,5

"Kaitlan Collins no longer gets my respect after she let Trump spew unchecked lies during that cnn townhall shotshow that never should have existed. She just seems like a doormat now. Probably not a fair assessment but, it persists.",benzoseeker,2025-04-30T17:23:45,8
Democrats hate other dems more than Trump apparently. Schumer’s time has passed.,oroechimaru,2025-04-30T19:36:36,2
How is it that high? Family and friends?,fastcatdog,2025-04-30T21:36:22,2
"He's almost delusional as trump. He's going to ""show the difference"" until we lose our democracy instead of fighting for America.",ObscurePaprika,2025-05-01T05:48:17,2
Kaitlin: Are you concerned that no on in America or your own party likes you based on this poll and Democrats want stronger leadership?  Schumer: No. Why would I be? We will keep doing what we've always done and will win in the end.,tinglep,2025-05-01T12:36:47,2

Doubt it. He's already had 17%/18% approval ratings in the past and still somehow ends up with the seat.,The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-30T15:49:05,2

"Amazingly he has a higher approval than Senate majority leader thune.  And of all congressional leaders Mike Johnson is the highest and is not even at 25%. Americans hate their government but they won't vote in general elections, and they never vote in primaries. It's literal insanity.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T14:59:41,72
The only person who would be happy with approval in the teens is Matt Gaetz,Peroovian,2025-04-30T18:57:41,5

"I wonder if the imaginary couple he turns too are in the 17% or if they also disapprove of the job he is doing, because if that was the case, it must make for some really depressing inner monologues.",Routine-Reaction-592,2025-04-30T15:54:21,1

"I’m American, I vote in every election that has any pertinence to me (I didn’t vote in a Republican only primary) and the fact that others don’t vote drives me crazy.  They complain that nothing changes, nothing gets better, but they won’t be politically active, so, they get what they “pay” for.",Iamsoconfusednow,2025-04-30T15:10:55,28
"Voter apathy is real, but somewhat of a symptom of congressional ineffectiveness.   Congress has gradually done less and less governing over the years. The last Congress was historically unproductive. This pushes responsibilities that belong to Congress, to the president. The president then governs via executive orders. There is a reason no one thinks about their congressional reps and instead defaults to the president.",time_drifter,2025-04-30T16:56:01,8
"Most primaries are closed, meaning you have to be registered to the specific party to vote in their primaries.",JewsieJay,2025-04-30T16:20:21,4
"Americans also seem to love our own reps in these polls but we hate everybody else's.  In the same way, I've noticed that we blame traffic problems on out of state drivers.  Maybe it's time crowd source draft legislation that actually addresses specific issues like we were the heritage foundation.  Sick of sitting on my hands.",bm1949,2025-04-30T17:40:44,3
"Meh. Party leaders in legislatures always have shit awful approval ratings because they exist to give legislators an excuse as to why they can't achieve anything. They tank.  Importantly, these are approval ratings from the nation, not their constituency.",Jolly-Star-9897,2025-05-01T07:25:15,1
