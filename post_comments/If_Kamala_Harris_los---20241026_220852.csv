"virtually none. VP pick has an extremely negligible impact on driving voters in their state, maybe 1% at most.  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/election-2016-vice-president-selection-matters-less-than-you-think-213805/  https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5049718/vice-presidential-picks-how-much-do-they-matter  https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=pol_fac_pub  https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/does-the-vice-presidential-pick-matter-to-the-election/  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-overrated-vice-presidential-home-state-effect/  I dont know where your conclusion of walz being ""not the guy"" comes from but it doesnt match with the majority consensus opinion. He's been well received and if anything, the campaign spent a period of time under-utilizing him.  Israel and Gaza and Palestine voters who wont vote for Kamala are either betraying their stated cause in favor of helping perpetuate the genocide under trump, and likely represent an EXTREMELY small fraction of voters. The majority of voters barely know anything about what is happening, let alone have a solidified formed opinion on the complicated historical situation etc. Voters are much more likely and more viscerally to care about what will actually affect their material conditions of living on a daily basis in the US. What happens in Gaza realistically will never affect them in any clearly identifiable way.",Riokaii,2024-10-27T15:20:02,15
"She can lose PA and still win the election - IF she wins NV and either NC or GA. If she loses PA,NC and GA she’s cooked, unless FL or TX somehow flip blue.",Sanfords_Son,2024-10-27T15:43:11,3

"Her VP pick is the least of her problems. If as a future leader of the free world you arent able to talk with Joe Rogan for 3 hours, if you have difficulty answering a single question with a clear and simple answer, if you come off as inauthentic, your VP choice really isnt gonna make a difference.  He is a goof, and yes Shapiro would have been a much better choice. He can speak and is better as coming across as a moderate.   Look at the comments section from her two big interviews with Charlemange and club Shay Shay... 3 or 4 dislikes to every like 3 million views combined and both comment section are full of black men and women that despise her.  JD vance has 13 million views on one podcast and overwhelmingly positive comments and likes to dislikes... Trump has 40 million views, 2 million likes and 45k dislikes.  The better question to ask is why wasnt Shapiro the Presidential pick? If they wanted a woman they should have kept Tulsi Gabbard around.  The democrats just keep overplaying their hand as far as woke $hit and stepping on their dicks.  They need a moderate democrat that inspires respect on the world stage... dont tell me that Kamala is the one.... nobody can lie to themselves that bad.",danbrooks3k,2024-11-04T01:53:04,1
"Yea, Harris should have picked Shapiro. Walz was an anchor on her campaign. Just proved to everyone how liberal Harris really is…",LopatoG,2024-11-06T07:36:12,1

"Welll, I guess the answer is no........lost by multiple states, Shapiro wouldnt have made a difference anyways.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-11-06T14:14:04,1
"Disagree.  Shapiro has a 57% approval rating in Pennsylvania.  Him as the VP would have helped deliver the state to Harris.  Of course he is a pro Israel warhawk, so you risk losing progressives with him.  Walz was supposed to help with that, but Kamala supporting the Biden position and not deviating in the slightest is hurting with progressives anyway.  It wouldn't have been hard to put out some PC statement about supporting Israel, but also having it be conditional on Israel cleaning up their human rights problems.",[deleted],2024-10-29T18:33:49,1
"This is literally an election where 1 percent will make or break Trump and Harris.  ""friendly"" reactions to the results of VP debate.  Walz........made JD Vance look good......which should never happen, and that is not a good thing.  And yes, it is important.  In traditional elections, consolidating a state with a VP candidate that can bolster a ""critical node"" state is extremely important, and has proven to be extremely important historically.  VP has never.......ever been a ""national"" pick.  It has historically been to pick up one crucial state that you are not sure is ""in the bag"".  Anyone who thinks Pennsylvania is ""in the bag"" right now is straight up high.  Israel/Gaza voters COULD decide the election (frankly, so could Ukraine voters in Pennsylvania, but I digress).  It matters.  I could give just as many linked articles indicating the importance of Israel/Palestinian ""one issue"" voters without 2 minutes of my time......  And this is the sort of ""blindsightedness"" that loses elections 2016 style.  This is teasing a repeat, make no mistake.  I agree that voters dont know anything, and generally are not overly informed, and thats what makes this even MORE important, because they vote for what they know.........and in Pennsylvania........what they know and that familiarity could have proven to be crucial.  Finally, the last link has validated that ""the gain in vice presidential candidate has been more important  in recent years (four points in recent years as opposed to two)"".  With THAT margin of error, yeah, that will comfortably make a difference.  Third link provided hardly any substance at all.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-10-27T16:27:17,-2
Your right - it’s not about Waltz - it’s about Harris’s record of effecting people’s material conditions on a daily basis which will caused her election downfall  - VP pick 1% or less on anyone she picked.,Psychological-Ball77,2024-10-29T04:49:49,0
Then why we gonna support them or talk about it if it doesn't affect anyone ,[deleted],2024-10-30T18:00:58,0
"Thats literally my mindset.  I assume she is losing NC and GA given current polling.  She NEEDS pennsylvania.  Its not an option at all.  Accepting Trump wins the states he is expected to win, and Kamala winning the states she expects to win.........this all comes down to Pennsylvania.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-10-27T16:21:37,3

"Yup, that too.  I think a moderate is exactly what Kamala needed honestly.  Beyond the obvious NEED PENNSYLVANIA thing.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-11-04T09:57:28,1
"Exactly.  Anything beyond Shapiro given the circumstances was a luxury pick trying to cater to a demographic (in this case middle east/palestine/islam supporters).  In American politics, you cater to a STATE.  You effing alllllllllways cater to a state.  This has been basic politics since drawing up the constitution.  She has no one to blame but herself for not taking someone who didnt tow a perfectly progressive line here.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-11-04T09:54:28,1
"> It has historically been to pick up one crucial state that you are not sure is ""in the bag"".  And the articles I linked all look at whether this actually works in practice, and it doesnt.",Riokaii,2024-10-27T18:32:49,2
"Well, if you assume the candidate that’s ahead in the polls in each state today will win that state, then she’s already lost since Trump is currently ahead in PA as well. But the polls in all three of those states are within the margin of error, so they could all still go either way.",Sanfords_Son,2024-10-27T17:35:35,1
"As someone who has lived through the 2000 election, no amount of articles will change the ""yes, it makes a difference"" reality of the matter.  I still have PTSD from that election.",Practical-Memory6386,2024-10-27T18:39:29,0
"Day after Day I continue to prepare myself for a Trump win. I just don't think he is going to lose. I could just be Debby downer but I honestly don't think so. People, for some reason, like his rhetoric",[deleted],2024-10-27T21:23:19,2
"Perfectly fair........""margin of error"" has made me a believer since 2016.  I will always remember MSNBC's projection that showed 99 scenarios where Hillary won, and one little corner on the far right in red that showed a Trump win.  My belief in polling has been completely shook since that election.  Its not over til its over.  That said, I am completely assuming hindsight in a scenario where Trump wins here.......and it all came down to a Pennsylvania loss.  Is Kamala just burnt at the torch for this mistake?",Practical-Memory6386,2024-10-27T18:41:07,1
"but the VP pick had nothing to do with the 2000 election? That was due to the supreme court (incorrectly) deciding the president improperly and unconstitutionally.   Research has shown that Gore won tens of thousands of discarded votes in Florida from voters who both bubbled his name and wrote in his name, unambiguously indicating their desired vote.",Riokaii,2024-10-27T18:41:20,3
