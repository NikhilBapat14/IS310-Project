"Oof.  Even if they panic and try to rescind the tariffs tomorrow, it will take 6 months+ before things normalize.  That’s assume immediate action AND trading partners willing to just let things go. Don’t imagine that happening at all.  This is really dark.",5minArgument,2025-04-29T11:44:41,9

Until it finallly hits them. They don’t get it. This will come for and hurt all of them and they won’t care so long as they have an edge of the people they hate. All we’re trying to do is prevent it from happening even to them let alone ourselves.,2much41post,2025-04-29T11:17:50,2

"Which is weird because they are a super Republican company.  With Trump reporting that the economy is booming like never before in history, shouldn’t they be hiring and not doing layoffs?",Electric_Conga,2025-04-29T11:28:48,8

"""They predict the future..."" Both the President and CEO voted for Trump. They are terrible at predicting the future. Just saying they are humans with motives.",williamgman,2025-04-29T12:28:42,2
"Yes, you are correct about this. Also, UPS is a public company that is beholden to Shareholders. It's necessary for UPS to support Shareholders or their business will fail. It's the reality we live in, whether we like it or not.",RealisticForYou,2025-04-29T13:03:07,1
UPS says that they are seeing a big reduction in Amazon orders and is the reason for the job cuts. Consumers appear to be holding back on spending.,RealisticForYou,2025-04-29T11:26:58,4
