"What am I even paying taxes for? We get no social programs, no new infrastructure, no improvements to current infrastructure. It's literally all going to rich people or killing people.",chpbnvic,2025-05-02T13:23:20,20

"Well cuts to everything but defense. Here's a related fun fact: The United States spends more on defense than the next 9 countries combined.  Plenty of money for war, but ""sorry I can't spare any change"" for the poor.",Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-05-02T13:12:42,13
They are trying to codify the cuts that Elon Musk put in place. They are trying to make legal what is currently illegal.,StrDstChsr34,2025-05-02T14:08:19,3
"Deep red states are pretty much depending on government spending. The first hit they got was the dismantling of USAID which bought a lot of crops from the farmers. The trade war and the tariffs were the second hit, causing massive, massive drop in orders for crops, beef, pork, you name it. Shifting government spending away from those states will be the third hit.  I don't see how the economies in some of those states will survive this. They could somehow survive the first two hits if there would be some major help from the federal budget. But now, instead, the cuts are gonna finish them off.",AlienInTexas,2025-05-02T13:45:09,2
"This is a pretty ridiculous headline. He isn’t cutting any actual funding for the government just shifting in from programs that help the poor and provide R&D to the military and homeland security. There actually is no spending cuts.  So we’re going to hurt the poor, cut taxes, cut R&D, spend the same and then be in worse debt with absolutely nothing to show for it? Fantastic.  Also, doesn’t he want Europe spending more in the military? Why are we spending 114 billion more dollars?!",Downtown-Claim-1608,2025-05-02T13:15:33,5

"The discretionary budget proposal is just absolute trash. One blatant one is trying to hide the cuts of clean water at EPA by saying they want an increase of 9 million for clean drinking water all while cutting 2.2 billion to the funds that the states use to garuantee it. Over all it is a 2.2 billion dollar cut to clean drinking water.   This type of ""sleight of hand"" is included throughout the budget proposal.   Like veterans may appear to get 3.3 billion mkre in medical care, but the cuts at HHS will have a far greater impact that a 3.3 billion gain would have on healthcare as well as major cuts at HUD making it worse for veterans who are struggling to find affordable housing.",Man_Behin_Da_Curtain,2025-05-02T14:43:04,1
1.6T deficit and with all of his crazy crap he is only cutting the deficit by 10%?  And the every day American will be hurt the most?  Up to 5200 a year average from tariffs?  Yeah total wealth redistribution.,ogreofnorth,2025-05-03T02:25:19,1

"Looks like we'll finally hit $1T annually for defense.  Meanwhile we're cutting funding for education, environment, healthcare, research, etc.  We're like my neighbor the gun nut who lives on peanut butter sandwiches so he can keep increasing his arsenal.",zubbs99,2025-05-02T13:46:31,0

"Correct. Restructuring the budget.   What stood out to me is when you see a list breaking down the restructuring, basically any program/dept/sector that is there to provide for US Americans is being slashed funding 25% or more. Homeland Security is going to see a 65% increase while Defense will see the biggest $ amount added. It makes me wonder why so much for Homeland Security (of which CBP and ICE now fall under that umbrella) and Defense while taking that from the services and departments that help Americans the most?   Dark times are close.",DLuke2,2025-05-02T14:06:09,5
