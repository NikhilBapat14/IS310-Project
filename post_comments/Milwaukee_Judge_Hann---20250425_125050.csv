"What a GOD awful choice of a headline to cover this story. Talk about burying the lede. It almost seems deliberate.  You MAY want to include in the headline the unprecedented arrest, even if given the benefit of the doubt and we assume that you have no room to also print that most legal experts say it was not a crime at all.  The arrest is the story. Not the accusation. Their flimsy excuse for cuffing her is something you cover as context in the first paragraph. You do not leave the fact that a sitting judge was actually ordered arrested by Kash Patel’s FBI out of the headline. There’s a very good reason most sources are leading with the arrest.  Jesus H. Christ, I hate that editors write the headlines and not journalists. It’s such an easy way to manipulate people, even when they’re not even trying to.",Lurlex,2025-04-25T13:14:35,10
What it looks like to me is that Trumps administration is doing this as a warning to all of the other judges involved in cases pertaining to Trumps other legal woes surrounding his many legal blunders.  Its clearly an intimidation tactic aimed at the American judiciary.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-25T12:57:02,7

So now FBI is the Gestapo who will arrest judges ruling against Trump. Where is the outrage? Isn't America is now a fascist state?,Brief_Night_9239,2025-04-25T19:50:46,1
Of course they are.   The truth is probably that Kash made up the cause and this gets thrown out.,TintedApostle,2025-04-25T13:28:22,4
