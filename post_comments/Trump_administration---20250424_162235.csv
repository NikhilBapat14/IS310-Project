How about we start arresting these ice and trump officials for acting in bad faith.,paxwells97,2025-04-24T16:39:56,22
"It's as if the Trump Administration just waits to see if they'll get away with what they're doing. They won't stop their illegal practices until America is as lily white as it can be. After that point, they'll probably start not allowing Euro-Americans to leave.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T16:34:51,5
"If there’s a precedent set that the commander in chief is above law while doing their duty, there is room for precedent set to be had for being held accountable in the eyes of the law when doing something that is NOT their duty or beyond their power.   SCOTUS really were the ones to fuck the country to say that the president (well… just one really shitty one) has unequivocal power.   These years will be in history books for centuries.",anon_savior,2025-04-24T23:06:47,2
"I've BEEN saying this. Whoever is in charge of carrying out the actual court order (obviously Trump isn't going to personally do it) that person needs to answer for it. It's always an anonymous ""they"". No someone is responsible.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T16:43:18,11
"Nobody will be safe just like in Russia. They can jail and torture you for any reason in a dictatorship. If Trump supporters dont like something that's going on (their kids being sent to war, bad medical, starvation, bad economic decisions) they won't have the right or free speech to speak out against it or they to will be imprisoned and tortured just like the rest of us.    It might not happen to them a year from now, 3 years from now, maybe not even 5 years from now. But eventually it will happen to them or someone in their family.   Not even the ultra wealthy are safe in this type of government because oligarchs are known for being offed on occasion. Nor will the journalists that helped sane wash trump during the election and sane washing his plans to take over Canada, run for a 3rd term, or jailing Americans or venezualns with no criminal record in a foreign prison with no due process.",paxwells97,2025-04-24T16:48:54,5
"Because our government is being treated like a corporation. Corporations famously do not have personhood status, therefore they get away with heinous acts regularly. Just look at how Amazon is the main driving factor in finishing off the USPS as a public service.",fumphdik,2025-04-25T01:11:29,1
Makes me glad to be a senior who will most likely be dead before things come to a head. My heart bleeds for my children and grandchildren though.,invalidpassword,2025-04-24T20:42:34,3
