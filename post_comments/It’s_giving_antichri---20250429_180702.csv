Also portrayed as a, “beast of the sea” not “orange as a rind”.

"Doubtful. Probably a third of Trump's administration is at least nominally Catholic.  Seriously, though... Lindsey's tweets lately have been SO completely over the top relative to any sentiment he's ever publicly expressed in the past, they've started to look like my passive-aggressive Amazon Vine reviews for products that arrive broken & I'm stuck paying the taxes on, but can't come out and SAY they were broken on arrival or Amazon's AI will auto-nuke the review and punish me by showing only cake topping decorations for a few days. So... I'll write a 2 or 3 star review where I focus on all the bad things about it, and make a point of uploading a few photos that make it blatantly, brazenly obvious that the words alone don't tell the whole story.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-04-29T23:40:58,1
"The following he has is indeed foolish but it’s simply not enough. It goes deeper than just admiration, the world would have to agree to make Trump their leader. The one world government angle is the real takeaway here. The Antichrist is supposedly enough to erase Christianity altogether, and that really would take global cooperation. Trump can’t even convince Canada to be a state, and that’s a soft ball compared to the rest of the world.  Nobody really thinks Trump is an amazing leader besides Republicans, and not even all of them are totally sold. Even if he had the greatest second term in American history the most anyone will ever adopt from him would be economic philosophy or scare tactics.",CyberMallCop,2025-04-29T21:57:33,1

"I photoshopped this from the original the week it came out in December 2016. I zoomed in a bit, and adjusted the text, lighting, color, and added the demonic glow (zoom in) to his eyes. He chose the chair from his own home… I loved that he didn’t realize how shabby his choice was, just like he doesn’t realize how shabby he is. He’s blind to his own shortcomings.  Here’s an excerpt from an article — written a year after the cover came out — that speaks of symbolism in the original cover:  [Forward.com](https://forward.com/culture/356537/why-times-trump-cover-is-a-subversive-work-of-political-art-even-a-year-lat/)  “The masterstroke, the single detail that completes the entire image, is the chair. Trump is seated in what looks to be a vintage “Louis XV” chair (so named because it was designed in France under the reign of King Louis XV in the mid 18th century). The chair not only suggests the blindly ostentatious reigns of the French kings just before the revolution, but also, more specifically, the reign of Louis XV who, according to historian Norman Davies, “paid more attention to hunting women and stags than to governing the country” and whose reign was marked by “debilitating stagnation,” “recurrent wars,” and “perpetual financial crisis” (sound familiar?).  The brilliance of the chair however, is visual rather than historical. It’s a gaudy symbol of wealth and status, but if you look at the top right corner, you can see a rip in the upholstery, signifying Trump’s own cracked image. Behind the bluster, behind the glowing displays of wealth, behind the glittering promises, we have the debt, the tastelessness, the demagoguery, the racism, the lack of government experience or knowledge (all of which we unfortunately know too well already). Once we notice the rip, the splotches on the wood come into focus, the cracks in Trump’s makeup, the thinness of his hair, the stain on the bottom left corner of the seat — the entire illusion of grandeur begins to collapse. The cover is less an image of a man in power than the freeze frame of a leader, and his country, in a state of decay. The ghostly shadow works overtime here — suggesting a splendor that has already passed, if it ever existed at all.”  https://preview.redd.it/qlyh4m2v4yxe1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58047beb4c296775ba3dfefd8738716cb5138bfe",uRok2Uc,2025-04-30T05:07:48,1

But it lead to a no good very bad dream. the kind you are soooooo happy to wake up from and realize it was just a dream. I dreamed I went all out confronting my entire family simultaneously (including cousins aunts and uncles half of whom have passed away) about their support of Trump! It was brutal. In fact I haven’t seen my family since before Covid but we communicate by text and phone. I live 1000 miles away from them.  It went on with some standard shenanigans that make so much sense to people who know me, including my siblings. I would love to tell them about it bc it was actually funny as hell in retrospect. But politics are the thing that must not be named among my siblings. NEVER. EVER. They are very conservative. It is a painful situation. My entire country needs a fucking exorcism and I feel like I am in a mad house half the time.  But thanks for the shout out! I miss thinking England was our good friend.
