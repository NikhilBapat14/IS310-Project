Trump can‚Äôt even convince Canada to be a state, and that‚Äôs a soft ball compared to the rest of the world.

"I photoshopped this from the original the week it came out in December 2016. I zoomed in a bit, and adjusted the text, lighting, color, and added the demonic glow (zoom in) to his eyes. He chose the chair from his own home‚Ä¶ I loved that he didn‚Äôt realize how shabby his choice was, just like he doesn‚Äôt realize how shabby he is. He‚Äôs blind to his own shortcomings.  Here‚Äôs an excerpt from an article ‚Äî written a year after the cover came out ‚Äî that speaks of symbolism in the original cover:  [Forward.com](https://forward.com/culture/356537/why-times-trump-cover-is-a-subversive-work-of-political-art-even-a-year-lat/)  ‚ÄúThe masterstroke, the single detail that completes the entire image, is the chair. Trump is seated in what looks to be a vintage ‚ÄúLouis XV‚Äù chair (so named because it was designed in France under the reign of King Louis XV in the mid 18th century). The chair not only suggests the blindly ostentatious reigns of the French kings just before the revolution, but also, more specifically, the reign of Louis XV who, according to historian Norman Davies, ‚Äúpaid more attention to hunting women and stags than to governing the country‚Äù and whose reign was marked by ‚Äúdebilitating stagnation,‚Äù ‚Äúrecurrent wars,‚Äù and ‚Äúperpetual financial crisis‚Äù (sound familiar?).  The brilliance of the chair however, is visual rather than historical. It‚Äôs a gaudy symbol of wealth and status, but if you look at the top right corner, you can see a rip in the upholstery, signifying Trump‚Äôs own cracked image. Behind the bluster, behind the glowing displays of wealth, behind the glittering promises, we have the debt, the tastelessness, the demagoguery, the racism, the lack of government experience or knowledge (all of which we unfortunately know too well already). Once we notice the rip, the splotches on the wood come into focus, the cracks in Trump‚Äôs makeup, the thinness of his hair, the stain on the bottom left corner of the seat ‚Äî the entire illusion of grandeur begins to collapse. The cover is less an image of a man in power than the freeze frame of a leader, and his country, in a state of decay. The ghostly shadow works overtime here ‚Äî suggesting a splendor that has already passed, if it ever existed at all.‚Äù  https://preview.redd.it/qlyh4m2v4yxe1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58047beb4c296775ba3dfefd8738716cb5138bfe",uRok2Uc,2025-04-30T05:07:48,1
