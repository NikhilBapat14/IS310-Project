"Give us real evidence elon. Give the American public real evidence and if it is real and unbiased, then people might support cutting waste. But I call BS on him going into multiple federal agencies and then just blanket firing thousands of workers because there was fraud. And somehow he did this all within the last 60 days. Bullshit Elon.   And how does firing thousands of people solve waste? All that is going to do is force them to claim unemployment and be unemployed putting further strain on the economy.      Give us real evidence of waste and fraud. Ohh you can't? Because there isn't any? Yeah that's what I though, fElon.",Vg_Ace135,2025-03-31T22:08:03,41

"I feel a severe disconnect when listening to the tempo of his dialogue. He is a terrible communicator and should not try to explain himself as he makes people feel extremely uncomfortable.

">I call BS on him going into multiple federal agencies and then just blanket firing thousands of workers because there was fraud. And somehow he did this all within the last 60 days.  Fired them *before conducting any reviews, audits or examinations*.  He pre-emptively fired them without any evidence at all, *and has submitted nothing to indicate that the actions were justified*.  It's important to include that.  Every media outlet, including this one, should be emphasizing that the jobs and agencies in question were terminated *before anyone even looked for waste or fraud*.  That's the key indicator that this is **not** about ending waste or fraud.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-01T06:35:57,8
