"I mean you can, if they break the law. Biden should have charged Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis with human trafficking. And in 2029, whichever Dem is President will need to deport non citizens Rafael Cruz and Marco Rubio to Cuba. They will also need to charge Trump for all of his various crimes. MAGA turned America into a banana republic and should pay for it.",LodossDX,2025-05-09T18:25:01,79
"What will the consequences be? Will anything be done to stop trump and his crew of fascists? The ice agents that carried out the illegal arrest, will anything happen to them?  What's actually going to happen here? Will it only be hand wringing and strongly worded statements?",cptbiffer,2025-05-09T18:49:17,30
Rep Khanna is correct because what Trump did is directly taken from Marcos Sr and President Duterte Republic of the Philippines PRC Xi Jinping Hungary Orban Kim Jong Un DPRK and Putin's Russian federation arresting political opponents. In 2029 if Dems win Trump Noem must be tried for this and their cruel policies of Deportation.,AceCombat9519,2025-05-09T22:50:29,10

"That's going to fall on completely deaf ears, given that the Dems did actually charge and indict Trump with various things, and would have arrested him if he didn't turn himself in. It was warranted, but that little detail won't matter.",SkyMarshal,2025-05-10T09:33:28,1

He was not protesting. Get your facts straight.,phillygirllovesbagel,2025-05-09T18:24:49,-18
Correct but for Trump he might find assylum in countries that are friendly to him. The Next dem president must declare Trump as a flight risk.,AceCombat9519,2025-05-09T22:51:35,17

Listen and/or watch the news. The mayor was not engaged in a protest at the time of his arrest.,phillygirllovesbagel,2025-05-09T18:55:46,-4
"Trump, I don't think, would not give up secret service detail. But, considering he set the precedent for removing people from having a ss detail, I guess he might not have one for long after he's impeached and removed from office, which at this point, I'm betting all my money on happens before his term is up, maybe even this year lol",BorntobeTrill,2025-05-09T22:55:05,8

Regardless he prolly got arrested for not being a Trump cult member.,opturtlezerg5002,2025-05-10T13:07:14,1
