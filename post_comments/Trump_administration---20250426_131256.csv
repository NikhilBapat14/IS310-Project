"It is pretty clear what will happen If you are pro-Palestine, whether you are a foreign or domestic, you better STFU. Both the Democrats and Republicans are united when it comes to going after pro-Palestine supporters.",xibeno9261,2025-04-26T13:15:50,3
Good to note that thereâ€™s Pro-Palestine protests and Pro-Palestinian protests. Originally I took them to be the same but you can support and advocate for the welfare of palestinian people but still be against the establishment of a Palestine state.  And naturally you can support the creation of a state of Palestine without necessarily prioritizing the welfare and human rights of the people though this would seem rare in the west and more of a Hamas or jihad mentality.  The protesters need to make this distinction clear so administration policy can be clear as well.,dbag3o1,2025-04-26T14:25:12,-2
