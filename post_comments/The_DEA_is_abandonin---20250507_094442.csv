Terrible idea. Body cams protect officers from false allegations just as much as they protect and provide transparency to the public,Lebesgue_Couloir,2025-05-07T12:55:02,898
Terrible idea,grecks530,2025-05-07T11:27:56,1862
"Of all agencies, DEA should be wearing two to prevent any corruption. The risk that some agents might be working for the cartels could upend the president's effort to secure the border.",IVcrushonYou,2025-05-07T10:23:28,1561
Why? This is a terrible idea.,deadzip10,2025-05-07T11:34:34,665

"No, this is not it. Bodycams should be mandatory for all law enforcement personnel.",gcr1897,2025-05-08T05:16:21,12
"Not a fan of this. I think the body cams are essential to protect both the LEO and the suspect.  However, it should be mandatory for any footage released to show the entire encounter (reference the George Floyd debacle.)",tengris22,2025-05-08T08:15:44,3
"I have questions.  First - really?  Are we **certain**?  If I had to count the stuff during Trump 1.0, and now Trump 2.0 that turned out to be absolute bullshit, I’d need a spreadsheet to track it.  Would anybody be surprised if this turned out to be made up nonsense?   Say it turned out to be that certain agents who don’t actually deal with criminals were inadvertently listed as being required to wear a body cam - and this simply removed those folks from the requirement. Who would be surprised?    Next - let’s tun with the assumption the article is absolutely correct.  Are we certain the body cams were useful for anybody - as in did they protect the rights of criminals, suspects, or the respective law enforcement officers?  It has actually been used rarely and is a hassle and time hole?    Mind you I’m not dismissing this at all, however we **all need to be skeptical from the get-go”.  **Stay Skeptical**      (but don’t be closed off)",cliffotn,2025-05-07T10:16:32,83
Bad idea. Body cams have been the lefts biggest gift to us. They proved that police brutality against black people is a myth. We should keep them because every video that comes out only helps our cause.,AFishNamedFreddie,2025-05-07T14:40:14,9
horrible idea,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-08T22:20:10,1
Body cams have been an own goal for the left. They never thought cameras would show just how often criminals turn ordinary encounters into life or death struggles.,raccoonbandit13,2025-05-07T10:29:39,-71

"They make sense on street cops, but not people dealing with organized crime where the cameras are going to reveal sources.  You can see that in a lot of bodycam videos of DEA busts where they handle it as a traffic stop for some made-up infraction to hide that they obviously had knowledge of who was running the drugs.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-07T13:52:09,-28
"In my experience of a quasi-law enforcement public safety job (campus security), bodycams help clean/good officers 99% of the time.  Having worn a body cam for 5 years, I can't recall a single time bodycam footage contradicted the overall narrative of an officer. Every controversial case I was aware of, the bodycam footage supported the officers' story and undermined the suspect/student's allegations.",Kaireis,2025-05-07T14:47:00,254
"I’m going to type the same thing to you guys.  Ok, but that’s not what I was speaking to.    I am not, and have not said body cameras are a great idea, or a terrible idea.

"Posted about an hour ago, + 294 Karma. The **post** only sits at +88 karma.  Folks that is NOT ORGANIC.    Lefties brigading.  Trump could sign America strong trade deals for all the world in one day, and that post wouldn’t get as much upvotes as this brigaded post does.   100% not organic  Mind you I don’t need any imaginary internet points, not dumb Reddit award or badges.  But lefties are brigading here hard and a lot, trying to **sway our opinion** by being fakes, liars, imposters, and using bots, alt accounts, and from what I’ve been told groups are organized off Reddit (discord I believe) and they gather and up/down vote this sub’s comments en masse.    The modus operandi is the same, make or latch onto a comment that looks like conservatives being skeptical, and upvote it like crazy and give the comments award for visibility - then downvote comments **like this one** into the cellar.  Just watch.  A simple comment to stay skeptical will be downvoted into oblivion.  Who here thinks conservatives downvote conservatives en masse for simply saying - don’t trust the media?     **TWO minutes ago and -10 Karma**    They aren’t even trying to hide it anymore.  Stand strong **actual** conservatives!",cliffotn,2025-05-07T11:12:19,-717
"I'm reminded of when the initial bodycam footage of George Floyd was released, like four minutes of the interaction, to portray it in a certain light, by officials, no less. The full 39 minutes of the interaction gave us the full context, but the damage those four minutes out of context caused was already done.",Panzershrekt,2025-05-07T11:18:36,41
"Most times this is true. Body cams, again for the most part, have shown cops do things correctly. Jacob Blake is the PERFECT example of this. Kenosha was still rioted but without the body cams showing why he was shot it would have been rioting on a whole other level.",WatchLover26,2025-05-07T11:17:45,72
"What are you talking about? I'm a pretty hardcore conservative, you can check my history. Trump ran on respecting the rule of law which this literally enables. How can you justify not wearing body cams? It actually protects the agent as well...",grecks530,2025-05-07T12:12:28,718
"This should be something both sides of the aisle hates, probably why even the *real* conservatives are slapping you with downvotes.

"I do believe some of the dissent *is* coming from real conservatives, therefore i very rarely call out the ""fellow conservatives"" getting hundreds of upvotes.

"If I had to guess and find justification, I’d assume it has something to do with privacy/safety of their confidential informants and agents. If they’re meeting with CI’s and it’s on body cam that would be a potential risk. Something must have happened that caused this to be a concern.  A lot of drug related law enforcement activity isn’t really typical and some grey area decisions. Undercover, CI’s etc would be at risk for any internal threat that’s paid for by cartel etc.",ACiDRiFT,2025-05-07T15:04:37,-116
"#I have not taken a pro/con position  I’ve said be **skeptical**, and I don’t think any conservative would disagree with that.  But I have NOT said, nor insinuated that I support, or oppose the idea at its face. I said I would like more details, I would like to see if it’s actually what the hell is going on.  I’m saying we might find out in three days that it’s complete bullshit, and the DEA is not eliminating one single body camera.  It also could be completely true, and at that point, I have an opinion, but I haven’t made it known, and I’m not gonna make it known because I’m talking about the **brigading**.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T12:43:44,-260

"I’ll have a good faith to and fro with a bonafide conservative all day long.   But this engagement manipulation is solar systems away from being bonafide engagement.  They stand out like a sore thumb.    This sub hasn’t seen comments get voted up or down like this forever, then shortly after Trump kicked Biden’s ass - bam - out of nowhere posts and comments are getting thousands of up or down votes  - often the actual post isn’t popular.  Then when I push back like I did here, I get PM’s galore from lefties, and like today probably 4 dozen replies to my comments, calling me MAGA Nazi or such, in subs that are even political.  They think they’re “getting” me, meh, block and move along.  Takes me 5 seconds, but they spent many minutes dinging my commented and spamming them over and over.    It’s not a well hidden secret.

That information shouldn't be spread beyond the department or an auditor. Or god forbid if the timestamp in question involves a possible crime and an informant at the same time and has to be used as public evidence. Either way not much of an excuse in the long run. If cartels are infiltrating any police org then there's a bigger issue at hand but a body cam isn't about to be accessed by some random cop to another.,Katzchen12,2025-05-07T19:01:02,43
"Yeah the brigading is insane atm. A clearly leftist view will be upvotes by more than a normal conservative view. They just don't like that we have our own community to share views in. Anyone not a leftist is not human to them and shouldn't have a voice even if they share most of their views. Musk is a prime example of this, he was by most means a leftist with some right leaning stances but then got forced out by the purest rage the left has. Its either you tow the line or you are everything we hate lol.  I've had the same pms before they try to call out the flaired only posting and its like you want to talk about leftist shit then its pretty much every where else but this sub.

"Yeah it seems like there are always very few conservatives who're actually against most things Trump is doing yet they always have hundreds of upvotes and awards. And like i said, every dissenting comment has almost only disagreements in the comments.  There have been a handful of things in this term that I've disagreed with and believed that others have also disagreed with, things like the Mike Waltz stuff, general 51st state sentiment, involvement in the Gaza Strip, and this post i believe a lot of real conservatives are disagreeing, but there aren't many more that i've actually believed is real disagreement.  Republicans are quite the unified party right now.

You know you’re complaining is really starting to sound like a lefty, right?   Yes brigading does matter.  Comments that are **bonafide, real conservative** takes end up being invisible, where as the lefty leaning comments are awarded and upvotes so they stand out.  You don’t think given how young Reddit is, and how impressionable all the young folks here are, that some may be inadvertently swayed in a direction that isn’t all conservative?  You don’t feel it’s better to engage in free speech, allow opposing voices to be heard?  Do you think it’s OK for the left to shout us down, and silence us? Because that’s what you’re saying.
