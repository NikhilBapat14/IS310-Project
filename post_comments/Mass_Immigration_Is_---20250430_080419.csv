Immigrants are great for businesses but terrible for American workers. It’s an effective way to lower wages and it breaks the backs of the working people. Imagine if we cut HB1 visas in half. Americans would have higher paying jobs.  Europe has felt it too.,DS_9,2025-04-30T11:57:17,44

EU was working fine with no borders. Until Germany signaled that the whole world can move there. And the whole union pays the price. I am afraid that eventually we will see another bloody Reconquista.,dankhorse25,2025-04-30T08:50:55,24
"Exactly, and all you hear the left say is ""But, Americans don't want those jobs.""  Right, we don't want those jobs at starvation wages. That's the problem.",XXXCincinnatusXXX,2025-04-30T14:03:42,35
">I am afraid that eventually we will see another bloody Reconquista.  We won't, because the people of Europe have no will to resist. They are spiritually broken.  What we will see it a collection of failed states that will look just like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc. already look like today.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-30T09:08:03,38
It’s both sides unfortunately. They are in cahoots on fucking American workers because their donors pay them to do so.,DS_9,2025-05-01T05:57:05,2
