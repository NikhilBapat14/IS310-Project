"This is what we need. People don't know about Latin American death squads common in the Reagan era in Central America who were funded by the US and trained by Green Berets. Right wing dictators would do this shit kidnap people in an unmarked van and take them off to be tortured or executed for being a liberal communist. My uncle was kidnapped once in Guatemala and he was driven off to the woods to be executed. He saw a gringo talking English he assumes as he had never heard English but he saw some white guy in a suit who stepped in before they killed him with a document he was looking at then at him back and forth, which I guess was a photo. He said something to the soldiers who were Guatemalans who turned to him and cut him loose saying ""Lucky day for you, you're the wrong guy. Run before we change our mind"". This is what happens when you let a dictator in power and history shows right wing dictators do not hesitate to kill and disappear their enemies.

"Society determined that the government couldn't do this already, but that was when the narrative was around Ruby Ridge and Waco. A Federal Building was bombed in retaliation, even though both of those triggering incidents were afforded all rights and due process. It was the mechanism of enforcement that was deemed out of line.  But now they say ICE can raid churches, schools, and private homes to execute warrantless detainments with no due process and not a finger is lifted to stop it.   If ICE can do this, then the ATF can. If the ATF can the FBI can.   And if they say the Federal Government can't, they will try with the Texas Rangers and other state agencies. And since Texas could ship migrants to sanctuary cities, why can't they take them? And why would Texas want to bring migrants under detainment to Texas? For labor in an ever more isolationist America and because they will be easy to count for representation.   If the National Electoral College map looks bad now, wait until Texas has a few millions detained migrants that count in the census, and they don't have to worry about the census count issue where red states don't get the boost from having migrants and blue states do because the migrants are safer in those states. That's why they have such a gripe about sanctuary cities. Remove them from Blue States and put them in Red States and you can have an election won with probably 42% of the popular vote because Blue States will lose electoral college votes and the Red States will gain them.   The House will also be tipped in their favor dramatically, especially if there are no more Federal Civil Rights. Gerrymandering will get even worse.

"Ignoring the Supreme Court has deemed these actions illegal, and the executive branch is ignoring their order, and that these black sites are being contested as illegal, is it not also true that the police in Nazi Germany had to follow “laws” and orders?  What is legal is not what is moral or right . For example if Police take action against somebody that murders an individual, you can very easily defend this action by calling attention to the crime itself and justifying the need to make an arrest or take a course of action.  But if smashing a young woman’s face off the concrete while she is holding a baby, to deny them due process and deport them illegally to an extrajudicial out of country black site where they have no rights is called out, and the only argument you can come up with his “they’re following the law“, maybe you should reconsider your reverence for the law.  Pretend for a moment you were the same voice supporting arrests when women could not vote in police were pulling women away from the polls. Or denying non-land owners the right to vote.

"Actually a dude in Minneapolis got away with this during the George Floyd riots.  Some cops were just driving around in an unmarked van shooting less lethals at random people they thought deserved it.  This guy got hit with one, assumed he was being shot, drew down and actually wounded one of the cops.  Then when they piled out of the van to shoot him he realized they were cops and proned himself out.  Cops roughed him up and arrested him.  Not only was his use for force found justified, he got a big chunk of change from the city.

"Yeah, three letter agencies tend not to use diplomacy once shots start popping off. Suddenly every circumstance that made it self-defence goes out the window and you end up with ten agents blasting your house up and down with 5.56 taking your whole family with them. When the time comes for a news story, all you ever hear is that the suspect shot at police/agents and *everyone* knows that's only something a criminal would do. (/s)   It's worth researching the hundreds of times government agencies have willingly assassinated US citizens and their families intentionally (I use the word intentionally because they willingly chose not to go the typical route of serving warrants during daylight hours on a confirmed scouted location of residence, and instead typically send special teams to break-in in the middle of the night to force self-defence scenarios).  Once you give the US government a reason to fire a shot, there isn't a thing on this planet that will stop them from taking your life, and you'll be lucky if you're the only one they kill.

"“Figure it out” is a little naive though. It would take over 150 years to give full due process to all suspected illegal immigrants and they must be detained for that period.

We would also need to massively increase the number of physical court houses built, hire about 10 more federal judges and attorneys (than even exist, and they’d all be hired by you-know-who). After these trials, we need to deport them, but to where? Country or origin is very difficult to discern for the undocumented and they have every reason to lie. We can’t simply drop millions of people from a warship into the ocean off the cost of Brazil, or Senegal, you know?  “We’ll figure it out” is laughable in its simplicity. This is a logistical nightmare. There’s a reason the Nazis decided to just mass gas the Jewish prisoners even though they were valuable laborers. The logistics are nightmarish.

"Shotguns have some myth tied to them from movies. Sure they have lots of energy but their primary means of death is still exsanguination, same as a handgun. Shotguns, in a normal configuration, you are lucky to get 5 rounds out of it, most likely with a manual racking of rounds each time. A handgun can have 15 rounds with no manual manipulation after each round.   Plus that energy needs to go somewhere. If you miss it will easily go through the wall, the next wall, the outside wall and maybe even through your neighbors wall depending on circumstances. A hollow point starts with less (but still plenty of energy) but it will shed that energy faster as it hits things because it’s designed to deform and ‘dump’ its energy into its target.   Manipulating a shotgun is much harder than a handgun. Corners, doors, doorways, even just getting it out from wherever you stash it is harder. It demands regular practice to stay proficient. A handgun is much easier to learn and you can practice much easier(hell, just make a pretend one with your fingers and practice clearing your house quietly late at night while everyone is asleep.)  Bats/clubs/swords are cool if it’s that or your hands, but they only work if you are in range and have room to swing to build force. Take away or limit either of those and a firearm is a better way to project force.   At the end of the day though you should know how your body reacts to stress. Fine motor skills almost universally go to shit when stress and adrenaline hit you. If you know that you can choose a firearm that you can still manipulate or practice manipulating under simulated stress to learn and reduce the likelihood of becoming just an armed liability to those around you. (think chunky full size vs sleek compact).   You also need to sit down and deeply assess your own willingness to commit to the force escalation long in advance. Pulling a gun takes things from 0-100 real quick, and the path to reverse it can be tricky both in the moment and in the court system after the fact.",sirdouchewaffle,2025-05-09T11:22:03,7

"You're right in that a warrant isn't always needed, but being undocumented isn't a felony or even criminal, and it's unclear from the article whether that's why they were being arrested or if it was that they had a green card but years ago were convicted of a crime that they were long since processed with.  It's very much worth noting the law here, because in addition to ""felony, exigent, etc..."" ICE has the authority to arrest if they have probable cause the person is removable under immigration law and the arrest happens in public or a non-private space.  ICE can't go into a home or private space and arrest unless they have a warrant or permission to enter.  I don't know if that what happened here, but the critical point I'm making here is never give permission to enter without a warrant.  Additionally, make sure that's a judicial warrant and not an administrative warrant (Form I-200).  ICE can't force entry with an administrative warrant.",mredofcourse,2025-05-09T15:10:51,2

However, Trump filled ICE and all the rest of the agencies with sycophants who will do whatever he says and threw out and replaced with his MAGA cronies anyone who would go against him.

Given that there's been several United States citizens kidnapped and forcibly shipped off with due process including infants, we have no way of even proving this woman, her baby or anyone else that's been deported is actually an illegal immigrant.  These people need to stay until they get their due process of law that proves they were here illegally, THEN they can be deported if that is found to be true.

"My argument:  1. Every single person, legal resident or not, absolutely deserves their constitutionally protected right to due process. 2. Residency and asylum cases are currently taking 2-3 years to litigate. Appellate courts are a nightmare. 3. There are simply not enough courts, judges or attorneys to properly\* give due process to 11-15 million undocumented immigrants. It would take a century. 4. Tax payer funded initiatives to hire more lawyers and judges, build more court infrastructure and detain this many people would likely be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  That's my argument. I'm not saying we shouldn't give them due process. I'm saying we need to be prepared for this to take a hundred years and potentially cost trillions if we're going to do it the ""right"" way. I'd rather just let all these people stay here. Grant them all amnesty, give every single person currently pursuing a green card full citizenship and completely open all of our borders. That's cheaper and would take months instead of centuries. But if we ARE going to go through with these deportations, we need to be prepared to spend outrageous amounts of time and money on it. And conservatives don't have the patience for either of those two things right now.  But the original commentator saying we need to, simply, ""figure it out"" is ridiculous.
