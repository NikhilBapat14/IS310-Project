"That's definitely what the knuckle tattoos mean.  It is phenomenally statistically unlikely that 4 sequential symbols could have MS-13 as a potential coded message when assigning each one a face-value letter or number. All of the ""dogwhistling"" experts on this website are going to turn into Stevie Wonder and close ranks because how disastrous the optics of defending this guy are. They want to bury this revelation because they're in too deep at this point.  As for the actual math, there are 1,697,616 possible combinations for four symbols that can be assigned A-Z or 0-9. It's a 0.000059537% chance! Even if you include some alt solutions like WS-13 or MS-C3 or MS-CS (there aren't many), the chance is still slim.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T21:15:49,12
"Hijacking top comment to state that the current bot-brigade is trying to say those pictures don't exist, and that Garcia doesn't have tatoos on his hands. Or that Trump photoshopped the pictures.  Daily Mail currently has a picture in the headline article of Van Hollen shaking hands with Garcia on Thursday, and the tatoos that the Trump administration asserts are indicators of MS13 affiliation are very clearly visible. They 100% exist as confirmed by the media covering this story.   Link in comment reply because automod might nuke my whole comment because of the link.",deciduousredcoat,2025-04-19T00:16:58,47

"Pic of tattoos from Trump:  .    ""This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‚Äúa fine and innocent person.‚Äù They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he‚Äôs got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things.
