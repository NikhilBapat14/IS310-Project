"When our districts are as large as they are, it makes it more difficult for smaller parties to break in. It takes a lot of time and money to win, and the major parties have built the infrastructure to do it. Repealing the permanent apportionment act of 1929 and reducing the size of districts by making them all equal, and the house larger, would most likely make it easier for 3rd parties to break in.",pitnat06,2024-07-31T11:44:27,106
"I'm not sure the premise is correct.   When I vote, there are third party candidates on the ballot for Congressional seats, especially for the Senate. That means their parties have gathered the necessary amount of signatures and met the ballot requirements to stand for election. They may not have enough members to be able to run candidates in all the House districts, but they are trying; they're just not successful.   The combination of first-past-the-post voting and single member districts pulls the majority of the electorate towards two parties. Outside movements that could possibly garner support get integrated into one of the dominant parties so as not to act as spoilers. All the incentives are geared towards having two dominant parties, so eventually, that's what you end up with.   This year is a perfect sign of that, because the Republican party is certainly divided enough to warrant a split. There's easily enough support to spin off a ""traditional"" Republican party that would automatically become the third largest in the US, but nobody has done it, because they know it means certain defeat for both factions.",nosecohn,2024-07-31T12:07:08,26

"From my understanding,  1. Duverger's law is a commonly cited reason, which basically is the idea that in a voting system where there is only one winner, there is a tendency for two main parties to emerge and for minor parties to serve more as a ""split vote"" or ""protest vote."" This is thought to be caused by voters tending to preserve their vote for a candidate who they think: (1) is most likely to win, & (2) who they are most willing to tolerate out of the likely winners. (Edit:) This also leads political actors to behave accordingly, as if they are legitimately running to win then they don't want to jeopardize their current nor future chances of winning by running for a party that isn't likely to garner enough votes  2. For the most part, the geographic concentration of most voters who are willing to vote third party has not been concentrated enough to secure the most amount of votes for any one election. In the cases where there has been enough of a concentration, it was typically something that was a sudden change (from one election to the next) as opposed to a party building their reputation over several election cycles.  So I think it's ultimately still a matter of perception among the electorate, but it's a perception that kind of reinforces itself",Difficult_Network745,2024-07-31T12:52:17,7
They do - we even have a few independent reps in congress and the senate. BUT most have extreme view and dont have the popular support to get enough votes. Most also dont have the funds to run campaigns against the major parties  with their corporate sponsors and political action committees.,tuna_tofu,2024-07-31T15:41:31,6

"Anyone who is actually interested in governing goes into one of the two major parties. It can be messy, you need to make endless compromises, but you can actually accomplish something.

"A major aspect is [first-past-the-post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting). The *""winner-take-all""* and *""survival of the fittest""* system always ensures that the *two* **strongest** options will always rise to the top. This creates a recursive echo-chamber that leaves little room for nuance. This means that people and politicians become ""big issue"" or ""single issue"" voters/politicians. These big/single issues are ones that can garner the largest swath of voters in one fell swoop. Abortion, guns, drugs, immigration, LGBT, taxes, military, etc. As an example, if you're a gay, gun-owning, black Christian woman...who should you vote for? Well, it's going to wind up being whichever party is likely to push the *single* largest issue you care about.  Lastly, I should note that third parties *actually do try*. But the reality on the ground is they usually do not have realistic, actionable policies. Libertarians, for instance, talk a big game by saying things like *""eliminate the Department of Education""* with no real details.",Obsidian743,2024-07-31T17:38:08,2
"Why do people love the idea of a third-party people so much? Media loves the third party renegade who straight down the middle. In reality, a third-party candidate is most likely a fringe of the polarities, like a Pat Buchanan on the right or Ralph Nader from the left.   We live in a government that 50.1% to 49.9% is 100% power. With that binary choice being a third party is dumb. You will never have power to enact your agenda.   Much better to be either a democrat or a republican. Only way to get elected and exercise power.    We didn’t do coalition government here.",CTCELTICSFAN,2024-07-31T17:39:54,2

"I wish they would, but I’m not sure that there are that many contentious people who want to be in office. When my son, at nineteen, voted for the first time (from home in Oregon via paper ballot), my husband and I sat at the kitchen table and voted at the same time and we all read the voters’ pamphlet together. After studying the various candidates running for governor, our son said, “most of these third party candidates seem sketchy as hell,” which cracked me up. He also pointed out that none of them seemed to have real jobs, they were all self employed, or consultants or unpublished authors or whatever.",Laceykrishna,2024-07-31T21:52:24,2

"To put this another way to what others have said, the U.S. has a ""first past the post"" system where only the person with the most votes gets anything. From a strategic perspective, the way this generally works out in the long run is that it's often more important to make sure you don't end up with who you don't want in charge rather than having everything you want.  Consider the current scenario. Right now, the Democratic party has within its constituents the following: people who consider you themselves far left, center left, center, people of color, women, high education, environmentalists, etc. (many of these overlap.) While each of these groups have different primary goals, none of their goals get accomplished if republicans get in charge, who generally oppose a lot of the issues many of these groups have. If, hypothetically speaking, 50% of the population is these democrat groups above and 50% Republicans, and then some third party comes along and ultimately peels 15% of the Democrat votes, then the final vote is 50% Republican, 35% Democrat, and 15% third party, leaving Republicans as the winner, and Democrats and third party now losing in many of their goals. Since the winner gets essentially everything, the Republicans get 100% of the power. Republicans could theoretically afford to lose another 10-14% to their own third party break off and still win, giving them all the power.  If we had something like a parliamentary system where you voted and then the Congress was proportional, then it would make sense to have third parties like other counties do. In the above example, the proportional government would be 50% Republican, 35% Democrat, 15% third party, and then coalitions could be made from there, but since every election has only one competition and one winner, its better from a strategic standpoint to join up with your closest ally than break off into small groups.",BiiVii,2024-07-31T13:55:47,2
"The simplest answer is that they don't put their focus on Congressional races because they still have no shot of winning. In the last 30 years, there's only been 2 candidates who have won seats in Congress without the support of 1 of the 2 parties, (Bernie Sanders and Angus King, both independents). The Green and Libertarian parties have very limited resources and spending that on ads for races that will bring their candidate from 1% to 5% is just wasting money. The smaller parties have a bit of a chance in elections on the state and city level, where a few candidates actually win seats.   On the national level, they have no shot but they use the presidential elections as a way to advertise the party and gather resources that they might be able to apply to the local races that they have a shot in.",Cyrus_the_Meh,2024-08-01T10:40:40,1
They need to start with showing they can govern things like school boards and towns before they try national politics.   In general they won't develop the party to the point it's a viable platform with enough people working to support it.  They simply run vanity campaigns which tend to elect the candidate opposed to their issue by taking away votes from the candidate who would be the second choice of their voters.,obxtalldude,2024-07-31T13:25:41,1
"Single-seat choose-one elections makes it incredibly difficult to break in from outside the two party system. If you're trying to increase third party representation you need to lower the barrier for third party candidates to get into office. This means something like [Approval Voting](https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/education/empower-voters) for single-winner elections and switching to multi-winner elections wherever possible, with a proportional method of awarding seats. The approval variant is [Sequential Proportional Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting). But systemic, long-term problems require systemic, long-term solutions, so you have to start by switching local contests to approval with a dedicated and organized group of friends and work your way to from there.",JoeSavinaBotero,2024-07-31T13:27:00,1
"If we had a greater diversity in the way our elections worked on every level, I would agree with you.  Unfortunately, running for congress still results in FPTP issues that can spoil the election for a less bad candidate vs an awful candidate.  You basically have to run a primary campaign within one of the two major parties in order to make this work.  DSA (Democratic Socialists of America) are currently doing this right now within the Democratic party, but you can see that this still results in numerous obstacles.  One of which is organizations like AIPAC, where large GOP donors can spend unlimited amounts of money, funnel it through AIPAC, so they can claim that one primary candidate is an antisemite because they don't support Israel strongly enough.  If there were more systems like, say, the California jungle primary system, or Maine's Ranked Choice Voting system, that could really improve the situation (I'm more pro RCV than Jungle primary, personally), but that would require members from within the two-party system to vote in favor of replacing a system that generally benefits their entrenched position as incumbents.",wrestlingchampo,2024-07-31T14:12:47,1
"Go even smaller.  If a third party thinks they have a good plan and ideology for governance, getting elected in local government is pretty doable.

"That’s true, but realistically is that something we should strive for? I feel like it’s possible that having more representatives makes it harder to pay attention and hold them accountable.

">Anyone who is actually interested in governing goes into one of the two major parties.  This is also something that gets missed by a lot of people.

The further up you get, the more support and mentorship you get. At that point, it would be nearly impossible to shirk that off to try and run third party.

"No, third party folks are interested in democracy. The idea that parties should not rule, people should. It’s really that simple. There’s really a lot of electoral realities though that create feedback loops. For example, how difficult is it to get a new party on every ballot across the US? Only places with enough motivation and favorable state laws will field their candidates. If you look at the maps where third party people running, this becomes clear.

"I completely disagree. The problem we are facing right now in our country is that we've become so angrily divided by the two parties who so far to their respective sides that they seem to have forgotten that a huge part of the population lives in the middle. Like for example, I believe in the Democratic principals regarding citizens rights. However, I feel like they spend money like it grows on trees. I feel that Republicans claim to want conservative values and support families. Which is great. Until you realize that what that really means is they want to be able to tell you what your family should be able to do. How about we move towards the middle ground where people actually make the decisions that are best for their own families and we leave the government out of it. Where is that political party? Where's the political party that is tired of trying to make the other side seem racist and actually focus it's efforts on actually building communities in which EVERYONE thrives?
