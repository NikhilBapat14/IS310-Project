Election fraud for someone who is not even running in an election.,Visible-Extension685,2025-04-28T10:46:47,12
"**From Steve Benen, producer for ""The Rachel Maddow Show"":**¬†  The data suggests much of the public has not yet felt the direct impact of the White House‚Äôs tariffs, for example. And once the consequences of the administration‚Äôs trade policies start affecting Americans‚Äô lives and wallets, it‚Äôs easy to imagine Trump‚Äôs floor sinking further.  For his part, Trump has seen the shift in public attitudes, and he‚Äôs ready to reassess the direction of his failing presidency.  No, I‚Äôm just kidding. He‚Äôs actually lashing out at pollsters in new and ridiculous ways. Newsweek noted:  President Donald Trump has said pollsters that have shown his approval ratings sliding in recent weeks should be investigated for ‚Äúelection fraud.‚Äù Trump cited recent polls from The New York Times, ABC News/The Washington Post, and Fox News, which put his approval rating on 42 percent, 39 percent, and 44 percent respectively.

Does this bumbling moron think the DOJ has unlimited resources? They aren't going to be able to investigate everyone he dislikes,gradientz,2025-04-28T10:52:21,5
Trump should investigate the mirrors as well. They make him look dumpy.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-28T11:00:32,3

The sad part is that these news organizations will often bend to his desires.,mahermaid,2025-04-28T10:53:12,1
I predict a tariff lift in the very near future. What‚Äôs more important to Trump?  Popularity or winning?  He‚Äôll look like a hero. We‚Äôll see I guess. Political exhaustion exists.,gentleoutson,2025-04-28T10:53:25,1
"The small silver lining here amongst all the coming pain is how brazenly Trump touted and promoted his tariffs. The world pushed back and he blinked. It showed the world that he is a coward and can be easily caged. When the other shoe drops in a few months, Trump will have a very hard time deflecting. It‚Äôs not just Democrats telling the people this is Trump‚Äôs recession, it is the world.   ‚ÄúBiden did XYZ‚Äù won‚Äôt fly as well this time around, but I am confident we will still have a solid amount of idiots left to lap it up.",time_drifter,2025-04-28T11:49:37,1

That's how far his mind has gone.  I think he thinks he's in an election year. he's waiting to find out if he won Canada,coatofforearm,2025-04-28T11:12:10,4
It is hard for him to call Fox News polling fake. Their results are consistent with other outlets.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T10:46:20,3
"The odds he even really knows the capacity of the DOJ seems remote. After all, he did make the claim within the past couple of weeks the reason he is skipping due process for deportees is because he thinks there's not enough resources to adequately prosecute all migrants. Considering his attacks on the justice system, it'll be fascinating (morbidly) to see what happens when he creates more enemies than allies in the system.",woodworkerdan,2025-04-28T13:43:56,2
