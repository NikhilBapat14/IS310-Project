They are all so pathetic,Shooting-Joestar,2025-04-30T18:37:50,21
Was there actually any doubt?,dark_descendant,2025-04-30T18:49:51,6
so stupid. they had their chance,Responsible-Bat-5390,2025-04-30T18:50:54,5
Keep re-introducing it. Hammer home the message that Trump is wrecking the economy on every platform.,FuzzyCub20,2025-04-30T19:04:26,6

"How convenient that the one Dem they needed to show up didn’t lmao. I can’t believe that the majority of the US population still buys into this fake two-party system. The two party facade is going to shambles quicker than they both hoped it would and there is no more denying the fact that neither party gives a flying fuck about ANY OF US. The Dem not showing up to vote is by design. Keep the status quo going by all means. Maybe more libs, who laughably call themselves leftists, will wake tf up now and stop hoping that the Democratic Party will save them. Both parties solely work for their corporate overlords. Point. Blank. Period. All we have is each other at this point. It’s beyond time for the brainwashed libs and conservatives to deprogram themselves of hating each other when we should be hating our do-nothing politicians and the billionaires who tell them what to do. All of the intentional pinning against each other the GOP and the Dems have sowed upon us to keep us too busy hating each other to distract us and keep us from hating them, The TRUE villains. This needs to stop NOW. All of us have way more in common than y’all would like to think we do. There are more of us than there are them. It’s time to do something about this because neither party is going to save us. They are working together to keep us down. Wake the fuck up people.",caprikaironic,2025-04-30T20:24:43,2
"I am not knowledgeable enough about this to be an authority. I’m more hoping someone who does know better will either confirm or refute this idea?   Is it bad I am glad it failed? If democrats keep pulling these idiots out of the fire, they aren’t going to suffer enough to snap out of this. At what point is limiting the damage to the economy enabling the republicans to look competent and allowing them to continue their horrible social policies?   I’m suggesting, possibly, Democrat politicians going “on strike” when it comes to anything not targeting vulnerable individuals. If it’s going to hurt republicans just as much, or more, then everyone else? Let it pass. Abstain from the vote.",Big_Pair_75,2025-04-30T23:14:52,1
I have a feeling even if the senate passed this resolution he would just ignore it and we would be even further into a constitutional crisis.,redmoon714,2025-04-30T23:20:04,1
Republicans call for vote when they know opposition isn’t present.    Fuck fascists.,masstransience,2025-05-01T00:05:27,1

If Sheldon Whitehouse had been in the country it would have been 50/49 in favour.,Limberine,2025-04-30T18:59:11,7
Stupid that one was out of the country.,Limberine,2025-04-30T18:59:28,3
Run the ads this can all end but these people said nah,cowboi,2025-04-30T22:44:52,2
"I'm sure if Sheldon was there, they would have worked over one of the Republicans to vote against it.",dark_descendant,2025-04-30T19:08:08,4
Exactly. They vote count the hell out of this stuff and the GOP sets the floor agenda. They probably timed it so he'd be out in order to avoid having to shake down another R.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-30T19:55:29,3
I imagine the order goes the other way: they held the vote _because_ someone was out of the country.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-30T19:56:19,6
"Mitch McConnell,  who has spoken strongly against tariffs,  didn't have the intestinal fortitude  to join 3 other Republicans to vote for it either.",Winterwasp_67,2025-04-30T19:21:04,7
"The republicans who voted with the dems were pretty brave, they must believe it’s important. I wonder what the vote would have been if it was anonymous:",Limberine,2025-04-30T20:20:32,1
Bitch Mitch only cares about his bank account.,2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-30T20:00:23,3
Not really brave if they knew it wasn’t going to pass. It’s called virtue signaling.,JewsieJay,2025-04-30T22:19:35,2
Trump won’t be happy about it. GOP voting GOP is supposed to be  the virtuous path.,Limberine,2025-04-30T22:38:19,1
