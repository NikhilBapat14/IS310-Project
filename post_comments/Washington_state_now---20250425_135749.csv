First time homebuyers programs like this have existed for decades though. It’s also how we were able to buy our first home. I’m just confused as to why they’re doing them specifically for black people? It would’ve always gone to someone who was most likely to pay the loan back or meet the terms of the deal so is the insinuation that they were already (en masse) at the bottom of the list? Because if so that smells like 2008 market crash level of lending to me.,itsyagirlblondie,2025-04-25T16:14:07,44

"Also, this whole bill was brought on by a black gentleman whose family was supposedly pressured in selling their land to the school board in 1968 for $44,500 (which in todays money would be ~$408k) and then the school board ended up eventually selling the land to a developer.   The whole thing is disingenuous. The average home price in WA in 1968 was $24k. So they got a great deal for the time. Their gripe is that they would’ve purchased the land back had the school offered it back to them instead of selling to a developer.   To say that this original issue was a marginalized or racially motivated one is crazy to me.",itsyagirlblondie,2025-04-25T18:03:21,24
