"They’ve spent decades preparing for a point where they will never have to be concerned with polls again.   Defying the Supreme Court, readying the military for domestic operations, arresting judges, has stopped nothing. So no, I don’t hold out hope that a small dip in poll numbers means we are on the verge of anything changing.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-30T14:32:54,24
"At least we no longer have to delude ourselves by giving any conservative Republican the benefit of the doubt any longer: They are truly the sworn enemy of freedom, democracy and the American Way.",Electric_Conga,2025-04-30T14:46:19,7
"I like [David Frum's take on Trump's possible aftermath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSII6g5lDSY&t=3105s), in that maybe we'll learn from America's mistake with Trump and grow from it. The rational realist in me recognizes it's unlikely, but the dumb optimist holds out hope nonetheless.",interwebz_2021,2025-04-30T14:36:25,6

Is everyone in America just braindead now? Polls? We’re going to rely on polls saving the democracy? Fucking unbelievable.,once_again_asking,2025-04-30T15:10:00,4

"But but but, his has been the greatest 100 days of a sitting president ever, in the history of the world. He’s a greater president than Lincoln, Washington, and any Roosevelt could ever hope to be. He is amazing, courageous, and his absolute genius will elevate the economy to new heights never seen by any American. He is a fantastic, tender, and amazing lover with a wondrous, muscular, rippling body; and no one knows this, but secretly a fantastic concert pianist, owing to his long, slender dexterous fingers! He is the greatest human to ever walk the face of the earth!   Ok, now that that’s done, we can begin this cabinet meeting.",SteakandTrach,2025-05-01T09:39:59,1

Article could have been written in 2016. That’s how long they have been writing editorials with this sentiment.  That Trump is failing and his popularity will crash any day now.,Brumfieldhm,2025-04-30T15:42:09,-1

"They will be a lot less obedient if Trump is extremely unpopular. Right now, Trump is more popular than the Republican party, and crossing him is the end of your career. Flip that calculus and make stopping Trump the better thing to do politically, and they will start standing up to him. Tanking his popularity is the only way to stop him. We need to be doing everything we can to make him less popular.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-30T18:42:21,4

"If you need a reason to be optimistic, dropping poll numbers and ultimately support in the only thing that will stop him.  We know Congress won’t, so far the Supreme Court has done nothing.  So until elected members are more scared of losing re-election than retaliation from Trump very little will change.  Low polling is at least a tiny indication support is dropping.",funguy07,2025-04-30T15:04:59,15

"The thing is this: it doesn’t matter why they’re doing it. The fact is they are doing it while fully aware of the consequences.  Don’t get lost in the argument about, “why”. It gives room to validate it.  It’s happening. They know it’s happening. They know what will happen as a result. They let it happen anyway.  To say they are unfit is too small a description.

They are absolutely exploring that option.  That’s what the Trump 2028 is all about.  They’ll never cancel the election.  They’ll just rig it like Putin does.  He was “democratically” elected to be president of Russia.,funguy07,2025-04-30T15:37:25,2

"The relevant section and some doom and glooming for those curious about the argument being (not) made.   > we have tools in America that many other failed democracies lacked, like an independent judiciary that has ruled against Trump 70 times since he swore his oath.    The courts have shown themselves not to be the same sort of spineless sycophants that Congress has turned out to be. However they have very little real power or authority in the Machiavellian sense. They have no following, so supporters, no sworn soldiers, and no enforcement mechanism that isn't dependent on the good will of people *who have no obligation to them*. Their power (outside the pretty words in a 200 year old parchment) is derived entirely from the deference of Congress and the executive. Furthermore the recent actions of the supreme court reek of individuals attempting to secure their status in the ""after"".   >We have a free press that Trump loathes but can’t stop.    Seeing as a member of that press wrote this the only thing I have to say is: Scoreboard?     >We have state governments, with 23 controlled by Democrats.    This one I have no argument against. Fundamentally the federalist system absolutely empowers the governors in a way analogous to the president, the state executives differ from the federal mostly in size, but there is nothing sworn to the US that isn't first sworn to a state. In many very real ways the governors/states have more power over an individual's life than the federal government could dream of. People often feel a stronger connection to their governor than their president. The prohibition on a standing military would last mere minutes if states went into open revolt.     >This is not Hungary or Turkey or Iraq — our democracy has deep roots that go back 250 years.     The age of the system is less than irrelevant when it's failing with the exact same symptoms that every failed democracy has exhibited.",Aacron,2025-04-30T21:37:47,1
