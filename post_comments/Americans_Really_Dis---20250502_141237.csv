A few days ago there were ZERO ships unloading in the port of Seattle, and the Los Angeles port expects a 35% drop in volume.    I figure it takes about two weeks for stuff to get from US ports to stores. Most retail outfits carry as little inventory as possible (""just in time"" inventory) so those last shipments will hit the shelves less than a week later.  Yes, some retail stocked up in anticipation of the tariffs but most don't have the space for it, if they have the money  So it's all over by the end of May.

He thinks the stock market is the economy, so everytime it goes up, he thinks he's doing a great job.  The stock market is run by retail investors. There is a constant inflow of money to the market, so the numbers tend to go up. The value of the stocks are really based on perception. The companies actual value, earnings, and performance are not accurately reflected by the stock price. Wall Street is a casino. The idea that all of a sudden America will make all of its own products and sell them to Americans and the world is ridiculous. Most American companies currently do not have the capability to produce all their products in the US. It would take many years and millions and millions of dollars to get to the point where production in the US is even possible. Then, the cost of the products would be completely out of reach for almost every consumer in the US and even higher outside the US.  American isolationist ideology is not good for business.

I want to say, ""That was easy"". My key action was to buy. It's a motto I've copied from being a Californian. I want the respect, I had as a consumer moments before inflation took the nation on with products given to us via discounted production. What I bought that has influenced this educating value was purchased from the 99 cent grocery store chain. It was an professional oil pouring device cooks used.

"I'm stoned and went on rant  It's splitting hairs, but Kamala had a pinch over 75 million votes. And unfortunately, the Dems refuse to admit that Israel was the albatross around the party that Putin wanted it to be. They let it be the same albatross that ""wokeism"" was before it. They elevated the opinions of fringe extremists and painted the whole party with it. It drove center-left to the hard right.   They used trigger issues like gun control and pro-life to suck them into a world of hate. Once they captured them with a single adjacent issue, they slowly flooded them directed media. Zuck built the perfect to tool to exploit the gullible. It's not necessarily an intelligence issue. I would say many are highly intelligent. They can hold together a pretty complex fact pattern and regurgitate it pretty accurately and consistently.   I watched it happen with Joe Rogan (and many of his listeners). I didn't watch him from the beginning, but well before Trump and Covid. He was just some comedian who had interesting guests in long-formart interviews. The guy rarely had outright political guests or topics. If he voiced any opinions of politics or social issues, they were 99% significantly on the progressive side.   It was the 2nd Amendment stuff with him. It was all over after he moved to Texas. After covid, it was a done ballgame. I haven't considered turning it on in several years. Long before he went full Trump supporter.   On its best day, his sub was a flaming trash-heap. I had to abandon that too. It was always a cesspool, and for a time it was dominated by one side of the fringe. It now seems to be dominated by the other. I peaced out for like a year. I came back and it seemed like I could hang. It took a few clicks into the comments section to find nothing but anti-Isreal extremism in many of the posts.

"I agree Dems can improve in all of those ways. Blame can be assigned to non voters for the harm they caused, and everyone should of course vote. But it is ultimately the Democrats responsibility to drive turnout for their party.  You mention Gaza being an important issue, and the Democrats held an insanely unpopular position by refusing to limit weapon sales to Israel or make any real efforts to achieve a ceasefire. People who thought Trump would be better were incorrect of course, but the best political strategy is the most obvious one: pivot to address the widely held beliefs of your constituents and stand up for what is right.",Mutant-Cat,2025-05-02T19:17:59,2

"I hope you're right, but I don't think you are. It wouldn't be the first time capitalists capitulate to fascists. Also, a recession is spring sale for the extremely wealthy. When all small businesses go bancrupt, the big corporations buy them up. There's always money to be made in a crash if you have a leg up.  But I have to ask, what exactly can the billionaires do? Back another candidate? Not really an alternative in fascism. If they only have one king they will kiss his ass to keep him off their back.  I think you are engaging in wishful thinking. This has happened so many times before in other countries, and trust me the extremely wealthy aren't the ones who try to stop it. They are the first to adapt to a new status quo and then later fight to conserve it",Tegurd,2025-05-03T07:08:28,2
