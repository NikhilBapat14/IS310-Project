"Kid rock is fake as hell. He came from wealth. His dad owned a car dealership and a stable and horses growing up.   ‚Äúhe actually grew up in pretty privileged circumstances. The 5,660-square-foot house in Bruce Township, Mich., about 40 miles north of Detroit, has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, and it's situated on a 5.5-acre lot.  Kid Rock has a rough-and-tumble image, but he didn't exactly grow up in humble circumstances. His childhood home was a 5,660-square-foot luxury home in Michigan, situated on 5.5 acres that includes 5 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, 5-car garage, along with a partially finished walkout and guest house. There's also a 3 stall horse barn, regulation tennis court and inground pool. The 22-room house was renovated in 2004, and it also has a hot tub and a wet bar.
