Expect to see a flood of these types of stories in the coming weeks. They can only hide their abhorrent behavior for so long.,AllynCrane,2025-05-07T10:54:55,15

">The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has found U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who fatally beat Mexican father Anastasio Hernández Rojas responsible for acts of torture. It’s the first time the independent commission, which investigates extrajudicial killings and human rights violations, has issued such findings against a U.S. law enforcement agency. In 2010, Rojas was crossing the southern border in an attempt to return to San Diego, where he’d lived for 25 years, to reunite with his wife and five children after being deported. He was stopped by border agents, who brutally beat and tasered him while he was handcuffed, until Rojas died from heart failure. His death was later ruled a homicide.  >This comes as President Trump’s nominee to head Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, is accused of obstructing the criminal probe into Rojas’s killing.  >The decision “exposes the unchecked powers of policing in the United States and holds the United States accountable for what is one of the worst violations in human rights, which is the taking of a life,” says Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego.",ZuP,2025-05-07T11:01:03,3
"Just for clarity, here’s the timeline: - CBP’s torture and homicide of Rojas occurred in 2010 - the coverup occurred during Scott’s 2020-2021 tenure as Chief of USBP - IACHR’s report was published last week (Admissibility and Merits Report No. 60/25 on Case 14.042) - Scott’s nomination to head CBP is ongoing",ZuP,2025-05-07T11:12:28,7
