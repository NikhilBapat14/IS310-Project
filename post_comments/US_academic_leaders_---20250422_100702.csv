"The worst thing you do as a victim of extortion is to give in to the extortionist's demand.  The minute you give in to the extortionist, the extortionist owns you.   The world learned this with Hitler.  Now it is relearning it it with Trumpler.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T10:12:22,6
"Article highlights:  >Over 170 university, college and scholarly society presidents published a joint statement on Tuesday opposing the Trump administration's treatment of higher education institutions, coming together to speak out after Harvard University said the administration was threatening its independence. > >The statement, signed by presidents from such institutions as Princeton, Brown, Harvard, the University of Hawaii and Connecticut State Community College, criticized what it described as ""the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education."" > >""We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,"" the statement said. ""However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses."" > >The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the statement. > >Tuesday's joint statement is the latest show of resistance from U.S. higher education leaders as the Trump administration seeks to leverage its financial heft to overhaul academia.  It's unlikely the administration will pay much heed to this, at least for now. But it's still good to see these institutions taking a stance on the matter.",Hrmbee,2025-04-22T10:09:31,3

Going to be a lot of universities soon whining when the MONEY is cut off.  No reason to be funding for profit organizations to begin with.,Odd-Seaworthiness330,2025-04-22T10:26:43,-8
What does that mean? The federal government provides substantial funding to for-profit organizations. They’re called “companies”. They do work under contract just like non profit universities do. Both charge indirect costs. The difference is that companies mark up their prices beyond that in order to make an actual profit.,Gnomeknown,2025-04-22T10:46:15,5
