"He'll end abortion. He says he has never lost an election. He's planning a coup. He intends to prosecute and lockup his political rivals. Project 2025 is HIS blueprint to governance. Tariffs are the most beautiful word in the American language.  Should we expect ""He's the next Hitler!"" will make any difference? Even if he is?",YallerDawg,2025-05-05T10:28:14,17
"I don't think so.  Russia, in its entire history, was only a 'true' democracy between 1991 and 1999, and even during this 9 years it wasn't really a true democracy in a way that Americans would understand.   Of all the countries that have some sort of dictatorship or authoritarian rule, none went from being a democracy from their hundreds, or 1,000+ year history of democracy into authoritarianism.  I am not saying that it can't happen, but my point is that in all of these countries there are long histories of mono rule in one form or another or intermittent switching between democracy and dictatorship.",crucial_geek,2025-05-05T08:03:36,16
