"One thing that isn't talked about nearly enough is how little credibility Trump has with the other countries and world leaders he's trying to extort & exploit. They all recognize him for the absolute buffoon that he is - even the fascist dictators who pretend to be his friend. In fact, his American cult of brainwashed imbeciles are the only people on earth who legitimately respect him. People who actually understand international trade and economics have long since realized that Trump is a moron. Just an absolute jackass clown whose confidence exceeds his actual skill or talent or competence by several light years.   Have you ever been threatened by a buffoon? How do you react? ""Ok buddy, suuuure, you go ahead and do that …"" The kind of shit he's trying to pull off only works when the party on the other side of the table respects you. He thinks the rest of the world respects him, but they don't. They know he's a corrupt idiot surrounded by bootlicking parasites, and they know how easily manipulated he is by flattery and bribery.   They ARE scared of him, though … but for different reasons he & the MAGA cult thinks. They're not scared of his analytical skill, or negotiating prowess, or his strategic genius … they're scared of him the same way you'd be scared of a 5 year-old boy standing on your roof holding a live grenade. ""Please come down Billy … let's put the grenade down and go watch cartoons. You can have all the Skittles you want. Easy, Billy … eeeeeeeasy there buddy.""   The point is, even beyond the absurd idiocy of these tariffs and this trade war, he's accomplishing literally nothing while only serving to further diminish his already paper-thin credibility on the world stage.   Way to go, America!",oingerboinger,2025-04-29T11:00:59,2

"Wow, what a wild ride these first 100 days have been! Trump's self-dealing ways are definitely causing a stir in his Thugocracy. Let's see what happens next!",Individual_Tie_3926,2025-04-29T10:58:49,0
