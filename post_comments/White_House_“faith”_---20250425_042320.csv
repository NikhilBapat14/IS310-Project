"My wife and I went to a family member's wedding last year, and the pastor gave a very odd sermon about exactly this: wives submitting to their husbands, how it's a good thing, and trying to contextualize it further so it seems more palatable to everyone, but after it was over,  I remember looking at my wife and going, ""that was weird, yeah?""  *Strong* head nod of approval and a general look of ""wtf kind of wedding did i just witness"". It just threw us off, the rest of the wedding was fine, the reception was good, normal music and dancing going on, and a bunch of female fight songs playing with the bride and her gals  singing along... so the sermon just seemed out of place with the rest of the wedding and even the couple themselves.

"Not that it will do any good, but I've dropped a message to the White House on this. Feel free to steal it and make it your own.   This administration's witch hunt under the guise of ""religious freedom"" and ""Anti-Christian"" actions is sickening. The US is not a Christian country, nor should it be. You do not have the authority to make it so or treat it as such. If your administration is to investigate religious-based discrimination, it needs to do so across the board. Your actions show blatant disregard for the existence of other religions, all of which have legitimate cause to cry ""discrimination,"" unlike any sect of Christianity. It is not the government's place to dictate what people believe, or how they should think. The mere existence of a faith office led by an evangelical that insists women must ""submit to men"" is an attack on religious freedom, not to mention appallingly sexist and misogynistic.   Paula White and her entire office are an insult to what this country stands for and sending the DOJ on an ill-informed, ludicrously biased search for Anti-Christian nonsense is a misuse of the department as well as taxpayer dollars.",nomiseenomido,2025-04-25T10:14:55,5

"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top.

"I guess I could have worded it better, thanks for your question.  What I mean is: by saying it‚Äôs more like 1000 years ago (i.e. the current situation is similar to the situation a 1000 years ago) is not a fair comparison at all. Extrapolating this it would mean the situation a 100 years ago would be kind of OK for women, which I feel is an underestimation. A woman living a 100 years ago reading that could/ would feel disrespected by the underestimation of her situation.  While writing this down I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs probably not very clear, let me try something else.  I think we often forget how recently certain rights for certain groups have changed. F.i. I‚Äôm white, and married to someone of a different race‚Äî that was ILLEGAL in the US until 1967.  So for interracial couples in the 50s in the US, this was still a very real struggle. Only 75 years ago.  So saying smt like ‚Äòmaking interracial marriage illegal again is throwing us back a 1000 years‚Äô feels somewhat disrespectful to the couples who were feeling the very serious consequences only 75 years ago.
