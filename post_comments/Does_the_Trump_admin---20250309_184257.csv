"The election was won with 49.8% of the vote and a 1.5% spread between first and second place.  A plurality, not a majority.  A thin margin of victory.  Absolutely not a mandate by any objective standard.",I405CA,2025-03-09T18:48:52,130

"IMO we have learned the following from this election:  \- Margins don’t matter, only victory  \- Your mandate is defined by your boldness, your willingness to break the rules, and the strength of the opposition.  Trump and MAGA are bold AF, have no qualms about breaking any rules (or laws), and the opposition has no leg to stand on. Any in-party opposition (which other presidents had to deal with) has been neutered by MAGA in this case, so there are no guardrails.

"The whole concept of mandates is mostly made up. You're either president with all the powers of the presidency or you're not. A president planning on seeking reelection may feel incentivized by a closer election to pivot more to the middle than they would if they win by a landslide, but there's no requirement they do so and Trump has no such motivation because he can't seek reelection and half the country will always hate him.",Grand-Inspection2303,2025-03-09T19:22:50,3
"Few presidencies have an actual mandate that Trump is claiming. Elections are usually decided on a handful of small issues. Pardoning Jan 6'ers, eliminating USAID, doing massive layoffs without any discretion or due diligence, the federal spending freeze -- these are not the issues that got him elected, these are not the issues he campaigned on. Indeed, the plan for all this -- Project 2025 -- is something he directly contradicted on the campaign. And yet he's doing it. It's overreach, especially the illegal actions that breach the separation of powers and broach his oath to the constitution (such as trying to suspend the 14th amendment by mere Executive Order).  That said, discussion of mandate is mostly meaningless -- the opponents always deny it, the winner always claims it, and the winner will do whatever they can get away with. There's no repercussions until there's a midterm.",TheOvy,2025-03-09T19:28:31,3
"A ""mandate"" is an opinion.  He won the election so he's the president.  But if ""mandate"" means he has wide approval for his actions then he certainly does not.  Less than half of the electorate voted for him and his approval rating although higher than I think is reasonable is still way too low to be considered a mandate.",MonarchLawyer,2025-03-10T10:45:13,3
"If he can maintain control of the republican party (SCOTUS included) he can do what ever he wants.      As far as an electoral mandate, it is the closest election in modernity and Trump spent the last 3 months of the campaign denying any connection to project 2025, which he is now attempting to enact, so I say there is very little claim to a mandate.",koske,2025-03-09T18:57:17,6
"I think you've already answered your own question just from the past comparisons- the administration likes to frame it as a mandate from the EC votes, but even those are relatively slim in comparison - the popular vote makes more sense when talking about a mandate and that is the slimmest popular majority/plurality vote since 1968 (excluding the past couple R victory cycles where they did not even win a plurality of the popular vote).  The republican party since Bush II is incapable of a popular vote mandate hence the move toward gerrymandering, SCOTUS power grabbing, citizens united, vote suppression, and if necessary a scrapping of democracy altogether.",peetnice,2025-03-09T18:53:42,4

"In electoral politics a ""mandate"" is generally considered to be a clear and concise victory by a larger than normal margin.   In 2008 Obama won a ""mandate"" by getting 10 million more popular votes than McCain (~8.5% lead) and more than double the electoral votes. Democrats also won 8 seats in the Senate and 21 seats in the House, which strongly indicated that voters preferred Obama's policies over whatever the Republicans were running on. That overwhelming (in this day age) support indicates a ""mandate.""  Trump beat Kamala by about 1.6 million votes (~1.5% lead) and 86 electoral votes (~10% lead). Republicans gained 4 seats in the Senate but lost two seats in the House. This shows that support for Trump and his policies is/was marginal at best, so not a ""mandate.""  But the ""mandate"" stuff is just bumpers-sticker marketing anyway. Once you've won an election it doesn't really matter except that it indicates how easy it maybe to enact your agenda during the early days of your administration. However that doesn't seem to matter for Trump, because he is trying to forcing his agenda through using illegal means which gives the opposition party a lot of leverage to resist and will *hopefully* come back to bite him a little bit later on.",almightywhacko,2025-03-10T08:53:45,2

There’s also lots of data that allows us to see that the MAGA corridor of the Party is only 25 to 30% at best.

Mandates are fictitious situations that have no basis on reality.  The winner of the election is the winner no more or less.  What they choose to do after winning the election is up to the winners own risk assessment.  Complaining about there not being a mandate is silly.  Win next time.  What Trump is risking is making the second half of his term irrelevant with his actions. And those that support him are risking there own reelection in the house and senate.  The mandate argument is truly stupid.,Wermys,2025-03-09T19:57:02,1

"Mandate? Hilarious   This weekend I spent some time looking at all the Presidential elections. The lowest share of the electoral college was 38%, JQ Adams. The highest was Washington 100% both times because no one dare run against him. Now That's a Mandate. Reagan,  FDR were in the high 90%. Bill Clinton was the last to reach 70%. The surprising thing for me was that across 60 elections the average was just that, 70%. Which shows how polarized the electorate has been in the 2000s.   If you take the spread between the worst at 38% and best at 98% the middle would be 68%. Trump's win was well short of that at 58%. And considering 30 of those electorate votes, which decided the election, were themselves decided by 0.8 - 1.5% of low turn out elections in 3 states well it doesn't get more coin flip.",PreviousAvocado9967,2025-03-12T00:18:55,1
Define “massive overwhelming support”.  Whether or not an elected official has a “mandate” is completely a matter of opinion.

"Does it really matter if it's a mandate or not?  Trump won the election because people are tired of high prices, open borders, expensive proxy wars and identity politics.   Whichever way you cut it, it was a convincing win for Trump and the Republicans. All swing states, popular vote and majorities in the house and Senate.   Trump also won because Kamala Harris was quite simply one of the most incompetent candidates ever seen for some time. Couldn't answer basic questions coherently and didn't have any substance or conviction in her policy positions. All she could say was that she grew up in the middle class and worked at McDonald's.   I personally can't understand what it is the Trump administration is doing that has got people so upset and angry. They've taken immediate action to secure the border, they're attempting to broker peace in Ukraine, they've announced tarrifs to strengthen domestic industries such as steel and aluminum manufacturing, and they're investigating fraud, abuse and wastage of taxpayer dollars.   These are all very common sense policies, and I believe that if it were anyone else but Trump making these decisions, they'd be lauded for it.",[deleted],2025-03-13T22:46:33,1

"Trump had a mandate to fix inflation (hint: inflation had already largely waned by the time of the election, but he and Vance pretended like it hadn't). Instead, he is on course to cause the highest levels of inflation in the history of the US, if course isn't corrected.  Otherwise, dude has zero mandate. If he had a true mandate, he likely wouldn't be bum rushing and abusing EOs. His whole gambit is not to make the unitary executive theory a reality in law, but to pretend it always was the law. It's the only way for him to pull this off.

"There has only been one single presidential candidate in the history of the US who received 49.8% or more of the popular vote and failed to win his election, and that was Samuel J. Tilden in 1876. And he only lost the presidency in a corrupt bargain in which the other side gave in to his party's central policy demand (the end of Reconstruction) in exchange for the presidency.  Moreover, 6 of the 17 non-Trump elections since the end of WW2 were won with a popular vote share lower than Trump's 49.8%.  (Truman in 48, Kennedy in 60, Nixon in 68, Clinton in 92 and 96, GWB in 2000).   Let's look at JFK, for example: he governed confidently and forcefully pushed forward the Civil Rights agenda. To the best of my knowledge, nobody really questioned his mandate. Trump won a higher share of the popular vote than JFK and won it by a 17 times larger margin. His margin in the EC tipping point state was also larger than JFK's. If that kind of win was good enough for JFK to   alter the fabric of American society, why shouldn't Trump have the right to implement his agenda as far as congressional majorities and the courts let him?   Imho, Trump's policy agenda should be attacked on its substance, rather than on its legitimization by the voters.",Black_XistenZ,2025-03-10T17:50:20,9

That poll had him at  53% approval with a +/- margin of 2.5%., but another CBS poll from 4 days earlier had 80% of respondents saying inflation should be a top priority and only 29% said Trump was prioritizing it a lot.  In the same poll, 77% percent answered that their incomes are not keeping up with inflation.  His numbers will tank soon enough.",kinkgirlwriter,2025-03-09T20:51:36,7

"What are your criterions for having a mandate, then? To name one example, do you think Obama had a mandate after the 2012 election? Should Obama have compromised **more** with Republicans after the nation moved to the right during his reelection and had become more Republican than it was when he came into office?    Did Biden in 2020 have a mandate, in spite of razor-tight margins in the tipping point state(s) of the EC as well as in Congress?   Imho, this whole debate over mandates is a futile exercise. With reasonably restrictive criterions, only 2 presidents over the past 40 years had any kind of mandate, so having or not having it can't be a guideline for how a president should govern because it's just too rare in this era of a tightly and bitterly divided electorate.",Black_XistenZ,2025-03-10T18:16:26,6

"Trump is the first Republican president since the 1800s to have failed to win a majority of the electorate despite three consecutive elections. He failed to win a plurality in 2 of 3 elections. His 1.5% margin was the 5th smallest in 60 presidential elections. His 58% of the electoral college was below the average share of electors across all 60 elections, actually well below the average of 70%. Trump's the first president in our lifetime to have failed to win a combination of a majority of women, majority of college educated, majority of professionals, majority of teachers, majority under age 65, majority of Hispanics,  majority of African Americans,  majority of Asians,  majority of Catholics, Muslims, Jewish, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, majority of union households (basically America)....in all three elections.

Pretty sure the pro-military crowd would prefer if US defense contractors were not turned into a sudden liability to all US allies.   Threatening to annex Canada doesn't seem like a gop priority I ever heard of.   Trump's agenda is to be vindictive and cruel, especially to those who don't pay him proper adulation and worship.  If that's the party agenda, nuking the west coast would be well in line with it.   And given the gop seem to have abandoned any principles other than the worship of said spiteful cur, I don't see any reason why they'd stand up to him.

"All Trump and conservative media talked about, spreading complete disinformation and lies about, was inflation. That was the number one concern of voters and they were in fact too stupid to vote rationally on that issue. Again, conservative media and Trump were able to misinform the public on what actually caused inflation.  If you reread my last comment, I held your hand and explained your demonstrably poor logic and incorrect details make your original position incorrect in numerous ways that we can now see you can't logically refute. This idea that voters rejected the Democratic party platform, that they don't even know what it is, does not logically follow. Nor is the economic hardships that motivated people to instinctually vote for the Republican party proof that Trump's fascist agenda has a mandate.   People voted on the economy and they were too stupid to properly attribute it to its actual causes. Fox News gets sued for spreading terrorism causing election fraud lies to try to steal a presidential election and you all still blindly believe whatever they tell you. An important note is that conservatives and Trump supporters were also too stupid to know what actually caused the booming economy Trump inherited from Obama. Trump and right wing media lied 24/7, attributing Obama's booming economy Trump inherited to Trump. Trump was not an economic genius, just a con man taking credit for other people's work because he knew the public was too stupid to fact check his claims to it.   Thinking Fox News is a credible source causes you all to believe and feel so many irrational and immoral things. Fox News can be replaced with any bad faith conservative information source, which is most of them.",ElHumanist,2025-03-09T20:52:59,8

"You are incorrect, Biden *was* responsible for inflation. Firstly his support for Ukraine to join NATO caused a war that took one of the world's biggest producers of wheat off the market - driving global food prices up. Secondly he sanctioned the world's biggest producer of wheat (Russia) and one of the world's biggest producers of fertiliser (Belarus), again driving world food prices up. Thirdly he blew up Germany's pipeline skyrocketing world energy prices. Fourthly, he added to the debt and engaged in quantitative easing which directly causes domestic inflation. Fifthly, he added to government and business bureaucracy with DEI demands that increased costs. Don't forget he also left billions worth of equipment in Afghanistan which the taxpayer had to replace. Basically Biden is not only responsible for US inflation but global inflation.  You want to blame COVID, but wasn't Biden claiming great employment figures when actually that was just people getting jobs again after COVID? If he's going to use COVID to his advantage then he also had to accept the fallout.   In the end none of it even matters - Biden was President for 4 years and everyone got poorer (except big energy, big food, big defense, and BlackRock).
