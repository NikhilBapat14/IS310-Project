"This will be an interesting case. There has been an incremental evolution of Establishment Clause jurisprudence and several recent holdings that categorical exclusion of religious organizations from neutral programs based on religious status alone is a violation of Free Exercise.  The critical differences in this case compared to precedents like Trinity Lutheran, Espinoza, and Carson are that:  (1) the funding isn’t truly incidental to private choice. Unlike prior cases involving Pell Grants and private school tuition assistance, charter schools aren’t truly subject to private choice. While they are usually allocated funds on a per-student basis (and this will likely be presented as analogous to a student choosing where to spend their Pell Grants) it’s not really the same. They are awarded a charter and become one of the available public schools in their area - there isn’t a truly free private choice in public education.   (2) there is significant risk of entanglement with religious activities and instruction. On its face, even as a committed atheist, I would argue that the state publicly funding religious schools of multiple faiths is not expressly endorsing any religious activity. However, these contracts are competitive, allowing for operational biases and intense lobbying that could cause major risks of public entanglement with certain religious organizations and sects. Preemptive categorical exclusion may be warranted to avoid a situation where only one type of religious school gets state funding.  If regulations were narrowly tailored so that participation in religious instruction or activities were not mandatory for students of these schools, that could be an interesting situation. However, it’s not what St Isidore is proposing and not a part of their legal strategy.",atxlrj,2025-04-30T12:09:26,3
