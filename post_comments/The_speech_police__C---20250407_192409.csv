"> The FCC's general shift away from regulating news content made it surprising that the news distortion policy survived, Raphael wrote. ""Given this deregulatory trend, it is remarkable that the Commission has preserved its little-known rules against licensees' deliberately distorting the news...  Right! It comes up now, with Trump in power and working towards being a dictator, constantly bashing and threatening Reporters and News Agencies.  While, previously, Fox News lost in court and admitted they , lied.  This is #6 on the list of Laurence W. Britt's list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism:  ""A controlled mass media""",Florida_AmericasWang,2025-04-07T19:57:59,1
"> “While we understand the concerns that motivate the complaint, we nonetheless fear that an adverse ruling against CBS would constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs,” the letter said. The letter argued that “Democrats and leftwing activist groups have repeatedly worked to weaponize” the government against free speech and that the FCC should “help guard against future abuses by Democrats and leftwing organizations by streamlining license renewals and merger reviews and eliminating the news distortion and news hoax rules.”  This is complete BS. Democrats have *not* weaponized the government against free speech, and I refuse to pretend that it has!  Have a few people on the left advocated for it? Yes, but then we read the first amendment and back down. Only Republicans have actually gone through with it!",pm_me_ur_ephemerides,2025-04-07T21:01:33,1
