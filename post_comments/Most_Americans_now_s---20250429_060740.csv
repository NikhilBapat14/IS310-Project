"My fear is that people don't see these words as redundant.  That is, it SHOULD mean the same thing for them to see him as a dictator. ""dangerous"" should be implied.  However, I think we got here because people get frustrated with the slowness and degree of compromise involved in democracy. They think that's a bad thing because they imagine there are such things as ""efficient democracies"" or ""not-dangerous dictators"". So the appeal of a dictator comes when he promises to skip past bureaucracy to things they want, like jobs or food or whatever.  Benevolent dictatorship might indeed be nice, if we could all agree on what counted as benevolent, but there can be no such thing. It is not a stable quantity in nature, both because power tends to corrupt (does anyone even still remember ""won't be a dictator ... except or day one""?) and also because a benevolent dictator is too easily replaced by a malevolent one, so it's just not safe to centralize power that way. Honestly, I won't be surprised if we later look back on Trump as (comparatively only) benevolent compared to what comes next after him if we don't turn this around quickly before it's too late.  See also my recent blog essay [Government is not a Business](https://netsettlement.blogspot.com/2025/04/government-is-not-business.html) for further remarks on why inefficiency in government is not a bad thing.",netsettler,2025-04-29T08:38:24,3

Most nonvoters are satisfied with having not voted (which is concerning imo), but 92% of Trump voters apparently do not regret their decision, which should say just about everything that needs to be said about them at this point imo.   (Methodology says that the survey ran from February 28th to March 20th, 2025, so they had plenty of time to regret their vote - they just don't regret it, or it hadn't sunk in just yet.

"I came from within the Right-wing church/Republicans back in the 80s as a teen.  Old-school Reagan crazy.     My first indication (and step out of) was the entire Iran Contra trial.  I was fascinated by the speech given by Oliver North about being patriotic and I had an older cousin I was hanging out with that provided me a book about the whole thing and asked me to look at other parts of the trial outside of the speech.  Rush Limbaugh really only talked about how patriotic Reagan and Oliver North were and really avoided all the other facts, once I started looking a bit deeper I started to realize just how groomed their storylines were and how much information they avoided providing.  When I asked my parents they were very upset I was looking deeper into this stuff and just like when the Church gets annoyed that you need the ""Holy Ghost"" to truly understand the Bible they work hard to stop you from looking around.  That's the entire Right-wing strategy.  Keep you as low-informed and mis-informed as possible because the biggest way out of that bubble is actually learning about reality.  And the problem is they teach their children this tiny world and introduce them to youth pastors that have an insanely high incidence of grooming/sexual assault while explaining that it's the gays that are the groomers.  Leaving the bubble while under the roof of these parents is downright dangerous so they generally have to wait until they leave the house and even then will probably be disowned by most of their family if they show doubt in Republicans/the Church.

Turned out that he got most of his news and info from Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and a few other right wing lunatics. So, the reason I hadn't heard of these things that he was talking about was that, by and large, those things weren't real. They were outright lies or gross exaggerations and mischaracterizations that were crafted solely to push a narrative for conservative Rebublicans and their political agenda. My friend was ruled by fear, paranoia and a victim complex that was fed to him by the media that he consumed. Back then they didn't scream about fake news, they raged against the ""liberal media"".

"What you haven’t acknowledged is that there IS a voting bloc of the country that she would have lost by pivoting away from Biden, and her calculus was that that bloc was larger than whatever bloc she lost from the left. And the data suggest she is right. Her low turnout was largely in states that didn’t matter. In 3 or 4/7 swing states she exceeded Biden’s numbers and still lost the state. In the remainder, she could have matched Biden’s numbers and still lost. The only state there is an argument for Gaza mattering is Michigan, where Harris would have won had she simply matched Biden’s numbers and won all of Stein’s voters. As you said, the left is absolutely insignificant nationwide. Her problem was not Gaza, it was being unable to motivate low-motivation voters the way Trump does. Because the left is an insignificant low-motivation electorate even with progressive candidates in much of the Midwest and south, I don’t think pivoting in Gaza would have netted more votes where it mattered.   She definitely COULD have tried to cut herself off from Biden more, but the stink was on her from the start. She was the Vice President, after all. She would have needed to resign and remake her whole image in 100 days, and that would have been an even taller task than the insurmountable one she faced. Remember, she was unpopular from the start.

The actual outcome was consistent with these predictions. That said, a wide range outcomes—anything from 55–45 to 45–55—would have jibed with some of these forecasts.

The top 0.1% — whose annual average income exceeds $14 million — would pay about $167,000 more in taxes.  ---   > She also says she wants to provide a financial cushion for small businesses with a tenfold increase in the startup expense deduction — lifting it from $5,000 to $50,000. New businesses wouldn't need to claim the deduction in their first year, when many take losses and would not be able to use it. Instead, they'd be able to wait until they're profitable and use the deduction at that time. Businesses would also be able to take part of the deduction in one year and save the rest for future years.  ---  > After Trump's running mate JD Vance pitched boosting the child tax credit to $5,000, up from the current top tax break of $2,000, Harris one-upped Vance's number, suggesting a child tax credit of $6,000, although this would be for the parents of newborns.   > Harris also suggests a return to the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit, up to $3,600 for young children. She hasn't released income eligibility thresholds, but it's likely that it would phase out for those at higher income levels.  ---  > Harris says she'd address the nation's housing shortage with several initiatives. She promises to build 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax breaks to builders who construct homes for first-time home buyers. She's also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the low housing stock.   > And she wants to provide Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners.   ----  > Harris is trying to address the effects of inflation on lower- and middle-class Americans, an approach used by the Biden administration. She blames price gouging by food suppliers and grocery chains for high prices at the store and pledges to take on corporations with the first federal law against price gouging. Economists have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a law because they say that the reasons for food inflation are complex.   > She also wants to lower prescription drug costs, which has been a focus for the Biden administration. Last month, the White House announced Medicare reached agreements with drug manufacturers for lower prices for 10 drugs that treat a range of ailments, from heart failure and blood clots to diabetes, resulting in savings for patients of 38% to 79%, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

">You don’t disarm rage with rage.  Yes, absolutely. ""Rage"" conveys a sense of mindlessness to it.  I also don't want people to misunderstand and think I'm saying that the emotion of 'anger' is wrong somehow. I do think that anger has its place and is not a sin. ""Righteous anger,"" even, is something overused (to death) by the Abrahamic religions (particularly Christianity and Islam), but ... it's not nothing, either. Our species evolved anger for a reason, and sometimes it is appropriate. Righteous anger gave us The New Deal and whatever degree of balance and stability the world enjoyed in the few decades after WWII in which people were still bearing the bruises.  Similarly, an inability to get worked up about anything (nihilism) is a bad idea, too. It leads to both-sidesism and default acceptance of any and all situations.  So, I do think that it's possible for anger to have a place. It's just ... not the only thing, and we shouldn't think of it as the ""way out."" It's more like the spark of ignition to get a combustion engine running. If you let that fire run out of control, it burns down the vehicle. Maybe explodes it, even.  So, we can't let anger do our thinking for us, to the point that we want to satisfy the hunger of our rage more than we want to fix the thing that caused it in the first point. Recognizing that it's appropriate and letting ourselves feel it a bit, though, may be necessary to keep motivation up in the grueling years to come. :-(",Lurlex,2025-04-29T12:43:34,7

"Unfortunately, at least anecdotally, that democrat does exist. The country isn’t nearly as progressive as we want to believe, not right now, not with our broken society and education systems.   You don’t have to compromise on genocide. But this is the result. You don’t have to change to recognize the results of your actions. Unfortunately life isn’t fair.  But yes, unfortunately, if Harris outright said “I will hold Israel accountable for the genocide if Palestinians, she would have lost a portion of the pro-Israel democratic base that does exist. If she came out in favor of Medicare for all, she would have been framed as a spooky “socialist” and lost both center-right Dems and pushed more low-information/motivation voters toward Trump. His best ad was the “Kamala is for they/them, Trump is for you” ad that wasn’t even rooted in reality.   We have to accept we live in a country where support for things like M4A, Trans rights, and equity are seen as extreme. It’s not fair, it’s not right, but it is the country we live in.   And a chief failure of the Democrats IS that they’ve not succeeded in improving education, instead being content to make marginal strides in top of whatever new low the Republicans drag us to, so everyone loses. That they’ve failed to provide real results to people in economic hardship through America, instead choosing to insist that the hardship is temporary, or relative to some worse-off group, insignificant. Those aren’t effective policy positions.  So, yes, I think Harris and the Dems at large were mostly responsible for their failure, and that that failure was two decades and a Biden presidency in the making.   However, this does not absolve us progressives, who, because maybe we can’t compromise on genocide, a correct moral position, further wounded their reputation, convinced a great number of people that both sides really were “the same,” and pushed people towards Trump, who successfully framed Harris as the true “conservative” and himself as the “change” candidate.   We can acknowledge the failures of the Democrats,  acknowledge our own lack of pragmatism, since indeed not compromising on genocide in the end made life worse for those we sought to aid, and acknowledge that going forward a working-class-first party, likely a refocused Democratic Party once this “civil war” is won, is the only way forward.   We must reject divisions that segregate the working class, and stand for policies that help all, including the white rural/working class Americans that have abandoned the Dems, believing them to prefer targeted aid that omits them (true or not). We must embrace populism, and be universal about it. Importantly, Harris could not do this, because the Democratic Party as it stands today is owned by corporate interests. It can’t be going forward, but that doesn’t change the realities of 2024.  And what’s scary is, even if that happens, I don’t know if we’ll have the political capital to make the moves on Israel (the nation) that are necessary to end the genocide. There are some things that are awful and that can’t practically be changed if we want to actually help people at home. And if we say we want to help Palestinians over Americans, we will lose every single election to a demagogue like Trump. We must make conditions at home so good that people feel they have the bandwidth to help others.

"This is what he actually said about the ""waste of time"":  >This sounds appealingly precise (for example, ""The proportion is between 68.5 percent and 71.5 percent""), but it is generally a waste of time because public opinion varies enough from day to day that it is meaningless to attempt too precise an estimate.

The electoral college is stupid.",beatleboy07,2025-04-29T21:23:31,2
