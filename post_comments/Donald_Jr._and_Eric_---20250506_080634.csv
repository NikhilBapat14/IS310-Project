"A so-called trust run by your children cued by daddy's political machinations is as corrupt and unethical as it could possibly be. Emoluments Clause, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, years of lawsuits, another impeachment at least, this is the Idiot Trump family future.",YallerDawg,2025-05-06T08:37:34,16

Meanwhile... Trump's sons have been directed to make sure Trump makes as much money as possible.   Wonder how much of the discussions are related to trade/tariffs for those who do deals with his family ü§î,Lebarican22,2025-05-06T08:07:30,6

"Hell, even without reading the article this is a huge ""no shit"".  That is their entire m.o. from start to finish.  Period.   Honestly, the only surprising thing would be if they weren't trying to enrich Trump (and themselves).",crucial_geek,2025-05-06T09:22:56,5

"""The White House has said there are no ethics issues because Mr. Trump‚Äôs sons run the businesses. ‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs assets are in a trust managed by his children,‚Äù Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said. ‚ÄúThere are no conflicts of interest.‚Äù  But Mr. Trump‚Äôs¬†financial disclosure report,¬†which he is legally required to file, shows that he still personally benefits financially from most of these ventures.  Eric Trump noted that many of the ventures they are promoting ‚Äî from crypto to real estate ‚Äî were underway before their father was re-elected. ‚ÄúWe are building the most iconic projects on earth and leading the way in the digital revolution,‚Äù Eric Trump said in a statement to The New York Times.""",Lebarican22,2025-05-06T08:08:35,3
