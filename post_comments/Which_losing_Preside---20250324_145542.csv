"Maybe a hot take, but I’m going to go with McGovern in ‘72 as the most consequential, and barring total disaster, his victory would have radically reshaped all of the national politics that followed for the better in too many ways to list right now.",Unlikely-Ad-431,2025-03-25T09:44:05,145

Mitt Romney: would have likely taken the wind out of the sails of the far right. Covid would have probably been managed better and he would probably have been remembered as a near great president but always having the asterisk of making Obama a one term president   Gore: A Gore presidency likely means no Iraq and a liberal Supreme Court and earlier action on climate change   Mondale: Not successful but crushing the Reagan Revolution in its cradle would have led to a wildly different political scene  Whoever said McGovern 1972 is right though. Defeating Nixon at the ballot box and then revealing his corruption to the public would have been wild. The Rockefeller Republicans and the George Romney’s of the world might have become the dominant faction in the GOP,elykl12,2025-03-25T10:08:52,63

"Hillary Clinton and Al gore are the most obvious ones. Either would have been like a history making president but in a good way. I don’t imagine gore would have invaded Iraq and gotten us into that morass.   Hillary would have handled covid so much better and not done any of the nonsense trump did.

"I was going to readily say Gore, but then I thought one major variable here is if Congressional elections remained the same. Gore would have had his work cut out for him working with a hostile House.   In that sense, you could argue Dole, Romney or Dukakis would have had a better term.   That said, Gore was probably the strongest all around politician. He had a ready agenda, was from a southern state, had a good record of bipartisanship, and was well versed in both domestic and foreign policy. And if not for the hanging chads, he WOULD have been president.   So, he already was the most successful of the ‘losers’, which should say he was set to be pretty successful had he won.  It’s easy to imagine a Gore presidency actually, because it arguably SHOULD have happened, everything else remaining equal. And these days it sure is fun to imagine one.",Magnet_Lab,2025-03-25T06:26:15,22
"I think success is a bit of a hard thing to pin. Success in terms of general success in the history books - I think depends on what side of those policy issues you land on.   Success in terms of passing elements of their agenda? Obviously hard to isolate - but assuming in the hypothetical where everything else was exactly the same apart from the presidential race - I'd probably say Dukakis or Dole - just given that, as opposed to all of the other Presidential 'losers' - their races were the few in recent history where their party retained control (though very thin) of both the House and the Senate despite losing the Presidency - and thus would have had a Congress more willing to work towards their agendas. Though again, very thin majorities (both with both a House and Senate within 3 or 4 seat majorities).",PhiloPhocion,2025-03-25T09:39:10,7

Hillary Clinton and Al Gore would've been significantly more successful then Bush and Trump,[deleted],2025-03-25T12:51:41,7
"Not necessarily in terms of quality, but in terms of opportunity and potential for altering history, I would say Al Gore.  Could argue a lot of things would have been better without George W., but three major things I think you could argue would have been enough to change American history:  1. No Invasion of Iraq.  Afghanistan probably still happens, but the whole world was behind us there.  It was Iraq where we began to lose the world and ourselves.  Iraq is a humanitarian disaster, it strengthens Iran, leads to ISIS, and pulls our focus away from Afghanistan which with more focus and investment might have been a winnable war.  Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives and thousands of American lives saved. Plus estimates are it will have cost anywhere from 1-3 Trillion Dollars in total.  Imagine that being reinvested in the United States or at least not added to the deficit.  This is the big one for me.  I could argue this leads to the collapse of the Republican establishment and the eventual rise of Trump.  And for those who would say it would have happened anyway because the Democrats voted for it, I think if you read the history of the leadup to that war it is very clear that the Bush administration had to put in two years of effort to create a rationale for that war, against the views of the military and defense establishment, and lied to sell it to the public.  It's shameful that the Democrats went along with it, but it  wasn't just an organic response to 9/11 that was inevitable. 2. Climate change is dealt with far earlier. 3. Social Security is put in a ""locked box"" with far more lead time to survive demographic changes and remain solvent.",MattVideoHD,2025-03-25T10:45:35,6

"If we measure success compared to the alternative of who actually won, Clinton and Harris both have pretty good claims. I'm going to go ahead and say Al Gore also has a strong claim simply because he probably wouldn't have started the Iraq war.   I guess I'm sounding pretty negative about modern Republicans.

i think all the current problems in the united states can be blamed on the outcome of the 1988 presidential election. Dukakis wins in 88 there is no Bush political dynasty. There is also no bill and hillary clinton. Bob dole would have been the republican nominee in 92. if he was like he was in 96 then he would have lost. There would be no clarence thomas on the supreme court. Thurgood Marshall would have retired in the first month of a Michael Dukakis presidency. Odds are Mccain would have ran for president in 1996 and odds are he would have won.

He would have taken a stronger political stance earlier on in WWI undoubtedly involving the US much earlier if he could get Congress to play ball (and with his moxie I can't imagine they would not) which could mean a dramatically different geopolitical outcome than the current one. More than that one of the things he was discussing at the time was creating a single payer health care system, can you imagine how much better off the US would be? Plus, if WW1 had been shorter it is possible the global economic situation that led to the great Depression may not have occurred, the Russian Empire may not have fallen, or at least not in the way it did meaning it could have been possible to prevent a Bolshevik take over and avoid the cold war, plus if the US had played a more prominent role (and had strong man Teddy at the table) we likely would have had a stronger role in peace talks which means it is possible we could have created a more equitable peace agreement which, in tandem with avoiding the post war economic boom and subsequent crash, could likely mean very different conditions in Germany and Italy, which could very well mean no WW2.",gabrielolsen13,2025-03-25T21:36:04,1

Again we'll never know but I don't think it ultimately would've shifted the underlying issues of how people get and spread information - and with that, how they perceive the world they're in.   By the 2012 election, the Tea Party performed less well than in 2010 but still obviously had major influence and I think by then, was clearly already being actively incorporated into the party than fought the way it was when it was first gaining ground.   But also the post-mortem on Romney's loss was that the party had gone too extreme on social issues for the base and that it would benefit them to moderate - and yet 4 years later, the exact opposite was true - which to me indicates that the drift on a more hardline stance was already brewing.   The rise of openly partisan and often disconnected from reality news, especially via Fox's growth, and the unchecked spread of misinformation and disinformation online I think would've happened regardless and would've ultimately pulled on some of the same issues we're having today globally. Whether Romney winning would've delayed or expedited that - or whether it would've been Trump or someone else I can't say obviously - but I don't think we'd be in a much better place.",PhiloPhocion,2025-03-25T09:26:27,11

"Absolutely.  The whole political landscape would be in a much better place, but Obama ran such a dirty campaign in 2012 that we may never recover from it.  I think this quote from his campaign manager says it all:  >“My favorite political philosopher is Mike Tyson,” Messina says. “Mike Tyson once said everyone has a plan until you punch them in the face. Then they don’t have a plan anymore. [The Republicans] may have a plan to beat my guy. My job is to punch them in the face.”  https://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/balz-pens-searing-indictment-of-2012-095191  So campaigns now barely address the issue anymore and are mostly about punching the opposition in the face with anything possible.  Romney was a boy scout of a politician, but the Obama campaign made him out to be an animal abusing racist with binders full of women.  Well congratulations it worked and you got yourself a second term that was mostly a lame duck, but was it worth the cost?  If you make someone like Romney out to be no better than Trump, then you have just paved the road for a President Trump.    Think we might could learn that lesson and deescalate some, but no Biden was in a much worse spot than Obama was in for reelection and took that tactic to a whole new level.  They try to make Trump out to be a super serious Nazi Hitler out to destroy Democracy.  Of course that makes the ploy too obvious except for the extreme wackos who would go so far as assassination attempts.  Couldn’t have possibly backfired any worse, but I doubt politicians learned any lessons from it.  They will continue down this path stoking up division and enmity for half the populace who simply disagrees.

"The news agency recounts after the fact showed that it really depended on the disposition of the over-votes (votes for more than one candidate) as well as undervotes (how much of the punch had to be punched out to be a valid vote). ""Hanging chads"" being counted actually pushed the vote further in Bush's favor.  What really changes the outcome is the statewide recount vs specific counties. The Gore campaign asked for recounts of specific counties, and if those were completed, Bush would have won by 225 votes. If Florida had done a complete recount of every county using what was called the ""prevailing standard"" (which was never done) Gore would have won by 60 votes. If a statewide recount was done (again, never ordered, and not what Gore asked for) and every county determined on their own what was a valid vote or not, Gore would have won by 171.

Everyone else was running on how great and noble the war on terror had been.  Also the GOP leadership didn’t pick Trump in 2016, they tried their hardest to keep him out, they only grudgingly came along when he handily defeated all of their preferred candidates in the primaries.

"There's a wiki page for the recounts (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida), including the ones that happened and were ongoing, so the idea that ""there were no recounts"" isn't accurate. In particular, Florida law requires machine recounts due to the closeness of the vote (although some counties didn't actually do it, most counties did). So the ""recount"" scenarios are actually second recounts, done manually. I'd prefer you to the wiki page for more on that, because there are a bunch of scenarios between what actually happened, what was ordered by various courts, and what different legs found after the fact.   If by ""pre-vote tallies"" you mean the exit polls, networks called Florida for Gore, then Bush, then back to too close to call. The initial count showed Bush won by under 2000 votes, and after the fact recounts under different scenarios range from ""Gore won by 170"" to ""Bush won by 500.""  I've compared it before to a football game where replay shows Gore didn't cross the goal line as time expired on the final drive, but there was a Bush turnover earlier in the game that Gore didn't challenge.  >the person in charge of Florida voting was part of Bushs campaign,  You mean Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris? She wasn't part of the Bush campaign to the best of my memory, and I don't see anything on a Google search that says that's the case. Can you point me at a link?

Rolls purging and whatnot happened, but it doesn't follow that it means SCOTUS is corrupt. That's like saying the Queen dying means Musk took over the Presidency.

"I think in the context of the financial crisis and who would have handled it better it's reasonable to say Gore would have handled it better.  Yes the glass steagall repeal and other Clinton era policies absolutely helped shape that environment but Bush's steadfast adherence to deregulation and lowering income tax even in the face of some pretty clear alarm bells prior to 2008 was what ultimately lead to such a large collapse.  Bush had 7 years to address those underlying problems.  Republicans are always very dogmatic in their economic approach (lower taxes, less regulation no matter what) Democrats are historically more willing to pivot on economics in response to developing problems since they don't really adhere to one consistent economic mantra.  This is why Republicans have presided over so much more instability in the modern era.  On the Iraq war it's more murky.  After 911 there was pretty much bipartisan support to bomb someone, somewhere in the general vicinity of the middle east.  Unless you truly believe that the intelligence failure that led to 911 was a direct result of bush governance and could've been avoided, you'd be hard pressed to argue that some sort of poorly justified war wasn't going to happen no matter who was in office.",Inevitable-Ad-9570,2025-03-25T13:59:03,3

"At no point was Bush ordering more recounts. That was Gore, and he requested several recounts in 4 specific counties that at the time were known blue strongholds. At no point in time did Gore ever lead the vote count in Florida. Bush took the issue to court because Gore was attempting to get Florida to do manual recounts where the vote counters had to use their personal judgment with respect to poorly executed ballots. If you're born in 77, then you were 23 at the time. Remember the hanging chads and butterfly ballots? I was 18 at the time, and I certainly remember them. Its why I'm skeptical about your age since you have such a poor memory of what happened. Not to mention how you got all the other events incorrect.   Bush took the issue to court because of Gore's refusal to accept that he lost Florida and his attempt to cheat the vote by trying to gain votes in only specific counties where he thought he could squeeze out a better total, while at the same time the certification deadline was looming. Gore didn't actually care about making sure every vote counted, despite what he has claimed, since he didn't bother with recounts in other close counties that were known red strongholds.
