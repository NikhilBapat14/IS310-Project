 What kind of absolute fucking lizard person would even know about those rules to want to fight against them in this day and age.   It should just be one of those vestigial laws that exists only because it would cost money to remove - so it’s just easier to ignore like how it’s illegal to have a sleeping donkey in your bathtub after 7:00pm in Arizona.   Goddamn the south has some seriously empty hate filled fucking dribbling CHUDs.,karatebullfightr,2025-05-02T20:47:06,3
