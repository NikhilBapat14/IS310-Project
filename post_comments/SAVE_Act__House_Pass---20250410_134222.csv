Call your Senators!  5 calls app: https://5calls.org/  4 Dem reps voted in favor of the SAVE ACT so it won't necessarily be split down party lines in the Senate.,undercurrents,2025-04-10T13:43:16,49
And they all seem so happy about it!! Let’s fuck over our constituents!!!,katara144,2025-04-10T14:48:28,32
I feel like this bill is going to backfire. More Republican would be effected. Democratic women are aware of this and will take precautions.,Rosebunse,2025-04-10T14:52:53,36

"This is the one that scares me so much. This stupid patriarichal GOP is going to disenfranchise millions and millions of women out of their right to vote, and they think that God is ""okay"" with it. I think they missed the part of the Bible where it says He created men and women EQUAL. EQUAL. It's so bad when Christians make other Christians wanna slap a Christian. Sigh.",Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-04-10T17:03:23,8

This is how Republicans stay in power…voter suppression and fake news.  https://preview.redd.it/8j1bp5yyx3ue1.jpeg?width=1175&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27243402763762d268ca60a21b5b3f76337a71cd,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-10T20:21:20,4
Need a mass effort to raise awareness about this and help people confirm their status / get registered / cured asap,kurdis_lumen,2025-04-10T23:07:54,3
They need 60 votes to pass this in the Senate correct?,Neon_culture79,2025-04-10T23:54:38,3
"I would be perfectly fine with Voter ID if we had a free ID that was easy to obtain available in the US. I kind of think Democrats keep harping on the wrong issue here. Yes, we do need ID to do so many other things and I honestly don’t see what’s wrong with having an ID to vote. However I do see the barrier to obtaining an ID, which can cause people issues in other areas of life. So instead of objecting to voter ID - which always gives the Republicans the counter argument of ‘why? So you can cheat?’ - lobby for a national ID program. Give more funding to DMVs to stay open on weekends and evenings and drop the cost if someone is getting an ID and not a drivers license.",brokenstrawberrie,2025-04-11T11:23:20,1
"Outside of Texas, the more populated States that currently do not require an ID --California, Oregon, Washington, most of the Northeast, Illinois, Minnesota, and a few other States are predominantly blue States.   My guess is that this is more or less to reduce the number of popular votes and to likely increase the chances of wining by electoral college.  Since 2000, the GOP has won the Presidency twice by losing the popular vote, and I would bet that this has more to do with tilting the playin field, much like gerrymandering, than it does with the 'Handmaid's Tale'.   I do agree that this is voter suppression, though, I just see this as being targeted directly at blue States more so on than being some sort of patriarchal Christianity or whatever.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T14:46:39,1
I have my name change court documents. Do y'all think having that with my birth certificate will be enough if I'm purged from the voter rolls? I tried to have my birth certificate updated but couldn't reach anyone and I would rather not have to pay to update my passport.,Adventurous-Case6436,2025-04-11T20:09:13,1

Which would be nice but I wouldn't wager on that. Especially compounded with all the other things they are doing.,CyberneticMushroom,2025-04-10T15:56:10,15
"Depends on your perspective.  They only need 51 votes to pass the Senate.  But, they need 60 votes initially (before the actual vote) to move it out of debate.  As long as enough Dems hold out, it can be filibustered to infinity until it dies, gets tabled until another day, or possibly amended.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T14:24:57,2
"Yeah, and I doubt seven Democrats will vote for this, but what do I know? If four Representatives were able to spit in the faces of their constituents, then what's to say Senators wouldn't, too?",JustAnotherFag69,2025-04-11T06:36:59,1
"The main argument is that not everyone will have an ID but are otherwise legal citizens with a right to vote.    But, one thing that doesn't seem to come up is that you can only vote once.  So, if someone went to a voting center and said they were me, ""I"" can only vote the one time.  Technically, this same person can vote twice, assuming their actual voting station is an another location, and they go and vote there, too, but then if I go later in the day and try to vote, I can't because my name is already crossed off.  I say this as someone who lives in Republican and MAGA heavy area, and they have never even asked for a voter registration card.  All we do is tell them our name.   Earlier in life I did live somewhere where you had to show the voter registration card, an ID, or some other form of proof that your name, address, etc. matches.  I don't recall there ever being an issue.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T14:34:11,1

"This will be unpopular around here, but I think this is a wager worth taking.  There are simply more left-leaning women who are likely to have the necessary documents and / or more likely to have kept their own last names than there are on the right.  There are also likely a lot more never-married women on the left.    The questions become, then:    1.  Are these numbers greater than the number of Dem voters who would not be able to register?  2.  Are the numbers of affected Republicans smaller than the number of affected Dems, overall.   My guess is that this really an attempt to suppress black and women votes, which are largely Dem to begin with, in particular because they already know their chances of at least keeping the House in 2026 is already slim.   But the reason why I say to go for it is because if there is a blue wave in 2026, and if a Dem wins in 2028, they have even less ground to stand on in terms of fake / illegal votes.    In other words, I think this is a game that we can beat them at considering that we have just over a year to ensure those in need get the proper documentation in order for the mid-terms and just over 3 1/2 for 2028.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T14:19:36,1
"OK, that’s exactly what I thought. I just wanted to confirm. I hope other people see this confirmation and understand better.",Neon_culture79,2025-04-11T14:46:42,1
Also some men too. Who takes on their partner's name. Also married couples with hyphenated names. Like John Smith Jones and Jane Smith Jones.,OhioRanger_1803,2025-04-11T07:58:38,3

"Yeah, the language is bit wonky --they need 60 votes for cloture (to end debate) but only need a simply majority to pass the bill, which is the actual vote. So some people tend to focus on the 'needed votes' part and miss the step before.    Amending the Constitution is the only one off the top of my head that requires the smaller number first and the larger number second to make it happen.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T18:58:00,1
