It’s almost like picking an elderly man with cancer for House Democratic Leadership over a younger progressive was a bad idea…,No_Biscotti_7110,2025-04-29T10:30:40,23
And now how will Pelosi once again screw AOC or any other potential progressive?  I loathe that fucking woman.,Physical-Ad-3798,2025-04-29T10:29:10,20
">Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia), a longtime liberal voice representing Northern Virginia, said Monday that he would not be seeking reelection next year and would step down from his role as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee after his esophageal cancer returned.  >Connolly, 75, had announced his diagnosis last fall, just days after winning reelection to a ninth term representing the state’s 11th Congressional District, which covers much of Fairfax County.  >But “we’ve learned that the cancer, while initially beaten back, has now returned,” he wrote in an email to constituents. “The sun is setting on my time in public service, and this will be my last term in Congress.”  >Connolly said he would also be stepping back “soon” from his spot as the Oversight Committee’s ranking member. He had fought [a fierce intraparty battle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-oversight-ranking-member/) for that role just a few months ago in what was an early preview of a rift in recent months between longtime representatives and younger Democrats over the party’s direction.  >A spokesperson for his office did not clarify on Monday when he would be stepping aside.Connolly leveraged his role on the Oversight panel to advocate for the thousands of federal employees who live in the Washington region, whose cause he championed long before that workforce was targeted by the Trump administration’s massive layoffs and spending cuts.  > “He looked after federal employees and contractors when no one else was paying attention,” said former congressman Tom Davis (R-Virginia), a former Oversight Committee chairman who climbed the ranks of elected office in Fairfax alongside Connolly and befriended him from across the aisle. “The region is going to lose a powerful voice in a key position.”  >Some younger, more liberal Democrats had criticized his decision to seek the ranking member post in December, but Connolly’s supporters cited his long record of accomplishments on Capitol Hill — including postal reform, Metro funding and the modernization of federal IT systems — as examples of his qualifications for the role.",cynognathus,2025-04-29T10:19:19,3

Maybe AOC isn't as good at being a legislator as she is at being a rally host? Maybe seniority and connections has more value in some roles than others. Maybe you just hate Pelosi because you've been fed a stream of propaganda for the past 14 years?  The personality cults y'all create are gross.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-29T10:35:11,-30

It isn’t a coincidence that most of the media hit pieces on AOC and “the squad” stopped when Pelosi lost the speakership.,Bad_Pirate829,2025-04-29T10:48:27,15
I understand what you’re saying. You’re saying don’t blame pelosi and establishment dems for holding progressives below water. Blame the progressives for not being able to swim to the surface. Smart! What a clever angle. By taking that approach it puts all the onus and focus on the progressives and removes any accountability for those at the top of the democratic party who make and change the rules as they see fit.,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-29T10:57:16,11
"They stopped when Democrats lost the house. The majority of the Pelosi hit pieces stopped, too. There's no Pelosi conspiracy there no matter how much you want there to be.  You're being played.  As far as ""the squad"" goes.. as far as I'm concerned Tlaib revealed how shallow their motivations really are. Zero interest in governing for the  good of the American people.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-29T11:26:58,-6
"I'm saying clinging to 3 or four names out of 250+ politicians and whining about how everything is unfair is the desired outcome from years of propaganda and manipulation. Foreign actors _and_ Republicans have admitted to pushing cultist behavior like the Bernie Bros to achieve this outcome. Just as they tried with Ye, Yang, etc.  If you're not going to try to understand how governance and party politics actually works, at least go watch _The Distinguished Gentleman_ and use satire as a proxy.  Leave the persecution complex for the conservatives.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-29T11:30:32,-5
"I’m not saying anything was a conspiracy, it happened in the open. It’s pretty factual that the moderates of the DNC use their media access and fundraising power to silence the left wing of the party.",Bad_Pirate829,2025-04-29T11:35:21,9
"Yeah. Don't blame the insider trading corporate prostitutes (no offense to sex workers) who lost TWO elections to a fascist orange cartoon character.   Just fill your $20,000 freezer with $15/pint ice cream and plan how your going to campaign for a greasy haired PG&E puppet to lose the next election. Assuming there even IS one.",ford7885,2025-04-29T11:42:55,8
Fact: DNC allowed AIPAC - a right wing group- to spend over 100 million in the primary election to defeat progressive candidates.  Feelings: what you have.  edit: https://www.kget.com/hill-politics/pro-israel-groups-target-progressive-lawmakers-in-primaries/amp/,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-29T11:41:00,4
"Do you understand the concept of a leadership role? Party leaders fumbled bad. There needs to be some accountability. ""Nothing will fundamentally change"" did not save us. There needs to be some plan other than continuing to place empty suits in charge of collecting bribes until people are starving and the country fully collapses.",seriousofficialname,2025-04-29T16:06:35,3
