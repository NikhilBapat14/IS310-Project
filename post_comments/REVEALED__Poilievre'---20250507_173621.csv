Choke artist. Pierre Poilievre didn't rise to the moment.,Highwiind-D4,2025-05-07T17:51:18,193
What an idiot. “Conservatives” who let the media dictate the narrative and weakly play defense deserve the losses they set themselves up for.,dunkeater,2025-05-07T17:40:29,125
"Canadian here, I get why he refused. 1. The people who listen to Joe Rogan are already voting conservative and 2. the crowd he needed to win, the MSM brainwashed boomers and the Quebecers, would have seen that as more proof he was ''Trump 2.0'' (the incredibly moronic narrative the Libs successfully pushed). At best he would have performed the same. At worst it would have tanked him.   Look at Maxime Bernier, who went on Tucker Carlson, and had his shittiest performance ever, by far. Canadian and American politics are VERY different.",winterbike,2025-05-07T19:42:55,84
"Honestly was probably the right call, he got the strongest vote share and turnout for the  Conservatives in decades. The voters who swung the election were the NDP (hard left) and Bloc (Quebec seperatists) who all strategically voted Liberal to keep the Conservatives out of office - those weren't voters who would have been swayed by Joe Rogan.",ajmeko,2025-05-07T22:55:46,14

"Pierre Poilievre is one of the greatest political failures in the history of mankind. This guy HAD. IT. WON. All he had to do was make it 8 more weeks. He couldn’t do it. If they run him again next time, they are idiots.",VerusPatriota,2025-05-08T02:04:41,3
"lol PP is regarded and trash.  I felt a little bad for him, but nah he don't deserve the crown.     Sorry Canada, you got some weak AF leaders.",murderinthedark,2025-05-07T18:49:11,-8
So did Kamaladingdong. Both lost. Rogan 2-0 in elections babaaay.,Frankenberg91,2025-05-07T20:23:59,-8
"Do-nothing conservatism, Canada edition.  One team's whole job is to pass the ball to the other team, then when the team that caught the passed ball starts gutting the other side's fans they will say the game was perfectly fair and the gutted fans deserve everything they get - *all over again.*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T17:58:45,77
"What, ""mass migration but on a slightly delayed schedule"" isn't an inspiring campaign plank in the middle of an international referendum on migration?",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-07T20:19:10,23

">The people who listen to Joe Rogan are already voting conservative  This is the spin that gets put on the podcast by people that don't listen or selectively listen (not you specifically, but the media).  While he probably has a much more conservative audience than a podcast like ""Smartless,"" you can go to his subreddit and see this is very much not the case.    Additionally, there's a difference between conservatives and conservative voters (which is where Trump excelled).  I'll concede the point you made below about him receiving the highest conservative vote ever, but that's looking in hindsight.",BryanFnR,2025-05-08T07:34:30,3
"I absolutely cannot understand this.  Joe Rogan has **the biggest podcast audience in the world**. There are plenty of people within that will organically spread the message, via sharing or clips, that would reach *millions* more people far beyond Canada's borders. Damn near everyone watches Rogan or knows who he is.  If Quebecers and ""MSM brainwashed Boomers"" would have reacted as ""Trump 2.0"", **they never would have been convinced in the first place**. Polliviere had a chance to use this to show people in the middle and shallow left that he's simply *himself*, in an unfiltered interview. Trump did the same thing and the Independent vote practically magnetized to him.  If anything, this proves to me that Canada is pretty much done. It has gone so far left that even supposed ""Conservatives"" reject using one of the largest platforms on Earth to clarify and explain positions, for fear of looking like their closest ally's leader. That's just pure stupidity.  TDS drives Canadian politics and it will be the reason Canada is never prosperous.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-08T06:43:55,6
Agreed. Anyone here who is shitting on Poilievre for this decision doesn't understand Canadian politics and therefore should refrain from commenting on this subject.,HelloBello30,2025-05-08T08:16:17,0
"The Tories in the UK lost last year and the LP lost in Australia this week. Meanwhile, right-wing populist parties have been making big gains and/or winning elections outright. AfD in February and now that Romanian guy in the first found of elections this week.  The trend here is more that voters have lost their appetite for lukewarm conservatives who are basically just 5-years-late liberals. This would be like running Romney in 2024.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-07T20:22:39,25
"Controlled opposition that don't want to do anything to reverse mass immigration.  Farage, Wilders, Meloni, Sweden, it's the same story across the West.  ",Zonostros,2025-05-08T02:40:12,1
"Everything. He got the biggest conservative popular vote ever. Any other election he would have gotten a crazy majority, and he was on track for it. It took the Boomers having a massive case of MSM-induced TDS + the NDP and Greens destroying their own parties *on purpose* to stop him + the Bloc wildly underperforming for him not to win. The whole thing was crazy.",winterbike,2025-05-08T04:19:02,19
"Personally I would have liked him to go, no doubt. All I'm saying is, I also get why he chose not to.",winterbike,2025-05-08T07:47:26,2
