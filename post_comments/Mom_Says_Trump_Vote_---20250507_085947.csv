"It's ridiculous with these stories and articles. Who cares if this one person is deported? ""OMG, it's this one person I know and now I'm sad for the way I voted""  There's so many people's lives being screwed up, not just from deportations and being detained by stupid ICE. But all the federal jobs that were cut for no good reason. All the trade war garbage that's just making quality of life that much worse. All the stupid new rules on vaccines and fluoride in water. All the bs that's coming out of the administration to distract from real issues.  I'm upset so many people are being deported. I know there's some bad actors out there, but so many people are here to try to have a better life, they've tried to do the right thing and the system just keeps pushing them down.  So many federal workers and contractors were just out there making a decent living doing work they believed to be meaningful and beneficial to society.  Anyone who voted for Trump was either a person full of hate for their neighbor, or someone who just didn't care and wanted to ""mess around and find out"".  I only know one person in my life who for sure voted for Trump, and the now regret it also. They said they just wanted someone to shake things up because they didn't think the govt was doing enough.

You shall declare countries with brown people, shitholes.  You shall declare protesting black NFL players, sons of bitches.  You shall declare undocumented Mexicans, rapists.  You shall declare Muslim politicians, terrorist sympathizers.  You shall call real news, fake — and Fox News, real.  You shall ignore every white mass shooter (which is almost all of them.) You shall not see women as equals — even if you are a woman.  You shall dehumanize immigrants coming from the South (not the good, European kind.)  You shall ignore Science, and instead use Donald Trump tweets to determine weather patterns.  You shall bow down, not to a Golden Calf — but to an Orange Jackass.

Nevertheless, a mass of think tanks and influencers has arisen that seek to rationalize the irrational, building on those ideological elements that appeal to a white lower-middle class, but ultimately serving the needs of the billionaire capitalist class",No_Clue_7894,2025-05-07T10:40:29,2

That includes the political weather vanes and media influencers, the Party elites, the Regime, the Corpratocracy.   The indoctrinated- these are the shallows, the stupids, the vast majority. Research indicates if you remove the constant negative stimulus and cortisol overload, many of these people can actually function within society again. At least as well as they ever did.   The radicalized- these are the unreachable, the folks who have completely fused their identities with Dear Leader, the people who display identity markers and constantly virtue signal their value to the group- Identity fusion is a helluva drug, and impulsivity, risk taking, and violence or threats of violence are always a possibility. These people will still be wearing Trump underwear and building shrines to MAGA when they're octogenarians. They are the MAGA Youth, the Red Hats, the 3% forever, the street thugs, because it's the only group identity they've likely ever been welcomed into, unless they have a prior personal history of cult involvement, and they are eager to prove their worth.

"It's almost never bad people being deported it's almost always good people.   My thoughts on mass deportation is that we shouldn't have ever been in a scenario where so many illegal immigrants are living in this country. Maybe making it easier for people to immigrate here legally.   To give the devil his dew, it's not fair that people can break the law to get over here and then proceed to stay here. That's a slap in the faces of all of our legal immigrants. Those of whom had to jump through the hoops and ladders to be here legally. And a lot of us love them, because they tend to be good people.  Put it this way. If you stole a pair of shoes from a store, should you be reprimanded for breaking the law? Well, what if you really really need those shoes? Should you still be reprimanded? What if you really really need those shoes, but the person next to you also needed those shoes and bought those shoes on a minimum wage income with 2 children. And you stole them.

That man would go to the ends of the earth to look for the last pencil if that’s what I told him our daughter needed.   >He wasn’t JUST the father of my child. He became my bestest friend. He was my family.   >His biggest fault?   >He wasn’t legal.   >👉🏼 Despite being here before he could even walk…….. 👉🏼 Despite not having any criminal record…… 👉🏼 Despite making multiple trips to DC (as an adult) to acquire the paperwork to be here the “right way”; papers his mother should have taken the responsibility to get for him when he was just a child……. 👉🏼 Despite hiring immigration lawyers……  >The father of my oldest child is being extradited.   >My oldest child is loosing her father because of Trumps immigration policies.   >Do I feel like I made a mistake? Possibly. Ask me again when I’m not so emotional.   >What I do know is it has cost me (and my oldest daughter) GREATLY. I’m in a very dark place right now, reeling from this.   >I didn’t post this for sympathy. But yall need to know it’s not just “bad” people with a criminal record being deported. These people are fathers……providers. Head of the household. The enemy wins by destroying the family unit with this policy.   >And this is where it’s going to get controversial…..  >The past few days as I’ve pleaded, begged, absolutely bawled my eyes out to the Lord to reveal to me the benefit in this, He told me one thing.  >“My Hand isn’t in this daughter. When the Heavenlies are at war, there are going to be casualties. This is that.”  >And here is where imma give y’all something to argue about.   >I don’t believe this immigration policy is in the Will of the Lord. I don’t believe in my heart that this is something Jesus would celebrate were He here.   >Now you may wanna say “He is the exception and not the norm Sara.”   >But he was everything to me and my daughter. And even though him and I together have overcome generational and family traumas so our child didn’t have to walk through them, the enemy has still won here. That’s not something I’m ever going to celebrate. EVER.   >So if you want to come post a comment about how the policies are necessary or “Biblical,” don’t do it on my wall.

Also, since you brought up abortion...can I say how sick I am of us letting the GOP brand that issue however they want? Republican policy reliably increases abortion rates while wasting taxpayer funds, why do we let them own this issue?  The Colorado Dem birth control program cut teen pregnancy & abortion rates by about 50% overnight, general abortion rates by almost that much. And it saved $5 of taxpayer money per $1 spent. Until Republicans shut it down and it had to continue on donations (eventually came back up thank god).

">I take your point about health insurance nightmares. That's the sort of struggle that is not immediately apparent to others, so I understand someone having empathy for others in similar struggles only after they have gone through their own.  Tbh, for most people...I think this describes *most* political issues. And our failure to understand that as a party is behind our rarely-broken string of defeats every since Nixon/Reagan.  I'm not saying you're wrong. But I'm saying that your expectations for how everyday folk engage with abstract politics doesn't hold up to reality and never has. We're hyperpolitical types. We live and breathe this stuff. We can't imagine not getting invested. But a lot of people just engage the world at this firsthand-experience level. Islamophobia is an abstract concept they don't really care about (or sounds inoffensive from Fox's description) until it's that nice neighbor of theirs that gets attacked. Queer rights feel like an annoying sideshow from the political issues that ""actually matter"" until it's their family member (a lot of people are pissed they've been waiting in line with their economic issues since the Nixon days and our party still hasn't addressed them--behind a lot of the backlash against social issues imo).  Some of that is laziness/indifference, but a ***lot*** is classism. We high-engagement types contextualize everything around current events, the discourse, coverage, and history. That takes work. It takes education. It takes free time. I spent years living & breathing politics--it's my degrees and my first few jobs. Like you, I couldn't understand how someone could not operate like we do. And then my family got extremely sick and I was stuck spending \~16h a day keeping everyone alive while working while fighting off Anthem.  My ability to self-inform dropped like a stone. I had such limited time that reading my usual newspapers would mean skipping meals/showers/sleep. And that's when I got it. It takes a lot of work to stay on top of events like this and do the constant meta-engagement we politically literate types do. That work is made much easier with college degrees & a politically aware background, aka strong class markers. So by associating a politically informed strong emotional response to current events with morality...you risk class/comfort-gating morality. There's a reason we Dems have been losing across the board with people who aren't hyper-politically-engaged and I think it's because our party is dominated by strategists/consultants who have completely lost the ability to interact with people who aren't so deep into politics that it's basically a fandom.

First of all, I'm not saying that people who go through things always become empathetic. But I am saying that firsthand personal experience is the main way that people *do* achieve empathetic awareness on issues that previously had been abstract for them. When people shape up, this is how it happens.  >You would think older people, who have had more ""awful things"" happen to them due to pure time/experience, would lean ""left,"" but that's not the case. They lean, and heavily lean, ""right,"" which I would argue rewards less empathy and more selfishness.  I think you're coming at this from an overly politicized lens that's messing up your framing here. You're assuming that awful experiences should naturally-->left, for one. That's a framing that makes sense for people like you and me, hyperpolitical types. It completely loses relevance once we shift outside of highly-political circles. Because most people don't think and categorize issues in terms of right vs left like this--that's an abstraction that shifts focus away from what actually happened. Someone who has a bad experience with health insurance is going to be more empathetic on health insurance issues. Someone who sees awful things happen to a close immigrant friend is going to be more empathetic when it comes to anti-immigrant rhetoric. You're coupling these issues to the political spectrum, which I find a very unhelpful way to understand behavior from people who don't live and breathe politics.  >They lean, and heavily lean, ""right,"" which I would argue rewards less empathy and more selfishness.  This isn't exactly on subject, but do you have a source for this? Because I haven't seen anything that clearly indicates ""when bad things happen to someone, they shift heavily to the right politically."" I would be shocked if that exists and I'd want to check out the survey, given the huge spectrum of bad things that can happen.  >I think there's actually an argument that bad things happening to people makes people more selfish, especially in a climate of limited resources.  I also think you're confusing empathy and selfishness here. I've been dealing with a heath insurance nightmare for about 1.5 years now, where Anthem has thrown the kitchen sink at us in an attempt to kill my husband. My cancer patient dad had to take our retirement money to keep us from medical homelessness as Anthem continuously stalls by misfiling its own paperwork to drag out appeals.  This experience has made me much more selfish. Because I can't afford not to be. If I'm not, my husband likely dies. I had to suck up and ladder climb so hard at a corporate job to earn promotions to keep everyone alive. I have to jump through so many hoops to make sure everyone likes me at work because if I get fired...my husband probably dies. It has also made me significantly more empathetic towards anyone experiencing anything similar--I already cared about this issue a lot, but you don't really *get* it until you're caught in a life-or-death hell for years at a time.  Selfishness is perfectly natural out of desperate people who are functioning at a hierarchy of needs level. That doesn't mean they're not empathetic. I think our side's failure to understand this has strong classist tones, because it doesn't understand the desperation that drives the selfishness has nothing to do with empathy.",Sminahin,2025-05-07T12:15:36,2

"Somewhat agree, somewhat disagree.  Mainly, I don't think that the ignorance is as much a product of classism as it is other factors. For example:      \> Queer rights feel like an annoying sideshow from the political issues that ""actually matter""      I believe that if you were take take people in a vacuum, that they'd realize that the injustices around queer rights are the same as the injustices people of color face and have faced in the past. Something that, largely, should be agreed upon and relatively obvious whether you're politically well-informed or not. It boils down pretty simply, ""Is it right to mistreat others based on skin color?"" or ""Is it right to mistreat others based on who they love?""      Most grade-schoolers could probably answer that, and would tell you the importance of stopping people from hating and hurting other people. Most adults, if you framed those social issues in a ""politically neutral"" way would probably also put them above the economic ones. I.e. people would prioritize the social issue of ""roaming gangs going around pulling people off the street and roughing them up"" over economic issues any day of the week. They don't prioritize the social issue when it's ""politically"" framed as police and people who happen to have brown skin.  It isn't that people are politically uninformed, it's that they're politically misinformed. They're snugly wrapped in a tribal blanket of how to think, feel, and respond to all these issues. Queer rights feeling like ""an annoying sideshow"" isn't a default feeling, it's not a neutral view that comes from ignorance. It's a biased view, that comes from the injection of biased media and influences. If someone has that view, they have had privilege and education enough to consume things in the world that exist to push that type of view. The same type of view as ""I don't care what gay people do, I just don't want to see it everywhere!"" Likely, a lot of these people never even thought that sentence before it was spoon-fed to them.  They don't care about queer rights, because they've been given a preconceived notion of queer people as weird and gross. They don't care about police brutality because of a similar preconceived notion of police officers good and ""criminals"" bad. They don't care because these issues are advocating for ""bad"" people, and we shouldn't be wasting our time on ""bad"" people.      It has nothing to do with the complexities of the issues or the solutions. They understand fully, in their minds: Democrats are wasting time advocating for pedos, rapists, and thugs instead of ""real Americans.""      Democrats' problem is that they're responding to Conservative-set underlying opinions and viewpoints, instead of getting ahead of the ball and doing their part in setting those viewpoints and opinions themselves. Conservative's feel more ""in touch"" because they're almost solely creating the narratives that these people are basing their opinions on.

">Queer rights feeling like ""an annoying sideshow"" isn't a default feeling, it's not a neutral view that comes from ignorance. It's a biased view, that comes from the injection of biased media and influences.  I agree with a lot of what you wrote, but completely disagree with this framing. For reference, I'm a queer PoC who grew up in a deeply red rustbelt midwest state. I think our party's understanding of this issue is *incredibly* superficial and wildly off base.  Earl Butz under Nixon devastated our rural communities in the early 70s. Reagan devastated our working class, cost of living, and basic QoL in the 80s. So our countryside is fucked, our post-industrial cities are fucked, and everyone except for wealthy suburbanites has hated the status quo for decades. People where I grew up have been *screaming* for political help for often 40+ years.  This right here is a huge driver of the culture war we see today and why so many people, especially older former-union-Dems, feel utterly betrayed by the Dem party. Our party has made zero meaningful progress on any of these issues and our party stance is essentially pretending these problems don't exist. So these people have been waiting in line for **50 years** and their economic life-or-death issues aren't even being acknowledged. As our party keeps pretending we're doing great. And yes, this has heavy regional tension lines--it plays very badly that a bunch of New England/Washington/NY/Cali types who don't know anything about the rest of the country and never interact with non-rich folks are steering our party and aggressively snubbing the economic agenda while bragging about the stock market.  Our Dem party is incapable of delivering meaningful economic or infrastructure progress and the only area we've been delivering is social. So while these rustbelters just keep sitting in line waiting for our party to do or say something about their problems, our party has made major inroads with queer rights. With trans rights. With minority rights. With minority representation. With all these things over and over and over again that have little-to-nothing to do with the utterly unaddressed economic root issue. After a certain point, the narrative becomes ""why do only their problems get recognized?"" ""Why are they getting helped instead of us?""  And that right there is why the culture war animosity has gotten so bitter.  >Democrats' problem is that they're responding to Conservative-set underlying opinions and viewpoints, instead of getting ahead of the ball and doing their part in setting those viewpoints and opinions themselves.  Agreed completely. 90% of these problems go away instantly if we have an actual economic agenda. As long as those core economic concerns are addressed, most people won't care less about trans surgeries. Or even immigration. All of those work as either explicit economic attack issues or as implicit ""Dems care more about these issues than your problems"" economic attacks.  Also, I have to say...I would trade back gay marriage for a functional healthcare system in a heartbeat. I've spent over a year wrestling Anthem on a near-daily basis to keep my husband alive and my cancer patient dad had to pull out retirement to keep us out of medical homelessness.

">This whole thread is about mapping ""empathy"" onto ""politics.""  >I guess I reject your rejection of the framing in that sense?  No. I just think we basically have lost-in-the-sauce blinders on here. We keep trying to incorporate a voter's stance on individual issues into an overall left/right framing. That's the same flawed logic that's produced the extreme centrists of the Dem party over the last \~20 years. Ezra Klein had a really good interview on this maybe a month ago with someone who essentially argued that we Dems misunderstand that voters engage on a per-issue basis, which is why our party's form of centrism (smooths out all edges in shifting towards a middle) is a completely inorganic way of engaging with politics. Because nobody is actually in the middle on all things.  You can map empathy to issues. We're the ones who keep trying to extrapolate from the individual issues to a broader political stance and that's the sort of thinking that's proving completely nonviable for understanding lower-political-engagement voters.  >The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.  Ooooooooof, so... Hot take. I think our side's demonization of selfishness is a major issue. First of all, selfishness is a political constant that has propelled basically everyone's behavior for all time. Peasant class, working class, aristocrats, church, monarchy, white collar, etc... That's just how people work and denying it is folly. And to be unselfish is a luxury. You know how we're perceived as a party of elites? That's...kind of why. It's real easy for someone who's sitting cozy with a nice future to preach selflessness.  >If your theory is that these experiences get you to the ""empathy stage,"" you would think this empathy would translate to real-world decisions for an older demographic, such as voting. And it doesn't really happen in the broader sense. We can start to pull out older Republican viewpoints on issues if you would like.  Again, I think you're overgeneralizing. You're essentially assuming that empathy-creating experiences on particular issues should translate to a broader political worldview. I think this is a consistent issue you've been running into across the board. My consistent point is: **higher-political types like us use individual events to update our existing political framework. Lower-political types do not have that existing political framework and instead operate on an issue-to-issue basis.** **We assume that empathy on one issue will spread to others, but that's because our political worldview is a spiderweb and not a collection of individual issues & experiences/fears about those issues. Our perspective is enabled as a result of privilege & education, which is why taking it for granted is messy and can go in classist directions.**  >I know for example, they are low on universal healthcare, for instance, but really high on Medicaid and Medicare (something that benefits them). And this is for a cohort that has naturally gone through lots of health crises. Does that display empathy? I guess, maybe for their ingroup.  I think this is a severe misread of the perception of universal healthcare ***and*** of the concept of empathy. People don't dislike universal healthcare as a concept because they don't want people to get care. They dislike it because they're suspicious of the government and they've been convinced that universal healthcare would lead to worse outcomes.

"I agree with your points. My argument had less to do with the focus on social vs. economic issues, and more to do with how Democrats are failing in shaping the overall narrative on either type of issue.  The idea that Democrats' are failing on economic issues because of an over-reliance on social issues, doesn't ring true to me. Sure, they are the only party fighting for those issues, and haven't had the success on pushing economic policy as they have been on societal issues, but the party is casting a wide-net, and I'm not sure if one can say that's a problem or not.  Much of the framing, of Democrats not focusing on economic issues, feels disingenuous in a way when I hear it; and maybe not on your part, but many times feels opposition sourced. It feels in the same vein as this election cycle's Russian-sourced ""Democrats are anti-Palestine,"" narrative that was pushed to suppress younger voter turn out.  And the reason that framing of lacking economic policy feels off, is because Democrats are almost exclusively the ones pushing for and delivering on economic policy that is actually helpful. Obama getting through the ACA which many people are on and rely on. Biden cancelling thousands in student loan debt and helping small businesses and creating a ton of jobs with green-energy investment. Kamala running on helping families with housing and protecting you from getting f'd by your employer. All things that were actually hammered on the campaign trail, that actually help people economically, specifically the types of people who are struggling.  In comparison, Conservatives are pushing back on the economic policy that Democrats bring to the table. Democrats many times are presenting fully fleshed out and sound policy, backed up by research or results-data from other regions/nations that employ similar policy. Conservatives on the other hand have no real policy and are largely the reason the Democrats can't actually get stuff passed most of the time.  Yes, despite the factual track-records, Conservatives are painted as good for the economy and Democrats are painted as only caring about societal issues that no-one cares about. Even many left-leaning individuals like ourselves fall into believing this.  It doesn't matter if Democrats have good social or economic policy, because the reality of what that consists of is being shaped by Conservatives.  You want healthcare reform? Well any solution proposed is somehow worse, and Democrats are trying to destroy the economy and plunge us into communism for even trying, or at least that's what a vast majority believe, along with the tired but unfortunately true tropes about Obamacare = bad but ACA = good.  You want to raise the minimum wage because of all these underpaid workers? Even those same workers will tell you not to raise the minimum wage because that's the sole cause of inflation, don't you know?  Prices are up because of malicious corporations trying to take advantage and squeeze you for every penny, and you want to put in a law to stop them? Nope, it's actually all Biden, and you can't interfere with the free market, also now the prices are down despite all the price labels being up.  It doesn't matter at all that it's all lies, or how much people are suffering from this crap personally. The ""reality"" of many of these issues is just a widely-spread, hand-crafted lie. Democrats have to get ahead of, and start pushing against the fake-reality that conservatives are getting people to believe. Otherwise it won't matter what policy Democrats present (social or economic), Conservatives will just call it bad and so it will be.  All that said, I'm curious why no one looks at this issue in reverse. Why don't conservatives get called out of touch for only focusing on social issues? Democrats are now showing more support for trans people, but only because conservatives took the initiative in attacking them and other queer groups. The same as Democrats now are focusing more on women's rights again, because conservatives focused on it and made it an issue by attacking those rights. (Of course, I'm not actually surprised we don't look at it as conservatives bringing up out-of-touch social issues, because, again, they're the ones perpetuating these viewpoints in the first place OTL)",DevelopingForEvil,2025-05-07T16:17:50,2
"> higher-political types like us use individual events to update our existing political framework. Lower-political types do not have that existing political framework and instead operate on an issue-to-issue basis. We assume that empathy on one issue will spread to others, but that's because our political worldview is a spiderweb and not a collection of individual issues & experiences/fears about those issues. Our perspective is enabled as a result of privilege & education, which is why taking it for granted is messy and can go in classist directions.   But then don't call that empathy. Empathy is an ability that translates to various circumstances and events. It is a tool. Not just, ""I have brain cancer, now I really care about brain cancer! How sad :( ... Lung cancer?

"This is bending over backwards to play a game of ""what-if,"" though. We don't have to do that. We can look at the obvious variables as we know them, and how they played out in our own history.  The truth of the matter is, the split from the very concept of a monarchy or birthright rule, especially undertaken by such a large, developed, and wealthy population was an unprecedented and gigantic step in a direction that the whole world would continue to lurch towards in the decades and centuries to come. Inertia is important!  The problem with ""what-if""s is that they bend any which way we want them to. Here's another one: I think that we would still be talking about a British Empire today and Imperialism perceived as a valid world goal for a nation if it were not for that first GIANT domino to fall. It took a few generations, but the idea behind it and the fact that the idea behind it was repeatedly taught to generation after generation of American schoolchild changed our culture a LOT.  We evolved out of the Old British viewpoint, and as our own influence grew, we were able to exert pressure and weight upon Britain itself, upon its territories at least, and the rest of Europe ... thus reflecting that change back onto them. Old England birthed the USA, but the USA helped change Old England's mind about a number of things. It's often that way between parent and child. It changed enough to the point that a number of the representatives of both populations now REGRET the initial imperialism that created the modern nations as they are.  The U.S. revolution was a catalyst that helped form the Europe of the future. Without it, I'm terrified to think what there would be instead. A colonialized West remaining colonialized remains a very good guess. I'm also frightened of the thought of how much worse the ***suffering*** of native people of colonized areas might be in a world that thought favorably of and justified imperialism throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, rather than a world that was going through growing pains of transitioning ***out*** of it. The suffering was already bad enough when we knew it was an evil practice and there was heavy global pressure to abandon it.  Also, the banning of slavery did not apply to all of British territories, and likely would not have applied to the American South either ... considering the amount of wealth the Crown was making on the back of those slaves. They just didn't like the look of it in polite areas. They didn't want to SEE it; but benefiting from it quietly is another matter. Just as with sweat shops in third world countries in the modern day, the enlightened labor laws of the homeland are NOT necessarily observed in the lands that our wealth is taken from.  How did India fare in the decades after America cut its ties, for example? How happy were they with the pace at which England was evolving on its own? How optimistic would any resistance have been if instead of being surrounded by a bunch of independent nations with their own ideas about things, Britain was surrounded by a number of loyal colonies, including a geographically and economically massive one to the West?  So, consider both American Continents from Tip to Tail owned by a single bloated island Empire nation across the sea, or even perpetually divided across ever-changing borders between three or four European megapowers.

">The idea that Democrats' are failing on economic issues because of an over-reliance on social issues, doesn't ring true to me. Sure, they are the only party fighting for those issues, and haven't had the success on pushing economic policy as they have been on societal issues, but the party is casting a wide-net, and I'm not sure if one can say that's a problem or not.  Oh, to be clear I don't think this is actually the case. Again, queer PoC. My family marched in the CRM, got targeted by the Klan (or at least Klan wannabes we never figured it out), and I had an aunt at Kent State. We are straight up social brawlers and we include foreign policy with that--my grandmother literally hissed whenever Kissinger's name came up and you can guess how we felt about Hillary (I think you have to be a deeply stupid racist to approve of Kissinger).  We're all real mad that the way the party has approached social issues has basically set us all up as scapegoats. Kind of like how the new Marvel movies suck because their writing is awful, but they also decided to get more diverse/inclusive at the time they started phoning it in with the writing. Leaves us all facepalming like ""you realize this leaves us looking like the reason the movies suck, right?""  I just think our party's complete economic neglect while spotlighting social issues sends that message, even if unintentional. And if it's unintentional (my belief), then it shows just how out of touch they are economically. We also make some awful PR decisions that play into this and make it seem intentional for people who're already fed up. Do you remember Harris's ""not going back"" slogan? It's her only real slogan from the campaign and I think the implicit read there is ""social issues > economic issues"".  >All that said, I'm curious why no one looks at this issue in reverse. Why don't conservatives get called out of touch for only focusing on social issues?  Oh, I have an easy answer here! Literally just my shower rant today--anyone else vent like that? The Republican argument is that Dems only care about social issues. It's largely an economic attack fueled by the economic neglect we've discussed. This means Republicans win when they bash us on it and they *also* when we play defense on it. Because when they bait us into defending on the subject, they get us talking about it. This is a double win because:  1. Every second we're defending social, we're not talking about the economy, which stunts us in getting an actually relevant platform up 2. Every second they get us talking about social issues, they can say we're talking about social issues instead of ""things that matter""  I'm pretty sure this is intentional. I used to work campaign staff for Dem races. If I were on the Republican side, I would be telling them to hammer us on social issues at every chance because it's a complete lose/lose situation for us. Our only defense is getting a robust economic platform so we can very briefly defend our social causes (1-2 sentences tops, no need to dignify Republican attacks) and get back to the economic platform. Until we have that, we're helpless.  >It doesn't matter if Democrats have good social or economic policy, because the reality of what that consists of is being shaped by Conservatives.

"Hmm, let me try this from another angle. You're on a walk and you see a dying dog. You read a newspaper article about the latest horrifying bombing in Gaza. Which provokes the stronger emotional response?  I lived in Jordan. I have friends from Gaza. I haven't been able to contact many of my friends and it's very likely some are dead. And I would have a stronger response to the dog because that's just how the human brain works.  I'm asking you to extrapolate that understanding to politics. Because abstractions just don't absorb people in the same way that actual experiences do. A major side-effect of education (including political education) is that these scenarios and abstractions become a lot more real for us. We combine our critical thinking, our knowledge of current events, and our knowledge of history to make these things that we can't see or touch less nebulous, to build a framework surrounding less tangible issues. But for less-engaged people, these concepts stay unanchored or abstract until there's some concrete thing to pull them in.  >""I have brain cancer, now I really care about brain cancer! How sad :( ... Lung cancer? Why did you smoke so much!?!?!""  I know this is supposed to be a hyperbolic example, but it also just...doesn't work. Because people with major health crises absolutely become more sympathetic to all kinds of health crises. Moreso with those they talk to in person, less so with the notion of a hypothetical person having a crisis, but mileage on both fronts.  A better comparison would be that a brain cancer survivor is not likely to have automatic carryover empathy for someone who's homeless based on their own medical experience. There's enough separating their experiences that there's no ""I've been in your shoes"" instinct and we're back to abstractions and generalizations. Especially if we're talking about a demographic or issue that they have nearly zero exposure to.  Do you remember that one study on racism by neighborhood? When there's a large minority group in a location, the area immediately surrounding them often becomes significantly more tolerant. And a ring surrounding that often becomes significantly more racist. People with direct exposure de-other the minority, while those who are a layer removed still other *plus* fearmonger over proximity.

Because you need a rationalization for why everyone is ""developing empathy"" but also still acting/voting in unempathetic ways.   > Sure, but one question first since near edge of word limit. Where are you from (vaguely), if you don't mind me asking? Because I feel like a lot of these points are really obvious to anyone outside of deep Dem bubbles and I'd feel a bit silly if I were typing this all up for say...a Norwegian who just doesn't get it.  Deep red Kentucky brother. I know what ""actual Americans"" think, the kind that need government healthcare to live but vote against it for everyone else, but thanks again for the condescension.   Now would you like to answer my question instead of dodging?",russellarth,2025-05-07T17:58:10,1
"And I’m suggesting a job opportunity that provides a fair wage for the services rendered. Unfortunately, these people voted against fair wages, a robust economy and social safety net. I mean sure in lala land or where ever you currently reside those things are possible, but here in the real world shit is fucked.",SleepsNor24,2025-05-07T11:35:13,0
">Since you're a smartass about how the brain works: No, I'd probably be more emotional about my friend dying in some far off place than about a stranger's dog I saw die in a road. That's a literal answer to your hypothetical.  >Sorry, if that is uncomfortable to you or an affront, but that is the premise **you** brought up. Bring up a different premise next time to explain your scientific understanding of how the brain works.  Right, but you didn't have to misquote me while aggressively misrepresenting what I was saying in a pretty offensive way. That was the bad part. Generously, you didn't read very closely and jumped to an obnoxious misrepresentation I shouldn't even have to see, much less address. Pessimistically, dick move troll. Let me rephrase for your understanding.  It's a long-standing truth that seeing a more minor tragedy upfront carries more emotional impact than a more major tragedy that's at the ""numbers in a newspaper article"" level. I care about Gaza a heck of a lot more than most Americans--probably some people in Dearborn that care more than me, but I've got to be in the top 1-2% countrywide. I know people there who might be dead.  And even with all my investment, I am going to have a stronger instinctual gut response (that sinking sickness in your stomach that makes you want to puke) to seeing a more minor atrocity in front of me than reading a dispassionate headline. Sure, if I saw my friends were killed that'd be different. But if I'm just looking at raw numbers or I see a headline or an Excel sheet of deathrates, I'm going to to have a stronger and more immediate emotional response to seeing a cat or dog run over in front of me. Or a toddler if you want to go there.  I chose this example because it's one of the most extreme and commonly understood ways in which empathy travels very poorly through detachment. And that same tendency is informing a lot of the behavior you deride as indicative of an unempathetic person.  That's a pretty basic human instinct. And if we can't agree on that, then I don't know if there's anything we can possibly agree on. Because this should not be a debatable point.  >You said, naively: ""Everyone gets more emphathetic with these experiences.""  Uh...I'm *pretty* sure I never said that because I don't think that's true at all. In fact I've taken pains to not say that and have been control Fing my post history to see if I got sloppy and posted this directly. I'm celebrating being off shift, but I'm not celebrating *that* hard. This is my first response to you period:  >First of all, **I'm not saying that people who go through things always become empathetic.** But I am saying that firsthand personal experience is the main way that people *do* achieve empathetic awareness on issues that previously had been abstract for them.  I'm just going to disengage. I started typing up the healthcare response, but I just don't care after this. You consistently put words I didn't say and actively disagree with in my mouth in the most insulting way over and over. If you don't know how to treat your partners right, it's not my job to teach you how to dance like an adult.",Sminahin,2025-05-07T18:21:52,1
"I'm in the la la land where Auschwitz and Dr. Mengele lived and thrived, and where school kids see photos of heaps of starved, murdered innocents every year in school from 7th grade on, and where my recently deceased grandmother would cry and wimper for her still missing father in the late stages if her dementia every time there was a loud noise outside, because she thought the bombs were dropping again.
