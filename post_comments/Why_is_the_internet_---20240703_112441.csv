Because these kind of parties will use all manner of tools to try to make themselves sound important.   Social media also amplifies the fringes so your reform style parties get more focus than they would normally.,Iain365,2024-07-03T14:09:55,6
"The current poll of polls (which includes all polling data to show trends over time, rather than just a single latest poll) at [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/) suggests that Reform will capture 16 percent of the British vote, behind Labour at 40 percent, Conservatives at 22 percent and before the LibDems at 10 percent, Greens at 6 percent, SNP at 3 percent and Plaid at 1 percent.  Of course, the UK has a special electoral system based on first-past-the-post single member electoral districts, which can lead to a disproportional allocation of seats. [YouGov's MRP poll](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-election-final-mega-polls-predict-total-tory-annihilation-labour-win/) ony predicts 3 seats for Reform, out of 650 total seats.   I do not know how we should estimate what the consensus online is, due all echo chamber effects and algorithmic selection, but it does not seem to square with polling data at least.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-07-03T16:47:52,1
