"Excerpt  >The Trump administration has been examining whether it can label some suspected cartel and gang members inside the US as “enemy combatants” as a possible way to detain them more easily and limit their ability to challenge their imprisonment, according to multiple people with knowledge of the deliberations.  >The “enemy combatant” designation could also be applied to suspected narco-terrorists outside the US, the people said, as a way to potentially give the US a justification to conduct lethal strikes against them.",undercurrents,2025-05-04T19:08:08,12

So trying to find another way around due process.  If they are criminals arrest them and prosecute them. This will just lead to the US executing people they say is a possible gang member without evidence.,sedatedlife,2025-05-04T21:30:38,3

"The war on drugs was never a war, it was a marketing campaign.  It sounded silly at the time and still does.  What does a “war on” even mean when the topic is an abstract idea like drugs, poverty, or ignorance?  Newscaster: “Idiot troops moved in to Columbus Ohio today as the front in the war on poverty continued moving eastward.  The library forces used catapults to rain books onto idiot positions here, here, and here [gestures to a map] with little effect. Idiot forces employed their diabolical new weapon, toxic Taco Bell farts, to flood a bookstore filled with civilians on Elm street.  Thirty seven people died in the attack.”  Nixon invented the “War on Drugs” to divide the nation.  He wanted to marginalize the intellectuals that wanted to end the war in Vietnam.  He first passed the Controlled Substances Act to make drug use illegal, and then associated these pot smoking, acid taking “dirty hippies” with black and Latino populations.  This scared the “fine, upstanding” mostly white conservatives into supporting his actual war effort.  Sound familiar?  It’s the same today, but Trump is associating tattooed cartel thugs with people protesting authoritarian rule, both here and in Israel.   In a legal sense, a war implies geopolitical objectives and forces engaging on the ground.  Trump’s lawyers are arguing in court that Venezuela is trying to overthrow the US government by sending a small, relatively disorganized crime gang as an invasion force.    This gang routinely clashes with the Venezuelan government at home, and is so weak it can’t successfully compete with other cartels in the USA. Somehow these thousand goons are an existential threat to the nation?  It’s laughable.",guttanzer,2025-05-05T10:51:49,2
