"The biggest takeaway is that Christians need to stop with the victim mentality.    >Among the Jewish students that participated in the survey, 67% reported feeling discomfort expressing their opinions with others at Harvard, compared with 80% of Muslim students, according to the reports on antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias.  >An overwhelming 92% of Muslims surveyed at the university said they believed they were likely to face academic or professional repercussions for expressing their opinions, according to the report on anti-Muslim bias. Meanwhile, 61% of Jewish respondents felt they would face academic or professional repercussions for expressing their opinions, according to the report on antisemitism.  >Across nearly every area of concern, Jewish students reported greater levels of discomfort and alienation than Christian, atheist and agnostic students, but lower levels than their Muslim peers, according to the antisemitism report.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T07:17:22,6

"The article mentions the ""free speech debate"", and there was something Dara Horn said (she was on Harvard's antisemitism advisory board, I did my best to transcribe it). [It's at around 17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxS8iATYQqY&t=2120s).  ""I think the media depicted this as like it's all about these protests, and it's this question about free speech.   Not a single Jewish student came to me saying that they wanted to shut down free speech. Not a single student came to me saying, you know, I don't like the slogan they're using at this protest.   What they were saying was, ""I don't like people vandalizing my dorm room"" ""I don't like people spitting on my face while I'm walking across campus"" ""I don't like being chased through the law school"", ""I don't like being followed around campus by someone yelling at me with a megaphone"", ""I don't like being thrown out of class by my professor for being Israeli"".   There were students who were like, ""I don't eat in the dining halls anymore because there are people waiting for me in the dining hall. They wait outside my dorm room, they're waiting for me in the dining hall"", and then it's like ""haven't you reported this?"" and they're like ""the person that I would've reported it to is the person waiting for me in the dining hall""  There's this prevailing narrative that it's the pro-free speech pro-Palestine protesters against the anti-free speech Pro-Israel protesters, what is the line between free speech and hate speech, etc. when really what students were asking for was to be **protected from persistent antisemitic harassment and intimidation.**",bigElenchus,2025-04-30T14:02:20,0
"No one should feel unsafe. Lets remember that it's the Republican party that has for decades courted anti semites. That very recently Republicans marched with Tiki Torches chanting  Jews Will Not Replace Us. And several leaders in the administration hung their heads in shame as trump declared there are Good People on Both Sides.   For this Republican administration to use Jewish people and the very real danger of anti semitism as a way to cover their fascist attempts to control the people of the United States is unconscionable.   To use them to take away rights , destroy due process, change the history of the oppressed, depersonalize the members of marginalized communities that Republicans use as scapegoats in order to rile up their MAGA base is so shameful and heinous we need to raise our voices and stop this now.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T14:48:42,2
