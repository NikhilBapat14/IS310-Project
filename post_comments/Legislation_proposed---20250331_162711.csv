"These are great bills.   > The RECOURSE Act—Reciprocal Enforcement of Claims On Unpaid or Reduced State Entitlements—would create a system for the state comptroller to report on the amount of money that the federal government owes New York, as determined by court rulings. If the report shows that the federal government withheld funds against court orders, the governor, comptroller, and budget director could withhold that amount from payments to the federal government. Their unanimous vote would trigger the Commissioner of the State Department of Taxation and Finance to withhold matching funds, securing that money for the work of state agencies providing local services.  > The BRIDGE Act—Building Recruitment and Incentives for Dedicated Government Employees—would offer a pathway for fired former federal workers to join New York’s state government workforce. The bill would give them up to three years of partial credit toward their potential state pension to sweeten the deal. Still, they’d have to pay in an amount calculated by multiplying their years of federal service by a percentage of their previous year’s compensation.",buffysmanycoats,2025-03-31T18:21:43,50

"Blue states have high income taxes, so we don’t rely on federal help as much as Red states that are living off sales tax and property tax and sucking Blue states dry.",Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-01T09:37:55,3
I can only speak from memory but I listened to a podcast about something similar to this and I believe the federal government could do some pretty ugly things in response to it - like forbidding banks or credit card companies from doing business in the state(s). I am NOT POSITIVE about that though.  (At one point I was wondering if a state could limit the IRS liability of its residents by setting up its own payroll company that all employers would be required to use. Said company would collect the federal taxes but then “forget” (ha ha) to actually forward them. Same problem as the first thing though.),uhohnothim,2025-04-01T02:19:50,3

"""As cited by Ramos, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli reported that in fiscal year 2022, New York collected $361.8 billion in federal taxes and received $383 million in federal spending""    Taxes. Various. But the state doesnt really collect a lot of the various taxes directly. So i am wondering, having not see the details of the legislation,  are they just going to say legal residents / businesses of NY no longer are obligatied to pay fed taxes and the state will protect you from fed prosecution?  Or is it going to be just like excise taxes, something the states do collect on behalf of federal government?",throwawtphone,2025-03-31T20:33:29,5

I really dont know but  I would lo e for someone to chime in who could tell us more on how this would work.  I wonder if the bill is up on the state level legislative website,throwawtphone,2025-03-31T21:00:53,1
