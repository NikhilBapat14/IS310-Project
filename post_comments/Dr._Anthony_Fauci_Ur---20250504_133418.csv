What we need is for social media users with large followings to be legally required to make **all** of their income sources public. I think that would be one of the most important and impactful policies of this era in helping deal with intentional disinformation being spread by bad actors.,destinyeeeee,2025-05-04T15:31:19,43
Dr. Fauci is my personal hero. He is an amazing role model. He has helped so many people all over the world. His worldview is worth adopting. That is all.,drnoonee,2025-05-04T16:24:25,91
Stop using terms like “untruths”. Stop minimizing their actions. They are straight up lies.,Freebird_1957,2025-05-04T17:56:42,40

He's preaching to the choir. Disinformation is the language Republicans speak. They're not going to listen if Fauci or anyone else tells them to stop talking.,wonkalicious808,2025-05-05T17:25:06,2

"Yep. And how he has stood up to the straight-up evil he’s experienced from the GOP. So many death threats and ill will towards a guy who has completely dedicated his entire life to the health and well-being of all Americans, regardless of creed, background, or race. He’s a hero.",Onlypaws_,2025-05-05T01:03:33,21

"I think the word is accurate. The definition is as follows: The word ""untruth"" originates from Middle English ""untrueath,"" which is derived from Old English untreowþ meaning ""unfaithfulness, treachery"". This Old English word combines the prefix ""un-"" meaning ""not"" with the noun ""truth"". The meaning ""falsehood"" and ""a lie"" emerged in the Middle English period, with the first known use of ""untruth"" appearing before the 12th century.  This all seems fitting to me.",CloakOfElvenkind,2025-05-05T10:52:52,5

Yes he is. He’s a brave man who has been fighting for what’s right and for science and truth for decades. It must be so heartbreaking for him to see the direction the country has taken the last decade or so. Just like it is for all of us who watch in horror at the craziness that seems to be taking over.,mmorales2270,2025-05-06T13:56:24,1
"100% correct I don't get all the love for this guy. He's been exposed has having been negligently irresponsible and then lying about it and getting others to lie about it. Democrats should not fall into the trap just because he's seen as having stood against Rand Paul and Trump. Sadly, Rand Paul was correct.",DetectiveBlackCat,2025-05-08T10:40:47,2
