"> The only way I see equality of opportunity as feasible is by guaranteeing the least-deserving members of society a bare minimum of living standards, regardless of whether they decide to get comfortable in it or decide to push their way up the ladder from there.  This is a pretty widely held belief and you'll occasionally see even folks on the right say things like ""we shouldn't do a dime of forgiveness for college loans while there are homeless veterans on the streets.""    And because most Americans generally believe that some level of basic economic security is important, Republican political leaders who wanted to cut those programs had to come up with narratives that undercut that basic value proposition.   Enter the ""welfare queen"" -- a term coined in the 1970s and boosted into widespread use by Ronald Reagan in his 1980 Presidential campaign.    The ""welfare queen"" framing restructures the entitlements debate around the issue of _abuse_ rather than _need_.  By putting frauds and grifters at the center of the conversation and making cuts to the programs about them, it becomes much more palatable to support deep cuts to these programs.  The non-abusive recipients who get hurt along the way are now no longer the target of the cuts but unfortunate collateral damage in a crusade against government waste.  Except.... fraud was never really that big of a problem mathematically.    Reagan was exploiting how humans tend to think about fairness.  There are echos of The Ultimatum Game here -- a famous game theory experiment in which Person A is granted a sum of money and asked to split it with Person B.  If Person B accepts the split, everyone gets their agreed share of the money.  If Person B rejects it, no one gets anything.   Rational actions should lead Player B to always accept any deal given.  After all, something is better than nothing.  But in practice Player B tends to reject any split where they get less than 30%.  The reasons for this are disputed but it seems to suggest that people put a serious premium on the appearance of fair play.  So by making the welfare debate about cheaters -- people who scammed the system to live in a way that voters might consider ""beyond their place or means"" -- Reagan and the Republicans tapped into a groundswell of support for slashing welfare programs, even though most of the voters who supported them would have agreed that rising from crushing poverty to any level of economic productivity was/is nearly impossible.",Killfile,2024-08-28T10:48:32,70
"Because they don't want to pay the taxes that are necessary for the social safety net. I guarantee you that if the social safety net was magically ""free"" and didn't mean that corporations and high income individuals wouldn't have to pay taxes to support it they wouldn't care at all.  A lot of times people mistake political ideologies as being the result of someone thinking objectively about a subject and then coming to a rational conclusion, like a scientist.  In reality these people are thinking more like lawyers, which most of them are. They start with a pre-set belief/objective and then develop the most rational and persuasive worldview of worldview around it.    Even in the case of those formally obscure academics who do come up with a rational explanation that happens to coincide with conservative thinking, they are usually promoted by people who have a vested financial interest.   Some professor writes an economics article that shows that would be a financial benefit for a 0% corporate tax rate? Next thing you know he's being sponsored by some think tank that is backed by billionaires who don't want to pay taxes.",mcjon77,2024-08-28T22:31:40,5
"I agree with your assessment of the situation.   I have the same questions, and more.    Many of my conservative friends also claim to be Christians.  I have read the Bible and I have studied the words of Jesus in church school growing up.   If we follow the teaching of Jesus, we would support all of those people to make sure they had the minimum to get started.   And there is the part about putting a camel through the eye of a needle is harder than it is to get a rich man into heaven.   Yet conservatives do not believe in these ideas or follow the teachings of Jesus.    I am not able to figure out how one can both support conservative legal proposals and laws, and at the same time claim to be a follower of Jesus.  It just does not make sense to me.",MontEcola,2024-08-28T16:17:51,15
"I think the main problem doesn't involve the matter whether helping is good, or not, but taxes and whether aid is given freely or through governmental coercion. It's quite possible many Conservatives freely give aid to local initiatives or specific foundations, and that's the thing, that they feel that they're doing this help out of their own free will rather than being forced to help. Furthermore, there's also the matter of how the government is using the funds they collect. Are they using them in the most efficient way, making every single penny count, or do they just throw money at badly managed projects? Furthermore, if these projects end up making private alternatives more costly, then it's not odd plenty of them would be against the idea of letting the government take their hard-earned money.  I think it would be different if public services could match, to a degree, the quality of service and availability that their private counterparts deliver. Also, more transparency in the use of public funds could help. This would make public services more appealing, and some people wouldn't feel like they're paying something they're never going to use when they have access to private services.  That being said, there's also the issue of prices. The moment the government raises taxes to companies or to the rich, those taxes tend to translate into higher consumer prices, which ultimately punish the middle and lower classes. I'm not sure if proposers of welfare states have presented any solutions to this issue.  Notice that any ""divide"" over these issues is nearly completely created for political gain, as these are problems that can be talked out and conclusions and concessions can be reached as a society.",Vlopp,2024-08-29T06:42:35,4
"Y’all really don’t understand capitalism. All these efforts to save it bespeak of a lack of a grasp of the selfish and chaotic nature of capitalism. You do for you. I do for me. That is the root of capitalism. That is the ideal strove for. Safety nets interrupt that whole thing and what I’ve done for me is no longer equal to you doing for you because you have benefited from those safety nets. So it is not capitalism you are proposing, and therefore it is not something they want.",FlanneryODostoevsky,2024-08-29T00:45:08,3
"It seems conservatives only want to pay for things that help them- the rest be damned. It’s ironic because many say they are religious but have little compassion for others. It’s selfishness, hypocrisy and a lack of empathy.",rswoodr,2024-08-28T20:18:15,2

Conservatism:   There must be in groups the law protects and does not bind and out groups the law binds but does not protect.   Safety nets for the poor go against this principle.,sbdude42,2024-08-28T13:32:33,4

 I am assuming u are speaking of America  - that’s what’s so wrong about speaking on subjects such as this  - many have the crazy idea that we are wealthy - not to burst your bubble but that’s insane - the reality - should I dare say the truth - is we are BROKE - 33 or more trillion in the hole and most of us can’t even fathom how much money that really is - but it won’t be easy to get out of that hole for at least the middle class who will pay for it - if that will even be possible,Psychological-Ball77,2024-08-30T17:22:41,1
The term capitalism has changed so much from when I was a kid that it's really not fair to call it capitalism.  When you suggest capitalism with strong social safety nets you have to realize it's no longer the definition..  Adding any conditions to capitalism makes it not capitalism.  Today's definition of capitalism is a widely accepted view of bare fisted cash grab.  What morals and ethics that were once intrinsic to capitalism have been removed.  Since no one is really accountable to the task quantifying good and bad people anymore It becomes impossible to administer abundant wealth to those who are justice and in need versus those who abuse and are indulgent. All of your upper class are aware of this and enjoy it.,sonny9113,2024-09-02T14:29:52,1

"Your point about the need for a basic level of support is central to any real debate about equality of opportunity. Conservatives might argue that such systems need to be carefully balanced to avoid dependency, while others would argue that failing to provide basic necessities for all undermines the very idea of equality of opportunity. It’s a question of **where the balance should lie** between personal responsibility and societal responsibility.",Puzzleheaded-Top944,2024-09-24T08:42:08,1
"Liberals are more likely to be on any one form of support at any time in their life, but conservatives are more likely to be on multiple forms and for longer. As such, a slight majority of welfare spending in each state typically goes to conservative households, just as a sizable majority of federal aid goes to red states.     They aren't opposed to social safety nets, they are opposed to anything that they perceive as helping non-whites and immigrants. ",valvilis,2024-08-28T16:44:22,1
"Many conservatives are fine with a social safety net if designed and run well.  Encourages work, helps people instead of trapping people.  Most American safety nets are sticky and difficult to escape.",hgqaikop,2024-08-28T11:10:39,-1
"i'll give my personal perspective on this: first, being conservative (or progressive) is something really vague and not a coherent worldview, so your hope to derive some logically following position from basic assumption is vain. second, i think our conception of being conservative comes mostly from the one state that is most prominent on the world stage, the one that has an entire industry of intellectuals and think thank working on reveling what being a ""conservative"" is: the USA. now, i'm not very much on the left myself, but it's kinda clear from the literature and the public debate that welfare is so much more despised in the US than in other countries because it favors blacks, which white don't see as part of their nation/society/community, so they just feel like they are ceding their resources to another community which they don't belong to. sorry if I didn't answer your question but I think that trying to solve intellectual contradictions is not useful unless you find someone who is actually trying to, which is such a small minority you'll only find in the library",samtheprophet,2024-08-28T16:48:33,0

Not being a smartass I swear but ARE THERE tons of homeless vets on the street? And why are they homeless? I live in Washington DC and you would think our streets would be absolutely flooded with homeless vets but alas very very few of the homeless are veterans. Not saying there arent scammers CLAIMING to be vets - THERE ARE - but most are just run of the mill mentally ill or addicted folks who cant get it together. THERE ARE resources available to vets to help keep them housed and provided with meals and medical care. They may not choose to use them but they are there.,tuna_tofu,2024-08-28T14:43:40,9

"I think it’s largely this, but there’s other major issues like waste, expansion and efficiency. I think there would be more support for rational programs if there were a maximum tax rate, transparency, balanced budgets and limited debt and deficits.   Instead there’s a group of people who are taxed heavily (near 50% total tax) and aren’t extraordinarily rich. They pay more tax in a year than most pay in their lifetimes. They also wouldn’t care if you spent money on healthcare, school lunch or direct transfer payments, if you capped their total tax at 33%. But they’re concerned about the next project they will have to finance all while there’s a ton of waste in the system that could and should be optimized.   There’s also a set of people that are net beneficiaries of tax programs, don’t pay much tax at all, but feel relative deprivation when resources find their way to other groups.",eusebius13,2024-08-28T18:38:22,0
"This is so absurd  These programs, or safety nets if you will, are a necessity. A lack thereof isn’t going to increase productivity: it will increase crime.

"> Many conservatives are fine with a social safety net if designed and run well.

"As someone who is currently actually literally stuck in the poverty trap of Medicaid (It’s WONDERFUL for my medical care but if I make any money I will lose it and no job I could find would be able to cover my medical costs), conservatives sure as heck don’t care about me or people like me.  They do not offer solutions, they just want to gut Medicaid and other programs like it.  All that does is just makes things worse.  The only thing I have ever seen besides cutting programs is to add additional hoops to jump through knowing some people won’t be able to (whether they actually need the help or not) and thus cost less by sacrificing people.  You’ve identified a very real problem with social safety nets in America but what do you see as a solution?  Why would you be aware of that as a problem and then vote for people who want to make things worse?",Welpe,2024-08-28T18:43:58,2
"I would agree with this. I lean conservative as do most of the people I know and no one thinks a social safety net should be removed; people fall on hard times and sometimes need a little help to get through it. The problem is generational welfare, where there is no real escape. It's just warehousing poor families to keep them away from obtaining anything of value.",Argercy,2024-08-28T12:40:18,1

"I volunteered at a soup kitchen for a while, in a small city that had a VA hospital. I met a ton of homeless vets that all had similar stories: they didn't have enough money to move to where the VA hospital was, and didn't have enough money to keep making the commute either. They were choosing between housing and healthcare. There was a shelter they could stay at if the weather was going to be bad or extra cold, but space was limited and they generally left the cots to the temporarily homeless - plus I gather the shelter had some theft and bullying issues. ",valvilis,2024-08-28T16:38:40,14
"According to the VA there are something like 41,000 homeless veterans.  Out of about 16.2 million total veterans that gives us a vet-homeless rate of 0.25% as compared to the 0.19% homelessness rate among the general population.  So, yes there are homeless vets and yes they experience homelessness at higher rates.

"As a veteran... you would have to really mess up to end up homeless after the military.    Veterans get an abundance of resources. I had free college (Bachelors and Masters), as well as free (albeit sometimes low-quality) healthcare, and various other federal and state benefits.   The military itself is also a good start to life, assuming you don't get horribly injured. Training and pay are decent for an unskilled 18 year-old. The majority of jobs in the military are non-combat roles.   Most of the vets that I know are doing pretty well in civilian life.

I do agree that conservatives and some church regulars follow that theory.  I understand the mindset quite well.   And do not agree with it. It is not in the Bible directly. It was not popular until the 1950s.    It is also very far from the teachings of Jesus.
