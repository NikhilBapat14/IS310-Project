">""we call into question the aggressive nature of this morning's raids""   State and national reform has been needed for decades regarding warrants being treated as if every home is a terrorist compound in Pakistan.   >Jacob said seven people were targeted in Wednesday's raids. No arrests were made. The attorney also noted that the warrants were signed by Judge Appel.  There's more to this and that warrant needs to be scrutinized. The FBI isn't ICE -- someone fucked up for no arrests to be made.  Judges and those applying for a warrant need to be held accountable for this shit.",nerphurp,2025-04-23T20:41:50,30

I want them caught.  But I also want the warrant to reflect the right location/time/people. This was a bad raid.   The FBI doesn't get involved in the raid for the lulz. This is a fuckup or the state/judge issuing a flawed warrant.,nerphurp,2025-04-23T21:16:22,9

"This was a completely justifiable and by the books raid that wouldn't be getting any media coverage if the suspects weren't being described as ""Palestine Defenders"".

Vandalism that is part of a months-long coordinated campaign by extremist groups against multiple staff members at this University.

"I did. In fact whenever I see a link here from a purposely misleading news source like Breitbart, Common Dreams, etc I always make sure to look into it further:  >Search warrants executed Wednesday against pro-Palestinian protesters were not related to campus demonstrations or related encampments, officials confirmed.   >“Today’s search warrants are in furtherance of our investigation into multijurisdictional acts of vandalism.”  https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2025/04/fbi-raids-not-connected-to-pro-palestine-campus-protests-encampment-ag-says.html   >The home of a Jewish member of the University of Michigan’s Board of Regents was vandalized early Monday, in what the university described as “a clear act of antisemitic intimidation.”  >The incident marks the third time Jordan Acker, a Michigan attorney elected to the board overseeing the university’s governance, has been targeted since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.   https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/09/us/university-of-michigan-regents-vandalized-acker/index.html  >The words “Free Palestine,” “Divest” and “No Honor in Genocide” had been spray painted on the front of the residence, police said. An object was also thrown through a bedroom window.   >University of Michigan Regent Sarah Hubbard confirmed that the home belongs to university Provost Laurie McCauley.  >Pro-Palestinian protesters have vandalized the homes of Regent Jordan Acker, President Santa Ono and chief investment officer Erik Lundberg in the past.  https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2025/03/ann-arbor-home-vandalized-with-pro-palestine-graffiti.html  No one was targeted for speech here, he's comparing police to Nazis because they're investigating vandalism.

"Bruh, you don't need to sell me on that.   I've got some pretty damn heavy down vote comments I stand by and refuse to delete if you need proof.   Your and my feelings don't matter here; unless you're arguing the results were intentional and it was just to put some fear in people not related to the search warrant.  That's not by the books.

“Today’s search warrants are in furtherance of our investigation into multijurisdictional acts of vandalism.”  You believe what you want to believe to lessen the Gestapo vibe being presented by this admin.

"> Pro-Palestinian protesters have vandalized the homes of Regent Jordan Acker  I don’t know if you have reading comprehension or media literacy issues or what, but this is propaganda.

The Michigan Attorney General is not part of the Trump administration. She's not even a Republican.  What's the argument here? The people spray painting Hamas symbols onto cars of Jews they don't like are innocent and if you try to prosecute them you are Hitler?,jts89,2025-04-24T00:55:26,1
I need you to put on your thinking cap and take a guess as to who would be spray painting Hamas propaganda onto the cars of University board members since the start of the war in Gaza.

"I'll do so if I can find anything.  Right now...  I'm striking out given no charges were made; I'm guessing this will turn into a FOIA issue.  But, I'll respond if I find something.  One point:  >The group says law enforcement confiscated electronics and personal belongings  If that was within the scope of the warrant, then it was proper despite the absurd raid. Seems highly highly suspect though. Just need to wait for details.",nerphurp,2025-04-23T23:39:09,2
