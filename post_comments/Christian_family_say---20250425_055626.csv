">Jane's family told Fox News Digital that they have been fighting for over two years for their daughter to be granted an opt-out from the course or be allowed to take an alternative class at a private school or do independent study under a teacher of their choosing to meet this requirement, to no avail.   This seems like a reasonable request. The fact that the school rejected it speaks pretty clearly to their real intent with this class.  This school system is preaching their progressive doctrine concerning a controversial lifestyle choice to a classroom of captive students. It's very unlikely that students are permitted to question the ""truth"" or wisdom of this doctrine during class discussions. This is not education. This is an attempt at indoctrination.",Farmwife64,2025-04-25T08:01:16,58
This sounds like a no-brainer for some hot shot lawyer to make an example of the school. Turn the pressure on make it a national story as much as possible get it into the supreme Court and make this school board go f*** themselves,PastorofMuppets79,2025-04-25T14:45:48,7
"Maryland schools have been thoroughly compromised by the leftist LGBT extremists. They probably won't allow parents to opt out their kids because no one would be left to take the classes. You'd think that would tell the school board something, yet there they are before SCOTUS for another case involving improper classroom instruction.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-25T07:07:52,27
"Messed up. Majorly messed up. Time to take the school Board to court, drag them through legal mud and headaches, soil their reputations.",ITrCool,2025-04-25T07:00:52,18
