"Elon had better pray that MAGA is a thousand year reich, because if any law abiding political party gains control of the government he's in deep shit. ",Xullister,2025-05-07T13:35:20,54
Most corrupt presidency in the history of the us? Or do you guys have an old slavery era prez that can top this?,Sndr666,2025-05-07T13:36:17,18

Musk leveraging tariffs to force Starlink on nations? This sounds like corruption to me.,MiHop89,2025-05-07T13:39:50,7
Don’t back down.  That is pure extortion.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-07T13:38:47,6
This is how the stupid tech broligarchs are trying to capture their new world order.   Zuck got kicked out of India for trying Musk's shit there too overtly. They're of the same overpriced gawdy cloth.,radicalelation,2025-05-07T13:40:04,6
"How is this not corruption? You have a sovereign nation telling another nation, “buy into this private citizen’s company or we’ll impose heavy duties on your exports.” Like, this is not that hard to understand and see as blatant corruption. Not to mention a massive conflict of interest for the man who both owns the company in question and has also been appointed the arbiter of fraud and waste in the federal government.",skag_boy87,2025-05-07T15:43:47,5

"Trump has a history of using tariffs as a shakedown tactic:  >Research recently published in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis reveals that **politically connected companies were significantly more likely to receive valuable exemptions from the tariffs imposed on U.S. imports from China during the Trump administration**...  >...**companies that made substantial investments in political connections to Republicans prior to and during the beginning of the Trump administration were more likely to secure exemptions for products otherwise subject to tariffs.**  >Conversely, companies that made contributions to Democratic politicians had decreased odds of tariff exemption approval.  >""Our findings reveal that politicians not only use exemptions to reward their supporters, but also withhold exemptions to punish supporters of their opponents, The tariff exemption grant process functioned as a very effective spoils system, allowing the administration of the day to reward its political friends and punish its enemies.""  >[https://phys.org/news/2025-01-politically-corporations-exemptions-tariffs-chinese.html](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-politically-corporations-exemptions-tariffs-chinese.html)  Trump is essentially engaging in a form of racketeering.  Give me something that I want, and I ease your pain.  You can safely assume that it won't be limited to Starlink.  Trump wants golf courses to be approved overseas, so let's trade tariff exemptions for approval.  Transfer some funds into Trump's cryptocurrency account, and your tariff pain is reduced or eliminated.  Trump sees government as a tool for embezzlement and theft.  Putin does it, and Trump admires him for it.",I405CA,2025-05-07T15:04:46,3

And then we need to endure MusKKK bitching and whining on TV that everyone is mean to him. Fucking nazi dipshit.,MarkZuckerbergsPerm,2025-05-07T15:18:41,1

"I don't know. They are evil enough, but mostly pretty stupid and lazy. The door's wide open for a power vacuum when Trump leaves.   I don't expect Democracy to snap back in time for the mid-terms, but I fully expect MAGA to evolve into something much worse when we see who takes over for the orange guy with one foot in the grave.",RealGianath,2025-05-07T14:19:20,5

"The US was very isolated from the world for many years. Jackson was likely as hateful and corrupt but didn't have the tools to be this far reaching. Actually the US was already hateful in that Era, Trump wants that for us again.",rainshowers_5_peace,2025-05-07T14:08:29,5

"From a historical standpoint if we are talking corruption, that goes to Warren G. Harding easy. If anything, the Trump admin is the second coming of the Harding admin.
