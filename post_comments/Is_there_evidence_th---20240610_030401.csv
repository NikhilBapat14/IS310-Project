"Saudi Arabia supports the establishment of a Palestinian state on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. There are security ties between the governments of Saudi Arbia and Israel along with Bharain and Egypt. Government controls just about any relationship in that part of the world. However, the relationship has deteriorated since the Conflict in Gaza; part of the reason is the population could turn against their own government.",PsychLegalMind,2024-06-13T11:56:02,2
