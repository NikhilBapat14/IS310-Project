I've been hearing reports of Antarctic ice expanding for several years (from the non-mainstream sources). Seems it's finally got to the point they can't deny or ignore it anymore.,Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-05-04T17:40:34,7

"Well it used data from NASA and is peer reviewed with non Chinese institutions. Does that mean they couldn't fudge it? Probably not, but since the data is publicly available and is supplied by NASA it is probably true.",DavidZayas,2025-05-05T14:24:08,5
"Here's the deal with places like China, and any adversary really.  They do lie and deceive for their own gain and our detriment.  But, if they lie about everything all the time, nothing they say is taken seriously.  It's all dismissed out of hand.  Sooo... Like any good propagandists... They sprinkle in some truths here and there.  Just enough to make it so you can't just ignore everything.  They're telling the truth in order to facilitate their deceptions, but that doesn't mean on the occasions they do say something truthful that it's not truthful.  You can distrust the motives of the messenger, but you shouldn't dismiss the message out of hand without examining it first... Because they may be tell the truth, even if they're only doing it to manipulate you.  Don't make the mistake of treating what our geopolitical adversaries say in the same way as the terminally TDS afflicted treat what Trump says.",Shadeylark,2025-05-05T08:54:36,8

"Yeah, but the Arctic ice is still going down I believe. However, the thing is that this isn't new (as you pointed out). This started happening a few years ago so i am just a bit confused on why is this seemingly new information.  https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2023/ice-sheets  The EU reported on this back in 2022",BranofRaisin,2025-05-04T21:40:15,18

"A few years ago, some idiot on fascistbook was using the Arctic ice shrinking to back up his ""global warming"" argument. When I pointed out that the Antarctic ice was growing, and faster than the Arctic ice was melting, they said - I shit you not - ""You're talking about the ice in the Antarctic. That's just one location. It's called **global** warming for a reason.""  You can't make this shit up, dude.",Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-05-04T20:31:25,8
I haven't seen that but it would be very interesting. The source from 2022 notes how Greenland and the Arctic lost 2x as much ice as Antarctica gained... so if now Antarctica is gaining more than the Arctic is losing that would be a good thing hopefully?,BranofRaisin,2025-05-04T21:48:01,6
"Pre-covid I'd heard reports on how Antarctic is was growing faster than Arctic ice was shrinking.
