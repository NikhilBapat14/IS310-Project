"The important part here is that these articles are unambiguously stating that Trump cannot constitutionally run for a third term:  >The 22nd Amendment bars Trump from running for a third term.  That doesn't mean that Trump won't run, but at least the media is setting the narrative that he will be wrong to do so without a constitutional amendment.",beatleface,2025-04-26T07:35:44,5

"""Its a joke""   ""Its a troll""   ""He doesn't really mean it""   Until his name is actually on the primary ballot and MAGA is doing mental gymnastics to justify the blatant disregard of the 22nd amendment¬†   How many times is it a joke till its just straight up not? Cause its one he keeps making including at CPAC...do yall really want some 82 year old to be President? Im 100% certain they can find a younger republican to run   I dont want him to run again but Ill just respond to these morons with ""Obama 2028"" going forward",blues111,2025-04-26T07:35:14,7
A ‚Äútease‚Äù?  What a jokester that Trump is.  Always kidding around. Haha.  He‚Äôs such an adorable scamp.  What is wrong with the US media?  We are watching the collapse of the US in real time and it‚Äôs amazing to witness.,i_love_pencils,2025-04-26T07:36:32,5
Not really a could about it. The twenty second amendment is for this exact reason! That being said‚Ä¶ expecting four years as business as usual president is amazing thing is incredibly presumptuous.,Smooth-Pomelo-3685,2025-04-26T07:32:26,2
"This really is make as much noise as possible to confuse the masses. Trump is either telling the truth, or is a massive troll.

He‚Äôs more unpopular with all demographics every day. His second (and last) term is three months old and already a complete disaster.   If you buy a Trump 2028 hat you deserve to lose your money.,sillyrabbit39,2025-04-26T08:10:26,1

"Nah the media would love nothing more than a third round of this clown circus. They're only talking tough now because there's still a chance he could pass away before getting the opportunity to run again or possibly decide not to go for it when the time comes. If he does go for it, I can already see the kid gloves headlines in the future:   ""Is there any stopping Trump from running a third term?""   ""Can the president run for a third term?""   ""Possible ways Trump can run for a third term...""   ""Trump breaks from country's precedent to run for a third term.""   ""Trump wins 2028 election""   To me the media has already proven they're not on our side and complicit with this shit show after how much they sanewashed his insane ramblings to make him palatable over the last decade. They love the ratings his daily acts of chaos gives them as well as the tax breaks when he's in office. Their tough stance right now is just for show, they'll fall in line and start to sanewash it/invite tons of corrupt propagandists on air to say it's acceptable to do when he does go for it.",LurksAroundHere,2025-04-26T08:21:49,1

This is what he does. He says something crazy that he wants to do to test the waters. And depending upon the pushback he'll either follow through or backpedal as a joke.   The big difference now is that he's surrounded himself with endless yes man who makes up fake polls to give to him (that has been proven) to make him seem like a majority of people agree and love what he's doing.,Virtual-Pie5732,2025-04-26T08:22:11,2
Good thing they have so much respect for the constitution /s,throwaway982946,2025-04-26T08:27:16,3
This is very likely (passing to a son) but the Trump brand is getting incredibly toxic very fast. Trump probably thinks ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll just pass it to Don Jr and then I‚Äôll get to rally with him next year and beyond‚Äù but who will go those rallies in a few years? His approval is cratering. People hate Elon even more than Trump and there are years yet ahead of daily focus on all the damage they‚Äôve done.  The empty shelves working Americans will be confronted with at places like Target and Walmart will be another nail in Trump‚Äôs political coffin. That‚Äôs coming soon and photos of empty shelves everywhere will be catastrophic for the White House. It takes months to fix supply chain problems.   Trump‚Äôs future is fucked. I think he‚Äôs trying to break and steal everything as fast as he can while he still can.,sillyrabbit39,2025-04-26T08:12:41,1

"For real. If we already upheld the constitution he wouldn't be president in the first place.  I'm pretty damn sure the oligarchs orchestrated all of this. The election was rigged after he was unconstitutionally allowed to run for 2024.   Unless we fight back, we will not be able to ever take back our own perception of reality. I'm already seeing footage being deleted from major news media in order to fall in line with the admin. It was something major too. I'm hoping I saved the video from YouTube and forgot but things are looking pretty sinister these days. Things that should be a matter of record will continue to be manipulated at his whim. There is NO freedom of press. Reality is what they choose. We cannot allow this to continue.",Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-28T07:16:21,1
"They're 1,000% not on our side. If you remember the multiple instances of Trump admitting to rigging the election, try to find that footage now. It's gone from major news outlets on YouTube.   It was against the constitution for Trump to run for 2024 yet it was allowed anyways.   Oligarchs orchestrated all of this. They're consolidating power for the foreseen future. Nothing will ever be enough for these types of people and now they run everything. They are currently our destruction. We have to fight back against this.",Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-28T07:20:07,1
