"A point I'd like to see Dems hammer more is the fact that these guys are such weak pathetic scared fucking wimps.  They live their entire lives in fear of a threat that largely does not exist.  All of this draconian law and immigration crackdown is because of made up stories about migrant crime.  Immigrants are not standing on every street corner hunting Americans for sport.  They do not occupy entire cities that are begging for ICE to liberate them.  You do not walk out your front door and get swarmed by MS13 gang bangers.  Can you find some stories about immigrants doing bad things?  Sure.  But this notion that America is being invaded, infiltrated, and marauded by  roving gangs is just BS.  trumpers thump their chests so much about liberty and masculinity, and yet they'll give up all of their liberty because they're hyper-masculine tough guy selves are scared of brown people.

"From the article:  *In September 2020, he warned that he would use force against Democrats if they chose to protest in the streets following his potential win on Election Day. “We’ll put them down very quickly if they do that. We have the right to do that. We have the power to do that, if we want,” Trump said at the time, according to Politico. “ Look, it’s called insurrection,” he continued. “We just send in, and we do it very easy. I mean, it’s very easy. I’d rather not do that because there’s no reason for it, but if we had to, we’d do that and put it down within minutes.” Ironically, it was his own followers who violently protested the election results.*  HOLY CRAP!  I don’t recall ever hearing that he made this kind of statement in 2020, which really did turn out to be ironic, especially because he labeled a potential Democrat demonstration if he got reelected as a “insurrection”, even if they didn’t storm the capital, or even if they didn’t try to pull in a group of fake electors.",mrmet69999,2025-04-29T15:47:39,4

"Rachel Maddow just reported on a situation that happened in Oklahoma where 20 armed men claiming to be with ICE, FBI and Homeland Security, with jackets featuring those organizations, stormed a residence. At home? A woman and her two young girls. Windows were smashed, the door broken down, and the women were held at gunpoint. They were US citizens who just moved from Maryland to Oklahoma. The husband was expecting to arrive in a few days. The armed men took their phones, confiscated all electronics, took their cash, tore apart every single room ""looking"" for evidence. Meanwhile, the mother cried out and pleaded with them that they are citizens and that the men need to tell them what's going on, what this is all about. They claimed they were illegal immigrants. But she showed ID's proving their citizenship. They were forced outside, dressed in underwear, into the rainy night and watched in horror as the house was ransacked. After the assault ended? The men left. With all of the things they'd confiscated, including cash. The mother pleaded for identification and a way to contact them. They were given NOTHING.  The local news reported the story. The ICE denied involvement. FBI said they were involved in a supportive capacity at first, then later switched to denying involvement.

Whats interesting throughout all of Trumps moves like this one is that no one in Washington DC seems concerned enough about precedent. If you allow this to happen that means future presidents could wield this type of power. The far right hated Obama and Biden right? Would you allow them to do this? No? Ok because you're allowing the next Deomcrat President to do exactly this by allowing a precedent to be set. I feel like if there were other leaders in DC or people in the right wing media brave enought to frame it this way that slowly but surely some of these loyalist lawmakers will start to snap out of it and realize theres damage being done here and that they need to set some boundaries.,Birdhawk,2025-04-29T12:16:29,2
