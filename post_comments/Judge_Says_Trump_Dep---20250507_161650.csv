"They're not deportations.    They're not being afforded due process, the die process our illustrious president was afforded when **he** went to court.    They're not being sent back to their country of origin.    It's called kidnapping and human trafficking.    Let's call it what it is.",Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-07T16:20:26,39

“Violate” means violate. It’s just violate.,Western-Corner-431,2025-05-07T17:49:13,2
It's a kind of Trumpian Nacht und Nebel!,nicoppolis,2025-05-08T06:10:40,1
"No, that book was fiction.   In that book the supreme court of the united states first took away a woman's right to an abortion, then they said that the president of the united states not only could continue to be elected despite his act of treason in direct violation of the constitution, but further said that he was immune from prosecution from any crimes as long as he pretended that it was an ""Official Act"".    Then the president deported an American citizen, and the supreme court ruled in a 9-0 ruling that the man should be returned the the united states as soon as possible, and the President just simply ignored them.   If this had been real life, and not a work of fiction, you would see the President trying to round up millions of people, ignore there right to due process, ask the military to setup concentration camps in Texas, and sign an executive order integrating the military into law enforcement in direct violation of the posse comitatus act.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-07T16:27:58,8
"My point is that in the book (which btw is largely based on real events, unrelated to each other but glued together as a new, fictional story), the overturn of democracy didn't happen overnight, or by deploying military tanks om the street. First, the extremists got elected. Then, they started implementing ""small"" unlawful policies against targeted parts of the population. eventually, it was not ""America"" anymore.",sesriously,2025-05-07T16:32:15,4
And my point is that this book is no longer a work of fiction.   Fascism has come to America.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-07T16:34:19,6
"""Fascism"" is a big word, but after seeing people literally being abducted in their way to school or work, under bright day light, by masked, unidentified government officials, and then sent to a prison overseas with no due process at all... yeah I guess it's hard to argue ""fascist"" is not an appropriate adjective",sesriously,2025-05-07T16:40:07,3
"What else are you going to call it?   Trumps actions are the work of a white supremist authoritarian fascist.   He has plans to round up millions of people, put them into ""Temporary"" concentration camps, deny them there constitutionally protected right of due process, and then deport them to countries other then there native lands, where they will be housed in literal death camps once they arrive. Places that no one survives from, where they have mass graves.   He just issued an executive order to integrate the military into law enforcement in order to allow ICE the personal necessary to perform millions of midnight raids on peoples houses, and the attorney general says that ICE no longer needs a warrant in order to break in to your home to do it.   ICE is snatching people off the streets, with no warrants, and deporting them to death camps based on which tattoos someone has.   This is fascism, and it's time that people realize what has happened over the last 100 days and realize that it's only going to get worse.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-07T16:47:39,5
