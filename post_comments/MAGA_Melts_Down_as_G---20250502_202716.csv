What lawmakers are considering is whether such a petition would be successful - which noone knows for sure, because as the article mentions, this has never happened before at a nationwide level for a party with anywhere near this level of support.

They want get rid of all foreign people and call that re migration, it's like Trump's deportation plans with paid camps/gulags in Africa. The even want to shoot people down on the border.  They work together with Putin and Russia and want that the ukraine surrender. They see Putin as alley.  They had several huge scandals during the last years.  They are behind the rush on the reichstag in 2020 (as later in the us, they tried to storm our ""Congress"" which is named Reichstag).  They use hate speech and also denied the Holocaust (which again is against German law).  They want to get rid of all taxes for the rich people and get rid of social security.  They want to leave the European Union e.g. dexit   They deny climate change and want to stop all studies about it.  The common things in their playbook look like the maga people ones.

Digitalization is woefully behind and there doesn’t seem to be a real technical innovation with a way of breaking out now.   Germany took a large number of asylum seekers in after the war in Ukraine broke out. It also has the largest population of Turks in the world outside of Turkey itself. These facts have gotten the right agitated and given them something to ramp up the rhetoric on.

The Weimar Republic that then famously collapsed in the rise of the Nazi party, and lead to Germany starting WW2 by attempting an empire over Europe?  That Weimar Republic? So already there’s the WR and the Nazi version of the German empire, so 2 different states in 10 years. Is that the militant democracy?  When that then collapsed you then had a 3rd version, so a split state half propped up by the US, UK, France, half of it a part of the soviet empire. So again a global power sharing arrangement where most of it was run from the US and Russia. Is that the militant democracy?  When that then failed you then had the wall and more explicit communism and people being shot if they attempted to leave. So this is maybe the 4th version of a German state in <100 years depending how you’re counting.

So as this era comes to an end you now have the rise of the far right again on an almost 100 year cycle, and at no point does “militant democracy” come into it as far as I can tell?  For the majority of the last 100 years it hasn’t been a democracy at all, really, and it’s been about half a dozen different nation states, and the periods where systemic murder was employed was during the times of democracy.  So…",SomeYak5426,2025-05-03T07:45:33,-19

You do realise that what we call conservative differes quite a bit from the american conservatives? Just a few examples: Merz is pro social security and fighting climate change. He will go about it in a different way than the old government but there is no talk of abolishing it. He is agains russia and pro EU. Problem might be that Trump heard conservative and imagined that they are the same as the republicans. So just a reminder that Merz is from the same Party as Merkel who Trump didn't like.,forsti5000,2025-05-02T23:28:25,679
"Germany has a bunch of major parties. The voting is largely proportional, with a 5% cut-off (there's a few other rules but whatever).   - AfD: the aforementioned fahr right party. Started as primarily €-sceptic, now full-service far right populist party. At roughly 25% in the polls. - CDU/CSU: center right party. This is Merz' and formerly Angela Merkel's party. At around 25% in the polls. - SPD: center left party. This is Scholz' party. At around 15% in the polls. - Greens: Environmental+ left party. At around 12% in the polls. - Linke: Left party. At around 10% in the polls.   There's also the FDP (was in the outgoing govt, liberal/libertarian) and BSW (splinter from the Linke, authoritarian/Putin friendly), but both don't make it past the 5%.   The new govt will be CDU/CSU+SPD, whereas the outgoing one was SPD+Greens(+FDP who broke it and forced a snap election).

"That's all true, but the most important fact is that the AfD, similarly to the Republicans with FOX and Rogan and the likes, has created a bubble of misinformation that a huge chunk of the population, even those that aren't racist and would never vote AfD, bought into.   Many believe in a huge economic recession, when the GDP is down under half a percent and most of that can be explained with climate change measures.   They believe criminal immigrants are a problem while crime is as low as it has ever been.   They believe refugees send money home so extremely expensive measures are being invented just to try and control where the tiny amount of money they do get goes, which costs Germany a lot more money than any fake refugee sending money home ever would while making the lives of the actual refugees extremely hard.  They believe tons of immigrants and locals are voluntarily not working while receiving social help while quoting numbers that include children, mothers, people earning less than a livable wage, and more, in them, and actual ""slackers"" are so few and far in between that the impact of the money they receive is negligible and finding them and ""dealing with them"" would cost much more than what they receive.  And so on. The right wing (with the help of Russia) just spent a decade successfully making a majority of the population think things are way worse than they are. There is the die-hard base that is similarly brainwashed as MAGA and believes completely contradictory points that fit the agenda but there's also just a big general idea of the situation being much worse than it actually is.  This isn't helped by the fact that the, according to the extremists, oh so left wing ""mainstream media"" constantly gives them a platform and in itself perpetuates some of these ideas, i.e. by having over 70% of crime stories in news feature immigrants involved in crime while the number of immigrants involved in crimes total is far below 30%.   So things have to change, but not like CDU/CSU adopting right-wing talking points and implementing extremely expensive yet ineffective measures against perceived migrant threats, but by clearly calling out those falsehoods and aggressively working towards spreading more information than the extremists spread misinformation.",Com_BEPFA,2025-05-03T10:50:41,2

"Eh, I don’t know. The denazification of Germany is kinda romanticized in my opinion. People think all it took were the Nuremberg trials and education for the masses. And once the people saw with their own eyes what was happening, they changed their tune. I’m German and it’s true we learn a lot about facism and Nazi Germany in school. But that is not the direct consequence of the denazification. The sad thruth is that it took decades to rid ourselves of the worst symptoms. Former Nazis were still in government and in important positions after the war. There was hardly an alternative because so many qualified people had been Nazis. And you need experienced people in government. The US also took a lot of Nazi scientists and they lived happily ever after, helping the US win the Cold War. And Nazi ideas and sentiments were still prevalent in Germany among average people for years after the end of the war.   What really turned the tide wasn’t the postwar denazification. It was the next generation, the „68er“. The children of the people who lived through Nazi Germany wanted answers. They wanted to know what their parents did. And they wanted it all out in the open. They’re the ones who came up with the culture of remembrance and open discussion of the Nazi crimes. And even with all that there are still Neo Nazis in Germany today.    I don’t think it will be much different for the US and their MAGAs. The ones who are already caught in the trap today will probably stay in that mindset their whole life. At least most of them. They’re lost. You have a chance to educate their children and maybe push the MAGA mindset to the outskirts of society within a generation or two if you can get a reasonable person into office next time around and if the MAGA crimes get publicly investigated and actually prosecuted. But once the idea is out there, you can’t take it back. There will always be idiots who will think Trump was the second coming of Christ even when he’s died of old age decades ago. They’ll probably idolize him no matter what comes next anyway. You’ll always have to stay vigilant about this.

"I just told you, look at how Denmark did it. They've effectively neutered the right wing there  ""Denmark has implemented a series of significant reforms to its immigration laws, aiming to balance the country's labor market needs with social integration and public concerns.  These changes, effective from July 1, 2024, encompass various aspects of immigration policy:   1. Family Reunification Reforms  Language and Employment Requirements: The Danish-resident spouse must now either pass the Prøve i Dansk 3 language test or demonstrate five years of full-time employment involving substantial Danish communication.  Financial Guarantee Reduction: The required financial guarantee for family reunification has been halved from approximately DKK 114,000 to DKK 57,000.  Criminal Record Considerations: Applicants with convictions or charges for certain crimes are now disqualified from permanent residency and family reunification, even if not yet convicted.     2. Enhanced Work Flexibility for Foreign Nationals  Fast-Track Scheme Extensions: Short-term workers can now extend their stay within the 90-day limit without undergoing new biometric or ID checks.  Job Change Rule Expansion: Foreign employees can switch their residence basis without changing jobs, allowing continued employment during the application process.  Bank Account Requirement Adjustments: Certified companies no longer need to ensure foreign employees have a Danish bank account; for others, the deadline to open one has been extended from 90 to 180 days.     3. Healthcare Sector Recruitment Initiatives  Authorisation Scheme Updates: Foreign-trained doctors, nurses, and dentists can now work without a separate work permit while completing Danish authorization requirements.  Positive List Inclusion: Social and healthcare workers have been added to the Positive List for Skilled Work, with a quota of 1,000 residence and work permits established.     4. Student Work Permit Modifications  Increased Working Hours: International students are now permitted to work up to 90 hours per month and full-time during June, July, and August.     5. Integration and Asylum Policy Adjustments  ""Ghetto Laws"" Enforcement: Denmark continues to implement policies targeting low-income immigrant neighborhoods, aiming to dismantle so-called ""parallel societies.""  Asylum Application Reduction: Through stringent measures, Denmark has reduced asylum applications by nearly 90% over the past decade, from over 21,000 in 2015 to approximately 2,300 in 2024.     These reforms reflect Denmark's approach to maintaining its welfare state and social cohesion while addressing labor shortages and integration challenges.

">But I am pretty sure that when she this happens part of her current base will feel betrayed about something.   For sure, but also most people (including our current president) don't understand there's three (once upon a time) co-equal parts of the government of which the Executive Branch is only one, and the President only part of.    So if a president follows the rules it's literally impossible for them to do everything they promise, or to prevent/fix everything they stand against. Impossible. But obviously the rules seem to have changed. So the question becomes, *if* we have another free and fair election (big if) and *if* AOC were to become president (also big if since a lot of Americans seem to think presidents sign Executive Orders with their penis or something, or that a woman might stain the White House during her time of the month and worry it might not wash out even in the cold cycle), would she follow the rules under the unwavering Dem belief that correct action in government always produce correct outcomes, or would she understand that when it comes to the lives and wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people OR stupid and appearently optional rules that the ends justify the means?   Either way it's absolutely impossible anyone could ever do EVERYTHING their base wants so yeah, some are gonna feel betrayed. As always and with everything this is way harder for Progressives than Conservatives. Not only do Progressives need to implement totally new things and completely revamp established ways of doing things but Leftists tend to actually know EXPLICITLY what they want, in what measure, and they want those things immediately and in full and are quick to turn on any President who can't do that, even to the point they give them no credit for the impressive things they DO accomplish.   Conservatives on the other hand will never turn on their president and whatever they do or not do it de facto correct as far as they care. Plus Conservatives by definition only have to maintain or regress shit that's already in place.    All in all not only is it literally impossibly for a Progressive President to follow through on all their promises, but their base will turn on them if they can't do the impossible because ultimately Progressives want to chance and advance the countries. Progressives don't get the luxury of a base of uninformed, uncritically loyal dolts and ease of destroying existing things instead of creating new ones.",calm_chowder,2025-05-03T04:47:39,5

"Yes, we are. We're skeptical of any kind of nationalist thinking.    It's inherently dumb. And we all know where it can lead in the worst case scenario.  Regarding the AfD: Germany is doing what it always did, defend itself against fascists.   Our country knows what fascism looks like. We've got an immune system trained to fight it now.   Our constitution is written in a way that anything right-wing is automatically unconstitutional.   The most important part of our constitution is ""Die Würde des Menschen ist unantastbar"".   It basically declares that the first priority of the German state is to protect everyone's lives and rights. Not Germans' lives and rights first, everyone's.  There are also no loopholes in the German constitution. Nothing that would have to be discussed. No grey area someone with dictatorial ambitions could exploit.  Our ""Verfassungsschutz"" is an agency whose sole purpose it is to find threats to the constitution and eliminate them.    Someone like Trump and the ""MAGA"" movement wouldn't stand a chance in modern day Germany. What they say, what they do would go against our constitution. It would be illegal. And the Verfassungsschutz would have shut them down.  I've been trying to explain all this to Americans the past year or so.

The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.”",Everdying_CE,2025-05-02T23:55:45,23

"But Goebbels was right though?  I guess I’m confused by the militant democracy part, because the Nazi party was elected, and then defeated by Stalin/Russia which obviously wasn’t a democracy, and the US, which at the time still had legal racial segregation and explicit/codified white supremacy.  So a dictatorship and democratic-ish and white suprematist state beat an elected dictatorship. What came next also wasn’t really a democracy?  And I guess I always wonder about when people say democracy, because leaders are elected all the time that people call anti-democratic, and in a pure democracy, logically, people can vote for whoever even if it’s bad.  So I think in reality most people mean a liberal democratic constitutional republic, or liberal democracy, where the constitution reigns supreme and codifies various liberal democratic values, but historically, this is absolutely not the “norm”.  If a nations people become genocidal for example, then logically a democratic government would also become genocidal? I don’t think a lot of people like this, but it is logical and so democracy doesn’t necessarily mean liberal democratic with modern assumptions.

All this money accumulating around them? Why they buy governments, they buy assets, they buy businesses. What else could they spend that money on?   Really put into persepctive, for me at least, that we need to bring back the 90%-100% tax on money over a certain amount. Use that tax money to pay for services that working class people can use to stay healthy, fed and housed. Because at a certain point the rich simply cannot spend the money they have hoarded.

"It's because we've built our entire society about one thing: Number Goes Up.  Not even an acquisition of actual physical or fungible property; it's all about number goes up.  What does the number represent?  Well, not how much you can buy, 'cause prices fluctuate with demand.  Certainly not how much you've achieved or your worthiness because there's a billion many ways to short-cut it depending on how badly you're prepared to act, and you can sure as hell inherit it for being born in the right place.  In the 1960s our ambition focused on exploring space.  We didn't get the Star Trek future but the endeavour inspired society; we were doing something other than number goes up, and we remember that era for its noble endeavour; that and psychedelic experimentation and the exploration of arts and the spirit.  I would say we have something similar going on these days; the birth of machine intelligence is kinda analogous.

"> What they say, what they do would go against our constitution. It would be illegal.    Just for your information, the 1940 Germany dictatorship wasn't legal either, because they removed the arrested political opponents from the vote counting. Nobody cared.

And under the American system, SCOTUS would rule the president isn't immune from court prosecution. And Congress would vote to impeach him.   The issue is that the GOP slowly ran a low-education, nearly brainwashing strategy on the news networks since over 4 decades at least, which now means a majority of people in the voting booths *don't know the importance of checks and balances and don't care about starting a dictatorship*.    Elon musk's DOGE brought privately-paid mercenaries to ensure they could put upgrade to control the treasury and other critical systems.  Those people prevented politicans from entering the buildings of the US government.    One of the reason why 2025-202X is messy is because during Obama's last year the GOP outright **refused to nominate SCOTUS judges** during an election year, then fasttracked to nominate a 3rd judge before Trump's mandate was legally finished past the 2020 election. Once SCOTUS's court was under their control, they had to wait to get a trifecta on the branch able to control POTUS.

Chandler Police Detective Seth Tyler was unsure of the type of gun, or whether it had a safety that was off.

"WASHINGTON—Claiming the fantastical creatures were “way too cool” to leave their investigation to a handful of so-called experts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. issued a statement Friday encouraging Americans to do their own research about dragons. “People, especially new parents looking for awesome bedtime stories, need to be reading everything they can possibly find about these ancient and powerful beings instead of blindly accepting the narrow range of depictions put forth by the mainstream media,” Kennedy wrote in a statement published on his department’s website, adding that too many Americans only believed what they had heard about dragons on Game Of Thrones while dismissing less conventional sources like Earthsea and the Dark Souls trilogy. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there claiming that something with two legs and wings is a dragon, but I’ve read enough to know that’s a wyvern and not a true dragon, which has four legs. There are some great subreddits on them. Just yesterday I read a romantasy fan fiction suggesting that dragons are capable of forming emotional and even sexual relationships with humans, but the establishment wants to bury anything that challenges the official narrative that dragons are big, evil lizards who hoard gold. Take it from me: Anyone who tells you dragons only breathe fire is lying to your face. They can breathe ice or acid or curses, be good or evil, and speak any number of languages, but it’s up to you to come to your own conclusions about how much dragons rule.” The statement went on to say that while Americans should approach dragons with an open mind, they should remain skeptical of Chinese propaganda depicting them as lame floating snakes with mustaches.",31LIVEEVIL13,2025-05-02T23:34:57,2

"Are you not embarrassed that all you can do is deflect instead of actually engage with the evidence and prove how and why it is propaganda? Like if I was in your shoes, I'd be so embarrassed that all I am doing is going ""nuh uh"" like a child  Respect for leaving your shame for the world to see",CallousDood,2025-05-03T02:13:16,11
You know that I have seen AfD speeches by i.e. Höcke live and he literally quoted Nazis?      Or did the evil leftists manipulate the microphones and he didn't really say that?,Shoddy_Squash_1201,2025-05-03T00:34:20,9
">Genuine question: do you think McCarthyism was a good idea, and do you think it was effective?  The problem with McCarthyism is that it's essentially what the right wing is trying to do, which is to oppress it's opposition with the weight of the state based on lies and propaganda.  Ultimately the line comes down to reality. McCarthyism was not based in reality. It was not the last and only choice in fighting a brainwashed public. It was a retaliation against the non-brainwashed.  >Because for how much I see Redditors decry it as an abomination, many seem to think it's a justified and measured response when used against their opposition.  To be frank, something can be all three of those things at once. I do not believe that the programs such that I am proposing are good answers, just that they're the best answers I can think of and the ones that have historically been used in these situations.  I would love to come up with an answer that brought people like you out of the fictional narrative universes that propaganda has spun for you, but it's near on impossible. You've willingly chosen to divorce yourself from reality and either try to seize absolute power to codify your hatred into law, or burn the world to ashes trying.  We can't let you destroy the world trying to uphold your desire to end minorities. If preventing you from doing that means damaging your rights to free expression along the way, I see no better way.",Despair-Envy,2025-05-03T13:44:45,1
"I was a kid. To the best of my memory we had internet service. I know we had dial up and it was loud as shit because that was back in the days of external modems lol. I remember something called a talk daemon? But that's hazy now. I'm almost 43. I remember the name of the ISP we were using (CRL.com), and i remember having to type stuff into a window to get to the usenet group. I want to say it was some kind of command prompt thing. Again, way too long ago for me to remember specifics. I was using my dad's computer in his home office.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-05-03T12:45:28,2
"Well said. That's a damn good analogy actually.  It amazes me that using LLMs is still uncommon enough that people still have to say they use them. Kind of amusing to live through the ""I have an email"" days again.  EDIT: That makes me realize that eventually we'll be including our ""Agent"" in our resumes. Like, in 10 years I bet that it will be no different than having an email. A default that is expected instead of a handy new thing some people do.",42nu,2025-05-03T07:54:15,1

"personally I think it's unethical to pass off LLM generated text as one's own, so I would hope that the standard eventually becomes to always say if it was used, currently most people using them are very shifty about it, claiming stolen creative valor",gutari,2025-05-03T08:11:11,1
"Yah there were, it just wasn't common for people to have home use of internet yet.",ThrowAwayGarbage82,2025-05-03T12:49:53,2
"Very true. If you're talking to someone's secretary, then you know you are not talking with them, regardless of communication method.  We're in the ""have an LLM do a job and then you personally sign off on it"" phase. As Agents become a thing, our psyches (both of receiver AND sender) will prefer documenting whether you are communicating with ones Agent or oneself.",42nu,2025-05-03T08:31:06,2
