Ofcourse they won‚Äôt back down. They are trying to project to the world that they are a global superpower. All they need to do is hold off for 4 years. In the mean time they still have the rest of the world to supply.,C-Paul,2025-04-07T20:51:46,1
"MAGA thinks Trump is going to fight them until the end... No, he won't be doing the fighting, we will. You guys like that tough talk, but what you don't get is that he's not the one who is going to be doing the fighting, you/we are. He's signing us up for a fight. He's just like your stupid, loudmouth friend who starts a fight at the bar and then slips out the back. It doesn't take bravery to sign everybody else up for a fight.  you really think that if he were going to have to make the sacrifices he's signing you up for he'd be so brave?",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T21:02:45,1

"Trump is a child this will end with 500% tariffs lol. China does not need trade with the US, there are many other countries China can replace us with. I don't think we can replace China though, well I guess I should say the whole world since  the orange menace thinks he can bully the whole world into tariffs without them retaliating.",Retrogaming93,2025-04-07T20:54:07,1

It won't take 4 years.  The US will be a barren hellscape in 6 months if China stops shipping goods here,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-07T21:02:29,1
"They know he just picked a fight (trade wars) with the whole world... Why would they negotiate now? All they have to do is wait a few months, let the world beat us down and then negotiate from a position of strength.",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T21:05:03,1
"I hope so. Something has to give. As a proud veteran who only wants the best for my country, we need the wake-up call and I'd rather it be a self-inflicted wound than something crazy I couldn't live with like invading Greenland...   I'm sorry for what he's doing to the world market. Once the consequences hit his supporter's pockets, he'll be losing their support fast.",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T21:07:16,1
There‚Äôs a big difference between acknowledging how dumb this is on Trump‚Äôs part and defending China.   But keep focusing on ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù while our economy goes to hell. You definitely are not an idiot.,standalone157,2025-04-07T20:52:07,1
You don't have to support China to recognize a 108% tariff escalation is completely insane.,UltimateWarrior1980,2025-04-07T20:52:28,1

"Have you thought about how you're going to defend supporting the strategy to have a trade war with the entire world all at once? You honestly can't see how fucked we are? It has to be the stupidest idea in the history of macro-economics. We're going to get our asses kicked, and for what? More than half the country didn't want a trade war with anybody, and the followers are just following him, because they didn't want a trade war a month ago.  You like all that tough talk? He's signing you up for a fight you can't win!",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T21:13:34,1
Nothing like simping for a race baiting special needs senior citizen who doesn't even know you exist and wouldn't give two shits about you even if he did.   There are support groups for folks like yourself who are addicted to submissively licking the very boot that's firmly pressed against your neck.¬†   Seek one out and for the 1st time in your life you can experience what it's like to have self respect.,-StationaryTraveler-,2025-04-07T21:26:37,1
