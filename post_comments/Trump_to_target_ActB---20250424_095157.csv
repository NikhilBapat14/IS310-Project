Pay attention to this story -- if Trump succeeds it will cripple fundraising for Democratic candidates big and small. This is an attempt to use the government to make it impossible for his political opponents to compete.¬†,Xullister,2025-04-24T10:01:23,24

"In case anyone is stuck behind a paywall  ""By¬†Megan Messerly¬†and¬†Calder McHugh  04/24/2025 10:11 AM EDT  In a shot at ActBlue, the left‚Äôs major online donation platform, President Donald Trump plans to sign a presidential memorandum on Thursday cracking down on foreign contributions in American elections, according to a person familiar with the policy and granted anonymity to discuss not-yet-public details.  Attorney General Pam Bondi‚Äôs office is expected to be involved in the crackdown, the person said, though further details about the mechanism she will use were not immediately available. The order is expected to specifically target ActBlue, which Republicans have long claimed could be exploited by foreign actors.  Democrats had been bracing in recent days for potential action from the White House against the platform, casting it as an unwarranted attack on their fundraising efforts. In an¬†email to Democrats on Wednesday¬†referring to a potential coming action from the White House targeting the platform, ActBlue CEO Regina Wallace-Jones wrote, ‚ÄúNothing will deter or interrupt ActBlue‚Äôs mission and work to enable millions of Americans to participate in our democracy. There is an ongoing and persistent effort to weaken the confidence of the American people in what‚Äôs possible. This is the next version of ‚Äòthe big lie.‚Äô‚Äù  On Thursday, ActBlue told POLITICO, ‚ÄúActBlue plays a vital role in enabling all Americans to participate in our democracy and the organization strictly abides by all federal and state laws governing its activities. We will always stand steadfast in defending the rights of all Americans to participate in our democracy and ActBlue will continue its mission undeterred and uninterrupted, providing a safe, secure fundraising platform for the millions of grassroots donors who rely on us.‚Äù  Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), chair of the House Committee on Administration,¬†sent a letter to ActBlue in October¬†asking for documents and information about how the platform verifies donors, suggesting that it does not have adequate protections to prevent foreign donations.  Federal law prohibits any contributions, donations, expenditures or disbursements either directly or indirectly from foreign nationals and governments in any U.S. election, whether federal, state or local.  In December, Steil¬†announced the documents¬†turned over by ActBlue showed that the company had implemented new policies to ‚Äúautomatically reject donations that use foreign prepaid/gift cards, domestic gift cards, are from high-risk/sanctioned countries, and have the highest level of risk as determined.‚Äù At the time, Steil called it a ‚Äúpositive step forward‚Äù but said there ‚Äúis still more work to be done.‚Äù  In¬†a December press release concerning¬†the issue, ActBlue said that its ‚Äúrobust security program and strict fraud prevention measures help us rigorously protect donors‚Äô information, root out potentially unlawful foreign contributions, protect donors from financial fraud, and flag potentially unlawful or fraudulent activity.‚Äù""",Talbaz,2025-04-24T10:00:03,8
