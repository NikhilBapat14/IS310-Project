"Meanwhile the orange turd is asking the public to accept buying less and to expect ""temporary"" empty shelves, all while he continues to enrich himself and have taxpayers foot the bill for his golf trips.   Republicans were outraged that Dems where not seeing big picture with inflation, yet we didn't have looming empty shelves under Biden. Republicans are hypocrites",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-07T14:26:09,48

I barely got into this article and I’m wondering “how is there bipartisan anything given the trump regime’s actions?” It’s clear as hell MAGA sees any congress - republican or democrat - as an impediment to the regime.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-07T15:08:00,9
