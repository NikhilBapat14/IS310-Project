"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)  By Sean Cotter  The Trump administration filed its intention to appeal a federal judge’s recent decision to move the case of [Rümeysa Öztürk](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-ice-arrested/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to Vermont, according to court documents.  Court filings dated Tuesday show President Trump’s immigration enforcement officials filed a notice of appeal as well as a motion continue to keep [the Tufts PhD student](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/22/nation/ozturk-khalil-congressional-visit/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) in Louisiana pending that appeal.  [Öztürk’s](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-ice-arrested/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) case made national news over the past several weeks after video surfaced showing masked federal immigration agents arresting her outside of her apartment in Somerville. Öztürk had been in the U.S. on a student visa, but the Trump administration canceled it, arrested her, and whisked her off to a detention facility in Louisiana pending deportation. She had not known about the visa being revoked.  Last week, a federal judge in Vermont ruled that Öztürk’s case should proceed in Vermont, which was where she was being held when her lawyers first filed an appeal. The Trump administration has sought to move ahead with the case in Louisiana, where she remains.  The federal appeals court that covers Vermont is known as generally progressive, while the one that includes Louisiana is conservative, immigration lawyers have said, accusing the administration of what is known as “judge shopping.”  Öztürk has not been charged with a crime. The administration has cited an article she wrote for the student newspaper at Tufts that was critical of the university’s handling of Israel’s actions in the conflict in Gaza as the reason for her visa termination.  This comes amid a crackdown on what the Trump administration calls anti-Semitism on college campuses. The administration has canceled hundreds of student visas and moved to cut federal funding from colleges Trump paints as left-wing propagandists.",bostonglobe,2025-04-23T09:49:15,7
"It wasn't too long ago the NY Times put out an opinion piece titled, In College and Hiding From Scary Ideas. I thought it was a good read and did reflect the time frame both then and now in some leftist circles. Funny thing is conservatives praised it back then when nowadays the same article can be written about them.",Baron_Wellington_718,2025-04-23T10:25:41,2
