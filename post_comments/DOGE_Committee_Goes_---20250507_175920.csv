"As per [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-stock-trades-democrats-committee-2025-5) üì∞:  - In a hearing on Wednesday, Democrats suggested that Marjorie Taylor Greene engaged in insider trading.  - It caused the hearing to be suspended for 20 minutes.  - Greene‚Äôs trades during the April tariff dip have drawn scrutiny from Democrats.  Democrats suggested that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene engaged in insider trading at a House hearing on Wednesday, derailing the proceedings for roughly 20 minutes.  The DOGE subcommittee, which is chaired by the Georgia Republican, was holding a hearing on transgender athletes competing in fencing and other sports.  As Democrats on the panel criticized Greene, two of them ‚Äî Reps. Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett, both of Texas ‚Äî brought up recent stock trades made by the congresswoman.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here because Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks that if she picks on vulnerable people like trans folks, she can avoid having a discussion about the allegations of insider trading against her,‚Äù Casar said.  Greene purchased tens of thousands of dollars in stock in an array of companies between April 2 and 9, when President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement and subsequent pause led to large shifts in the stock market. The congresswoman has maintained that the trades were made by an independent financial advisor.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that my portfolio manager does for me, and he did a great job,‚Äù the congresswoman told the Georgia Recorder last month. ‚ÄúGuess what he did? He bought the dip.‚Äù  Democrats have argued that Greene and other Republicans close to Trump may have known about the president‚Äôs tariff moves ahead of time, allowing them to profit from non-public information.  When Crockett brought up Greene‚Äôs trades, she displayed a poster featuring the congresswoman‚Äôs face.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at fraud,‚Äù Crockett said. ‚ÄúWe could investigate whether the White House and members of this subcommittee engaged in insider trading and market manipulation. Maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence that the chairwoman brought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock the day before Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, but I guess we‚Äôll never know.‚Äù  Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina then asked to take Crockett‚Äôs words down, saying the Texas congresswoman was ‚Äúalleging a criminal act.‚Äù That led to the committee suspending its business to review Crockett‚Äôs remarks.  Eventually, Greene called the meeting back to order.  The Georgia Republican asked Mace to withdraw her motion, saying the Texas Democrat‚Äôs remarks were ‚Äúborderline‚Äù and that it was important to move on ‚Äúin the interest of making sure that we stay on track, instead of getting sidetracked by Democrats‚Äô non-stop fake accusations.‚Äù",T_Shurt,2025-05-07T18:01:28,93

"It is funny to see how they ‚Äúplay‚Äù to have democratic meetings and discussions when the one who makes  the decisions doesn‚Äôt care and his willing helpers do whatever they think he meant to do . During the Nazi regime manny lower level leaders did things they thought fucking Hitler what them to do . Example is  the admin of the occupied areas in Poland mans his area ‚Äúfree of Jews‚Äù expecting  this is hitler‚Äôs will without direct order . Same here . Suspected trans woman forced to strip to prove she is a real woman in a Boston hotel . ICE agents roaming schools and restaurants searching for immigrants . All those things feel like Germany 33-39 and they also ‚Äúplayed‚Äù to be democratic , having discussions in parliament to make it look like they have a choice . This makes me feel sick about the USA , formerly known as ‚Äúthe land of the free‚Äù",corvus66a,2025-05-08T02:39:45,1

I campaigned for no more foreign wars. And now we are supposedly on the verge of going  to war with Iran. I don't think we should be bombing foreign countries on behalf of other foreign countries especially when they have their own nuclear weapons and massive military strength.""",Green-Capital8257,2025-05-07T18:25:10,-5
