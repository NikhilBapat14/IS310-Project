It’s a lot of change. And the economy will do what it does to stimulus regardless of what you want it to do.  Things that cause growth: - deregulation  - less pressure on organizations to do productivity reducing activity  - laid off or employed workers switching to higher productivity jobs     Things that stifle growth: - uncertainty reducing investment - less labor availability (deportations)  - supply chain disruptions (tariffs)  - high interest rates (we still have them)  - less investment in R&d (nih and nsf cuts against the backdrop of the issues with universities. Long term could be okay but I think less dollars total is a problem)  -  layoffs (temporary if the jobs valuable)  - austerity - student loan collections     Things that lessen inflation: - deregulation and other supply boosting activities  - productivity growth  - high interest rates (we still have them)  - less demand (deportations ALSO cause this as do layoffs) - austerity - student loan collections    Things that increase inflation: - tariffs  - tight labor market from less labor (deportations)     It’s hard to say what the totals of all of this are for this economy. Tariffs are mostly a loser on these topics and uncertainty undermines some of the deregulation upside by stalling investment. Deportation has cost but also other benefits. Student loan collections need to happen but are growth reducing and also inflation reducing.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-07T14:26:39,24
Biden had 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Every academic low life and media personality with 10 seconds of air time fell over each other to say how it wasnt actually a recession because of employment and other stats.   How much do you guys want to bet that if Trump has two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth that this time it will be called a recession?,OliverMonster1,2025-05-07T12:47:36,13

You lost me on “deportation”.  We can immigrate legally as quickly as necessary.,n337y,2025-05-08T22:49:41,2
Them rewriting what a recession technically is during that span was incredibly telling of the state of politics in the US.,-deteled-,2025-05-07T12:53:50,18
Yes if we had a policy. We don’t. The policy appears to be anti all immigration at the moment. Have heard first hand of people near green card issuance who make tons of money and don’t do objectionable stuff being put on pause. It’s very blunt force at the moment. It’s not thoughtful coherent policy on the attracting talent side.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-05-08T23:46:54,1

"Heh, need some things to subside for a bit.  Need several million flow out then you can start immigration at scale.  The pendulum swings back hard.",n337y,2025-05-09T09:25:47,1
