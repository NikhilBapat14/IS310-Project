"Real soft gloves energy here. If the economy had negative progress with a democrat president, all news outlets would be screaming the end of the US dollar constantly.

I always expected it would take at least a year before Trump and Republicans cratered the US economy (this plus looks like deficits are exploding under Trump). I never expected they'd crater it immediately within 100 days.,jarena009,2025-04-30T08:51:41,7
">The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, weighed down by a deluge of goods imported by businesses eager to avoid higher costs, underscoring the disruptive nature of President [Donald Trump's](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) often chaotic tariff policy.  >Gross domestic product decreased at a 0.3% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP on Wednesday.  >Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that GDP increased at a 0.3% pace in the January-March period. The survey was, however, concluded before data on Tuesday showed the [goods trade](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-goods-trade-deficit-widens-sharply-march-2025-04-29/) deficit surged to an all-time high in March amid record imports, which prompted most economists to sharply downgrade their GDP estimates.  >The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the fourth quarter.  >Consumer confidence is near five-year lows and business sentiment has tanked. [Airlines](https://www.reuters.com/business/american-airlines-pulls-2025-profit-forecast-trump-tariffs-cause-demand-2025-04-24/) have pulled their 2025 financial forecasts, citing uncertainty over spending on non-essential travel because of tariffs, which economists have warned will raise costs for companies and households.",YesterShill,2025-04-30T08:48:57,3
"The crazy thing here is that through most of Q1 Trump was just engaging in tariff brinkmanship-- announcing planned tariffs, but then delaying their implementation. The main effect was actually to increase imports. However, exports were hit by retaliation from some of our trade partners.    The really high tariff rates weren't announced until April, so they literally aren't reflected at all in this report.   The way things are shaping up right now, Q2 looks like it's going to be even worse. ",Delicious_Toad,2025-04-30T09:14:44,3

"I suppose this would be Biden's fault if GDP growth had contracted during any quarter in 2024...or in 2023.  But it didn't.  So I'm confused how could Sleepy Joe (who slept all day, by one account) could be behind this. ",Professional-Law-207,2025-04-30T09:34:06,2

Were there tears in their eyes?,kafkadre,2025-04-30T08:54:26,5
"Yep. CNN was champing at the bit for a recession under Biden. Almost as soon as he took office there were non-stop talking head panels of ""Are we headed for recession?"" ""How will Biden handle a recession,"" etc. It's like they were disappointed there wasn't one.  Then last year they'd say things like, ""Why don't more people know about the good things Biden's accomplished with the economy?"" Gee, I don't know, it's too bad there's not a major cable news outlet that could talk about how he avoided that vaunted recession or brought unemployment down to 3.8-4.0 from the 8 percent he was handed.",MajorAstronaut7970,2025-04-30T09:03:11,12
