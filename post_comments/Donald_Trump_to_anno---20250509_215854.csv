">A Gulf diplomatic source, who declined to be named or disclose his position, told The Media Line, ""President Donald Trump will issue a declaration regarding the State of Palestine and American recognition of it, and that there will be the establishment of a Palestinian state without the presence of Hamas.""  I'll say the same thing I said when this was posted earlier today: this is really thin sourcing. I'll believe it when I see it.",def_indiff,2025-05-09T22:04:20,27
"I mean, I give a 5% chance of being true just because it's so insane and contradictory that it's up Trump's alley.  Maybe Saudi Arabia's Prince suggested it during a phone call.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-09T22:30:17,10

"My take is Trump is just as naive as Kushner was:  ""I can solve this whole Middle East conflict. Just establish some lines, bring in some investment, a little short-term peace keeping, and before you know it ---- boom, that Nobel Peace Prize is mine!  My guess is this ""State of Palestinian"" plan will be rejected by Palestinians as totally unworkable. Like he gave them some tiny parcel somewhere nobody wants to be and thinks they'll be grateful to be waiters and valets at some Trump-branded resort.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-09T22:42:50,5

"If this actually happens because Trump has gotten so fed up with the Israeli superiority complex, that is hilarious to me.  I just really hope people don't start supporting Israeli atrocities because Trump is moving away from them. Just to be contrarian to everything Trump does without any thought is idiotic. It would be like hating non-smokers because Hitler was against smoking.",Emila_Just,2025-05-10T00:04:09,2

"Right. So. This seems pretty unlikely.   If they did do it though, it would 1000% be a puppet regime. Think The Shah of Iran. I mean it makes sense in a nefarious way. It gives them cover to go ahead with their real estate developments and ""relocations"" under cover of a ""deal"" with the ""Palestinian government.""",sp0rkah0lic,2025-05-09T23:23:44,1

"I believe this.  Except he will probably say this Palestinian state needs to be in Egypt.  I imagine the truth social post will be something like this:  *""Palestine will have its own state. Free of the VERY bad Hamass they will have LOVELY land in Egypt while Trump turns Gaza into NEW RIVIERA with MANY beautiful hotels and casinos. People saying Trump deserves Nobel peace prize for this. Sleepy Joe Biden tried to solve this but FAILED but Trump has MADE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN.""*",thisephemerallife,2025-05-10T01:57:13,1
"Trump being the first president with a spine to tell Israel to fuck off whether for his own selfish gain or not would be historic, if he wasn't a fascist that would be someone worth supporting.
