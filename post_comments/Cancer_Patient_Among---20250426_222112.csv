Trafficked.  There is no such thing as deporting a citizen. They were human trafficked.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-26T22:49:22,1

"This really shouldn't surprise anyone.  Trumps administration has no sense of decency.  They want to meet their deportation quotas above anything else.  They believe that if they make some mistakes, that's acceptable.  With no desire to right the wrong.",Troubled202,2025-04-26T22:31:06,1

"So yah, Trump admin immigration officials also did something similar when they deported a ten year old U.S. citizen with brain cancer under threat of separating her from her relatives.  Keep in mind that the judge in this case with the 2 year old is a conservative Trump appointee, which probably won't stop Trump supporters from labeling him a ""radical leftist.""  > According to court papers, the 2-year-old girl had accompanied her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and her older sister, Valeria, to an immigration appointment in New Orleans on Tuesday when they were taken into custody by officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  So immigration officials decided to detain this little girl without any consideration for her rights, and apparently without any knowledge of her situation.   Oh ya, and the mother isn't even the girl's custodian...   > In a petition filed by the child‚Äôs custodian, Trish Mack, on Thursday, her father claimed that when he spoke briefly with Ms. Lopez Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. The father reminded her, the petition said, that ‚Äútheir daughter was a U.S. citizen and could not be deported.‚Äù  The petition said:  > The detention of V.M.L. ‚Äúis without any basis in law and violates her fundamental due process rights,‚Äù the petition said. ‚ÄúShe seeks this court‚Äôs urgent action and asks the court to order her immediate release to her custodian Trish Mack, who is ready and waiting to take her home.‚Äù  The Trump administration is just rounding up whomever they please, and without any regard for the unconstitutionality of their actions.  Just like they did with Kilmar Garcia, with a kid with cancer and with hundreds of Venezuelan migrants who were denied due process. Just like they've done with hundreds of other ""undesirables""‚Äîmany with no criminal records‚Äîthat they've been shipping in and out of Guantanamo bay; like they've done with legal residents, foreign students, visa and green card holders, veterans, protestors and U.S. citizens.   Just like they've done with asylum seekers, and foreigners who are literally hours away from obtaining their citizenship. Just like they've done with foreign workers residing in the US legally, like they've done with supposed ""gang members"" who have no actual ties to gangs. Just like they've done to migrants who have court hearings or are physically in court, like they've done with many others who have been denied their rights, stripped of their legal status, and/or permanently prohibited from accessing any avenues towards citizenship in the future...  And just like they're about to do to almost anyone who questions the current administration's actions, just like they're going to do to you or me.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-26T23:05:13,1

A mother still breast-feeding her young child was deported to Cuba on Thursday. The Mother was detained at her check-in appointment with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The child was with the Mother during the appointment and tipped from her Mother‚Äôs arms. The child remains in U.S. with the Father.   https://archive.ph/2025.04.26-235812/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article305077166.html,coffeequeen0523,2025-04-26T23:48:06,1
