Talk about universal healthcare, talk about paid parental leave, talk about protecting social security from the GOP, talk about supporting American workers and businesses, talk about fighting inflation, talk about standing against corruption, talk about the dark money that runs our political system. These are overwhelmingly popular positions, and democrats need to speak to them.   The rub: establishment democrats cant fight these things because they are owned by these very systems. Tough to run a grass-roots campaign against someone owned by Capital One. Tough to vouch for Universal Healthcare when your biggest donors are 3 different insurance companies and 4 pharma companies.

As I understand it, if the Dems had failed to pass it, and let the government shut down - then there is a legal protocol which would have allowed the White House to gut more of the departments in ways that they are being challenged in court currently.  The process once a shutdown begins has every Department send lists of their necessary employees which must be kept on during the shutdown and not furloughed.  Those lists are sent to the Office of Professional Management and the head of that department has the final decision on who is necessary, who can be terminated, etc.  The Head of OPM could override every department decision and effectively say, ""No, your entire department is unnecessary and you're laid off."" and it would be legal, whereas the terminations they've tried so far have had many challenges in court go against the administration.

Republicans pick something that will rile their base up and then shout about it from the rooftops. Democrats have a tendency to quibble about policy and focus on being technically correct rather than passionate, and in doing so often self-censor.  Democrats also have a focus issue, because they want to cover every problem that gets thrown at them, and that dilutes the power of any individual message.

They had the exit ramp when Kamala came on board.  >We have our own problems at home at the moment, where is the rest of the Arab world on this issue?   Well, Yemen and Lebanon keep being dragged into the conflict because Israel is committed toward making this a regional conflict, so I’m assuming they would like to see the Palestinian genocide end. I’m also sure they’d like to see a lot more happen to Israel, but, at that point, that’s not my problem  My problem is that the party that I was affiliated with kept using my tax dollars to fund a genocide that I wanted to see stop.

It’s not like the demands were particularly big considering that a lot of them would have been happy, at minimum, with even some slight budging on the Biden policy. Some amount of pushback would have placated this group of people, and they didn’t even want to do that whole condescending this group of voters.  And, two, I voted for Kamala. I told people to vote for Kamala. I got people to vote for Kamala. Being “you need to wait your turn” about this is rather callous when I sold out my own soul voting for the devil because I thought to myself “Well, Kamala might be a genocide merchant profiting off of a genocide abroad, but I’d rather for this group of brown people I don’t know have to be the ones that die instead of me when the trans genocide inevitably gets started up by Trump back at home if he wins.” So don’t look at me, I wanted the party to just listen to these fucking people, but that would have gone against the neoliberal status quo for them where they could continue exploiting the global south, so they lost votes along their tight margins and lost anyway 🤷‍♀️",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-24T08:35:28,1

For civil rights think the 1994 crime bill, patriot act, chuck schumer supporting the limiting of freedom of speech in relation to Israel ect.   For equity, they certainly have moved farther right on economic equity and social welfare from the previous Reagan era.
