"Trump really hates kids with cancer.  I mean, he stole from a childrens cancer charity, so who's surprised.",MrLurid,2025-04-27T17:12:16,55
"Okay, this article has more details that I haven't seen before. The child with cancer is a 4-year-old boy and he has a rare form of cancer that's in stage 4. The deportation caused him to not have access to his medicine. Hopefully he's getting treatment in Honduras. I would really like to see updates on this story... I'm so worried!  Something else important to know about these deportations of the two mothers is that in both cases, ICE didn't let the mothers contact lawyers. I read somewhere else that one mother was talking to her husband on the phone, but ICE cut off the call after less than a minute, *just when the husband was about to give his wife the phone number of a lawyer!*  And ICE made sure to deport both of these mothers and the kids quickly, so that their deportations couldn't be challenged. The speed of the deportations is an important detail. It's just like the 200+ men who were sent to El Salvador against Judge Boasberg's order. He ordered the planes to turn around and they didn't.  There's so much illegality in all these deportation cases. ICE has a lot to answer for. But the deportation of the boy with stage 4 cancer is particularly inhumane. Ripping the boy away from his home, his doctors, his treatments, and his community is something that can't be justified. There's no excuse. This doesn't make America safer.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T17:30:40,37

They probably decided that he was gonna die so why waste resources on a dying Hispanic child. Bet that was 100% part of their thinking on this case.   I wonder if there’s a picture of Reinhard Heydrich on the walls of ICE offices.,LorZod,2025-04-28T06:15:44,3
