I don't understand why this mythology of a general strike so popular on Reddit.    Countries that have general strikes are ones that have a high level of unionization because it's the unions that organize the strikes and have a strike fund to take care of people who live hand to mouth and can't afford to go for a week or more without working.   Those conditions do not exist in the United States so expecting a general strike here is like expecting a ski industry in Florida. The conditions don't exist for one.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T21:26:58,4
A general strike is never going to happen in America for at minimum 20 years. The organization doesn't exist. The unionization doesn't exist. The political engagement doesn't exist. The leadership doesn't exist.,DisMFer,2025-04-29T23:33:52,2

I've been in six protests against Trump so far. And 80% of the people at these protests have been boomers.   I've had several arguments in the last few days here on Reddit Politics with non-boomers who made all kinds of excuses why they can't participate in the protests.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T21:28:35,8
