"Because Democrats don’t have a platform, a movement, or a leader - what is there to support?  I’m an easily winnable voter for Democrats. I have always been decidedly opposed to Trump and MAGA and I don’t have any sort of ideological purity test that would prevent me from voting for candidates who don’t agree with me on everything.   Yet, it’s impossible to call myself a Democrat because I don’t know what the hell *they* even think they are; they are entirely rudderless and have been since the end of Obama.   Democrats need to stop being so afraid to piss people off and leave people out - you can’t actively include and represent everyone. Get a point of view, find the right messenger, and put it out there and quick because once Trump is gone, the anti-Trump vote is also going to be in peril.",atxlrj,2025-05-06T13:51:10,19

Democrats can't embrace economic populism so long as their votes and their money come from two different groups.  Both parties represent the monied class and the functional role of the Democratic Party is to placate the working class while delivering as little as possible.

"Democrats aren’t benefitting because they aren’t doing anything coherent to meaningfully resist Trump. To a degree, they’re limited in what they can do in a Republican trifecta, but by and large, all they’ve done is whine.   Most of them are complaining and hand wringing, some are writing op-eds about “the end of Democracy” and “this isn’t the America I love.” Others are preaching to the choir in CNN or MSNBC interviews.   Some are even trying little solo act demonstrations like Senate filibusters or visiting wrongfully deported prisoners, but it doesn’t feel like doing anything. It just reeks of self-aggrandizement and trying to jockey for promotions to the Senate, governor’s mansion, 2028 presidential nomination, etc.   There’s no rallying cry for unity coming from anywhere in the party.

"Dems don’t often have punchy catch phrases but for any voter who really cares, they shouldn’t need those. A good example of what Dems stand for is a story from NPR that I heard on the radio yesterday and that was posted in article form on here earlier. Trump just defunded a big national fire academy in PA or MD, I can’t remember which, that is highly regarded for the quality of firefighters it produces and that also is a huge boost to the local economy. They interviewed a Trump voter who was an instructor at the academy or something and he said he’s disappointed because the decision is impacting him financially but also could be disastrous for firefighting all across the country without recruits receiving high quality training.   This funding was never in question when Dems were writing budgets. Dems want highly trained firefighters, and they want funding for dozens or even hundreds of other institutions that Trump is eviscerating. Is funding these institutions progressive and/or sexy and does it all come with a catch phrase? No, not really. But this is really important stuff and unfortunately a lot of people may not realize that until it’s gone. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-06T14:06:18,3

"As an independent I've been looking over the democratic candidates and their general message has been chaotic.  There's no universal message overall and they need to get it together. First of all, the only thing Trump and his people have probably done right is using social platforms and media to gain a following and find the general message from its base. Unfortunately, that turned out to be distrust in our government and some was the culture around DEI.  They turned that into their own message and continued to feed into that idea.  Not necessarily because they intended on using it for good reasons, which obviously we can see that clearly, but for their own.  So, I think democrats need do the same.  They need to listen to us Americans and find that one common concern that's driving everyone and use it. ",arilupe,2025-05-06T14:22:17,6

"You just revealed a fundamental issue Democrats don’t even know they are facing - “the funding was never in question”.   The whole budget slashing thing is a prime example of this tension for me. People see the hatchet job that DOGE and Musk and Trump are doing and they may not agree with many decisions or the approach as a whole - but they look at Democrats and see that “they don’t even question anything”.   Democrats have been too slow on the uptake and too protective of the status quo. They project a sense of intellectual superiority that comes off as dismissive of the real concerns and questions that voters have.   Voters who may have serious doubts about DOGE cuts feel even less comforted by Democrats who flatly dismiss any reason to question whether budgets should ever be cut at all. You may disagree with Trump’s solutions, but you feel like you’re not even allowed to ask the question to Democrats; or worse, will be laughed at or mocked for even thinking about it.  Funding specialized firefighter training classes isn’t a platform. Cutting government spending is. Again, this isn’t a specific decision I agree with, but Democrats focusing on criticizing this decision falls flat with me because they don’t have any point of view about budgets and spending as a whole.  It isn’t unique to this issue - across many domains (the border is a great example), voters feel like Trump has imperfect or even stupid solutions, but they feel like Democrats aren’t even engaging with the questions and concerns that are out there. They tell you “everything is fine, Trump is bad, and you’re stupid for thinking that there is anything wrong with budgets or the border”.   It’s not a winning message and it’s not a platform, unless their platform is “the status quo”.",atxlrj,2025-05-06T14:24:46,3

You work you get healthcare. Americans are one layoff away from healthcare and one health disaster away from financial ruin.  Come back to me when you can get single payer healthcare through congress.  You work you can have a family if you want. Haha right with that minimum wage job?

The border and immigration are issues that I feel voters are most justified in being upset with Dems about. Immigration doesn’t bother me personally, but even moderate Dems were answering polls saying it mattered to them and doing very little to stop the flow into the country through the border simply doesn’t make a ton of sense.   With most other issues, I’m frankly baffled as to the positions voters take on them. Tariffs, who on earth thinks that’s a good idea? Defunding everything and anything even though these institutions do a ton of good for Americans and have kept us as the global superpower and shotcaller on the world stage since WW2. Why does frustration with Dems for not caring a ton about deficit spending justify cutting training for firefighters, programs that help pay rent for older veterans, over the phone assistance with social security benefits etc? Not only does cutting these programs harm all of the beneficiaries, who are just average American people trying to get by, but it also doesn’t even remotely tackle the deficit and debt. Probably have to hike taxes and make changes to Medicare and Medicaid to really make an impact on federal spending.   So yeah, Dems are losing the messaging war and that’s not good and needs to change, but a big chunk of their platform -supporting productive, helpful institutions - is a decent platform and should be enough to defeat Trump. Another frustrating thing is that voters say they’re crying out for big change, but it’s a Herculean task to get them and Republicans to support things like minimum wage increases, workers’ rights like union support, and movement toward universal healthcare. Voters want change but they can’t decide what sort of change they actually want and instead have consciously chosen Trump, the guy who is the clear greater evil and is obviously only going to make virtually every issue many voters care about far worse. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-06T16:57:39,1

No you misunderstand. This is gonna be like a 30-50 seat swing.   They would have to overturn midterms themselves at that point. They couldn’t pick off a few people here and there with lawsuits.  8-9 is the amount they can’t afford to lose or they lose the House.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-06T13:43:45,2
And who's to say they can't overturn midterms themselves? I'd say there's a chance the 2026 election doesn't even happen.,Burner_Account_14934,2025-05-06T13:47:46,1
What do you mean 30-50 seat swing? In favor of Dems? How is that even realistic?,rickylancaster,2025-05-06T13:55:28,1
"It’s not gonna happen.  The economy is gonna be a disaster. They’re gonna want to dump this on the Democrats to fix as soon as possible.  Republicans care above all about themselves. If they pull a stunt like that, they crash the dollar, destroy American superiority, likely balkanize large parts of the country and lose a shit ton of power and comfort.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-06T13:53:00,2
