"Summary (from the new Pew Research survey):  ""Around eight-in-ten Americans say the United States should provide medicine and medical supplies, as well as food and clothing, to people in developing countries. Roughly six-in-ten believe the U.S. should give aid that supports economic development and helps strengthen democracy in other nations. There is less support, however, for providing military aid or funding art and cultural activities.""  This restores my faith in the US public's concern for helping other nations in need, for humanitarian reasons as well as a good faith gesture that improves the US' standing with other nations.  I hope and pray that the US public will strongly express their beliefs, and their revulsion at the hateful, cruel and unannounced termination of global US Aid that was done on the orders of President Musk and King Trump. Throw the bastards (Republicans) out in 2026!",Nerd-19958,2025-05-02T23:43:07,5
"Good to hear, but how do you get the attention of our elected officials?  The majority of Americans want also want. Clean water.  Good economy. A fair justice system.  Support for science and considering actual science in policy making.  Our standing as a nation. Respect for others. A president that isn’t a facist.",skeevev,2025-05-02T23:57:45,4
"The Right: “We should spend that money to help Americans, not foreigners!”     The Left: “So we could help people with M4A, free school lunches, and cheaper tuition?”     The Right: “FUCK NO!”",FreneticPlatypus,2025-05-03T05:34:12,3
