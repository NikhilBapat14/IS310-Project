This will be a Republican recession. Republicans are fully complicit.,Motorbarge,2025-05-01T23:30:14,32
"Trumpty Dumpty land had a great fall. Even if he removed tariffs tomorrow the damage to the US has already been done.   Investor confidence , particularly international , has been eroded to the point that it will crumble and never return.  The US is now a dysfunctional failed state and is being raped by a six time bankrupt felon who has smashed the constitution with his attacks on the rule of law.  It is widely held that one of the major contributing factors to the fall of the Roman Empire was rampant corruption and mistrust of institutions.  Parallels abound and this has occurred within his first 100 days of a four year term.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-01T23:49:00,19

"Isn't this exactly how the GOP prefers to ""govern?""  Break everything that government actually did or does for the benefit of regular folks, then replace it with ""alternatives"" designed to fail - first to eliminate all government services, then to (try to) gaslight Americans into thinking the GOP isn't  just a bunch of ""nattering nabobs of negativism"", as Agnew might have put it.",phosdick,2025-05-02T07:29:35,1

"I keep forgetting chatbots are a thing, the number of times my SO has said to me ""bb, that's a bot..."" is a nonzero number.   I've grown up with the internet and they're not exactly *new*, they just weren't so ubiquitous. You'd think it'd be in a web host's best interest to prevent bots from free roaming, rather they just make it more difficult for a regular person on mobile to browse.

I assume all Trump supporting minorities are bots. There was that one white dude MAGA who forgot to switch accounts and posted under his female minority account. Iâ€™m sure there is more than one MAGA supporter doing this. Itâ€™s like Elonâ€™s alt accounts praising him for being a good father.,idoma21,2025-05-03T23:39:58,1
