She needs to primary Chuck Schumer.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-05T15:30:27,27
"The DNC needs to choose her as their candidate for president.   Naturally the alt-right and MAGAverse will completely lose their minds but she is the only one who actually has balls when none of the Democrats do.   She could take up that fight and win them the presidency.   Naturally they would have to tolerate some of the other things that come with this package, such as socialized medicine and affordable education and whatnot.  I know, I know.... Ewww yuk according to a portion of the American population. But it would do wonders for America.  Choose AOC 👍🏻",sniffstink1,2025-05-05T15:36:21,9
"You mean she's not accommodating the ravenous feeding frenzy of the beltway press desperate to have something to talk about less than a year after the last general election. I really get offended when these people that regularly attend the WHPCD pretend that their own daily Game-of-Thrones dramas are what the actual populace is dwelling on. I'm also annoyed at any implication that its unreasonable to be silent on a 2028 run in 2025. Any insinuation that normal people are waiting on tenterhooks for any one individual and biting their nails is pure projection.  Cool your fucking JETS on future elections, 'journalists'! Something has to actually happen for you to ""journal"" it, right? Otherwise you're just waxing poetic about possible futures.  I've got an idea -- the current president is up to quite a bit. Did you notice? Go cover some of it! I guarantee you that AOC is more worried about that right now, herself. Nobody owes you an ""announcement"" three years out, so I give you permission to peel your eyes off of that concern for a few seconds.",Lurlex,2025-05-05T15:41:59,2
a democratic primary where a waitress goes up against a billionaire would be so symbolic. I wonder how the democratic establishment will explain to us dummies why we need a billionaire over a member of the working class.  edit: letter,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-05T15:23:04,3
"Narrator: only DC insiders are ""in suspense.""  the rest of us, the actual voters, are happy that she is taking her job as a public servant to heart and working hard at it. What she does next is later. Now? She's out there fighting.  Report on what she is fighting not what DNC party wonks are whispering about.",kokopelleee,2025-05-05T16:04:55,4
"Nobody really cares what she decides, at this point.  There will be plenty of time for this later. This whole 1 election done and on to the next is what tires people out.",Idredric,2025-05-05T15:32:40,1

Stay tuned!  She is probably the only Democrat that knows how to use Trump tactics but for liberal causes.,dbag3o1,2025-05-05T15:33:07,1
Fuck you Hill. She's keeping the momentum going. Not everything has to become a run for office. Maybe she will run for something... Maybe not. We don't fucking care about your news scoops. Now get back to reporting about our fucking dictator. Or have you lost your balls on that?,williamgman,2025-05-05T16:01:12,1
I would love for her to run for president but I don't see any way that center/center right liberals would support her. They would have fascism than anything that looks like socialism.,duffys4lyf,2025-05-05T16:06:32,1
"Yeah, it's either Senate or President. She has to pick one since they're both in 2028. Going to be interesting to see how this plays out.",Scarlettail,2025-05-05T15:25:42,0
As long as she doesn’t run for a president. I’m all for equal rights. If democrats have not learned anything from both Hillary and Kamala’s loss they won’t learn anything. Deep down America is still too conservative to elect a female president.,Justthetippliz,2025-05-05T15:31:07,-4

"I'd prefer Schumer to be gone before 2028.    > Schumer, a 74-year-old who has held his seat representing New York since 1999, is up for reelection in 2028, and he’s facing criticism over his leadership and Democrats’ response to the Trump administration. Ocasio-Cortez strongly pushed back against him for voting to advance the recent GOP-crafted funding bill.  >  > Democratic strategist Fred Hicks suggested she’s “laying the groundwork for the Senate,” through the recent moves that appear to some as presidential hints. Amid party tensions, Hicks said, it may be a better move for her to generate chatter about a possible presidential run “and then pivot to the Senate.” He pointed to the recent conflict after Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chair David Hogg’s group launched an effort to spend big on primary challenges against House Democrats in safe blue seats.  >  > “The DNC and Democratic power structure … has outright stated its opposition to incumbents being Primaried. With that in mind, if AOC is considering a run against Schumer, at THIS time, it is best for her to create chatter for another office, get her footing, and then pivot,” Hicks said in a text message. >",tech57,2025-05-05T15:34:33,2
"Sadly, that's about four years from now.  It's 2028, meaning she wouldn't be able to run for President *or* Governor.  And I kinda think her best move might be to go for Governor.  I mean, that's me wish-casting because I'd like a Governor candidate I'd be willing to vote for (and Hochul ain't it - never again with her crypto-Republican ass), but it'd also give her some executive experience to round out her resume so that when she does run for President, nobody can say she isn't ""qualified.""  Waiting until 2028 just to maybe become a junior Senator who'd then need to spend time in the Senate to fulfil that obligation is pointless.  Honestly if she isn't gonna run for Governor, I'd rather her just run for President in 2028 straight-away.",FrostPDP,2025-05-05T16:00:30,1
"Better would be if she, and other prominent Democrats, could talk sense into Schumer and the rest of the Been There Too Long crowd and convince them that their time to lead has come and gone.  Yes, all in for Future President AOC to replace Schumer but, it would be best if it can be done without creating battles within the party.",GoDucks71,2025-05-05T15:34:15,0

"I would rather having an actual primary and the dnc listening to voters instead of selecting candidates, that's how you turn off a lot of voters. And yes this includes other politicians falling in line with a candidate before or in the middle of primaries   Irregardless if you or I want AOC, we have to let the process play out the right way.  And to add to this, AOC would be great as a leader of the party in Congress. Not saying I don't think she could win the presidency , but I foresee an uphill battle as Dems haven't had luck with women so far.",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-05T15:45:44,8
"It's a really nice narrative, but AOC is a US Congress person now. She waitressed while she was in school just like Biden was a lifeguard when he was in school, but no one would call Biden a lifeguard after being in the government for years.",thrawtes,2025-05-05T17:07:33,1

"Senate seems like the smart move to me. But then again she won her seat when she was 29 and has become a major player in the party. When I was 29, I was sleeping under my desk at work because I was so hungover. So she probably shouldn't take advice from me.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-05-05T15:41:12,2

I'm also not sure that AOC even wants to be president. She's really dedicated to her district so I could see her moving up the ranks in Congress for sure.,emslynn,2025-05-05T15:52:22,2

"I do not care at all about any politician's hurt feelings.  I care about trying not to drive anyone away from supporting better candidates and if the Dems clean house via the Republican method of primarying people who they want out, rather than exerting a strong push peior to that, I fear the Dems will break the party into warring groups, resulting in the loss of seats to the Republicans.",GoDucks71,2025-05-05T16:17:01,0
"Yes, I am aware of David Hogg's plan to primary Democratic office-holders.  But, to me, what is needed is for him to recruit some of the powers that be in the party to exert a much harder shove than he can render on his own.  I thought a lot of the blame for the Democrats trying to hide Biden's condition and sneak him into a second term belonged to the big names in the party.  Obama and the two Clintons, in addition to others, should have been pressuring him hard, not only not to run, but to step down. The same is true now.  That group needs to shove Schumer and others, for instance my own very good former rep and now Senator, Ron Wyden, to step aside and let the next generations have their chance.  I say this as a 76-year-old myself.",GoDucks71,2025-05-05T15:59:46,0
"I think AOC is smart enough to know that Hillary and Kamala did not win. I think AOC knows that Trump won both of those times. I think AOC knows she can run for President at a later time.   AOC has 3 years to rally all the not-Republicans to vote for a Democrat. Who that is isn't terrible important. >  > Schumer, a 74-year-old who has held his seat representing New York since 1999, is up for reelection in 2028, and he’s facing criticism over his leadership and Democrats’ response to the Trump administration.

"> But, to me, what is needed is for him to recruit some of the powers that be in the party to exert a much harder shove than he can render on his own.  Let's pretend for a moment that you are not the first person with this idea and that it has been tried for the past 10 odd years. What next?    If the powers that be in the Democrat party wanted progress... they have had plenty of time.    >“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs.
