"As we’ve reported, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty gave the soft treatment to a government employee who keyed Teslas—to the tune of $21K in damage—but charged another women with a first-degree felony for doing the same thing to a car that wasn’t a Tesla (even though the damage was only $6K in that case).
