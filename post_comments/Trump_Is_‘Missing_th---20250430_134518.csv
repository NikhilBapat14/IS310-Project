Understatement of the year.. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-30T13:54:24,15
I literally don't understand how Latinos are confused by him doing what he campaigned on.  Have these people never talked to any maga people in real life? WTF do they think Trump would do? I'm honestly confused what they thought was going to happen when he campaigned on hating them and got elected.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T13:50:36,12
"Wait, ""Missing the mark"" as in the idea that he doesn't intend to keep any of them in the country or the idea that he should have policies that he promised to those voters?",thieh,2025-04-30T13:49:59,7
Literally doesn’t matter. Hispanic men shifted heavily to the right this last election. If they couldn’t see exactly what was going to happen that’s on them. They’re in the find out stage.,TDeath21,2025-04-30T14:12:25,7
Both Trump and DeSantis won Miami-Dade county which is one of the most hispanic dominated counties indicating Hispanic voters bought in their campaign promises.   It's same situation in South Texas (many hispanic dominated areas) which Trump and Ted Cruz won in 2024 elections.,Plastic_Ad_1106,2025-04-30T13:57:41,6
"...   No, I do believe he's hitting the mark he's aiming for dead center bullseye.   Or did they think he wasn't serious when he said he would deport them all?",Nekowulf,2025-04-30T13:50:37,4
"Well, I can't fathom why a Latino would ever vote for him.",nonamenolastname,2025-04-30T14:05:21,3
What are they upset about? He’s doing what he said he would do. Did you think voting for a racist asshole would work out well for Latinos?,hmr0987,2025-04-30T14:52:00,3

"Oh yeah, if he just tweaked his messaging then expelling brown people from the U.S. en masse would look really reasonable. GTFOH",ufotheater,2025-04-30T14:21:58,1
Trump 101:  “they can’t vote if they are deported”,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-30T14:28:34,1
No I'd say he's got them locked down.,ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-30T18:16:01,1
"Lol that was my first thought! Seriously, I have heard nothing from of my lation trump coworkers the past month. They never talk about him and avoid the topic of politics like the plague now",Sir_Ruje,2025-04-30T14:26:00,2
"Much of trump's attacks on Latinos in his second term are no different than what trump did to them in his first term. They knew what they were getting, they were just too sexist to vote for a woman. Just like in 2016.",SeductiveSunday,2025-04-30T14:12:49,6

"To be fair, if they voted, they’re probably legal citizens and have a life/career in America. I busted my ass to get resident status in Canada and I would be upset by fellow Americans skirting the system. This situation is much more nuanced, but I would also be curious the percentage of Hispanic citizens being directly affected by this policy. Much like the people that googled “tariffs” AFTER the election.",SpecialEdShow,2025-04-30T14:51:25,2
"I don’t understand the fuss, he’s doing EXACTLY what he said he would do.",SpecialEdShow,2025-04-30T14:46:32,2
Latinos are majorly catholic and conservative. Just like Muslims. These groups voted blue because they were spurned by the old republican establishment. Trump gave them false hope that they would be accepted by his maga cult.,Momonsterz,2025-04-30T14:18:21,5
"Interestingly, this poll shows that among Latinos who voted for Trump, more believe he’s “not gone far enough” than “gone too far.”",Ok-Conversation2707,2025-04-30T13:59:07,1
"And yet Mexico elected a female President.  I suspect their issue with Kamala had to do with her race, not her gender.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-04-30T23:58:55,1
"Here's the thing, though (and anybody paying attention already knew this): the right is NOT conservative - they are radically reactionary. No one can hate ""others"" - read anyone but white, protestant and, preferably, male - more or harder than the MAGA right. Latinos and Muslims may not *like* the left but,*at worst*, they don't have to *fear* the left. They've made a deal with the devil and I'm finding it harder and harder to sympathize with them. They need to come back or suffer their choice.",barneyrubbble,2025-04-30T14:30:11,3
I think the US is more sexist than Mexico. Mexico has enacted laws to which has led the country to become less sexist while the US is has recently overturned Constitutional rights and now Republicans plan to overturn the 19th amendment which is increasing sexism along with loss of rights for women.  I'm sure racism was also involved too.,SeductiveSunday,2025-05-01T09:38:36,2
I think it was mostly religious views. Trump uses religion as a political tool to manipulate people. Dude isn't even religious.,JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-01T00:56:49,1
