Seeing as the party in opposition historically always tend to do well in midterms and seeing the republicans slim majority of 220 seats i'd say its almost guaranteed that democrats regain the house in 2026. With republicans in full control they will ultimately cary the blame for everything that is not going well that matter to voters in 2026. I also don't think there will be much redistricting either.,jarreddit123,2025-03-08T20:58:58,301
"Well, there were a lot of young people coming of age to vote in the last election, and a lot of people sat on their asses. We see where that got us. I can't remember the exact numbers but they said a ton of eligible Democrat voters sat out this time and did not vote. This is what happens. So perhaps, who knows, if the orange donut literally drags the country into Oblivion in the next two years, that might be enough to get people to skip their Pilates class to go vote.

Theres a reasonable likelihood. The GOP only has a 5 seat majority with 2 seats (and an expected 3rd) coming up for special elections in 2025. If they lose both seats that comes down to 1 seat majority and if the 3rd seat is vacated and lost it would become a 1 seat Democrat majority before the mid-terms even happen.,SorryToPopYourBubble,2025-03-08T21:10:53,26

So the Senate map right now looks very friendly to the Republicans despite the fact that they're defending 22 Senate seats. The only seed I could see them potentially losing is Maine North Carolina is also on there but it's one of those states that might elect Democrats locally but I don't think would ever elect one federally. Georgia the Democrats currently hold but the very popular Governor is a term Limited he also has a hell of a political machine down there. The Republicans also have Elon to fund their races. He also replaces Mitch McConnell something I'm sure Ted Cruz is very happy about. I'll say the Republicans pick up Georgia and hold the rest although that is incredibly optimistic. For the house really hard to predict I would say maybe Republicans go back into opposition but if it's a good night for them in the Senate more than likely it's going to be an okay to great night in the house. Trump being popular and actually having a semi decent approval rating really throws us all into speculation.,Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-03-08T23:25:29,1

In the 2022 midterm election deniers and January 6th apologists did poorly. Many Trump backed candidates lost and polling showed the public didn't want Trump to run again.

Let’s say you suspend common sense and say Trump isn’t just grifting but actually has a long term plan where he crashes the economy on purpose in order to come out stronger in the long run. We’ll likely be at the bottom of that plan in 2026 and voters will be looking to punish someone.

"When the Democratic Party finds a way to convince those - all of those - who feel socially and economically marginalized that they are heard and respected - democrats will regain power in Congress - but only as long as economic forces are in their favor. “IT’S THE ECONOMY STUPID. “ Then they have to deliver relief in the form of increased opportunity, not increased government assistance.   The GOP isn’t wrong about everything, but are wrong about conflating government and business. They are completely different animals with radically different missions. You can’t measure the success of each by the other’s yardstick. Corruption is the inevitable consequence. … more corruption.   Increased corruption is a real concern and myopic vision.   The aging global population is a main cause of sociopolitical change and instability in the 21st century. The ratio of the needs of the aging population to the cumulative productivity of the young will probably result in economic decline and global hardship. There are fewer producers, but more and more mouths to feed. Declining tax revenues and increasing cost of care. Some are in a panic. This is what increasing restrictions on abortion are about and why many countries allowed increased immigration. (We need immigration reform here with paths to citizenship.) I think we will adapt and survive as we always have. New technologies will mitigate some pain.   Meanwhile - I think there needs to be an open honest discussion in this country about this reality.   One consequence is that women, who entered the workforce by the millions in the 1970s+ dramatically increasing production, can’t return to the homemaker roles that some subcultures are campaigning for. Moving forward there will be more worker shortages requiring every one of working age to be employed. Women will thus continue to be less inclined to have children perpetuating the aging population crisis. It’s a complex problem.   The phenomenon of ‘retirement’ as we understand it is less than 100 years old and will have to be amended. Healthy lifestyles and age span will be a focus. Retirement age will shift to 70 or later.

Overall turnout will probably be around or less than 50%.  It's a matter of who is part of that 50%.  The GOP holds the House by a slim margin.  Moreso than is typical of Republican candidates, Trump was able to win over voters who typically don't vote otherwise.  So many of his supporters may sit it out in 2026, allowing that gap to be filled by opponents of Trump and the GOP.  Given all of this, the House is within striking distance of being flipped if the Dems avoid blowing it with their own messaging.  But knowing the Dems, they will find a way to blow it.

"Normally I would say near 100% chance as the party in power ""USSUALLY"" lose seats in the house during a off year election and since it is a slimmer majority than usual, it should be a lock.  Problem is almost all demographics have been shifting slightly more conservative over time since around the time of Obama as he took one giant step to the left of recent Democratic presidents.  Think Clinton much more conservative, pro business etc. even President Carter before him looks like a right winger next to Obama.   The Democrats have not really learned this lesson think Adam Schiff, AOC, Nancy Pelosi and the like they are all falling over each other trying to get even further left though  the party has been trotting out slightly more centrists such as Sen.

Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party used the incident to justify a massive crackdown on political opposition, consolidate power, and dismantle democratic institutions. Metaphorically, a “Reichstag fire” event refers to a crisis—real, exaggerated, or manufactured—that a leader exploits to expand their power and undermine democratic norms.”  And look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistleblowers/s/fnonlftUg3) letter.

She didn't run on that. She *barely* brought up LGBT issues at all - in my opinion, to her detriment. Trans issues aren't exactly winning ""kitchen table issues"", but most Americans DO support same-sex marriage and making a clear-cut case that Republicans could not be trusted on it probably could've pushed some people over. She also didn't do that.  >Democrats have tried to be Republican-lite for three election cycles? Is that a joke?   Lol no, not whatsoever.  >Kamala has the most Progressive Democratic nominee in history.  She objectively wasn't. Basically straight up adopted Trump's 2020 immigration platform, declined to support Lina Khan and other pro-worker Feds, didn't picket with a union, and muzzled Tim Walz. You don't actually have a fucking argument on this, because the idea that she was ""the most progressive democratic nominee in history"" is nothing more than a thought-terminating right-wing cliche, not something supported by any actual evidence - because the evidence clearly shows that Joseph Robinette Biden, who didn't dance on stage with Liz Cheney (a warmongering, anti-LGBT Republican), was to Kamala's left.

Not ""genociding the transes"" but a pretty clear deployment of government violence against people out and trans, which is breathtakingly shitty.  See right here, more hyperbole, ala “government violence”. Like just listen to yourself. Kids should not be stuffed with hormones during the most confusing and critical developmental point of their entire lives, it’s very simple. No one serious is arguing against adults making their own choices to be trans or not and to live their lives. But leave the fucking kids alone, it’s not unreasonable whatsoever and there’s good evidence against the practice which is why other countries are increasingly scaling back or outlawing the practice. American institutions have been ideologically captured by this political issue and it’s glaringly obvious to anyone with half a brain when you compare their guidelines vs other countries who have commissioned studies on this. Beyond the kids and sports, no one gives a shit besides some people bitching about the bathroom stuff, which honestly wasn’t so stacked against trans people until Progressives started to jump the shark with all of the other hysterical bullshit that turned off the public.   > And then, post-election, MSNBC hosts were wondering if ""Democrats were too focused on the trans people"" when Harris quite deliberately downplayed them pretty significantly, which suggests... you're lying, and engaging in bad faith, which is par for the course for people crying about the woman dancing around on stage with Liz Cheney as being ""too far left"".  Oh please. Harris being so silent on the issue was exactly the problem. Everyone saw what happened under the Biden administration which she was a part of, and everybody remembered her previous stances on tax payer funded gender reassignment surgery and more ridiculous bullshit she was pressured into endorsing by activist groups like GLAAD. Her being silent was seen by most as a tacit endorsement of what had been occurring rather than firmly standing against it. Who’s engaging in bad faith here exactly lmao?  > no dispute, and understandably so. it also just isn't an issue that the Federal government needs to rule on. this is the definition of a state-by-state issue.  Sure they can and should. The Fed should be empowered to enact a pro-choice legal floor that all states must abide by, and they should be empowered to put a ceiling on the excesses of the trans activist movement.  > I'm not failing to accept that, I agree with that, I just also recognize that it was never an issue, you're just pointing to it because you don't actually have an argument rooted in any actual polling data or facts, so you have to run to your safe space which is ""but but but THE TRANSWOMEN IN SPOOOOORTS!"" which, again, no one argued - including Kamala fuckin' Harris, dude.  See right here, you’re deluding yourself. Obviously it was an issue. Insisting it wasn’t and closing your eyes and ears shut does you zero favors. The “Kamala is for they/them” ad by the Trump campaign alone shifted the needle by 2.7 fucking points. It was an enormous part of the campaign in general and they rode it to the first popular vote victory in decades, and that’s after knowing how shitty and incompetent Trump was in his first term. He should have been easily beaten, but Biden and Harris were both too incompetent and too weak to forcefully counter the narrative he made for them and that voters followed. Hilarious how you accuse me of having no data or facts, as if 1) those are the be-all, end-all of decision making and reaching conclusions and 2) fail to provide any of your own.  > She didn't run on that. She barely brought up LGBT issues at all - in my opinion, to her detriment. Trans issues aren't exactly winning ""kitchen table issues"", but most Americans DO support same-sex marriage and making a clear-cut case that Republicans could not be trusted on it probably could've pushed some people over. She also didn't do that.

And why are we trying to act like her 2019 primary run doesn’t exist?

But, I don't expect honesty from people who earnestly make that claim, I expect lies.  Wow, you really force yourself to forget about the price controls and other positions she held huh? How the fuck was she to Biden’s right?

The only people here going off of the data are the people who have looked at it, e.g, not you. Americans are pretty favorable towards progressive policies. Universal healthcare, not being bigots to gay people, at LEAST 12-weeks of abortion access, labor unions, free public college, parental leave, mail-in voting, free school breakfast and lunch, climate action, etc.  Lmao ohhh how funny, another example of Progressives trying to steal long held Liberal policies and pass them off as their own. It’s amazing how Progressives never seem to realize their policies are far more popular than the people. Yeah the Progressive policies of Defund the Police and Israel Should Not Exist were super fucking popular and won over huge swathes of people. Progressives spend way more time talking about social issue bullshit rather than being the economic populists that may actually give them a shot politically. To me, this reeks of being far too incompetent to do the job. You realize many of these *concepts* are popular, but that there’s no real viable execution, right? Universal healthcare as a concept is fucking awesome, but why has no one produced and pushed a viable plan that we could actually implement and afford? Same with free higher education. Free community college could be viable, but free four years degrees for everyone who wants one? Lmao, yeah good luck with that, let’s see how popular the actual policies that would be implemented are.  > If Democrats want to win, they have to offer something other than the one-speed neoliberal pro-corporate policies that you nincompoops insist are the only way to beat the Republicans even though you've lost now two of the last three elections to the worst fucking candidate that has ever had to be run against.  Your morons are the one who have derailed any hope of actual policy change with your wildly unpopular social rhetoric that turns off anyone who may otherwise be a supporter of radical policy changes.

"The reason 2020 is an outlier isn’t just about raw numbers, it’s about why those numbers were so high. The pandemic fundamentally changed how people voted, with mass mail-in ballots and expanded early voting driving turnout to historic levels. That kind of shift doesn’t just carry over automatically.  As for the drop in votes between 2020 and 2024, it actually proves the point. The Democratic turnout in 2020 was inflated by a perfect storm of circumstances—COVID, Trump’s presidency polarizing the electorate, and a massive push for easier access to voting. In 2024, with Trump still a major factor but no pandemic-driven voting expansion, turnout dropped more on the blue side. That doesn’t negate 2020 being an outlier—it reinforces it.  And let’s not pretend the GOP was unaffected. Republican turnout also fell, just not by as much. That’s because Trump was still at the top of the ticket, and his base is more locked in. Meanwhile, some Democrats who showed up in 2020 because they were terrified of another Trump term weren’t as fired up in 2024.

Here, I'll provide it even though you were unwilling to do the same, in good faith, to support your affirmative claims:  14 international, peer-reviewed studies of transgender, gender-affirming care for minors and the effects on their mental health before and after the studies: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202201/the-evidence-trans-youth-gender-affirming-medical-care  Here's a peer-reviewed meta-study of 44 peer-reviewed studies looking at parental involvement in their minor's transgender journey: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10567-021-00344-6  Here's a study indicating that, out of the sample size of ~27,000, about  90% of the people who *received* gender affirming care continued to identify as their *chosen* gender identity - and that of those who detransitioned, *unsupportive family* was a common factor: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/lgbt.2020.0437  Here's a study showing that postponement of gender-affirming care was associated with greater likelihood of depression and suicidal ideation: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00139-5/fulltext  ...and a survey of ~21,000 adults who found that, *of the ~40% of them* who *received* gender-affirming care, this subgroup had a nearly 60% drop in said suicidal ideations and depressive thoughts: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261039  To the contrary, the evidence seems pretty clear that intervention is good and necessary when indeed it's warranted - which is in just a *vanishingly* small minority of cases, which begs the question why you care so much.

"> None of your reasoning here is very logical. Obviously a relatively new figure in the party is going to struggle against long established leaders in a primary. It was the shortest Presidential campaign in history, with just 107 days from announcement to election, which has never been done before and would have been a challenge for any candidate. Plenty of reasons to explain the results that are far more convincing than a simple-minded ""she sucks.""  All of this is just pure nonsense. Plenty of newcomers have beaten out established party candidates. The public likes fresh, new energy, generally. Look at Obama or Trump. They destroyed their party’s respective established leaders. The short campaign saved her from a bigger blow out. Kamala’s favorability dropped the more she had the spotlight and had noticeably decreased from the initial burst of enthusiasm that was totally real and not inorganically manufactured. Even going by your logic, Kamala struggled against a host of other new people in the primary who were operating under the same supposed disadvantage as she was.  > Meanwhile she didn't just win the debate, she utterly shellacked him, baiting and manipulating, talking circles around him until by the end he was choking mad and shouting about Haitians eating people's pets  She did better than him, but it wasn’t exactly a massive curb stomp that everyone will always remember, calm down lmao   > all while pushing one of the most progressive platforms in Democratic Party history.

I think she would have been more competent than Trump by many measures, but I also believe she would have pushed the same fucking status quo most of society has grown to find intolerable. She offered no real vision or path forward to change that reality. Trump is a chaotic, idiotic upending of the traditional system of institutions society has grown disillusioned with and distrustful of, but he embodies the core frustration so many citizens on both sides of the aisle have. Kamala embodied a continuance of that, as well as shitty social policies that are broadly unpopular with the electorate.

"Just FYI buddy: trans people in sports is not a real problem facing society. It is right-wing propaganda, that’s it. It is bullshit. You’ve been tricked.   The NCAA president said there are fewer than 10 trans athletes who play college sports. 10. TEN, dude! Please register that.  Still not getting it? Ok. In 2021, Washington state changed its athletic association rules and allowed trans kids to play on sport teams aligning with their gender identities. Then, in 2023, there was a controversy in Washington over a trans girl playing on a girls’ cross country high school team. So in two years, there was ONE trans kid athlete that caused a controversy in the entire state. One. ONE, dude. Please get this through that brain, I know you can do it.  This is a FAKE issue. Trans athletes are exceedingly rare. It is a pretext for bullying and discrimination and marginalizing an incredibly marginalized community.  And also, these anti-trans athlete bans are incredibly broad and poorly-written. If a trans girl wants to play on an intramural volleyball team, who cares? Surely that’s different than the NFL? But these bans don’t differentiate between 8th grade baseball, 11th grade varsity football, and fucking intramural golf. They ban trans kids and adults from ALL sports. That’s … insane, right? Like objectively, it’s stupid? Can you recognize that dude? Please see that golf is not the same thing as football?  I implore you to stop breathing life into this non-issue.

You'll have to ask Democratic Party strategists that, but I don't think they'd let you or me in the cocktail parties they attend to decide the future of the America that looks nothing like the party they're currently attending, but which they have no desire to actually visit or interact with. They like hanging out with the ""good"" billionaires and doing the non-profit schtick and pretending they're the real-life equivalents of the good guys from The West Wing. That is the extent of their political awareness which, in some ways, is somehow more empty and vapid than that of the right.  Right-wingers have a much better understanding of politics than the ""moderate"" liberals and Democrats in the Democratic Party, even if they have no idea why. To be clear, I *guaran-fucking-tee you* that those Democrats and liberals are way better educated, but our education systems make it a point to pooh-pooh on... *other* political theories, shall we say, so they aren't exposed to them.  But suffice it to say, Marx made some damn good points that are shockingly relevant - both in explaining the class struggle and the way capitalism would lash out on its last legs. Democrats don't understand that. Republicans don't, either, but they act as if they do, because they're fear-driven and cling to their bigotry, and that shit works - and the only alternative to that is an honest, unabashedly pro-labor political party that threatens to burn this shit to the ground unless our demands (which are *eminently* reasonable) are met.  I don't know if the Democratic Party can be that party.
