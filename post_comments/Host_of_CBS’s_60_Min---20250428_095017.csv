This brightened my day. Good to see true journalists standing up to the corporate overlords.,AllynCrane,2025-04-28T10:46:08,14
"The ""adversarial press"" is our first-line of accountability in a democracy.   We elect them. They take office and do what we hired them to do. Who watches them? The press. But more than that they ask, ""Why?"" And that has proven to never be an easy question.  It also reminds me of the story that adored and revered Roman generals would have a rider with them in the chariot before the roaring worshipful masses, whispering in his ear, ""You're just a man. You're no better than anyone else. You're not perfect and never think you are. Remember you are mortal.""  We like our politicians with a little bit of humility. If they don't have it, the press can help them find it.",YallerDawg,2025-04-28T11:01:46,11
