So whereâ€™s the plan? Tweets made from the bathroom while taking a dump mean nothing to me.   Show me the tax plan with the propose brackets and rates and CBO estimates. Anything else is nonsense.,smp501,2025-04-28T05:01:27,746
"Math doesnâ€™t work. Besides income tax being way larger than any plausible tariff amount, market values crash under this and realized gains and rsu income go way down. The richest who pay most of it wonâ€™t be making much in this environment.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-27T20:05:54,750
Gonna target low income people/families more than the middle and upper class. Not sure how a tariff only system would work. Maybe you get a percentage back when you file your taxes if you're below a certain income?,specter491,2025-04-27T20:08:39,419

"Listen up ðŸ¤¡s. The INCOME tax is separate from the payroll taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicaid. Quit your fear mongering shit and talk straight. If tarrifs can bring in enough revenue, and government spending can be reduced, income taxes can be lowered for millions of Americans to offset any price increases caused by tarrifs. This can help shift a good chunk of production back to the U.S so we aren't dependent on Communist China for imports. And because we are working on trade deals with other countries, tarrifs can be eliminated or reduced for imports from countries that don't intend on undermining or destroying the U.S. like Communist China. So Communist Democrats and fake conservatives, get lost, losers. ðŸ˜€Â ",GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-04-28T11:46:54,-9

"Tariffs are how we paid for the Federal Government before income tax. It has happened successfully for 125 years, before the bloated over the top leviathan of the federal government.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T19:50:35,-413
Ohh and I will say this again. The reason the Federal became so big and bloated is that Senators were given over to the Popular Vote of the people rather than appointed by the State Government to protect States Rights.  The Civil War may have been a nail in the coffin of State's Rights but the 17th Amendment was the burying of them.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T19:52:02,-23

">Not like the United States existed from its founding to the 1910â€™s without income tax, RIGHT??  You mean before the US became a military and economic superpower and added social security and Medicare?  >Ignorant alarmism for literally no reason  The last time the President tried tariffs, he had to do a multi billion dollar bailout or the pork industry to save it. Tariffs turned a depression into the Great Depression. It's reasonable to be skeptical of a complete and total abandonment of conservative economics for policies that have failed in the past.  >We solve any budget gaps by lowering spending & creating production based taxation,  Spending has increased under Trump so far, and the only way to make meaningful cuts is to gut the military and social security.  In the best case, production isn't going to go up here for years. In reality, it just won't. The President already admitted he'll slash tariffs against China, and with the chaos in his roll out, companies would have to be run by morons to move production back until after he actually does something permanent. They're all almost better off just waiting him out.  >Edit: downvoters are not conservative  Reddit votes don't determine whether someone is conservative or not. Large scale blanket tariffs are in direct oppositon to conservative economics, and have been for a century.",cathbadh,2025-04-28T06:56:05,281
"They are conservative.   Yes we didnâ€™t have an income tax before 1913, we did however have taxes including tariffs / customs duties, taxes on liquor and tobacco and even taxes on property  sale. So it wasnâ€™t a tax straight out of your paycheck, but you were still paying taxes. Donâ€™t see what the argument is here.  Also you donâ€™t solve budget gaps by waving a magic wand around, said production has to already exist here before you use it for any budget gaps.   You want production taxationâ€¦so taxing the creation of goods before they hit the marketâ€¦.and also boost production to offset budget gaps? You cant have both at the same time. They are completely opposite.  Itâ€™s not an ignorant alarmism stating that the tariffs imposed under Trump is an indirect tax hike to everybody in the US. No matter how many times Trump says China or any other country pays them, the reality is they donâ€™t, we do. They feel the pain of exporting less goods because of the tariffs, but again we pay them.  I do however hope that they eventually lead to new trade deals as thatâ€™s the assumed main objective for now.  Iâ€™m all for getting rid of income tax, but we have to have a **steady** alternative first before doing so considering that **half** of our economy depends on it. Iâ€™m not an economist but that sounds like a considerable chunk of the US economy to not mess around with sudden and not well thought moves.",ElHermito,2025-04-28T05:48:16,174
"Fair point but that was before we added Medicaid, social security, federal unemployment insurance, snap, Medicare, section 8 housing vouchers, earned income tax credit. If we cancelled all of our social subsidies we almost could do it, though weâ€™d still probably need a national property tax or sales tax.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-28T09:07:16,4

"I know. But as you pointed out, our current federal is massively, grotesquely immense. Plus, we have an entire political party staunchly opposed to anything and everything Trump wants to do simply because he's the one that wants it, there's a large percentage of the population that chooses to believe that party's propaganda.   Additionally, I don't know that today's business and geopolitical environment is going to as conducive to tariff-only funding. I hope so though.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-27T19:56:04,-85

Would have to be one hell of a sales pitch in one really bad period of time!,pcm2a,2025-04-27T22:05:39,-14
Trump has talked about no income taxes if you make under 200K. That would benefit me for sure. I think thatâ€™s a bad idea though.  There was talk about a national sales tax during the Obama years. There were a few differing ideas on how to implement this. I could support this if income taxes were eliminated. Everyone should have to pay taxes. At the moment there are far too many passengers.  If everyone has to pay then it keeps the government a little more honest. If your on the lower income scale and congress wants to raise taxes and your directly affected then thatâ€™s potentially a lost vote.  There would have to be a provision that there was not any deductions based on income scales as a way to bribe the electorate.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-28T06:58:07,10
Cheap meaning that slave labor is cheaper than paying someone what they are worth.   Cheap means that other countries devastate their land so we don't have to.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T09:56:49,-5
"But it can be used to reduce our income taxes.  The bottom line, which as you said, Trump is one of very few who want to reduce the Federal Government. Less Government means MORE FREEDOM.  The half that doesn't want it to change barely pays taxes due to many factors  and is incapable of thinking for themselves.  Unfortunately nothing will get done with the 17th Amendment in place. The states can't stop unfunded mandates and other money sapping actions by the Federal government that increase cost on the states themselves with the promise of filtering back a tiny percentage of what they pay to the Federal.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T20:02:43,-132

"It would benefit me as well, along with the 97% of the US taxpayer, however you have to look at the numbers.  The 97% percent of the population who make less than 200k and pay income tax still account for half of all taxes paid which is 1/4 of the US budget.  You canâ€™t change how the government is funded yearly so drastically overnight without a well thought alternative, again we are talking about trillions.  Talk is talk, and every president likes to make promises that sound good but never see fruition because of how unrealistic they would be if implemented.   If they present an alternative plan, with brackets and a CBO study that says it would bridge the budget gap after getting rid of the income tax without sending the economy in the dumpster, Iâ€™m all up for it.  But until then, talking about today, all we got so far is a tax hike due to the tariffs, thereâ€™s no other way to put it.  Hopefully he achieves whatever his initial plan was sooner than later, because the tariffs are not seen as favorable by the electorate (again itâ€™s a tax increase on everyone) and coming midterms if I had to guess, itâ€™s gonna hurt bad if no positive results come from them.",ElHermito,2025-04-28T07:27:09,21
"Cheap meaning cheaper to transport goods around the world 5 times before it makes it to American shores because we have priced ourselves out of the competition with our stifling regulations, and the fact that unions strangled American manufacturing.",mexils,2025-04-28T10:25:55,8
"I canâ€™t say I have really been affected by the tariffs. I try and avoid buying Chinese products anyway on a need va want scale. If I need something and will be used I will buy it.Â  If I just want it most of the time I wonâ€™t purchase it.  My work job is another story. A lot of the parts went from expensive anyway to bend over and take it dry expensive. Fortunately some of the companies we buy from started getting out of China and are now in Vietnam, S Korea, even Mexico.  With the tax code. Itâ€™s broken beyond fixing and needs to be completely changed. I donâ€™t see Congress having the balls to actually fix it. That would require forward thinking and courage.

"Cheap as in they use slave labor, child labor.  Is  it okay that we get cheap stuff while that happens.  Yeah regulations that are more than just safety and health are always onerous and many are just redundant.  Trump in his first term ordered the agencies that he has control of to remove 2 regulations to 1 they want to add. It helped a little. I haven't heard if Biden cancelled it or if so if Trump had added it back.  Yes the only unions I support are the Trade Unions like Plumbers and Electricians. They make sure that people who become both train and learn their craft.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T10:52:29,-4

Clothes, eyeglass frames, laptops / tablets, wood furniture, imported wine, TVs, utensils, pots and pans, cellphones, tires, children toys, power drills, hand tools and the list goes on and on are all effected by tariffs.  These are everyday items.   You just donâ€™t see the tax when you buy the items like the income tax on your paycheck. It still is money out of your pocket going to the government, which is what a tax is.  And yeah agreed with your last sentence.",ElHermito,2025-04-28T07:49:47,25
