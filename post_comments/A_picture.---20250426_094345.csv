"I don't see a way for Ukraine to win that doesn't involve massive US military aid to Ukraine. And I don't see Trump going down that road. To win, they need a fast and effective way to clear minefields. Traditional mine clearing equipment is not effective because fpv drones will take them out within minutes. Same with armored assaults with IFVs or tanks. So that leaves air warfare. You need to take down Russian air defense, which is sometimes deep in true Russian territory. You need long range missiles for that and targeting data. All of this requires deep involvement of the US and allied countries, to the point that we are essentially at war with Russia. Russia can not win the war but I don't see how Ukraine can win without starting WW3.",specter491,2025-04-26T10:26:31,218

"Reconquering their territory? Yes, without a lot more US and EU aid it's extremly unlikely to say the least (unless Russias economy does even worse then expected)   But negotiating a deal such as the EU peace deal? (which is mostly similar to Trumps but with some key differences) That's absolutely achievable and should be an objective both for Ukraine, EU and US. This war is  only the first of many geopolitcal stress tests for the western order and failing now is not an option.   That said even that will need 3 things.    A better and more expanded sanctions, pushing down the oil     B US aid, better if done by also seizing Russian 5B assets in the US and pushing Europe to do the same. US aid won't need to increase but some aid will always be necessary.    C reform the US/EU/Ukraine-Russia diplomacy and messaging which is in a quite sad state as of now.       This includes pubblicly stating that unless Putin accepts this negotiating position the war will be long and costly for Russia with no hope of sanction relief or peace (Russian recruitment increased when talks of a near ceasefire started), when negotiating with Russia doing it together with EU and Ukraine to increase leverage instead of alone. And putting someone competent and a seasoned negotiator to negotiate with Russia instead of Wittkoff. Russians in IR are notorious for using negotiations to try to get everything and give nothing, using Wittkoff is like sacrificing a lamb.   [https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-european-peace-deal-counterproposals-us-talks-london-2025-04-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-european-peace-deal-counterproposals-us-talks-london-2025-04-25/)    The illusion that Ukraine is a far off war that will have no impact on US including a potential Taiwan war is a very dangerous illusion.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-05-01T12:11:22,1

"If Zelensky would face uncomfortable facts, the current plan would work. Freeze the lines of control, and bring in US mining to benefit from the mineral rights.

"War is not a videogame. If population numbers were the only thing that mattered half of histories war would have gone different. Somehow it is often forgotten that Ukraine has been outnumbered and until right now outgunned and outequipped by Russia for the entire war. If that was the only thing that counted Ukraine wouldn't exist right now instead of Russia gaining 1% of Ukraine in the last 2 years and having worse losses. Just to quickly note a couple examples of smaller countries winning wars: US indipendence war, Vietnam war, Winter war (Finland vs Russia), all wars Israel fought, Korean war ecc ecc   One of the reason most analysts are more optimist then a year ago is that for the first time Ukraine is close to a rough parity in shells and generally firepower while Russian equipment becomes more scarce.      So no the idea that US aid couldn't change things is seriously incorrect, that said the amount and quality of EU and US aid needed to allow Ukraine to make serious offensives is not an will not be present anytime soon. What we can achieve is rendering Russians pushes and war unsustainable to negotiate an agreement such as the one proposed by the EU (based on Trumps plan with key differences)",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-05-01T12:21:58,1
