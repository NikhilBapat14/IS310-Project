"To be fair (note well, I think suspending habeus corpus and Trump's other illegal actions to be absurd), the US constitution itself was hubris. Most developed democracies deliberately left room for their societies to grow and adjust laws accordingly by specifically avoiding granting ""inalienable"" rights based on an 18th century point of view. The worst thing is, the founders KNEW they had problems, when they were forced to contradict themselves by claiming that ""all men are created equal"" whilst simultaneously only counting some men as 3/5 of a person!  Please don't get me wrong and assume that I am opposed to the rights in the constitution or the amendments.

"Ok here's an idea. I'm not a lawyer so it could be naive but hear me out.  Put Trump in jail, awaiting trial for the El Salvador death camp ""deportations"". Conviction isn't necessary for that. Moreover, since kidnapping is a violent offense, he can't be released on bail. He doesn't get his trial going until every one of his victims gets the legal due process they were robbed of. If every single person he kidnapped ends up getting deported as a result of that process, Trump can go free and keep making America great again or something. But if even one of these people were innocent, Trump gets put on trial for kidnapping, a separate count for each of his victims.  All of this would still be insanely lenient to Trump, highlighting his absurd privilege. He won't really be punished for violating the people's right to due process, or for involving El Salvador instead of deporting to the country of origin. And he only gets basic kidnapping charges, nothing about abuse of power or effectively leading an organized-crime human trafficking operation.

Other countries have high thresholds for amendments to their constitutions as well. What they don't have, is specificity on laws that are clearly likely to need adapting as society changes.

It looks like many other countries are able to fend off their far right maniacs - our voters have not managed to do that. It might be the case that other countries have more will to grant more rights to people than we do rather than the problem being in the way the Constitution is written.",StormOk7544,2025-05-09T16:34:35,8

"Why is that fucked up?  It takes time to have a trial.  Public safety doesn't matter?  Someone shoots up a school and kills 20 people, you want them sent home to wait for trial?",DannyDOH,2025-05-10T11:49:48,1
"Other countries have political systems better suited to ensuring the will of the people is heard.  eg. I'm Australian - we have compulsory voting which ensures politicians need to stay relatively centrist to get elected. So when we have a change of power, it swings from center-left to centre-right or vica-versa. Our seats are also drawn up by an independent Electoral Commission, so no gerrymandering!  I live in Brazil. It also has compulsory voting & ere they have runoff elections rather than first past the post. It also helps to ensure that whoever is elected has a clear majority rather than a plurality.  I would suggest that the problem in US politics lays far more in the electoral systems that have been allowed to proliferate rather than the voters. From gerrymandering to the electoral college, primaries through to first past the post, the entire system seems to be designed to do anything other than ensure the will of the people is heard!",FairDinkumMate,2025-05-09T16:53:47,2
"Yes, because if we know anything, it's that the vast majority of people in prison are there for shooting 20 people, right? It couldn't possibly be that the vast majority of our prison system is made up by non-violent offenders.  Don't act like every trial that keeps people locked up is for some horrifically violent thing like that. There are people spending years in jail waiting for basic battery charges, basic drug possession charges, or stupid little things like shoplifting. And when you have not been convicted of a crime, the US should not be allowed to incarcerate you for as long as it likes.  Make up all the little excuses you want that have absolutely no bearing on reality, it's wrong.  And in the situation with a guy shooting up 20 people, what if they grabbed the wrong person in the chaos? What if they grabbed more than one person that they were suspicious of and lock both of them up for the entirety of the trial? What if they happen to grab someone that was pulling their gun out to try to stop the mass shooter under the assumption that they were the killer? Do they deserve to sit in still waiting for the trial to finish because they tried to help? Does a bystander deserve to spend a year in jail just because the police aren't sure who the perpetrator was?",StevesRune,2025-05-10T13:21:32,1
Gerrymandering is pretty bad. That I would agree with is a pretty big issue.,StormOk7544,2025-05-09T17:27:56,5
