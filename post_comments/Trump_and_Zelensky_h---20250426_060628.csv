Why do I feel like Trump wanted this for a photo opp.,thistimelineisweird,2025-04-26T06:08:34,21
Trump doesn't even know how to dress for a funeral. What a clown.,sniffstink1,2025-04-26T06:16:10,14
Could have been an iconic image if Trump had not been working for the adversaries of whom he is sitting infront of.,Chiababa,2025-04-26T06:14:52,5

"Unless these talks lead directly to peace, they are an intentional and symbolic mockery of Pope Francis.  Trump is anti-Christ to the very core.",Stunning-Morning2665,2025-04-26T09:07:07,2

"This is so trivial of me, apologies, but looking at the photo with Macron touching Zelensky I thought ""Macron: making sideburns great again.""",Hairy_rambutan,2025-04-26T06:35:11,1
"Mr. President, why do good people like Pope die early?  \-Zelensky",reddittorbrigade,2025-04-26T06:53:22,1
"My initial reaction seeing that picture of Trump, Macron, Zelensky and Starmer together is relief.  But I wonder what Putin thinks.   He could be thinking ""haha, my favorite agent will tell me exactly what they are talking about"".",Bubbly-Two-3449,2025-04-26T07:06:48,1
I wonder what vile things trump is using the occasion to say to him.,Choice_Cup_3624,2025-04-26T08:00:47,1
"I met with Zalenskia and told him that Putin wants Boardwalk, Park Place, the greens, yellows, reds, oranges, purples, light blues and all 4 railroads. I told Zalenskia I managed to get him the utilities and Free Parking because I'm the BEST Deal maker in the Universe. I'm thinking Zalenskia will take the deal and I'll go down in history as the BEST DEAL maker of ALL TIME!",TopEagle4012,2025-04-26T06:41:33,0
Why isn’t Zelensky wearing a suit ! ? I mean it’s the popes funeral  come on lololol he can’t even dress up For this occasion in a suit ? He is instead wearing  an expensive black suede  shirt like you would wear to a bar !! Can someone short please donate a  proper suit to this guy or maybe we need to let him pull out 80 bucks of the billions 🇺🇸 America the great  has loaned him !? ,CupExcellent9520,2025-04-26T11:28:09,-2
"That photo gives a real good look of his bald spot, so he's probably not happy with it",Shartcastic,2025-04-26T06:29:41,10
Wearing black would indicate that the day is about someone else.  This is well beyond the reach of a malignant narcissist.  It must be about him at all times.  The ill fitting blue suit that he adorns day after day without mercy represents his maniacal obsession with himself as a brand.  What a complete disgrace.,Lostsailor73,2025-04-26T06:26:41,17
"Thing is he we know he owns a black suit.  He wore it last time to the Vatican, but I bet he got much fatter and it didn't fit.  The guy is too self-centered to consider buying another.",TintedApostle,2025-04-26T06:34:10,4

The crypt under the basilica has many places to hide things.,TintedApostle,2025-04-26T06:34:49,1
As long as Russia occupies any part of Ukraine there will be no peace.,TintedApostle,2025-04-26T06:33:20,12
And of course with him donating his salary to charity he probably can't swing purchasing a new suit. Especially in this economy.,biscuitarse,2025-04-26T07:27:43,1
"I’m still holding out hope for peace, most especially for Ukraine 🇺🇦",edemberly41,2025-04-26T06:38:12,5
I am holding out for justice for Ukraine.  Peace for the sake of peace is a prelude to disaster.  Rewarding Putin for aggression just shows weakness.  He will regroup and try again.,TintedApostle,2025-04-26T06:39:07,8
Agreed.,edemberly41,2025-04-26T06:41:56,2
One of those rare threads you can upvote both sides of the conversation. Well done.,biscuitarse,2025-04-26T07:31:58,2
Thank you.,edemberly41,2025-04-26T10:49:23,1
"It’s just someone being reasonable and another person being aggressively pedantic. Giving “ALL lives matter” Karen vibes, tbh",real-username-tbd,2025-04-26T07:56:59,0
It surely the fuck beats the alternative of escalation and locking oneself into uncompromising positions. Just my opinion.,biscuitarse,2025-04-26T08:34:03,1
I didn’t see that here. I just saw what i wrote about. But to each their own. Can’t please everyone and everybody has a hater.,real-username-tbd,2025-04-26T17:31:39,1
