"A very stupid take. It’s been traditional Arab attire for many centuries and saying it’s now synonymous with the 7 October attack is incredibly offensive and moronically ethnocentric and hypocritical.   But fair to note that the ‘Jewish groups’ in question seem to be one rabbi and the ‘Chicago Jewish Alliance’, which was founded last year and has… an Instagram account with pictures of a group of maybe two dozen people? And not much else? Not sure we can say these represent the Jewish community in any significant way. So might be a mountain out of a molehill, headlines inflating the social media spewing of some random morons.",AndreasDasos,2025-04-27T12:42:16,21
From the same organizations that claim a person seeing a Palestine flag is an act of antisemitic persecution.,Good-Gold-6515,2025-04-27T12:41:23,17
"*But would it not be possible [to] commemorate Arab Heritage without wearing the symbol that millions of Jews around the world saw worn to celebrate the murder, rape and kidnapping of October 7th?”*  Using this logic is it safe to say the Yarmulke is equally as offensive if ever written by someone committing such crimes?  No?  Then it's a stupid, stupid point.",drfsrich,2025-04-27T12:24:30,15
"Jewish woman living in Chicago here. The keffiyeh is not a symbol of terrorism. The outrage over the mayor celebrating Arab heritage by wearing one exposes the right-wing, pro-Israel effort to police speech and silence solidarity with Palestinians.   Criticizing Israel’s actions or standing with the Palestinian people is not just a right — it’s a moral imperative. We are watching Palestinian families, children, and entire communities being starved, bombed, and slaughtered by the Israeli government. Speaking out against this brutality and standing up for their humanity is not hate — it’s basic decency.",Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-04-27T15:52:28,4
