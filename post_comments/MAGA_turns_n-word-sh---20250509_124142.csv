">A Minnesota woman who called a five-year-old Black child the ‚Äún-word,‚Äù and then repeated that racial slur multiple times in a viral video while defending her actions, has raised over $700,000 as she has become a cultural folk-hero to much of the American far-right.   ...   In the video, which was filmed by 30-year-old Sharmake Omar in a Minnesota public park, Hendrix admits that she called a young Somali boy the ‚Äún-word‚Äù because ‚Äúhe took my son‚Äôs stuff.‚Äù She then goes on to repeat the slur multiple times before seemingly justifying her actions during the filmed confrontation with Omar.  >‚ÄúIf that's what he's going to act like,‚Äù Hendrix says when asked by Omar why she used the ‚Äún-word‚Äù to describe the child. Omar told NBC News that the child is on the autism spectrum and that the parents, whom he knows, have expressed support in filing charges against Hendrix, and a local chapter of the NAACP has raised more than $300,000 for the family since the video went viral. Local police, meanwhile, have said they completed an investigation of the incident.",brain_overclocked,2025-05-09T12:48:29,37

Then, they'll end up pronouncing it in a strained and pointedly intense fashion (maybe rhyming it with ""knee guard"").   Democrats will be appalled. Schumer might even do nothing, thinking Republicans using open racial slurs in the halls of Congress will play well for the Dems in the next midterms.
