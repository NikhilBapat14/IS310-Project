"“Multiple illegal aliens arrested had violent criminal convictions”  Then they go on to claim that 4 of the 800 had convictions, you will get a higher conviction rate at a Republican Party fundraiser",JelloBelter,2025-04-26T22:20:01,84
"I don't think half of what ICE says about these 'illegal aliens"" is true. ICE is just the Gestapo at this point looking to make their numbers and please their overlords.  Meanwhile, businesses will close, and fields won't be harvested. I'm waiting for the raid on Disneyland hotel maids. It's all disgusting.",Psychicgoat2,2025-04-26T22:20:37,35

"What's weird is Obama and Biden were already deporting criminals. Obama even took heat for deporting more people than ever before. They certainly deported more than Trump did in his first term.   Biden came up with a bipartisan bill to deal with the problem - part of it was to hire more judges so they could speed the process up. But trump made sure the bill didn't pass, because he was running on illegal immigration issues. He needed that as a cudgel.   And of course, forget hiring judges, DOGE is all about decimating the government. But Trump's way is to just do away with due process.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T04:15:39,5

"Given the track record for credibility of the Trump Administration, coupled with its numerous examples of incompetence and outright stupid conduct, I'll be hard pressed to believe most of these propaganda press releases as anything other than attempts to sell the public more BS.",gunnergoz,2025-04-26T22:30:51,6

So according to them with millions and millions and millions of people coming across the border it'll only take..... Checks notes.  1200 arrests like this per million.    That'll totally be cheaper and more productive than inviting them to share in the economy. ,SchwillyThePimp,2025-04-26T23:52:35,1

Yup willing to bet if i stopped the next 800 people that came down my street you would have more then 4 people with past violent convictions.,sedatedlife,2025-04-26T22:28:13,24

Thats more than my hometown and they would find several violent criminals. Probably mostly coaches that prey on young girls who also worried about keeping those girls safe from transwomen athletes.,Tsisquoquo,2025-04-27T01:02:32,7

"Cops are weird.  My old neighbor, she was about six years into blue force.  One memorial day weekend we did a barbeque with the poor brown neighbors and she was nice as could be.    She also broke her leg judo-ing some poor lady to the pavement and they didn't even arrest the lady.   When I pressed her, she'd do it again with force, even with the broken leg.  She's just out to beat people up.   She knows she's in a class, in a boys club, in a gang.  Her taking an ICE job would not surprise me one bit.    Piece of shit doesn't describe the bipolar like life of a cop.  Seems like it's hard to get close to people who aren't cops or criminals, IMO, so they just go full on cop.  Like a drug, or a switch they can't flip off, they end up at ICE.",bm1949,2025-04-26T23:06:41,1
"Agriculture, social security, taxes ...  They recently watered down child labor laws to make up for the rotting fruit.   Vice did a great documentary on a Southern State ( Alabama maybe?)  that harassed foreign workers to the point they left and worked somewhere else. And then there was no one to pick the food. They tried prison labor, but not much motivation there, they didn't do a great job bent over in the heat of the fields all day.   They quietly invited the migrant labor back.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T04:05:11,3
