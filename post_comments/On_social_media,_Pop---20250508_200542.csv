Pointing out objectively shitty things shouldn't be political.,JadedIT_Tech,2025-05-08T20:10:33,16
"Considering the makeup of official Roman Catholic Church doctrine, he wouldn’t be much of a bishop or cardinal if he didn’t.",aloofman75,2025-05-08T23:29:12,2
The pope shouldn’t be a political thing and politics shouldn’t be religious. Fuck you 2024 voters.,fowlraul,2025-05-08T20:09:41,6
Let’s see if Trump wants to continue with his executive order to hunt down anyone that attacks Christians….,cdistefa,2025-05-08T21:12:15,1

"Pope Leo's rise may be due in large part to a reaction to Trump's awful views! Trump's views already have been effective in recently electing anti-Trump leaders in Canada and Australia.   This strongly suggests to me that if there were no voter-suppression in the US Trump would have been soundly thumped in the US as well. The only way Republicans can win is by cheating and reducing voter turnout. If people vote then Republicans lose. And if Democrats win, then Americans can get the things they want, such as health care, Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, increase in minimum wage, the protection of women's rights, environmental protection, etc.",Kalepa,2025-05-10T10:02:05,1
"He's also a conservative bigot, so he has a lot more in common with republicans than he does democrats. ",Bakedads,2025-05-08T20:45:30,-5
The pope has always been a political thing.,DeliveryGuy1996,2025-05-08T20:13:59,5
Historically the Pope has always been a political figure. That doesn't change whether someone's Catholic or not.,GilgaPol,2025-05-09T02:36:39,2
"He'd have to do it via ouija board, which conservative Christians don't use.",Tiny-Conversation-29,2025-05-08T22:03:56,1

He's the head of Vatican State - of course he's also political.,KeinFussbreit,2025-05-08T21:13:20,9
It's political for people who care about it.   It's like me saying Republicans are political. Sure. They technically are. I don't give a shit about what they say because I can ignore it.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-08T21:33:20,3
"The pope being perhaps the single most political thing in the western world describes...a significant portion of european history. Like, for a good long while the pope wielded power and influence greater than most kings. Not AS true now, sure, and politics shouldn't be religious, but the point stands.",BlueDragon101,2025-05-08T22:53:50,3
"Religion is a fairy tale, and not the good one…like you want.",fowlraul,2025-05-08T21:17:42,-6
"Some things are political regardless of if you feel they directly affect you. If you were a park ranger who lost your job due to budget cuts, or if you were wrongfully deported without due process, despite being a legal resident of the US, you wouldn’t be able to ignore politics.",DeliveryGuy1996,2025-05-09T05:22:44,1
"Yeah if you go back in history, the pope had a lot of power and influence after the fall of the western Roman Empire.",DeliveryGuy1996,2025-05-09T05:59:11,1
"I was forced into being a Catholic (like it happens with most religions), but left the church as soon it was possible.  But the Pope is still a political figure.",KeinFussbreit,2025-05-08T21:20:46,4
