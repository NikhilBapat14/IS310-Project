"**Fox News Forced to Admit That Everyone Hates Trump**  LOL! I would not say hate is the first reaction. Disgust maybe, revulsion perhaps.  Anyone who understands how his mind works is repulsed by him.  There is no secret to it, no mystical insight. He has many of the psychological defects ordinary people grow out of over time, so we have all seen it elsewhere, but he's got it bad and never grew up.  He is arrogant and prideful, he lacks many basic virtues, he lacks empathy, he lacks gratitude. He spent his entire life satisfying his most basic human desires. He is a hedonist, self indulgent, more than willing to violate others for his own benefit or pleasure. No regard for the law, no respect for our constitution.

"Just because people didn’t vote, doesn’t mean they didn’t hate him. Only reason I didn’t vote is cuz I thought the choice was so obvious, there’s no way people would actually vote for trump considering everything he had said and done by then. Policies aside, dude got felonies galore, and has said some incredibly stupid and nonsensical things (more so than usual), so I figured he would’ve lost a fair amount of respect from even his supporters, and we’d win by a landslide. Unfortunately, I was horribly wrong, as I’m assuming most of the people who hate him, yet didn’t vote, felt the same way I did and didn’t see the need to vote cuz of how obvious the choice was. Sometimes it’s hard to remember how stupid some Americans really are, but I’ll make sure not to forget again. It’s too late now, but this has definitely taught me a lesson and convinced me I need to vote every time from now on, and I’m sure others feel much the same. And while I’m sure he still has plenty of supporters for some reason, he *is* losing at least *some* of his support. People are coming to their senses, slowly but surely. Like you said, it’s not everyone, but I think it’d be safe to say we’re at the very least *close* to most, if not already there.",Nugby_Higginbottoms,2025-04-24T21:54:17,6

"What you are describing is the natural outcome of unrestricted capitalism seeping into the pores of society. This is what happens when both political parties become driven by moneyed interests and completely abandon the working class. They cut social welfare programs we all use daily while telling us that the lack of money toward social services isn’t actually something they did, but something that those dirty no good marginalized-group-of-the-weeks have done to them.  The only reason we even have the resources in the first place to even consider building a utopia is due to the exploitation of nations that the United States has engaged in during centuries of imperialism. If the gains were made off the backs of the poor and exploited worldwide to begin with, then the people in charge who could use it toward the working class are never going to do that and just funnel it all into their own pockets.",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-24T18:41:20,53

"I'm not sure religion fully explains it. I think citing religion just moves the goalpost and creates a new problem: nearly every wealthy country exhibits low religiosity (compared to high religiosity in poor countries). Why then is America so religious?   I believe Barry Glasser answered this in his book, The Culture Of Fear. Citizens in poor countries have much to be afraid of and their economic and societal stability is often threatened or non-existent. So those citizens feel powerless to control their lives, and thus turn to an all-powerful deity or deities to provide protection. Americans should NOT feel this instability and uncertainty but are made to do so through compromised media (""invasion of the brown people!"", ""murderers at your doorstep!"", etc), lack of gun control (constant shootings), demonization of minority groups (those queers are coming to get you), dissolution of rights ( big gov wants your guns), and other issues. Most Americans, for example, have very little in savings and are one crisis away from absolute ruin. So they remain as religious as someone in a much poorer country, even though the wealth is there to improve the lives of every citizen in the country.   The result is Americans are afraid. They are afraid economically and socially. So religiosity remains high, but it's a sort of psuedo-manufactured religiosity, which is why there's so many holes, contradictions, and cherry picking with the ""faith"". It's the kind of religiosity you would have if people in power were pulling strings to ensure there are haves and have nots.   Just my 2 cents.",MyToesHugEachOther,2025-04-24T21:35:42,113

And without the order, no amount of money will get the goods because the manufacturer in china needs 2 months to make them and 1 months to ship them.  I thought I was clued up on tariffs but it was a real eye opener on how a company has to raise prices on pre-imported stock, to allow them to accept delivery on stock subject to tariffs, and that they loose out on profit for a while because their existing liquidity is locked up in paying tarffs and hoping someone else will pay the higher price to bail them out.
