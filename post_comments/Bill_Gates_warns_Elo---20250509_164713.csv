Slashing global health budgets to save money is how you end up paying with lives instead.,fulltrendypro,2025-05-09T16:51:31,26

"[Bill Gates is calling out fellow tech billionaire Elon Musk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/tech/bill-gates-elon-musk-usaid-cuts-criticism?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) over cuts made to US government spending under his watch through the Department of Government Efficiency, saying the gutting of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) would lead to millions of deaths around the world.  The warning comes after the Trump administration took steps to dismantle USAID and halt its foreign assistance mission, with Musk bragging about feeding the agency to the “woodchipper.” In the weeks since, many non-profits have grappled with canceled contracts or sporadic payments, although some have since been restored amid warnings from aid organizations about the potentially deadly consequences of cutting the funding.  “When Elon went into government, if his thing really was about efficiency or using AI, you know, of course we need to make the government more efficient. If that’s what it had been, then it’s a praiseworthy thing to put his time and expertise (into),” Gates said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Friday. “The fact that it turned into slashing these people, I didn’t expect that and some of that should be put back in place.”  Gates added that the world is in a “global health emergency” because of spending cuts to health programs by the US and European governments.  The Microsoft cofounder’s comments come [after he announced on Thursday](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/tech/bill-gates-giving-money-away-20-years?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) plans to give away $200 billion — including “virtually all” of his personal wealth — through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years before closing the organization, an acceleration of his previous spending plans. The decision was motivated in part, he said, by concerns that progress on improving global health is stagnating or even reversing.  *The full interview will air on Fareed Zakaria GPS on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET and 1 p.m. ET.*",cnn,2025-05-09T16:48:49,9

Pretty much the point. There's a strong argument that anyone supporting Musk's actions is immoral and unethical. That's how I've treated those that align their views with him.,HedgehogOk7722,2025-05-09T17:22:47,1

It is absurd.  Claim to be able to achieve 2 trillion in savings from increasing efficiency and reducing fraud.   Walk away with 150 billion in budget cuts. Still gets applauds from the Trump admin. Epic.,Embarrassed-Box-3380,2025-05-09T19:38:37,10

"We really need to make sure people mention the cost of the damage Musk has done when mentioning even the ""$150 billion"" he claims to have ""saved""... because the costs far outweigh the ""savings"" even if you give him the benefit of the doubt on that claim.  At the end of the day, Musk has likely cost us trillions of dollars and millions of lives, and permanently set back or unrecoverably destroyed countless beneficial government functions, research programs, scientific progress as a whole, etc.",Prior-Tea-3468,2025-05-09T21:17:13,8
