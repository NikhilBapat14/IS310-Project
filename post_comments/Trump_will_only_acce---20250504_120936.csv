"IOW, The Great Dealmaker is not going to get a deal there, either.  100 days and counting — 0 deals.  Allies turned into adversaries or opponents.  Enemies made more resolute.  Wins… ?? (not shown)",AINonsense,2025-05-04T14:22:39,1

"> He backed out of the deal during his first term.  He *ripped up* the ongoing deal.  Then he assassinated their top general, by luring him to ‘peace talks’ and ambushing him *en route.*  Iran might find trusting him a tough sell.",AINonsense,2025-05-04T14:28:23,12

He means Trump is the reason Iran has been free to make progress in arming itself nuclear weapons. That Trump ripped up the Iran Nuclear Agreement in his first term.,JewsieJay,2025-05-04T18:03:07,2
"By this point, who in their right mind would put a nanosecond thought  into negotiating with a man who never keeps his word, never pays his debts, swears he's just done the best deal in history until the next day when he flips and calls it the worst deal in the world, and who shits in his pants?",AINonsense,2025-05-04T17:33:05,4
"Reading r/politics has really been exhausting with center leftists making up their own form of misinformation to fit some narrative. It’s weird and concerning.   Yeah, Trump ripped up Obama’s thing. Then Biden gave back some form of nuclear deal. Then Trump was going to rip it up in this term. Then he said he wouldn’t in exchange for Iran to give the all the enriched uranium to a nuclear armed country(Russia). Also, for them (Iran) to be subjected to plant inspections with watch dogs (IAEA). THEN now says no nuclear power period.   Gotta love this administration.  Israel lobbyist be lobbying with maximum effectiveness. Lol",RelevantNothing2692,2025-05-04T16:56:06,3
