The 25th amendment is in play if the president is incapable of fulfilling his oath.,AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-04T13:01:49,40
Two previous impeachments already told the public that he doesn’t think he has to uphold the Constitution.,AKMarine,2025-05-04T12:56:06,20
But remember how tightly the right used to cling to the constitution like it was the greatest thing ever written?   Funny how fast that changed eh?,PopPalsUnited,2025-05-04T12:58:26,16
"isint it in the oath of office?  ""i swear to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states.""  i feel like the reporter should have thrown that in his face after that response. but i guess that just goes to show the level of journalistic integrety we have in the united states. fucking trash, all of them.  and if your a journalist reading this. yes i mean YOU",IBAZERKERI,2025-05-04T12:55:13,20

"Trump thinks just because he thinks the US needs Greenland for international security it should belong to them/him. If anyone ""needs it for security"" (another not serious Trump idea), it certainly must be Canada. What he actually means is that he wants it for trade routes. He's also very patronizing in how he speaks about taking care of the native Greenlanders. It sounds like the way they took care of those pesky little native Indian villages that were scattered about NA.   Wouldn't Putin love it if NATO had to defend Denmark against a US incursion into Greenland? ahhh.....lmao",TheRealJenneJ,2025-05-04T13:10:44,3

"You are being unfair to the journalist, who asked good and tough questions. I don’t know on what grounds you are questioning her integrity. She is not individually responsible for the whole media, and the media is not solely responsible for the many flaws in our society and politics system.
