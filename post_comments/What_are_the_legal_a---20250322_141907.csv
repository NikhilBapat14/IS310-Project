"At first glance, it seems to be a blatant violation of the 4th, 5th and 6th amendments.  Except that more latitude is permitted for immigration enforcement within 100 miles of the US border.  This includes the east and west coasts plus the Great Lakes, not just the land borders with Canada and Mexico.  As it so happens, the vast majority of the country lives within this enforcement zone.  Those who have been in the country for less than two years and are not asylum seekers can be deported with very little in the way of due process.  I am willing to bet that the administration has been sloppy in determining who was rounded up.  That provides opportunities for attorneys to sue.    However, this Supreme Court is not likely to provide generous interpretations of the laws if these cases go to the top.  The administration is probably counting on that.",I405CA,2025-03-22T20:17:26,47

Nothing really   Theoretically the Supreme Court gets involved and rules the administration’s actions were legal or illegal.   Even if illegal; trump just pardons everyone involved   I guess he could get removed from office if enough of the Senate votes as such in an impeachment action.

"Non-citizens are still entitled to Constitutional protections such as due process. Of course, this means that deporting illegal immigrants becomes a tedious process. So how does the Trump administration get around this? By having a Republican majority Congress that has abdicated its authority to hold the president accountable, meaning it can openly ignore federal court rulings. And should rulings get appealed to SCOTUS, SCOTUS has a 6-3 conservative majority of which most of those members are supportive of a unitary executive. Legally, the Trump administration has practically very little in its way for now. It would require Republicans to lose their majority in both chambers of Congress during the midterms or them collectively growing a spine to defy Trump.  Politically, Trump is also insulated against short term consequences. Deporting illegal immigrants was one of the key policies he was elected on by his base. There are multiple Trump voters on record with family members who have been detained/deported but nevertheless still support Trump’s immigration policy. Even non-Republicans moderates who view immigration as a critical issue are not too likely to shed too many tears over Trump’s immigration policy because illegal immigrants are a low hanging fruit with few political friends outside of the progressive Democratic wing. After all, illegal immigrants are the perfect whipping post since most of the country broadly does not support unchecked immigration with no practical consequences for most illegal immigrants, in addition to believing that illegal immigrants are entitled to less rights than citizens. The places that are heavily protesting Trump’s immigration policy were never going to vote for him anyways.",equiNine,2025-03-22T21:47:49,10

"If the deportees are harmed upon return due to their race or religion, the shit show is going to explode into a monkey zoo exhibit.    It's interesting that only one out of 250 had a pending hearing.  That indicates to me that the administration was trying very hard to make sure none of them had hearings and nearly succeeded.  We may see that one person back in the US.  But the other 249, I can't see what possible legal issue there is.    Did you know that Americans are not guaranteed individual trials either?  In criminal cases a set of people can be tried together.    The federal police can deport aliens without legal residency.  This is a general rule that only does not apply when an exception arises.  I think a pending asylum hearing is an exception.  I don't think the judicial inadequacies of the courts where they end up is an exception.    >Could this approach expand in scope—using foreign penal systems to detain individuals without U.S. oversight?  The United States sent POWs captured in Afghanistan to Syria to be tortured by the Assad secret police.  This happened in the mid 2000's.  I don't think that and the current practices are related.  What the Trump admin just did is not a scaled down version of what Bush's admin did.",rcglinsk,2025-03-24T13:14:51,2

"Honestly, the judge needs to order those in charge to appear in court regarding whether contempt should be ordered.  Then, whoever shows up have the bailiff immediately arrest at least one of them, hold them in contempt, and order the attorney to get the defendants back so their case can be adjudicated properly.  The court can hold people in their own facility under contempt laws to enforce court orders.  Let them appeal to the Supreme Court, but they'll remain in contempt lock up for now.  This isn't the time to be a pussy or ""take the high road.""  Court orders need to be followed, especially when someone's life and liberty are at stake.  We can't play games with this shit.  Order attorneys to be held in contempt.  Disbar attorneys.  Hold the ones in charge in prison under rules of contempt to compel compliance.  The only way this stops is if everyday people get held accountable.  ""Following orders"" can't be a defense.  But I'm not holding my breath.",okay_pumkin,2025-03-31T14:27:53,1
"By the time the judge gave the order, it was too late. The planes had already flown outside of the judge's jurisdiction. In fact, some had gotten far enough that they would not have enough fuel to make it back even if the pilots consented to turn around.   Oh, and all these guys had criminal convictions, either here In the US or in other countries. A good chunk of the deportees will be standing trial in El Salvador for crimes they committed there. While they are ""suspected"" of being gang members, they have very real convictions, or at least arrest warrants.",Far_Realm_Sage,2025-03-23T16:31:04,-6

"I really don't think a district court judge has jurisdiction over a flight that's already in the air.   Plus how far over the water were they? how much fuel did the planes have left?  as it even possible to turn them back by the time the judge made his order?      U.S. Travel Act says its illegal for a citizen to travel outside to commit an act that's illegal in the us.  but you don't get charged with that act.  like if I flew to canada to club baby seals, or flew to japan to hunt whales.  I don't get charged with animal abuse, i get charged with a US travel act voilation.  indicating US laws stop at our borders,  and there for so would a judges jurisdiction      So if the planes were truly outside of US Air space, then I think its reasonable to assume at most the pilot / ice agents could be held liable for the us travel act, but that's about it.        It also raises broader questions about precedent. Could this approach expand in scope—using foreign penal systems to detain individuals without U.S. oversight?

"There's not much ""implications"". This is a consequence.  Since the law wasn't enforced for so long, people got fed up, and now it swings in the other direction.   There are 2 ways this can end. The Trump administration calms down, or it will swing once again in the other direction. At the moment, they can basically do anything with immigration, because he got elected exactly because immigration was handled with kid gloves.

An example; Italy's right-wing government is actually very popular among young Italian voters (another consequence of this Western bad governance is that Western Gen-Z men are more conservative than their Millenial and Gen-X counterparts). They got to power with support from the youth. It's not an old Boomer thing anymore.   The Italian PM deported a Muslim man who was living in Italy for decades because he criticized the country from an Islamic pov. He didn't actually commit any crime to my understanding but simply criticized the country. So she said deported him.

And the Trump administration deliberately hurried to launch planes. Planes were launching an hour after Trump illegally invoked the Alien Enemies Act.

Who the fuck knows what will happen tomorrow.  I am just saying, the law clearly outlines what an official act is and what it is not.  If Trump violates the law he is not immune from criminal prosecution, because it would not be an official act.  He would need authority under the law to act for it to be an official act.  If he violates that authority its not an official act.  I hope I have repeated myself enough that this makes sense.",neverendingchalupas,2025-03-23T14:51:42,0
"You are just referencing one aspect of the opinion.  Again the opinion relies on Section 5, that Congress is the sole body responsible for providing a remedy to the provisions of the 14th Amendment.  But the Supreme Court already invalidated Section 5 when it ruled against the Voting Rights Act which was a remedy mandated by Section 5.  The Supreme Court did not rule that the method used was unconstitutional, just that the data was old.  Which is like saying the First and Second Amendment are unconstitutional because they were written hundreds of years ago.  The U.S. Supreme Court cant write law, it can only interpret it.  But in the case of the Voting Rights Act, they wrote law.  They created a Constitutional crisis.  As a result the word 'Shall' is no longer an imperative command.  The Supreme Court took the power of the pen away from Congress.  And even then from the majority opinion of the Colorado ballot case.  >This can hardly come as a surprise, given that the substantive provisions of the Amendment “embody significant limitations on state authority.” Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976). Under the Amendment, States cannot abridge privileges or immunities, deprive persons of life, liberty, or property without due process, deny equal protection, or deny male inhabitants the right to vote (without thereby suffering reduced representation in the House). See Amdt. 14, §§1, 2. On the other hand, the Fourteenth Amendment grants new power to Congress to enforce the provisions of the Amendment against the States. It would be incongruous to read this particular Amendment as granting the States the power—silently no less—to disqualify a candidate for federal office  So then the right to vote, the right to due process, the Fourteenth Amendment isnt granting new power to Congress, its reinforcing existing provisions of the Fourtheenth Amendment in its entirety.  Which would include who can vote for a candidate that **holds** federal office.  Unless you think the right to vote, the right to due process arent things that exist?   >Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article  The **article** would be the 14th Amendment in its entirety.

Because the 3(c) bail in provisions require that the DoJ show that citizens of a given jurisdiction are having their right to vote abridged based on race, color or prior condition of servitude. The 4(b) coverage formula fixed things at an ever receding point in time that no longer reflected reality in any way, IE the urban areas of blue states that would have been covered under it had they chosen 2000 as the new base year or simply set it as a rolling 4 year look back period.     > Specially since all these states have had issues with racial discrimination following this court case.
