I'm sure the GOP will parrot the same bullshit they have been when their own constituents rightly raise their concerns about what god-emperor cheeto is doing.   they're plants  they're paid by soros  they're not republicans  etc.  anything rather than having the truth stare them in the face.,ProJoe,2025-05-05T16:22:56,300
"***From Rolling Stone’s Naomi LaChance:***  Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) faced angry attendees at his town hall in the Hudson Valley on Sunday. About 600 constituents bombarded him with questions and jeers while more protested outside, and multiple attendees were asked to leave or forcibly removed from the venue. Lawler, one of many Republicans to be met with hostile town hall crowds as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have dismantled the federal government, represents a swing district that will be contested in 2026.

Less than 30 republicans crossing party lines is all it would take to stop this horror show. Instead they are blocking anything that might keep this in check at every point.
