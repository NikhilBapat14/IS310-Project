Taking it down sends the worst possible message. You don’t honor victims by erasing them.,Kitchen_Bicycle4339,2025-05-05T05:12:53,39

"Let's imagine Nazis retake power. One of the first things they do is attack universities that teach compassion, acceptance, and that all people are equal, especially minorities. Then they go after immigrants and deport them and lock them up without due process. Then then they take over the media and start turning lies into truth and truth into lies. Then they open up previously shuttered prisons in the name of having facilities to lock up the worst liberal and opposing viewpoints. Then, they turn the country's best allies into new enemies by destroying previously agreed contracts and trade deals under the guise of protecting the country. And then they threaten and cajole all the elected politicians in the legislature to do their bidding. Of course, this is all fantasy, and this could never happen in the United States of America, right?",TopEagle4012,2025-05-05T05:57:11,11
"Every day another creepy small change that reminds us we are being shuttled like cattle in a chute into an authoritarian world view that our grandchildren will accept as normal.   >In a statement to NPR on Sunday, a DOJ spokesperson suggested it will still honor victims in other ways, but not only of gun violence: ""The ATF will continue to honor the memory of all victims of violent crime while at the same time preserving the rights of law-abiding Americans.""  So they have to remove an exhibit pointing out that guns are  dangerous and have destroyed lives?   According to the ATF:  >Our Vision  >A leader in the Nation’s fight to disrupt violent crime for safer communities.  Why is this really happening? What is the message of the removal?",SicilyMalta,2025-05-05T05:21:02,6

Right - more erasure. Like the words Trans and Queer being wiped from the Stonewall Monument when trans and queer people were the ones responsible for the uprising.   Soon the monument itself will disappear - budget cuts. Money needed for parades and sadly suffering rich people.   Is this the first step to abolishing the ATF?,SicilyMalta,2025-05-05T05:29:30,3
There are no victims to mourn and honor if they’re erased. They’ll likely stop putting the names of dead people in the news and just give kill counts,No_Education_8888,2025-05-05T11:30:16,1
"Firearms was always third on the list . . .   Joking aside, it's a petty erasure of the victims and casualties of a problem they're not really going to do anything about.",1984isAMidlifeCrisis,2025-05-05T06:06:33,4

They'd rather make it easier for criminals to have guns than ever make it harder for them to have guns.,NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-05T06:29:48,2

"My mother, a lifelong Republican, lives this way.  When I was upset about something, she'd tell me to ""not think about it"", ""pretend it isn't happening"" or ""if it doesn't affect you personally, why do you care?"".
