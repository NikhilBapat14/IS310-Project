"My sympathies are 100% with India. The horrific attack on Mumbai in 2008 came directly from Pakistan. It was a blatant act of war. That's when India should have said ""no more"".",Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T19:12:21,22

I guess the likelihood that such a war would interrupt India's trajectory of overtaking China as a manufacturing power.,Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-27T19:03:29,6

What's more worrying? What I'm gonna have for dinner or anything really.   IDGAF about either country. I don't rely on goods or services from either country.   If they were both to turn each other into seas of glass tomorrow my life wouldn't change beyond getting less spam calls and better customer service when I call certain companies.,tacocookietime,2025-04-27T16:45:41,24
More worrying? Iran having a nuke,Status_Control_9500,2025-04-27T20:34:23,5
"Pakistan has never liked India!  India has firmly laid blame for the atrocity at Pakistan’s door. Police say the suspects are members of the radical Sunni jihadist group, The Resistance Front, an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LT) – ‘the Army of the Righteous’. It appears some of the perpetrators were Pakistani while others may have been Kashmiri. The main aim, but not the only aim of the jihadi group, is to remove India from Kashmir, a goal which originates from India’s partition in 1947.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-28T05:31:42,2

"I think the ""worrying"" part OP was referring to is the fact that both are nuclear powers, and war could go nuclear. Not saying it would, but it could, and the implications are ... worrying.  ETA: article primarily called out the possibility of a Pakistani terror group going global.",NiceSeaworthiness909,2025-04-27T17:35:58,17

"OP article was more concerned about terror I guess, though also nuclear... that being said, I might agree with you on the question of terrorism in India/Pakistan, but not on the question of nuclear war. Easily could become our problem. Like it or not, we share this globe with other people, and sometimes what they do can reach even beyond our giant moats.",NiceSeaworthiness909,2025-04-27T17:43:41,9
