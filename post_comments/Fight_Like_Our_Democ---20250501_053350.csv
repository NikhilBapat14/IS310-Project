The NYT has been complicit in getting this PO~~tu~~S elected.  Where were they when we had the chances to get rid of him?,nwgdad,2025-05-01T09:10:37,5
"Before election, they had thought it was just a cliche.  Now, we have to endure 4 years of destruction and chaos by Trump.  Will Americans survive? I really don't know.",reddittorbrigade,2025-05-01T05:48:36,4

Do tell how this resistance comes together…,Front-Lime4460,2025-05-01T07:36:53,-2
"At the rate tRump is going, believe 4 years may be too long. Looks to be a lot quicker.",pogishushu,2025-05-01T05:56:07,3
People are already mad. Give it a few weeks until American supplies run out and every import doubles in price.  I know the tariffs aren't 100% but why would companies pass up an opportunity to make more money with an easy scapegoat in trumps policies.,scubahood86,2025-05-01T09:22:02,4

I'm also asking! where's the pitchfork assembly? Let's get French in this motherfucker.,Binks-Sake-Is-Gone,2025-05-01T08:21:30,4
The problem is the USA is too big and we don’t have a high speed rail system to all go to Washington. And that’s exactly why they haven’t built one yet.,Front-Lime4460,2025-05-01T12:21:38,2
"There is most likely a protest in your area this Saturday. In your town, your county seat, your state capitol, etc.. It's important to protest locally as well as nationally. Watching protests on TV is great, and we need those, but seeing them in person in your own town can have a bigger impact. When your neighbors and coworkers are standing up, it makes it easier for you to do the same. It gives a sense of purpose, strength,  and courage.  Do what you can. Don't fail to act because you think you won't have a big enough impact.",rocksyoursocks,2025-05-01T18:01:09,3
Oh I totally agree and have been! I even started a subreddit r/tinyprotest ! I just think it would be SO much more effective if we could all protest in DC,Front-Lime4460,2025-05-03T01:00:09,0
