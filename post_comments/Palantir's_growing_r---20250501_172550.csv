Spying on people. Palantir is evil.,NPVT,2025-05-01T17:43:25,24
"Musk tried to out-evil Thiel, but I think that's a tall order.  Welcome to the techno-authoritarian oligarchical dystopia.  It's real.  This is not hyperbole, it is happening, and rather more quickly as of this year: 2025.",drtolmn69,2025-05-01T17:46:44,18
Right as Elon gets hold of every government database and gets to share it between palantir and his own AI systems which will result in more surveillance state and less anonymity and freedom and everything becoming increasingly dependent on digital systems that these boys are also building...,mynamesyow19,2025-05-01T17:43:35,14
America is run by a bunch of nerds. Not the good kind but the Revenge Of The Nerds rape by deception scene kind of nerds. Palantir? Really? Was Skynet taken? It would be funny if so many people weren't being harmed.,Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-01T17:39:57,9
"Given the name of his company, I always wondered if Thiel is like Barney from HIMYM where he always thought the bad guy was the hero of his favorite movies.  Thiel is a Tolkien nut, but in the LOTR, the Palantir is incredibly dangerous because Sauron has his own and can spy on its use through that.   This is akin to naming your surveillance company Big Brother because you are such a fan of Orwell's work.",travio,2025-05-01T18:13:28,8
"Scary shit, I bet every bit of info Elon’s boys skimmed from SSA and IRS has padded their data bases, it’s all over for us.",Reddit_N_Weep,2025-05-01T18:04:26,5

Peter Thiel probably thinks of himself as Sauron.,LordSiravant,2025-05-02T00:13:22,3
"I mean, Thiel probably sees himself as Sauron made real, pretty hard for a petty narcissist with no imagination to top *that* in terms of true evil.",LordSiravant,2025-05-02T00:14:45,2
Don't forget they also installed cameras in the sorority house and sold naked pictures of the girls.,travio,2025-05-01T18:10:40,4
"Yeah, Thiel probably sees himself as Sauron made real. It would fit right into his delusions of grandeur.",LordSiravant,2025-05-02T00:16:32,2
