">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not in free fall,‚Äù Towery said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had a little bit of slippage because he‚Äôs doing a lot. He‚Äôs breaking a lot of eggs to make an omelet, but he‚Äôs not dropping in any significant way.‚Äù  Those ""eggs"" are expensive and people are paying for it.   More of [his supporters](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-voters-regret-voting-disappointed-approval-rating-2066120) are starting to realize that he's is to blame for record-high prices.

Places like McDonald's have had their [worst quarter since covid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/investing/mcdonalds-earnings-first-quarter-2025) because people can't even afford to go there.

"A summary of the article:  >‚ÄúFox News personalities are downplaying Trump‚Äôs declining poll numbers, attributing them to flawed methodology or claiming his agenda is long-term. Despite Fox‚Äôs own poll showing Trump‚Äôs approval at 44%, Trump and his allies, like Stephen Miller, have criticized the pollster and called for their dismissal. This dynamic highlights the internal pressure at Fox to appease Trump, as his criticism can lead to viewer backlash and damage the network‚Äôs reputation.‚Äù ‚Äã",SadPhase2589,2025-05-05T09:29:33,41

"One big problem nobody mentions: Fox News doesn't require a subscription or login. Neither do Brietbart, One America News, or Newsmax. Anyone can read the hard-right sources for free.

"As I see this we are currently getting ready to put our new house on the market.  The one we foolishly bought 2 years ago. I was laid off- thanks to DOGE-  from the government after 18.5 years in an office that ALWAYS had strong bipartisan support.  Now we are losing a lot of money on this house, forced to move to a cheaper state, and at my age I doubt I‚Äôll find another decent job.  I have never in my life been hurt by an immigrant.  Every pain I‚Äôve ever experienced has been due to white men. Sorry if that truth upsets anyone.  That‚Äôs my reality.

"It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see what happens.  At some point, the impact of Trump‚Äôs policies are going to be so front and center, it‚Äôs going to be hard for Fox to ignore. To pick just one example the number of active drilling rigs in the United States is dropping, as is the number of oil drilling jobs. He told a big whopper at the very start, that he would both increase drilling in the United States and decrease the cost of gasoline. For one of those things to be true, the other has to be false. Foreign oil is still much cheaper than fracked oil, and no executive order can change that",Blake_Ashby,2025-05-05T09:34:50,124

"the funny thing about markets is that price changes are the inversion of quantity changes. More oil in the market means lower price for oil. The problem is that lower prices means *oil producers make less money*! Big Oil doesn't want lower prices! not because they are greedy (which they are), but because digging up oil costs money, and if you are spending billions to make millions, then you can expect your investors to fire you out of a cannon.
