Vance go visit Putin in person. Why? Oh no particular reason.,ImaginationToForm2,2025-05-08T02:31:39,1
Agree.  It's so bad that it's hard not to believe Russia doesn't either have something on them or are giving something to them. The alternative explanation is mind-boggling amounts of ignorance and stupidity. I guess Occam and Hanlon's razors apply but... it's just so hard to believe anyone can be that stupid.  Not only did everyone tell them play-by-play exactly what Russia was doing but had they been paying attention they would've seen it unfold in real time over the past several years. That's ignoring their actions in Ukraine a decade ago and Russia's typical actions throughout history.  And yet they still adopted an anti-Ukraine position and played right into Putin's hands while parroting Russian narratives that undermine Ukraine's actions in defending their country. Only now are they (maybe) starting to see. It's unreal.,-CJF-,2025-05-07T16:59:51,7
