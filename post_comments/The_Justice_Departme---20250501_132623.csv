"We either started at a preposterously high point and the fall we're experiencing as a country is over a vast distance, or the MAGA movement is a void with no vessel and no bottom (like Trump's persona).   It seems to be a never-ending descent.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-01T13:31:19,29

"Schools have been resegregating for decades now. It’s just unofficial. Neighborhoods are segregated by income, which tends to mirror race inequalities. Also, if your neighborhood schools are bad—aka—too many brown kids—parents choice the kids to the whiter, wealthier schools.",Responsible-Bat-5390,2025-05-01T13:45:54,16

This would be news if states hadn’t been doing this already since the 80’s and 90’s.

"Reconstruction was a fucking mistake. We should have punished the South for their treason, not coddled them with rivers of money and concessions.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-01T13:41:20,32
There’s a lot of blue cities in the south. Major cities with lots of people in them. It’s not that simple.,MelpomeneAndCalliope,2025-05-01T14:36:48,4

"No, we fucked up by half-assing Reconstruction. We also fucked up by not holding the leaders of the confederacy legally responsible for what happened. Every single slave owner should have had their property seized and sold with the proceeds going to their former slaves.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-05-01T13:52:25,28
"Sure but you’re forgetting the deep seated racism that existed everywhere. The north was not exempt, they largely disagreed with slavery but ideology wasn’t much better.",hmr0987,2025-05-01T13:59:49,12

"Sadly, I've found that most coastal liberals don't have a care to spare for any of the millions of Southern liberals. I often get ""no one is making you live there,"" as if there couldn't possibly be anything remotely decent about living in the South.",robbodee,2025-05-01T16:34:53,3
"So? The South, specifically the states, are entities that do things that we need to stop being impacted by. You have to help yourself before you help others, or you all wind up needing help.",Spa_5_Fitness_Camp,2025-05-01T15:42:31,1
"And that sucks, but the rest of the South is overwhelming the liberal parts of those states, just like how the Republican parts of the country’s land mass is acting like an anchor to the forward progress of the US.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-05-01T18:22:13,1
"And furthermore, we have all participated in not dealing with racism in this country. The world takes our lead on a lot of stuff. If we embraces slavery as a crime on humanity and really work on it Jane Elliott style, life would be so much better. Going to a school in Harlem in the 50's and early 60's was fascinating. It was the Civil Rights Movement. And Thurgood Marshall had already won the Brown vs Board of Ed. Yet it took decades to make it really happen. Boston fought til the mid 70's. I remember that horrible photo.  Yet in NYC Public School system remains the most segregated school system in the country.
