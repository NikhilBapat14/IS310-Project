"If they (Trumps administration) ignore the Supreme Court and government employees (ICE, police) blindly follow unlawful orders, then we are witnessing the complete breakdown of our system of government. Our republic will be over.  Democratic republics (USA, France, Brazil etc) are fragile things compared to democratic monarchies (UK, Canada, Japan).   Without a semi-permanent incumbent to intercede and act as referee if needed, [democratic] republics entirely rely on the people trusting the system and the leaders behaving honorably and respecting the system.  The US is unusual in that the system - the constitution - has lasted as long as it has, surviving a second war of independence (1812), a civil war, world wars, and economic crises.  Now though, it is clear the leaders have zero respect for the constitution, and the people have lost their trust in it.  Unless the situation changes in the immediate future, we may as well mentally prepare ourselves to accept that this republic is over.  I was listening to podcast about the Irish war of independence (succession from the UK) 100 years ago. One of the first things to go, when a system of government is ending, is the ability to finance itself. Why pay taxes to a system you neither trust or believe in ? On a large enough scale, how can there be consequences ?  I hope I’m wrong about this, but having seen government failures first hand, I fear I’m right.",Loud-Cat6638,2025-04-11T09:51:25,20

It said part of the lower court’s order requiring the government to “effectuate” his return was unclear and needed further review. >  > The court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned.

"Does everyone really think this will be the end of Dump-Trump in 4 years. He said during his first inauguration that he wants to be king. When told, we do not have kings in America, he said that one day he will be the king. And what do kings have? Endless power without restrictions and the knowledge that they will always be the ruler. The first group of people fired were those from each branch, department, location of inspectors who have one focus, to keep Everyone accountable. I think we are far- far- far behind, but it is time to advertise this information on the signs and put a bunch of signs out for every single person that has kissed his ring. We should all know their names and states and job titles. I spoke with people these past 3 days, who are unaware of anything that has happened. Not all people watch the news or read the news on the computer. I know it sounds strange.
