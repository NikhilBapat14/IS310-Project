"The only upside is the demand for use cars is about to go through the roof, which means trade-in value is also going to climb a lot.  So if you were already planning on getting a new car, and your old one is paid off, then you might come out ahead in the next few months. Once those interest rates start climbing again, it is going to be awful.",Ayste,2025-04-03T07:18:33,15
"Congrats MAGA, the stock market is crashing, the economy is about to nose dive faster than the planes falling out of the sky, but hey, you “owned us”!! Trump got his votes. Thanks for playing!   Ps how long until his supporters start touting their new angle: “we WANTED the economy to tank!” ? Or “this is Biden’s fault!” ?",Sophiesmommy613,2025-04-03T09:28:22,9

"> Buckle up, car buyers.  >  > President Donald Trump’s array of tariffs will increase new-car prices anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. >  > At a time when new cars cost nearly $50,000 on average and auto-loan interest rates are high, Ives’s Wednesday estimate could mean already expensive automobiles will be further out of reach for many working Americans. >  > Trump on Wednesday afternoon detailed the particulars of his new tariff plan. It’s a flat rate of 10% as a minimum, plus an extra reciprocal rate per country that’s half of the nation’s tariffs towards the U.S. This is on top of several new tariffs the administration has already put into effect. Tariffs of 25% on auto imports are scheduled to take effect Thursday. >  > Ahead of Trump’s Rose Garden announcement, Ives anticipated price hikes on new cars of $5,000 to $10,000 “out of the gates.”  >  > The average transaction price on a new car was $48,039 in February, according to Cox Automotive. Adding $5,000 more to that price would be a 10% increase, while adding $15,000 would be a 31% mark-up.",progress18,2025-04-03T07:03:26,5

You'd have to have a fairly new-ish paid off car to come out ahead in that scenario,Lengthiest_Dad_Hat,2025-04-03T09:48:10,5

"He's also trying to create a bogus ""sovereign wealth fund"" where all the tariff money will pile up so it can then be stolen by him & his buddies.

">already expensive automobiles will be further out of reach for many working Americans  I went car-free in 2012 by moving into a higher density area with public transit. I am a single person, no kids. I grew up in a town where car ownership is mandatory. It was awful as a kid as my parents weren't available to give me rides places, so I had to depend on an inadequate transit system. I then started driving and fucking hated sitting in traffic.  I am so, so tired of being a car-dependent country. $50k for a continuously depreciating asset that needs to be replaced every 10 years? *Fuck that*. I would be more than happy to contribute taxes towards more robust public transit systems that employ American auto workers via service contracts.",pigglesthepup,2025-04-03T08:01:28,5

Yep! There’s a f*cking virus in this country of absolute brainwashed imbeciles and it’s no longer just uneducated republicans in poor red states. Yes let’s blame Trans folks and asylum seekers for all of our problems! “They’re ruining the country!” As their orange God takes a flamethrower to the country.  I just saw a post where a maggot was trying to argue that Kamala would have been worse. And then proceeded to exclaim “I’m not one of those people that blindly supports everything the president does”. Someone please take me off of this planet. I can’t do this anymore. I cannot be surrounded with this amount of stupidity and cruelty. JFC.,Sophiesmommy613,2025-04-03T11:30:10,3
