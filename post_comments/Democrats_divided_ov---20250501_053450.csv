"Make fun of the administration while talking about the real effects. This White House cannot stand being made fun of. But the current Democratic Congress is built to talk to donor types, not normal people. So this is almost impossible for them",iishouldchangemyname,2025-05-01T05:49:32,7
">“I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” the progressive senator said.   This. Oligarchy is too big a word?   It's the most groan inducing cringe watching a Democrat strategically dumb down the message.    It comes off as condescending and pandering to a level of stupid they're never going to reach beyond clips on Fox.   They're either taking their base and reachable voters for granted, or... they have an insanely low opinion of who they should be appealing to.   Stop. Be real.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T06:00:43,12

"*Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), arguably the most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbent, told a constituent at a town hall last week that he “strongly” agrees Trump needs to be impeached. Ossoff noted the scenario was unlikely, given Democrats are in the minority.   However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave a less direct answer when asked whether he agrees with Ossoff, noting during an interview on CNN “it’s too far away to judge.”*  Yeah Schumer’s right.

"Of course they are divided.  To me, it seems simple: be genuine, be a problem solver, be available, don't put EVERYTHING on the political scale and then have some talking heads tell you how you should approach the people. Talk to the people and not the pundits.  The pundits constantly get it wrong (because they live in their own heads and not in the world of the people).   But this is just wishful thinking on my part.  The Dems will continue to be political creatures, looking at how to save their own skins instead of ours.

She is absolutely feckless and she wants to sweep huge issues that are leading to fascism under the rug. And focus solely on economic issues as if Trump did run on a platform that would ruin the economy.

"Yeah, like…The Oligarchs are just the obscenely wealthy people who are trying to wrest control of our lives to make themselves richer. They’re literally on TV *doing that.*   Everyone in this country gets that the rich get richer while the rest of us muddle through. It’s ingrained in us.   Whether it overcomes everything else is unpredictable, but  the reason Sanders’ message about Oligarchy seems to resonate across the political divide while others don’t is pretty simple: he’s emphatically, memably pointing at the *very specific* ultra-wealthy, ultra-powerful people and  saying “these are the ones making it harder for us, on purpose.”",coltvahn,2025-05-01T09:13:26,3

Democrats already do extremely well with people who are educated. They aren't having problems making inroads with people who can understand complexity and nuance.

"Yup.  >“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.”  Meanwhile, you have China setting the tone this time around by not playing games with Trump and Republicans. US Senate can't even have all the Democrat Senators show up for a vote.    Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-05-01T06:22:49,2
