There will be a judge somewhere that will stop this. Need to graduate from EOs to actually passing legislation,WuFlu_Tang_Clan,2025-05-02T06:31:46,377

NPR should go away.  PBS is good though... it was free for poor families that wanted something good for their kids to watch. I wouldn't throw it in the same bucket as NPR.,madonna-boy,2025-05-02T13:56:02,56

It’s a great day for the libs to start funding their favorite media networks personally 👏🏾,Whole-Essay640,2025-05-02T07:38:16,-10

"I never understood why any tax dollars go to PBS. And yes, I do on occasion watch and think they put on some good shows like Nature and Frontline. Sesame Street was a staple when the kids were young.  I do agree that this like some other things need to be done via legislation. All EOs can be undone by another.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-02T09:39:15,-11

It's ok. I'm told the function almost entirely on private donations so not having taxpayer money shouldn't matter that much and couldn't possibly affect operations all that much. Right?.... right?,Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-05T11:49:55,0
"I think this EO is pretty shaky and you are right that actually passing legislation is the real solution. If Congress approves funds for NPR, does the president really have the power to just say no?",Key_Bored_Whorier,2025-05-02T09:02:06,148
Also even if the executive orders are upheld they’ll likely be overturned in 4 years when Trump is out of office. Legislation is a better long term solution,Germy_1114,2025-05-02T18:13:59,11
You're excepting the feckless Johnson branch of the party to actually do something?  Fat fucking chance.,pimanac,2025-05-02T12:44:36,9
Trump needs to step up his pressure on Congress. He has enough support to threaten their reelections at least decently effectively,fordr015,2025-05-07T11:07:27,1

Now we need the gop controlled house and senate to make it permanent.  Big Bird can fund himself!,j3remy2007,2025-05-02T04:30:09,19
"> If Congress approves funds for NPR, does the president really have the power to just say no?  Absolutely not, once it becomes law and the window to veto has passed. I'm shocked that so much of congress is willing to be so consistently undermined by this executive legislation and be accessories to abusing the constitution. And I'm shocked that Republicans are so willing to set precedent for future Democrat governments to do the same. It's short-sighted, irresponsible, illegal, and frankly embarrassing",cracka_azz_cracka,2025-05-02T12:44:03,225
"me. I watched when I was a kid and we didn't have cable.   sure there are apps now, but you need to figure out what's in them... have one channel is a lot easier (and doesn't require your internet to be working / fast).",madonna-boy,2025-05-02T16:13:14,45
HBO has been funding Big Bird for a while.,ngoni,2025-05-02T06:11:33,7
"I'm not surprised at all. Congress is deeply entrenched in the uniparty, does not truly care who is in charge (D or R) and has consistently shown the only real interest they have is in lining their own pocketbooks. It's a retirement home funded on tax payer dollars.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-02T21:07:31,15
"IIRC, that contract has expired.  However the merchandising alone should be able to fund the show.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-02T07:44:34,3
