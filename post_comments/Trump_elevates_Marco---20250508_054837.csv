"I’m surprised by Rubio. I know he’s been supportive of Trump and he’s an opportunist but I didn’t anticipate he had that real darkness of MAGA in him. He’s not only carrying out and advocating for the worst of Trump (instead of being the adult in the room), he’s doing it *eagerly.*  I guess the bar for him was low for me but he still failed to clear it.  The only good news is that Rubio has been the butt of too many jokes, is too spineless a sycophant to be a leader in his own right. In a free and fair election I doubt he’d even get a nomination, let alone an electoral win. We’ve seen time and time again people try to copy Trump and it really only works for Trump because he’s charismatic and a cynical master manipulator of human nature. Rubio’s just a weasel.",ennuiinmotion,2025-05-08T07:03:44,2

I once worked at a company where the CEO would hire two people with the same title and overlapping responsibilities  that both reported to him.
