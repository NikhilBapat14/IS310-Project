I work for an apparel manufacturer and this is how we are going to manage tariffs. Keeping the tariff as a separate line item on the invoices to our dealers allows us to keep wholesale and MSRPs the same and also be able to pivot quickly when tariffs are changed.

That‚Äôs how you know this is all coordinated propaganda. It‚Äôs a warning to other companies thinking about itemizing tariffs in their pricing. Trump gets his threat out and Bezos gets public sympathy for trying to navigate around the evil dictator to be transparent with customers. Easy win for both of them.,Imhappy_hopeurhappy2,2025-04-29T11:53:30,1

"As I said, retailers will not benefit from this. Tesla likely won‚Äôt because while they use a lot of domestic sources, a significant portion of their supply chain still comes from foreign sources. But how the auto industry as a whole will fare is still being determined as deals are made. Steel and aluminum will do well, and that brings up heavy equipment and construction along with it. Domestic beer and liquor should see gains too. Mining will definitely boom. Energy. Defense. Semiconductors were already being pushed to manufacture in the US under Biden so they‚Äôll just continue on that path. Lots of winners, but the losers will be retailers and regular folks like us.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-29T09:43:46,2

"He‚Äôs also getting paid back in billions of government contracts that he otherwise would not have won.     While SpaceX probably would have continued its current work, It‚Äôs incredibly unlikely that Harris would have needed to give them a multi billion dollar contract to create Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden dome‚Äù to protect us from Canadians lobbing missiles over the border.  Mostly because without Trump the idea of fighting an actual war with our closest allies and neighbors would have been unthinkable.

"Let's go through the math problem as laid out in the article. I'll make up the starting tariff rate to simplify the math.  A tariff of 10% has a tariff cost of $10 for every $100 you import. If your tariff costs increase by 145% (as laid out in the article), your new tariff cost for that $100 of imports is the original tariff cost plus the cost increase. $10 plus $14.50 (145% of $10) for a new tariff cost of $24.50.   Now this is based just on the info in the article, since this administration seems to issue new EOs every hour to rescind or modify its own policies. It's impossible to keep current, by design.",Login_rejected,2025-04-29T16:59:44,0
