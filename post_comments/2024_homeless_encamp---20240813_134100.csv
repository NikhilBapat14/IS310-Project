They are completely different causes and people. Hoovervilles were simply people who could not find work and generally filled with people who moved into an area to find such. It was temporary accommodations for drifting workers.    Modern homeless encampments are not people who are simply out of work but otherwise well adjusted. We have enough programs and systems that rational people don't fall into the cracks on the street and stay there. Rather the people stuck on the street are those with addiction and mental health issues that prevent them from holding down a job and generally following the rules in society enough to exist as a normal person in it. There's no lack of entry-level jobs for people in urban America.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-08-13T14:08:34,3
"Even during the worst of the Depression, most Hooverville residents continued to seek employment, often taking backbreaking seasonal jobs like picking and packing field crops. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1939 novel, “The Grapes of Wrath,” writer John Steinbeck, vividly described his hardships as a young farmworker in the “Weedpatch” Hooverville near Bakersfield, California. “There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation,” he wrote of the squalled camp. “There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize.”",semideclared,2024-08-13T17:39:53,2
"The causes of homelessness are different now - people can find work, but can't make enough to afford rent.  No, our safety net is not strong enough to help those who need it most.  There's not enough funding for mental health and affordable housing for those that need it.   What help is out there is not easy to access and there are waitlists.",Lefty522,2024-08-14T12:34:43,1
"OP mentions immigrants and asylum seekers.  These mirror the description of Hoovervillians, looking for seasonal work and accepting back-breaking jobs with poor conditions.   The other phenomenon, ‘modern homeless encampments’ brings to mind the mentality ill who originally were released en masse by the Reagan Administration.  These folks can’t function well in society as little has been done to address the mental health crisis in the last 40 years, causing this population to swell.    Disclaimer: this is very broad-brush. I’ve glossed over a lot of grey area.",bigdaddy4dakill,2024-08-14T08:55:56,2
"It's a more nuanced.  Today areas that have a lot of jobs often have very tight and expensive housing markets, so there are certainly people out there who have work but are still sleeping in a tent or, perhaps more likely, a vehicle.",PlinyToTrajan,2024-08-13T18:52:52,2
"Realistically they should be living with roommates unless they aren't well adjusted enough that other people would like to be around them. It's not nice living with three to four other people, but it's a lot nicer than living in a car or tent.   Hoovervilles sprang up because mass migrations meant there literally wasn't enough housing for people, not even in so-called flophouses.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-08-14T07:30:04,2
