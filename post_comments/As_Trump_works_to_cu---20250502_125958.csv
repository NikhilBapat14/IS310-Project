It‚Äôs funny how much Republicans claim to love America while simultaneously working so hard to eliminate so many things that have actually made America great ‚Ä¶,OrionDax,2025-05-02T13:26:22,29
I sincerely think some Trump supporters are really angry that so many kids loved Mr. Rogers. The good he did is exactly why they want to destroy PBS.,Independent-Stay-593,2025-05-02T13:34:32,15
"More Mr. Rogers and less hate out of Washington.  It is not difficult.    As someone who watched the show as a child.  I like you too Mr. Rogers just the way you were.  Thanks for the memories.

"Violence and hate get the algorithms going. The algorithms are connected to the content which is connected to the viewer who is connected to a keyboard that is connected to social media. What a tangled web. To talk about feelings and ideas without shaming, blaming and labeling others is not what the internet does best. And here we are, lacking in kindness and consideration of others, with no concept of civic duty.",LaVie_en_Prose,2025-05-02T14:58:10,3

The radical left Mr.Rogers is taking both HOSTILE and POLITICAL things to our kids we must stop him from brainwashing the youth with compassion. As of today Neighborhood of Make Believe will face a 10% tariffs till Mr. Rogers agrees to teach less radical stuff. Sesame Street will face a 25% tariffs unless they agree to let the beautiful Melina Trump on the show. Thank you for your attention President Donald Trump.,OhioRanger_1803,2025-05-02T13:29:26,9
