Sane washing to the Nth degree.  Colossal failure is now stunning success.  War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance is strength.  Welcome to the United States of Trump.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T03:50:16,10

It’s an opportunity to recognize just how badly our 3 branches of government are and to do something to make it right.    We can’t go on like this.  Something has to change.,Kantsas,2025-04-23T06:20:57,1
I tried reading it. The being an absolute failure is somehow a sign of success gimmick doesn’t work or make sense.,black_flag_4ever,2025-04-23T06:40:52,1
