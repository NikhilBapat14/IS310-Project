"For his birthday, which just so happens to be the Army’s birthday. This year in particular, the Army’s 250-year birthday. Don’t think that might be the cause for the parade?",MCRNRocinante,2025-05-02T20:28:27,-4

"Look, two things can be true at the same time. Is it more than a coincidence that the administration would be in favor of a parade that lands on President Trump’s birthday - for sure.   Is it also downright intentionally ignorant to ignore and, for journalists, not report on the fact that it’s the Army’s 250th birthday? Also yes.   You don’t have to be a MAGA hat wearer just because you can recognize some basic facts.",MCRNRocinante,2025-05-02T20:38:22,0
"[Here are President Ford’s remarks](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/sites/default/files/pdf_documents/library/document/0122/1252364.pdf), from a parade, held in Ft Benning for the Army’s 200th birthday.   It’s not abnormal. The size and scope, I’m sure, will be. That’s also just in keeping with this President’s MO though if we’re all being honest with ourselves.",MCRNRocinante,2025-05-02T20:41:44,0
"see i’d say you’re spot on but, unfortunately dump has stated a while now it was for *him* not for this celebration. while yes it could also be for the 250th year for americas army. you have to remember how dump is setting this up.   people aren’t looking at this to be proud of their history, the lens is focused on trump and making it about HIM. this parade is for him. they couldn’t care LESS about the usa military. he has already made threats on them to put them on american soil, and is actively taking away veterans benefits here. so when you tell me it’s both! i think its fantasy talk, its not for both it’s for trump and we all know it.",Akraxs,2025-05-03T02:58:01,2
