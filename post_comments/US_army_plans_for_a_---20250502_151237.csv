"And after the tanks roll down the street chewing up the pavement, guess who get to pay for fixing the roads? D.C. who doesn't even have a voting member in Congress, not to mention a couple of senators.  Friggin Wyoming, with way fewer people, has better representation than DC.  Plus DC cops will probably have to be paid overtime to provide security; who's paying for that?  Also: the after-event trash collection.
