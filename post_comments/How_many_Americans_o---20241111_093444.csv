"The best I can offer you is anecdotal evidence from working elections.   The Presidential election always turns out more voters than mid terms and other elections and during those presidential elections I often find myself filling out quite a few statewide ballots (a ballot that only includes the President and statewide issues) and I also hand out some presidential provisional ballots as well (which is only voting for the president).  Both the statewide and provisional ballots are given out in unique circumstances but when I give the voter the option to take one of those ballots or go to another polling site closer to their home county they respond with ""thats okay I just want to vote for the President""   I also have been involved in balancing the ballots so while im not really pouring over them, I do see plenty with just the top of the ticket marked.   Hopefully someone else on here can give you better data and more detailed information than I have, but just based on my observations over the years it is a relatively common practice.",MTBadtoss,2024-11-11T11:38:35,4

"I also have anecdotal evidence from working elections. We have to go through the ballots at the end of the night to look for write-ins. We saw a few with just the President marked, but it was only a few. It happens, but it's not a widespread issue. At least in my precinct.",waterbuffalo750,2024-11-12T06:40:22,1
So what happens to the rest of the names on the ballot? Is a vote automatically cast for the candidates in the chosen President's party? Or is nothing assumed and those votes go to waste?,MarionetteScans,2024-11-21T10:41:02,1
If you leave all of the other sections blank then your ballot was cast only for the president and no votes were cast for any other candidate or ballot issue.,MTBadtoss,2024-11-21T11:36:31,1
