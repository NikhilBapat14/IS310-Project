DOGE is the waste.  Spending all that money and found zero real savings.  All purported savings found are so far misrepresentations.,thieh,2025-05-02T12:49:23,19
Seems counterproductive to pay those high wages for people that there only job is to terminate people making less then them.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-02T12:59:43,7

"I hate Trump and Musk with a burning passion, but I work in the DC area as a contractor and these numbers are not out of line for computer specialists.  This is an expensive area to work and live in.  If anything I’m shocked how industry average it is.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-02T13:05:39,-4

"All the savings were to Musk's bank accounts, dismantling investigations against him that were going to hit him with hefty fines, and of course giving himself all of those government contracts that were a huge conflict of interest.  If he doesn't end up in prison, then it's only because the country never manages to revert to the rule of law and this nightmare never ends.",RealGianath,2025-05-02T12:55:21,12
"Maybe that's average for specialists with years of experience, but not kids who just graduated college. I work with computers for a large company in a similarly expensive area and make less than a third of that. System admins here make less than that. Security admins and systems directors might make close to that amount.",RedactedLactic,2025-05-02T14:06:16,11
"They were instantly given GS 15 Step 5 salaries, which is basically the max salary ANY government employee can earn, typically after decades in the job and multiple promotions.",streamofthesky,2025-05-03T13:22:23,1
