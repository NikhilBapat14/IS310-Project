"Think about all of the worst national disasters, like hurricane Katrina, that have happened since 1979 (when FEMA was established) and think about how all of them were that bad WITH FEMA and how much worse it will be if there is no FEMA.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-07T14:52:07,6
FEMA services red states vastly more than blue. Blue states that most get serviced by FEMA are also wealthy enough to manage their own disaster response.   This idea primarily hurts Trump voters.,Motodoso,2025-05-07T14:54:14,4
"So if this is another government service cut, does this mean we pay less federal tax, or is this just going to be more austerity i.e. we just get less services for the same money?",mkt853,2025-05-07T15:08:04,4

"Red states don’t like the Federal government sticking their nose in and helping people after a hurricane or tornado.  As far as MAGA is concerned, FEMA can take their free money and free emergency shelter and shove it up their ass.  Only the strong and wealthy deserve to survive. /s",JC2535,2025-05-07T20:47:04,1

"The states with the least resources to make up for this loss are the ones who are cheering it on. Meanwhile, in all those ""high tax"" states, state governments will be able to make up at least some of the shortfall.   Alabama, Mississippi? ""Sorry, we just don't have the funds in the budget for disaster relief. You should have taken personal responsibility and paid for flood insurance. We'll have emergency services in your town as soon as the flood waters recede, hope you have canned goods. If you're trapped on your roof, bring sunscreen.""",spark3h,2025-05-07T14:41:37,6

Oh and that flood insurance that used to be subsidized by FEMA. That's no longer available or cost 10x as much,someguy7710,2025-05-07T15:00:30,5
The only good thing about Trump is that he puts a magnifying glass to all the horrible republican policies.  Unfortunately people are going to die for it.,knightcrawler75,2025-05-07T15:06:55,2
