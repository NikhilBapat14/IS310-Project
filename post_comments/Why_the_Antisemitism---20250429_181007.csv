I feel like it’s obvious that the goal is this:  * Use anti-semitism as a way to go after liberals.  * Then use the liberal purge as an argument to justify actual antisemitism in a “Look what they made us do!” moment.,FawningDeer37,2025-04-29T18:18:47,50

">But for many of the 21 Republicans who voted against the bill last year, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, the problem is an example that says accusing Jews of deicide is antisemitic.

Now they are showing the beginning of their true colors. They just leveraged antisemitism to remove freedom of speech.  And their whole support of Israel is to push as many Jews as possible to leave the US.,origamipapier1,2025-04-29T18:19:22,11

Isn’t this the party that wanted to bring back the statement “Merry Christmas”?    Does it feel like there probably wouldn’t even be a Christian movement if Jesus hadn’t been killed & crucified ?    Isn’t the crucifixion the event that led to all the apostles going out and spreading the word of Jesus ?  How the hell do we have a Christianity if Jesus didn’t die for all our sins and become one with the Lord our God?    Just asking the questions here…,animalslover4569,2025-04-29T18:42:22,2

Dude I been listening to modern American theology and nobody's saying Jews killed Jesus. Kind of hard to wrap your mind around but they're saying **Jesus killed Jesus**. Stuff about the cross and paying the collective price for sin and well planned human sacrifice and other stuff. I'm not kidding.    Edit: far as I can tell the only gripe they got against Jews is they won't turn Christian. But that's just the gripe they got against everyone. ,Voaracious,2025-04-29T18:28:02,-4
"Hmm...honestly, they are right you khow.   I don't believe in superstitious stuffs, but according to historical evidence, it is pretty clear that a man now called ""Jesus"" had been killed by the Jews in Judaea.  Of course, attributing responsibility to all Jews are a different matter, which is a stance [repudated by the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostra_aetate), but given there is a [very long history of theological debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide) of this matter, i do think it would violate freedom of religion if it was banned, and wouldn't fit the intent of the bill, which was to protect Jewish people and insitution from radical left and Islamist activists.",huysocialzone,2025-04-29T22:56:57,-2

"It may protect us from “radical leftists and Islamists”.   It will do nothing to protect us against Christians who are responsible for more Jewish deaths over millennia than either of those two groups. Those deaths originated in large part because of the trope that “the Jews killed Jesus”.   That lie laid the foundation for the Inquisition and the slaughter of Jewish communities leading up to it, and after it. It’s came to its fruition with the Holocaust.  By allowing it to continue to be used by Christian narratives, they continue to sanction Christianity’s miserable history of antisemitism.",progressiveprepper,2025-04-30T04:42:36,1
"There is honestly a very tragic version of events where, once Trump and his ilk are removed from office, both Judaism and efforts to clamp down on antisemitism get viewed as being part of the far-right and fascist by virtue of their association with Trump's actions, setting back Jewish relations in America by decades. It wouldn't be the first time something like this has happened historically.

"I planned to respond but some of it was already told by the other comment, so i will just include my add on.  \+ As the other commenter said, even if ""Jews kill Jesus"" had been technically inaccurate, it is still a historical fact that the action of some Jews in Judaea had lead to the death of a man now called ""Jesus"". Therefore the phrase still had some historical accuracy.  \+ Plus, i think that, if you looked from the viewpoint of both sides at the time, even if you are a christian, i don't think you could blame the Jewish judicial authority from doing that. There are cult leaders and trickster everywhere, from the eye of the Jewish officials at them time, how can you tell that the man called ""Jesus"" will be a character of religious and historical significance rather than a scammer or cultist?   \+ Also, while i don't believe the Roman authority is mainly responsible for his death, i believe it can't be denied that their presence influence things, remember, Christianity was a very divisive movement within the Roman Empire, with its monotheism clashing with the usually fluid and tolerant pagan belief of the Roman, which is why it was prosocuted so much, if the Jewish authority didn't take action against him and his movement cause chaos who khew what will happen to their local autonomy?",huysocialzone,2025-04-30T04:21:23,1

No - it’s not…Christians appropriated our scriptures in an effort to lend credibility to theirs. Then Christians labeled ours  “old” in an effort to position your idea of a “new” covenant - replacing Jews and the pre-existing covenant we have with G-d. This is called “supersecessionism” and is considered antisemitic in nature - it is also called  “replacement theology”.   It is indeed disrespectful… the least Christians could do is call our scriptures by their correct name…that is the “Tanach”.,progressiveprepper,2025-04-30T12:51:44,1
