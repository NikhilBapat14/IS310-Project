He keeps saying that the elections are rigged and described how they might have been rigged and pointed out who might have rigged them . . . now they're just throwing around a third term like that is okay.,1984isAMidlifeCrisis,2025-04-24T16:26:37,4

What could go wrong letting the guy who broke two and a half centuries tradition of peaceful transfer of power have the office back?  How could that possibly spin out of control?  He‚Äôs never willingly going to relinquish the executive branch.,TheOtherBookstoreCat,2025-04-24T17:29:30,3

"He'll be 82. Biden is a health nut compared with him. Who knows what sort of physical shape he'll be in then. Plus, his approval is already at 40% after just 95 days.

I don't think Trump believes his standing in the polls. The only way for him to run for a third term is to rewrite the Constitution or use military force after declaring martial law,invalidpassword,2025-04-24T16:38:03,1

I would rather light the money on fire and shove it up my poop hole than spend it on a hat like that.  Not one dime that I can control will ever go to that horrible man and his basket of deplorables.,BadgeOfDishonour,2025-04-24T16:27:31,5

"The 22nd amendment prevents someone from being **elected** president for more than 2 terms. Doesn't say anything about someone **assuming** the presidency through non-elected means.  Trump can just set up a system where one of his lackeys runs for president, with Trump as VP.  Lackey resigns as president on January 20, and Trump takes over for 3rd term as president.  People try to sue to stop this, but the conservative dominated SCOTUS rules that nothing prevents this ""Trump as VP"" strategy.",Brock_Hard_Canuck,2025-04-24T22:02:25,1
